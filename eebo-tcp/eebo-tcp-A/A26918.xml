            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <opener>Reader,</opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F thou think this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
both <hi>superfluous</hi>
and <hi>Defective,</hi> when so
many larger have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
done the work al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
I shall not at all gainsay the
latter, nor much the former. The
reason of my writing it was the
necessity and request of some very
upright Godly persons, who are
lately faln into doubt or Errour, in
point of the Sabbath day, conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that because the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
was Written in Stone,
<pb facs="tcp:59348:3"/>
it is wholly unchangeable, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
the seventh day Sabbath
in force, and that the Lords day is
not a Day separated by God to holy
Worship. I knew that there was
enough written on this Subject long
agoe; But, 1. Much of it is in
Latine; 2. Some Writings which
prove the abrogation of the Jewish
Sabbath, do withal treat so loosly
of the Lords day, as that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
a Confutation in the latter as
well as a commendation for the
former. 3. Some are so large that
the persons that I write for will
hardly be brought to read them.
4. Most go upon those grounds,
which I take to be less clear; and
build so much more than I can do
on the fourth Commandment and
on many passages of the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and plead so much for the
old Sabbatical notion and rest, that
I fear this is the chief occasion of
<pb facs="tcp:59348:3"/>
many peoples Errours; who when
they find themselves in a wood of
difficulties, and nothing plain and
convincing that is pleaded with
them, do therefore think it safest
to stick to the old Jewish Sabbath
The friends and acquaintance of
some of these persons importuning
me, to take the plainest and nearest
way to satisfie such honest doubters,
I have here done it according to my
judgement: not contending against
any that go another way to work,
but thinking my self that this is very
clear and satisfactory; <hi>viz.</hi> to prove,
1. That Christ did Commission his
Apostles to Teach us all things
which he commanded, and to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Orders in his Church, 2. And
that he gave them his spirit to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
them to do all this Infallibly, by
bringing all his words to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,
and by leading them
into all truth. 3. And that his Apostles
<pb facs="tcp:59348:4"/>
by this spirit did <hi>de facto</hi> separate the
Lords day, for holy Worship, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in Church-Assemblies, and
declared the cessation of the Jewish
Sabbaths. 4. And that as this
change had the very same Author
as the Holy Scriptures (the Holy
Ghost in the Apostles) so that <hi>fact</hi>
hath the same kind of proof, that
we have of the Canon and the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
and uncorruptness of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Scripture Books and Texts:
And that, if so much Scripture as
mencioneth the keeping of the
Lords day, expounded by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
and Practice of the Universal
Church from the dayes of the
Apostles, (all keeping this day as
holy, without the dissent of any
one Sect, or single person that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
to have read of,) I say if
all this History will not fully prove
the point of fact, that this day was
kept in the Apostles times, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
<pb facs="tcp:59348:4"/>
by their appointment,
then the same proof will not serve
to evince that any text of Scripture
is Canonical, and uncorrupted; nor
can we think that any thing in the
world, that is past, can have Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
proof.</p>
            <p>I have been put to say somewhat
particularly out of Antiquity for
this evidence of the fact, because it
is that which I lay the greatest stress
upon. But I have not done it so
largely as might be done, 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I would not lose the unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Reader in a Wood of History,
nor overwhelm him instead of edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
him. 2. Because it is done
already in Latine by Dr. <hi>Young</hi> in his
<hi>Dies Dominica</hi> (under the name of
<hi>Theophilus Loncardiensis;</hi>) which I
take to be the moderatest, soundest
and strongest Treatise on this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
that I have seen; Though
Mr. <hi>Cawdry,</hi> and <hi>Palmer</hi> (joyntly)
<pb facs="tcp:59348:5"/>
have done well and at greater
length: and Mr. <hi>Eaton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hard,</hi>
Dr. <hi>Bound, Wallaeus, Rivet,</hi> and
my dear friend Mr. <hi>George Abbot</hi>
against <hi>Broad</hi> have said very much:
And in their way, Dr. <hi>White,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi>
Bishop <hi>Ironside,</hi> Mr. <hi>Brierwood,</hi> &amp;c.
3. I chose most of the same Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> himself pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth,
because he being the man
that I am most put to defend my
self against, his confessions are my
advantage. 4. And if I had been
willing, I could not have been so
full in this, as the Subject will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speak,
because I have almost eleven
years been separated from my Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary,
and long from the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
of any ones else.</p>
            <p>I much pitty and wonder at those
Godly men, who are so much for
stretching the words of Scripture,
to a sense that other men cannot
find in them, as that in the word
<pb facs="tcp:59348:5"/>
[<hi>Graven Images</hi>] in the second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
they can find all set
Formes of Prayer, all composed
studyed Sermons, and all things
about Worship of mans invention
to be <hi>Images</hi> or Idolatry; and yet
they cannot find the abrogation of
the Jewish Sabbath in the express
words of <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 16. nor the other
Texts which I have cited; nor can
they find the Institution of the Lords
day in all the Texts and Evidences
produced for it. But though Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
may somewhat disturbe our
Concord and tempt some mens
Charity to remissness, by these dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,
he shall never keep them
out of Heaven, who worship God,
through Christ, by the Spirit, even
in spirit and truth: Nor, shall he,
I hope ever draw me, to think such
holy persons as herein differ from
me, to be worse than my self,
though I think them in this to be
<pb facs="tcp:59348:6"/>
unhappily mistaken: much less to
approve either of their own <hi>separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
from others, or of other mens
condemning them as Hereticks, and
inflicting severities upon them, for
these their opinions sake.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>hough the principal thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
by the Enquirers is, That I
would prove to them the Cessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Seventh-day Sabbath,
yet because they cast off the Lords
day, which I take to be a far
greater error and sin, than the observation of
both dayes; and because that when I have proved
the Institution of the Lords Day, I shall the more
easily take them off the other, by proving that
there are not two weekly dayes set apart by God
for holy Worship: Therefore I will begin with
the first Question, <hi>Whether the Lords day, or first
day of the week, be separated by Gods Institution
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59348:10"/>
for holy Worship, especially in publick Church-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions?</hi>
Aff.</p>
                     <p>And here for the right stating of the Question,
let it be noted, 1. That it is not the <hi>Name of a
Sabbath</hi> that we now meddle with, or stand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Let us agree in the <hi>Thing,</hi> and we shall ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
bear a difference about the name. Grant that
it is [<hi>A day separated by Gods Institution for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Assemblies and Worship</hi>] and then call it a
<hi>Sabbath</hi> or [<hi>the Lords day</hi>] as you please.
Though for my self, I add That [<hi>the Lords day</hi>]
is the name that the Holy Ghost hath set upon it,
and the name which the first Churches princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
used; and that they call it also sometimes
by the name of the <hi>Christian Sabbath;</hi> but that
is only Analogically, as it is resembled to the
<hi>Jewish Sabbath;</hi> and as they used the names
[<hi>Sacrifice</hi> and <hi>Altar</hi>]<note n="*" place="margin">I speak only <hi>de facto,</hi>
how the Antients used
these words.</note> at
the same time, for the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
Commemoration of
Christs Sacrifice in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of the Lords Supper, and for the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
or as Dr. <hi>Young</hi> saith, <hi>pag.</hi> 23. As in Scripture,
<hi>Baptism</hi> is called <hi>Circumcision.</hi> And that very
rarely too.</p>
                     <p>2. That the Question of the manner of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
the Lords day, and what exercises of
Worship it must be spent in, and what Diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are lawful or unlawful, as also when the day
beginneth, are not to be here medled with in the
beginning, but afterwards, when the Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of the Day it self is, first sufficiently
proved. Which is done as followeth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="3" facs="tcp:59348:10"/>
Arg. That day which was separated to holy
Worship by the Holy Ghost, was separated to holy
Worship by God the Father and the Son. But the
first day of the Week was separated to holy Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
by the Holy Ghost: Therefore the first day of
the Week was separated to holy Worship, by God
the Father and the Son.</p>
                     <p>The Minor only needeth proof among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</p>
                     <p>That day which was separated to holy Worship
by the Apostles, by the inspiration of the Holy
Ghost, was separated to holy Worship by the Holy
Ghost. But the first day of the Week was sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
to holy Worship by the Apostles by the inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Holy Ghost. Therefore the first day
of the Week was separated to holy Worship by the
Holy Ghost.</p>
                     <p>The Minor which only needeth proof, is thus
proved.</p>
                     <p>That day which was separated to holy Worship
by the Apostles who had the Holy Ghost promised
them by Christ, and given them, to lead them into
all truth, and to bring all his Doctrines to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,
and to teach the Churches to do all his
Commands, and to feed, and guide, and order them,
as his principal commissioned Church-Minister,
was separated to holy Worship by the Apostles by
the inspiration of the Holy Ghost.</p>
                     <p>But such is the first day of the Week:</p>
                     <p>Therefore the first day of the Week is separated
to holy Worship by the Apostles by the inspiration
of the Holy Ghost.</p>
                     <p>I have five Propositions now distinctly to
be proved: four for the proof of the Major,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59348:11"/>
and one for the proof of the Minor.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The first Proposition is,</hi> That Christ commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
his Apostles as his principal Church-Ministers,
to teach the Churches all his Doctrine, and deliver
them all his Commands and Orders, and so to settle
and guide the first Churches.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The second Proposition is,</hi> That Christ promised
them his Spirit, to enable them to do what he had
commissioned them to do, by leading them into all
truth, and bringing his words and deeds to their
remembrance, and by guiding them as his Churches
Guides.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The third Proposition is,</hi> That Christ performed
this promise, and gave his Spirit accordingly to his
Apostles, to enable them to all their commissioned
work.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The fourth Proposition is,</hi> That the Apostles
did actually separate or appoint the first day of the
Week, for holy Worship, especially in Church-as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The fifth Proposition is,</hi> That this act of theirs
was done by the Guidance or inspiration of the Holy
Ghost, which was given them.</p>
                     <p>And when I have distinctly proved these five
things, no sober understanding Christian can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that I should prove any more, towards the
proof of the Question in hand, Whether the first
day of the Week be separated by Gods Institution
for holy Worship, especially in Church-assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies?</p>

                     <head type="sub">Prop. I. That Christ Commissioned his Apostles, or
his principal Church-Ministers, to teach the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches

the first Churches.</head>
                     <p>This I prove, 1. By their Commission it self:
2. By their performance with its proper seal.
3. By the Consent of all the Christian world.</p>
                     <p>1. Luke 6. 13. He called to him his Disciples,
and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named
Apostles. <hi>Their first Commission is recited,</hi>
Matth. 10. <hi>at large.</hi>

                        <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 18, 19, 20. All Authority is given

the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost;
Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I
have commanded you. And, loe, I am with you
alway, even unto the end of the world; Amen.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>John</hi> 20. 21. Then said Jesus to them again,
Peace be unto you; As the Father hath sent me,
even so send I you: And when he had said this,
he breathed on them, and said, Receive ye the
Holy Ghost: Whosesoever sins ye remit, they are
remitted unto them, and whosesoever sins ye retain,
they are retained.</p>
                     <p>

the Gospel which was preached of me, is not after
man; For I neither received it of man, neither was
I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.</p>

                        <hi>John 21. 15, 16, 17. Simon</hi> Son of <hi>Jonas</hi> lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est

whom he had chosen; to whom also he presented
himself alive after his passion, by many infallible
proofs, being seen of them forty dayes, and speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     <p>They that will not take all this plain evidence
of Scripture for a proof of this first Proposition, I
suppose would not be ever the more moved by
it, if I should be so needlesly tedious, as to stay
to fetch Arguments from each Text.</p>
                     <p>2. The Apostles <hi>exercised</hi> such a power, as the
Proposition mentioneth, and God s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t to it, the
seal of Miracles. Therefore such a Power or
Office was given them by Christ.</p>
                     <p>The Consequence is undenyable. The Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
of this <hi>Enthimeme</hi> is so plainly expressed
in Scripture, that I am loth to take up much of
my own or the Readers time, in proving so
known a thing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="8" facs="tcp:59348:13"/>
They founded the Churches; they delivered
them the Doctrine and Commands of Christ;
they setled the Churches, as to Officers, Orders,
and Discipline, according to Christs Commands
and the Spirits determinations: Thus they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
the new Office of Deacons, and Deaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neffes
or Widows; and they ordained them El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in every Church, or City; and they deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
of Church Controversies; and gave the
Church Decrees; and delivered the Will of
Christ about the Sacrament, Church-Assemblies,
Prophecyings, <hi>&amp;c. Acts 2. &amp; 14. 23. Acts 6.
3, 4, &amp;c. 1 Tim. 3. Titus 1. Acts 15. 1 Cor. 11.
1 Cor. 14 &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. That all Christians (save Hereticks) did
acknowledge their power, and acquiesce in
their Decrees and Conduct, being a matter of
fact, needs no other proof, than the common
History of former Ages, and practice of this.
Which are so well known, that I will not injure
the Reader by proving it.</p>

                     <p>By these Texts it is most evident that Christ
promiseth the Apostles an extraordinary Spirit, or
measure of the Spirit, so to enable them to deliver
his Commands, and execute their Commission, as
that he will own what they do by the guidance
thereof; and the Churches may rest upon it as the
Infallible revelation of the Will of God.</p>

Prop. 1. <hi>Matter of past fact is to be known to
us by History</hi> (Written, Verbal or Practical.)</p>
                     <p>This is evident in the nature of the thing.
<hi>History</hi> is the Narration of <hi>facts</hi> that are past.
We speak not of the fact of meer <hi>natural agents,</hi>
but of <hi>Moral</hi> or <hi>humane</hi> facts. It may be known
without History what <hi>Eclipses</hi> there have been of
the <hi>Sun;</hi> what changes of the Moon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But
not what in particular <hi>Morals</hi> have been done
by man.</p>
                     <p>The necessity of <hi>other distinct</hi> wayes of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
are easily disproved. 1. It need not be
known by <hi>Divine supernatural Revelation.</hi> Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
no men could know what is past, but <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi>
or inspired persons: nor Prophets but in
few things: For it cannot be proved, that God
ever revealed to Prophets or inspired persons,
the general knowledge of things past; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
some <hi>particulars</hi> of special use (as the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
to <hi>Moses, &amp;c.</hi>) so that if Revelation by <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration,</hi>
Voice or Visions, were necessary, Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
it self could be understood by none but
inspired persons, or that had such revelation.</p>
                     <p>2. It is not known by <hi>Natural Causes,</hi> and by
arguing from the Natural Cause to the Effects.
It is no more possible to know all things <hi>past</hi>
this way, (by knowing the Causes) than all
things <hi>future.</hi> Therefore it must be ordinarily
known by <hi>Humane report,</hi> which we call <hi>History</hi>
or <hi>Tradition.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Prop. 2. <hi>Scripture History is not the only certain
History; much less the only credible.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Without Scripture History we may be certain,
that there was in 1666. a great Fire in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
                        <pb n="14" facs="tcp:59348:16"/>
and a great plague in 1665. and that there
were Wars in <hi>England, 1642, 1643, &amp;c.</hi> and that
there have been Parliaments in <hi>England</hi> which
have made the Statutes now in force; and that
there have been such Kings of <hi>England</hi> for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Ages, as our Records and Histories men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prop.</hi> 3. Scripture History is not the only cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
History of the things of the Ages in which it
was written, or of former Ages; much less the only
credible History of them.</p>
                     <p>We may know by other History certainly,
that there were such persons as <hi>Cyrus, Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
&amp;c.</hi> That the <hi>Macedonians</hi> had a large ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Empire; that the <hi>Romans</hi> after by many
Victories obtained a spacious Empire; that there
were such persons as <hi>Julius Caesar, Augustus, Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius,
Nero, Cicero, Virgil, Horace, Ovid,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prop.</hi> 4. Scripture History is not the only means
appointed by God, to help us to the knowledge of
Ecclesiastical matters of fact, transacted in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
times.</p>
                     <p>1. For if <hi>Humane History</hi> be <hi>certain</hi> or <hi>credible</hi>
in <hi>other cases,</hi> it is <hi>certain</hi> or <hi>credible in these.</hi>
There being no reason why <hi>these</hi> things, or <hi>much</hi>
of them, should not be as capable of a certain deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
to us by humane History as other matters.
As that there were Christians in those times, may
be known by what <hi>Tacitus, Suetonius, &amp;c.</hi> say.
And the antient Writers oft appeal in many
cases to the Heathens own History. And no
man pretendeth as to the Civil matters mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the Scriptures, that no other History of
the same is credible or certain. As of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59348:16"/>
of <hi>Augustus, Tiberius, Herod, Pilate,
Foelix, Festus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>2. There are other certain means known to
us; of which I must refer the Reader to what I
have written in my Reasons of the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<hi>Part 2. Cap.</hi> 7. specially <hi>pag.</hi> 335. to 340.</p>
                     <p>3. No man can doubt but that the Christians
of that same age, (as till the year one hundred)
might easily and certainly know such a matter
of publick fact, as whether the <hi>Lords day</hi> was
constantly set apart and observed by all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Churches for holy Worship: For 1. It is
certain that they did know it by <hi>sight and
sense,</hi> and therefore had no need of <hi>History.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. It is certain that they knew it <hi>before the
Scriptures were written,</hi> which we now speak of:
For it is not possible that for all those years
time before any of the New Testament was
written, the Christians who assembled to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
God, should not know on what day they
used to assemble.</p>
                     <p>And if they knew it in the year 100. they
must needs know it as well in the year 101. &amp;
102. <hi>&amp;</hi> 103. and so on. For those that were
young Christians fifty years after Christ, would
be aged at an hundred: And those that were young
at an hundred, would be aged at an hundred and
fifty, and so on. So that an age of people, not
ending at the age of a single person, Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and societies are like Rivers, that keep the
same channel, and name, while one part of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
followeth another. Nay, some of the <hi>same
men</hi> are there <hi>anno</hi> 100. who were there <hi>anno</hi> 50.
some <hi>anno</hi> 150. who were there <hi>anno</hi> 100. and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59348:17"/>
so on. Ten thousand thousand men, women
and children, can tell on what day the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
of <hi>England</hi> use to assemble; whereas if
an <hi>Apostle</hi> were among us, and should <hi>write</hi> on
what day we assemble; fewer would know it
by that means; And they that knew it but by
his <hi>writing,</hi> would know it <hi>less confidently,</hi> than
they that knew it by <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>experience.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet, forget not, that I am far from ascribing
a certainty or a credibility to <hi>all</hi> humane Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
Much more from equalling any with the
credit of Divine History. But only I say, 1. That
<hi>sense</hi> is more assuring, as to the <hi>subject,</hi> than any
History whatever: 2. And that some History be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
Divine is certain: 3. And that much Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
is credible: 4. And that this instance of the
Day on which all Churches in the world as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
for holy Worship, is one of the most
palpable for certainty that possibly could be
imagined.</p>
                     <p>4. And I add, that if <hi>some</hi> humane History or
Tradition be not certain, there can be no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of much of the <hi>Divine History,</hi> to any but
the persons who were themselves <hi>inspired,</hi> or that
<hi>saw the Visions,</hi> or <hi>Miracles</hi> that confirmed them.
For as <hi>internal sense</hi> or <hi>intuition</hi> must assure the
<hi>Inspired</hi> persons themselves, and <hi>external sense</hi>
must assure those that <hi>saw the matters of fact;</hi> so
all the rest have no way to know them, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
still by a succession of <hi>New Revelations</hi> from
Heaven, (which God doth not give) or else
by <hi>Report.</hi> And I can no otherwise know what
was revealed to an Apostle, nor what was done in
those times: (Of which more anon.)</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="17" facs="tcp:59348:17"/>
                        <hi>Prop.</hi> 5. The first institution of Church Offices,
<hi>and</hi> Orders, and so of the Lords day, was not by
Scripture.</p>
                     <p>The proof is undeniable: Because the Old
<hi>Testament</hi> did not contain the Institution, (<hi>e. g.</hi>
of <hi>particular Churches, Sacraments, Presbyters,
Deacons, Deaconesses, and the Lords day,</hi> &amp;c.) And
the <hi>New Testament</hi> was none of it written till
<hi>anno</hi> 40. at soonest when some (as <hi>Bucholtzer,
Bellarm,</hi> &amp;c.) think <hi>Matthews</hi> Gospel was written,
though others say many years after,) and it was
not <hi>all written</hi> till <hi>ann.</hi> 99. Now it is certain that
the Church was not all these years without the
<hi>Orders</hi> now in question, nor without <hi>a day</hi> to
meet on for publick Worship. Even as <hi>Baptism</hi>
and the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> were instituted by Christ
himself, long before the writing of any part of
the New Testament, and the Church was in long
possession of them, upon the bare verbal declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Apostles.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prop.</hi> 6. Therefore it is certain that no part of
the New Testament was written to any such end as
to institute Sacraments, or Church Offices, or stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Orders; but to instruct men about those that
were already instituted, (<hi>as</hi> to <hi>the use of</hi> those
times.)</p>
                     <p>For it could not be written to institute that
which was instituted before, so many years.</p>
                     <p>Prop. 7. <hi>No part of the New Testament was
written to make known to the Churches of those
times, the said Sacraments, Offices, stated Orders,</hi>
and <hi>Time</hi> of <hi>Worship;</hi> (Still observe that by a
<hi>part</hi> I mean any <hi>book;</hi> And I except the <hi>Decree,</hi>
written in a Letter of the Apostles, Elders and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59348:18"/>
Brethren, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. concerning Circumcision, not
to be imposed on the Gentiles; which yet made
no new institution, nor declared any, but only
determined of the continued forbearance of
some things forbidden before of God, in the
precepts called <hi>Noah</hi>'s; and <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles, which
reduce the Churches to Orders before setled, and
urge them to duty, and decide some doubts about
particular cases of Conscience.)</p>
                     <p>The proof is visible, 1. In the Writings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
2. In that all the Churches were in the
possession and use of all the things in question,
long before: (For <hi>mutable Orders</hi> and <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi>
are none of the things in question.) It
would be vain to write a history now, to tell
English men of this present age, that the Lords
day is used in <hi>England</hi> as a day set apart for
publike worship; or that persons are Baptized,
or receive the Lords Supper in <hi>England.</hi> For
seeing it is the common usage of all the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
almost of the Land, it is needless to tell men
among us by writing that it is so (unless it be to
inferr somewhat else from it.)</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prop.</hi> 8. Yet those holy Scriptures which were
written to men of those times, were also intended
for the instruction of all succeeding ages; And so
the foure Evangelists wrote the history of Christ,
<hi>and Luke</hi> wrote the history of <hi>Paul</hi> till his coming
to <hi>Rome</hi> and longer, and of some more of the
Apostles; And on the by, in the Epistles extant, the
Churches Customes of those times are much intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
And all this together with the subordinate
history and the universal tenure and practice of the
Churches, is that history by which we must know
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59348:18"/>
the matters of fact of those times; <hi>Nor is there
any room left for a rational pretense of</hi> Rome <hi>or
any other Church, to produce Divine Institutions,
which were committed</hi> only to them, <hi>or entrusted
to</hi> their particular keeping <hi>only, and were not
delivered in</hi> Scripture, <hi>nor in</hi> Common <hi>to the</hi> whole
Church.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prop.</hi> 9. Thus according to the use of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of the New Testament, the matter of fact in
question (<hi>of the</hi> Lords dayes separation) is histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
touched on, and proved; though but briefly
and on the by, as a thing as well known to the Church
before, as what day goeth over their head.</p>
                     <p>The Historical hints of the New Testament
must be taken together, and not a part only; that
they may prove a usage.</p>
                     <p>And, 1. That <hi>Christ rose</hi> on that day is past

Beza hath given them Reason enough

Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> well noteth that it plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth
to the Christian assemblies, to which they
were not to come empty, but to deposite what
they brought into the treasury of the Church;
or if it were in their <hi>private repositories,</hi> it doth
not much difference the case. <hi>Calvins</hi> excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
against <hi>Chrysostome</hi> here is groundless, as the
reasons before evince. So that by this Text the
custome of holding Church meetings on the
Lords day, as a peculiar day, is intimated,
though but on the by, as most Expositors
agree.</p>
                     <p>And the denomination of the <hi>Lords day,</hi> Joh.
1. 10. being the same which the Christian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
ever used of the First day, puts it yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
out of doubt. As for his conjecture who

day of Christs Resurrection, when as the
constant use of the name by all the Churches,
sheweth that it was taken ever since for the
<hi>weekly</hi> day, it deserveth no other refutation.</p>
                     <p>Now though all this set together shew that
Scripture is not silent of the matter of fact; yet it
is the full and unquestionable expository evidence
of the practice of all Churches in the world, since
the very daies of the Apostles, which beyond all
doubt assureth us that <hi>de facto</hi> the Lords day
was by the Apostles separated for holy Worship,
especially in publick Church-assemblies. But
these several intimations being seconded with so
full an Exposition, tell us that the Scripture is
not silent in the case, nor doth pass it by.
I was loth to name the day of the sending down
of the Holy Ghost as a proof: Because that some
do controvert it. But it seemeth to me a very
considerable thing. 1. That the day (that year)
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap> of Pentecost on which the
Holy Ghost was given, was indeed the first day
of the week, even Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> granteth without
any question or stop. And the Churches obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of <hi>Whitsunday</hi> as the day, and that so
very early as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and many others say,
from the Apostles, doth seem a very credible
history or tradition of it. 2. Its agreed on that
the Passoever that year fell on the Sabboth day,
and that Pentecost was fifty daies after the Passo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:
which falleth out on the Lords day. And <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
noteth from <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 1. that it was the day
that the Law was given on, and so on which the
Spirit was given for the new Law. 3. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
that this great gift of the Holy Ghost
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59348:20"/>
which was to make the Apostles Infallible, and
to enable them for their commission-work, and
bring all Christs Doctrines and Commands to
their remembrance, was so memorable a thing,
that it was as it were the <hi>Beginning</hi> of the <hi>full
Gospel-state</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Christ,
(which through all Christs abode on Earth, was
as the <hi>Infant, existent</hi> indeed but in the <hi>womb,</hi>
and on this day was as it were <hi>Born</hi> before the
world, and brought into the open light;) the
<hi>Lords day</hi> also seemeth to me to be as it were
<hi>Conceived</hi> on the <hi>day of Christs Resurrection,</hi> but
<hi>Born</hi> on this day of the Holy Ghosts descent.</p>
                     <p>But Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> hath one poor reason against
it, viz. <hi>Because it was but an accidental thing that
the day fell out that year on the first day.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Was it not according to the course
of Nature? How then can that be called Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental?
2. But however it was no contingent
accidental thing (in his sense) that the <hi>Holy
Ghost was sent down on that day</hi> rather than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
If a sparrow fall not to the ground with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

about the other Texts forecited. Note only,
1. That as to his exception about Christs travel
on his Resurrection day, I have after answered
it. 2. That he freely granteth that <gap reason="foreign">

citeth afterward many testimonies that oblations
and contributions were in the Churches a usual
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59348:20"/>
Lords dayes work. 4. That he confesseth that
<hi>Rev.</hi> 10. 1. is meant of the Lords day, as by that
time grown into reputation. 5. That he think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it was in small reputation before, because
<hi>Paul</hi> chose the Sabbath so often to Preach on,
to the Jews and Hellenists, or Greeks: whereas
he himself is forced to confess that it was not
for the <hi>days</hi> sake, but the <hi>Assemblies,</hi> to do
them good. 6. That he vainly conceiteth
[that Because the Lords day was kept on the
account of <hi>Christs Resurrection,</hi>] it implyeth
that it was not kept by <hi>Gods command,</hi> which
needeth no confutation. 7. That his labour to
prove that <hi>Paul</hi> meant the Jewish Sabbath as
abrogated is vain; for we deny it not. 8. That
he cannot deny that Christians had all that time
of the Apostles a <hi>stated day</hi> (as <hi>Pliny</hi> himself
witnesseth) for solemn worship, above other
daies. 9. That he vainly snatcheth a little coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
from <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> &amp;c. when as no
man since <hi>Cochlaeus</hi> writeth more detestably of
them. 10. That after he confesseth that [<hi>its no
doubt</hi> but the <hi>Religious observation of the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
in the Apostles age with their approbation</hi> and
Authority, <hi>and hath since continued in the same
respect.</hi>] And what needs he more for confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
                     <p>And as to his allegations of the Judgement of
the Reformed, Lutheran and Roman Church,
1. We take none of them for our Rule (so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
are we) But, 2. He himself citeth <hi>Beza,
Mercer, Paraeus, Cuchlinus, Simler, Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,
Zanchius, &amp;c.</hi> as holding that <hi>It was, an
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59348:21"/>
Apostolical and Truly Divine Tradition, that the
Apostles turned the Sabbath into the Lords day,
that it was an Apostolical custome, or a custome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in the Apostles times, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And whereas afterward he would perswade us
that they spent but a little of the day in holy
worship, he himself cited Mr. <hi>George Sandys</hi> Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels;
saying of the Copties, that [<hi>On Saturday
presently after midnight, they repair unto their
Churches, where they remain well nigh till</hi> Sunday
<hi>at noon</hi> (of the Evening he speaketh not, but of
their first meeting) <hi>during which time they neither
sit nor kneel, but support themselves on Crutches;
And they sing over the most part of</hi> Davids <hi>Psalms
at every meeting with divers parcels of the New
Testament</hi>] (This is like the old way; And such
a Liturgie we do not contradict nor scruple.)</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sandys </hi>also informeth us of the<hi> Armenian</hi>Christians that<hi> coming into the place of the Assembly
on </hi>Sunday<hi> in the afternoon </hi>(no doubt they had
been there in the Morning) <hi>be found one sitting in
the midst of the Congregation, in habit not differing
from the rest, reading on a Bible in the Chaldaean
tongue: That anon after, came the Bishop in a hood
or Vest of black, with a staffe in his hand? That
first he prayed, and then sung certain Psalms as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
by two or three. After all of them singing
joyntly, at interims praying to themselves, the Bishop
all this while with his bands erected and his face to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Altar; That Service being ended, they
all kissed his hand, and bestowed their Almes, he
laying his other hand on their heads, and blessing
them, </hi>&amp;c.</p>

                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:59348:21"/>
And of the Abaffines he reciteth out of <hi>Brier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi>
(and he from <hi>Damianus</hi> a Goes) that they
honour the Lords day as the <hi>Christian Sabbath,</hi>
and the <hi>Saturday</hi> as the Jews Sabbath, because
they receive the Canons called the Apostles which
speak for both.</p>
                     <p>And King <hi>Edgar</hi> in <hi>England</hi> ordained that the
Sabbath should begin ou <hi>Saturday</hi> at three a Clock
Afternoon, and continue till break a Day on
<hi>Munday.</hi> These Laws for the Sabbath of <hi>Alfred,
Edgar, &amp;c.</hi> were confirmed by <hi>Etheldred,</hi> and
more fully by <hi>Canutus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But of these things I shall say more anon
under the Proposition following; In the mean
time only remembring you, 1. That it is well that
we are required after the fourth Commandment
to pray [<hi>Lord have Mercy upon us, and encline
our hearts to keep this Law</hi>] And we accept
his Concession, that this includeth all of that
Commandment which is the Law of Nature
(Though I have told you that it reacheth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
further.) 2. That we approve of the
plain Doctrine of the English Homilies on this
point, and stand to the Exposition of sober im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prop.</hi> 10. It hath been the constant practice of
all Christs Churches in the whole world, ever since
the daies of the Apostles to this day, to assemble for
publick worship on the Lords day, as a day set apart
thereunts by the Apostles. Yea so universal was
this judgement <hi>and</hi> practice, that there is no one
Church, <hi>no one</hi> writer, or one heretick (<hi>that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
to have read of</hi>) that can be proved ever to
have dissented or gainsaid it, till of late times.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:59348:22"/>
The proof of this is needless to any one that
is versed in the writings of the ancients; And
others cannot try what we shall produce. I
have been these ten years separated from my Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary,
and am therefore less furnished for this
task than is requisite: But I will desire no man
to receive more, than the Testimonies produced
by Dr. <hi>Pet. Heylin</hi> himself, which with pittiful
weakness he would pervert. And he being the
Grand Adversary with whom I do now contend,
I shall only premise these few Observations, as
sufficient to confute all his Cavils and Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
                     <p>1. When his great work is to prove that the
Lords day was not called the <hi>Sabbath</hi> (unless by
allusion) we grant it him (as to a Jewish Sabbath)
as nothing to the purpose.</p>
                     <p>2. Whereas he strenuously proveth that the
Lords day was not taken for a <hi>Sabbath de re,</hi> we
grant it him also, taking the word in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Jewish sense.</p>
                     <p>3. When he laboureth to prove that Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
met on other daies of the week besides the
Lords day (though not for the Lords Supper)
we grant it him as nothing to the purpose. So
<hi>Calvin</hi> Preached or Lectured daily at <hi>Geneva,</hi> and
yet kept not every day as a holy day separated
to Gods worship, as they did the Lords day,
though too remisly. So we do still keep Week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
Lectures, and the Church of <hi>England</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
the Reading of Common Prayer on
<hi>Wednesdayes</hi> and <hi>Fridays,</hi> and holy day Evens;
Do they therefore keep them Holy as the Lords
day?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="27" facs="tcp:59348:22"/>
4. When he tells us that <hi>Clemens Alexandri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
and <hi>Origen,</hi> plead against them that would
hear and pray on that day only, we grant it him;
and we are ready to say as they do, that we should
not confine Gods Service to one day only, as if
we might be profane and worldly on all other
daies; but should take all fit opportunities for
religious helps, and should all the week keep our
minds as near as we can in a holy frame and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
Of the rest of his Objections I shall say
more in due place.</p>
                     <p>5. But I must note in the beginning that he
granteth the main cause which I plead for, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging,
<hi>Hist. Sab. l. 2. page</hi> 30. it thus;
<q>[<hi>So that the Religious observation of this day,
beginning in the age of the Apostles, no doubt but
with their Approbation and Authority, and since
continuing in the same respect for so many
ages, may be very well accounted amongst
those Apostolical Traditions, which have been
universally received in the Church of God.</hi>]</q> And
what need we more than the <hi>Religious</hi> Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>in the Apostles time,</hi> by the <hi>Apostles Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
and <hi>Authority, and this delivered to us by the
universal Church, as an Apostolical Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But yet he saith that the Apostles made it not
a <hi>Sabbath. Answ.</hi> Give us the <hi>Religious observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and call it by what name you please. We
are not fond of the name of the Sabbath.</p>
                     <p>6 And therefore we grant all that he labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
proveth of the abolition of the Jewish Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
and that the Ancients commonly consent,
that by the abolished Sabbath, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 16. is
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59348:23"/>
meant inclusively the weekly Jewish Sabbath:
<hi>Epiphan. l. 1. haeres. 33. n. 11. Ambros. in loc.
Hieron. Epist. ad Algus. qu. 10. Chrysost. Hom. 13. in
Haebr. 7. August. cont. Jud. cap. 2. &amp; cont. Faust.
Manich. l. 16. c.</hi> 28. I recite the places for them
that doubt of it.</p>
                     <p>Now let us peruse the particular Testimonies.</p>
                     <p>1. I begin with <hi>Ignatius,</hi> (though <hi>Dallaeus</hi>
have said so much to prove the best Copy of him
of latter date and spurious; because others think
otherwise, and that Copy is by him thought to
be written <hi>Cent.</hi> 3.) who saith [<hi>Let us not keep
the Sabbath in a Jewish manner in sloth and
idleness, but after a spiritual manner; not in bodily
ease, but in the study of the Law; not eating
meat drest yesterday, or drinking warm drinks, and
walking out a limited space, but in the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the works of God—And after the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
let every one that loveth Christ keep the Lords
day Festival, the Resurrection day,</hi> the <hi>Queen</hi> and
<hi>Empress of all daies, in which our life was raised
again,</hi> and <hi>death was overcome by our Lord and
Saviour.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>Either these <hi>Epist.</hi> of <hi>Ignatius</hi> (ad <hi>Philip. &amp;c.</hi>)
are genuine or spurious. If genuine, than note
how clearly it is asserted that the Lords day was
to be observed as the Queen of all daies, by all
that were lovers of Christ. And that the seventh
day Sabbath was kept with it then and there
(in <hi>Asia</hi> so near the Apostles daies) no wonder;
when it was but the honourable, gradual, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
from the Mosaical Ceremonies, with an
avoiding the scandalous hinderance of the Jews
Conversion. And Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> well noteth, that it was
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59348:23"/>
only the Eastern Churches next the Jews that for
a time kept both daies, but not the Western, who
rather turned the Sabbath to a fast.</p>
                     <p>But if <hi>Ignatius Ep.</hi> be spurious written <hi>Cent.</hi> 3.
then as <hi>Dallaeus</hi> would prove, they were written
by some heretical or heterodox person; And so
it will be no wonder that holy dayes are pleaded
for, when (as Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> observeth) <hi>Cerinthus</hi>
and his followers in the Apostles times, stood up
for the Jewish Sabbath and Ceremonies, and so
were for both daies: But it will be our Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
that even the Hereticks held with the
universal Church for the Lords day.</p>
                     <p>2. The great Controversie about the Day of
<hi>Easter,</hi> which spread so early through all the
Churches is a full Confirmation of our matter of
<hi>fact.</hi> For when the Western Churches were for
the <hi>Passover day</hi> (the better to content the Jews
saith <hi>Heylin</hi>) the Eastern thought it intollerable
that it should not be kept on a <hi>Lords</hi> day, because
that was the weekly day observed on the same
account of the Resurrection: The Eastern Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
never questioned their supposition of the
<hi>Lords day;</hi> And the Western (after <hi>Victors</hi> rash
excommunicating the <hi>Asian</hi> Bishops) never rested
till they brought them to keep it on the Lords
day: <hi>Pius, Anicetus, Victor,</hi> &amp;c. prosecuting the
cause.</p>
                     <p>3. The Book (though perished) which <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lito
wrote of the Lords day, Euseb. l. 4. c.</hi> 25. by
the title may be well supposed to confirm at least
the matter of fact or usage.</p>
                     <p>4. All those little Councils, mentioned by
<hi>Heylin, p.</hi> 48. held at <hi>Osroena, Corinth,</hi> in <hi>Gaul,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59348:24"/>
in Pontus,</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi> prove this, <hi>The Canons of them
all,</hi> saith <hi>Heylin, being extant in</hi> Eusebius'<hi>s time,
and in all which it was concluded for the Sunday.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But saith <hi>Heylin</hi> by this [<hi>You see that the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
and the Sabbath were long in striving for the
Victory] p. 49. Answ.</hi> I see that some men can
out-face the clearest light. Here was no striving
at all which day should be the weekly day set
apart for holy worship, but only whether <hi>Easter</hi>
should follow the time of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
to the Lords day.</p>
                     <p>5. <hi>Justin Martyrs</hi> Testimony is so express and
so commonly cited, that I need not recite the

                     <p>Now 1. Here being mention of no other day,
no man can question but that this day was set
apart for these holy assemblies in a peculiar
manner as the other week dayes were not.
2. This being the writing of one of the most

as much credit as any Christian History
or Writing since the Apostles can deserve. Nor
hath <hi>Heylin</hi> any thing to say against it.</p>
                     <p>6. The next remembred by <hi>Heylin</hi> is <hi>Dionysius

                     <p>7. The next is <hi>Clemens Alexander.</hi> who expresly
asserteth the matter of fact, that the Lords day
was then kept by Christians. Yea, <hi>Heylin</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rideth
him for fetching it as far as <hi>Plato Strom.
l.</hi> 7. But <hi>Heylin</hi> thinks he was against keeping
any dayes: But he that will examine his words
shall find, that he speaketh only against them
that would be Ceremonious observers of the day,
more than of the work of the day, and would
be religious on that day alone. And therefore
he saith, that [<hi>He that leadeth his life according
to the Ordinances of the Gospel doth keep the Lords
Day, when he casteth away every evil thought,
and doing things with knowledge and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
doth glorifie the Lord in his Resurrection.</hi>]
This is not to speak against the Day, but to
shew how it ought to be sincerely kept. But if
he had been against it, its all one to my cause,
who only prove that <hi>de facto all Christian Churches
kept it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. The next witness is <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who oft as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serteth
this to be the holy day of the Christians
Church-Assemblies, and holy Worship: His te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
in <hi>Apolog. cap.</hi> 16. is so commonly known
that I need not recite it. It is the same in sense
with <hi>Justin Martyrs,</hi> and written in an Apology
for the Christians, purposely describing their
custom of meeting and worshipping on the <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
(as he calls it there) as <hi>Justin</hi> did. And
that it was not an hours work only, he shews in
saying, that <hi>The day was kept as a day of rejoicing,</hi>
                        <pb n="32" facs="tcp:59348:25"/>
and then describeth the work. And <hi>de Idolol.
c.</hi> 14. he saith, that <hi>every eighth day</hi> was the
Christians festival. And <hi>de Coron. Mil. c.</hi> 3. and
oft he calleth it the Lords day, and saith it
was a crime to fast upon it. And the work of
the day described by <hi>Justin,</hi> and by him <hi>Apolog.
c.</hi> 39. is just the same that we desire now the
day to be spent in: we plead for no other.</p>
                     <p>But most grosly saith <hi>Heylin,</hi> pag. 55. [<hi>But
sure it is that their assemblies held no longer than
our Morning Service; that they met only before noon;
for</hi> Justin <hi>saith, that when they met they used to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Sacrament, and that the service being
done, every man went again to his daily labours.</hi>]
<hi>Answ.</hi> Is this a proof to conclude a [<hi>Certainty</hi>]
from? Most certainly abundance of testimonies
might be produced to prove that they came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
early in the Morning, and stayed till Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
if not till within Night. The former
<hi>Pliny</hi> and many others witness: And the later
many accusations of the Heathens, that censured
them for night-crimes at their meetings: And
all that report it almost, tell us of the Sacrament
administred, and <hi>Tertullian</hi> and others, of their
feasting together (their Love Feasts) as a <hi>Supper</hi>
before they parted: Now let but the time be
measured by the work: By that time the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
of the Old Testament and New were
read, and all the prayers then made, and all the
Preaching and Exhortations, and then all the
Prayers and Praises at the Celebration of the
Lords Supper (especially if they were half as
long as the Liturgies ascribed to <hi>Basil, Chrysostom,</hi>
and the rest in the <hi>Biblioth. Patrum</hi>) and by
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59348:25"/>
that time the Sacrament it self was administred,
with all the action and singing of Psalms, and
all the Oblations and Collections made; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
this, all the Church Discipline on parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
persons exercised, where Questions and
Answers and Proofs must take up a great deal
of time, sure one day would be at an end, or
very near it. And after when the Love Feasts
were left off, and the Church met twice, and
made an intermission, they did as we do now.
And the very Custom of Preaching all the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>Audientes</hi> and <hi>Catechumens,</hi> till al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Noon, when they were dismist with a <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa
est,</hi> and spending the rest of the day in
Teaching the Church, and Celebrating the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
with all the larger Eucharistical acts,
do fully shew how the day was spent: Which
I would quickly prove by particular Testimonies,
but that I am separated from my Library; and
Dr. <hi>Young</hi> hath fully done it to my hand. The
very Context of these testimonies, with what
<hi>Albaspinaeus</hi> hath of their Catechizing and
Church order will soon satisfie the impartial
searcher.</p>
                     <p>As for what he saith out of <hi>Justin,</hi> of <hi>returning to
their labours,</hi> I can find no such word in him; nor
do I believe there is any such to be found, unless
of returning to their six dayes weekly labour,
when the Religious work was ended with the
day: And I imagine the Reader will find no
more, if so much.</p>
                     <p>9. The next proof is universal, even the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of all the Christian Churches without one
contradicting Vote that ever I read of, that the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59348:26"/>
Lords dayes worship was to be performed <hi>stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
and that it was not allowed them to pray or
worship kneeling, upon any Lords day in the
year (or any week day between <hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sontide</hi>):
And the difficulty of these stations is
expressed (see <hi>Albaspinaeus</hi> of it) which sheweth
that it was for a long time. Whatever they did
in Hearing (its like they sate, for <hi>Justin</hi> saith,
We rise to pray) but it is certain they stood in
<hi>worshipping acts,</hi> as <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>praise.</hi> This
<hi>Justin Martyr</hi> hath before mentioned: <hi>Tertullian</hi>
hath it expresly, and <hi>Heylin</hi> himself citeth him
<hi>de Coron. Mil. &amp; Basil l. de Spir. S. c. 27. &amp; Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eron.
advers. Luciferian. August. Epist. 118. Hilar.
Praef. in Psal. Ambros. Serm.</hi> 62. To which he
may add <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and divers Councils, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<hi>Nic. 1. &amp; Trul.</hi> of which after. (I once
pleaded this ancient custom with them that
would have all excluded from the Sacrament
that kneel not, to prove that kneeling at the
Sacrament on the Lords dayes could not be in
the Church of many hundred years after the
Apostles, when the universal Church condemned
kneeling on all Lords dayes worship.) And
Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> himself saith [<hi>What time this custom
was laid by I can hardly say; but sure I am, it
was not laid aside in a long time after; not till the
time of Pope</hi> Alexander <hi>the third, who lived about
the year 1160. &amp;c.]</hi> Now from all this it is most
evident that the Lords day was then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</p>
                     <p>10. In this place though by anticipation I add
the two General Councils now named: The first
great General Council at <hi>Nice, Can.</hi> 20. which
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59348:26"/>
reneweth and confirmeth this antient custom of
not kneeling in prayer on the Lords dayes, that
there might be an uniformity kept in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.

again; which proveth what we seek, the matter
of fact of the dayes general observation.</p>
                     <p>11. The next is <hi>Origen,</hi> who is not denyed
to witness to the matter of fact; but <hi>Heylin</hi>
thinks he was against the <hi>Right</hi> of it: But his
mistake is the same, as about <hi>Clemens Alex. Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi>
did but desire that other dayes might be kept
also as profitably as they could; as our Lecture
dayes are.</p>
                     <p>12. <hi>Cyprian</hi> is the next, whose testimonies for
matter of fact are full, and <hi>Heylin</hi> hath nothing
to say against him, but that it is his private opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that the Lords day was prefigured in the
eighth day destined to Circumcision. Which is
nothing at all to our business in hand.</p>
                     <p>13. And he himself cites Pope <hi>Fabians</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretal
<hi>Anno</hi> 237. (a testimony therefore that he
is not to refuse) [<hi>for every man and woman</hi> on the
Lords dayes <hi>to bring a quantity of bread and
wine to be first offered on the Altar, and then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed
in the Sacrament</hi>]</p>
                     <p>The Canon of <hi>Clem.</hi> before mentioned I now
pretermit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But saith Dr.</hi> Heylin 1. All days between <hi>Easter</hi>
and <hi>Whitsunday</hi> had adoration by genuflection also
prohibited on them. 2. And the Church had other
Festivals also.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The Reason of Station was to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
Christs Resurrection and ours: Therefore it
continued for these dayes: But that was for the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59348:27"/>
short occasional meetings of those dayes, which
he himself will not say were separated to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
2. And the other Festivals of the Church
make nothing against us: For 1. Some of them
(as <hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Whitsunday</hi>) were but the same
Lords day. 2. And some of them were but An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversary,
and not weekly Holy dayes; as the
Nativity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. And he confesseth even these
were brought in long after the Apostles dayes,
and therefore can lay no claim to Apostolical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.
<hi>Pag.</hi> 62. he himself saith, that [<hi>The
Feast of Christs Nativity was ordained or instituted
in the second Century, and that of his Incarnation
in the third.</hi>] And besides <hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Whitsun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
(which are the Lords day) <hi>Christmas</hi> is all
that he nameth out of <hi>Beda</hi> (so long after) as
the <hi>Majora Solennia.</hi> The Eves were but hours
for preparation.</p>
                     <p>14. To these (though in the fourth Century)
I may add <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> who recordeth the Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(and Adoration to the East) on the Lords
dayes as those Traditions received by the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Church.</p>
                     <p>And here I would have it specially noted, that
when <hi>Tertullian, Epiphanius</hi> and others note <hi>stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the Lords dayes to be an unwritten Tradition
received by the whole Church,</hi> they do not say the
same of the <hi>Lords day it self,</hi> (though the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients
oft say, that we <hi>received it from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles:</hi>)
Now by this it is plain, that they took
the Lords day to be of Apostolick Institution
past all question, and the unwritten <hi>Vniversal
Traditions</hi> to be somewhat <hi>lower</hi> (which there
was no Scripture for at all.) (Among which the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59348:27"/>
white Garment, and the Milk and Honey to the
Baptized, and the Adoration toward the East
are numbred.) For he that is appointed to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
on the Lords dayes <hi>standing,</hi> or toward the
<hi>East,</hi> is supposed to know that on that day he is
to worship. If the Mode on that <hi>day</hi> be of
Universal Tradition as a Ceremony, the day is
supposed to be somewhat more than of unwritten
Tradition.</p>
                     <p>15. I add here also (though in the fourth
Century, because it looks back to the Institution)
the words of <hi>Athanasius</hi> cited by <hi>Heylin</hi> himself,
<hi>Homil. de Semente</hi> (though <hi>Nannius</hi> question it)
[<hi>That our Lord transferred the Sabbath to the
Lords day.</hi>] But saith Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> [<hi>This must be
understood, not as if done by his Commandment, but
on his occasion: the Resurrection of our Lord on
that day, being the principal Motive which did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
his Church to make choice thereof for the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies—For
otherwise it would cross what
formerly had been said by</hi> Athanasius <hi>in his
<gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, &amp;c.</hi>] <hi>Answ.</hi> It expresseth the common
judgement of the Church, that Christ himself
made the Change by these degrees: 1. Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally
and as an Exemplar by his own Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
on that day; giving the first cause of it,
as the Creation-rest did of the seventh day:
2. Secretly commanding it to his Apostles.
3. Commissioning them to promulgate all his
Commands. 4. Sending down the Spirit on that
very day. 5. And by that Spirit determining
them by promulgation to determine publickly of
the day, and settle all the Churches in long
possession of it before their death. That which
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59348:28"/>
is thus done, may well be said to be done by
Christ, 2. And what shew of Contradiction
hath his <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> to this? [<hi>It was commanded at
first that the Sabbath day should be observed in
memory of the accomplishment of the World: so do
we celebrate the Lords day as a Memorial of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of a new Creation.</hi>] Had not he a Creating
head here that out of these words could gather,
that we celebrate the Lords day <hi>without a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
Voluntarily?</hi> One would think [so] should
signifie the contrary.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>ib. pag.</hi> 8. he citeth <hi>Socrates</hi> for the same,
saying that [<hi>The designe of the Apostles was not
to busie themselves in prescribing festival daies, but
to instruct the people in the wayes of Godliness.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ. Socrates</hi> plainly rebuketh the busie
Ceremonious arrogancy of after Ages, for making
new holy dayes; and doth not at all mean the
Lords day; but saith that to make <hi>festivals,</hi> that
is, other and more, as since they did, was none of
the Apostles business. Nor is this any thing at all
to the matter of fact, which none denyed.</p>
                     <p>16. I will add that as another Testimony
which <hi>p.</hi> 9. he citeth against it. The Council at
<hi>Paris, An. 829. c.</hi> 50. which as he speaketh
ascribeth the keeping of the Lords day to
<hi>Apostolical Tradition, confirmed by the Authority of
the Church:</hi> The words are [<hi>ut creditur Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum
traditione, immo Ecclesiae authoritate descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du,</hi>
&amp;c.] Now I have proved that if the Apostles
did it, they did it by the Holy Ghost, and by
Authority from Christ,</p>
                     <p>But he citeth <hi>p.</hi> 7, 8. the words of <hi>Athanasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
Maximus Taurinensis</hi> and <hi>Augustine,</hi> saying
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59348:28"/>
that [<hi>We honour the Lords day for the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
and because Christ rose, and</hi> (Aug.) <hi>The
Lords day was declared to Christians by the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of our Lord, and from that</hi> (or <hi>from him</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
<hi>began to have its festivity</hi>] From whence
he gathereth that it was only done by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Church and not by any precept of our
Saviour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> As if Christs Resurrection could not
be the fundamental occasion, and yet Christs
Law the obliging cause? Would any else have
thus argued, [<hi>The Jews observed the seventh day
Sabbath, because the Creator rested the seventh
day: Therefore they had no command from God for
it?</hi>] Woe to the Churches that have such exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of Gods commands! Or as if Christ who
both Commissioned and Inspired the Apostles by
the Holy Ghost, to teach all his commands, and
settle Church Orders, were not thus the chief Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of what they did by his <hi>Commission</hi> and <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:</hi>
What <hi>Church</hi> can shew the like Commission
or the like Miraculous and Infallible Spirit as
they had?</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>But, <hi>saith he,</hi> Christ and two of his Disciples
travelled on the day of his Resurrection from <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi>
to <hi>Emaus,</hi> seven miles, and back again,
which they would not have done if it had been a
Sabbath.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. They would not have done it if it
had been a Jewish Sabbath of Ceremonial Rest;
But those that you count too precise will go as
far now in Case of need to hear a Sermon: And
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59348:29"/>
remember that they spent the time in Christs
preaching and their Hearing and Conferring after
of it. 2. But we grant that though the Foundation
was laid by Christs Resurrection, yet it was not a
Law fully promulgate to, and understood by the
Apostles till the <hi>Coming down of the Holy Ghost</hi>
(nor many greater matters neither) who was
<hi>promised</hi> and <hi>given</hi> to <hi>teach them all things</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>

his Chap. 3. l.</hi> 2. [The Lords day taken up by
the common consent of the Church, not instituted or
established by any Text of Scripture, or Edict of
Emperour, or Decree of Council, save that some
few Councils did reflect upon it: In that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows

Testimonies of the fourth Century, that is
Emperours, Councils, and the most pious and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59348:29"/>
learned Fathers, attesting that the Universal
Church received it from the Apostles, is not
vain or a small Evidence; when as the fourth
Century began but 200 years after St. <hi>Johns</hi>
death, or within less than a year.</p>
                     <p>And that the first Christian Emperour finding
all Christians unanimous in the possession of the
day, should make a Law (as our Kings do) for
the due observing of it; And that the first Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Council should establish uniformity in the
very Gesture of Worship on that day, are strong
Confirmations of the matter of fact, that the
Churches unanimously agreed in the holy use of
it as a separated day even <hi>from and in the Apostles
dayes.</hi>

                        <hi>Theodosius</hi> also enacted that on the Lords day
and in the <hi>Christmas,</hi> and on <hi>Easter</hi> and to <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suntide</hi>
the publike Cirques and Theaters should
be shut up. (For we grant that when Christian
Magistrates took the matter in hand, other Holy
dayes were brought in by degrees; whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Christians indeed met (yea and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated)
as oft as they could, even most daies
in the week; but did not separate the daies as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to Gods service as they did the Lords day:
Only <hi>Christmas</hi> day, and the Memorials of those
Martyrs that were neer them (to encourage the
people to constancy) they honoured somewhat
early; But those were <hi>anniversary,</hi> and not <hi>week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
And the <hi>Wednesdays,</hi> and <hi>Fridays,</hi> were kept
by them but as we keep them now, or as a
Lecture day.</p>
                     <p>I grant also that when Christian Magistracie
arose, as the Holy dayes multiplied, the manner
of the dayes observation altered. For whereas
from the <hi>beginning,</hi> the Christians used to stay
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59348:30"/>
together from <hi>morning till night,</hi> (partly through
<hi>devotion,</hi> and partly for fear of <hi>persecution,</hi> if they
were noted to go in and out;) Afterward being
free, they met twice a day, with intermission as
we do now. Not that their whole dayes Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
was but an hour or two as <hi>Heylin</hi> would
prove from a perverted word of <hi>Chrysostomes</hi> and
another of <hi>Origenes</hi> (or <hi>Ruffinus</hi>) and from the
length of their published Homilies: For he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verteth
what was spoken of the length of the
<hi>Sermon,</hi> as spoken of the length of all the <hi>Service</hi>
of the <hi>whole day:</hi> whereas there was much more
time spent in the <hi>Eucharistical</hi> and <hi>Liturgick</hi> offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
of Prayer, Praise, Sacraments, and Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
proper to the Church, than was in the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi>
When I was suffered to exercise my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
my self, having four hundred or five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
if not six hundred to administer the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to (though twice the number kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
away) it took up the time of <hi>two Sermons</hi>
usually to administer it, besides all the ordinary
Readings, Prayers and Praises Morning and Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>

Kneeling at the Sacrament; which last he prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
from two or three words where <hi>Adoration</hi>
only is named: But, 1. A late Treatise hath fully
proved that the <hi>White garment</hi> was not a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Ceremony then at all, but the Ordinary <hi>splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did

which were thought meet for the honour of the

them. 2. And he quite forgot that Adoration on

the Lords dayes was ever used <hi>standing,</hi> and that
he had said before, that it was above a thousand
years before the custome was altered.</p>

Prophets: And therefore it is very meet that
we should celebrate this day with one accord,

we are freed from the Goal of error: not
that the Lord exacts it of us, that we should
celebrate this day in a corporal abstinence or
rest from labour, who only looks that we do
yield obedience to his holy will, by which
contemning earthly things, he may conduct
us to the Heavens of his infinite mercy. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

of the Emperour <hi>Leo Philosophus,</hi> to the
same purpose [<hi>Secundum quod Spiritui sancto ab

                              <am>

You see that then Christian Princes judged the
Lords day to be of Divine Institution. Yea, to
these he addeth two more Princes of the same
mind, confessing that <hi>Leo</hi> was himself a Scholar,
and <hi>Charles</hi> the Great had as Learned men about
him, as the times then bred, and yet were thus
perswaded of the day; yea, and that many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
were pretended in confirmation of it; yet
he affirmeth, that the <hi>Church and the most learned
men in it were of another mind.</hi> Let us hear his
proofs.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Saith he,</hi> Isidore <hi>a Bishop of</hi> Sevil makes it
an Apostolical Sanction only, no Divine Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
a day designed by the Apostles, for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Exercises in honour of our Saviours resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;
and it was called the Lords day therefore:
to this end and purpose, that resting in the same
from all earthly acts and the temptations of the world,
we might intend Gods holy Worship, giving this
day due honour for the hope of the resurrection
which we have therein. <hi>The same</hi> verbatim <hi>is
repeated by</hi> Beds l. de Offic. <hi>and by</hi> Raban. Maurus
l. de inst. Chr. l. 2. c. 24. and by Alcuinus de
Die Offic. c. 24. which plainly shews, that all these
took it only for an Apostolical usage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Reader, is not here a strange kind of
proof? This is but just the same that we assert,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59348:32"/>
and I am proving; save that he most grosly puts
an <hi>Apostolical usage,</hi> and <hi>sanction (sanxerunt)</hi>
as distinct from, and exclusive of a <hi>Command,</hi>
which I have fully proved to be Christs own
Act and Law to us, by vertue of 1. Their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission:
2. And the infallible Spirit given them.</p>
                     <p>And having brought the History to so fair an
account by our chief Adversaries own Citations
and confessions, I will not tire my self and the
Reader with any more; but only wish every
Christian to consider, whether they that thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
between <hi>Apostolical Sanctions,</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Institutions</hi> as this man doth, do not teach
men to deny all the holy Scriptures of the New
Testament, as being but Apostolical writings:
and go far to deny or subvert Christianity it
self; by denying the Divine Authority of these
Commissioned Inspired men, who are foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Church, and sealed their Doctrine by
Miracles, and from whom it is that our Christian
Faith, and Laws, and Church constitutions which
are Universal and Divine, are received.</p>
                     <p>I only remember you of <hi>Pliny</hi> a Heathens te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony,
of the Christians practice <hi>stato die.</hi>
No man can question <hi>Pliny</hi> on the account of
Partiality: And therefore though a Heathen,
his Historical testimony as joyned with all the
Christian Church History, hath its credibility.
He telleth <hi>Trajan,</hi> that it was the use of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<hi>on a stated day, before it was light to meet
together, to sing a Hymn to Christ as to God</hi> secum
invicem, <hi>among themselves by turns; and to bind
themselves by a Sacrament, not to do any wickedness,
but that they commit not Thefts, Robberies, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59348:33"/>
that they break not their word (or trust)
that they deny not the pledge (or pawn); which
being ended they used to depart, and to come again
together to take meat, but promiscuous and harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.</hi>]
Epist. 97. p. 306, 307.</p>
                     <p>Where note, 1. That by a <hi>stated day,</hi> he can
mean no other than the <hi>Lords day,</hi> as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of all other History will prove. 2. That
this is much like the testimonies of <hi>Justin</hi> and
<hi>Tertullian,</hi> and (supposing what they say of the
use of Reading the Scripture, and Instructing the
Church) it sheweth that their chief work on
that day, was the Praises of God for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
by Christ, and the celebration of the
Lords Supper; and the Disciplinary exercises of
Covenanters thereto belonging. 3. That they
had at that time where <hi>Pliny</hi> was two meetings
that day, that is, they went home, and came
again to their Feast of Love, in the Evening.
(Which, no doubt, was varied, as several times,
and places, and occasions required; sometimes
departing and coming again, and sometimes
staying together all day.) 4. That this Epistle
of <hi>Pliny</hi> was written in <hi>Trajans</hi> dayes, and it is
supposed in his second year: And <hi>Trajan</hi> was
Emperour the year that St. <hi>John</hi> the Apostle died,
if not a year before; so that it is the Churches
custom in the end of the Apostles dayes, which
<hi>Pliny</hi> here writeth of. 5. That he had the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
testimony of what he wrote, it being the
consent of the Christians whom he, as Judge,
examined; even of the timorous that denyed
their Religion, as well as of the rest. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them upon his prohibition forbore these
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59348:33"/>
meetings. 6. And the number of them he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<hi>Trajan</hi> in City and Countrey was great, of
persons of all degrees and ranks.</p>
                     <p>So that when 1. Christian History, 2. And
Heathen, acquaint us with the matter <hi>of fact,</hi>
that the day was kept in the Apostles time;
3. Yea, when no Hereticks or Sects of Christians
are found contradicting it, but the Churches then
and after universally practised it without any
controversie; what fuller historical evidence can
there be? And to say, that 1. The Apostles would
not have reproved this, if it had not been their
own doing: 2. Or that it could be done, and
they not know it: 3. And that all Christians
who acknowledged their authority, would have
consented in such a practice superstitiously be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their faces, and against their wills, and no
testimony be left us of one faithful Church or
Christian that contradicted it, and stuck to the
Apostolical authority, even where the Churches
received their writings, and publickly read
them, all this is such, as is not by sober Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
to be believed.</p>
                     <p>But the great Objection will be, <hi>That other
things also were then taken for Apostolical Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and were customs of the universal Church,
as well as this; which things we now renounce as
superstitious.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Though I answered this briefly before,
I now give you this fuller answer: I. It is but
few things that come under this charge, <hi>viz.</hi> the
Unction, white Garment, with the taste of Milk
and Honey at Baptism, Adoration towards the
East, and that standing; and not kneeling on the

                        <pb n="50" facs="tcp:59348:35"/>
Lords dayes, and the Anniversary Observation
of <hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Whitsuntide:</hi> And the last is but the
keeping of one or two Lords dayes in the year
with some note of distinction from the rest, so
far as there was any agreement in it. 2. That
these are not usually by the Antients called Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical
Traditions, but <hi>Customs of the Vniversal
Church:</hi> 3. That when they are called <hi>Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
from the Apostles, it is not with any asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that the Apostles instituted them, but that
they are supposed to be from their times, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
their Original is not known. 4. That the
Antients joyn not the Lords day with these, but
take the Lords day for an Apostolical institution
written in Scripture, though the universal pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of all Churches fullier deliver the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
History of it: But the rest they take for
<hi>unwritten Customs,</hi> as distinct from Scripture Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.
(As <hi>Epiphanius</hi> fully sheweth.)
5. That most Christians are agreed, that if these
later could be proved Apostolical Institutions for
the Church universal, it would be our duty to
use them, though they were not in Scripture.
So that we reject them only for want of such
proof: But the proof of the Lords dayes sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
being far better (by concurrence of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
and all antient History) it followeth not
that we must doubt of that which hath full and
certain proof, because we must doubt of that
which wants it. 6. And if it were necessary that
they stood or fell together (as it is not) it were
necessary that we did receive those three or four
Ceremonies, for the sake of the Lords day, which
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ath so great evidence, rather than that we cast
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59348:35"/>
off the Lords day, because of these Ceremonies.
Not only because there is more Good in the
Lords d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y, than there is evil to be any way su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected
by a doubter in these Ceremonies; but
especially because the Evidence for the day is
so great, that if the said Ceremonies had but the
same, they were undoubtedly of Divine autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
or institution. In a word, I have shewed
you somewhat of the evidence for the Lords
day; Do you now shew me the like <hi>for them,</hi>
and then I will prove that both must be receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
But if you cannot, do not pretend a parity.
7. And the same Churches laying by the <hi>Customs</hi>
aforesaid, or most of them, did shew that they
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ok them not indeed for Apostolical institutions,
as they did the Lords day which they continued
to observe; not as a Ceremony, but as a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
thing. 8. And the ancient Churches did
believe, that even in the Apostles dayes some
things were used as Indifferent which were mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
and were not Laws, but temporary cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms.
And some things were necessary, setled
by Law for perpetuity: Of the former kind they
thought were, the greeting one another with a
holy kiss, the Womens praying covered with a
Veil, (of which the Apostle saith, that it was
then and there so decent, that the contrary
would have been unseemly, and the Churches
of God had no such custom, (by which he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth
the contentious) yet in other Countreys,
where custom altereth the signification, it may
be otherwise: Also that a man wear not long
hair; and that they have a Love Feast on the
Lords day, (which yet <hi>Paul</hi> seemeth to begin
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59348:36"/>
to alter in his rebuke of the abusers of it,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.) And if these ancient Churches
thought the Milk and Honey, and the white
Garment, and the Station and Adoration East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
to be also such like indifferent mutable
customs, as it is apparent they did, this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all to invalidate our proof, that the
Lords day was used (and consequently appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
in the dayes of the Apostles.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> At least it will prove it mutable as they
were.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> No such matter: Because the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of such Circumstances, having no stated ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
or usefulness, sheweth them to be mutable.
But the reason of the Lords dayes use is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual:
And it is founded partly in the Law of
nature, which telleth us that some stated dayes
should be set apart for holy things; and partly
in the positive part of the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
which telleth us, that <hi>once God determined
of one day in seven,</hi> yea, and this upon the
ground of his own Cessation of his Creation-work,
that man on that day might observe a
Holy Rest in the worshipping of the great Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,
which is a Reason belonging not to the
Jews only, but to the whole world. Yea, and
that Reason (whatever Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> say to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
from the meer silence of the former Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
in <hi>Genesis</hi>) doth seem plainly to intimate
that this is but the repetition of that Law of
the Sabbath which was given to <hi>Adam:</hi> For
why should God begin two thousand years after
to give men a Sabbath upon the reason of his
rest from the Creation, and for the Commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59348:36"/>
of it, if he had never called man to that
Commemoration before.</p>
                     <p>And it is certain that the Sabbath was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
at the falling of Manna before the giving
of the Law: And let any considerate Christian
judge between Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> and us in this; 1. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the not <hi>fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ing of Manna,</hi> or the <hi>Rest of God</hi>
after the Creation, was like to be the Original
reason of the Sabbath. 2. And whether if it had
been the <hi>first,</hi> it would not have been said, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
to keep holy the Sabbath day; for on six
dayes Manna fell, and not on the seventh,</hi>] ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than [<hi>For in six dayes God created Heaven
and Earth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and rested the seventh day.</hi>] And
it is causally added, [<hi>Wherefore the Lord blessed
the Sabbath day and hallowed it.</hi>] Nay, consider
whether this annexed Reason intimate not, that
the day on this ground being hallowed before,
therefore it was that God sent not down the
Manna on that day, and that he prohibited the
people from seeking it.</p>
                     <p>And he that considereth the brevity of the
History in <hi>Genesis,</hi> will think he is very bold,
that obtrudeth on the world his Negative Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
[<hi>The Sabbath is not there mentioned:
therefore it was not then kept.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>And if it was a <hi>Positive Law</hi> given to <hi>Adam</hi>
on the reason of the <hi>Creation Rest,</hi> it was then
<hi>such a Positive,</hi> as must be <hi>next</hi> to a <hi>Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
and was given to all mankind in <hi>Adam,</hi>
and <hi>Adam</hi> must needs be obliged to deliver it
down to the world.</p>
                     <p>So that though the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Law (even as
given in Stone) be ceased, yea, and <hi>Adams</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitives
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59348:37"/>
too, formally as such; yet this is sure,
that <hi>once God himself determined by a Law, that
one stated day in seven, was the fittest proportion
of time to be separated to holy Worship.</hi> And if
it was so once, yea, to all the world from the
Creation, it is so still: Because there is still the
same reason for it: And we are bound to judge
Gods determination of the proportion to be wiser
than any that we can make. And so by parity
of Reason consequentially even those abrogated
Laws do thus far bind us still; not so far as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated;
but because the record and reason of
them, is still a signification of the due propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of time, and consequently of our duty.</p>
                     <p>Now the Lords day, supposing one weekly
day to be due, and being but that day determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
of, and this upon the Reason of the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
and for the Commemoration of our
Redemption, and that by such inspired and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
persons, it followeth clearly, that this
is no such mutable ceremony, as a Love Feast, or
the Kiss of Love, or the Veil, or the washing of
feet, or the anointing of the sick, which were
mostly occasionall actions and customs taken
up upon reasons proper to those times and
places.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> But by the reason aforesaid, you will
prove the continuance of the seventh day Sabbath;
as grounded on the Creation rest.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> This is anom to be answered in due
place. I only prove that it continued, till a
successive dispensation, and Gods own change did
put an end to it; but no longer.</p>

ceaseth not.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> True: but that it be done on the <hi>seventh
day;</hi> is that which ceaseth. For the <hi>same work</hi>
is transferred to the <hi>Lords day;</hi> and the <hi>Creator
and Redeemer</hi> to be honoured together in our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration.
For the <hi>Son</hi> is the only way to the
Father; who hath restored us to Peace with our
Creator; And as no man cometh to the Father
but by the Son, and as we must not now wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship

but as a Creator and Father reconciled by Christ,
so is it the appointment of Christ by the Holy
Ghost, that we commemorate the work of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
now as repaired and restored by the work
of Redemption, on the Lords day, which is
now separated to these works.</p>

                        <hi>We may therefore summ up the prerogatives
of the Lords day, as</hi> Leo <hi>did,</hi> Ep. 81. c. 1. On
this day the world began; on this day by Christs
Resurrection, Death did receive Death, and Life its
beginning; on this day the Apostles take the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet

not contradicted</hi> by any Sect in the world, be to be
believed, then we must say, that the Lords day
was commonly kept by the Christians in and
from the Apostles times.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prop.</hi> 11. This evidence of the Churches univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
constant usage, is a full and sufficient proof of
the matter of fact, that it was a day set apart by
the Apostles for holy Worship, especially in the
publick Church-assemblies.</p>
                     <p>1. It is a full proof, that such <hi>Assemblies were
held on that day above others, as a separated day.</hi>
For if it was the usage in <hi>Anno</hi> 100. (in which
the Apostle <hi>John</hi> dyed) it must needs be the
usage in the year 99. in which he wrote his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations,
where he calleth it the <hi>Lords day:</hi> For
all the Churches could not silently agree on a
sudden to take up a new day, without debate
and publick notice, which could not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed.
And if it was the universal usage in
the dayes of <hi>Ignatius</hi> or <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> it was so
also in the dayes of St. <hi>John,</hi> (and so before)
For the Churches were then so far dispersed
over the world, that it would have taken up
much time to have had Councils and meetings
or any other means for agreement on such
things.</p>
                     <p>And it is utterly improbable that there would
have been no dissenters? For, 1. Did <hi>no Christians</hi>
in the world so neer to the Apostles daies make
any scruple of <hi>superstition?</hi> or of such an addition
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59348:39"/>
to Divine institutions? 2. Was there no Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
nor no persons whose <hi>interest</hi> would not
better suit with another day, or an uncertain day?
or at least their <hi>opinions?</hi> when we find it now
so hard a matter to bring men in one Countrey,
to be all of one opinion. 3. And there was then
no <hi>Magistrate</hi> to <hi>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>rce</hi> them to such an Union;
And therefore it mast be <hi>voluntary.</hi> 4. And they
had in the <hi>second age</hi> such Pastors as the <hi>Apostles
themselves</hi> had <hi>ordained,</hi> and as had conversed
with them, and been trained up by them and
knew their mind, and cannot soberly be thought
likely to consent all on a sudden to such a new
institution, without and contrary to the Apostles
sense and practice. 5. Yea, they had yet Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
that had that <hi>extraordinary spirit</hi> which was
given by the laying on of the Apostles hands:
For if the <hi>aged Apostles</hi> ordained <hi>young men,</hi> it is
to be supposed that most of those young men,
(such as <hi>Timothy</hi>) overlived them. 6. Yea and
the <hi>ordinary Christians</hi> in those times had those
<hi>extraordinary gifts</hi> by the laying on of the Apostles
hands, as appeareth evidently in the case of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria,</hi>
Act. 8. and of the Corinthians, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
12. &amp; 14. and of the Galathians, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3.
And it is not to be suspected that all these <hi>inspired
Ministers</hi> and <hi>people</hi> would consent to a superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
innovation, without and against the Apostles
minds.</p>
                     <p>2. Therefore this history is a full proof, that
these things <hi>were done by the consent and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Apostles.</hi> For, 1. As is said, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
persons and Churches could not so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
be brought to <hi>forsake them universally</hi> in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59348:39"/>
such a case. 2. The Churches had all so high
an <hi>esteem</hi> of the Apostles, that they took their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
for the highest, and their judgement for
<hi>infallible,</hi> and therefore received their writings as
<hi>Canonical and Divine.</hi> 3. The Churches pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
to observe the Lords day as an <hi>Apostolical
Ordinance,</hi> And they cannot be all supposed to
have conspired in a <hi>lie,</hi> yea to have <hi>belyed the Holy
Ghost.</hi> 4. The <hi>Apostles themselves</hi> would have control<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
this course, if it had not been by their own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.
For I have proved that the usage was in
their <hi>own daies.</hi> And they were not so careless of the
preservation of Christs Ordinances and Churches,
as to let such things be done, without contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
when it is known how <hi>Paul</hi> strove to resist and
retrench all the corruptions of Church-order in the
Churches to which he wrote. If the Apostles, silently
connived at such corruptions, how could we rest on
their authority? Especially the Apostle <hi>John</hi> in
<hi>an.</hi> 99 would rather have written against it as the
superstition of Usurpers (as he checkt <hi>Diotrephes</hi>
for contempt of him) than have said that he <hi>was
in the Spirit on the Lords day</hi> when he saw Christ,
and received his Revelation and message to the
Churches. 5. And if the Churches had taken
up this practice universally without the Apostles,
it is utterly improbable that no Church writer
would have committed to memory either that <hi>one
Church</hi> that begun the custome, or the <hi>Council</hi> or
<hi>means</hi> used for a sudden Confederacy therein.
If it had begun with <hi>some one Church,</hi> it would
have been long before the rest would have been
brought to an agreeing Consent. It was many
hundred years before they all agreed of the Time
of <hi>Easter;</hi> And it was till the middle of <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostomes</hi>
                        <pb n="60" facs="tcp:59348:40"/>
time (for he saith it was but ten years
agoe, when he wrote it) that they agreed of the
time of Christs Nativity.</p>
                     <p>But if it had been done by Confederacy at
once, the motion, the Council called about it,
the debates, and the dissenters and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistances
would all have been matter of fact, so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
as would have found a place in some Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
or Church History: Whereas there is not a
Syllable of any such thing; either of Council,
letter, messenger, debate, resistance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is evident that the thing was done by the
Apostles.</p>
                     <p>

Christian faith, or give away or deny the necessary
means of proving the truth of it, and of many great
particulars of Religion.</p>
                     <p>I suppose that in my Book called <hi>The Reasons

is proved true, by the SPIRIT as the
great witness of Christ, and of the Christian
Verity; But I have proved withall, the necessity
and certainty of historical means, to bring the
matters of fact to our notice, as sense it self did
bring them to the notice of the first receivers.
For instance,</p>

                     <p>If any say that the Books do prove themselves
to be Canonical or Divine, I answer, 1. What
man alive could tell without historical proof that
the <hi>Canticles,</hi> or <hi>Esther,</hi> are Canonical? yea or
<hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> or the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> and not the Books of
<hi>Wisdome</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiasticus?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. How can any man know that the <hi>Scripture
histories</hi> are Canonical? The suitableness of them
to a holy soul, will do much to confirm one that
is already holy, of the truth of the <hi>Doctrines:</hi>
But if the spirit within us assure us immediately
of the truth of the <hi>History,</hi> it must be by <hi>Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
and <hi>Revelation,</hi> which no Christians have,
that ever I was yet acquainted with. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
that the Books of <hi>Chronicles</hi> are Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
or the Book of <hi>Either,</hi> or the Books of the
<hi>Kings,</hi> or <hi>Samuel,</hi> or <hi>Judges.</hi> And how much
doth the <hi>doctrine</hi> of Christianity depend on the
<hi>history?</hi> As of the <hi>Creation,</hi> of the Israelites bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
and deliverance, and the giving of the
Law, and <hi>Moses</hi> miracles, and of Chronologie
and Christs Genealogie; and of the History of
Christs own Nativity, Miracles and Life; and
the History of the Apostles afterward? To say
that the very History so far proveth its own
truth, as that without subsequent History we can
be sure of it, and must be, is to reduce all Christs
Church of right believers into a narrow room;
when I never knew the man that (as far as I could
perceive) did know the History to be Divine
by its proper evidence, without Tradition, and
subsequent History.</p>

and wranglers through partiality and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
against each others will some throw away
one part and some another, they will all prove
destroyers of the faith (as all dividers be.) If
the Papist will say, It is <hi>Tradition</hi> and not <hi>inhae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Evidence,</hi> or if others will say that it is
<hi>inhaerent evidence alone,</hi> and not <hi>history or Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
where God hath made both needful here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59348:41"/>
both will be found injurious to the
faith.</p>
                     <p>II. Without this <hi>historical</hi> evidence we cannot
prove that any of the books of Scripture are not
<hi>maimed</hi> or <hi>depraved.</hi> That they come to our
hands as the Apostles and Evangelists wrote them,
uncorrupted. It is certain by History, that many
Hereticks <hi>did deprave</hi> and <hi>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>rrupt</hi> them, and would
have obtruded those Copies or Corruptions on
the Churches: And how we shall certainly prove
that they did not prevail, or that <hi>their copies</hi>
are <hi>false,</hi> and <hi>ours</hi> are <hi>true,</hi> I know not without
the help of History. <hi>Mahomet</hi> and his followers
(more numerous than the Christians) pretend
that <hi>Mahomets</hi> name was in the Gospel of <hi>John</hi>
as the <hi>Paraclet</hi> or <hi>Comforter</hi> promised by Christ,
and that the Christians have blotted it out, and
altered the Writings of the Gospel. And how
shall we disprove them but by Historical Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence?
As the Arrians, and Socinians pretend
that we have added, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 7. for the Trinity,
so others say of other Texts; And how shall we
confute them without Historical Evidence?</p>
                     <p>III. Therefore we cannot make good the
Authority of <hi>any one single Verse or Text</hi> of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
which we shall alledge, without <hi>historical</hi>
evidence. Because we are not certain of that
<hi>particular text,</hi> (or <hi>words,</hi>) whether it have
been altered or added, or corrupted, by the fraud
of Hereticks, or the partiality of some Christians,
or the oversight of Scribes: For if a <hi>Custome</hi> of
setting apart one day weekly, even the first, for
publick Worship, might creep into all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in the World, and no man know how, nor
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59348:42"/>
when; much more might one or a few corrupt
Copies become the exemplar of those that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
For, <hi>what day</hi> all the Churches meet, men,
women, and children know; Learned and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
know; the Orthodox and Hereticks
know; and they <hi>so know,</hi> as that they <hi>cannot
choose</hi> but know. But the alterations of a <hi>Text,</hi>

Who is it that doth not presently fly to <hi>historical

                        </gap>ess to be uncertain? And if Copies and
History had delivered to us as various Readings
o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>every Text</hi> as they have done of <hi>some,</hi> every
Text would have remained uncertain to us.</p>
                     <p>Let none say that this leaveth the <hi>Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
or the <hi>Scriptures</hi> uncertain: I have fully
answered that elsewhere. 1. <hi>Christian Religion,</hi>
that is, The <hi>Material parts</hi> of the Scripture on
which our <hi>salvation lyeth,</hi> hath much fuller evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
than <hi>each particular Text</hi> or <hi>Canonical
Book</hi> hath. And we need not regard the perverse
zeal for the Scriptures of those men that would
make all our Christianity as uncertain, as the
authority of a <hi>particular Text</hi> or <hi>book</hi> is. And
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59348:42"/>
therefore God in mercy hath so ordered it, that
a thousand Texts may be uncertain to us, or not
understood (no not by any or many Divines)
and yet the <hi>Christian faith</hi> be not at all shaken, or
ever the more uncertain for this: When as he
that understandeth not or believeth not every
<hi>essential Article of the faith,</hi> is <hi>no Christian.</hi>
2. And those <hi>books</hi> and <hi>Texts</hi> of Scripture, are
fully certain by the <hi>subservient help</hi> of <hi>History</hi>
and <hi>usage,</hi> which would be <hi>uncertain</hi> without
them. Therefore it is the act of an enemy of
the Scriptures, to cast away, and dispute against
that <hi>History</hi> which is necessary to our knowledge
of its <hi>certainty,</hi> and afterwards to plead that they
who take in those necessary helps <hi>do make it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain:</hi>
Even as if they should go about to prove
that <hi>all writings</hi> are uncertain, and therefore that
they make Christs doctrine uncertain, who rest
upon the credit of writings, that is, the Sacred
Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>IV. Without historical notice, how should we
know that these Books were written by any of
the same men that bear their names? As <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,
Mark, Luke, John, Paul, Peter,</hi> &amp;c. Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when the Hereticks did put forth the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
of <hi>Thomas, Nicodemus,</hi> the Itinerary of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
and many Books under venerable names?
Or when the name of the Author is not notified
to all Christians certainly, either by the spirit
within us, or by the matter? And though our
salvation depend not on the notice of the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
yet it is of great moment in the matter of
faith.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="66" facs="tcp:59348:43"/>
V. And how should we be certain that <hi>no other
Sacred Books</hi> are lost, the knowledge of which
would tell us of that which <hi>these</hi> contain not,
and would help us to the better understanding
of these? I know that a <hi>priore</hi> we may argue
from Gods Goodness, that he will not so forsake
his Church, As a Jew might have done before
Christs incarnation, that the Gospel should be
<hi>written,</hi> because it is best for the world or Church.
But when we consider how much of the world
and Church, God hath forsaken, since the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and how dark we are in such Prognosticks,
and how little we know what the Churches sins
may provoke God to, we should be less confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of such reasonings, than we are of Historical
Evidence, which tells us <hi>de facto</hi> what God hath
done. So much of the use of the History, as
to the Cause of the Scriptures themselves.</p>
                     <p>Next you may observe that the denyal of the
certainty of humane History and usage, doth
disadvantage Christianity in many great particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
concernments. As, 1. Without it we should
not fully know whether <hi>de facto</hi> the Church and
Ministry dyed, or almost dyed with the Apostles?
And whether there have been any true Churches
since then till our own dayes? Christs promise
indeed tells us much; but if we had no History
of the performance of it, we should be ready to
doubt that it might be yet unperformed; as far
as the promise to <hi>Adam</hi> (Gen. 3. 15.) and to
<hi>Abraham</hi> (<hi>in thy seed shall all the Nations of the
earth be blessed</hi>) were till the coming of Christ.
Nor could we easily confute the <hi>Roman</hi> or any
hereticall Usurpation, which would pretend pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59348:43"/>
since the Apostles daies, and that all that
are since gone to Heaven, have gone thither by
their way, and not by ours.</p>
                     <p>II. Nor could we much better tell <hi>de facto,</hi>
whether Baptism have been administred in the
form appointed by Christ, <hi>In the name of the Father,
of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost?</hi> Indeed we may
well and truly argue a <hi>priore,</hi> Christ commanded
it, <hi>Ergo</hi> the Apostles obeyed him: But, 1. That
Argument would hold good as to none or few
but the Apostles: And, 2. It would as to them,
be though true, yet much more dark than now it
is, because, 1. We read that <hi>Peter</hi> disobeyed his
command, in <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. And, 2. That after he had
commanded them to Preach the Gospel to every
Creature, and all the World, <hi>Peter</hi> scrupled still
going to the Gentiles, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. And, 3. That
when he said to them, <hi>Pray thus</hi> [<hi>Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
&amp;c.</hi>] yet we never read that they after used
that form of words; so when he said to them
[<hi>Baptize in the name of the Father, &amp;c.</hi>] yet the
Scripture never mentioneth that they or any other
person, ever used that form of words. But yet
usage and History assureth us that they did.</p>
                     <p>III. Nor have we any fuller Scripture proof,
that the Apostles used to require of those that
were to be Baptized any more than a general
Profession of the substance of the Christian
faith, in God the Father, the Son, and the
Holy Ghost; Or of the ancient use of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Creed, either in the words now used, or
any of the same importance. From whence
many would inferr that any one is to be Baptized,
who will but say, that [<hi>I believe that Jesus
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59348:44"/>
Christ is the Son of God</hi>] with the Eunuch, <hi>Act.</hi>
8. 37. or that Christ is come in the flesh, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi>
4. 2, 3.</p>
                     <p>But Historical evidence assureth us, that it was
usual in those times, to require of men a <hi>more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite
understanding profession</hi> of the Christian
faith before they were admitted to Baptisme;
And that they had a summary or Symbole, fitted to
that use, commonly called The Apostles Creed; at
least as to the constant tenour of the matter, though
some words might be left to the speakers will,
and some little subordinate Articles may be since
added. And that it was long after the use to
keep men in the state of Catechised persons, till
they understood that Creed. And it is in it self
exceeding probable that though among the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
Jews, who had long expected the Messiah,
the Apostles did Baptize thousands in a day,
<hi>Act.</hi> 2. Yet where the Miraculous communication
of the Spirit did not antecede (as it did <hi>Act.</hi> 10.)
they would make poor Heathens who had been
bred in ignorance to understand what they did
first, and would require of them an understanding
profession of their <hi>Belief in God the Father, Son,
and Holy Ghost;</hi> which could not possibly (if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding)
contain much less than the <hi>Symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
fid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>i,</hi> the Apostles Creed.</p>
                     <p>IV. Nor have we any Scripture proof, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
by inferring <hi>obedience</hi> from the precept) that
ever the <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> was used in words, after
Christ commanded or delivered it: Whence some
inferr that it <hi>should not</hi> be so used: But Church
History putteth that past doubt. Other such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
I pretermit.</p>

                        <pb n="69" facs="tcp:59348:44"/>
I think now that I have fully proved to sober
considerate Christians, that the matter of fact
(that the <hi>Lords day</hi> was appointed by the Apostles
peculiarly for Church-Worship) is certain to us
by historical Evidence, added to the historical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timations
in Scripture as a full exposition and
confirmation of it: And that this is a proof
that no Christian can deny without unsufferable
injury to the Scriptures and the Christian
cause.</p>

Errour of them who keep <hi>both daies</hi> as of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

guilty but of <hi>one</hi> (the keeping of the <hi>wrong</hi> day.)
Besides that if it were not done, with a supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious

But yet, though the rejecting of the Lords day
be the greater fault (and I have no uncharitable
censures of them that through weakness keep
both daies) I must conclude it as the truth, that
<hi>We are not obliged to the observation of the</hi> Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day

                     <p>And, 1. That the Law of Nature bindeth us

3. By all the <hi>Worlds experience:</hi> No man can

because I can consent that <hi>all they</hi> take the <hi>seventh
day for the Sabbath,</hi> who can prove it to be so
by <hi>meer natural Evidence:</hi> which will not be
one.</p>
                     <p>II. That the <hi>Positive Law</hi> made to <hi>Adam</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
or <hi>after</hi> the fall) or to <hi>Noah,</hi> bindeth not us
to keep the seventh day as a Sabbath, is proved.</p>
                     <p>1. Because we are under a more <hi>perfect subsequent
Law;</hi> which being in force, the former more <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
ceaseth.</hi> As the force of the <hi>Promise</hi> of the
Incarnation of Christ is ceased by <hi>his incarnation,</hi>
and so is the <hi>precept</hi> which bound men to believe
that he should <hi>de future</hi> be incarnate; and the
Law of <hi>Sacrificing</hi> (which <hi>Abel</hi> doubtless re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from <hi>Adam,</hi> though one of late would
make it to be but <hi>will-worship;</hi>) so also is the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
day,</hi> as giving place to the day in which our
<hi>Redemption</hi> is primarily commemorated, as the
imperfect is done away when that which is more
perfect cometh.</p>
                     <p>2. Because that the Law of Christ containeth
an express revocation of the seventh day Sabbath,
as shall be shewed anon.</p>
                     <p>3. Because God never required <hi>two dayes</hi> in
<hi>seven</hi> to be kept as holy: Therefore the <hi>first</hi> day
being proved to be of Divine institution, the ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
of the <hi>seventh</hi> is thereby proved: For to
keep <hi>two dayes</hi> is contrary to the command which
they themselves do build upon, which requireth
us to sanctifie a Sabbath, and labour six dayes.</p>
                     <p>4. And when it is not probable that most or
many <hi>Infidels</hi> are bound to <hi>Adams</hi> day, for want
of notice (at least;) For no Law can bind
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59348:47"/>
without promulgation (though I now pass by the
question, how far a promulgation of a positive
to our first Parents may be said to bind their
posterity, that have no intermediate notice) It
seemeth leís probable that <hi>Christians</hi> should be
bound by it, who have a more perfect Law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgate
to them.</p>
                     <p>5. Nor is it probable that Christ and his
Apostles and all the following Pastors of the
Churches would have passed by this Positive Law
to <hi>Adam,</hi> without any mention of it, if our uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
obligation had been thence to be collected.
Nay I never yet heard a Sabbatarian plead this
Law, any otherwise than as supposed to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
or exemplified in the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>III. And that the fourth Commandment of
<hi>Moses</hi> Law bindeth us not to the seventh day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
is proved.</p>
                     <p>1. Because that <hi>Moses</hi> Law <hi>never bound</hi> any to
it but the Jews, and those Proselites that made
themselves inhabitants of their Land, or volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
subjected themselves to their policy. For
<hi>Moses</hi> was <hi>Ruler</hi> of none but the Jews; nor a
<hi>Legislator</hi> or <hi>deputed officer</hi> from God to any other
Nation. The <hi>Decalogue</hi> was but part of the
<hi>Jewish Law,</hi> if you consider it not as it is written
in <hi>Nature,</hi> but in <hi>Tables of Stone:</hi> And the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
Law was given as <hi>a Law</hi> to no other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
but to them. It was a <hi>National Law,</hi> as they
were a <hi>peculiar people and holy Nation.</hi> So that
even in <hi>Moses</hi> daies it bound no other Nations
of the World. Therefore it needed not any
<hi>abrogation</hi> to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but a <hi>declaration</hi> that it
did not bind them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="75" facs="tcp:59348:47"/>
2. The whole Law of <hi>Moses</hi> formally as such
is <hi>ceased</hi> or <hi>abrogated</hi> by Christ. I say, <hi>As such,</hi>
Because <hi>Materialy,</hi> the same things that are in
that Law, may be the <hi>matter</hi> of the Law of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
and of the Law of <hi>Christ:</hi> of which more
anon. That the <hi>whole Law</hi> of <hi>Moses as such</hi> is
abrogated, is most clearly proved, 1. By the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
arguings of <hi>Paul,</hi> who ever speaketh of
that Law as ceased without excepting any part,
And Christ saith, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 16. The Law and the
Prophets were untill <hi>John,</hi> that is, were the chief
doctrine of the Church till then, <hi>Joh. 1. 17. The
Law was given by</hi> Moses, <hi>but grace and truth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
by Jesus Christ.</hi> No Jew would have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
this, if the word [<hi>Law</hi>] had not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the Decalogue. So <hi>Joh. 7. 19, 23. Act.</hi>
15. 5, 24. It was the <hi>whole Law</hi> of <hi>Moses, as such</hi>
which <hi>by Circumcision</hi> they would have bound
men to. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 3. The Gentiles are said <hi>to sin
without Law,</hi> even when they broke the <hi>Law of
Nature,</hi> meaning [<hi>without the Law of</hi> Moses] <hi>Rom.</hi>
2. 12, 14, 15, 16. In all these following places its not
part but the <hi>whole Law of</hi> Moses, which <hi>Paul</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth
(which I ever acknowledged to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomians,
though they take me for their too
great Adversary,) <hi>Rom. 3. 19, 20, 21, 27,
28, 31, &amp; 4. 13, 14, 15, 16. &amp; 5. 13. 20. &amp; 7.
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 16. &amp; 9. 4, 31, 32. &amp; 10. 5.
Gal. 2. 16, 19, 21. &amp; 3. 2, 10, 11, 12, 13, 19,

                     <p>2. More particularly there are some Texts
which <hi>express</hi> the cessation of the <hi>Decalogue</hi> as it
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59348:48"/>
was <hi>Moses</hi> Law, 2 Cor. 3. 3, 7, 11. <hi>Not in Tables
of Stone, but in fleshly tables of the heart—But
if the Ministration of death written and engraven
in stones was glorious, so that the Children of</hi> Israel
<hi>could not stedfastly behold the face of</hi> Moses <hi>for the
glory of his Countenance, which was to be done away
(or is done away.)</hi> They that say the <hi>Glory,</hi> and
not <hi>the Law</hi> is here said to be <hi>done away,</hi> speak
against the plain scope of the Text: For the
Glory of <hi>Moses</hi> face, and the glorious manner of
deliverance ceased in a few daies, which is not
the cessation here intended; But (as Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
speaketh it) [<hi>that Glory and that Law so glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
delivered is done away</hi>] And this the
eleventh verse fullyer expresseth [<hi>For if that
which is done away was glorious</hi> (or, <hi>by Glory,)
much more that which remaineth is glorious,</hi> or (<hi>in
glory</hi>) so that as it is not only the <hi>Glory,</hi> but the
<hi>Glorious Law, Gospel</hi> or Testament which is said to
<hi>remain,</hi> so it is not only the <hi>Glory,</hi> but the
<hi>Law</hi> which was delivered <hi>by Glory</hi> which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
said to be done away: And this is the Law
which was written in Stone—Nothing but
partial violence can evade the force of this Text.</p>

that we are under no Divine Law, neither of

                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> But do not all Divines say that the Moral

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> Yes; Because it is Gods Law of Nature,
and also the Law of Christ.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> But do not most say that the Decalogue written
in stone, is the Moral Law and of perpetual obligation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes: for by the word [<hi>Moral</hi>] they
mean [<hi>Natural,</hi>] and so take <hi>Moral,</hi> not in the
large sense as it signifieth a Law <hi>de moribus</hi> as all
<hi>Laws</hi> are whatsoever, but in a narrower sense as
signifying, that which by <hi>Nature</hi> is of <hi>Vniversal</hi>
and <hi>perpetual</hi> obligation. So that they mean
not that it is perpetual as it is <hi>Moses</hi> Law and
written in Stone formally, but as it is <hi>Moral,</hi>
that is <hi>Natural;</hi> And they mean that <hi>Materially</hi>
the Decalogue containeth the same Law which is
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59348:49"/>
the Law of Nature, and therefore is <hi>materially</hi>
still in force: But they still except certain points
and circumstances in it, as the prefatory reason
[<hi>I am the Lord that brought thee out of the Land
of Aegypt, &amp;c.</hi>] And especially this of the seventh
day Sabbath.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Q</hi> 1. How far then are we bound by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. As it is the Law of Nature; 2. As it
is owned by Christ, and made part of his Law.
Therefore no more of it bindeth directly, than
we can prove to be either the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi>
or the Law of <hi>Christ.</hi> 3. As it was once a Law
of God to the Jews, and was given them upon
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> reason common to them with us or all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
we must still judge, that it was once a
Divine determination of what is most meet,
and an exposition of a Law of Nature, and
therefore consequentially, and as that which
intimateth by what God once commanded, what
we should take for his will, and is most meet,
it obligeth still. And so when the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
forbiddeth Incest, or too near marriages,
and God once told the Jews what degrees were
to be accounted too near, this being <hi>once</hi> a Law
to them <hi>directly,</hi> is a <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Exposition</hi> of
the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> still to us; and so is <hi>conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentially
a Law,</hi> by parity of reason. And so
we shall shew anon that it is by the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>IV.</hi> The Law of Christ bindeth us not to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of the seventh day Sabbath. <hi>Proved.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. Because it is proved that Christ abrogated
<hi>Moses</hi> Law as such; and it is no where proved
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59348:49"/>
that he reassumed this, as a part of his own
Law. For it is no part of the Law of <hi>Nature</hi>
(as is proved) (which we confess now to be
part of his Law.)</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> Christ saith, that he came not to destroy
the Law and Prophets, but to fulfill them, and
that a jot or tittle shall not pass till all be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> He is the end of the Law for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
to every one that believeth, Rom. 10. 4.
<hi>The Law was a Schoolmaster to bring us to Christ,</hi>
Gal. 3. 24. He hath therefore <hi>fulfilled</hi> the Law
according to his word, by his incarnation, life,
death and resurrection. It is past away, but not
unfulfilled: And fulfilling it, is not destroying
it. The ends of it are all attained by him:
2. And though having attained its end, it ceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>formally,</hi> as <hi>Moses</hi> Law; yet <hi>materially,</hi> all
that is of natural obligation continueth under
another <hi>form;</hi> that is, as part of <hi>his perfect Law.</hi>
Therefore as our childish knowledge is said, as
<hi>knowledge</hi> to be <hi>increased</hi> and not done away;
when we come to maturity; but as <hi>childish</hi> to
be done away, so the Mosaical Jewish Law, as
Gods <hi>Law in general</hi> is <hi>perfected</hi> by the cessati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the parts which were fitted to the state
of bondage, and by addition of more perfect
parts (The natural part of it is made a part of
a better Covenant or frame:) But yet as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saical</hi>
and <hi>imperfect</hi> it is abolished.</p>
                     <p>Briefly this much sufficeth for the answer of
all the allegations, by which any would prove
the continuation of <hi>Moses</hi> Law, or any part of
it formally as such. I only add, That all <hi>Moses</hi>
                        <pb n="80" facs="tcp:59348:50"/>
Law, even the Decalogue was <hi>Political,</hi> even
Gods Law for the Government of that particular
Theocrcratical Policy, as a Political body. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when the Kingdom or Policy ceased, the
Law as Political could not continue.</p>
                     <p>2. It is proved that Christ by his Spirit in his
Apostles did institute <hi>another day.</hi> And seeing
the Spirit was given them to bring his words
to remembrance, and to enable them to teach
the Churches all things whatsoever he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them, it is most probable that this was
at first one of Christs own personal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts.</p>
                     <p>3. And to put all out of doubt, that neither
the Law of Nature, nor any Positive Law, to
<hi>Adam, Noah,</hi> or <hi>Moses,</hi> or by Christ doth oblige
us to the seventh day Sabbath, it is expresly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed
by the Holy Ghost, Col. 2. 16. [<hi>Let no
man therefore judge you in meats or in drink, or
in respect of an Holy day (or Feast) or of the New
Moon, or of the Sabbaths, which are a shadow of
things to came; but the body is of Christ.</hi>] I
know many of late say, that by <hi>Sabbaths</hi> here is
not meant the <hi>weekly Sabbath,</hi> but only other
Holy dayes, as <hi>Monethly</hi> or <hi>Jubilee rests:</hi> But
1. This is to limit without any proof from the
word of God: When God speaks of <hi>Sabbaths</hi> in
<hi>general</hi> without exception, what is man that he
should put in exceptions without any proof of
Authority from God? By such boldness we may
pervert all his Laws. Read Dr. <hi>Young</hi> upon this
Text. 2. Yea, when it was the <hi>weekly Sabbath,</hi>
which then was <hi>principally</hi> known by the Name
of a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> above all other Festivals whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59348:50"/>
it is yet greater boldness without proof to
exclude the <hi>principal</hi> part, from whence the rest
did receive the name. 3. Besides the <hi>Feasts</hi> and
<hi>New Moons</hi> being here named as distinct from
the Sabbath, are like to include so much of the
other separated dayes, as will leave it still more
unmeet to exclude the weekly Sabbath in the
Explication of that word [<hi>Sabbaths</hi>] when
so many Feasts are first distinguished: <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> I am here to speak but of the
<hi>name;</hi> of which I say, that the common sense of
the word <hi>Sabbath</hi> was, <hi>a Day so appointed to
Rest, as that the bodily Rest of it, was a primary
part of its observation, to be kept for it self;</hi>
and such the Jewish Sabbaths were. Though
spiritual Worship was then also commanded, yet
the <hi>corporal Rest</hi> was more expresly or frequently
urged in the Law, and this not only subordinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as an advantage to the spiritual worship, but
<hi>for it self,</hi> as an immediate and most visible and
notable part of Sabbatizing. Even as other Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
under the Law were commanded, not
only as doctrinal Types of things spiritual, but
as external Acts of Ceremonious operous obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
suited to the Jews Minority, which is after
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59348:51"/>
called the <hi>yoke which they and their Fathers were
unable to bear,</hi> Acts 15. Whereas the <hi>Lords day</hi> is
appointed but as a <hi>seasonable time</hi> subserviently
to the <hi>spiritual work</hi> of the day; And the <hi>bodily
Rest,</hi> not required as <hi>primary obedience</hi> for <hi>it self,</hi>
but only <hi>for the spiritual work sake:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no bodily labour is now unlawful, but such

Rest</hi> of the <hi>Jews Sabbath,</hi> was a <hi>sin directly of
it self,</hi> without <hi>hinderance</hi> of, or <hi>respect</hi> to the
spiritual Worship. So that the <hi>first notion</hi> and
<hi>sense</hi> of a <hi>Sabbath</hi> in those dayes being (in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
use) <hi>A day of such Ceremonial Corporal
Rest,</hi> as the <hi>Jewish Sabbath was,</hi> the Lords day
is never in Scripture called by that name; but
the proper name is [<hi>The Lords day.</hi>] And the
ancient Churches called it constantly by that
<hi>name,</hi> and never called it the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> but when
they spake Analogically by allusion to the Jews
Sabbath; even as they called the holy Table,
<hi>the Altar,</hi> and the Bread and Wine, <hi>the Sacrifice.</hi>
Therefore it is plain, that <hi>Paul</hi> is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of all <hi>proper Sabbaths,</hi> and not of the <hi>Lords

                     <p>And this <hi>Ceremonial, Sabbatizing</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi>

day. The <hi>Lords</hi> day being not called a <hi>Sabbath</hi>
in the old sense then only in use, but <hi>distinguished</hi>
from the Sabbath cannot be meant by the Apostle
in his exclusion of the <hi>Sabbath.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ</hi> 1. You might as well say, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he is not for the cessation of the <hi>Jewish
manner of Worship, or Communion with them in it,</hi>
because <hi>he met with them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. And you may as well say, that he was for
the continuance of Circumcision and Purificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
because he purified himself and circumcised
<hi>Timothy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. Or that he was for the continuance of their
other Feasts, in which also he refused not to
joyn with them.</p>
                     <p>4. But <hi>Paul</hi> did not keep their Sabbaths for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
as Sabbaths, but only take the advantage
of their Assemblies, to teach them and convince
them; and to keep an interest in them: And
not scandalize them by an unseasonable violation
and contradiction.</p>
                     <p>5. And you must note also, that the Text saith
not [<hi>Observe not Sabbath dayes</hi>] but [<hi>Let no
man judge you</hi>] that is, Let none take it for your
sin, that you observe them not; nor do you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any such Doctrine of the <hi>necessity</hi> of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi>] The case seemeth like
that of <hi>things strangled</hi> and <hi>blood,</hi> which were
to be forborn among the Jews while they were
offensive, and the use of them hindred their
conversion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="84" facs="tcp:59348:52"/>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> But the ancient Christians did observe
both dayes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. In the first Ages <hi>they</hi> did as the
<hi>Apostles</hi> did; that is, 1. They observed no day
strictly as a <hi>Sabbath</hi> in the notion then in use:
2. They observed the <hi>Lords day,</hi> as a day set
apart by the Holy Ghost for Christian Worship.
3. They so far observed the <hi>Jews Sabbath mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialy,</hi>
as to avoid their scandal, and to take op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to win them.</p>
                     <p>2. But those that lived far from all Jews, and
those that lived after the Law was sufficiently
taken down, did keep but <hi>one day,</hi> even the
<hi>Lords day,</hi> as separated to holy uses: except
some <hi>Christians</hi> who differed from the rest, as
the followers of <hi>Papias</hi> did in the Millenary
point.</p>
                     <p>3. And note that even these dissenters, did still
make no question of keeping the <hi>Lords day,</hi> which
sheweth that it was on foot from the times of the
Apostles. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

therefore needeth no other defence.</p>
                     <p>And I would have you consider, whether as
Christs Resurrection was the foundation of the
Lords day; so Christs lying dead and buried in
a Grave on the seventh day Sabbath, was not a
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59348:52"/>
fundamental abrogation of it: I say not the
Actual and plenary abrogation: For it was the
Command of Christ by his Word, Spirit, or both
to the Apostles before proved, which fully made
the change: But as the Resurrection was the
Ground of the new day so his Burial seemeth
to intimate, that the day with all the Jewish
Law which it was the symbolical profession of,
lay dead and buried with him. Sure I am that
he saith, when the Bridegroom is taken from
them, then shall they fast and mourn; but he
was most notably taken from them, when he lay
dead in the Grave; And if they must <hi>fast</hi> and
mourn that day, they could not keep it as a
Sabbath, which was a day of joy Therefore
as by death he overcame him that had the power
of death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14. and as he nailed the
hand-writing of Ordinances to his Cross; so he
buried the Sabbath in his Grave, by lying buried
on that day.</p>
                     <p>And therefore the Western Churches, who
had fewer Jews among them, did <hi>fast</hi> on the
Sabbath day, to shew the change that Christs bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
intimated: Though the Eastern Churches
did not, lest they should offend the Jews.</p>
                     <p>And that the ancient Christians were not for
sabbatizing on the seventh day, is visible in the
writings of most, save the Eastern ones before
mentioned. <hi>Tertull. cont. Marcion li. 1. cap. 20.

which most others build the Lords day
upon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Let us not entangle our selves with
the ambiguities of the word [<hi>Moral</hi>] which
most properly signifieth <hi>Ethical,</hi> as distinct from
Physical, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By <hi>Moral</hi> here is meant that
which is (on what ground soever) of <hi>perpetual</hi>
or <hi>continued</hi> obligation: And so it is all one as
to ask how far it is still obligatory or in force;
To which I answer,</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>It is a part of the</hi> Law of Nature, <hi>that</hi> God
be solemnly worshipped, in families and in holy as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="88" facs="tcp:59348:54"/>
2. <hi>It is a part of the</hi> Law of Nature, <hi>that</hi> where
greater things do not forbid it, a stated time be
appointed for this service, and that it be not left
at Randome to every mans will.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>It is of the</hi> Law of Nature, <hi>that</hi> where
greater matters do not hinder it, this day be one
and the same in the same Countreys; yea, if it may
be through the world.</p>
                     <p>4. <hi>It is of the</hi> Law of Nature, <hi>that</hi> this day be
not so rarely as to hinder the ends of the day, nor
yet so frequently as to deprive us of opportunity
for our necessary corporal labour.</p>
                     <p>5. <hi>It is of the</hi> Law of Nature, <hi>that</hi> the holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of this day be n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t hindered by any corporal
work, or fleshly pleasure, or any unnecessary thing
which contradi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>teth the holy ends of the day.</p>
                     <p>6. <hi>It is of the</hi> Law of Nature, <hi>that</hi> Rulers,
and in special Masters of families, do take care
that their inferiours thus observe it.</p>
                     <p>In all these points the fourth Commandment
being but a transcript of the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi>
which we can yet prove from the <hi>nature of the
reason</hi> of the thing, the <hi>matter</hi> of it continueth
(not as Jewish, but) as <hi>Natural.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>7. Besides all this, when no man of himself
could tell, whether one day in <hi>six</hi> or <hi>seven</hi> or
<hi>eight</hi> were his duty to observe, God hath come
in, and 1. By <hi>Doctrine</hi> or <hi>History</hi> told us, that he
<hi>made the world in six dayes,</hi> and <hi>rested the seventh.</hi>
2. By <hi>Law;</hi> and <hi>bath commanded one day in seven
to the Jews;</hi> by which he hath made known <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequential<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>y
to all men, that one day in seven is the
fittest proportion of time.</hi> And the case being
thus <hi>determined</hi> by God, by a <hi>Law to others,</hi> doth
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59348:54"/>
consequentially become a <hi>Law to us,</hi> because it
is the determination of <hi>Divine Wisdom;</hi> unless it
were done upon some reasons in which <hi>their</hi>
condition <hi>differeth</hi> from <hi>ours.</hi> And thus the
Doctrine and Reasons of an abrogated Law,
continuing, may induce on us an obligation to
duty. And in this sense the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may be said still to bind us to <hi>one day in
seven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But in two points the obligation (even as to
the <hi>Matter</hi>) ceaseth. 1. We are not bound to
<hi>the seventh day,</hi> because God our Redeemer who
is Lord of the Sabbath, hath made a change.
2. We are not bound to a <hi>Sabbath</hi> in the <hi>old no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
that is, to a <hi>day of Ceremonial Rest for it
self required;</hi> but to a day to be spent in <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Worship.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And though I am not of their mind who
say, that the <hi>seventh day</hi> is not commanded in
the fourth Commandment, but a <hi>Sabbath only;</hi>
yet, I think that it is evident in the words,
that the <hi>Ratio Sabbati,</hi> and the <hi>Ratio diei sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timi</hi>
are distinguishable: And that the <hi>Sabbath</hi>
as a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> is <hi>first</hi> in the precept, and the
<hi>particular day</hi> is there but <hi>secondarily,</hi> and so
<hi>mutably;</hi> as if God had said, <hi>I will have a
particular day set apart for a holy Rest, and for
my Worship, And that day shall be one in seven,
and the seventh also on which I rested from my
works.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus I have said as much as I think
needful to satisfie the considerate about the
day: Again professing 1. That I believe that
he is in the right that maketh Conscience of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59348:55"/>
the Lords day only. 2. But yet I will not
break Charity with any Brother that shall in
tenderness of Conscience keep both dayes; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in times of prophaness when few will be
brought to the true observation of one. 3. But
I think him that keepeth the seventh day on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and neglecteth the Lords day, to sin against
very evident light, with many aggravations.
4. But I think him that keepeth no day (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
professedly, or practising contrary to his
profession; whether on pretence of avoiding
Superstition, or on pretence of keeping <hi>every
day</hi> as a Sabbath) to be far the worst of all.
I shall now add somewhat to some appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
Questions.</p>

                     <p>Quest. 1. <hi>When doth the Lords day begin?
Answ.</hi> 1. If we can tell when
<hi>any day</hi> beginneth, we may know when <hi>that</hi>
beginneth. If we <hi>cannot,</hi> the necessity of our
ignorance, will shorten the trouble of our scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
by excusing us.</p>
                     <p>2. Because the Lords day is not to be kept
as a <hi>Jewish Sabbath</hi> ceremoniously, but the
<hi>Time</hi> and the <hi>Rest</hi> are here commanded sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serviently
for the <hi>work sake,</hi> therefore we have
not so much reason to be scrupulous about
the <hi>hours</hi> of <hi>beginning and ending,</hi> as the Jews
had about their Sabbath.</p>
                     <p>3. I think he that judgeth of the beginning
and ending of the day, according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
estimation of the Countrey where he liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
will best answer the ends of the Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For he will still keep the same <hi>proportion</hi>
of time; and so much as is ordinarily allowed
on <hi>other dayes for work,</hi> he will spend this day
in <hi>holy works;</hi> and so much in <hi>rest</hi> as is used to
be spent in <hi>rest</hi> on other dayes; (which may
ordinarily satisfie a well informed Conscience)
And if any extraordinary occasions (as jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neying
or the like) require him to doubt of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59348:56"/>
any hours of the night, whether they be part
of the Lords day or not, 1. It will be but his
<hi>sleeping</hi> time, and not his <hi>worshipping time,</hi>
which he will be in doubt of: and 2. He will
avoid all <hi>scandal</hi> and <hi>tempting</hi> others to break
the day, if he measure the day by the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
estimate:</hi> whereas if the Countrey where
he liveth do esteem the day to begin at <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setting,</hi>
and he suppose it to begin at <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,</hi>
he may be <hi>scandalous</hi> by doing that
which in the common opinion is a violation
of the day. If I thought that this short
kind of solution, were not the fittest to afford
just quietness to the minds of sober Christians
in this point, I would take the pains to scan
the Controversie about the true beginning of
dayes: But left it more puzzle and perplex,
than edifie or resolve and quiet the Conscience,
I save my self and the Reader that trouble.</p>

                     <p>I. The day being separated or set apart for

                     <p>II. The principal work of the day is, the

us, that in these <hi>holy Assemblies</hi> principally, the
day was spent by the ancient Christians. They
spent almost all the day together.</p>
                     <p>3. It is not only to be spent in holy exercises,
but also in <hi>such special</hi> holy exercises as are sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to the purposes of the day. That is, it
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59348:57"/>
is a day of Commemorating the whole wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>
of our <hi>Redemption;</hi> but especially the <hi>Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
of Christ. Therefore it is a day of <hi>Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving</hi>
and <hi>Praise;</hi> and the special services <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>
it must be <hi>Laudatory</hi> and <hi>Joyful</hi> exercises.</p>
                     <p>4. But yet because it is <hi>sinners</hi> that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to their work, who are not yet fully deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
from their sin and misery, these <hi>praises</hi>
must be mixed with penitent Confessions, and
with earnest Petitions, and with diligent Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the will of God.</p>
                     <p>More particularly, the publick exercises of
the day are 1. Humble and penitent Confessions
of sin. 2. The faithful and fervent prayers of
the Church. 3. The Reading, Preaching and
Hearing of the Word of God. 4. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the Church in the Lords Supper.
5. The <hi>Laudatory Exhortations</hi> which attend it.
And the <hi>singing and speaking of the praises</hi> of
our Creator and Redeemer and Sanctifier; with
<hi>joyful Thanksgiving</hi> for his wonderful benefits.
6. The seasonable exercise of holy Discipline on
particular persons, for comforting the weak,
reforming the scandalous, casting out the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately
impenitent, and absolving and receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the penitent. 7. The Pastors blessing the
people in the name of the Lord. 8. And as an
appurtenance in due season, Oblations or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions
for holy and Charitable uses, even
for the Church and Poor, which yet may be put
off to other dayes, when it is more convenient
so to do.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Qu.</hi> But who is it that must be present in all
these exercises?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="95" facs="tcp:59348:57"/>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Where there is <hi>no Church</hi> yet called,
the <hi>whole day</hi> may be spent in <hi>Preaching to,</hi> and
<hi>teaching</hi> the <hi>unconverted Infidels:</hi> But where there
is a <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>no other persons</hi> mixt, the whole
exercises of the day must be such as are fitted to
the state of the <hi>Church.</hi> But where there is
<hi>a Church and other persons</hi> (Infidels, or impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
ones) with them, the day must be spent
proportionably in exercises suitable to the good
of both; yet so that <hi>Church-exercises</hi> should be
the <hi>principal</hi> work of the day. And the ancient
laudable practice of the Churches was, to <hi>Preach</hi>
to the <hi>Infidel auditors</hi> and <hi>Catechumens</hi> in the
<hi>morning,</hi> on such Subjects as were most suitable
to them, and then to dismiss them, and retain
the <hi>faithful</hi> (or baptized) only; And to <hi>Teach
them</hi> all the <hi>Commands of Christ;</hi> To <hi>stir them up</hi>
to the Joyful commemoration of Christ and his
Resurrection, and to sing Gods praises, and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate
the Lords Supper with Eucharistical ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments
and joy. And they never kept
a Lords day in the Church, without the Lords
Supper; In which the bare administration of the
signes was not their whole work; but all their
Thanksgiving and Praising exercises, were prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
then used, and connexed to the Lords
Supper; which the Liturgies yet extant do at
large express.</p>
                     <p>And I know no reason but thus it should be
still; or at least but that this course should be
the ordinary celebration of the day.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Qu.</hi> But seeing the Sabbath was instituted in the
beginning, to commemorate the work of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
must that be laid by now, because of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59348:58"/>
of the work of our Redemption?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> No: Our Redeemers work is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
us to the acknowledgement and Love of
our Creator. And the Commemoration of our
Redemption fitteth us to a holy acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Almighty Creator in his works:
These therefore are still to go together; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their several proper places: Even as the
Son is the way to the Father, and we must never
separate them in the exercise of our Faith, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
or Love. A Christian is a sanctified Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher:
And no man knoweth or acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Gods works of Creation and Providence
aright, in their true sense, but he that seeth God
the Creator and Redeemer, the Beginning, the
Governour and the End of all. Other Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. How did the Christians in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Churches? They met in the morning, and
often (as far as I can gat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>er) parted not till
night, (And when they did go home between the
Morning and Evening Service, it was but for a
little time.)</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> Then they made it a fast and not a festival.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> It was not the use then to eat dinners
in those hot Countreys; much less three meals
a day, as we do now. And they accounted it a
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59348:58"/>
sufficient feasting, to feast once, at Supper, which
they did at the first all together at their Church-meeting,
with the Sacrament; But afterward
finding the inconvenience of that they feasted at
home, and used only the Sacrament in the
Church: which change was not made without
the allowance of the Apostles; <hi>Paul</hi> saying,
1. <hi>Cor. 11. Have ye not houses to eat and drink
in? or despise ye the Church of God?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. I further answer that the work of the day
being done according to the primitive use, it will
be no excessive labour to the Minister: Because in
the Celebration of the Lords Supper, he is not still
in one continued speech, but hath the intermission
of Action, and useth shorter Speeches which do
not so much spend him. And the <hi>people</hi> bear a
considerable part, to wit, in Gods praises, which
were spoken then in their laudatory tone, and are
now uttered by the singing of Psalms (which
should not be the least part of the work.) And
though their manner of singing was not like ours,
in <hi>Rithmes</hi> and <hi>Tunes mel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>diously,</hi> (as neither
were the Hebrew, Greek or Latine Poems so
sung;) but as most think, more like to our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral
singing, or saying; yet it followeth not
that this is the best way <hi>for us,</hi> seeing use hath
made our Tunes and Meeter, and way of singing
more meet for the ends to which we use them,
that is, for the chearful consent of all the
Church; Neither should any think that it is <hi>a
humane unlawful invention,</hi> and a sinful <hi>change,</hi>
to turn the old way of singing (used in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
times and long after) into ours; For the
old way of singing was not a <hi>Divine institution,</hi>
                        <pb n="98" facs="tcp:59348:59"/>
but a <hi>use;</hi> and several Countreys had their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
uses herein: And God commandeth us but to
<hi>Praise</hi> him, and <hi>sing Psalmes,</hi> but doth not tell
us what <hi>meeter</hi> or <hi>tunes</hi> we shall use, or manner
of singing, but leaveth this to the use and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
of every Countrey: And if our way
and tunes be to us by custome more <hi>convenient</hi>
than those of other Nations in Scripture times,
we have no reason to forsake them, and return
to the old (Though yet the old way is not to be
judged a thing forbidden.) And we see that
custome hath so far prevailed with us, that many
thousand Religious people, do cheerfully sing
Psalmes in the Church in our Tunes and way,
who cannot endure to sing in the Cathedral or
the ancient Scripture or primitive way, nor to
use so much as the Laudatory Responses.</p>
                     <p>3. And I further answer that every Church
should have more Ministers than one, as the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Churches had besides their Readers; and
then one may in speaking ease another.</p>
                     <p>4. But lastly I answer, that These circumstances
being alterable according to the state of Countreys
&amp; Conveniences, I do not discommend the custome
of our Countrey, and of most Christian Churches
in our times, in making an intermission, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
home to dinner; as being fittest to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
And then there remaineth the less force
in the objection, as to the weariness of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
or the people.</p>
                     <p>I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> to say more of the publick Church-performances,
having described them all in a
small Book called <hi>Vniversal Concord,</hi> and having
exemplified all except. Preaching, in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59348:59"/>
Liturgie given in to the Bishops at the
<hi>Savoy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Only here, I will answer them, who object
much that</hi> the Ancient Churches spent not the whole
day in exercises of Religion, nor farbad other exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises
out of the time of publick worship, because we
read of little other observation of it by them, but
what was done in the publick Assemblies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. We find that they took it to be a
sanctified or <hi>separated day;</hi> And they never
distinguish, and say, that <hi>Part of the day only</hi> was
separated and sanctified to such uses. If they did,
<hi>which part</hi> is the sanctified part of the day? what
houres were they which they thought thus sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated?
But there is no such distinction or limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
in the writings of the ancient Doctors.
2. What need you find much mention, what
they did out of the time of publick Worship,
when they spent <hi>all the day</hi> frequently at first, and
almost all the day in after times (with small in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termission)
in publick Worship? Do <hi>you</hi> stay
but as long at Church as they did, even almost
from Morning till Night, and then you will find
little time to Dance or Play in. But yet, 3. There
want not Testimonies that they thought it unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to spend <hi>any part</hi> of the day, in unnecessary
diversions from holy things, as Dr. <hi>Young</hi> hath
shewed.</p>
                     <p>III. So much of the day as can be spared from
publick Church-worship, (and diversions of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
should be next spent most in <hi>holy family-exercises.</hi>
And in those unhappy places where the publick
worship is slenderly and negligently performed, (on
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59348:60"/>
some small part only of the day) or not at all,
or not so as it is lawful to joyne in it, (as in Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
Worship, &amp;c.) there <hi>Family worship</hi> must
take up most of the day: And in better places, it
must take up so much as the publick Worship
spareth.</p>
                     <p>And here the summ of holy exercises in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
is this (which having elsewhere directed
you in, I must but briefly name.)</p>
                     <p>1. To see that the Family <hi>rise as early</hi> on this
day as on others, and make it not a day of <hi>sleep</hi> and
<hi>idleness:</hi> And not to suffer them to <hi>violate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane</hi>
or <hi>neglect</hi> the day, by any of the sins here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
named.</p>
                     <p>2. To call them together before they go to
the solemn Assembly, and to <hi>Pray with them</hi> and
<hi>praise God,</hi> and if there be time, to read the
Scripture, and tell them what they have to do in
publick.</p>
                     <p>3. To see that Dinner and other common em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
make no longer an intermission than
is needful; And to advise them that at their
<hi>meat</hi> and <hi>necessary business,</hi> they shew by their
<hi>holy speeches,</hi> that their minds do not forget the
day, and the employments of it.</p>
                     <p>4. To <hi>sing Gods praises with them,</hi> if there be
time, and bring them again together to the
Church-assembly.</p>
                     <p>5. When they return either to take some
account of them what they have learned, or to
call them together to pray for a blessing on what
they have heard, and to sing praises to God,
and to urge the things which they have heard
upon them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="101" facs="tcp:59348:60"/>
6. At Supper to behave themselves soberly
and piously: And after Supper to shut up the
day in Prayer and Praise; And either then or
before, either to examine or exhort inferiours,
according as the case of the persons and families
shall require (For in some Families it will be best
on the same day to take an account of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting,
and to Catechize them: And in other
Families that have leisure, other daies may be
more convenient for Catechising and Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that the greater works of the Lords day may
not be shortened.)</p>
                     <p>IV. So much of the day as can be spared from
<hi>publick</hi> and <hi>family</hi> worship, must be spent in
<hi>secret, holy duties:</hi> such as are, 1. Secret Prayer.
2. Reading of the Scriptures and good Books.
3. Holy Meditation; 4. And the secret Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of bosome friends. Of which I further
adde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. That where <hi>publick</hi> or <hi>family worship</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be had (as in impious places) there secret
duties must be the chief, and make up the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of others. And it is a great happiness of
good Christians who have willing minds, that
they have such secret substitutes and supplies;
That they have Bibles and so many good Books
to read, That they may have a friend to talk with
of holy things; But much more that they have
a God to go to, and a Heaven to Meditate on,
besides so many Sacred Verities.</p>
                     <p>2. That my judgement is, that in those places
where the publick Worship taketh up almost all
the day, it is no sin to attend on it to the utmost,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59348:61"/>
and to omit all such Family and secret exercises
as cannot be done, without omission of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.
And that where the publick exercises
allow but a little time at home, the Family du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
should take up all that little time, except what
some shorter secret Prayers or Meditations may
have, which will not hinder family duties. And that
it is a sinful disorder to do otherwise. Because
the Lords day is principally set apart for <hi>publick
worship;</hi> And the more <hi>private or secret</hi> is as it
were included in the publick: Your Families are
at Church with you; The same Prayers which
you would put up in secret, you may (usually)
put up in publick, and in Families: And it is a
turning Gods Worship into a Ceremony and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,
to think that you must necessarily put up
the same Prayers in a Closet, which you put up
in the Family or Church, when you have not
time for both. (Though when you have time,
<hi>secret prayer,</hi> hath its proper advantages, which
are not to be neglected.) And also, what secret
or family duty you have not time for on that day,
you may do on another day, when you cannot
come to Church Assemblies. And therefore it
is an Errour to think that the day must be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
in equal proportions, between <hi>Publick,
Family,</hi> and <hi>Secret Duties:</hi> Though yet I think
it not amiss that some <hi>convenient time</hi> for <hi>Family</hi>
and <hi>Secret</hi> duties be left on that day; but not so
much as is spent in publick, nor nothing
neer it.</p>
                     <p>If any shall now object, [<hi>I do not believe that we
are bound to all this ado, nor so to tire out our selves
in Religious exercises: Where is all this ado com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
us?</hi>]</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="103" facs="tcp:59348:61"/>
I answer, 1. I have proved to you that in
Nature and in Scripture set together as great a
proportion of time as this for holy exercises is
required.</p>
                     <p>2. But O what a Carnal unthankful heart; doth
this objection signifie? What, do you account
your Love to God, and the Commemoration of
his Love in Christ, a <hi>toile?</hi> What if God had only
given you <hi>leave,</hi> to lay by your worldly business,
and idle talk and Childish play, for one dayes
time, and to learn how to be like Christ and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
and how to make sure of a Heavenly Glory,
should you not gladly have accepted it as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
benefit? O what hearts have these
wretched men that must be constrained by <hi>fear</hi>
to all that is good, and holy, and spiritual; and
<hi>will have</hi> none of Gods greatest mercies, unless
it be for fear of hell (And they shall never <hi>have
them indeed</hi> till they <hi>love them!</hi>) What hearts
have those men, that had rather be in an Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house,
or a Play-house, or asleep, than to be in
heart with God? That can find so much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in jesting and idle talking and foolery, that
they can better endure it, than to peruse a Map
of Heaven, and to read and hear the Sacred
Oracles! Who think it a toile to praise their
Maker and Redeemer, and a pleasure to game
and dance and drink! Who turn the glass upon
the Preacher, and grudge if he exceed his hour;
and can sit at a Tavern or Alehouse, or hold on
in any thing thats vain, many hours and never
complain of weariness! Do they not tell the
world what enemies they are to God, who love a
pair of Cards, or Dice, or Wanton Dalliance,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59348:62"/>
better than his Word and Worship? Who think
six dayes together little enough for their worldly
work and profit, and one day in seven too much
to spend in the thoughts of God and life Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal?
Who love the dung of this present World,
so much better than all the joyes above, as that
they are weary to hear of Heaven above an hour
at a time, and long to be wallowing in the dirt
again? Is it not made by the Holy Ghost, a mark
not only of <hi>wicked</hi> men, but of men <hi>notoriously
wicked,</hi> to be <hi>Lovers of pleasures more than of
God?</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 4.</p>
                     <p>O Sinners, that in these workings of the
wickedness and malignity of your hearts, you
would at last but know your selves! Is it not the
<hi>Carnal mind that is thus at enmity to God, and
neither is nor can be subject to his Law,</hi> Rom. 8.
6, 7, 8? Which will you take to be your friend;
Him that <hi>loveth your</hi> company, or him that is
a weary of it, and is glad when he hath done
with you, and is got away? What would you
think of Wife, or Child, or Friend, if they should
reason as you do, and say, <hi>What Law doth bind

God make it my duty to go to it? If one would
give you <hi>Money or Land,</hi> you would scarcely
ask, How prove you that I am bound to take
it? You would be glad of Leave, without
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59348:62"/>
Commands. If the King should say to you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Ask what you will, and I will give it you, you
would not say, Where am I bound of God
to ask? And when God saith, Ask and it shall
be given you, you say, How prove you that I
am bound to ask? You can sing ribbald Songs,
and Dance without a Command; You can Feast,
and Play, and Prate, and Sleep, and Loyter in
idleness without a Command; But you cannot
learn how to be saved, nor praise your. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
without a Command. A Thief can
Steal, a Fornicator can Play the Bruit, a Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
can be Drunk, an Oppressour can make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
hateful to the Oppressed, not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Law, but against it? But you cannot Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
in God, nor live one day together in his
Love and Service, without a Law, no nor
<hi>with</hi> it neither. For because you had rather
not Love him, it is certain that you <hi>do not</hi>
Love him: And because you had rather play
than pray, and serve the flesh than serve your
Maker; it is a certain sign that you <hi>do not</hi>
serve him, with any thing which he will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
as Service. For while he hath not your
hearts, he hath nothing which he accepteth.
Your Knee and Tongue only is forced against
your will to that which you call serving him:
But your Hearts or Wills cannot be forced.
When you had rather be elsewhere, and say
When will the Sermon and Prayer be done,
that I may be at my Work or Play? God taketh
it as if you were there where you had rather be.</p>
                     <p>I pray you deal openly, and tell me, you
that think a day too long for God, and are
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:59348:63"/>
weary of all holy work, What would you be
doing that while, if you had your choice? Is it
any thing which you dare say <hi>is better?</hi> Dare
you say, that <hi>playing</hi> is better than Praying, and
a Piper or Dancing is better than praising God
with Psalms? Or that your Sleep, or Games, or
Chat or Worldly business is better than the
Contemplation of God and Glory! And will
those deceivers of the people also say this,
who teach them that it is a tedious uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
thing, to serve God so long? I think
they dare not speak it out. If they dare, let
them not grudge that they must be for ever
shut out of Heaven, where there will be nothing
else but holiness. But if you dare not say so,
Why will you choose the worse, before the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
Why will you be weary of well doing, that
you may do ill? Why are you not more weary
of every thing than of holiness, unless you
think every thing better than holiness.</p>
                     <p>Especially those men, 1. Whose <hi>judgement</hi>
is for <hi>will-worship,</hi> should not ask, where is there
a Command, for any good which they are
willing of. But doth not this shew that you
had rather there were <hi>no Command</hi> for it?
Be judges your selves. 2. And they that are
for making the Churches a great deal more
work than God hath made them, (O what
abundance hath Popery made; and what a
multitude of new Religious particles!) me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
should not for shame say that God hath
tired them out, and made them too much
work already? Do you cry out, What a
weariness is this one day, when you
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:59348:63"/>
would adde of your own such a multitude of
more dayes, and more work?</p>
                     <p>Yet though I talk of doing it willingly if
you had no <hi>forcing Law</hi> of God, but <hi>bare leave</hi>
to receive such Benefits, my meaning is not
that God hath left any <hi>such things indifferent</hi>
or made them only the matter of <hi>Counsels</hi> and
not of <hi>Commands:</hi> For he hath made it our
<hi>duty</hi> to receive our <hi>own benefits,</hi> and to do that
which tendeth to our <hi>own good</hi> and Salvation.
But if it <hi>had been so,</hi> that we had only leave to
receive so great mercies without any other pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
for refusing, than the <hi>loss</hi> of them, it
should be enough to men that Love themselves,
and know what is for their good. Much more
when commands concurr.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. X.</head>
                     <head type="sub">How the Lords day should not be spent: Or, What
is unlawful on it?</head>
                     <p>AS to the resolving of this Question also,
I would wish for no greater advantage on
him that I dispute with, but that he be a man
that <hi>Loveth God and Holiness,</hi> and knoweth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of the difference between things temporal
and things Eternal; and knoweth what is for
the good of his soul; and preferreth it before
his body; and hath an appetite to relish the
delights of Wisdom, and of things most excellent
and Divine. And that he be one that knoweth
his own necessities, and repenteth of his former
loss of time; and liveth in a daily preparation
for death; that is, that he be a real Christian; And
then by all this it will appear, how the <hi>Lords day
must not be spent;</hi> or what things are <hi>unlawful
to be done thereon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I. Undoubtedly it must not be spent in <hi>wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness:</hi>
In <hi>gluttony or drunkenness, chambering or
wantonness, strife or envying,</hi> or any of those
works of the flesh, which are <hi>at all times</hi> sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
An <hi>evil</hi> work is most unsuitable to a <hi>holy
day.</hi> And yet, alas, what day hath more ryot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59348:64"/>
and excess, of meat, and drink, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonness,
and sloth, and lust, than it?</p>
                     <p>II. It ought not to be spent in our worldly
businesses, which are the labours allowed us on
the six dayes; unless <hi>Necessity</hi> or <hi>Mercy</hi> make
them at any time become such duties of the
Law of Nature, as Positives must for that time
give place to. For how is it a day separated to
holy employments, if we spend it in the common
business of the world? It is the great advantage
that we have by such a separated day, that we
may wholly call off our minds from the world,
and set them on the world to come, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
them in holy communion with God and
his Church, without the interruptions and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions
of any earthly cogitations. A di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
mind doth never perform any holy work,
with that integrity and life, as the nature of it
requireth. Heavenly contemplations are never
well managed with the intermixture of divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wordly thoughts: So great a work as to
converse in Heaven, to be rapt up in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of the Divine perfections, to kindle a
fervent Love to God, by the contemplation of
his Love and Goodness, to triumph over sin
and Satan with our triumphing glorified Head,
to Commemorate his Resurrection, and the
whole work of our Redemption with a lively
working faith, doth require the whole heart, and
will not consist with aliene thoughts, and the
diversion of fleshly employments or delights.
Nay, had we no higher work to do, than to
search our hearts, and lament our sins, and beg
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59348:65"/>
for mercy, and learn Gods Word, and treat
with our Redeemer about the saving of our
souls, and to prepare for death and judgement,
surely it should challenge all our faculties, and
tell us that voluntary diversions, do too much
savour of impiety and contempt. It is the great
mercy of God, that we have leave to lay by
these clogs and impediments of the soul, and to
seek his face with greater freedom, than the
incumbrances of our week day labours will
allow us. No slave can be so glad of a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths
ease from his sorest toil and basest drud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery,
as a believer should be to be released from
his earthly thoughts and business, that he may
freely, entirely and delightfully converse with
God.</p>
                     <p>III. The Lords day must not be spent in
tempting, diverting, unnecessary recreations, or
pleasures of the flesh. 1. For these are as
great an impediment to the holy employment
of the soul, as worldly labours, if not much
more. It is easier for a man to be exercised in
heavenly cogitations, at the Plow or Cart, or
other such labours of his place and Calling,
than at Bowls, or Hunting, or Cards, or Dice, or
Stage-playes, or Races, or Dancing, or Bear-bait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
or Cock-fights, or any such sensual sports.
I need no proof of this to any man, that hath
himself any experience, of the holy employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of a believing soul, or that ever knew
what it was to spend one Day of the Lord
aright; And no proof will suffice them that have
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59348:65"/>
                        <hi>no</hi> experience, because they know not effectually
what it is that they talk of.</p>
                     <p>2. We find that even on other daies, the worst
men are most addicted to these sports, and are
the greatest pleaders for them, and that the more
they use them the worse they grow; yea that the
times of using them are frequently the times of
the eruption of many heynous sins. I have lived
in my Youth in many places where sometimes
<hi>Shews</hi> or uncouth Spectacles have been their
sports at certain seasons of the year, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
Morrice-dancings, and sometimes Stage-playes,
and sometimes <hi>Wakes</hi> and <hi>Revels;</hi> And
all men observed that these were the times of the
most flagitious crimes, and that there was then
more drunkenness, more fighting, more horrid
Oathes and Curses uttered than in many weeks at
other times; Then it was that the enraged sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualists
did act the part of furious Devils, in
scorning and reviling all that were soberer and
better than themselves, and railing at those that
minded God and their everlasting state, as Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,
Puritans and Hypocrites; Then it was that
they were ready in their fury, if they durst, to
assault the very persons and houses of them that
would not do as they did. Whatever is done
in such Crowdes and Tumults, is done with the
impetuosity of rage and passion, and with the
greatest audacity, and the violation of all Laws
and regulating restraints. As many waters
make a furious stream, and great fires where
much fuel is conjunct do disdain restraint, and
quickly devour all before them; so is it with the
raging folly of Youth, when voluptuous persons
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:59348:66"/>
once get together, and their lusts take fire, and
they fall into a torrent of profuse sensuality.
Yea those that at other times are sober, and when
they come home do seem of another mind, yet
do as the rest when they are among them, and
seem as bad and furious as they: As we see among
the <hi>London</hi> Apprentices on the day called <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tides
Tuesday,</hi> or <hi>May day,</hi> when they once get
out together and are in motion, they seem all
alike, and those that are most sober and timerous
alone, in the rowt are heightened to the audacity
of the rest; And as in an Army the sight of the
multitude, and the noise of Drums and Guns,
puts valour into the fearful; and they will go
on with others, that else would run away from a
proportionable single combate and danger; And as
Boyes at School that fear to offend singly, yet fear
not to barr out their Master in a combination
when all concurr; so all seem wicked in a
crowd and rowt of wicked persons; And sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality
and licentiousness is not the smallest part
of wickedness.</p>
                     <p>O how unfit is Youth in such a Crowd, to
think of God, or Eternity, or Death; or to hear
the sober warnings of a Preacher, in comparison
of what the same persons be, when they are at
Church, and Congregated purposely to hear
Gods Word. Go among them and try them
then, with any grave and wholesome Counsel:
Ask them whether they are penitent Converts,
and whether they are prepared for another world.
Try what answer they will give you, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they will not deride you more than at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time? I would those that write and plead
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59348:66"/>
for this under the name of <hi>harmless recreations,</hi>
would go amongst them sometimes with sober
Counsel, and learn to be wise by their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience;
that their errours might not be of such
pernicious consequence to mens souls as it hath
been. Reason it self hath no place or audience
in the noise of youthful furious lusts. They
will laugh at <hi>Reason,</hi> as well as at <hi>Scripture;</hi> and
scorn <hi>sobriety,</hi> as well (though not so much)
as <hi>holiness.</hi> If even in the meetings of grave
persons, it have ever been observed that indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual
persons are apt to be carryed by the stream,
and otherwise than their talk importeth at other
times when they are single, what wonder if it be
so in evil with unbridled youth?</p>
                     <p>If you say that the <hi>Law forbiddeth rowts and
riots, and it is no such unruly assemblies that we
defend.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Disclaim not the <hi>name</hi> only while you
defend the thing. Be not like them that say,
We <hi>perswade</hi> men to <hi>voluntary untruths</hi> but not
to <hi>lying; to break their Vows and Oathes in law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
matters,</hi> but not to perjury; to kill those
that anger them, but not to murder; to take
other mens goods by force, but not to rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Is not a <hi>Wakes</hi> and <hi>Revels</hi> and <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice-Dances,</hi>
and Dancing-assemblies, and Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
and Stage playes, and the like, such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
as I am speaking of. Do you limit
Dancers, and Players to any numbers? I speak
not of the Laws. I am too much unacquainted
with them. If they say, that above <hi>four meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
to Dance or Drink on the Lords day shall be
accounted a Conventicle or unlawful Assembly,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59348:67"/>
it is more than ever I heard of, But I am speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the common practice of the contrary, and
of those that ordinarily defend it, and labour to
bring both Godly Ministers, and sober people, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the scorn of foolish preciseness and superstition,
because they would hinder the sin and ruine of
the people. If you will allow them to assemble
for their Dancings, <hi>Shews,</hi> and Sports, you will
encourage them to break the Laws both of God
and Man, though you pretend never so much
care that they be observed. You may as well
allow them to be Drunk, and when you have
done, forbid them to break Gods Laws and the
Kings in their Drunkenness. There are few in
such sportful Assemblies that are not Drunk with
Concupiscence, and whose reason is not drowned
in voluptuousness and vain imaginations. Let
those Divines (if I may so call the Advocates of
Sensuality and Sin) which are otherwise mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
give us leave to oppose against all their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
and the false names of <hi>harmless recreations,</hi>
but, 1. Our own experience, who in our youth,
have alwaies found such sports and revelling As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies
to be corrupters of our minds, and
temptations to evil, and quenchers of every holy
motion, and enemies to all thats good. 2. The
experience of the visibly corrupted undone sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
youth, that are round about us, in all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
where we have lived. 3. And the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

as any Sacred Writer) Eccl. 7. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
<hi>It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to the
house of feasting: For that is the end of all men,
and the living will lay it to his heart: Sorrow is
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59348:67"/>
better than laughter; for by the sadness of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
the heart is made better. The heart of the
wise is in the house of mou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ning, but the heart of
fools is in the house of mirth</hi> (I pray you do not
say I raile at you by the reciting of these words,
nor that I diminish the honour of the Reverend
Advocates for <hi>Wakes</hi> and Lords day Sports and
Dancings:) <hi>It is better to hear the rebuke of the
wise, than for a man to hear the Song of fools.
For as the sound of thorns under a pot, so is the
laughter of the fool.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>3. Moreover, these sports, and pleasures, and
riotings, are worse than Plowing and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
on the Lords day, because (as they are
more adverse to spiritual and heavenly joyes,
so) they do <hi>less good</hi> to recompense the
hurt. A <hi>Carpenter,</hi> a <hi>Mason,</hi> a <hi>Plowman, &amp;c.</hi>
may do <hi>some good</hi> by his unlawful, unseasonable
labour; some one may be the better for it: But,
Dancing, and Sports, and Gaming, do no good
but hurt. They corrupt the Fantasie; They im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print
upon the <hi>Thinking faculty,</hi> so strong an
inclination to run out after such things; and
upon the Appetite so strong a list and longing for
them, that carnality is much encreased by them,
Mortification hindred; Concupiscence gratified;
the flesh prevaileth, the spirit is quenched; and
the soul made as unfit for heavenly things, as a
School-boy is for his Book, whose heart is set
upon his play: Yea abundance more; as Nature
by Corruption is more averse to spiritual things,
than to the things of Art or Nature.</p>
                     <p>4. These Dancings, and Playes, and Wakes
and other riotous sports, are a strong temptation
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59348:68"/>
also to them that are not of the riotous societies,
but have convictions on their hearts, that they
have greater and better things to mind.
Without accusing others, I may say that I know
this by bad experience. I cannot forget, when
my Conscience was against their courses, and
called me to better things, how hardly when I
was young, I passed by the Dancing,
and the Playing Congregations; and
especially when in the Passage I must bear their
scorn.</p>
                     <p>And I was one Year a School-master, and
found how hard it was for the poor Children, to
avoid such snares, even when they were sure to be
whipt the next day for their pleasures.</p>
                     <p>5. And those Riots and Playes are injurious to
the pious and sober persons who dislike them.
For it is <hi>they</hi> that shall be made the Rabbles Scorn,
and the Drunkards Song; Besides that the noise
oft times annoyeth them when they should be
calmely serving God. And they are hindered
from governing and instructing their Families,
while their Children and Servants are thus
tempted to be gone, and their hearts are all the
while in the playing place. Never did a hungry
dog more grudge at his restraint from meat,
than Children and young Servants usually
grudge, to be Catechised, or kept to holy exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises,
when they hear the pipe, or the noise of
the licentious multitude in the Streets. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
forget, that in my Youth in those late times,
when we lost the labours of some of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
Godly Teachers, for not Reading pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
the Book for Sports and Dancing on the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59348:68"/>
Lords dayes, one of my Fathers own Tenants
was the Town Piper, hired by the Year (for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Years together) and the place of the Dancing
Assembly was not an hundred yards from our
door; and we could not on the Lords day, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
read a Chapter, or Pray, or sing a Psalm, or
Catechise or instruct a Servant, but with the noise
of the Pipe and Taber, and the Whootings in the
Street, continually in our Ears; And even
among a tractable people, we were the common
Scorn of all the Rabble in the Streets, and called
Puritans, Precisians and Hypocrites, because we
rather chose but to read the Scriptures, than to
do as they did (Though there was no favour of
any Non-conformity in our Family.) And
when the people by the Book were allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Play and Dance, out of publick <hi>Service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,</hi>
they could so hardly break off their Sports,
that many a time the Reader was fain to stay
till the Piper and Players would give over; And
sometimes the Morrice-Dancers would come into
the Church, in all their Linnen and Scarfs and
Antick Dresses, with Morrice-bells jingling at
their leggs. And as soon as Common Prayer
was read, did haste out presently to their Play
again. Was this a Heavenly Coversation? Was
this a help to holiness and Devotion? or to the
Mortification of fleshly Lusts? Was this the way
to train up youth in the Nurture and Admonition
of the Lord? And were such Assemblies like to
the primitive Churches? Or such Families go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
Christianly and in the fear of God? O
Lord set wise and holy Pastors over thy poor
Flocks, that have learnt themselves the holy
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59348:69"/>
Doctrine which they Preach, and who love, (or
at least abhorr not) the service and imitation of
a Crucified Christ, and the practice of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
which they themselves profess.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> But poor labouring people must have some
recreation, and they cannot through their poverty
have leisure any other day.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. A sad Argument to be used by them
that by racking of Rents do keep them in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty.
They that cannot live without all those
superfluities, which requireth many hundred
pounds a Year to maintain them must for this
gratifying pride and fleshly lusts, set such bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains
to their poor Tenants, as that they confess
they cannot live, without taking the Lords day
to recreate them from the toile and weariness of
their excessive labours: And will not God judge
such self-condemning oppressours as these are?</p>
                     <p>2. But is this an Argument fit for the mouth
of a Minister or any Christian, who knoweth
how much the soul is more worth than the body?
and Eternity more valuable than the pleasures of
this little time? If Poverty deny the people li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to play on the week dayes, doth it not as
much deny them liberty to Pray, and to read the
Scriptures, and to learn their Catechisms, and the
Word of God? Surely it better beseemeth any
man that believeth another life, a Heaven and a
Hell, to say, Poor Labourers have so little time,
to Learn, to Meditate, to Read, to Pray, on the
week dayes, that if they do not follow it close
upon the Lords day, they are like to perish in
their ignorance: (For if the Gospel be hid, it is
hid to them that are lost, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3.) which do
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59348:69"/>
you think it better to leave undone, if one of
them must be left undone? Whether the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Gods Word, or the Pleasures and Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the flesh?</p>
                     <p>3. It is either their <hi>Bodies</hi> or their <hi>Minds,</hi> that
need Recreation. When the Body is tired with
toilesome labour, it is <hi>ease,</hi> rather than toilesome
Dancings or Plays, that are fit to recreate it.
Or else God will be charged with mistake in the
reasons of the ancient Sabbath. But if it be
the <hi>Mind</hi> that needeth <hi>recreation,</hi> why should not
the Learning of Heavenly truth, and the Joyful
Commemoration of our Redemption, and the
foresight of Heaven and the Praises of God, be
more delightful than the noise of Thornes under
a pott; even than the laughter and sport of fools,
or than the Dancings and Games that now you
plead for? But the truth is, It is not the Minds
of poor labouring men, that are over-workt and
tired on the week dayes, but it is their <hi>bodies:</hi>
And therefore there is no Recreation so suitable
to them, as the ease of the body, and the holy
and joyful exercise of the mind, upon their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,
their Redeemer, and their Everlasting
Rest.</p>
                     <p>4. But if you will needs have daies of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and sinful sports and pleasures for them, let
Landlords abate their Tenants as much Rent, as
one dayes vacancy from labour in a Month or a
Fortnight will amount to, or let the Common
`Saints dayes, which of the two are more at mans
disposal, be made their sporting dayes, and rob
not their souls of that one weekly day, which
God hath separated for his Worship.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="120" facs="tcp:59348:70"/>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> But there are Students, and Lawyers, and
Ministers, and Gentlemen, whose labour is most
that of the Brain, and not the Plow-mans bodily
toile; and these have need of bodily Recreation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> And there are few of these so poor
but they can take their bodily Recreation on the
week dayes: And many of them need as much
the whole Lords day for their souls Edification
as any others: And no one that knoweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self 
will say that he needs it not. If any men
need remission of Studies, and bodily Exercise
it is Ministers themselves: And is it themselves
that they plead for Sports and Dancing for?
Would they be companions of the vain in such
like vanities?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> But the mind of man is not able to endure
a constant intension and elevation of devotion all the
day long without recreation and intermission; And
putting men upon more than they can do, will but
hinder them; when a little recreation will make them
more fresh and fervent when they return to God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> O what an advantage is it to know by
experience what one talketh of? And what an
inconvenience to talk of Holiness and Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
by hearsay only! 1. To poor people that
have but one day in seven, that one day should
not seem too long. 2. If it be from a Carnal
enemity to God and spiritual things, shortness
and seldomeness will be no Cure. But they have
need rather to be provoked to diligence till they
are cured, than to be indulged in that averseness
and floth, which till its cured will prevail, when
you have done your best against it. 3. But if it
be a weariness of the flesh; as the Disciples when
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59348:70"/>
they slept while Christ was Praying; or a weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
through such imperfection of Grace and
Remnant of Carnality, which the sincere are lya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to, then giving way to it will increase it, and
resisting it is the way to overcome it. 4. How
many necessary intermissions are there, which
confute this pretense of <hi>weariness?</hi> Some time is
taken up in dressing; And some with poor Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
in waiting on their Masters and Mistrisses,
and in preparing Meat and drink; some in going
to Church and coming home; some in eating,
usually more than once; some in preparing again
for sleep; besides what Cattle and by-occasions
will require? And is the remainder of <hi>one day</hi> in
a week yet too much for the business which we
are Created, preserved, and Redeemed for, and
on which our endless life dependeth? O that we
knew what the Love of God is? and what it is
to regard our souls according to their worth!
Would not a soul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that loveth God rather say,
<hi>Alas, how short is the Lords day? How quickly is it
gone? How many interruptions hinder my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light?</hi>
Shall I think a Week short enough for
my worldly labours,) and one day (thus par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled)
too long to seek the face of God? I see
blind Worldlings and sensualists can be longer
unwearied at Market, in their Shops and Fields,
especially when their gain comes in; and at
Cards and Dice, and Bowling and idle Prating,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And shall I be weary so soon of the most
noble and necessary Work, and of the sweetest
pleasures upon Earth?</p>
                     <p>An Hypocrite that draweth near to God but
with the lips, whilest his heart is far from him, as
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59348:71"/>
he never truly seeketh God, so he never truly
findeth him, and hath none of the true spiritual
delights of holiness, nor ever feeleth the pleasure
of exercising his <hi>Love to God</hi> by the help of <hi>faith,</hi>
in the <hi>hopes of Heaven:</hi> And therefore no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
if he be weary of such unprofitable, sapless
and unpleasant work, as his dead formalities and
affectations are. But it is not so with the sincere
experienced Christian, who serving God in <hi>spirit</hi>
and <hi>truth,</hi> hath <hi>true</hi> and <hi>spiritual</hi> recreation,
pleasure and benefit in and by his Service. And
therefore we see that the holy experienced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
are still averse to these sensual diversions,
and do not think the Lords da<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or his Service
too long. And O Christian what happy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
in such controversies have you, in your
holy sincerity and sweet experience?</p>
                     <p>5. But yet I am not such a stranger to man,
to my self or others, as to deny that our
naughty hearts are inclined to be weary of well
doing: But mark what a cure God in Wisdom
and mercy hath provided for us: As it is but
one day in seven which is thus to be wholly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
with God, and as much of this day is
taken up with the bodily necessaries aforesaid;
so for the rest, God appointeth us variety of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises,
that when we are weary of one, another
may be our recreation. When we have <hi>heard</hi>
we <hi>must pray,</hi> and when we have <hi>prayed</hi> we must
<hi>hear</hi> again: We must Read, we must Sing and
speak Gods Praises, we must celebrate the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial
of Christs death in the Sacrament; we
must Meditate; we must Conferr, we must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
our Families: And we have variety of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59348:71"/>
subjects for each of these. As a student that is
weary hath variety of Books and Studies to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create
his mind; so hath every Christian variety
of holy employment on the Lords day. And
all of it excellent profitable and delightful!</p>
                     <p>Christian, believe not that Minister or Man what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he be, that telleth thee that Christs Yoak is
heavy, or that his Commandments are grievous.
Hath he done so much to deliver us from the
strait Yoak, the heavy Burden, and the grievous
Commandments? and now shall we accuse him
of bringing us under a toylesome task? Is it a
toile to love or count your money? to love and
look upon your Corn and Cattle? to love and
converse with your Friend? to feast your Body
on the pleasantest Food? If not, why should it
be a toile to any but a wicked heart, to spend a
day in Loving God, and hearing the Messages of
his Love to us, and in the foresight and foretasts
of everlasting love.</p>
                     <p>Caviller, come but unto Christ, and cast off the
wearisome, toilesome burden of thy sin, and
Satans drudgery, and take Christs Yoak and
Burden on thee, and learn of him, and try then
whether his daies and work be grievous. Come
and spend but a day in <hi>Loving God,</hi> as thou dost
in <hi>talking</hi> of him, and try whether Love, and
the holiest Love, be a wearisome work. But if
thou wilt make a Religion of all Shell and no
Kernel, all Carkass and no Life, like that which
the <hi>Jansenists</hi> charge the Jesuites with, that say,
<hi>We are bound to love God but once in four or five
years, or once in all our lives,</hi> no wonder if thou be
weary of such a <hi>Religion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="124" facs="tcp:59348:72"/>
6. But I will tell them that are the Teachers
of the people, an honester way to Cure the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
weariness, than to send them to a Piper or
to a Play to cure it. Preach with such life and
awakening seriousness; Preach with such grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
holy eloquence, and with such easie method,
and with such variety of wholesome matter, that
the people may never be aweary of you. Pour out
the rehearsal of the Love and benefits of God,
open so to them the priviledges of faith, and the
Joyes of hope, that they may never be aweary.
How oft have I heard the people say of such as
these, <hi>I could hear him all day and never be aweary!</hi>
They are troubled at the shortness of such Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
and wish they had been longer. Pray
with that Heavenly life and fervour as may rap
up the souls of those that joyne with you, and
try then whether they will be aweary: Praise
God with that joyful alacrity which beseemeth
one that is ready to pass into Glory, and try
whether this will not Cure the peoples weariness.</p>
                     <p>Misunderstand me not. I am now speaking
to none but guilty hypocrites, and not to any
faithful holy Ministers; And to such I say, when
you have done nothing but coldly read over the
publick Prayers, or as coldly and crudely added
your own, and tired the hearers, with a dry, a
sapless, lifeless, unexperienced discourse, and then
send them as a wearied people, to dancing and
sports for a needful recreation, is this like the
work of a Pastour of Souls. When you have
cryed down <hi>other mens</hi> Praying and Preaching,
and then tell the people that the <hi>Praying</hi> and
<hi>Preacing</hi> which you recommend to them as
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59348:72"/>
better, will not digest well, without a Dance or
Recreation after it, to expel the peoples weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
is not this to disgrace your own Prayers
and Preaching which you before commended to
them? And when you have done, if after this
you speak against others for their long Praying,
and for so much Preaching and Hearing, as if
they never had enough, is not this to <hi>commend</hi>
what you <hi>discommend?</hi> and to tell the people
that those mens Praying and Preaching whom
you revile, is such as doth <hi>not weary their</hi> Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours;
when <hi>yours</hi> is such, as will tiremen, if it
be long, or if they be not Recreated after it with
a Piper, a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>idler, or a Dance? O that the <hi>Ithacian</hi>
Bishops of the World, and all the Clergie of
their mind, would at least hear <hi>Hooker</hi> in the
Preface to his <hi>Eccles. pol.</hi> how little their cause is
beholden to such Patrons, and how well it might
spare them!</p>
                     <p>For my own part, as my flesh is weak, so my
heart is too bad, too backward to these Divine
and Heavenly works! And yet I never have time
to spare. God knoweth that it is my daily
groans, <hi>How great is work, yea and how sweet; and
how short is the day, the week, the year! How
quickly is it night! How fast do weeks and years roll
away!</hi> And shall any man that is called a Minister
of Christ, perswade poor <hi>Labourers</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi>
who have but one day for retirement from the
world, to converse with God without distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that <hi>this one day</hi> is <hi>too long,</hi> and that their
work must be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ased by carnal sports? Nay shall
a man that would be called a Minister or a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
perswade men against all the experience
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59348:73"/>
of the World, that the diversions and interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of a <hi>Dance</hi> or <hi>May game,</hi> or a Race or a
Comedie, will dispose their minds to return to
God with more Heavenly alacrity and purity
than before, or than variety of holy exercises
will do? Or rather, are we constrained to say
(though it displease) that Hypocrites are all for
Imagery and hypocritical Religion; and that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he be at Church or at home, in Praying or in
drinking and sensuality and voluptuosness, a
Worldling is every where a Worldling still, and
an hypocrite is an hypocrite still; And it is not
his Book or Pulpit that maketh him another
man. And that as the man is, such will be his
Work. <hi>Operari sequitur esse.</hi> And that the
Jesuites are not the only men in the world, that
would make a Religion to suite mens lusts, and
would serve Satan and the flesh, in the livery of
Christ. But I fear I have been too long on this
objection.</p>
                     <p>IV. The <hi>Lords day</hi> must not be spent in <hi>Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:</hi>
not in unnecessary sleep, or in vain walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or vain talking, or long dressings, or too long
feastings, or any thing unnecessary which divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
our souls from their Sacred seasonable work.
It is not a Jewish Ceremonious Sabbath of bodily
rest which we are to keep: But it is a day of holy
and spiritual works: of the needfullest work in all
the world: To do that which is ten thousand
times more necessary and excellent, than all our
labours and provision for the flesh. And if no man
hath time to spare on the week day, but he that
knoweth not aright what it is to be a Christian or a
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59348:73"/>
man or why God maintaineth and continueth
him in the world; What shall we think of them
that can find time to spare on the Lords own day,
and can walk and idle away the most precious of
all their time? If it be folly to cast away your
Silver, it is not wisdom to cast away your gold.
O that God would but open mens eyes, to see
what is before them, and how near to Eternity
they stand, and awaken mens sleepy sensual souls,
to live as men that do not <hi>dream</hi> of another
world, but unfeignedly believe it; and then a little
reasoning would serve turn to convince them,
that the Lords day should be spent in the duties
of serious holiness, and not in Idleness, or unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
works or sports.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> But by all this you seem to cast a
great reproach on <hi>Calvin, Beza,</hi> and most of the
great Divines of the forreign Churches, who have
not been so strict for the observation of the Lords
day.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Let these things be observed by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
Reader. 1. It cannot be proved to be
most of them, that were so faulty herein as the
objection intimateth. Many of them have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
much for the holy spending of the day. 2. It
must be noted, that it is a superstitious Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
Sabbatizing which many of them write
against, who seem to the unobservant to mean
more. It is not the spending of the day in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
exercises. 3. And you must remember
that they came newly out of Popery, and had
seen the Lords day and a superabundance of other
Humane Holy dayes imposed on the Churches to
be Ceremoniously observed, and they did not all
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59348:74"/>
of them so clearly as they ought, discern the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between the Lords day and those holy
dayes or Church Festivals, and so did too pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuously
conjoine them in their reproofs of the
burdens imposed on the Church. And it being
the Papists Ceremoniousness, and their multitude
of Festivals that stood all together in their eye, it
tempted them to too undistinguishing and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate
a reformation. 4. And for <hi>Calvin</hi> you
must know that he spent every day so like to a
Lords day, in hard Study, and Prayer, and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
Writings, and publick Preaching, or
Lecturing and Disputings, either every day in the
week, or very near it, scarce allowing himself
time for his one only spare meale a day, that he
might the easilier be tempted, to make less diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in his judgement between the Lords day
and other dayes, than he should have done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
to plead for more recreation on that day for
others, than he took on any day himself. 5. And
then his followers having also many of the same
temptations, were apt to tread in his steps
through the deserved estimation of his worth and
judgement and lest they should seem to be of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
minds. But as <hi>England</hi> hath been the
happyest in this piece of reformation, so all men
are unexcusable that will encourage idleness, sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality
or neglect of the important duties of the
day.</p>

                     <head type="sub">What things should not be Scrupled as unlawful on
the Lords day.</head>
                     <p>As I have told you the Lords day is not a
Sabbath in the Jewish sense, or a day of
<hi>Ceremonious Rest,</hi> but a Day of Worshiping our
Creator and Redeemer with thankful Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morations
and with holy Joy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And a day of
vacancy from such earthly things as may be any
hinderance to this holy work; so now I must
resolve the Question first in the <hi>General,</hi> that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
lawful at another time is unlawful on this
day, which hath not the <hi>Nature</hi> of an Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to <hi>the holy duties</hi> of the day; unless it be
accidentally on the account of <hi>scandal</hi> or ill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
unto others, or disobeying the Laws of
Magistrates, or crossing the Concord of the
Churches, or such like. Therefore hence I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
these particular resolutions following.</p>
                     <p>I. It is not unlawful to be at such <hi>bodily</hi> or
<hi>mental</hi> labour as is needful to the spiritual duties
of the day. If the <hi>Priests in the Temple</hi> (saith
Christ) <hi>did break the Sabbath and were blameless</hi>
(that is, not the Command of God to them for
keeping the Sabbath, but the external Rest of the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:59348:75"/>
Sabbath, which was commanded to others with
an exception to their case,) we may well say
that it is no sin, for a Minister now to spend <hi>his
strength</hi> in laborious Preaching and Praying; or
for the people to travel as far as is needful, to
the Church Assemblies: nor do we need to tye
our selves to a Sabbath dayes journey, (that is,
according to the Scribes 2000 Cubits, which is
3000 feet, and <hi>quinque stadia:</hi>) It is lawful to go
many miles when it is necessary to the work of
the day.</p>
                     <p>II. It is not unlawful to be at the labour of
dressing our selves somewhat more ornately or
comely than on another day. Because it is sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to the rejoycing of a Festival. But to
waste time needlesly in curJosity, and proud at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring,
to the hinderance of greater things, is
detestable.</p>
                     <p>III. It is not unlawful to dress meat, even in
some fuller and better manner than on other
dayes; Because it is a Festival, or day of Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving.
And it is a vain self-contradiction of
some men, who think that another day of
Thanksgiving is not well kept, if there be not
two feasting meals at least, and yet think it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
to dress one on the Lords day: But yet
to make it a day of Gluttony, or to waste more of
the day in eating or dressing meat than is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the spiritual work of the day, which is
our end; or to make our selves sleepy by ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or to use our servants like Beasts, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for our bellies, with the neglect of their
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59348:75"/>
own souls; or to pamper the flesh to the satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and irritation of its lusts; All this is to be
detested.</p>
                     <p>IV. It is not unlawful to do the necessary
works of mercy to our selves or others, to man
or beast; <hi>Those which must be done, and cannot
be delayed without more hurt than the doing of
them will procure</hi> (for that is the description of a
necessary work.) As to eat and drink and cloth
our selves, and our Children; To carry meat
to the poor that are in present necessity; To
give or take Physick; and to go for advice to
the Physician or Surgeon: To travel upon a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
of importance and necessity; To quench a
fire; or prop a house that is about to fall; To
march or fight in a necessary case of Warr; To
Saile or labour at Sea in cases of necessity; To
Boat-men over a River that go to Church; To
pursue a Robber, or defend him that is assaulted;
To pull a man out of fire or water; To dress a
mans sores, or to give Physick to the sick; To
pull an Oxe or Horse or other Cattle out of a pit
or water; To drive or lead them to water, and
to give them meat: To save Cattle, Corne or
Hay from the sudden inundations of the Sea, or
of Rivers, or from Floods; To drive Cattle or
Swine out of the grounds where they break in
to spoile; such necessary actions are not unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
but a duty; It being a Moral or Natural
precept, which Christ twice bid the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
Pharises learn [<hi>I will have mercy and not
Sacrifice.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="132" facs="tcp:59348:76"/>
And it is not only works of necessity to a
<hi>mans life,</hi> that are here meant by <hi>necessary works<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi>
But such also as are <hi>necessary</hi> to a smaller and
lower end or use.</p>
                     <p>And yet it is not <hi>all such necessity</hi> neither that
will allow us to do the thing. Otherwise a
Tradesman or Plowman might say that his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
is necessary to the <hi>getting</hi> or <hi>saving</hi> of this
or that small commodity; I shall be a loser if I
do not work. And on the other side, if it were
only a necessity for life, limbs or livelihood that
would allow us labour, than it would be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to dress Meat, and to drive Cattle out of the
Corn, and many such things before mentioned;
And then it would be lawful to give meat only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59348:76"/>
be lost; when the Swine, or Hens, or Horses, or
Oxen, may easily recover the hunger or abstinence
of a day? What must be done in such cases as
these?</p>
                     <p>I answer, 1. It is necessary to know that
where God hath not made particular determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
yet general Laws do still oblige us.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And that Christian Prudence is necessary to
the right discarning how far our actions fall
under those General Laws of God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That he that will discern these things must
be a man, that truly understandeth, valueth and
loveth the true Ends and Work of the Lords
day, and not a man that hateth it, or careth not
for it; And a man that hath a right estimate also
of those outward things, which stand in question
to be medled with. And he must be one that
hath no superstitious Jewish conceits of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Rest of the day: And he must be one that
looketh, not only to one thing or a few, but to
<hi>all things</hi> how numerous soever which the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of his case dependeth on.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And because very few are such, it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
that those few that are such, be Casuists and
Advisers to the rest, and that the more ignorant
consult with them (especially if they be their
proper Pastors) as they do with Physicians and
Lawyers for their health and their estates.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. It must be known that oft times the Laws
of the Land do interpose in such cases; And if
they do determine so strictly, as to forbid that
which else would to some be lawful, they must
be obeyed; Because bad men cannot be kept
from doing ill by excesses unless some good men
be hindered by the same Laws from some things
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59348:77"/>
that are to them indifferent, nay possibly eligible,
if there were no such Law.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. And accordingly the case of <hi>Scandal</hi> or
<hi>Temptation</hi> to others, that will turn our Example
to their sin, must be considered in our Practice.
Yea it is not only things meerly Indifferent that
we must deny our liberty in, to prevent anothers
fall, but oft times that which would else be a <hi>Duty</hi>
may become a sin, when it will scandalize ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or tempt him to a farr greater and more
dangerous sin. As it may be my duty to speak
some word, or do some action, as most useful
and beneficial, when there is nothing against it;
And yet if I may foresee that another will turn
that speech or action to his ruine, to the hatred
of piety, or to take occasion from it to exercise
cruelty upon other Christians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it may become
my hainous sin. So it must here be considered,
who will know of the Action which you do?
and what use they are like to make of it?</p>
                     <p n="7">7. And a little publick hurt must be more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
than more private benefit; And the hurt
of a mans soul cannot be countervailed by your
corporal Commodities.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. These things being premised, I suppose that
the great Rule to guide you in such undetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Circumstances is the <hi>Interest</hi> of <hi>the End;</hi> All
things must be done to the Glory of God, and to
Edification. A truly impartial prudent man can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
by comparing all the circumstances whether
his action (as if it were carrying in Endangered
Corn) were likely to do more good or harm? On
one side you must put in the ballance the value of
the thing to be saved; your own necessity of
it; the poors need of it; and Christs command,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59348:77"/>
                        <hi>Gather up the fragments that nothing be lost:</hi> on
the other side you must consider, how far it will
hinder your spiritual benefit and duty; and how
far the example may be like to encourage such as
will do such things without just cause; And so
try which is the way of <hi>Gods honour</hi> and <hi>your own</hi>
and <hi>your neighbours good;</hi> and that is the way
which you must take (As in the Disciples rubbing
the ears of Corn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) For the Rule is, that <hi>your
labour is then lawful and a duty, when in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a truly judicious person, it is like to do more
good than hurt; And it is then sinful when it is like
to do more hurt than good.</hi> Though all cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
this, yet (as far as I know) this is the true
rule, to judge such actions by. As for them
that suppose our Lords day to be under the same
Laws of Rest with the Jewish Sabbath, and so
think that they have a readyer way to decide
these doubts, I will not contend with them, but
I have told you why I am not of their mind.</p>
                     <p>V. From hence I further conclude, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
there are some actions which bring some <hi>little
benefit,</hi> but yet are no apparent hinderances of
any of the work of the day, it seemeth to me too
much Ceremoniousness, and too ungospel-like,
to trouble our own or other mens Consciences,
by concluding such things to be unlawful. If
one have a word to speak of some considerable
worldly business, which may be forgotten if it be
not presently spoken; or if I meet one with
whom I must speak the next day about some
worldly business, and if I then wish him not to
come speak with me, I must send a great way
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:59348:78"/>
to him afterwards, I will not say that it is a sin
to speak such a word. I will first look at a mans
positive duties on the Lords day, how he hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and readeth, and prayeth, and spendeth his
time, and how he instructeth and helpeth his
Family; And if he be diligent in seeking God,
(<hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6.) and ply his Heavenly business, I
shall be very backward to judge him for a word
or action about wordly things that falls in on
the by without any hinderance to his spiritual
work. And if another speak not a word of any
common thing, and yet do little in spiritual
things, for his own or others edification, I shall
think him a great abuser or neglecter of the
Lords day. A few words about a common
thing that falleth in the way, may be spoken
without any hinderance of any holy duty: But
still we must see that it be not a scandalous
temptation to others. If I see a man that unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly
findeth some uncomely hole or rent in
his Cloaths, either pin it up, or few it up before
he goeth abroad, I will not blame him: But if he
do it so as to embolden another who useth need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly
to mend his Cloaths on the Lords day, it
will be a sin of scandal. If I see one cut some
undecent stragling haires before he go forth, I
will not blame him: But if he do it before one
who will be encouraged by it, to be barbed need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly
on that day, he will offend. And so in
other cases.</p>
                     <p>VI. By these same Rules also we may judge
of <hi>Recreations</hi> on the <hi>Lords day.</hi> The Recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the mind must be the various holy em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59348:78"/>
of the day. No bodily Recreations
are lawful which needlesly waste time, or hinder
our duty, or divert our minds from holy things,
or are a snare to others. Unless it be some weak
persons whose health requireth bodily motion,
few persons need any other than holy
recreations on that day. I know no one man
that so much needeth it as my self, who these
twenty years cannot digest one dayes meat, unless
I walk, or run, or exercise my body before it, till
I am hot or sweat; And therefore necessity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
me to walk or fast: But I do it privately
on that day, left I tempt others to sin. But I
will not censure one whom I see walking at fit
houres, when for ought I know he may be taken
up in some fruitful Meditation. But if persons
will walk in the Streets or Fields in idleness, or
for vain delight, or discourse, as if the day were
too long for them, and they had no business to
do for their souls, this is not only a sin, but a
very ill sign of one that is senseless of his souls
necessity and his duty.</p>
                     <p>VII. To read History, Philosophy, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
things, unnecessarily on the Lords day, is
a sinful diversion from the more spiritual work
of it; and unsuitable to the appointed uses of
the day (much more Romances, Play Books, or
idle stories:) Yea or those parts of <hi>Divinity it
self,</hi> which are less practical and useful to the
raising of Thankful and Heavenly affections.
But yet sometimes such other matter may fall in,
at a Sermon, or Conference, or in Meditation,
which will require a present satisfaction in some
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59348:79"/>
point of History, Philosophie, or controversal
Divinity, which may be subserviently used to
Edification, without sin. Here therefore we
must judge prudently.</p>
                     <p>VIII, A thing that may be lawful singly in
it self, unless it be of great necessity is unlawful
when he that serveth us in it is drawn or encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
to make a trade of it. As to use a Barber
to cut your hair; or a Tailor to mend your
Cloaths, or a Coblar to mend your Shooes: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
if <hi>you</hi> may use him; so may others as well
as you, and so he will follow his Calling on the
Lords day. And yet I dare not say, if when you
are to travel to Church, you find your Shooes or
Boots by breaking something, to make you unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of going out, but you may get them mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
privately, where it may be done without this
inconvenience. And though Cooks and Bakers
should not be <hi>unnecessarily</hi> used in their trade,
yet is it not <hi>alwaies</hi> unlawful, but sometimes very
well. Because as <hi>one servant</hi> in the <hi>Kitchin</hi> may
be used to dress meat for <hi>all the family,</hi> so one
<hi>Baker</hi> or <hi>Cooke</hi> may serve <hi>many families,</hi> and save
ten times as many persons the labour which else
they must be at; And perhaps with easier and
quicker dispatch than others. The trade of the
Apothecary, Surgeon and Physician is ordinarily
used but for necessity.</p>
                     <p>IX. There is no sufficient avoidance of such
abuses, but by careful foresight, and prevention
and preparation the week before; which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must be conscionably done.</p>

                  <div n="12" type="chapter">

                     <head>CHAP. XII.</head>
                     <head type="sub">Of what importance the due Observation of the
Lords day is.</head>
                     <p>THese singular benefits of keeping the Lords
day aright, should make all that Love God,
or holiness or the Church, or their own or other
mens souls, take heed how they grow into a neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
or abuse of it; much more that they plead
not for such negligence or abuse.</p>
                     <p>I. The due observation of the Lords day is
needful to <hi>keep up the solemn worship of God,</hi> and
<hi>publick owning and honouring him</hi> in the world:
If all men were left to themselves, what time
they would bestow in the worshipping of God,
the greatest part would cast off all, and grow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Atheisme or utter prophaneness; And the rest
would grow into confusion. And if all Princes
and Rulers or Churches in the world were left to
their own wills to appoint the people on what
dayes to meet, some Kingdoms and Churches
would have one day, in eight, or nine, or ten, or
twenty, and some only now and then an hour,
and some one day, and some another, and some
next to none at all. For there is no one univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Monareh on Earth to make Laws for them
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59348:80"/>
all (whatever the Pope or his nominal-General
Councils may pretend to:) And they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
all come to any reasonable agreement volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
among themselves. Therefore the Light
of Nature telleth us, that as a day is meet and
needful to be stated, so it is meet that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
the true Universal Monarch should determine
of it; which accordingly he hath done. And
this is the very hedge and defensative of Gods
publick Worship. When he hath made a Law
that <hi>one whole day in seven</hi> shall be spent in it,
men are engaged to attend it.</p>
                     <p>O what a happy acknowledgement of God
our Creatour and Redeemer is it, and an honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his blessed name, when all the Churches
throughout all the World, are at once praising
the same God, with the same praises, and hearing
and learning the same Gospel, and professing the
same faith, and thankfully commemorating the
same benefits! The Church is then indeed, like
an Army with Banners. And were it not for
<hi>this dayes</hi> observation, alas, how different would
the case be? And what greater thing can man be
bound to, than thus, to keep up the solemn
acknowledgement and worship of God and our
Redeemer in the world?</p>
                     <p>II. The due Sanctification of the Lords day,
doth tend to <hi>make Religion Vniversal,</hi> as to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
and individual persons, which else would
be of narrower extent. When all the world
are under a Divine obligation, to spend one day
every week in the exercises of Religion, (and
superiours see to the performance of their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59348:80"/>
obedience to this Law,) it will make men
to be in some sort Religious whether they will
or not: Though they cannot be <hi>truly</hi> Religious
against their will, it will make them <hi>visibly reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious.</hi>
Yea Gods own Law, if mans did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
would lay arrawe on the Consciences of
most, who believe that there is a God that made
that Law. And the weekly Assemblies keep up
the knowledge and profession of the Christian
faith, and keep God and Heaven in the peoples
remembrance, and keep sin under constant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes
and disgrace: And were it not for this,
Heathenisme, Infidelity and prophaneness would
quickly overspread the world. The Lords day
keepeth up the Christian Religion in the
World.</p>
                     <p>III. The lamentable <hi>Ignorance</hi> of the <hi>genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
in the world, doth require the strict and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
observation of the whole Lords day.
<hi>Children and Servants,</hi> and ordinary <hi>Countrey peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
yea and too many of <hi>higher</hi> quality, are so
exceeding Ignorant of the things of God and
their Salvation, that all the constantest diligence
that can be used with them, in Preaching, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting,
Catechizing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will not overcome it
with the most. The most diligent Masters of
Families lament it, how Ignorant their Families
are when they have done the best they can. Let
those that plead for dancing and sporting away
much of the day, but do like men that do not
secretly scorn Christianity, nor despise their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
souls, and let them but try what measure
of knowledge the bare hearing of Common
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:59348:81"/>
Prayer, yea and a Sermon or two with it, will
beget in their servants, if the rest of the day be
spent in sports; and let them judge according
to experience. If ever knowledge be propagated
to such, and families made fit to live like Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
it is likest to be by the holy improvement
of this day, in the diligent teaching and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the substance of Religion, and in the Sacred
exercises thereof.</p>
                     <p>IV. The great Carnality, Wordliness and
Carelesness of the most, and their great averse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to the things of God, doth require that they
be called and kept to a close and diligent improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Lords day. Whatever unexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
or carnal persons may pretend, that such
constant duty so long together will make them
worse and more averse, reason, experience and
Scripture are all against them. If there be some
backwardness at the first, it is not sports and
idleness that will cure it, but resisting of the
slothful humour, and keeping to the work. For
there is that <hi>in Religion</hi> that tendeth to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
mens <hi>averseness</hi> to Religion; And it must be
overcome by <hi>Religion,</hi> and not by <hi>playing</hi> or
<hi>idleness,</hi> if ever it be overcome. It is want of
knowledge and experience of it, which maketh
them loath it or be weary of it: when they have
<hi>tryed</hi> it more and <hi>know it</hi> better, they will (if
ever) be reconciled to it. Six dayes in a Week
are a sufficient diversion. Apprentices, and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pils
and School-boyes will hold on in learning,
though they be averse; And you think not all
the six dayes too much to hold them to it.
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:59348:81"/>
A School-boy must learn daily, eight or nine
hours in a day; and yet some wretched men
(yea Teachers) would perswade poor souls that
must learn how to be saved or perish for ever,
that less than eight hours one day in seven,
is too much to be spent in the needfullest, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellentest
and pleasantest matters in all the
World.</p>
                     <p>If you say that the <hi>sublimity</hi> or <hi>difficulty</hi>
maketh it wearisome, I answer, that Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
do much longer hold on in <hi>harder</hi> specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</p>
                     <p>If you say <hi>Divinity</hi> being unsuitable to carnal
minds, their sick Stomachs must take no more
than they can digest, I answer, 1. Cannot a
Carnal Preacher for his gain, and honour, and
fancy, hold on all the year in the study even of
Divinity, perhaps eight or ten hours every day in
the week? And may not ignorant people be
brought <hi>one day</hi> to endure to be taught as
long? 2. That which you call <hi>Digesting,</hi> is but
<hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> and <hi>believing,</hi> and <hi>receiving</hi> it:
And one truth tendeth to introduce another;
And he that cannot learn with an hours labour
may learn more in two. 3. And it is hearing
and exercise that must cure their want of appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite.
Experience telleth us, that when people
take the liberty of playes, and sports, and idleness
for a recreation, they come back with much more
want of Love to holy exercises, than they that
continue longer at them. Gratifying sloth and
sensuality, increaseth it, and increaseth an averse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to all that is good; For who are more averse
than they that are most voluptuous? If ever
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:59348:82"/>
people be made seriously holy, it is a due obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the whole Lords day, that is like to
bring them to it (I mean observing it in such
<hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>seeking</hi> duties as they are capable
of, till they can do better) For when the mind
<hi>long dwelleth</hi> on the <hi>truth,</hi> it will sink in and
work; And many strokes will drive the nail to
the head.</p>
                     <p>Let the Adversaries of this day and diligence
but observe, And if true experience tell not the
World that more souls are Converted on the
Lords dayes than on all other dayes besides, and
that <hi>Religion best prospereth</hi> both as to the <hi>Number</hi>
and the <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>serious Holiness</hi> of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours
of it, where the Lords day is carefully
sanctified, rather than where Idleness and play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
do make intermission, than I will confess that
I am uncapable of knowing any thing of this
nature by experiences. But if it be so, fight not
against the common light.</p>
                     <p>V. The <hi>Poverty, Servitude</hi> and <hi>worldly necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
of the most, do require a strict observation
of the whole Lords day. <hi>Tenants,</hi> and <hi>Labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
Carters</hi> and <hi>Carryers,</hi> and abundance of
Tradesmen are so poor, that they can hardly
spare any other considerable proportion of time:
much less all their Children and Servants, whose
<hi>subjection,</hi> with their Parents and Masters <hi>poverty,</hi>
restraineth them. Alas, they are fain to rise
early and hasten to their work, and scarce have
leisure to eat and sleep as nature requireth: And
they are so toiled and wearied with hard la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
that if they have at night a quarter of an
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:59348:82"/>
hour to read a Chapter and Pray, they can scarce
hold open their eyes from sleeping. What time
hath the Minister then to come and teach them
(if we had such Ministers again as would be at
the pains to do it?) And what time have they to
hear or learn? You must teach them on the Lords
day, or scarcely at all. Almost all that they must
learn, must be <hi>then</hi> learnt.</p>
                     <p>I deny not but in those former years, when the
Law forbad me not to Preach the Gospel, the
people came to me on the week day, house by
house, and also that they Learned much in their
shops while they were working. But, 1. It came
to each Families turn but one hour, or little more
in a whole Year (For about fourteen families
a week so Catechized and instructed, did no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
bring their course about.) 2. And our people
were mostly Weavers, whose labour was not like
the Plowmans, Masons, Carpenters, Carryers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
to take up their thoughts; but they could lay a
Book before them and read, or meditate, or
Discourse to Edification whilest they were work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
But this is not the case of the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
                     <p>And let any sober man but consider, whether
with people so ignorant and averse as the most
are, should he be never so diligent on the Lords
day, the six dayes intermission be not a great
cooling of affection, and a great delayer of their
growth in knowledge; when they are like by
the weeks end to forget all that they had learned
on the Lords day. What then would these poor
people come to, if the Lords day it self must be
alsoloitered or played away?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="146" facs="tcp:59348:83"/>
VI. The tyranny of many Masters maketh the
Lords day a great mercy to the world: For if
God had not made a Law for their Rest and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
abundance of worldly impious persons,
would have allowed them little <hi>Rest</hi> for their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and less opportunity for the good of their
souls. Therefore they have cause with great
thankfulness to improve the <hi>holy liberty</hi> which
God hath given them, and not cast it away on
play or idleness.</p>
                     <p>VII. The full improvement of the Lords
dayes doth tend to breed and keep up an able
faithful Ministry in the Churches (on which the
preservation and glory of Religion much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth.)
When there is a <hi>necessity of full Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
performances</hi> imposed on Ministers, they are
also necessitated to <hi>prepare</hi> themselves with answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<hi>abilities</hi> and fitness. But when no more is
required of them, but to read the Liturgie, or
to say a short and dry Discourse, they that know
no more is necessary (to their ends) are so
strongly tempted to get ability and preparations
for no more, that few will overcome the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And therefore the World knoweth that in
<hi>Moscovy, Abassia,</hi> and for the most part of the
Greek and Armenian Churches, as nothing or
little more than Reading is required, so little
more ability than to Read is laboured after,
And the Ministers are ordinarily so ignorant and
weak, as is the scorn and decay of the Christian
Religion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="147" facs="tcp:59348:83"/>
VIII. Yea it will strongly encline Masters of
Families to labour more for abilities, to instruct
and Catechise their Families, and pray with them,
and guide them in the fear of God, when they know
that the whole day must be improved to the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
good of their Families. And so knowledge, abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
and family-holiness will increase: Whereas
those that think themselves under no such obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
what ignorant, profane and ungodly
families have they? because for the most part,
they are such themselves.</p>
                     <p>IX. A multitude of gross sins will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by the due observation of the Lords day.
Nothing more usual than for the sports,
riots, idleness and sensuality of that day, to be
nurseries of Oathes, Curses, Ribaldry, Fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Gluttony, Drunkenness, Frayes and Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.
And is not Gods Service better work than
these?</p>
                     <p>X. Lastly, This holy order and prosperity of
the Churches, and this knowledge and piety in
individual Subjects, will become the safety, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
order and felicity, of Kingdomes, and all Civil
societies of men. For when the people are fit but
duly to use and sanctifie the Lords day, they are fit
to use all things in a sanctified manner, and to be
an honour to their Countrey, and an ease, and
comfort to their Governours, and a common
blessing to all about them.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XIII.</head>
                     <head type="sub">What other Church Festivals or separated daies are
lawful.</head>
                     <p>I Shall conclude this Discourse with the brief
answer of this Question.</p>
                     <p>I. No sober Christian doubteth, but that some
part of every day is to be spent in Religious exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises;
And that even our earthly business must
be done with a spiritual intent and mind. And
that every day must be kept as <hi>like</hi> to the Lords
day, as our weakness, and our other duties,
which God hath laid upon us, will allow.</p>
                     <p>II. Few make any question but the whole
dayes of <hi>Humiliation</hi> and of <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> may
and must be kept upon great and extraordinary
occasions, of Judgements or of mercies. And
that many Churches may agree in these. And I
know no just reason why the Magistrate may
not (with Charity and Moderation to the weak)
impose them, and command such an agreement
among his Subjects.</p>
                     <p>III. Few doubt but the Commemoration of
great <hi>Mer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ies</hi> or <hi>Judgements</hi> may be made <hi>anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary,</hi>
                        <pb n="149" facs="tcp:59348:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and of long continuance. As the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-plot
day (<hi>Nov.</hi> 5.) is now made among
us, to preserve the memorial of that deliverance.
And why may it not be continued, whilest the
great sense of the benefit should be continued?
And so the second of <hi>Sept.</hi> is set apart for the
Anniversary humbling remembrance, of the
Firing of <hi>London.</hi> And so in divers other
cases.</p>
                     <p>IV. The great blessing of an Apostolick Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,
and of the stability of the Martyrs in their
sufferings for Christ, being so rare and notable a
Mercy to the Church, I confess I know no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why the Churches of all succeeding ages may
not keep an Anniversary day of Thanksgiving
to God for <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Stephen,</hi> as well as
for the Powder plot-deliverance. I know
not where God hath forbidden it, directly or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly.
If his instituting the <hi>Lords day</hi> were
a virtual prohibition for man to separate any
more, or if the prohibition of <hi>adding</hi> to Gods
Word were against it, they would be against
other daies of Humiliation and Thanksgiving,
especially Anniversarily; which we confess they
are not. If the reason be scandal, lest the <hi>Men</hi>
should have the honour instead of God, I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
1. An honour is due to Apostles and
Martyrs in their places, in meet subordination
to God. 2. Where the case of scandal is noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
it may become by that accident unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and yet not be so in other times and
places.</p>

V. The Devil h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>th here been a great <hi>Vndoer</hi>
by <hi>Overdoing:</hi> When he knew not how else to
cast out the holy observation of the Lords day,
with zealous people he found out the trick of
devising so many dayes called <hi>Holy dayes</hi> to set
up by it, that the people might perceive that the
observation of them all as <hi>holy,</hi> was never to be
expected. And so the Lords day was jumbled
in the heap of <hi>holy dayes,</hi> and all turned into Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony,
by the Papists and too many other
Churches in the World. Which became <hi>Calvins</hi>
temptation (as his own words make plain)
to think too meanly of the Lords day with the
rest.</p>
                     <p>VI. In the lawful observation of daies, it is
most orderly to do as the Churches do which
we live among and are to joine with.</p>
                     <p>VII. But if Church tyranny would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm
any place with over-numerous daies
(or Ceremonies which are (singly consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
lawful, we should do nothing needlesly to
countenance and encourage such usurpation.</p>
                     <p>VIII. Yet is it lawful to hear a Sermon,
which shall be Preached on a humane <hi>Holy day,</hi>
which is imposed by Usurpation. Seeing such a
a Moral duty may be done, and so great a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
received, without any approbation of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient
season.</p>
                     <p>IX. And when we think it unlawful to joyne
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:59348:85"/>
in the positive Celebration of unlawful dayes (as
the Mahometan Sabbath,) yet it may become
a duty for the civil peace and our own safety, to
obey the Magistrate in forbearing open opposition
or contempt, or working upon that day? And
so <hi>Paul</hi> justifieth himself against the Jews accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations,
that they <hi>found him not in the Temple dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
with any man, nor raising up the people,
nor in the Synagogues, nor in the City,</hi> Act. 24. 12.
unless it be when we have a special call, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
the errour which we forbear complying
with.</p>
                     <p>X. It is long agoe decided by the Holy Ghost,
<hi>Rom. 14. &amp;</hi> 15. that we must not be contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
contemptuous, nor censorious against one
another, about things of no greater moment,
than the Jewish <hi>dayes</hi> were, though some obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
them without just cause: Because the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God consisteth not in Meats, and Drinks,
and Daies, but in <hi>righteousness and peaceableness
and joy in the Holy Ghost. And he that in these
things serveth Christ, is acceptable to God (and
received by him) and approved of (wise) men,
and should be received to Communion with them,</hi>
Rom. 14. 17, 18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15. 7. We must therefore
<hi>follow after the things that make for peace, and
things wherewith one may edifie another,</hi> Rom.
14. 19.</p>
                     <p>XI. The Controversie, whether it be lawful to
separate an Anniversary day for the Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Christs Nativity, Circumcision and such
like things which were equally existent in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        <pb n="152" facs="tcp:59348:86"/>
Apostles dayes, and the reason for observing
them equal with following times, (and so the
Apostles had the same reason to have appointed
such dayes had they thought it best, as we have)
I acknowledge too hard for me to determine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
not being able to prove it lawful, I cannot own
and justifie it; And not seeing a plain prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
I will not condemn it, nor be guilty of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaceable
opposing Church Customes or Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in it, but behave my self as a peaceable
doubter.</p>
                     <p>XII. But that no earthly power may appoint
<hi>a weekly day,</hi> in commemoration of any part of
our Redemption, besides the Lords day, and so
make another separated weekly stated Holy day,
I think plainly unlawful, Because it is a doing the
same thing for one day which God hath done
already by another; And so seemeth to me,
1. An usurpation of a power not given, and
2. An accusation of Christ and the Holy Ghost,
as if he had not done his work sufficiently, but
man must come after and do it better.</p>
                     <p>But especially if such (or any day or Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny)
be by an universal Law imposed on the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Church, it is arrogant usurpation of the
Divine Authority; there being no Vicarious
Head or Monarch under Christ of all the World
or all the Church, nor any Universal Governour
who may exercise such Legislation, whether per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
or Collective.</p>
                     <p>The same I may say of any that would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
to abrogate the Lords day.</p>
                     <p>And so much shall suffice in great haste of this
subject.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="153" facs="tcp:59348:86"/>
And to thee O most Glorious and Gracious
Creatour and Redeemer, I humbly return my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned
thanks, for the unspeakable mercies which
I have received on thy day; And much more for
so great a Mercy to all thy Churches and the
World: And craving the pardon (among the
rest) of the sins which I have committed on thy
Day, I beseech thee to continue this exceeding
mercy, to thy Churches and to Me; and restore
me and other of thy Servants, to the priviledges,
and comforts of this Day; which we have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
and lost; And let me serve thee in the
Life, and Light, and Love of thy Spirit, in these
thy Holy Dayes on Earth, till I be prepared for,
and received to, the Everlasting Rest in Heavenly
Glory, <hi>Amen.</hi>

4. The great length of time
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59348:89"/>
which was spent in the holy exercises: Besides
the rest of the Worship, and breaking of Bread,
<hi>Paul</hi> Preaching till midnight: which intimateth
that such work took up the day. 5. Because it
is mentioned as a matter of their custome: They
did not assemble because <hi>Paul</hi> called them to <hi>hear
him</hi> only, as being to depart on the morrow;
But <hi>Paul</hi> assembled <hi>with them</hi> at the time of <hi>their
assembling to break Bread;</hi> And it seemeth that he
deferred his journey for that opportunity. 6. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
other Texts as joyned with this, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Church History following, do prove past
all doubt that it was the constant custome of all
the Churches so to do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj. 1 Cor.</hi> 16. 1, 2. The first day of the week,
<hi>&amp;c. gr.</hi> one of the Sabbaths. It is an ordinance to
lay aside for charitable uses; but not one word about
changing of the Sabbath.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The abolition of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> we prove
not by this Text, but by others: All that we
bring <hi>this</hi> for, is but to shew in conjunction with
others, as part of the Sacred History, that the
first day was the Churches separated day. And I
pray mark the strength of the proof, that the
Apostle did [<hi>give order that all the Churches of</hi>
Galatia <hi>as well as the Corinthians, should deposite</hi>]
their Almes on one and the same day, <hi>viz.</hi> on the
first day: Was it not enough to tie them to the
<hi>contribution,</hi> but he must tie them all <hi>to one set day
to lay</hi> it by, or deposite it? if it had not been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Churches used to assemble on this day,
and not to appear before God empty (as
Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> noteth on the Text?) Whoever
heard else that God or man tyed several Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:59348:90"/>
to one set day for the private depositing of
their own moneys afterward to be distributed?
<hi>With such Sacrifices God is well pleased;</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was ever accounted by Christians a fit work
for the sanctified day: But no other day was ever
appointed peculiarly for the set time of laying by
mens gifts of Charity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj. Rev. 1. 10. John</hi> was in the Spirit on the
Lords day. Compare <hi>Exod. 20. 10, &amp;c. Esa. 58.
13, &amp;c. Luk. 6. 5. Mark 2. 28. Mat. 12. 8, &amp;c.</hi>
And if the Scriptures be the rule to judge, resolve
whether that day be not the Lords day, of which
day, (and of which only as distinguished from the
other dayes of the week,) the Son of man is Lord.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> We are not upon a Controversie of <hi>title</hi>
or <hi>propriety,</hi> whether God <hi>be Lord of other dayes:</hi>
For so no doubt, he is <hi>Lord of all,</hi> and therefore
no more of one than another, because his propriety
in each one is <hi>absolute;</hi> And it can be no more
in any. Thus also he is absolute Lord of all
things, all places, all persons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet some
<hi>things,</hi> some <hi>places,</hi> some <hi>persons</hi> have been <hi>sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
to his service</hi> by a peculiar Dedication and
Relation; and thence have been peculiarly called
<hi>The Lords.</hi> And the Texts cited by you out of
the old Testament prove that such was the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
day Sabbath then: But not that it is so
now; or was to be so for perpetuity.</p>
                  <p>And the words of the new Testament cited
[<hi>The Son of man is Lord also,</hi> or <hi>even of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
day,</hi>] shews no more, then that it was in his
power: He giveth it as a reason for his doing
that which the Pharises counted Sabbath-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(By which he oftentimes offended them;)
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:59348:90"/>
and not as a reason of his <hi>astablishing</hi> it. And it
seemeth plainly to mean, that <hi>being</hi> but a <hi>Positive
Law,</hi> and a <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> he had power to
change it, and dispense with it, as well as with
other <hi>Positives</hi> and <hi>Mosaical Laws.</hi> As it is said,
Ephes. 1. 22, 23. <hi>he hath made him Head over all
things to the Church;</hi> not <hi>Head to all things;</hi> so
he is <hi>Lord over, or of all dayes;</hi> But all are not
<hi>separated</hi> to his Worship. As it is said, Joh.
17. 2. <hi>As thou hast given him power over all flesh,
that he should give eternal life to as many as thou
hast given him:</hi> so it may be said, he hath power
over all dayes, that he may sanctifie one to his
peculiar service, and use the rest in more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
works.</p>
                  <p>But that which we bring this text for is but to
know what day is notified to the world by this title
of <hi>The Lords day,</hi> and consequently was then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
his <hi>separated peculiar</hi> day. Now the signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of words is known but by use: They are not
<hi>Natural</hi> signes, but <hi>Arbitrary:</hi> You know not the
sense of one word of Hebrew, Greek, or Latine,
but by the History of their use, by Dictionaries,
Authors or other Tradition. Now it is unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable
to any man verst in antiquity, that all
the Churches, and Authors, Greek and Latine,
Syriack, Aethiopick, Persian, Arabick, that have
been known among us, and speak of such things,
do unanimously call the first day of the week by
the name of the <hi>Lords day,</hi> as being so called
from the beginning, even from the Apostles; And
all old expositors so interpret this present Text.
And you may as well question what day the
word <hi>Sabbath</hi> signified in the Old Testament
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:59348:91"/>
almost, as what day the name of [<hi>The Lords day</hi>]
signified in the new; Or what sort of people
they were that were called <hi>Christians</hi> first at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi>
when only one sort hath ever since been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
by that name; Even the Disciples of Christ.
The Greek, with the Syriack Translation, the
Arabick, the vulgar Latine, have all [<hi>The Lords
day;</hi>] and the Ethiopick as equipollent, hath
[<hi>the first day</hi>] And Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> (who would
find something against it if any thing were to be
found) speaking of some of late that otherwise
expound it, is so ingenious as to say (Par. 2. cap.
1. p. 37.) <hi>Touching this we will not meddle; Let
them that own it look to it: The rather since
St.</hi> John <hi>hath generally been expounded in the other
sense, Aretas, and Andr. Caesariensis on the place,
and by Bedae de rat. temp. c. 6. and by the suffrage of
the Church, the best expositor of the word of God;
wherein this day hath constantly since the time of the
Apostles been honoured with that name above other
daies</hi>] And I know no one man (nor many) that
at 1600 years distance almost, is so worthy to be
believed for the bare sense of a word, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
use and universal testimony of all ages from
that time till now.</p>
                  <p>As Christ is the Lord of all our Suppers, yet
all are not named The <hi>Lords</hi> Supper; so is it in
this case.</p>
                  <p>I must needs conclude therefore, that if I
should cast off the evidence of this Text, upon
no greater reason than you offer me, I think, I
should resist the holy Ghost, and use violence
against Gods word which I should obey.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:59348:91"/>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> There is no Law in the Scripture to observe
the first day, no promise made to observers of it, no
threatning against the breakers of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> shew it.
And if no Law, no transgression, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 15. Sin is
a transgression of the Law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> I have shewed you full proof of a Law
for it before. Though it is not Christs way to
enact his Laws in that Majestick Commanding
forms as God did to <hi>Moses</hi> on the Mount: But as
he condescended into flesh, to be a Teacher and
Saviour, in the form of a Servant, under the
Law himself, to redeem those that were under it,
so he maketh his Laws in a merciful Teaching
stile. All that is revealed by him as his will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
our duty is his Law. But that we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Lords day is revealed by him as his will,
making it our duty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>These are his Laws requiring us to Hear and
obey his spirit in his Apostles, Joh.</hi> 20. 21, 22.
As the Father hath sent me, so send I you: And
when he had said this, be breathed on them and said,
Receive ye the Holy Ghost; <hi>&amp;c. Luk.</hi> 10. 16. He
that heareth you, heareth me.</p>
                  <p>And this is his Law requiring his Apostles by
that spirit to promulgate his Laws, and make
known his will. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20. Go, disciple
me all Nations, Baptizing them, <hi>&amp;c. Teaching
them to observe all things whatever I have command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
you, and loe I am with you alwaies to the end of
the world</hi> (or age) with the other Texts fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited.</p>
                  <p>And that the Spirit in the Apostles hath setled
the Lords day, as the separated day for holy as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies
and Worship, I have proved to you,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:59348:92"/>
both by the Texts which you now sought in
vain to make void, and by the unquestionable
practice and history of the universal Church,
from that age untill this. And withal by other
Texts which you omit: which (not alone, but)
all set together make up the proof, because it is
historical evidence of a matter of fact, which we
have to seek after.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Christs Resurrection laid the foundation,
or gave the Cause; as Gods ceasing from his
works did of the Sabbath. 2. Christs appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to them assembled on that day, began the
actual separation. 3. The Holy Ghost coming down
on them, on that day, did more notably sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
it. 4. The Holy Ghost as an infallible spirit
in them, did cause them to make a publick settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that day in all the Churches, which was
the full and actual establishment. 5. This settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is fully proved <hi>de facto</hi> in Scripture and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
history. 6. And that there are promises
and threatnings, to the obeyers and rejecters, of
Christs commands, (whom the Father com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
us to hear, and who is the great Prophet
of the Church,) I hope you believe. Rev. 20. 14.
<hi>Happy are they who do his commandments that they
may have right to the tree of life,</hi> &amp;c. Heb. 12. 25.
<hi>See that yee refuse not him that speaketh; For if
they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth,
much more,</hi> &amp;c. Act. 3. 23. <hi>It shall come to pass
that every soul that will not hear that Prophet,
shall be destroyed from among the people:</hi> 1 Joh.
4. 6. <hi>We are of God: He that knoweth God hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us: he that is not of God, heareth not us:
Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of
Errour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="165" facs="tcp:59348:92"/>
If besides all this you must have <hi>particular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
promises and threatnings</hi> in the form which
you imagine to be fittest, you may for want of
those deny many other Gospel Laws as well as
this. Have you not much more for the separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Lords day, than you have for <hi>Infants
Baptism,</hi> for a <hi>Christian Magistrate,</hi> for <hi>Christians
wageing Warr,</hi> for <hi>prohibited degrees as to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I am perswaded the sober study of these points
would do much to convince the contrary minded,
1. How much of Christs work as to the settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Church-Orders, was committed to the
<hi>Apostles</hi> to be done, and how little he publickly
setled himself in person, before his Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. How much the Gospel administration ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celleth
that of the Law. And what eminent
Glory God designeth to himself by the work of
mans Redemption, and how much more now he
calleth man to Read, and Study and Know him in
the face of Jesus Christ, than in the Creation, And
how largely the change of the <hi>Covenant</hi> is proved
in the Epistle to the Hebrews.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. What a change is made herein as to mans
duty, since the fall of man under the <hi>wrath</hi> of the
<hi>Creator,</hi> who is not now his <hi>Rest,</hi> but his <hi>terrour</hi>
and a <hi>consuming fire,</hi> till Reconciled and Adopting
us in Christ; And since the <hi>Earth is cursed</hi> to us
as a punishment for our sins.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. How much of the certainty, and Glory of
the Christian faith, and of all our Rest and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation
in it, is laid in the Gospel on the
RESURRECTION of our Lord, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:59348:93"/>
a new World, or Creation as it were,
and as conquering and triumphing over death
and Satan, and sealing the promise and bringing
Life and Immortality to Light, and opening the
Kingdom of Heaven to Believers.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. How much of Christs Legislation, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of his Church-settlement and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
was to be done by the <hi>Holy Ghost!</hi> And
how glorious this office of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> is, and
of what grand importance to be understood:
As he was the promised Paraclete or <hi>Advocate</hi> or
<hi>Agent</hi> of our glorified Lord, to do his Work on
Earth in his bodily absence; To whom the Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility
of the Scriptures, the sealing operation
of Miracles, the Sanctification of Believers, and
forming them for Glory in the Image of God, is
to be ascribed: Whom to <hi>Blaspheme</hi> is the <hi>unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable
sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. How dangerous a thing it is made by the
Holy Ghost to seek to <hi>set up</hi> Moses <hi>Law,</hi> (as the
whole Epistle to the <hi>Gal.</hi> besides most of the other
Epistles testifie) as intimating a denyal of Christ,
and a falling from Grace, and a perverse setting
up of that which Christ came to take down,
as part of our own redemption. And how
large and plain <hi>Paul</hi> is upon this Subject; and
how the <hi>spirit</hi> in all the Apostles did determine
it, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. And how the <hi>Cerinthians, Nicolaitans,
Ebionites, Nazaraeans,</hi> and many more of the
condemned Heresies of that age, which troubled
the Churches, and whom the Apostles wrote
against, went all that way of mingling the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
Law with the Gospel.</p>
                  <p n="7">
                     <pb n="167" facs="tcp:59348:93"/>
7. How plainly and expresly <hi>Paul</hi> numbreth
<hi>Sabbaths</hi> with the shaddows that cease, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 16.
(to pass by other Texts) And what violence
mens own wits must use, in denying the evidence
of so plain a Text. Their reason, that he saith
not <hi>Sabbath</hi> but <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> is against themselves;
the plural number being most comprehensive, and
other Sabbaths receiving their name from this;
And the word <hi>Sabbath</hi> alwaies used in Scripture,
for a Rest which was partly Ceremonial. See
what Dr. <hi>Young</hi> in his excellent <hi>Dies Domin</hi> saith
of this Text (Though I know some say other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to the injury of their own cause,]</p>
                  <p n="8">8. How many years together the Churches
had been in possession, and consequently in the
undoubted knowledge, of the true established
day of holy Worship, before a word of the New
Testament was Written. And therefore that it
was not written to be the first enacting of this
day or change; but for other uses.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. And yet how much evidence of the fact
there is in the Scripture it self, that really such
a day was used for the ordinary Church-assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
as a peculiar separated day; even by the
Common <hi>order</hi> of the Apostles in the Churches,
as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 1, 2. speaks.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. And how impossible it is that all the
Churches in the World should from their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
keep this as the separated day, even by the
Apostles and from their times, if it had not been
so ordered by them indeed. And whether it be
possible that in no age neer the original hereof,
no Pastor, no Christian, no Heretick, no Enemy
would have detected the fraud or common
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:59348:94"/>
Errour, or once have written, that this day was
not separated or used by the Apostles or Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Churches; no nor any one (that I know of,
that denyed not the Resurrection) ever to have
scrupled or opposed the day.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Whether they that can reject such Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
evidence as this is, do not unwittingly cast
away the <hi>holy Scriptures,</hi> what zeal soever they
pretend or have for their honour and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Whether they that can reject all this evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and yet can find in the second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

Catechismes, &amp; all modal inventions of men,
as Images, if not Idols, are <hi>without partiality,</hi> or
do not walk as men, by very different measures;
and partial conceptions.</p>
                  <p>I would on my knees intreat some most dear

these twelve particulars.</p>
                  <p>But because by their preterition of the Text,
<hi>Act.</hi> 2. 1, 2. I perceive they observe not, that the

mentioneth a Council held in <hi>Scotland</hi> for the initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation

Edition fol. 200 and 201; And how the King of
<hi>England</hi> and the Nobility would not then receive
this alteration.—I conceive that in the first
Centuries the great Controversie relating to this
was about translating the keeping the Passover,
which they now call <hi>Easter,</hi> from the fourteenth day
of the first Moon, &amp;c. (under the colour of honouring
Christ) to the first day of the Week as the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

great vehemency to introduce—And as the
Pope obtained his purpose for one day in a year, so
by degrees in some places, came in one day in a

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:59348:95"/>
his raign, who made Laws for the Lords day,
which other Christian Emperours enlarged.
But how much earlier were all those Synods
which <hi>Eusebius</hi> mentioned, which in the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of <hi>Easter</hi> owned the Lords day? And
that of <hi>Nice</hi> was but about <hi>an.</hi> 327. The Council

                  <p>After this how many Councils and how many
Imperial Laws take care of the Lords dayes? It
is tedious to cite them.</p>
                  <p>To these may be added, 1. The common
agreement that it is founded in the <hi>Resurrection,</hi>
and was <hi>from that time.</hi> 2. The early contest
for keeping <hi>Easter</hi> only on that day, which you
note, as being a day by all Christians received.
3. The common detestation of <hi>Fasting</hi> on that
day. 4. And the universal custome of <hi>not
kneeling</hi> in adoration on that day: which all
shew that the day was specially observed.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Your Historical observations are utterly
mistaken. The observation of the Lords day was in
all the Churches past all Controversie from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
while the time of <hi>Easter</hi> was in Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie,
as I have proved. Why would you not name
those Churches in <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West</hi> (which I never
read or heard of) yea or that <hi>person,</hi> that was for
the seventh day alone? I am confident because
you could not do it. Indeed all Churches called
the seventh day alone by the old name <hi>Sabbath,</hi>
while they maintained the Sabbath to be ceased;
But under the name of the <hi>Lords day,</hi> the first
was solemnly observed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In <hi>Hoveden</hi> and <hi>Mat. Paris,</hi> there is not a
word of what you say; so much do you mis-cite
History. There is indeed <hi>an.</hi> 1201. (which as
I remember is <hi>Hovedens</hi> last) the story that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Authors talk of, and <hi>Heylin</hi> mentioneth, of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:59348:97"/>
one that sound a Letter pretended from Heaven
upon the Altar, reproving the crying sins of the
times, and especially the prophanation of the
Lords day, and requiring them to keep it strictly
for the time to come: which was so far from
being the <hi>initiation</hi> of the <hi>Lords</hi> day, that it was
about 1167 years after it. And how could men
pretend such a Divine reproof for such a sin, if
the day not been received before? I pray read
<hi>Heylins</hi> History against us, which will set you
righter in the matter of fact. And there is no
mention of any such Council as you talk of, for
the initiation of the Lords day, nor any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of the Kings, or Scots: There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of all this in <hi>Hoveden</hi> or <hi>Mat. Paris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. But what if <hi>England</hi> had been ignorant of
the Lords day till then (which is utterly untrue)
it followeth not that they kept the Sabbath on
the seventh day. Nor would a Barbarous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
corner of the World, prejudice the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of all Christs Churches in every age.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But that you may see how greatly you
mistake the case of <hi>England;</hi> read but our eldest
English Historian, <hi>Beda Hist. Eccles.</hi> As <hi>l.</hi> 1. 26.
he mentioneth an old Church named St. <hi>Martins</hi>
built in the Romans time, and <hi>cap.</hi> 33. a Church
built by the ancient faithful Romans; (And by
the way, I think it most probable that the Roman
Souldiers first brought Christianity into <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>)
so he oft describeth the Worship as agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to other Churches: And <hi>l. 2. c.</hi> 2. he begins
his reproof of the Britains for not keeping <hi>Easter</hi>
on the <hi>due Lords</hi> day, but never reproveth them
for not keeping the <hi>Lords day</hi> it self. And though
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:59348:97"/>
the Britans and the Scots had so little regard of
the English <hi>Bishops</hi> sent from <hi>Rome,</hi> that they
awhile refused so much as to eat with them, yea
or to eate in the same Inne (<hi>cap. 4. li.</hi> 2.) yet
about the Lords day there was no Controversie.
<hi>Lib. 3. c.</hi> 4. he tells you that the Scots difference
about <hi>Easter</hi> day continued till, <hi>an.</hi> 716. for want
of intelligence from other Churches, though
<hi>Columbanus</hi> and his followers were very holy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
And (that you may see you errour) he
there tells you that they did not keep <hi>Easter day
with the Jews on the fourteenth day still, as some
thought, but on the Lords day; but not in the right
week: For</hi> (saith he) <hi>they knew (as being Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians)
that the Lords Resurrection which was on
the</hi> first day of the week, <hi>was alwaies to be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
on the</hi> first day of the week; <hi>But being
Barbarous and Rusticks, they had not yet learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
when that same first day of the week, which is
now called the Lords day, did come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here you see that it was past Controversie
with them that the Lords day must be Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in memorial of Christs Resurrection, and the
Scots kept not <hi>Easter</hi> on any other Week day;
And that they had not been like Christians, if
they had not owned and kept the Lords day;
only they had not skill enough in Calculating the
times, so as to know when the true Anniversary
Lords day came about, but kept <hi>Easter</hi> on a
wrong Lords day.</p>
                  <p>The same he saith again in the praise of <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nan
lib. 3. cap.</hi> 17. that though he kept not <hi>Easter</hi> at
the due time, <hi>yet he did not, as some fals<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y think,
keep it on any week day in the fourteenth Moon
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:59348:98"/>
with the Jews; but he alwayes kept it on the Lords
day, from the fourteenth Moon to the twentieth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the Belief of the Lords Resurrection, which
the Church truly believed was on the first day of the
week for the hope of our Resurrection, and which
(they believed) will fall out on the same first day,
of the week, which is now called the Lords day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So <hi>cap.</hi> 25. the King and the Queen kept
<hi>Easter</hi> on several Lords dayes, and the difference
made the stir: And <hi>Wilfrid</hi> in his Speech there
saith the same, that the Scots kept <hi>Ester</hi> only on
the Lords day; (by whom the King at that
time was changed.)</p>
                  <p>And <hi>li. 3. c. 26. Beda</hi> saith that <hi>Tuda,</hi> (ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Bishop,</p>
                  <p>On the Lords daies the people flockt by crowds
together either to the Church, or to the Monasteries,
not to refresh their bodies, but to learn the word of
God; and if any Priest hapt to come into a Village,

                        <p n="6">6. Here beginneth
our fundamental diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence:
I shall first tell
you what we take for
the truth, and then
consider of what you
alledge against it.</p>
                        <div type="premises_of_answer">
                           <p n="1">1. We hold that
every Law is the Law
of some one; some
Law-maker or Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
power: And
therefore Christ being
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:59348:101"/>
now the Head over all things to the Church,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 22, 23. whatever Law is now in Being
to the Church, must needs be the Law of Christ.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. We hold that Christs Redeemed Kingdom
hath been Governed by him, with variety of
Administrations, by various Editions of his Law
or Covenant: That is, I. Universally to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
<hi>viz.</hi> 1. Before his Incarnation: which
was; first, To <hi>Adam,</hi> and secondly to <hi>Noah,</hi> and
to mankind in them both: 2. After his Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
II. Particularly, to the seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
even the Jews as a particular Political
society; chosen out of the World (not as the
only people or Church of God on Earth, but)
for peculiar extraordinary mercies as a peculiar
people.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. We believe that each of these Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
was fittest for its proper time and subject,
according to the manifold Wisdom of God: But
yet the Alterations were many and great, and all
tended towards perfection: so that the last Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Covenant by Christ Incarnate and his
<hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> much excelled all that went before,
in the Kingdom of the Mediatour. And all
these changes were made by God-Redeemer
himself.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. As it was the work of the Redeemer to be
the Repairer of Nature, and recoverer of man
to God; so in all the several Administrations, the
great Laws of Nature containing mans duty to
God, resulting from and manifested in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
as related to God, and in the <hi>Natura rerum</hi>
or the Works of God, was still made the chief
part of the Redeemers Law: so that this Law
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:59348:102"/>
of <hi>Nature,</hi> whose summe is the <hi>Love of God,</hi> and
of his <hi>Image,</hi> is ever the Primitive unchangeable
Law; and the rest are secondary subservient
Laws, either <hi>Positive,</hi> or <hi>remedying,</hi> or both. And
no tittle of this shall ever cease, if nature cease
not.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. But yet there are temporary Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which are about Temporary things; or
where the Nature of the thing it self is mutable,
from whence the Natural duty doth result. As
it was a duty by the then Law of Nature it self;
for <hi>Adams</hi> Sons and Daughters to Marry [In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
and multiply] being made a natural Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction,
and the means a natural Duty. And
yet now, it is incest against the Law of Nature,
for Brother and Sister to Marry. So it was a
Natural duty for <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> before their Fall
to love each other as innocent; but not so when
they ceased to be innocent: For <hi>cessanie materiâ
cessat obligatio.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>6. So also some Positive Commands made to
<hi>Adam</hi> in Innocence ceased on the fall, and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence;
(As to dress that Garden.) And some
positives of the first Administrations of Grace,
did cease by the supervening of a more perfect
administration. As the two Symbolical or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental
Trees in the Garden, were no longer
such to man when he was turned out; so no
positive Ordinance of Grace, was any longer in
force, when God himself repealed it, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction
of a more perfect Administration.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. Accordingly we hold, that a change is now
made of the sanctified day. Where note, 1. That
we take not the <hi>seventh day,</hi> (no nor one day in
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:59348:102"/>
seven, though that be nothing to our Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie)
to be a Duty by the proper Law of Nature,
but by a Positive Law: 2. That the seventh day
is never called a <hi>Sahbath</hi> till <hi>Moses</hi> time, but
only a <hi>Sanctified and blessed day;</hi> the word <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi>
being ever taken in Scripture for a day of
<hi>Ceremonial Rest,</hi> as well as of spiritual Rest and
Worship. 3. That Christ himself hath conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
a seventh day, but changed the seventh day
to the first; not as a Sabbath, that is, A day of
<hi>Ceremonial Rest,</hi> for he hath ended all Sabbaths as
shadows of things that were to come, even of
rest which remained for the people of God, <hi>Heb.</hi>
4. 9. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 16. And this is it which is incumbent
upon us to prove, and I think I have fully proved
already. 4. That having proved the thing done
(the positive Law of the seventh day changed by
the Holy Ghost to the first day) it concerneth us
not much to give the reasons of Gods doings:
But yet this reason may secondarily be observed:
That God having made the whole frame of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<hi>very good,</hi> did thereby make it the glass in
which he was to be seen by man, and the Book
which he would have man chiefly study, for the
knowledge of his Maker and his Will. But sin
having introduced, disorder, confusion and a
curse upon part of the Creation for mans sake,
God purposed at once, both to notifie to man,
what he had done by sin, in bringing disorder
and a curse upon the Creature, and blotting the
Book of Nature which he should have chiefly
used, and also that it was his good pleasure to set
up a clearer Glass, even <hi>Christ Incarnate,</hi> in
which man might see his Makers face, in a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:59348:103"/>
suitable to our need; not now as <hi>smile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon</hi> an <hi>Innocent</hi> man, nor as <hi>frowning</hi> on a
<hi>guilty man,</hi> but as <hi>reconciled</hi> to <hi>Redeemed</hi> man;
and to Write a Book in which his will should be
more plainly read, than in the blotted Book of
Nature: Yea in which he that in the Creature
appeared most eminently in <hi>Power,</hi> might now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
most eminently in LOVE, even redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
reconciling, adopting, justifying and saving
Love. So that, though God did not change the
day, till the Person of the Incarnate Mediator,
with his perfect last edition of the Covenant, was
exhibited, and set up as this clearer Glass and
Book, yet then as the seasonable time of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
(<hi>Heb.</hi> 9, 10, 11.) he did it. To teach
man that though still he must honour God as the
Creator, and know him in the Glass and Book
of the <hi>Creature,</hi> yet that must be now but his
secondary study; for he must primarily study
God <hi>in Christ;</hi> where he is revealed in <hi>Love,</hi>
even most conspicuous, wonderous Love.</p>
                           <p>And how suitable this is to man after sin and
cur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>e and wrath, may thus evidently appear.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. We were so <hi>Dead</hi> in sin, and utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of the spiritual <hi>Life,</hi> that the Book of the
Creatures, was not a sufficient means of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving:
But as we must have the QUICK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NING
SPIRIT of Jesus the Mediator, so
we must have a <hi>suitable means</hi> for that Spirit to
work by: which that the cursed mortified Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is not, appeareth in the experience of the
case of Heathens</p>
                           <p n="2">2. We were so <hi>Dark</hi> in sin, that the <hi>Creature</hi>
was not a sufficient means of our <hi>Illumination:</hi>
                              <pb n="187" facs="tcp:59348:103"/>
But as we must have the ILLUMINATING
SPIRIT of Jesus, so we must have a
Glass and Book that was suited to that illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating
work.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. We were so <hi>alienated</hi> from God, by <hi>Enmity</hi>
and <hi>malignity,</hi> and loss of LOVE, that as it
must be the <hi>spirit</hi> of Jesus which must regenerate
us unto LOVE, so it must be a clearer demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of LOVE than the Creature maketh
in its cursed state, which must be the fit means
for the spirit to work by in the restitution of our
LOVE.</p>
                           <p>Where further note, 1. That LOVE is <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness</hi>
and <hi>Happiness</hi> it self: and the operations
of Divine <hi>Love</hi> are his <hi>Perfective operations,</hi> and
so fit for the last perfective act. 2. That man
had many wayes fallen from LOVE: As he
had actually and habitually turned away his
own heart from God; and as he had fallen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Gods wrath, and so lost those fullest emanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Gods Love, which should cherish <hi>his
own Love</hi> to God; and as he had forfeited the
assistance of the <hi>spirit</hi> which should repair it;
and as he was fallen in Love with the accursed
Creature, and lastly as he was under the Curse or
threatning himself, and the penalties begun; It
being impossible to Humane Nature, to Love a
God who we think will damn us, and feel doth
punish us in order thereunto. So that nothing
could be more suitable to Lapsed man, or more

                           <p>II. Now I come to consider of what you say
against all this. You Cite the numbers of many
Chapters and Verses (contrary to your <hi>grand
principles,</hi> these <hi>divisions</hi> being <hi>Humane Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi>)
in all which there is nothing about the
Controversie in hand. The Texts speak not of
the <hi>Decalogue only,</hi> but of <hi>the Law,</hi> and of
<hi>Gods Commandments,</hi> and <hi>Christs Commandments.</hi>
Now I must tell you before-hand, that I will take
no mans word for the Word of God, nor believe
any thing that you say, <hi>God speaketh;</hi> without
proof. Prove it, or it goeth for nothing with
me. For as I know that adding to Gods Word
is Cursed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 18. as well as taking away;
so it I must once come to believe that God saith
this or that without proof, I shall never know whom
to believe: For twenty men may tell me twenty
several tales, and say that God saith them all.</p>
                           <p>I expect your proof then of one of these two
assertions (for which it is that you hold, no
man can gather by your own words, or citations.)
1. That all the Law which was in being at
Christs Incarnation, was confirmed and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

else that by the <hi>Law</hi> in all those <hi>Texts</hi> is meant
<hi>all the Decalogue,</hi> and the <hi>Decalogue alone.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Texts cited by you prove no more than
what we hold as confidently as you: <hi>viz,</hi> 1. That
all the Law of Nature, (where the <hi>Matter</hi> or <hi>Nature</hi>
of the things continue) is continued by Christ, and
is his principal Law. 2. That the Decalogue as
to that matter of it, is continued as it is the Law
of Nature (which is almost all that is in it,)
but not as the Jewish Law given by <hi>Moses</hi> hands
to the Political body. 3. That the Natural
part of all the rest of <hi>Moses</hi> Law is continued as
well as the Decalogue. 4. That all <hi>Moses</hi> Law as
well as the Decalogue shall be fullfilled, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth shall sooner pass away than one
jot or tittle of it shall pass till it be fulfilled.
5. That the Elements, Shadows, Predictions,
Preparations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are all fulfilled by the coming
of Christ, and by a more perfect Administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For Christ fulfilled all Righteousness, <hi>Mat.</hi>

<hi>perfecting</hi> it. And that by the Law in <hi>Matth.
5. 17, &amp;c.</hi> Christ meaneth, <hi>the whole body of Gods

which he saith, that he came not <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>,
to dissolve, pull in pieces or destroy the Law, as
a licentious Teacher, that would take off Gods
obligations, and leave the Wills and Lusts of
men to a Lawless liberty (which was it that the
Pharises imputed to such as were against the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:59348:105"/>
Law:) But that he came to bring in a <hi>greater
strictness,</hi> a <hi>righteousness</hi> not only <hi>exceeding</hi> that
of his accusers, <hi>v.</hi> 20. but instead of destroying
it, to perfect the Law it self, that is, to bring in a
perfecter Administration and Edition of the
Law. So that as Generation turneth <hi>semen in
suppositum,</hi> and so doth do away the <hi>seed,</hi> not by
destroying it, but by changing it into a perfecter
being; and as <hi>Paul</hi> saith, 1 Cor. 13. 16, 17, 18.
<hi>When that which is perfect is come, then that which
is in part shall be done away; When I was a child,
I spake as a child, I understood</hi> (or was affected)
<hi>as a child, I thought</hi> (or reasoned) as a child;
<hi>but when I became a man I put away childish
things,</hi> &amp;c. not that the <hi>child</hi> or his <hi>knowledge</hi> is
<hi>destroyed,</hi> but <hi>perfected,</hi> and <hi>changed</hi> into better;
And yet many Acts of his childish reasonings may
cease; And as he that would repair the Temple
to a greater glory, may take away the brass, and
put Gold instead of it, and so not change one
pin of the Temple by a <hi>destructive change</hi> but by
a <hi>perfecting change,</hi> which (to the frame) is to
<hi>edifie,</hi> and not to <hi>destroy;</hi> Even so Christ profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
that he came not to gratifie the lusts of men,
nor to destroy the Law in the smallest point, but
1. Himself to fulfill it in the very letter, and
2. To accomplish the shadows, Predictions and
Types, by coming himself as the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>End,</hi>
which when they had attained they were fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;
And 3. By a more perfect Edition and
spiritual Administration, advancing the Law to
a higher degree of excellency; by which not <hi>the
Law</hi> is said to be <hi>put away,</hi> or <hi>destroyed,</hi> but the
<hi>imperfections</hi> or weaknesses of it to be done
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:59348:105"/>
away. Not but that <hi>all Gods Laws</hi> are <hi>perfect</hi>
is to the <hi>time</hi> and <hi>subject</hi> which they are fitted
to; but not in comparison of the <hi>future time,</hi>
and <hi>degrees</hi> to be added. It is a <hi>Better Testament</hi>
that Christ bringeth in; Heb. 7. 22 &amp; 8. 6.
<hi>established on better promises,</hi> and <hi>procured</hi> by <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Sacrifice,</hi> and <hi>bringing a better hope,</hi> Heb. 8. 6.
<hi>&amp;</hi> 7. 19. and <hi>better things that are provided for us,
that they without us should not be made perfect,</hi>
Heb. 11. 40. So that when <hi>Moses</hi> Law is consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
as such, in that Imperfect state, it is essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
or <hi>formally</hi> all done away; but not <hi>materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,</hi>
for it is done away but by changing it into
a better Testament and more perfect administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which retaineth all that is <hi>natural</hi> in it,
and addeth <hi>better positives</hi> suited to riper
times.</p>
                           <p>So that the <hi>Law</hi> as denominated from the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler
Natural part, and as signifying the whole
Law or systeme of precepts, then in force, is not
destroyed, but perfected; But the <hi>Law</hi> as signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
that called <hi>Jewish</hi> delivered by <hi>Moses</hi> to
that Republick, as such, though part of the said
systeme, yet is the Imperfect part, and is taken
down and is now no Law, though it be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,
but <hi>fulfilled,</hi> and turned into a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Testament and Administration.</p>
                           <p>Now that by the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Commandments</hi> I
am not to understand the <hi>Decalogue only,</hi> in any
of your cited Texts, I thus prove.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. From the <hi>notation of the name.</hi> The
word [<hi>Law</hi>] in its usual proper sense, doth sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
the whole, or other parts as well as that;
and not that one part only. Therefore I must
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:59348:106"/>
so take it, till you prove that in any Text it hath
a limited sense. Else I shall turn Gods universal
or indefinite terms into particular, and pervert
his word, by limiting by my own invention where
God hath not limited.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Because the common sense in which the
Jewes, (against whom Christ spake) did take the
word [Law] Was not for the Decalogue only
but for the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> or all <hi>Moses</hi> Law. And if
Christ speak to them, he is to be supposed to speak
intelligibly, and therefore in their sense.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Because Christ in this very Chapter, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.
extendeth the sense further than the Decalogue:
As <hi>v.</hi> 17. he adjoynes the Prophets equally with
the Law, which he came not to destroy. And
thus he speaketh as the Jews, who distributed the
Old Testament into the <hi>Law and Prophets,</hi> when
by the Law they meant the <hi>Pentateuch.</hi> Now it
is certain that all the Prophesies that say
[<hi>The Messiah is not yet come, but shall come, and
be incarnate,</hi> and that shew the time and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,]
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not now true <hi>de futuro,</hi> as they
then spake; And yet they are not <hi>destroyed</hi> but
<hi>fulfilled,</hi> and so cease as prophecies of things yet
future. And so it is with the Positives of <hi>Moses</hi>
Law. 2. <hi>V.</hi> 18. he saith universaly, <hi>Till all he
fulfilled,</hi> and not the Decalogue only. 3. <hi>V.</hi> 19. he
extendeth it to the Least command. 4. <hi>V.</hi> 20. he
extendeth it to all the Pharises Righteousness,
which was Righteousness indeed. 5. <hi>V.</hi> 21. [<hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
shall kill, shall be in danger of the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>]
hath the political penalty in it, above the
bare sixth Commandment. 6. <hi>V. 31. Whosoever shall
put away his Wife, let him give her a writing
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:59348:106"/>
of divorcement,</hi> is not the bare seventh Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but fetcht from <hi>Deut.</hi> 24. 1. And this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
it self expoundeth, <hi>v.</hi> 17, 18. For when
Christ had protested against destroying an <hi>iota</hi> or
<hi>tittle</hi> of the Law, yet he changeth this very Law
now cited by himself, so far as it indulgeth
putting away; so that it is hence evident that
be meaneth not that he came not to make a <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
change,</hi> but that he came not to indulge
licentiousness, and Lust by a destructive change.
<hi>Luk. 16. 18. 1 Cor. 7. 10. Mat.</hi> 19. 9. So
7. <hi>V. 33. Thou shalt not forswear thy self,</hi> &amp;c. is
fetcht from, <hi>Lev. 19. 12, &amp;c. 8. V. 38. An eye
for an eye, &amp;c.</hi> is fetcht from <hi>Exod. 21. 24. Lev.</hi>
24. 20. <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. 21. and not from the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
alone. 9. So <hi>V.</hi> 43. is from <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 18.
and other places.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. Because in all <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles, and commonly
in all the New Testament the word <hi>Law</hi> is <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily,</hi>
if not alwayes, taken more extensively
than the <hi>Decalogue:</hi> Therefore to expound it for
the Decalogue only, is to contradict the constant
use of the Scripture, under pretense of expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Scripture.</p>
                           <p>If then by the <hi>Law,</hi> be meant either the whole
systeme of Gods Laws, Natural and Positive, or
all <hi>Moses</hi> Law, or the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> then I may
thus argue. <hi>It is most certain that much of this
Law of Moses is ceased or abrogate. Therefore it
is certain, that it was none of Christs meaning that
he would abrogate none of that Law which he
speaketh of, or change it for a better.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>That all and every word of the Decalogue is
not of the dureable Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> I shall prove
anon.</p>

victory over death and Satan, <hi>Rom. 1. 4. Phil. 3.
10, 11. 1 Pet. 1. 3. &amp; 3. 21. Rom.</hi> 4. 25.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The clean contrary therefore to your Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
is true: <hi>viz.</hi> That God did indeed end
the Work of his Creation on the sixth day, and
rested in it, as finished on the seventh: But
Christ was so far from ending his on the sixth,
and resting in it on the seventh, that on that
day above all other he seemed conquered by men
and by him that had the power of death, <hi>Heb.</hi>
2. 14 and was held as Captive by the Grave,
so that his Disciples hopes did seem dead with
him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 21. This State of Death being not
the least, if not the lowest part of his Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Whence came the Churches Article that
he descended into <hi>Hades.</hi> 3. I did more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
before prove from Christs own words com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with his burial, a casting down of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
day Sabbath, thus. That day on which
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:59348:108"/>
the Disciples are <hi>to fast,</hi> is not to be kept as a
Sabbath (For that is a day of Thanksgiving) But
on the day of Christs Burial, the Disciples were
to fast, (that is, to walk heavily:) Which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
from <hi>Mark.</hi> 2. 20. When the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom
is taken from them, then they shall fast.
Now though this meant not to command any
one day for fasting, much less the whole time of
his bodily absence, yet both the sense of the
words themselves, and the interpretation of the
Event tell us, that as there was no day in which
he was so sadly taken from them as that Sabbath
day, which almost broke their hearts and hopes,
(for the next day he was restored to them) So
there was no day in which they were so dejected,
and unlike to the Celebraters of a Gospel day of
Joy, or Sabbath. Do you call the day of Satans
power, and triumph, and of the Discples greatest
fear and grief that ever befell them, the Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Sabbath rest? It had indeed somewhat
like an <hi>outward</hi> Rest, but so as seemed plainly to
burie in his Grave the seventh day Ceremonial
Sabbath. And from the Reasons now pleaded
it was that the Western Churches kept the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
day as a Fast.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. Whilest the Lord

they did the rest of the
Jewish Law. For they
yet knew not that it was abrogated; But must
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:59348:109"/>
we do so too? You may as well argue from their
keeping the Sabbath before Christs Death, as on
that day when he was dead. The change of the
day was made by Degrees, by three several acts
or means. 1. The Resurrection of Christ, was
the <hi>founding</hi> act, which gave the Cause of chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it; Like Gods finishing his works of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at first. 2. The Inspiration of the Holy
Ghost in the Apostles doth teach them, and bring
all things to their remembrance which Christ
commanded, and was the authorising means of
the change: And the Apostles actual settlement
thereupon was the Promulgation. 3. The gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual
notification by the Preachers to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and finally the destruction of the Jewish
Policie, and Temple, and Priesthood, were the
fuller proclamation of it, and the way of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the change that was made by Command into
fuller Execution.</p>
                           <p n="10">10. The seventh day
Sabbath was observed by
the Apostles after the

in this time they sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
the Lords day,
as soon as (on that
day) the Holy Ghost
came down upon them.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. So all that while
they kept other parts
of the Jewish Law:
They scrupled, yea re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
a while Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with the Gentiles
as <hi>Act.</hi> 10. shews. They
so carryed it to the
Jews that <hi>Paul</hi> made it his defence, that he <hi>had
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:59348:109"/>
not offended any thing at all, either against the Law
of the Jews or against the Temple,</hi> Act. 25. 8. And
when he <hi>Circumcised Tim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>thy, purified himself,
shaved his head,</hi> for his Vow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Do you think
that all these are duties to Believers?</p>
                           <p n="3">3. None of the Texts cited by you do prove
that the Apostles kept the Sabbath at all <hi>as a
Sabbath,</hi> that is, a day on which it was <hi>their duty
to Rest;</hi> But only that they <hi>Preached</hi> on that day
in the <hi>Synagogues,</hi> and to the people; For when
should they Preach to them but when they were
Congregated, and capable of hearing? They
took it for no sin to Preach on the Sabbath no
more than I would do to Preach Christ on <hi>Friday,</hi>
which is their Sabbath, to the Turks, if they
would hear me. But Sabbatizing according to
the Law, was something else than Preaching.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. And it is most evident that for a long time
the Christian Jews did still keep the Law of
<hi>Moses:</hi> And that all that the Apostles did against
it then, was, but 1. To declare that Christ was
the end of the Law, and so to declare the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it to be <hi>unnecessary</hi> to Salvation, but not
<hi>unlawful,</hi> laying by the opinion of necessity.
2. That the Gentile Christians should not be
brought to use it, because it was unnecessary.
For the Apostles <hi>Act.</hi> 15. do not <hi>forbid</hi> it to the
<hi>Jews,</hi> but only to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> (who were never
under it.) Therefore the Apostles who lived
among the Jews no doubt did so far comply
with them to win them, as to keep the Law ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally,
though not as a <hi>necessary thing,</hi> that is,
not as a <hi>Law in force</hi> obliging them, but as a
thing yet lawful to further the Gospel. And
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:59348:110"/>
therefore no wonder if <hi>Peter</hi> went so far as to
withdraw from the Gentiles when the Jews
were present, when even <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle of
the Gentiles who speaketh so much more than all
the rest against the Law, doth yet as aforesaid
Circumcise <hi>Timothy,</hi> shave his head, purifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and as he became all things to all men,
so to the Jews he became a Jew. But when the
Jews Policie and Temple ceased, the change was
executively yet further made, and the Jewish
Christians themselves were weaned from their
Law. In the mean time <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>John, Rev. 2.
&amp;</hi> 3. do openly rebuke the Judaizing Hereticks,
the <hi>Ebionites</hi> and <hi>Cerinthians,</hi> and <hi>Nicolaitans,</hi>
and shew the perniciousness of their conceits.</p>

seeds are utterly corrupted now, <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 15. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
reason will tell men, that seeing all men in
all Nations, do measure their Time by Weeks, and
their Weeks by seven dayes, they should (besides
what of their time they offer up as due to God eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day) give one whole day of every Week to their
Maker, who hath allowed them so liberal a portion
of time, wherein to provide for themselves and their
families. There being no other proportion of time
that can so well provide for the necessities of families,
as six dayes of every Week, and that is so well fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to all Functions, Callings and Employments.
And the light of Nature (when cleared up) will
tell men, that all labour and motion being in order
to rest, and rest being the perfection and end of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
into which labour work and motion doth pass,
that therefore the seventh day which is the last day
in every Week is the fittest and properest day for a
religious rest unto the Creator, for his Worship,
<hi>Gen. 2. 1, &amp;c. Exod. 20. 9. Deut. 5. 13, 14.

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> How far a day is of Natural due, I
have shewed before: In all the words of
this reason (which I set down as I received
them) there is much which is no matter of
Controversie betwen us; As that there is a Light
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:59348:112"/>
and Law of Nature (which few men doubt of,
who are worthy to be called men) And that by
this Law of Nature God should be solemnly
worshipped, and that at a set or separated time.
I hope the Reader will not expect that I weary
him with examining the Texts which prove this
before it is denyed. But the thing denyed by us
is, that <hi>the seventh day Sabbath as the seventh, is of
Natural Obligation.</hi> The proofs which are
brought for this I must examine: For indeed
this is the very hindge of all our Controversie:
For if this be once proved, we shall easily confess
that it is not abrogate: For Christ came not to
abrogate any of the Law of Nature (though as
I have said, such particles of it may cease, whose
Matter ceaseth, by a change in Nature it self.)</p>
                  <p>The first proof is <hi>Exod. 20. 10. The stranger.</hi>
To which I answer, Our question is not whether
the Sabbath was to be rested on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

part of the Law of Nature? If it be intended
that [<hi>whatever such strangers were bound to, was

<hi>Major,</hi> which they offer not to prove: And I do
more than deny it: I disprove it by the Instances
of <hi>Ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by the Law of Nature? V. 48. 49. <hi>One

was not of the Law of Nature. <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 29. Rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

12. Jos. 8. 33, 34, 35. &amp; 20. 9, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next pretended proof is, <hi>Rom. 2. 14, &amp;c.</hi>
where there is not one syllable mentioning the
Decalogue as such, but only in general, <hi>The Law,</hi>
so far as it was written in the Gentiles hearts.
But where is it proved, that the <hi>Law</hi> or the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue</hi>
are words of the same signification, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent;
any more, than the <hi>whole</hi> and a <hi>part</hi> are?
Or where is it proved, that none of the rest of
the Law is written in Nature, but the Decalogue
only? Or else that every word in the Decalogue
it self is part of the Law of Nature, (which is the
question.) I shall prove the contrary anon: In
the mean time, the bare numbring of Chapters
and Verses is no proof.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is next said, that [<hi>Adam was made and

them as is of the Law of Nature, and had mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

to him as well as it is to us. But that's nothing
to the question, Whether all things in the ten

                  <p n="4">4. It is said, <hi>that the Law of the seventh day
Sabbath was given before the ten words were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed

Covenant of Works, or Innocency, which yet is
at an end. But what <hi>respect</hi> is it (to his <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane

this Proposition, [<hi>Whatever Law is given with
respect to humane nature, and to all men, is of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
and perpetual Obligation</hi>] I deny it. The
Law of S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>crinces and Oblations was given with
respect to <hi>humane nature,</hi> that is, in order to its
reparation, and it was given to mankind, and
yet not of natural perpetual obligation. The
Law of distinguishing clean Beasts from unclean,
and the Law against eating blood, were given to
<hi>Noah</hi> and to all mankind, with respect to <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature.</hi> Gen. 8. 20. &amp; 9. 4. and yet not
wholly of natural or perpetual obligation. All
common Laws have some respect to humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
But if your meaning be, that this Law

or that it is <hi>founded in,</hi> and <hi>provable by</hi> the

either in the nature of man, or the nature of

proof. <hi>Positives may have respect to humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
as <hi>obliged</hi> by them; and yet not be written
in humane nature, nor provable by any meer na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
evidence.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is said [<hi>Set times of Divine appointment
for solemn assembling,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>are directed to by the
great Lights,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Psal. 19. Rom.</hi> 10, &amp;c.] <hi>Ans.</hi> But
the question is not of <hi>set times</hi> in general (that
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:59348:114"/>
some there be) But of this set time, the <hi>seventh
day</hi> in particular. It will be long before you can
f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tch any cogent evidence from the Lights of
Heaven for it. Nor do any of the Texts cited
mention any such thing, or any thing that can
tempt a man into such an opinion. It must be
the <hi>Divine appointment</hi> and <hi>institution</hi> (which
you mention,) that must prove our obligation to
a particular day, and not any <hi>nature</hi> within us or
without us.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>The only appearance of a proof is at the end,
that</hi> time being measured by Weeks, and the end of
the Weeks being fittest for Rest, therefore nature
points us to the last day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> But 1. You do not at all <hi>prove,</hi> that <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
teacheth all men to measure their time by Weeks.</hi>
2. Nor is your Philosophy true, that <hi>all motion is
in order to rest.</hi> Indeed all Labour is, that is, all
the Motion of any Creature which is out of its
proper place, and moveth towards it. But if
you will call the <hi>Action</hi> of <hi>Active natures,</hi> such
as our <hi>souls</hi> are, by the name of <hi>spiritual motion,</hi>
or <hi>Metaphysical motion,</hi> as many do, then no
doubt but cessation is as contrary to their nature,
as corporal motion is to the nature of a stone:
And the <hi>Rest,</hi> that is, the <hi>perfection, pleasure</hi> and
<hi>felicity of Spirits,</hi> consisteth in their greatest acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
in good; <hi>They rest not saying, Holy, Holy, &amp;c.</hi>
3. You transfer the case from a day of <hi>Worship</hi> to
a day of <hi>Rest.</hi> And so make your cause worse:
Because nature saith much for one stated day of
<hi>Worship;</hi> but not for one stated day of <hi>Rest</hi> from
<hi>labour,</hi> further than the <hi>Worship it self</hi> must have
a vacancy from other things. For reason can
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:59348:115"/>
prove no necessity to humane nature of Resting a
whole day, any more than for a due proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning
of <hi>Rest</hi> unto <hi>Labour</hi> every day. The Rest
of one hour in seven, is as much as the Rest of
one Day in seven. Or if some more additional
conveniences may be found for <hi>Dayes</hi> than <hi>Hours,</hi>
there being no convenience without its inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
this will but shew us, that the Law is well
made when it is made, but not prove a <hi>priore</hi>
that <hi>there is</hi> or <hi>must be</hi> such an universal Law.
As you can never prove, that Nature teacheth
men the distribution of Time by Weeks (1. It
being a thing of Tradition, Custom and Consent.
2. And no man naturally knoweth it, till others
tell him of it. 3. And many Nations do not
so measure their time. 4. And no man can bring a
Natural Reason to prove that it must be so, which
they might do if it were a Law of Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son)
so also that every Family, or Countrey at
least, should not have leave to vary their dayes
of Rest, according to diversity of Riches and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,
Health and Sickness, Youth and Age,
Peace and War, and other such cases, you cannot
prove necessary by Nature alone, though you
may prove it well done when it is done. 4 You
cannot prove the <hi>last day</hi> more necessary for Rest,
than the first, or any other. For there are few
Countreys, where Wars, or some other necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
have not constrained them sometimes to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate
the Sabbaths Rest: which when they have
done, it is as many dayes from the third day to
the third, as from the seventh to the seventh.
5. If Time were naturally measured by Weeks,
yet it followeth not, that Rest must be so: some
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:59348:115"/>
Countreys are strong and can labour longer, and
others tender and weak, and can labour less.
6. And seeing that the Reason of a day for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
Assemblies, is greater and more noble,
than the Reason of a day for Bodily Rest, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
will rather tell us, that God should have
the <hi>first day,</hi> than the <hi>last; A Jove principium:</hi>
As God was to have the <hi>first born,</hi> the <hi>first
fruits, &amp;c.</hi> 7. If we might frame Laws for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Worship by such conceits of convenience, as
this is of the last day in seven as fittest for Rest,
and call them all the Laws of Nature, what a
multitude of additions would be made, and of
how great diversity? whilst every mans conceit
went for Reason, and Reason for Nature, and
so we should have as many Laws of Nature, as
there are diversities of conceits. And yet that
there is such a thing as a Law of Nature in which
all Reason should agree, we doubt not. But
having in vain expected your proof, that the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
day Sabbath is the Law of Nature, or of
universal natural obligation, I shall briefly prove
the Negative (that it is not)</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That which is of natural obligation may be
proved by Natural Reason (that is, by Reason ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing
from the nature of the thing) to be a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
But that the seventh day must be kept holy
as a Sabbath, cannot be proved from the nature
of the thing. Therefore it is not of Natural
obligation. He that will deny the Minor, let
him instance in his natural proof.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That is not an universal Law of Nature,
which Learned, Godly men, and the greatest
number of these, yea, almost all the world, know
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:59348:116"/>
no such thing by, and confess they cannot prove
by Nature. But such is the seventh day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath—<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
It is not I alone that know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of any such Law, nor am able by any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Evidence to prove it, but also all the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
and other Christians that I am or ever was
acquainted with: Nay, I never knew one man
that could say, that he either had such a Law in
his own nature (unless some one did take his
conceit for a Law) nor that he could shew such
3 Law <hi>in natura rerum.</hi> And it is a strange Law
of Nature, which is to be found in no ones Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but perhaps twenty mens or very few in a
whole age; nor is discerned by all the rest of the
world. If you say, that few understand nature
or improve their reason: I answer 1. If it be such
a Law of Nature as is obliterated in almost all
mankind, it is a very great argument that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
being changed, the Law is changed. How
can that oblige which cannot be known? 2. Are
not we <hi>men</hi> as well as you? Have not several
Ages had as great improvers of nature as you?
If <hi>grace</hi> must be the improver, are there, or have
there been none as <hi>gracious?</hi> If <hi>Learning</hi> must
be the improver, have there been none as learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
If <hi>diligence</hi> or <hi>impartiality</hi> must be the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provers
of nature, have there not been many as
diligent, studious and impartial as your selves?
Let all rational men judge which of these is the
better argument, [<hi>I and twenty men more in
the world do discern in Nature an universal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
on mankind to keep the seventh day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath:
Therefore it is the Law of Nature.</hi>] Or
[The world of mankind, godly and ungodly,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:59348:116"/>
learned and unlearned, discern no such natural
obligation, except you and the few of your
mind: Therefore it is no Law of Nature.]</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That is not like to be an Universal Law of
Nature, which no one man since the Creation
can be proved to have known and received as such
by meer natural reasons without tradition. But
no one man since the Creation can be proved to
have known and received the seventh day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
by meer natural reason without tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Therefore it is not like to be an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Law of Nature. If you know any man,
name him and prove it; For I never read or
heard of such a man.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If the Text mention it only as a Positive
Institution, then it is not to be accounted a Law
of nature. But the Text mentioneth it only as
a Positive institution—As is plain, Gen. 2. 3.
<hi>God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that in it he had rested from all his work, &amp;c.</hi>
If it had been a Law of nature, it had been
made in Nature, and the making of Nature
would have been the making of the Law. But
here are two arguments against that in the
Text.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Blessing</hi> and <hi>sanctifying</hi> are positive acts of
supernatural institution, superadded to the works
of nature: They are not Divine <hi>Creating</hi> acts,
but Divine <hi>instituting</hi> acts.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That which is blessed and sanctified, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
God rested in it from all his works,</hi> is not
blessed and sanctified meerly by <hi>those works</hi> or
that <hi>Rest:</hi> And if neither the <hi>works</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi>
nor the <hi>Rest</hi> of God from those <hi>works</hi> did sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:59348:117"/>
it, then it is not of natural sanctification, and
so not of natural obligation.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If the very <hi>Reason</hi> of the day be not of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
but of supernatural <hi>Revelation,</hi> then the
sanctification of the day is not of natural, but
supernatural revelation and obligation. But the
former is certain. For no man breathing ever
did or can prove by Nature, without superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Revelation, that God made and finished
his works in six dayes, and rested the seventh.
<hi>Aristotle</hi> had been like to have escaped his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the worlds eternity, if he could have
found out this by nature.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The distinction of <hi>Weeks</hi> is not known by
nature, to be any necessary measure of our time;
Therefore much less, that the seventh day of the
Week must be a Sabbath. The Antecedent is
sufficiently proved, in that no man can give a
cogent reason for the necessity of such a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
And because it hath been unknown to a
great part of the world. The <hi>Peruvians, Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi>
and many such others knew not the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Weeks. And <hi>Heylin</hi> noteth out of <hi>Jos.
Scaliger de Emend. Temp. li. 3. &amp;</hi> 4. and <hi>Rossinus
Antiq.</hi> and <hi>Dion,</hi> that neither the <hi>Chaldees,</hi> the
<hi>Persians, Greeks,</hi> nor <hi>Romans</hi> did of old observe
Weeks; and that the <hi>Romans</hi> measured their
times by <hi>eights,</hi> as the Jews did by sevens. <hi>Hist.
Sab. P. 1. Ch. 4. p.</hi> 83, 84. And <hi>p.</hi> 78. he citeth
Dr. <hi>Bounds</hi> own words, <hi>p. 65. Ed.</hi> 2. confessing
the like, citing <hi>Beroaldus</hi> for it as to the <hi>Roman</hi>
custom. Yea, he asserteth that till near the time
of <hi>Dionys. Exig. an.</hi> 500. they divided not their
time into Weeks as now. In which he must
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:59348:117"/>
needs except the Christians and consequently the
ruling powers since <hi>Constantine.</hi> And if they
were so unsetled through the world in their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
by Moneths, as Bishop <hi>Vsher</hi> at large ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
in his <hi>Dissert. de Macedonum &amp; Asianorum
Anno solari,</hi> (see especially his <hi>Ephemeris</hi> in the
end, where all the dayes of each Moneth are
named without Weeks) the other will be no won-wonder.</p>
                  <p>I conclude therefore 1. That one day in seven,
rather than in six or eight, may be <hi>Reason</hi> be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
to be convenient when God hath so Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
it: But cannot by Nature be known to be
of natural universal obligation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That this one day should be the <hi>seventh,</hi> no
Light of Nature doth discover: Therefore
Dr. <hi>Bound,</hi> Dr. <hi>Ames,</hi> and the generality of the
Defenders of one day in seven against the Anti-sabbatarians,
do unanimously assert it to be of
Positive supernatural institution, and not any
part of the Law of Nature: Though <hi>stated dayes</hi>
at a convenient distance is of the Law of Nature.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Whether every word in the Decalogue be of the Law
of Nature? and of perpetual obligation? And
whether all that was of the Law of Nature was
in the Decalogue?</head>
                  <p>BUt the great argument to prove it the Law of
Nature is, because it was part of the ten
words written in stone. To which I say, that
the Decalogue is an excellent summary of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
of the Law of Nature, as to the ends to
which it was given; but that,</p>
                  <p>I. It hath more in it than the Law of Nature.</p>
                  <p>II. It hath <hi>less</hi> in it than the Law of Nature:
And therefore was never intended for a <hi>meer</hi> or
<hi>perfect transcript</hi> of the Law of Nature: but for
a perfect general summary of so much of that
Law as God thought meet to give the Jews by
supernatural revelation, containing the chief
heads of Natures Law (lest they should not be
clear enough in Nature it self) with the additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of something more.</p>
                  <p>I. That the Decalogue written in stone hath
<hi>more</hi> than the Law of Nature, is proved 1. By
these instances; 1. That <hi>God brought them out of
the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and out the house of servants,</hi>
and that he is to be worshipped in that relation,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:59348:118"/>
is none of the Law of Nature, universally so
called.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That God is merciful (and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled)
to thousand Generations of them that
Love him, notwithstanding mans natural state of
sin and misery, and all mens actual sin, this is of
supernatural Grace, and not the Law of meer
Nature.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The great difference between the wayes of
Justice and mercy, expressed by the third and
fourth Generation, compared to Thousands, is
more than the meer Law of Nature.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Those Divines who take all Gods positive
Institutions of Worship, to be contained in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative
part of the second Commandment,
must needs think that it containeth more than
the Law of nature (Though I say not as they;
but only that as a <hi>General Law,</hi> it obligeth us to
perform them, when another Law hath institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them.)</p>
                  <p n="5">5. To rest one day in seven is more than the
Law of Nature.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. To rest the seventh day rather than the
sixth or first is more than the Law of Nature.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The strictness of the Rest, to do no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Work, is more than a Law of Nature.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. That there be Man servants, and Maid
servants, besides <hi>natural</hi> inferiours, is not of the
primitive or universal Law of Nature.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The distinction of the Israelites from
strangers within their Gates, was not by the Law
of Nature.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. That <hi>Cattle</hi> should do no manner of work
(as for a Dog to turn the spit in a wheel, or
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:59348:119"/>
such like) is more than a Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. That God made Heaven, and Earth in six
dayes and rested the seventh, is not of Natural
Revelation.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. That this was the reason wherefore God
blessed the Sabbath day aud hallowed it, is not of
Natural Revelation.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Some will say that more Relations than
Natural being meant in the fifth Commandment,
maketh it more than a Law of Nature.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. That the <hi>Land</hi> of <hi>Canaan</hi> is made their
reward, is a positive respecting the Israelites
only.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. That <hi>length of dayes</hi> in that Land should
be given by Promise, is an act of Grace, and not
of Nature only.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. That this promise of length of dayes in
that Land, is made more to the Honouring of
Superiours, than to the other commanded duties,
is more than Natural.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I prove it also by the Abrogation of the
Law written <hi>in stone,</hi> which I proved before; If
the Decalogue had been the <hi>Only</hi> and <hi>Perfect</hi> Law
of Nature, it would not have been so far done
away, as the Apostle saith it is (of which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.)</p>
                  <p>II. <hi>All the Law of Nature was not in the Tables
of Stone.</hi> Here I premise these suppositions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That a <hi>General Law</hi> alone, obligeth not to
all particulars, without a Particular Law. <hi>E. g.</hi> If
the second Command say, <hi>Thou shalt perform all
Gods instituted Worship:</hi> Or, <hi>Thou shalt Worship
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:59348:119"/>
me, as I appoint thee?</hi> This bindeth no man to
Baptism, the Lords Supper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> till another Law
appoint them. Therefore there is not so much in
the general Law alone, as is in that and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
also.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. All that is presupposed in a particular Law,
is not part of that Law.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is not so much to inferr a duty indirectly
and by far fetcht Consequences, as to command
it directly.</p>
                  <p>Now I prove the assertion by instances. All
these following are Natural duties, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
also in other parts of Scripture, and yet
are not in the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> as Written in Stone.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To believe that the soul is Immortal. 2. To
believe that there is a Heaven where we shall be
perfectly blessed in the Knowledge, Love and
Fruition of God. 3. To believe that there is a
Hell, or life of future punishment for all the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent.
4. To Love ourselves, with a just and
necessary Love, as such. 5. To take greatest
care to save our souls, above our bodies. 6. To
tame and mortifie all our fleshly lusts in order to
our own Salvation. 7. To deny all bodily plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
profit, honour, liberty and life, for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
of our salvation. 8. To forbear all
outward acts of Gluttony, Drunkenness, Sloth,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> as they tend to our own damnation. 9. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
in persecution because of our great reward
in Heaven. 10. To pray constantly, and servently
for Heaven, as the means of our obtaining it.</p>
                  <p>Let none say that <hi>many</hi> of these same things
are commanded in order to <hi>God,</hi> and our <hi>neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</hi>
For I grant that the same material acts be
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:59348:120"/>
so; as they are expressions of Love to <hi>God</hi> and
<hi>Man:</hi> But to do them in <hi>Love</hi> to our <hi>selves</hi> and
for our own Salvation, is another principle and
end, not contrary to, but necessarily conjunct with
the former two: And indeed all the duties of
<hi>self-love</hi> as such are past by (as supposed) in
<hi>Moses</hi> Decalogue; because they are deeply writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in mans Nature, and because the Law was
Written as Political, for another use.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But these are all supposed in the first Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of Loving God, and in the second Table,
Thou shalt Love thy Neighbour as thy self.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. These last are not the words of the
Decalogue: but a part of the summary of all the
Law. 2. Both Tables indeed <hi>suppose</hi> the <hi>Love</hi> of
our selves, but that which is <hi>supposed,</hi> is not a
<hi>part</hi> of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But it is the Socinians that say the Old
Testament speaketh of no reward or punishment but
in this life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> True: But <hi>Camero (de tripl. faed.</hi>) and
others that rightly understand the matter affirm,
that, 1. The <hi>Law of Nature</hi> containeth future
rewards and punishments in another life, 2. And
so doth the Covenant of Grace made with
<hi>Adam</hi> and all mankind in him, and renewed
to <hi>Noah, Abraham</hi> and the Israelites, which by
<hi>Paul</hi> is called The <hi>Promise</hi> as distinct from the
<hi>Law.</hi> 3. But the <hi>Law of</hi> Moses <hi>in its own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Nature as such,</hi> was only Political, and spake
but of Temporal Rewards and Punishments.
4. Though yet all the faithful were bound to take
the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Promise</hi> together, and so to have
respect both to Temporal and Eternal things.
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:59348:120"/>
For the Law it self <hi>connoted</hi> and <hi>supposed</hi> things
Eternal as our great concernment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>III.</hi> There is more of the Law of Nature in
other parts of <hi>Moses</hi> Law, conjunct with the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,
than is in the Decalogue alone.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. V.</head>
                  <head type="sub">Whether the truest Antiquity be for the seventh
day Sabbath as kept by the Churches of Christ?</head>
                  <p>IT is here further objected that the seventh day
Sabbath hath the truest testimonies of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity:
that it is controvertible when and how the
Lords day came in; but the Antiquity of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
day Sabbath is past Controversie: that the
Eastern Christians long observed it, and Antichrist
in the West did turn it into a Fast: that
the Empire of <hi>Abassia</hi> keepeth it to this
day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> There is enough said of this before,
were it not that some Objectors causlesly look
for more. I answer therefore, 1. That it is
true that the Sabbath is more ancient than the
Lords day; And so is <hi>Moses</hi> more ancient than
Christ Incarnate, and his Law than the Gospel
as delivered by Christ and his Apostles, and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision
than Baptism, and the Passover than
the Lords Supper; And so every mans Conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
Nativity, Infancie and Ignorance was
before his Maturity and Knowledge. And
what can you gather from all this? Thus the
Papists say that their way of Religion was in
<hi>England</hi> before ours, and that the reliques of it
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:59348:121"/>
in our Monuments [<hi>Orate pro animabus,</hi> &amp;c.]
is their standing witness, which we cannot
totally deface: And its true, if by our <hi>way</hi>
they mean the Reformation of theirs as such:
For the <hi>Cure</hi> is ever after the disease: Though
its false if they speak of our Religion it self;
which was here before their errours, as Health is
before sickness. But they should consider, that
by this prerogative the Heathens excell us both:
And that they may say, you have yet many Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents
of our more ancient Religion, which
you have not been able to obliterate: You still
call your Week dayes by our ancient names,
<hi>Sunday, Munday,</hi> &amp;c. Your adoration towards
the <hi>East</hi> was fetcht from us, and so were abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of your Customes: Which we hope may
recover the reputation of our Religion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I have shewed you already how and why
the Eastern Christians kept the Sabbath:
1. They kept it not as a Sabbath, but only met
on that day as they did on the fourth and the
sixth dayes, (<hi>Wednesdayes</hi> and <hi>Fridayes</hi>) as it
is used in <hi>England</hi> to this day. And for the
most part they Celebrated not the <hi>Lords</hi> Supper on
that day. And they abhorred the keeping it as
a day of Rest.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They met on that day for all these Reasons.
1. Because having been used in the beginning to
meet every day in the Week (when they had all
things common, and were to shew the power of
the Evangelical Doctrine to the height, <hi>Act. 2.
44, 45, 46. &amp;</hi> 4. 33, 34, 35.) as they found
cause to retrive their community, so did they
to meet seldomer, and yet not so seldome as
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:59348:122"/>
once a Week: And therefore as we now keep
other meetings for Lectures and Prayers, besides
the Lords day, so did they then on <hi>Wednesdayes,
Fridayes,</hi> and <hi>Saturdayes.</hi> 2. Because the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of the Jews was a great part of their
work and hope: And therefore to win them,
they would with <hi>Paul</hi> become Jews, that is,
not affect an unnecessary distance, but come as
neer them as Lawfully they could. 3. Because
Converted Jews were no small part of the Eastern
Churches: who could not easily be quite
brought off from Jewish Customes; And the
rest were unwilling to offend them, being taught
not to despise the weak that observed meats and
days, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. &amp; 15. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 4. Because the
Assemblies on the seventh day were taken as fit
preparatories to the sanctifying of the Lords day,
on which account the Church of <hi>England</hi> now
appointeth them. These things one that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with Church History needeth no
proof of.</p>
                  <p>And they are sufficiently proved before. <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi>
words before cited are full. And those
of the Council of <hi>Laodicea, Can.</hi> 29. are more
full, who do at once appoint meetings on the
seventh day, and yet Anathematize them that
Judaize thereon, by bodily rest; and would have
men labour on it, and preferr the Lords day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> in his Dialogue with <hi>Trypho,</hi>
doth largely shew that Circumcision and the
Sabbath are ceased by the coming of Christ, and
his Institutions, and are not now to be used by
Christians. And what writer have we of full
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:59348:122"/>
reputation and credibility more ancient than
<hi>Justin,</hi> from whom any testimony in this case
might be sought?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tertullian</hi> (one of the next) <hi>li.</hi> 2. against
<hi>Marcion</hi> saith, that the Sabbath was for that
Time, and present occasion, or use, and not for
perpetuity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Athanasius</hi> was one that was for meeting on
the Sabbath: And yet writeth his Book <hi>de Sab.
&amp; Circum.</hi> purposely to prove that the Sabbath
is ceased with Circumcision as a Shadow, and
that now the Lords day is the sanctified day.
And the like he hath most expresly <hi>in Homil. de
Semente,</hi> as is cited before, saying that, <hi>The Master
being come, the Vsher was out of use; and the Sun
being risen the Lamps are darkened.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Basil Ep.</hi> 74. Writeth against <hi>Apollinaris</hi> for
holding that after the Resurrection, we should
keep Sabbaths, and Judaize<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; As if that were
the perfection to which Christ would restore
men.</p>

                     <pb n="224" facs="tcp:59348:123"/>
3. And as for the <hi>Abassians</hi> keeping the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
Its true, they keep that day in some
sort: But it is as true, that they use Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,
and many other Jewish Ceremonies;
besides oft Baptizings; And that they profess
not to use these as the Jews do, but only as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Customes, and as <hi>Paul</hi> did while he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
with them, using the outward action for
other ends than <hi>Judaizers</hi> do. And the rather
because they think their Emperours descended
from <hi>Solomon.</hi> But the Lords day they keep on
the same account as other Christians. And if
this instance make any thing for Sabbatizing, it
will make as much for Circumcising, and other
Jewish rites, but nothing against the Sanctifying
of the Lords day.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And as for the matter of <hi>Fasting</hi> on the
Sabbath, the Churches greatly varyed in their
Customes. The <hi>Eastern</hi> Churches, and <hi>Millan</hi> in
the <hi>West,</hi> were against Fasting on the Sabbath on
two accounts, 1. Because, as is said, they would
not offend the Jewes. Even as many peaceable
Non-Conformists, who are against many Holy
dayes now established, do yet forbear labouring
and opening their Shops on those dayes, because
they will not give offence; Yea and go to hear
the Sermons on those dayes, though they keep
them not Holy <hi>as such</hi> dayes. 2. Because there
were many sorts of Hereticks in those times,
who held that the World was made by an evil
God, and thence came evil, and so they Fasted
on the seventh day on that reason: Which made
the Christians avoid it lest they should Symbolize
with those Hereticks. And therefore the (real
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:59348:123"/>
or pretended) <hi>Ignatius</hi> speaketh so severely
against <hi>Fasting</hi> on the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> as well as on the
Lords day. And so do the Constitutions called
the Apostles; yea and the Canons called theirs,
<hi>Can.</hi> 65.</p>
                  <p>But in the <hi>Western</hi> Churches, (as is aforesaid)
both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Hereticks</hi> were more distant, or
less considerable for numbers; and therefore they
fasted on the seventh day, and that the rather lest
they should seem by Sabbatizing to Judaize.
Which was before Antichrists appearing, unless
you think all the holy Doctors before cited,
and all the Western Churches to be Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian.</p>
                  <p>Having gone thus far I here add two more
Scripture Arguments to prove the abolition of
the Jewish Sabbath. The first is because it is
frequently made (as Circumcision is) a sign of
the particular Covenant between God, and that
Nation as they were a political body, and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
people. Therefore if their Policy cease,
and Gods relation to them as a Political body,
and peculiar people, and so that Political Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with them, then also the <hi>signe</hi> of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
and Relation ceaseth. And though the
word [<hi>for ever</hi>] is sometime added, it is no
other than is oft added also to the Jewish Law
and Ceremonies.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From <hi>Act.</hi> 15. Where the case is determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by a Council of Apostles, Elders and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
yea by the Holy Ghost. <hi>V.</hi> 28. It appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
by <hi>V.</hi> 24. that the thing asserted by the false
Teachers was, [that the Gentiles <hi>must be Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
and keep the Law;</hi> that is, <hi>of Moses] V.</hi> 1.
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:59348:124"/>
Now the seventh day Sabbath was part of that
Law (As <hi>Sacrificing</hi> was, though it was a Law
before.) But the Holy Ghost determineth the
case, [<hi>to lay on them no greater burden than these
necessary things,</hi>] after named; where the <hi>Sabbath</hi>
is none of them, and therefore hereby shut out.
The precepts given to <hi>Noah</hi> are named (of which
the Sabbath was not one.)</p>
                  <p>Obj. <hi>By this Exposition you may say that the
rest of the Decalogue is excluded:</hi> For <hi>Idolatry,
Murder,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>are not here forbidden by name.
Answ.</hi> I have fully proved that the Decalogue as
written in Stone, and part of the Law or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of <hi>Moses</hi> is not at all in force, especially
to the Gentiles, nor yet as part of the
Covenant (or promise) of Works, made with
<hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency: For the form of the Promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sory
Covenant of Works ceased upon mans sin,
and the promise of a Saviour; And the <hi>form</hi> of
the Mosaical Law or Covenant never reached to
the Gentile Nations and is ceased to the Jews:
Therefore the <hi>Matter</hi> must cease as it constituted
the same Covenant, when the <hi>forme</hi> ceased: And
<hi>Paul</hi> saith expresly that this Law Written in
Stone is done away: But, 1. The <hi>Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
as a meer Law never ceased: 2. And Christ
hath taken it into his Covenant, as part of the
Matter of it: So that it is wholly in force,
though not as part of the Covenant of Works,
either <hi>Adamical</hi> or <hi>Mosaical.</hi> But the Sabbath
as to the seventh day, was no part of the Law
of Nature, as is proved: And <hi>Paul</hi> expresly
saith that it was a <hi>shadow of things to come,</hi>
and is therefore vanished away, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 16.
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:59348:124"/>
Had it been part of the Law of Nature, it had
bound us as such and as Christs Law: or had
it been one of the Enumerated particulars,
<hi>Act.</hi> 15. it had bound the Neighbour Gentiles,
<hi>pro tempore</hi> at least. But being neither, that
Council dischargeth Christians from the observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it, as far as I can understand the Text.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is long since the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Treatise was promised
to a Person of Honourable
Rank, who was enclined
to the Jewish Sabbath;
but before it was finished,
or well begun, I had a sight of a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
on the same subject, by the late
Reverend Worthy Servant of Christ
Mr. <hi>Hughes</hi> of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> which enclined
me to take my promised work as unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.
But yet some reasons moved
me to reassume it. Near two Moneths
after it went from me to the Press, the
said Treatise of Mr. <hi>Hughes</hi> first, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
another on the same subject by
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:59348:126"/>
Dr. <hi>I. Owen</hi> came abroad. Yet do I not
reverse mine, because many Witnesses
in an Age of <hi>Enmity</hi> and <hi>Neglect,</hi> can be
no injury to a truth so serviceable to
the Cause of Christianity, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity
of the Church, and the good of
souls. Though if I were one that took
the Churches prosperity to consist in the
Riches, Grandeur, Ease and <hi>Domination</hi>
of Empire of Papal Pastors, rather than
in the humble, holy, heavenly, self-denying
imitation of a <hi>Crucified Christ,</hi>
I would have forborn a subject which
is all for our preparation for a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Sabbatism, and carrieth men above
the sensual Rest of Fleshly men, and
therefore is so much disrelished by
them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 6, 7, 8. But supposing it
my duty to do what I have done, I
think meet to advertise the Reader,
that when several men treat of the
same subject, though they speak the same
things in the main, yet usually each
of them bringeth some considerable
light, which is omitted by the rest:
And as the same Spirit sets them all on
work, so all together give suller evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to the truth, than any one of
them alone. And I hope the Concourse
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:59348:126"/>
of these three Tractates doth progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticate,
that (though the Devil hath
so contrived the business for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane,
that like Papists, they will hear
and read none, but those that are not
like to change them; yet) God will
awaken the sober and serious believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of this Age, to a more holy and
fruitful improvement of his day; which
will greatly tend to the encrease of
real Godliness, and consequently to the
recovery of the dying hopes of this
<hi>apostatizing</hi> and <hi>divided</hi> Age.</p>
                  <p>But that which moveth me to write
this <hi>Postscript,</hi> is to acquaint thee, for
the prevention of scandal by any seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
differences in our Writings, 1. That
it cannot be expected, that all who
plead the same Cause, should say just
the same things for it, for matter and
manner of argumentation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That if I own the Name <hi>Sabbath</hi>
less than some others, and adhere more
to the name of the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> I do not
thereby oppose the use of the name
of <hi>Sabbath</hi> absolutely; nor is that in it
self a Controversie about the <hi>Matter,</hi>
but the <hi>Name,</hi> which though not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible,
yet is of far less moment than
the <hi>Thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="232" facs="tcp:59348:127"/>
3. That if I make not use of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Old Testament Texts as some others,
I do not thereby deny the usefulness of
them, nor call you off from the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of any argumentation or evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
thence offered you.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That if I seem to be more for the
cessation of <hi>Moses</hi> Law than some others,
even of that part which was written
in Stone, yet no part of the Law of
Nature is thereby denyed by me any
more than by any of them; And they
that are angry with me, for writing
so much against the Antinomians, should
not also be angry with me for going no
further from them, than the force of
Truth constraineth me.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That you must pardon me for my
purposely avoiding the name of the
[<hi>Moral Law</hi>] Mr. <hi>Cawdry</hi> and Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi>
who have written most largely of the
Sabbath, have told you the reason. I
love not such <hi>names,</hi> as are not fitted
to the nature of <hi>things,</hi> but are fitted to
signifie almost what the Speaker pleaseth.</p>
                  <p>I know no Law which is not <hi>formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Moral,</hi> as being <hi>Regula actionum Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralium.</hi>
And men may if they will, as
well confine the signification of the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:59348:127"/>
word [<hi>Law</hi>] it self, as of a [<hi>Moral
Law</hi>] Nor doth <hi>use it self</hi> sufficiently
notifie the distinguishing signification
of it: For one meaneth by that name,
all the Law of <hi>Nature</hi> as such. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
meaneth only so much of the Law
of Nature as is common to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
Another meaneth all Positive
Laws of supernatural Revelation, which
are perpetual and universal, as well as
the Law of Nature. Therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
finding fault with others, it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth
me to distinguish Laws by such
names as plainly signifie the intended
difference. And though by the <hi>Law
of Nature,</hi> I mean not formally the same
thing that some others do, I have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
opened my sense and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of it, in my Reasons of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That they who say, that the Old
Covenant, or the Covenant of Works
made by <hi>Moses</hi> with the Jews is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate
or ceased, and the Decalogue
as a part of, or belonging to that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
do say the same thing that I
do, when I maintain that the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
and whole Law as Mosaical is
ceased, but that all the <hi>Natural part</hi> is
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:59348:128"/>
by Christ assumed into his Law or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Grace. For it is the same
thing which is denominated the <hi>Law</hi>
(of <hi>Moses,</hi> or of Christ) from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive
part, and and a Covenant from
the <hi>terms,</hi> or sanction, especially the
Promissory part. Nor is there any
part of the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> which was
not a part of the Mosaical <hi>Covenant.</hi>
And if the <hi>Form cease</hi> which denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nateth,
the <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>denomination</hi> cease<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and all the <hi>parts</hi> as <hi>parts</hi> of that
which ceaseth. So that if the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Works made with the Jews
cease (which <hi>Camero</hi> calleth a third
or middle Covenant, and several men
do variously denominate, but the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
calleth <hi>the old,</hi> or <hi>former Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
or <hi>Testament,</hi> or <hi>Disposition</hi>) then
all the Law as part of that Covenant
ceaseth: And that is as much as to say
also that it ceaseth as meerly Mosaical,
or Political to the Jews. And then
the Argument is vain, <hi>This or that word
was written in the Tables of Stone: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is of perpetual obligation.</hi> For as
it was written <hi>in</hi> Stone, it was Mosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical,
and is done away; and under the
New Covenant all that is Natural and
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:59348:128"/>
Continued, shall by the Spirit be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
upon the Heart; whence sin at first
did obliterate it.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. That as the Rest of God in the
Creation is described by a <hi>Cessation</hi>
from his work, with a complacency
in the goodness of it: but Christs Rest
is described more by Vital <hi>Activity</hi> and
<hi>Operation,</hi> than by <hi>Cessation</hi> from <hi>work,</hi>
even his Triumphant Resurrection as
the Conquest of Death, and beginning
of a New Life: so I think the Old
Sabbath is more described by such <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
Rest,</hi> or Cessation <hi>from</hi> work,
which was partly Ceremonial, or a sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
shadow, and that the word
Sabbath is never used in the Scripture,
but for such a day of Ceremonial Rest
(though including holy Worship).
But that the <hi>Lords day</hi> and its due ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
is more described by <hi>spiritual
Activity</hi> and <hi>Operation,</hi> in the spiritual
Resurrection of the soul, and its new
Life to God; And that the <hi>Bodily Rest</hi>
is no longer <hi>Ceremonial</hi> or <hi>shadowy,</hi> but
fitted to the promoting and subserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the <hi>spiritual Activity</hi> and <hi>Complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
in God and holy exercises of the
mind, as the <hi>body</hi> it self is to the service
of the soul.</p>

8. That I am not ignorant that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the <hi>English</hi> Divines long ago
expound <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 20. of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Sabbath, and <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 16. as exclusive of
the Jewish Weekly Sabbath: But so
do not most Expositors, for which I
think they give very good reasons,
which I will not stand here to repeat.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. That I intended not a full and
elaborate Treatise of the Lords Day,
but a brief Explication of that Method
of proof which I conceive most easie
and convincing, and fittest for the use
of doubting Christians; who are many
of them lost in doubts in the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
and obscurity of arguments from
the Old Testament: when I think that
the speedy and satisfactory dispatch of
the Controversie is best made by a
plain proof of the Institution of Christ
by the Holy Ghost in the Apostles;
which I thought to have shewed in
two or three Sheets, but that the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of producing some evidence of
the fact, and answering other mens
Objections, drew it out to greater
length. And my method required me
to say more of the practice of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
than some other mens. But
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59348:129"/>
again, I must give notice that Dr. <hi>T.
Ysoungs Dies Dominica</hi> is the Book which
I agree with in the Method and Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
way of determining this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie,
and which I take to be the
strongest written of it: And that I
omit most which he hath, as taking
mine but as an Appendix to his, and
desire him that will write against mine,
to answer both together, or else I shall
suppose his work to be undone.</p>
