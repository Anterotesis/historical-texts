         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen the Lord Jeſus came to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he beheld the City<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and wept over it, with this lamentation: <hi>Oh that thou hadſt
known in this thy day the things that belong to thy peace!</hi> The
ſame tenderneſſe is witneſſed now in them which the Lord
hath enlightned. I cannot but mourn over you, to ſee how
you lye wallowing in your filth, and joyne hand in hand,
and ſmite with the fiſt of wickedneſſe, and yet lean upon
Chriſt for ſalvation: Know you not that <hi>many ſhall ſay in
that day, Lord, Lord?</hi> but remember what will be your
anſwer; <hi>Go you curſed into the lake, I know you not.</hi> Oh that thou wouldſt but ſtand
ſtill a little, and turn thy eye inward; Sit downe a little, and conſider thy poore
ſoul that lyes in death: What will become of thee, thou murdereſt the juſt in thee,
there is a Talent to be improved in thee, how wilt thou give an accompt of it; the
Steward is now come: in the coole of the day, then <hi>Adam</hi> heard the voyce of
God, and then he ſaw his nakedneſs, and ſo may eſt thou; If thou wilt turn in thy
minde to the light of Chriſt in thee, the light will diſcover to thee thy fallen ſtate,
and how thou art turned out from the preſence of God, and art in the gall of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe,
and the earth is curſed for thy ſake: Now if thou wilt minde the light,
and waite in it, which is the grace of God that hath appeared to thee, there is the
firſt ſtep to pure redemption: And if thou take diligent heed to this light in thee,
thou ſhalt finde it checking thee continually for all thy evill deeds, and it will
teach thee to be ſober minded and upright in all thy dealings as in the ſight of
God: and ſo thou wilt come to ſee the ſtraight gate and narrow way that leads to
life; but thou wilt ſay, Chriſt hath done all this for me, I have nothing to do but
believe: but it will be ſaid unto thee, when thou thinkeſt to ſit downe with thy
Lord; <hi>Friend, how cameſt thou hither without a wedding-garment?</hi> then know what thy
portion will be. Faith is another thing then thou takeſt it to be; He that hath
Faith, if it be never ſo little, ſhall witneſſe Chriſts words to be true, <hi>he ſhall remove
mountains:</hi> Now in the ſtill ſilence, in the light that ſhines in darkneſſe in thee,
thou wilt come to reliſh that little grain of Faith which is held in a pure conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and ſo feele the mountains remove, which preſſeth downe thy ſoule: but ye
<hi>will not come unto me that ye may have life,</hi> ſaith Chriſt Jeſus; It is thy will that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
thee, for in thy will the Devill lodges. <hi>Adam</hi> when he diſobeyed the minde
and will of God, then he entred into his own will, and ſo was turned out into the
Devils Kingdome. Now Chriſt Jeſus the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> who is God manifeſt in fleſh,
condemning ſinne in the fleſh, if thou live in him in thee, and believe in him in thee,
then thou ſhalt witneſſe his power to the cutting down of thy will; for thy will
muſt come to death, that the will of God may be done, and ſo that Scripture comes
to be fulfilled in thee, which are the words of Chriſt; <hi>Loe I come, in the volume of thy
booke it is written of me to doe thy will O God,</hi> which is the book of conſcience in thee,
there the will of God is to be done: And as thou comeſt to love the light, and
live in it, thou wilt come to ſee the righteous law of God fulfilled in thee, Death
reigns in thee. Now Death reigned from <hi>Adam</hi> till <hi>Moſes,</hi> and when <hi>Moſes</hi> came,
then was the Law given forth; and ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets till <hi>John:</hi> But thou
wilt ſay, <hi>thou art not under the Law, but under Grace?</hi> let the light ſearch thee, and
it will aske thee, how cameſt thou to be under Grace? Is not the law for cleanſing;
When waſt thou cleanſed? or where doſt thou think to be cleanſed? Doth not
Chriſt Jeſus ſay, that he is come to fulfill the Law, and that one jot nor tittle ſhall
paſs unfulfilled, and wilt thou ſpeak of his words, and not believe him? Yea, thou
ſhalt know, that for that very end is there a meaſure of Chriſt given unto thee;
that if thou deny thy ſelfe, and yeeld obedienc<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to his will, thou ſhalt witneſſe the
whole Law fulfilled in thee, but it is through judgment, and through burning, for
through judgement is Zion redeemed: but <hi>hearken a little, and conſider, hear and thy
ſoule ſhall live.</hi> If thou be willing to take up the Croſſe of Chriſt, and deſpiſe the
ſhame, thou ſhalt witneſſe pure peace of conſcience: and though it may ſeem hard
to the world, yet there is living refreſhments: Yea, glorious is the worke of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
but none can ſee it but thoſe that come through it: And now the way
of eternall life is laid before thee, if thou ſlight it, it ſhall lye at thy doore: and
therefore take heed what thou doſt; for when the booke of conſcience is opened,
thou ſhalt witneſſe thou haſt been warned in thy life-time.</p>
