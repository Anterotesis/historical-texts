            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HOW long, O charming <hi>Iris!</hi> shall I speak in vain of your adorable Beauty? You have been just, and believe I love you with a Passion perfectly tender and extream; and yet you will not allow your Charms to be infinite. You must either accuse my Flames to be unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, and that my Eyes and Heart are false Judges of Wit and Beauty; or allow, that you are the most perfect of your Sex. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of that, you always accuse of me Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, when I speak of your infinite Merit; and when I refer you to your Glass, you tell me, that flatters, as well as <hi>Damon;</hi> though one
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55553:3"/>
wou'd imagine, that shou'd be a good Witness for the Truth of what I say, and undeceive you of the Opinion of my Injustice. Look—and confirm yourself, that nothing can equal your Perfections. All the World says it, and you must doubt it no longer. O <hi>Iris!</hi> Will you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute against the whole World?</p>
            <p>But since you have so long distrusted your own Glass, I have here presented you with one, which I know is very true; and having been made for you only, can serve only you. All o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Glasses present all Objects, but this reflects only <hi>Iris;</hi> whenever you consult it, it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you; and tell you, how much Right I have done you, when I told you, you were the fairest Person that ever Nature made. When other Beauties look into it, it will speak to all the fair Ones; but let 'em do what they will, 'twill say nothing to their Advantage.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>Iris,</hi> to spare what you call flattery,</l>
               <l>Consult your Glass each Hour of the Day:</l>
               <l>'Twill tell you where your Charms and Beauties lie,</l>
               <l>And where your little wanton Graces play:</l>
               <l>Where Love does revel in your Face and Eyes;</l>
               <l>What Look invites your Slaves, and what denies.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Where all the Loves adorn you with such Care,</l>
               <l>Where dress your Smiles, where arm your lovely Eyes;</l>
               <l>Where deck the flowing Tresses of your Hair:</l>
               <l>How cause your Snowy Breasts to fall and rise:</l>
               <l>How this severe Glance makes the Lover die;</l>
               <l>How that, more soft, gives Immortality.</l>

               <l>

Where you shall see, what 'tis enslaves the Soul;</l>
               <l>Where e'ry Feature, e'ry Look combines:</l>
               <l>When the adorning Air, o're all the whole,</l>
               <l>To so much Wit, and so nice Vertue joyns.</l>
               <l>Where the <hi>Belle Taille</hi> and Motion still afford</l>
               <l>Graces to be eternally ador'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>But I will be silent now, and let your Glass speak.</p>

                  <hi>DAmon,</hi> (O charming <hi>Iris!)</hi> has given me to you, that you may sometimes give your self the Trouble, and me the Honour of Consulting me in the great and weighty Affairs of Beauty.

                     <hi>The Shape of</hi> IRIS.</head>
                  <p>I Must begin with your Shape, and tell you, without Flattery, 'tis the finest in the World, and gives Love and Admiration to all that see you. Pray observe how free and easie it is, without Constraint, Stiffness, or Affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; those mistaken Graces of the Fantastick, and the Formal; who give themselves Pain to shew their Will to please; and whose Dressing makes the greatest part of its Fineness, when they are more oblig'd to the Taylor, than to Nature; who add, or diminish, as occasion serves, to form a Grace, where Heaven ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver gave it: And while they remain on this
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55553:4"/>
Wreck of Pride, they are eternally uneasie, without pleasing any Body. <hi>Iris,</hi> I have seen a Woman of your Acquaintance, who, having a greater Opinion of her own Person, than any Body else, has screw'd her Body into so sine a Form (as she calls it) that she dares no more stir a Hand, lift up an Arm, or turn her Head aside, than if, for the Sin of such a Disorder, she were to be turn'd into a Pillar of Salt; the less stiff and fix'd Statue of the two. Nay, she dares not speak or smile, lest she shou'd put her Face out of that order she had set it in her Glass, when she last look'd on herself: And is all over such a Lady Nice (excepting in her Conversation) that ever made a ridiculous Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure. And there are many Ladies more, but too much tainted with that nauseous Formality, that old-fashion'd Vice: But <hi>Iris,</hi> the charming, the all-perfect <hi>Iris,</hi> has nothing in her whole Form, that is not free, natural, and easie; and whose every Motion cannot please extreamly. and which has not given <hi>Damon</hi> a thousand Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals.</p>
                  <lg>

                     <l>Who sighs incessantly for you:</l>
                     <l>Whose whole Delight, now you are gone,</l>
                     <l>Is to retire to Shades alone,</l>
                     <l>And to the Eccho's make his Moan.</l>
                     <l>By purling Streams the wishing Youth is laid,</l>
                     <l>Still sighing <hi>Iris!</hi> lovely charming Maid!</l>
                     <l>See, in thy Absence, how thy Lover dies;</l>

                     <hi>The Discretion of</hi> IRIS.</head>
                  <p>BUT O <hi>Iris!</hi> The Beauties of the Body are imperfect, if the Beauties of the Soul do not advance themselves to an equal height. But, O <hi>Iris!</hi> What Mortal is there so damned to Malice, that does not, with Adoration, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, that you (O charming Maid!) have an equal Portion of all the Braveries and Vertues of the Mind? And, who is it, that confesses your Beauty, that does not, at the same time acknowledge and bow to your Wisdom? The whole World admires both in you; and all, with impatience, ask, Which of the two is most surprising, your Beauty, or your Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? But we dispute in vain on that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Subject; for after all, 'tis determin'd, that the two Charms are equal. 'Tis none of those idle Discretions that consists in Words alone, and ever takes the Shadow of Reason for the Substance; and that makes use of all the little Artifices of Subtilty, and florid Talking, to make the outside of the Argument appear fine, and leave the inside wholly mis-understood: Who runs away with Words, and never thinks of Sence. But you, O lovely Maid! never make use of these affected Arts; but without being too brisk, or too severe; too silent, or too talkative; you aspire in all your Hearers, a Joy, and a Respect. Your Soul is an Enemy to that usual Vice of your Sex, of using little Arguments against the Fair; or by a Word,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55553:11"/>
or Jest, make your self and Hearers pleasant, at the Expence of the Fame of others.</p>
                  <p>Your Heart is an Enemy to all Passions, but that of Love. And this is one of your noble Maxims: <hi>That every one ought to love, in some part of his Life: And that, in a Heart truly brave, Love is without Folly: That Wisdom is a Friend to Love, and Love to perfect Wisdom.</hi> Since these Maxims are your own, do not, O charming <hi>Iris!</hi> resist that noble Passion: And since <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> is the most tender of all your Lovers, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer his Passion with a noble Ardour: Your Prudence never fails in the Choice of your Friends; and in chusing so well your Lover, you will stand an eternal President to all unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable fair Ones.</p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>O thou that dost excel in Wit and Youth!</l>
                     <l>Be still a President for Love and Truth.</l>
                     <l>Let the dull World say what it will,</l>
                     <l>A noble Flame's unblameable.</l>

                     <l>They scorn the Censure of the Fools.</l>
                     <l>Yield, <hi>Iris,</hi> then; Oh, yield to Love!</l>
                     <l>Redeem your dying Slave from pain:</l>
                     <l>The World your Conduct must approve:</l>

                     <hi>The Goodness and Complaisance of</hi> Iris.</head>
                  <p>WHO but your Lovers (fair <hi>Iris!)</hi> doubts, but you are the most complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant Person in the World: And that with so much Sweetness you oblige all, that you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55553:11"/>
in yielding; and as you gain the Heart of both Sexes, with the Affability of your noble Temper; so all are proud and vain of obliging you. And <hi>Iris,</hi> you may live assur'd, that your Empire is eternally establish'd, by your Beauty, and your Goodness: Your Power is confirm'd, and you grow in Strength every Minute: Your Goodness gets you Friends, and your Beauty Lovers.</p>
                  <p>This Goodness is not one of those, whose Folly renders it easie to every Desirer; but a pure Effect of the Generosity of your Soul; such as Prudence alone manages, according to the Merit of the Person, to whom it is exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; and those whom you esteem, receive the sweet Marks of it; and only your Lovers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain: Yet even then you charm. And though sometimes you can be a little disturb'd, yet through your Anger, your Goodness shines; and you are but too much afraid, that that may bear a false Interpretation: For oftentimes Scandal makes that pass for an Effect of Love, which is purely that of Complaisance.</p>
                  <p>Never had any Body more Tenderness for their Friends, than <hi>Iris:</hi> Their Presence gives her Joy; their Absence, Trouble; and when she cannot see them, the finds no Pleasure, like speaking of them obligingly. Friendship reigns in your Heart, and Sincerity on your Tongue. Your Friendship is so strong, so constant, and so tender, that it charms, pleases, and satisfies all, that are not your A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorers. 'Tis therefore, <hi>Damon</hi> is excusable, if he be not contented with your noble Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55553:12"/>
alone; for he is the most tender of that Number.</p>

                  <p>YOU are deceiv'd in me, fair <hi>Iris,</hi> if you take me for one of those ordinary Glasses, that represent the Beauty only of the Body; I remark to you also the Beauties of the Soul: And all about you declares yours the finest that ever was formed; that you have a Wit that surprizes, and is always new: 'Tis none of those that loses its Lustre, when one considers

it; the more we examine yours, the more ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable we find it. You say nothing, that is not at once agreeable and solid; 'tis always quick and ready, without Impertinence, that little Vanity of the Fair; who, when they know they have Wit, rarely manage it so, as not to abound in Talking; and think, that all they say must please, because luckily, they some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times chance to do so. But <hi>Iris</hi> never speaks, but 'tis of use; and gives a Pleasure to all that hears her. She has the perfect Art of pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating, even the most secret Thoughts.

                     <hi>The Modesty of</hi> Iris.</head>
                  <p>I Perceive, fair <hi>Iris,</hi> you have a Mind to tell me, I have entertain'd you too long, with a Discourse on yourself. I know, your Modesty makes this Declaration an offence, and you suffer me, with Pain, to unveil those Treasures you wou'd hide. Your Modesty, that so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable a Vertue in the Fair, and so peculiar to you, is here a little too severe: Did I flatter you, you shou'd blush: Did I seek, by praising you, to shew an Art of Speaking finely, you might chide. But, O <hi>Iris!</hi> I say nothing, but such plain Truths, as all the World can witness are so. And so far I am from Flattery, that I seek no Ornament of Words. Why do you take such Care to conceal your Vertues? They have too much Lustre, not to be seen, in spight of all your Modesty: Your Wit, your Youth, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55553:13"/>
Reason oppose themselves, against this dull Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structer of our Happiness. Abate, O <hi>Iris,</hi> a little of this Vertue, since you have so many other, to defend yourself against the Attacks of your Adorers.</p>
                  <p>You yourself have the least Opinion of your own Charms: And being the only Person in the World, that is not in love with 'em, you hate to pass whole Hours before your <hi>Looking-Glass;</hi> and to pass your time, like most of the idle Fair, in dressing, and setting off those Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which need so little Art. You, more wise, disdain to give those Hours to the Fatigue of Dressing, which you know so well how to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy a thousand Ways. The Muses have blest you, above your Sex; and you know how to gain a Conquest with your Pen, more absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, than all the industrious Fair, who trust to Dress and Equipage.</p>
                  <p>I have a thousand things to tell you more, but willingly resign my place to <hi>Damon,</hi> that faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Lover; he will speak more ardently than I: For, let a Glass use all its Force, yet, when it speaks its best, it speaks but coldly.</p>
                  <p>If my Glass, O charming <hi>Iris!</hi> have the good Fortune (which I cou'd never entirely boast) to be believ'd, 'twill serve, at least, to convince you, I have not been so guilty of Flattery, as I have a thousand times been charg'd. Since then my Passion is equal to your Beauty (without Comparison, or End) believe, O lovely Maid! how I sigh in your Absence: And be perswaded to lessen my pain, and restore me to my Joys;
<pb facs="tcp:55553:14"/>
