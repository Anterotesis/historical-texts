            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I made choice (not without justifiable inducements) of your Congregation for their first breathing. But it was not mine intent that they should be buried with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the walles where they first breathed, but that they should from you travel over the whole land where they might get admittance and acceptance. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse an <hi>Ambition</hi> in me of pressing forth (some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times)
<pb facs="tcp:2298:3"/>
into the <hi>publique,</hi> but it is only in some pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique pressure, that when others are silent, I may be the <hi>Drummer,</hi> (I dare not say the <hi>silver Trumpet</hi>) to give the <hi>march unto the Lords Armies,</hi> against his, and his peoples enemies. Therefore I come not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad untill some incumbent or imminent calamity doth drive me; not as the sea-porpesses to prenun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate a storme, but rather with the <hi>Halcion</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a calme.

worke, then our beasts are by us when they worke not as wee would: Sometimes layd flat on their bellies, and receiving an hundred blowes or more on their backes: sometimes on their backes, and so belly-beaten that they seeme tympanous, and bladders rather then bellies: sometimes balled with tough cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels on the soles of their feet, untill their feet be swolne unto foot-bals, and so left to crall away, vsing as well as they can, their hands insteed of feet. how many upon slight suspition and false suggestion of a fault, have beene dragged through the streets on the hard stones by ropes or coards fastned into their bored feet? The very pictures of which torments, what eyes, save those which stand in Turkes heads can behold with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out teares? I will not aggravate those grievances which are already too great by inserting reports how they are aggravat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by some of our nation, who should rather with every true hearted Christian, endevour to ease them, not adding more affliction to such heavie bonds. Charity bids me to be incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of that, which griefe and passion causeth some of ours bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to divulge, that there are among us who for their private gaine doe not a little advance the prevailing of the common enemy against their country-men and brethren; that ours are surprised with our owne powder and shot, and afterwards la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in <hi>Barbarie</hi> with English gyves and yrons. God forbid that it should be so; but if it be so, may it not be probablie conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded (at least conjectured) that those incestuous arrowes which have dispersed the noisome Pestilence have come out of this quiver of not compassionating our woefull brethren, but rather augmenting their woes?</p>
            <p>God (I hope) will raise up some happie hand to exhibite to our gratious <hi>Soveraignes</hi> eyes &amp; eares <hi>Danmoniorum gemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> as our predecessors the old <hi>Brittons</hi> pressed by the <hi>Picts,</hi> presented unto the <hi>Consul Boëtius, Britannorum gemitus;</hi> (but with better successe.)</p>
            <p>Neither will that illustrious <hi>Peere,</hi> the Oracle of Iustice in our land, faile to performe what he is said to have promised at <hi>Plymouth</hi> with tearefull eyes (the evidences of a tender and
<pb facs="tcp:2298:6"/>
truly religious heart) to the mournfull wives and children of these oppressed captives, that when he returned to the Court, he would become their advocate unto the Majestie of the King. <hi>Remember him ô my God concerning this, who is so vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant in doing justice at home, that he is not dormant in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending mercy to those who suffer extreame misery abroad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any doe aleadge that our owne wants will not suffer us to succour them in theirs, I say so too: I acknowledge it that our wants who are at libertie doe restraine us from releiuing our brethren, who are in barbarous captivity. But what wants? <hi>Want of charity,</hi> want of the <hi>bowels of mercy,</hi> want of <hi>Christian compassion,</hi> want of feeling our brethrens wants, and consequently of true <hi>Christianity,</hi> these these are the wants that doe hinder us. How much hath beene lavishly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in <hi>Pompes,</hi> in <hi>Playes,</hi> in <hi>Sibariticall-feasts,</hi> in <hi>Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon sutes,</hi> and <hi>Proteus-fashions,</hi> besides other vanities, and yet there is no complaining of want? How many soules might have beene ransommed from that <hi>Hell</hi> on <hi>Earth, Barbarie,</hi> with halfe these expences? Yet heerein doe men only complaine of want. Of all others let us beware of this want of compassion toward our lamentable captived Brethren; of whose insuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table bondage if wee have no feeling, we our selves are in a farre worse thraldome, as one passage in these ensuing <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi> will shew us.</p>

Part of the people without the City<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were made captive by the enemy, part of them within made themselves captives unto vices.

            <p>And because next unto <hi>faith</hi> whereby we are united un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the head, love is most necessary whereby the members are knit together, therefore the holy Authour immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the doctrine of <hi>faith</hi> exhorteth unto <hi>brotherly love</hi>: <note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 13.1</note>

For who cannot grieve in such occurrents? Or who cannot esteeme his brethrens griefe to be his owne? seeing the

Apostle Paul doth say, <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 12.26.</note> 
               <hi>If one member doth suffer, the other members doe suffer with it, and if one member doe rejoyce, the other members doe rejoyce with it.</hi> And in an other place. <note n="b" place="margin">2. Cor. 11.29.</note>

               <hi>As many of you as are Baptized into Christ have put on Christ,</hi> in our captive-brethren we must contemplate <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe. And he is to be redeemed from the danger of captivity, who hath redeemed us from the danger of Death; that hee who drew us out of the jawes of the Devill, and remaineth and dwelleth in us, should now himselfe be deliuered out of the hands of <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and be ransomed with some part of our mony, who ransomed us with his <hi>Crosse</hi> and his <hi>Bloud:</hi> who in the meane time doth therefore permitt these things to come to passe for the triall of our faith, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther every one of us will doe for his brother, that which he would have to be done for himselfe, if he were now in bonds under the <hi>Barbarians.</hi> For what man who is mindfull of humanity and well advised of <hi>Christian Charity,</hi> if he be a Father, doth not thinke that his sons are there?

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE greatest incitement unto <hi>Mercy</hi> is, that wee have a fellow-suffering with others in their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, that we succour others in their necessities, as much as we are able, and sometimes more then we are able. For it is better to suffer envie for shewing mercie, then to pretend excuse for inclemencie. As we our selves once incurred envy, because wee did breake up the holy vessels for the redeeming of captives, which deed
<pb facs="tcp:2298:35"/>
displeased the <hi>Arians,</hi> not so much because it was done, as that they might have something for which they might carp at us. For who is so cruel, so yron-hearted, as to be displeased that a man is to be redeemed from Death, a woman from the pollutions of <hi>Barbarians,</hi> which are more grieveous then Death, young maidens, children, Infants from the contagion of Idols where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with (for feare of death) they are in danger to be defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led? Which action though we performed not without sufficient reason, yet we so defended it before the people, that we maintained it to be much more convenient for us to preserve for God, <hi>soules</hi> rather then <hi>gold.</hi> For he who sent his <hi>Apostles</hi> without <hi>gold,</hi> did also without <hi>gold</hi> gather the Churches unto himselfe. The Church hath <hi>gold,</hi> not that it should keepe it, but to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burse it and imploy it for necessarie releifes. What need is there to keepe that which doth not helpe when wee have need? Know you not how much <hi>gold</hi> and <hi>silver</hi> the <hi>Assyrians</hi> carried away from the Temple of the Lord? Is it not better that the Priest should melt up these vessels (if other supplies be wanting) for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe of the poore, then that the Sacrilegious enemie should carrie them away and defile them? Will not the Lord say, why didst thou suffer so many poore men to perish through hunger? Surely seeing thou hadst gold thou shouldest have offered them nourishment. Why are there so many captives carried away to be bought and sould, and are not redeemed? Why are there so many slaine by the Enemy? Better it were that thou preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedst these living vessells, then dead metalls. No an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere can be returned to those obiections. For what
<pb facs="tcp:2298:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wouldst thou say? I feared lest the Temple of God should want ornaments. He will answere thee, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments seeke not gold, neither doe they please the more for gold, which are not purchased with gold. The <hi>adorning of the sacraments is the Redemption of captives.</hi> And verily those vessells are pretious which doe redeeme soules from death. The true treasure of God is that which worketh the same which his blood wrought. I then acknowledg it to be the vessell of the Lords blood, when I finde Redemption in both, that the <hi>Chalice</hi> redeemeth from the enemies those whom the bloud redeemed from sinne. What an excellent thing is it, when multitudes of captives are redeemed by the Church, that it may be said <hi>Those are they whom Christ hath redeemed?</hi> Behold the gold that is tried, the profitable gold, <hi>the gold of Christ</hi> which freeth from death: Behold the gold whereby <hi>Purity</hi> is redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Chastity</hi> is preserved. I had rather present these freed unto you then preserve gold for you. This num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, this order of captives, is a fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re more acceptable sight, then the shew of golden goblets. Thus was the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemers</hi> gold to be imploied, that it should redeeme those who were endangered. I acknowledge the bloud of <hi>Christ</hi> powred into gold, not only to have shined, but to have imprinted the power of divine operation by the gift of redemption.</p>
            <p>Such Gold did the holy <hi>Martyr Laurentius</hi> reserve for the Lord, who, when the treasures of the Church were required of him, promised that he would produce them. Next day he presented the poore, saying, <hi>These
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:2298:36"/>
are the treasures of the Church.</hi> And these truly are treasures, in whom is <hi>Christ,</hi> in whom is the faith of <hi>Christ.</hi>—What better treasures hath <hi>Christ</hi> then those in whom he saith that he himselfe is? For it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> written, <hi>I was hungry and you fed me, I was thirsty and you gave me drinke, I was a stranger and you tooke me in.</hi> And afterward, <hi>That which you have done to one of those, you have done it to me.</hi> What better treasures hath <hi>Iesus</hi> then those in whom he lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to bee seene? These treasures <hi>Laurentius</hi> shew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore <hi>Iehoiachin, who in</hi> the seige kept the gold and imploied it not to provide reliefe, saw the gold to bee violently carried away, and himselfe to be led into captivity. But <hi>Laurentius</hi> who had rather bestowe the <hi>Churches</hi> gold on the poore, then keepe it for the <hi>Persecutor,</hi> according to the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular efficacie of the interpretation of his name, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the sacred <hi>Crowne</hi> of <hi>Martyrdome.</hi> Was it said to holy <hi>Laurentius,</hi> thou oughtest not to have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bursed the treasures of the <hi>Church,</hi> nor to have sold the sacred vessells? Necessary it is, that a man doe dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge that office with sincere faithfulnesse, and discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning providence. Surely if a man doe derive these treasures into his owne advantages, it is iniquitie, but if he bestowe them on the poore, and on the <hi>redemption of captiues,</hi> it is <hi>mercy.</hi> For no man can say, Why doth a poore man liue? No man can complaine because cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives are redemed; no man can accuse because the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God is builded: no man can bee offended because
<pb facs="tcp:2298:36"/>
the earth is opened for the buriall of the bodies of the faithfull, nor grieve because the repose of deceased Christians is procured in their Sepulchres. For these three causes, it is lawfull to breake, to melt, to sell even the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated vessels of the <hi>Church.</hi>
