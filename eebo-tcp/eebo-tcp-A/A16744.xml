            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Foure things alwayes necessarie to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred: to serue God, to despise the World, to prouide for Necessaries, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to die.</p>
            <p>Foure things to be taken heed of, not to fall into: not to creepe to a Dog, to consult with a Wolfe, to trust to a Fox, nor to come in the clawes of a Lion.</p>
            <p>Foure things verie dangerous: to looke too long vpon Beautie, is dangerous for the Eye; to hearken to Treason, is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous for the Eare; to cut a Purse is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous for the Hand; and to delight in
<pb facs="tcp:5896:8"/>
surfeting is dangerous for the bodie.</p>
            <p>Foure old English Games: Trumpe, One and thirtie, Doublers, and Be-you-pleased.</p>
            <p>Foure old English Prouerbs: the Hart loues the High-wood, the Hare loues the Hill, the Gentleman his Sword, and the Yeoman his Bill.</p>
            <p>Foure toyling Pastimes: Foot-ball, Wrastling, Tumbling, and Dancing.</p>
            <p>Foure chiefe horrible sinnes to take heed of: Pride, Lecherie, Murther, and Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse.</p>
            <p>Foure chiefe weapons of the Soule: Faith, Prayer, Hope, and Patience.</p>
            <p>Foure things to bee hated of all Men: a faithlesse Friend, a malicious Woman, a proud Beggar, and a miserable Rich man.</p>
            <p>The foure diuisions of time: the Yeare, the Moneth, the Day, the Houre.</p>
            <p>Foure Diseases incurable: the Falling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicknesse, the Gout, the Frenzie, the Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greene.</p>
            <p>Foure excellent Medicines for all Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases: Patience in the Minde, Peace in the Soule, the Fruits of the Earth, and the Ioyes of Heauen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5896:8"/>Hee that would doe hurt, and dare not, hath more malice than valour; and he that can doe hurt and will not, hath more taste of Heauen than of the world.</p>
            <p>Hee that is full of sorrow, hath no joy in the world; and hee that feareth death, hath a weake faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dauid</hi> was holy, and yet sinned grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uously; <hi>Salomon</hi> was wise, and yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Idolatrie; <hi>Peter</hi> denied <hi>Christ,</hi> but after wept bitterly; and <hi>Marie Magdalen</hi> was a great sinner, and yet loued <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> entirely.</p>
            <p>Feare not to doe well, for the threat of a frowne; nor bee enticed to doe euill, by promise of reward.</p>
            <p>Haue an eye to thy Purse, and an care to thy Doore, a doore to thy Lips, and a care ouer thy Soule.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Pride was drowned in the Sea, <hi>Alexanders</hi> Greatnesse lieth in the graue, <hi>Sampsons</hi> Strength fell into <hi>Dalila's</hi> lap, and <hi>Dines</hi> Riches kept reckoning in hell.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plato</hi> was a diuine Philosopher, <hi>Aristotle</hi> a perfect Logician, <hi>Virgil</hi> an excellent Poet, and <hi>Diogenes</hi> adogged Companion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5896:9"/>Hee that will follow a Multitude, may dance at a May-pole, and he that loues so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarinesse, may dwell in a Cupboard.</p>
            <p>Hee that spends more in one yeare, than he gets in two, may fret out his Heart, when he hath no Mony in his Purse.</p>
            <p>He that vseth Quarrell, had need be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with a Chirurgion &amp; he that is giuen to Drinking, may make his Will in a surfet.</p>
            <p>A gracious Prince is a blessing to the Realme, and a foolish Master is a griefe to his Seruant.</p>
            <p>Meet not a Lion alone in the woods, creep not into a caue to rob a Bear of her whelps, trust not a Wolfe too neere behinde thee, and lose not thy time to play with an Ape.</p>
            <p>A faire Citie without people, a faire Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble without Horse, a faire Pasture without Cattell, and a faire Ship without Mariners, are foure pitifull sights to behold.</p>
            <p>A little Ground well tilled, a little House well filled, and a little Wife well willed, would make him liue that were halfe killed.</p>
            <p>Words are alluring winds, Visions are vaine thoughts, Hopes deceiuing humours, and Loue is a prettie Morris-dance.</p>

            <p>Hee that mournes for euerie trifle, is worthy of trouble, and hee that conceales his sorrow, refuseth comfort.</p>
            <p>Early rising is wholesome for the body, spare diet maintaineth a good stomacke, moderate exercise preserueth health, and a good purse makes a merrie heart.</p>
            <p>Delaying of time is the losse of occasion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and late repentance doth argue indiscretion.</p>
            <p>Love vertue as thy life, it gets thee fame after death, and she sinne as a Serpent, lest it sting like a Deuill.</p>
            <p>Ignorance and Sensualitie, Presumption, and Despaire, are the foure chiefe snares the Deuill layeth for the soule.</p>
            <p>The summer hath her flies, and the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her worme; so hath pride, folly, miserie, and sorrow.</p>
            <p>Loue is sweet, so it bee gouerned with
<pb facs="tcp:5896:10"/>
reason; and friendship is comfortable, when it comes vnlooked for.</p>
            <p>Vertue is the beauty of wit, and Honor the ioy of reason, loue is the life of nature, and grace is the glory of wisdome.</p>
            <p>Time is the plotter of Experience, and Obseruation is the instrument of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p>Who reueales his secrets to his friends, hath his head vnder anothers girdle, and he that scorneth the counsell of the wise, may shake hands with a foole.</p>
            <p>Let the world know thine honesty, thy friend thy kindnesse, thy wife thy loue, and thine heire thy wealth.</p>
            <p>Releeue the distressed, it will be a fame to thy name: aduance the vertuous, it will be an honor to thy spirit: fauour the learned, it may benefit thy knowledge: and loue the Religious, it may be a blessing to thy soule.</p>
            <p>Who heares much and sayes little, who gets much and loseth little, who hath much and spends little, may ioy much and sorrow little.</p>
            <p>Marry not with Age, lest it dislike thee; nor Beauty, least it deceiue thee; nor wealth,
<pb facs="tcp:5896:10"/>
lest it corrupt thee; nor pouertie, lest it em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouerish thee.</p>
            <p>Be not a Peacocke in thy apparel, a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rot in thy speech, a Gander in thy gate, nor a Herne in thy feed.</p>
            <p>Be a Niggard to a Foole, and take heed of a close wit, reward the vertuous in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cresie, and discard the idle as needlesse.</p>
            <p>Vse musicke for recreation, play but for company, labour for exercise, and study but for knowledge.</p>
            <p>An angrie spirit, and a weake body, doe but trouble time, and make ready for the graue.</p>
            <p>A true heart and an honest minde, with a good tongue, make an happie creature.</p>
            <p>Loue a Prince for vertue, a Magistrate for wit, a Judge for conscience, and a Diuine for zeale.</p>
            <p>Pay truly that thou owest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> keepe warily what thou enioyest, giue frankly that thou giuest, and God will blesse what thou hast.</p>
            <p>Grieue not an afflicted spirit, nor boast of thine owne happinesse, trouble not a wounded conscience, and bee patient in thine owne misfortune.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5896:11"/>Follow the Noble, obserue the Wise, accompanie the honest, and loue the Godly.</p>
            <p>Be not subiect to any humour, nor ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate in any errour, nor absolute in thine owne opinion, nor resolute without good aduice.</p>

            <p>Scoffe not a wise Speech in a meane man, scorne not Vertue in a poore habit, refuse not good wine in a woodden cup, nor deny not to take currant money out of a course canuasse bag.</p>
            <p>Wearie not your wits with study, your body with labour, your friend with intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, nor your seruants with rebuke.</p>
            <p>Make not Religion the cloke of an ill Minde, nor a smooth countenance a couer for a subtill meaning, nor a faire word a shadow of an euill deed, nor a gilded pill the couer of poyson.</p>
            <p>

            <p>Striue not with thy betters, for feare of Authoritie; quarrell not vvith thine infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, for feare of Disgrace: but shoulder with thine equall, to maintaine thy Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and take the right on thy side, for feare of the Law.</p>
            <p>Loue not a Tale of Robin Hood and his bow, beat not thy braines about the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of a Riddle, listen to no Ballads of the Fox and the Crow, nor giue credit to newes till they be halfe a yeare old.</p>
            <p>Tell no newes, and write fewer, play not vpon a stranger, and abuse not a friend.</p>
            <p>Chuse a good aire for thy seat, a warme chamber for thy lodging, a faire way to trauell, and an honest man for thine Host.</p>
            <p>Better is one good Horse than many Jades, one good Dog than many Curs, one good Seruant than many Slouens, and one true Friend than many Flatterers.</p>

            <p>There be foure plagues to a good mind: to serue a Foole, to marrie a Slut, to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to a Churle, and not to requite a Friend.</p>
            <p>Learne by a Flie, not to play with the fire: learne by a Fish, not to snatch at a bait: learne by a Bird, not to fall in a snare: and learne by a Mouse, not to creepe into a trap.</p>
            <p>Keepe thy pocket from the Cut-purse, thy stable from the Theefe, thy body from a Harlot, and thy hand from a Bond.</p>
            <p>Follow the Warres for Honour, the Court for Fauour, the Law for Gaine, and the Countrey for Health.</p>
