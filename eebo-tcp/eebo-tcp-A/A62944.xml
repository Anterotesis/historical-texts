         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It was farr in September ere the Magazins were open, the firſt of Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober wee took Shipping, and I referr it over, whether the mediate time could reach to more then a Tumultuary Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline: were they formerly taught by their Proviſionall Officers; yet (if approving all theſe of fit abilitie) where were the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials? where Armes? the word drilling does well diſtinguiſh of what they might attaine to, for though ſome will igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly take this at large, it imports no more then <hi>variis motibus curfitare,</hi> but the Skill of diſtances, of Motions, but the parcell of a tacticke, and if we ſhould yeild them this upon the Cudgell, yet where was the Pike, where the Musket that ſhould embolden <hi>Tom Tyro?</hi> then againe they might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps

till we found a body of Spaniſhhorſe attending upon our Reare, and exacting it with utmoſt cruelty, by the ſlaughter of ſuch as were left behind, either ſtill and ſtupidly ſurfet-ſeized, or elſe ſtarted aſide and improvidently raking up and down for plunder: neither did this outragious Cavalrie thus give over, but ſtill purſued us, though cautiouſlie, and at ſuch a diſtance as they might either take or leave at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; till being jealous of ſuch a neare ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levolent obſerver, and at length haulting upon a neck of land, one way narrowed in by ſome comberous ſalt-pans, and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken marſh grounds, on the other ſide by the ſea, and a maſsie ſteeple-like-building of ſeverall ſtories, we here laid a party of Muſqueteeres in Ambuſcado, ſeeking thus againe to repay theſe bloudy Butchers in their owne coine: the trap was now I ſay fitly laid, we ſtill retreating as before, and our enemies likewiſe inſiſted, ſecurely jog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging on through the narrow neck till very neere a coſtly ſulphurous entertainement, when upon a Souldiers careleſſe blowing

The next day (our former Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade being left at the point to anſwer all Alarmes) an arrant we had up the Paſſe againe, the purport of it to ſeize a diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Long<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>boats for our better accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation when homeward bound; for now the Souldiers began generally to hitch and hummer after their return, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo often and affectionately towards the Fleet, that in our march back we could evidently ſee 7.

theſe creeping out like ſnakes in ſunſhine thus propounded to her in a ſtorme of ball and powder, to which our honourable Countryman Sr <hi>John Watts</hi> (Commander there in chiefe) made likewiſe a ſeaſonable replication; for though his oppoſites fell up to and again, with noiſe enough vapouring out their Ammunition, even when aloofe off, and to little purpoſe; this old and valiant Seaman, nothing moved with the chaffe of their vaine-glory, continued ſtill in ſilence, his quu was not yet come; but having in the meane time travers'd all his peeces of furtheſt randome conveniently, and by this remiſſeneſſe whetted their Spaniſh arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance into danger, he then powred in ſo ſowre a broad ſide upon their bravery, that enough, enough, or (perhaps too much) for market was done already; and they ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pack'd up and home again, with as cold a welcome doubtleſſe as our owne was likewiſe empty at our returne before the Towne: for the belly began here to bark ſo loud for ſuſtenance, and ſo with more noiſe, becauſe the neare ſtorehouſe of our

ſhipping might relieve us now at pleaſure, that hither did vve refer our ſelves, here did vve mediate vvith the ſighs of our Souldiers for reliefe; but this meeting vvith a deafe eare, and ſucceeding not, our laſt refuge vvas either patience, or to value pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous and unnaturall for very vvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and ſavory meat; my ovvn Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny being likevviſe ſo cleare in the point, that a ſupper of <hi>Aſinegoes</hi> fleſh vvrought their extraordinary contentation, vvith a nights reſt ſo free from either invvard di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, or any outvvard ſallies, as better enabled us for our retreat the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. That I may decipher vvhich knotty piece, it vvas conferr'd neceſſarilie upon my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Poore</hi> Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>Valentia,</hi> and Sir <hi>Edward Harwood;</hi> the firſt of theſe vvas in his verie name here ſo formidable, that <hi>Hercules</hi> pillars fell at his arrivall into a ſhaking ague, and but for Sir <hi>Thomas Loves</hi> unhappie interpoſe, he had no doubt out of the ſhipping alone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd a conſiderable victorie; the ſecond hamor'd out his honour in the ſad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtions

of <hi>Ireland,</hi> having his former va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour there, written ſtill and ſignally upon his forehead, in the midſt whereof the full impreſsion of a rigorous bullet was ſo deepely infix'd, as if <hi>Mars</hi> had purpoſely done it to ſet him fairer off; and never has any war (I except none whatſoever) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded a more remakeable, a more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous badge of honour.

this poſture detaine the enemy till our main Groſſe was moſtly ſhip'd againe; but after a long diſpute, being now dangerouſly engaged, and much over-powred; ſome freſh commanded men from the bodies of our reſerve, not only fought the prevailing Enemie into ballance again, but ſoon after from his late gotten ground; and though the command was to retreat, yet our new ſupplies ſtill dapperlie followed and fired upon them, till their Bandeliers coming at length to be recruited, here the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to change upon us, and our raw en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagers with their light matches, ſo ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in ſeverall places blew up our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that at the Huffe our Oppoſites appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending it, were newly whetted into edge, and fell on againe as bitterlie as ever; now was the generall cry throughout the field powder, powder; in the Fort (where like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe my Lord <hi>Marſhall,</hi> and ſome other Commanders were obſerving us) retreat retreat with Orders accordingly, and that the bringers up of our Reare ſhould imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately follow our main Body already ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:35642:23"/>
which conſidering the preſent feare, was with ſpurs and wings ſo very paſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately fulfilled, that being to paſſe my Pikes and Collours firſt aboard, as fraight enough for our little Ship-boat, yet did my Muſquetteers ſo precipitatelie huddle in, ſurcharging and keeping it aground, that I was compell'd (wading the ſea) to trim it againe with my Musketreſt. Neither was it otherwiſe (as before is hinted) with our Souldiers at the point, and now engaged; for what with the ſcarcity of powder, and then the <hi>Calizians</hi> brisk and ſecond charge, had not our Officers, with their rough browes and ſwords, conjur'd this pang of feare into a ſenſe of honour, their heeles had poſsibly been much more nimble than their hands; a diſaſter ſo ſtiflie aimed by the purſuers, that through the broken ground they ſtill beat all along upon our Reare: and about this time was it that for intelligence at the firſt hand, I now left my Musketteers haling themſelves aboard, that I might help wheele up one of our Drake areare, to ſome already at the point;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:35642:23"/>
where I found our enemies ſo riſen high in creſt, that they were now advancing out of covert after us into an open Levell neare the ſea-ſide; but then againe began our little Guns to play with ſo much ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and incuſsion, ſo fatally ſpattering in upon their violence, that they as ſuddenlie relented, and ſhrunke back, locking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up againe in covert; and thus after a paſsionate diſpute of neare foure houres, we wrought out the convenience (though with ſome loſſe,) to quit <hi>Pointall,</hi> and ſhip our ſelves againe in ſafety: for now was all our hope among the briny Billowes, all our confidence in <hi>Neptunes</hi> Kingdome; a wild and open champion I confeſſe, yet where the ſeverall roades were full of pretious ware and ſumptuous plunder; by theſe did <hi>Cortez</hi> heretofore tranſport his golden handmill of 3400 <note n="*" place="margin">A Caſtelane is a Coine weighing a third part more than a Ducat.</note> caſtelanes; his famous golden Colverin, &amp; infinite other treaſure; by theſe came the vaſt eaſt Indie caract of 1000000 ducates taken by our <hi>Leveſon</hi> and <hi>Monſon;</hi> I, here the wealth, here the rarieties of the World are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

tranſient: a motive ſo conſiderable, that though ſome would rather urge for the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Dunſhaul</hi> a rich city in the <hi>Madera</hi> Iland, yet our admirall and the Major voice declining it, our orders were rather to ſtand off to Sea amongſt theſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable paſſes; and in the height of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſix and thirty ſeven the halfe, to bid on ſtill for an honourable welcome home, fortune would perhaps be brought about with importunitie, either mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring to us of the plate Fleet, or ſome ſuch after-game from the ſpiceries, as with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable ſtakes might draw likewiſe an extraordinary reputation; or if the winds ſhould againe ſpit their winter venome, tyrannouſly chaſing us as before, <hi>Budgrave</hi> in the Streights was appointed us Souther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to rally in, Northerly the Iſles of <hi>Bayon.</hi> Nay, we had other ſtormes here alſo to weather out, a dangerous guſt, a perſonall claſh, riſing at this time between Viſcount <hi>Valentia,</hi> and my Lord <hi>de la Ware</hi> Vice-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall to the Head-Squadron, whoſe command being transferr'd upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,

and my Lord not digeſting it, there enſued a peremptorie competition of two red fore-tops borne out, and pretending to the ſame place of honour for ſeverall daies together; till at length a temper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found, and the Viſcount made Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to the ſaid Squadron, with my Lord in his <hi>remitter,</hi> and continuing as before; we bore up unanimouſly to the heights premiſed, there beating to and againe for purchaſe, and to ſnap ſome of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh golden Ingots. Neither was the Scene unfitly laid, ſince <hi>October</hi> the 31. we had three of their Ships in chaſe, and with ſuch a neere capacitie, (as ſome will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port) that had one of our Captaines kept his Luffe, when he bore roome and gave over, they happilie might have defraied all our charges: but to chew this a little, and diſtinguiſh whether it may be ſafely ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed; let me here vouch the Ship in which my own Companie was mounted, one ſo yare of ſaile above others, that my Lord Admirall had formerly own'd, and imploy'd it as his Page; yet was our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition

now ſo ſad and ſober, that though the being in chaſe often ſtarted me from my Cabine 'twas all in vaine, we never could engage; many a faire courſe we had, where there was neither buſh nor brier for the game to <hi>Tapiſh</hi> in, but ſtill loſt ground till we were at laſt run out of ſight; an inſtance ſo roundly pointing out our indiſpoſition, that doubtleſſe he that runs may likewiſe read it, and which muſt needs alſo ſcatter the cloud of prejudice injuriouſlie gathering over Captaine <hi>Osborne.</hi> Nay ſo now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan our Navy to groane under ſeverall diſabilities, that the <hi>Rainbow,</hi> and ſome other of our Shipping, were the eighth of this <hi>November</hi> diſmiſſed againe for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> we which were ſtill behind (though likewiſe in our declination) perſevering as before; neither could the jolting wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try wilderneſſe yet awake us from our ſoft and ſilver dreames, the plate fleet was now indeed our ultimate errand, our immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate maſterpiece; but without any piece of Plate finger'd, ſave one of inferiour value,
