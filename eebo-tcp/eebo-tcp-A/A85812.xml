         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Is Excellence the Earle of Eſſex by order from the High Court of Parliament about the middle of the laſt weeke advancing forward in purſuite of the Cavaliers, firſt to Windſor, and thence to Marlow and Henly upon Thames; from whence Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell <hi>Hurrey</hi> was ſent with the Forces maintained by the City of London, to try if it were poſſible to get beyond Reading to ſtay the Cavaliers in their paſſage thence to Oxford. Upon notice of which intention and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement of the Earle of Eſſex his Excellence procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, the Cavaliers quickly abandoned Reading, retyring in all haſte toward Oxford, about which the main body of their army lay billited, leaving nevertheleſſe in the Towne of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for the ſecurity of it to their part, a conſiderable Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; ſome conjecture 1500 men, under the command of Colonell <hi>Kirke</hi> and others; His Excellence in the interim having certaine notice of the paſſages of the Cavaliers, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed Colonel <hi>Hampden,</hi> and the aforeſaid Colonel <hi>Hurry</hi> in their purſuite, who cut off divers of their ſtraglers, and ſome of their Rere, giving them very frequent and fierce Alarums<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his Excellence remaining ſtill about Marlow and Kingſton upon Thames, intending to ſend ſome other Forces into Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex, where Maſter <hi>Ford</hi> the High Sheriffe with the aſſiſtance of the Earle of Thanet, has raiſed two thouſand men, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them towards the good Towne of Lewes, which has ſtill ſtood faithfull to the Parliament. The aforeſaid Colonels <hi>Hampden</hi> and <hi>Hurry,</hi> with the trained Bands of Buckingham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire and the Londoners Forces, having left the purſuite of the army, retir'd to Reading, intending if it were poſſible, to

reduce that Towne to the obedience of the Parliament by treaty, if not, to accompliſh it by force: and ſo being drawne together in one Body, they ſate downe not far from the Towne, ſending with a Trumpet a Gentleman of quality to demand the ſaid Towne of the Garriſon, promiſing to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe all ſuch as were not noted Malignants, and proſcribed by the Parliament, in ſafety. The Governour Colonell <hi>Kirke</hi> and his aſſociates in great contempt and deriſion anſwered, that they knew not by what or whoſe authority they came to demand that Towne of them, which was His Majeſties, and by His Majeſty to them delivered to be kept for His uſe, which they were reſolv'd to doe againſt all the world, and ſo diſmiſs'd the Trumpet and Gentleman, with many opprobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and uncivill ſpeeches againſt the Parliament and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Forces, bidding them tell thoſe that ſent them they would pay their Round-heads if they came within their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and ſo inſtantly ordered themſelves for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, forcing the honeſt Towneſ-men who had rather have had their roome then their companies, to put on harneſſe and aſſiſt them in manning their workes, which they had before made with as much skill and ſtrength as their Engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers could poſſibly direct. Colonell <hi>Hampden</hi> and Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell <hi>Hurry</hi> reſolute, not to depart without carrying the towne, begun to make their approaches and ſo planted their Cannon that they ſhot into the towne with eaſe, which yet they were loth to doe, leſt they ſhould injure the honeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants. The Cavaleers within anſwered ours with their Ordnance; but our trenches were ſo advantagiouſly ſcitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that they did us but little harme, our men in the meane while playing over into their Workes with their Muskets, made them finde it very hot ſervice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yet their Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, eſpecially Colonell <hi>Kirke,</hi> animating on his own men, and enforcing the townſmen in a manner unto the ſervice, they ſlew ſome few of our men; which rather encouraged then diſheartned the reſt: at laſt, after ſome attempts, as fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies out of their works upon ours, in which they were with very conſiderable loſſe repulſed, the darkneſſe of the night

parted the medley. Colonell <hi>Hampden</hi> and his valiant aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate Colonell <hi>Hurry</hi> ſetting carefull Watches in their Workes, determined as ſoone as it was light to reſalute the Gentlemen with a freſh charge; who (like Cavaleers) ſpent moſt part of the night in carowſing, and ſwearing death and a thouſand confuſions to our forces; and a little before day departed well laden with Wine from their Works to their Lodgings, leaving but a very ſlender Guard in their Works, and thoſe moſt of them Townſmen. Our men in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning admiring the ſolitude and ſilence that was in their Works, informed Colonell <hi>Hampden</hi> of it; who gave imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate order, that ſome Companies of his beſt and moſt reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Souldiers ſhould try if they could force their Works by onſlaught. And ſo faire and ſoftly without leaſt noiſe or tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult foure hundred able men attempted the aſſault, paſſing their ditches without diſcovery, they got upon their Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and ſo fell pell-mell into the Work: The townſmen that were in guard threw downe their armes, and willingly yeelded themſelves to their Friends; the Cavaleers that were in that Work retired to the next<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whither our men pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued them with much reſolution; but there the encounter was different, the Souldiers in that ſtrength being not ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily driven from their ſtations, put back our Souldiers, ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering good ſtore of them in the ditches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that undoubtedly they had been put to the retreat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had not Colonell <hi>Hampden</hi> advanced more men to their ſuccours; who getting up to their companions, and with freſh men ſupplying the places of thoſe that were fallen, they brought the buſineſſe into pretty equall termes, when all the Cavaleers about this time awaked from their drunken humour with the noiſe and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, came ruſhing in like a violent flood to the reſcue of their companions, with their Commander Colonell <hi>Kirke:</hi> But neither their number, nor deſperateneſſe amated the courage of noble Colonell <hi>Hampden,</hi> and his reſolute Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinghamſhire <hi>Militia,</hi> who charged and diſcharged upon them with ſuch fury and nimbleneſſe, that the Cavaleers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to drop on all ſides.
