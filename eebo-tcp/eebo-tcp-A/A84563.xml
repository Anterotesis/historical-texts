            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

AN ACT
Appointing <hi>Thurſday</hi> the laſt Day of <hi>February,</hi> 1649. for
A Solemn day of Humiliation, Faſting &amp; Prayer:
And Declaring the GRO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NDS thereof.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Lord who Ruleth over the Nations, who diſpoſeth and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth
all things, according to the good pleaſure of his own Will,
hath in our Age (as in former Generations) exceedingly glorified
his Wiſdom, Power and Mercy, That he might warn and awaken
the Inhabitants of the Earth unto a diligent enquiry after him,
a faithful and fruitful living before him; His <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>oyce and his Hand
hath been heard, and ſeen in this Land moſt eminently, in reſcuing
Us out of the deſtroying hands of Tyranny, Popery and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition:
Which experience of the Lords wonderful Goodneſs
and Mercy towards this Nation, might have wrought an anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
return of Duty and Obedience; and the ſenſe of the want hereof ought to fill us
with ſhame, aſtoniſhment and confuſion of face, eſpecially when (in ſtead thereof) we
finde in the midſt of it, ſuch crying Sins, hideous Blaſphemies, and unheard of Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
(and that by ſome under pretence of Liberty, and greater meaſure of Light) as
after all our wondrous Deliverances, do manifeſt themſelves to the exceeding diſhonor of
God, and reproach of our Chriſtian Profeſſion: To the end therefore that this Nation
in general, and every one in particular may have an opportunity to know and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
their Sins in the ſight of God, and be truly humbled for them; and that earneſt
Prayer and Supplication may be put up on behalf of this Commonwealth, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement

and all the Dominions thereof; That the good hand of God may be continued with us
in perfecting his great works, which have been carryed on to ſo good a degree in <hi>England</hi>
and <hi>Ireland;</hi> That all Differences among Brethren might be reconciled in love; That the
Deſigns, Combinations and Conſpiracies of all wicked men (whether within or without
us) to imbroil this Nation in a New War, may be diſcovered and prevented; and that
Whileſt ungodly men do make the Arm of Fleſh their Confidence, We may teſtifie (from
an abundant experience of the Lords Goodneſs) That our Strength is onely in the
Living God: Be it therefore Enacted and Declared, That <hi>Thurſday</hi> the laſt day of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi>
1649. be appointed and kept as a Solemn day of Faſting, Prayer and Humiliation,
for the ends aforeſaid.</p>
