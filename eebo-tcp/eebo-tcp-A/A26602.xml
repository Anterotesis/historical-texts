            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

a chargeable and bloody War) into Union with <hi>England,</hi> and inveſting them with all the Liberties and Priviledges thereof (purchaſed at the
Expence of ſo much Blood and Treaſure) and by daily protecting them with their Army and Navy, at a great charge (of which this Nation
under-goeth no more than their equall proportion with <hi>England</hi>) againſt their Enemies both abroad and at home, whereby all of them
might enjoy the fruits and benefits of Peace; Yet diverſe lewd perſons, broken in their fortunes, and diſſolute in their Lives, are run into Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
who being aſſiſted and connived at by their Parents, Brethren, Tuitors, Maſters, and People among whom they live, who ſecretly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
them in their houſes in the day time, and in the night ſuffer them to rob and plunder the Countrey, whereby the Peaceable People of this
Nation are many of them ruined, and the reſt diſturbed, ſo that they cannot live in Peace. And to the end that no Peaceable means might be left unattempted, for
the prevention thereof, I, by vertue of the Authority to me given by His Highneſſe and His Council, do Declare, That all ſuch Perſons that are now in Rebellion,
(except ſuch as are excepted in the Acts of Grace) who ſhall within twenty dayes after the Publication hereof, come in, and ſubmit him or themſelves, to the
Governor of the next <hi>Engliſh</hi> Garriſon, and give good ſecurity for his or their future Peaceable living, ſhall be, and is hereby in his and their perſons, freely par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
for any Offence, Spoil or Plunders committed by him or them in this preſent Rebell on, (the killing of any perſon in cold blood onely excepted.) And I
do Declare, That if any Parents, Brethren, or Tuitors, who have aſſiſted or connived at any their ſons, Brothers, or Pupils, now in Rebellion, as aforeſaid,
ſhall within twenty dayes after Publication hereof, cauſe their ſaid Sons, Brothers, or Pupils, to render themſelves, and give ſecurity, as aforeſaid, That then the
ſaid Parents, Brethren and Tuitors, who have ſo offended, are hereby freely pardoned; But if otherwiſe, then the ſaid Parents, Brethren, and Tuitors, who have
ſo offended, ſhall be impriſoned during the time the ſaid Perſons do remain in Rebellion. And in regard diverſe Perſons who are now in <gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ebellion, and who have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
remote from their friends, but could not probably break out into Rebellion, without the knowledge or conſent of ſome of the Inhabitants of that Pariſh or Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery
where he or they laſt lived, before their breaking forth; I do therefore hereby Declare; That if the ſaid Pariſh or Presbytery where he or they laſt lived, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the ſaid perſon or perſons ſo broken forth, to render him or themſelves, within twenty dayes after Publication hereof, and give ſecurity, as aforeſaid, That then
the ſaid Pariſh or Presbytery ſo offending, is hereby pardoned; But if otherwiſe, I do hereby impoſe upon the ſaid Pariſh and Presbytery, Two ſhillings ſix pence
a-day for each Horſe-man, and Ten pence a-day for each Foot-man, ſo broken into Rebellion, over and above their Ordinary Seſs, out of the ſaid Pariſh or Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
which the Governor of the next <hi>Engliſh</hi> Garriſon is hereby authorized to levie and receive monthly, during the time the ſaid perſons ſhall ſo continue in Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.
And I do likewiſe hereby impower all the good People of this Nation, to apprehend all ſuch perſon and perſons as are, or hereafter ſhall break out into Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or attempt ſo to do, and ſafely to deliver him or them to the Governor of the next <hi>Engliſh</hi> Garriſon; and in caſe of reſiſtance, to take ſuch Weapons as they can
get, and to fight the ſaid perſon or perſons; and if they ſhall kill any of the ſaid perſons ſo reſiſting, they ſhall not be queſtioned for the ſame, but (on the contrary)
ſhall receive as a reward of their good ſervice, all ſuch Moneys, Goods, Horſes, and Cloaths, as the ſaid Rebellious Perſons are then poſſeſſed of, beſides full ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
for their pains and travell therein. And in regard this preſent Rebellion hath been principally contrived, fomented, and is now obſtinatly maintained by Major
Generall <hi>Middleton,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Athol,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Seaforth,</hi> Viſcount <hi>Kenmure,</hi> and Major Generall <hi>Dayell;</hi> I do hereby therefore Declare, That what perſon
or perſons ſoever of this Nation, (except ſuch as are before excepted) ſhall kill any of the ſaid principall Contrivers, or ſhall deliver any of them priſoner, to any
Governor of any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Garriſon, the ſaid perſon or perſons ſo killing, or bringing priſoner, as aforeſaid, ſhall not only be pardoned for any thing he or they have
acted in this late Rebellion, but alſo ſhall receive as a Reward of his good ſervice, the ſum of Two hundred pounds ſterling for every perſon ſo kill'd or brought pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner,
as aforeſaid. And laſtly, for the encouragement of all Peaceable and well-affected People, both <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> I do alſo hereby Declare, That what da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
ſhall be done to their Perſons, Goods or Geer, for their good affection to the Publick, the ſame ſhall be again repaired out of the Eſtates of ſuch as have done
the damage, or out of the Eſtates of the Friends and harbourers of ſuch wrong-doers, or out of the Pariſh, Presbytery, or Shire where the wrong is done, in caſe they
do not apprehend the ſaid Offendors, or give the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces ſuch timely notice thereof, that the ſaid Offendors may be apprehended by them. And I do hereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
all Provoſts, Bailiffs, and Chief Officers of Head-Burghs, in their ſeverall Burghs, to cauſe theſe preſents to be duly Publiſhed and Poſted up, according to the
