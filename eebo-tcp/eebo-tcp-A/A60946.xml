            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THO the following <hi>POEM</hi> was at first <hi>Translated</hi>
for my own <hi>Diversion,</hi> and has lain by a great
while, without any other Design, yet having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to the <hi>Publication</hi> of it, I thought it might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Ceremony of a short <hi>Preface</hi> to Introduce it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Original</hi> was Writ in <hi>Latin</hi> many Years ago, and
having been always esteem'd an <hi>Extraordinary Poem.</hi>
This Consideration, I presume, may be a sufficient Plea
for any One, whose Fancy might incline him to <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate</hi>
it.</p>
            <p>I must confess, that tho' the <hi>Fiction</hi> is very well <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd,</hi>
and contains abundance of <hi>Wit,</hi> yet being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
in <hi>Praise of Musick,</hi> it may be thought an <hi>Unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,</hi>
that the very <hi>Foundation</hi> of the <hi>Story</hi> seems ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly
to oppose the <hi>Reputation</hi> of that <hi>Noble Art:</hi> For
here <hi>Musick</hi> is represented as of dangerous Consequence,
in occasioning the <hi>Distraction</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> of a Young
Man; whereas it may be objected that this <hi>Art</hi> seems
rather Adapted and design'd, for quite <hi>contrary Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
viz.</hi> not only for <hi>Recreating</hi> and <hi>Refreshing</hi> the
<hi>Spirits,</hi> when <hi>depress'd</hi> and <hi>languishing,</hi> but also by a
<pb facs="tcp:106000:3"/>
Charming Efficacy <hi>composing</hi> and <hi>restraining</hi> them from
all <hi>Extravagant Excursions,</hi> and by this means, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>Opinion</hi> (if not <hi>Experience</hi>) of the <hi>Antients,</hi>
by degrees effecting a <hi>Serious Conformation</hi> of the
<hi>Mind</hi> to the <hi>right Notion</hi> of <hi>Things,</hi> and consequently
an <hi>Aptitude</hi> and <hi>Inclination</hi> to the Practice of <hi>Moral
Vertues.</hi> All this must certainly be granted, and yet that
<hi>Musick</hi> might by chance have as ill Effect as is described
in the following <hi>Poem,</hi> may be no <gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>reat <hi>Derogation</hi>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t;</hi> but only represents to
us, that like a <hi>Good Medicine,</hi> tho' it is of <hi>great efficacy,</hi>
yet still it may be <hi>injudiciously</hi> apply'd.</p>
            <p>That different Sorts of <hi>Musick</hi> may be contriv'd so
as to have <hi>contrary Effects,</hi> our own Experience may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
us; for as the <hi>Grave Air</hi> does by a powerful <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy</hi>
depress us to <hi>Sadness,</hi> so Quicker and more <hi>Spright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Strains,</hi> with a proper <hi>Rythmus</hi> do equally excite the
Spirits to a <hi>chearful</hi> and <hi>delightful Temper.</hi> And in
like manner <hi>Antient Philosophers,</hi> particularly the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonists</hi>
and <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> inform us, that it was in the
<hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Musick,</hi> us'd in their Time, to incline the
<hi>Mind</hi> either to <hi>Vertue</hi> or <hi>Vice.</hi> And thus tho' <hi>They</hi>
greatly esteemed, and recommended this <hi>Art</hi> in General, yet
still it was with this Caution, that some sorts of <hi>Airs</hi> were
<hi>dangerous</hi> to <hi>Morality.</hi> And thus also we meet with
some Instances recorded by <hi>Antient Authors,</hi> that this
<hi>Art</hi> has been so managed, as both to <hi>Cause</hi> and <hi>Cure
Madness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Story of <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Timotheus</hi> is commonly
known. <hi>Jamblicus</hi> in his <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Pythagoras, Chap.</hi>
XXV. and <hi>Boethius, in Presat. Mus. both</hi> speak of a
Young Man, who by the <hi>Phrygian Kind</hi> of <hi>Musick</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<hi>Distracted,</hi> and afterwards by <hi>Doric Measures</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:106000:3"/>
was <hi>reduc'd</hi> again to his <hi>Right Senses.</hi> And <hi>Galen</hi> from
the Testimony of <hi>Posidonius</hi> writes to the same Effect,
that <hi>Damon</hi> of <hi>Miletus</hi> happening to come where a <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician</hi> by <hi>Phrygian Airs</hi> had Incens'd his Hearers to
Madness, directing the Artist to <hi>change his Hand</hi> and
play a <hi>grave Doric Strain,</hi> they were thereby charm'd
into a <hi>Tranquillity</hi> and <hi>Composedness</hi> of Mind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saxo Grammaticus,</hi> an <hi>Ancient Historian, Lib. XII.
Historiae Danicae.</hi> tells us of a certain Danish King, who
by the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Musick</hi> became Distracted. The
<hi>Story</hi> may seem more remarkable if we consider the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
as they are there related, which are to this Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
            <p>It happen'd, that among several <hi>Musicians</hi> that attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>King</hi> at Supper, there was One most <hi>Eminent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist,</hi>
who, upon a Dispute about the <hi>Force</hi> of <hi>Musick,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ask'd whether it was in the <hi>Power</hi> of his <hi>Art</hi> to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
a <hi>Man</hi> to <hi>Rage</hi> and <hi>Fury,</hi> affirm'd it <hi>possible,</hi> and
being afterwards question'd, whether he knew the <hi>Way</hi>
or <hi>Method</hi> of such a <hi>Performance,</hi> confess'd he did:
Whereupon the <hi>King,</hi> being <hi>curious</hi> to <hi>Try</hi> the <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
desired, and at last by <hi>Threats</hi> compell'd <hi>Him</hi> to
use his utmost <hi>Endeavours</hi> to perform what he pretended
to. The <hi>Musician</hi> perceiving no way of <hi>Declining</hi> the
<hi>Undertaking,</hi> order'd that all <hi>Arms</hi> and <hi>dangerous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments</hi> should be remov'd out of the <hi>Room,</hi> and that
several Persons, placed out of the Sound of his <hi>Musick,</hi>
as soon as they heard any extraordinary Noise, should
break open the <hi>Doors,</hi> to prevent what <hi>Mischief</hi> might
happen. And this being accordingly done, he began so
<hi>Grave</hi> a <hi>Strain,</hi> that it presently fill'd the <hi>Hearers</hi> with
<hi>Sadness,</hi> and lull'd their Spirits into a <hi>deep Supefaction:</hi>
After he had thus play'd a convenient Time, by a <hi>Brisker</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:106000:4"/>
and more <hi>Sprightly</hi> sort of <hi>Musick;</hi> he rais'd them from
their. <hi>Dullness</hi> to a <hi>chearful Temper,</hi> so that being cured
of their <hi>Melancholy</hi> they were now <hi>Dancing</hi> for <hi>Joy:</hi>
At last running over a <hi>confus'd Division</hi> with a most <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent
quickness,</hi> he made them so <hi>Impatient,</hi> that they
fill'd the House with Clamours; such an <hi>absolute</hi> Power
had the <hi>Variety of Sounds</hi> over the <hi>Affections</hi> of their
<hi>Mind.</hi> When those therefore that were without, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
that the <hi>King,</hi> and they that were with him, were
grown <hi>Furious;</hi> they broke open the Doors, and took hold
of the <hi>King,</hi> to secure him from doing himself a <hi>Mischief.</hi>
But He, being <hi>incens'd</hi> and <hi>strengthen'd</hi> with <hi>Passion,</hi>
threw himself out of their Arms, and having got a <hi>Sword,</hi>
presently <hi>Killed</hi> Four of his <hi>Guards,</hi> that were next him,
and by a greater Number of <hi>Them,</hi> not without their
great <hi>Danger,</hi> was at last over-power'd.</p>
            <p>This <hi>strange Relation</hi> our <hi>Historian</hi> confirms by this
memorable Instance, that it occasion'd a <hi>Revolution</hi> in the
<hi>Goverment.</hi> For the <hi>King,</hi> when reduced to his <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
being very <hi>Sorry</hi> for the Ill he had done; for the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation</hi>
of his <hi>Crime,</hi> enjoyn'd Himself a <hi>Religious Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage,</hi>
designing to visit the <hi>Holy-Land:</hi> And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
having Committed the <hi>Administration</hi> of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment</hi>
to his Son <hi>Haraldus;</hi> in his <hi>Travels</hi> he dy'd,
and was <hi>Bury'd</hi> in the <hi>Island</hi> of <hi>Cyprus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I must leave the <hi>Reader</hi> to his own <hi>Liberty,</hi> whether
he will believe this to be <hi>matter of Fact,</hi> or no; I shall
not Vouch for the <hi>Historian.</hi> Tho' I might <hi>Expostulate</hi>
in his behalf, what Interest he could have to mention such
an Vntruth, and to confirm it by such Remarkable Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances.</p>
            <p>But, what is most to our present Purpose, I shall offer
some Reasons for supposing that the <hi>Musick</hi> of the
<pb facs="tcp:106000:4"/>
               <hi>Antients might possibly be so managed as to cause
Madness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And first of all, it is not to be imagin'd how <hi>great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi>
of this <hi>Art</hi> they might have arriv'd to, by <hi>long
Practice,</hi> and those <hi>Improvements</hi> which so many <hi>Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Men,</hi> for <hi>several Ages,</hi> must successively have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
especially considering the vast <hi>Scope</hi> of the <hi>Antient
Musick,</hi> when compar'd to the <hi>Modern.</hi> 'Tis probable,
that the <hi>Art of Composing in Parts,</hi> may now be better
<hi>Understood</hi> and <hi>Practic'd,</hi> than it was in their Time:
But it must be supposed that while they <hi>neglected</hi> this
<hi>Part</hi> of <hi>Musick;</hi> they might <hi>improve</hi> their <hi>Art</hi> to a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Influence</hi> over the <hi>Fancy</hi> by a long <hi>Study</hi> and <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi>
in the <hi>several Kinds</hi> of <hi>Musick:</hi> And this will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
more <hi>Probable,</hi> if we consider that the <hi>Chromatic</hi>
and <hi>Enharmonic Kinds,</hi> (which are not much us'd by
<hi>Modern Musicians,</hi>) seem to be adapted to affect the
<hi>Imagination</hi> with greater <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Efficacy,</hi> than the
<hi>Diatonic Genus,</hi> which is now <hi>chiefly</hi> practic'd.</p>
            <p>And Dr. <hi>Holder,</hi> in his <hi>Treatise concerning the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Grounds and Principles of Harmony,</hi> confirms the
same Opinion in these Words.</p>
            <p>This way of theirs, seems to be more proper (by
the Elaborate Curiosity, and Nicety of Contrivance
of Degrees, and by Measures, rather than by Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
Consonancy; and by long study'd Performance)
to make great Impressions upon the Fancy, and <hi>Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
accordingly, as some</hi> Histories <hi>relate:</hi> Ours more
sedately affects the Understanding and Judgment from
the Judicious contrivance and happy Composition of
Melodius Consort. The One quietly but powerfully
affects the Intellect, by true Harmony: The Other
<pb facs="tcp:106000:5"/>
chiefly by the <hi>Rythmus,</hi> violently attacks and hurries
the Imagination.</p>
            <p>Having thus considered the <hi>Art of Musick</hi> in <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;</hi>
if we inquire into the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Properties</hi> of
<hi>Sounds,</hi> we may with greater <hi>Certainty</hi> guess their
<hi>Effects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That they Cure the <hi>Sting</hi> of the <hi>Tarantula,</hi> is a <hi>Truth</hi>
so generally <hi>receiv'd,</hi> and <hi>confirm'd,</hi> by several <hi>Persons,</hi>
that have been <hi>Eye-Witnesses</hi> of it in some parts of
<hi>Italy,</hi> That it may be no unworthy <hi>Employment</hi> of our
<hi>Thoughts,</hi> to enquire into the <hi>manner</hi> of this their <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration,</hi>
And in the first place we may reasonably sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
that this <hi>Malady</hi> does partly proceed from a <hi>great
Effervescence</hi> of the <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> of the <hi>Insect,</hi> actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
by a <hi>Violent Intention,</hi> as it is in <hi>Mad Dogs,</hi> and
<hi>Communicated</hi> by the <hi>Sting</hi> to the <hi>Patient. Secondly,</hi>
by the Effects we may perceive, that the <hi>Poyson</hi> receiv'd
chiefly affects the Spirits, the <hi>Symptom</hi> discover'd being
only a <hi>Frenzy.</hi> And lastly, considering the <hi>Quantity</hi> of
the <hi>Poysonous Matter</hi> compar'd to that of the whole
<hi>Mass</hi> of <hi>Blood,</hi> we may conclude that It is neither <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd</hi>
nor <hi>qualified</hi> to <hi>Disorder,</hi> any thing but the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal
Spirits,</hi> and that this <hi>Disorder,</hi> as in all other <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations,</hi>
chiefly consists in a <hi>too Violent</hi> and <hi>Preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
Motion.</hi> Now if <hi>Musick</hi> Cures this <hi>Distemper</hi>
by Actuating the <hi>Spirits</hi> so as to <hi>oppose</hi> the <hi>Incursion</hi> of
the <hi>Poyson,</hi> It may be, as it is in <hi>Women,</hi> in a <hi>longing
Condition,</hi> when the <hi>Imagination</hi> directs the <hi>Animal
Spirits</hi> to <hi>collect</hi> and <hi>compose</hi> out of the Blood of the
<hi>Parent</hi> such Particles as come nearest to the Thing long'd
for, in outward appearance; the <hi>Imagination</hi> always act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
according to the <hi>Sense</hi> that informs it; these Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
being thus muster'd up to supply the <hi>Foetus</hi> with what
<pb facs="tcp:106000:5"/>
               <hi>Nature</hi> seems to Want; they are fix'd by the Spirits
and <hi>Mark</hi> the <hi>same Part</hi> of the <hi>Child's Body,</hi> as
the <hi>Mother</hi> chances first to think of, or touch of her <hi>own,</hi>
this <hi>Accident</hi> determining and <hi>directing</hi> the <hi>Operation</hi>
of the <hi>Spirits,</hi> by the <hi>resemblance</hi> of the Parts to the <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</hi>
And thus possibly <hi>Musical Sounds</hi> may <hi>streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi>
and <hi>empower</hi> the <hi>Imagination</hi> to employ the <hi>Spirits</hi>
so as to gather out of the <hi>Blood</hi> such <hi>Principles</hi> as may
<hi>resist</hi> and <hi>oppose</hi> the <hi>Contagion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But since we suppos'd that the <hi>Sting</hi> of the <hi>Tarantula</hi>
only causes an <hi>extraordinary commotion</hi> of the <hi>Animal
Spirits,</hi> it seems <hi>most probable</hi> that Musick by such an
Influence as that whereby it inclines us to <hi>Sadness,</hi> may
be adapted to <hi>allay</hi> or <hi>restrain</hi> that <hi>unnatural Efferve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence,</hi>
till <hi>Nature</hi> has disperst or wrought off the <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative
Matter;</hi> and thus it seems <hi>most reasonable</hi> to
believe, that the <hi>Cure</hi> of the <hi>Bite</hi> of the <hi>Tarantula</hi> is ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
            <p>Now from this Consideration of <hi>Musical Sounds,</hi> we
may infer, that they may be also <hi>capable</hi> of <hi>producing
contrary Effects:</hi> For if They can thus <hi>allay</hi> and <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate</hi>
the <hi>Motion</hi> of the <hi>Spirits</hi> when in a <hi>high Frenzy,</hi>
'tis <hi>equally probable</hi> that by <hi>contrary measures</hi> they
may <hi>excite</hi> Them to as great a <hi>Distraction.</hi> Nay, the
<hi>Musick</hi> of the <hi>Antients,</hi> as we have before represented
it, seems more adapted to Cause than to Cure <hi>Madness,</hi>
not only upon the Account of its <hi>Variety,</hi> but even from
our <hi>own Observation</hi> that the <hi>sprightly Air</hi> more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<hi>elevates</hi> the <hi>Spirits,</hi> than the <hi>Grave Composition
depresses</hi> and <hi>restrains</hi> Their <hi>Motion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it may appear an <hi>unreasonable Suspicion</hi> to <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust</hi>
the <hi>Concurring Testimony</hi> of <hi>Antient Authors</hi>
concerning the Wonderful Operation of <hi>Musick</hi> upon the
<pb facs="tcp:106000:6"/>
               <hi>Mind,</hi> if we <hi>reflect</hi> upon the <hi>Exquisiteness</hi> of the <hi>Sense,</hi>
which it <hi>affects.</hi> For the <hi>Objects</hi> of the <hi>Visive Faculty</hi>
are so <hi>Imaginary</hi> and <hi>Intellectual,</hi> that they produce in us
rather a <hi>Perception</hi> than a <hi>Sensation;</hi> and on the other
Hand, the <hi>Inferiour Senses</hi> are <hi>Gross</hi> and <hi>Material;</hi>
whereas <hi>Harmonious Sounds</hi> Act with <hi>greater</hi> and <hi>Nobler
Force</hi> upon the <hi>Ear;</hi> for <hi>Insinuating</hi> themselves into the
<hi>Affections,</hi> 
               <unclear>by</unclear> 
               <hi>co-operating</hi> with the <hi>Motions</hi> of the <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Spirits,</hi> they gain a great <hi>Influence</hi> both over <hi>Soul</hi> and
<hi>Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we have taken a <hi>short</hi> and <hi>Transient View</hi> of the
<hi>Natural Effects of Musick upon the Mind,</hi> as far as
might be pertinent to our present <hi>Purpose,</hi> as well for the
<hi>Curiosity</hi> of the <hi>Subject,</hi> as to advance the following
