            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen you intend to undertake this profitable Labour and Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; conſider the Meadow how it lies, low or high, upon a level or deſcending, and whether any River or Ditch lie convenient to water it or not; and if it be by a River, if you can convey the Water out again ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving once turned it over the Meadow, then be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the burden it bears, whether Spiry, or Ruſhy, or Clean, being only over-topped with abundance of Moſs; if the Medow lie deſcending, you have a great deal the advantage of a flat Medow, by reaſon the Water having over-flowed the Meadow ſome certain time, leaves a great ſoyl after a ſudden Rain,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103298:4"/>
and upon the fall of the Water ſinks from the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and ſo the Meadow becomes dry with little or no trouble, and ſo the Water not lying long up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Meadow (without it runs) makes the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow become very fruitful; which if it lay ſome certain time without draining, would ſo chill the Ground, that it would not be one farthing advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage for the watering. Now the flat Meadow that lies lower than the River muſt be ordered thus; You muſt make one large Drain through the middle of the Meadow, and ſeveral leading Drains to it, then the River lying higher, the Meadow will over-flow with little trouble: But then the chief Work and Labour will be how to drain this Meadow dry, that ſo the Water may not lie ſugging upon the Ground; it not only makes the Ground breed Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy and Spiry Graſs, but alſo it will prove ſo rotten, that it will not bear a Cart to carry off its Burden, therfore order it thus: Having made your Trenches, and a large one in the loweſt part of the Meadow, if any be, then having a large Trench made to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry about a foot Water, if you can make it out of a whole piece of Wood or Timber, for it is much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Planks, and will laſt far longer; when you have hewed your piece of Timber, made it with what Current you can, then clap a good Plank to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at top with Pitch and Tow, then nail him while it is warm, and it will lie many years before it decay; having thus fitted your Current to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the Water from your flat Meadow, lay him croſs that River two foot lower than the bottom of the Meadow, and then the Water will drain under the River into the next Ground, where you muſt make a large Drain or ſmall Ditch to convey it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103298:4"/>
where you may have more conveniency to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of your Water; theſe low Meadows which are commonly the worſt by reaſon the Water lies on till the heat of the Sun dries it off, which if the Water could be conveyed off quickly, would be extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary rich, which I never could ſee a better way in all my Travels than this, to perform with ſpeed and cheapneſs; they throw out the Water of flat Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows in <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Spruſia</hi> over the Banks with certain Wind-mills, which is a great deal of trouble and charge. Having now finiſhed this Work, to lay your Meadow dry when your pleaſure is, without it be extraordinary Rainy Weather, the next thing is to deſtroy your Moſs, Ruſhes and Spiery Graſs, which moſt Meadows that lie low are ſubject to: Towards the latter end of <hi>February</hi> ſcour all your Drains both great and ſmall, and lay it as dry as poſſibly may be, (mending the Banks of the River, if any be wanting againſt <hi>March,</hi> which very ſeldom proves otherwiſe than a very dry windy month; when you have layed it dry for ſome certain time, and you ſhall then begin to perceive the Moſs and Rowel to grow Ruſſet and Dry, then obſerving your time to be dry and windy, carry down a bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of Straw or Fern, ſtrew it upon one ſide, that ſo having ſet it on fire the Wind may drive it quite through the Meadow; and where you perceive the Moſs any thing damp or wet, ſtrew ſome Straw or Fern upon it, and ſet it on Fire, and you will find in a ſhort time your Meadows to be burnt as ſmooth as a Bowling-Green. Having thus devoured by fire your Moſs and courſe Graſs, then with a Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, harrow your Meadow over once or twice, then take ſome Hay-Seeds and ſow up and down
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103298:5"/>
the Meadow, then with the Mold that comes out of the cleanſing of the Ditches, ſpread all over the Meadow, that ſo the Hay-Seeds may be covered; and when you find the Hay-Seeds ſprung up and ſettled, if the weather be very dry, you may turn the Water over for a night, and turn it out again, and be ſure you leave no ſtanding Water, for that will preſently kill the young Graſs. Obſerving theſe Rules, the next year you will find that Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that one Acre will be worth two, and a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble burthen with much better Graſs; for the Moſs being burnt away with the heat of the fire, which will ſo purifie the Mold, and alſo Hay-Seeds being ſown, will ſpring up with the tender Graſs, which before the Moſs would never ſuffer to ſpring up: This truly managed, hath proved beyond what ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral have expected.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <head>How to deſtroy Moles, being the quickeſt and beſt way at preſent diſcovered.</head>
               <p>IN the firſt place you muſt have a Paddle, which muſt be put upon a Stick five or ſix foot long; I need not deſcribe which way to make a Paddle, for there be but few which do not know how to give directions to have them made according to their minds, for there be ſeveral faſhions, but they tend all to one thing, which is the diſcovery of the Moles haunts; Taking your Paddle, go out in a morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and walk round your Grounds, and ſee what Haunts be towards the Ditches and Banks, and when you have diſcovered the Trenches with your Paddle, tread them down, but not too hard; then look into the middle of your Grounds, and view if
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103298:5"/>
no Hills be new raiſed; which when you find, and the principal Trench leading to it; having digged with your Paddle the Earth into the Trench, tread it down with your foot indifferent hard, and ſo go over all your Ground after the ſame manner, looking very well the Ditches and Bank-ſides, for if it be a ſmall Ground, though he have many Hills in the middle, yet it is ten to one but he hath a main Trench leading to the Bank or Hedg: Having thus prepared your Grounds, get Weathy or any other Wood, as Alder, boared the bigneſs of a Mole, and the length of a Mole, (they are bought for eighteen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence a dozen ready made); but being a pleaſure to make them in the Winter nights, I ſhall endeavour to give you the plaineſt directions I can; Having ſome Alder or Weathy about the bigneſs of the ſmall of ones Leg, ſaw them into pieces about five inches long, then bore them through with an Auger, one bigger than another, till you think he may be the bigneſs of a Mole, then ſaw him half through, leaving an inch and half at each end, ſo the piece that comes out will be two inches, you may cleave it off with a Chiſſel; with your Piercer bore a hole juſt in the middle and at each end. When your Traps are finiſhed, hang them up in the Chimney corner that ſo they may grow dry and tough; you muſt at each end at the inſide of the Trap, about half an inch from the end, make a round Ring about half a quarter of an inch deep, that the Hair may lie in the Hollow at each end, that ſo the Mole coming in may not ſlide or drive the Hair before him: Then go into ſome young Cops, and cut twenty or thirty Taper-Haſle or Dogwood-benders, ſuch as are uſed to be ſet in Springes for Woodcocks or Snipes, then
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103298:6"/>
twiſt fifty or ſixty Horſe-hairs together, about half a yard long, then tie a ſtrong piece of Packthread to both the links of Hair, that ſo the Benders may ſtrike both at one time; in the Holes at each end of the Trap that was made with the Piercer, you muſt put in each link of Hair, and fit them to the Circle that was made hollow at each end, that ſo the Mole paſſing through the Hair may not put it out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. When the Hair is exactly in, fill up the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Circle with a little Earth or Clay, that ſo the Mole may not draw the Hair out with his Claws as he paſſes by.</p>
               <p>The Hole that is in the middle of the Trap, ſerves to keep the Benders ſtreight; you muſt put in one end of the Packthread that is faſtned to the Bender; you muſt leave an inch of Packthread to go through the Hole, and you muſt faſten it with a forked ſtick, about two inches long, the Fork an inch long, and the other ſtreight part an inch more; the Fork muſt ſtand within the ſide of the Trap, exactly perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular when it is ſet: It is the Nature of a Mole to turn any thing out of the way with his Noſe and Feet that lies in his Trench; ſo as ſoon as ever the Mole finds a ſtop, he works out the Stake with his Noſe and Feet; and before ever he is able to retreat backwards, the Benders ſtrike and very ſeldom fails to hang him by the Middle, and never by the Neck, (as ſome have written); You muſt be ſure to make the Trap faſt into the Ground, otherwiſe the Bender will be ſubject to put the Trap out; you may faſten it with Stones put at each ſide of the Trap, or ſmall Turfs, or forked Sticks; cover it very cloſe that no light may come to it to make the Mole fearful. After you have thus planted a dozen
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103298:6"/>
or more, according as your Grounds are infected, once a day you may look over them, and ſee what execution is done; they will ſtand four or five days without altering if the Benders be good. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens now and then, through the rottenneſs of the Hair-grins, that a Mole when he hath been hanged, with much ſtrugling breaks the Hair-grin; and then he grows ſo cunning that he will hardly ever come through again, but continually heave up the Trap out of the Ground: I have ſeen ſet in a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den three Traps, in his Trench, one within a yard of another, and he hath heaved them all out of the ground; Therefore I would adviſe you to have a Spike Trap or two, that ſo when a Mole hath been bauked with one of theſe Box Traps, the Spiked one will not fail to have him; theſe Spike Traps are ſo generally known and made, that there needs no deſcription: only by the way, have ſix Spikes to a Trap, and let them ſtand triangular at each end, and you will not fail of him; let your Spikes be round and not ſquare, and they will go into the Ground eaſier and quicker than your ſquare.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <head>Another way of taking Moles in <hi>March</hi> time.</head>
               <p>AFter you have taken a Doe-Mole, which you cannot fail once in two or three days, then get a good handſom earthen Pot about twenty inches deep, and having made a hole in the middle of a main Trench, plant the Pot that the top may be juſt even with the bottom of the Trench, then fill it half full of Mold, and put ſome great Worms in, then put in the Doe-Mole, (if you ſhould not put in Earth and Worms, the Mole would work
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103298:7"/>
her ſelf to death in twelve hours, as I have often tryed) but firſt rub her about the top of the Pot, and let her run of each ſide of the Trench, then force her into the Pot; thoſe that know the nature of your Buck-Moles, that at <hi>March</hi> they will run a quarter of a mile after a Doe, and you will find in a ſhort time, that not one Buck-Mole will be left in the Ground where the Pots are ſet; you muſt cover the Pot very cloſe that no light comes in, for if any light appears, it will ſo ſtartle the Mole that he will be very cautious to venture; the Doe-Mole will live all the month of <hi>March</hi> if you now and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow a few Worms upon her; every time you give her Worms, you may ſearch the Pot to ſee what company ſhe hath got: This is an approved Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit.</p>

you will not fail of your expectation; I aſſure you I have ſeen it experimented.</p>
               <p>Now to perform this, you muſt have a very ſharp thin Knife, and ſome Cruel, Yarn or Worſted, which muſt be to binde the Tulips when cut; then get ſome of your fineſt ſort of Clay, and mix it well with Cow-Dung, let it be of an exact temper, neither too limber nor too thick. Now having all your things ready, being two of you together, match out certain Roots of Tulips which are of one Nature, their Leaves coming alike, and blow at the ſame time and ſeaſon; and as near as you can gueſs, of one forwardneſs and one bigneſs. I ſhall only inſtance two ſorts of Tulips, which are your Yellow Crown or Fools-Coat and White Crown, which are of one Nature, that is, the make of the Tulip is alike, and come always together. Having now choſe out certain Roots of one bigneſs, length and forwardneſs of each ſort, take your Knife and cut the Tulip as exactly as can be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble juſt in the midſt of both your Roots, and ſlit the very Spindle of each; then immediately clap them up together, that is, one half of the Yellow Crown, and the other half of the White Crown; do not leave them open when you have ſlit them, but hold them together till you have all your things ready, for if the leaſt Wind take them they will not joyn; then when all is ready, take you half the Yellow Crown, and give your Companion half the White Crown; then having regard to the Spin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, be ſure to clap or joyn them exactly; then with your Cruel, or Yarn, or Worſted, tie the Root ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry firm together; then clay them up very well all over, and lay them by for a weak or ten days; then
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103298:8"/>
cut the Clay from the bottom and top, that ſo the Roots may ſhoot out, and the Spindle alſo, for the Roots and the Spindle will be very faint for the firſt year; as ſoon as you have cut the Clay from the top and bottom, ſet them into the Ground, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Earth, ſo that the Froſt may not frieze the Earth about them; for if they be frozen all your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is loſt, they ſeldom come up with more than one Leaf, for the firſt year, for very little more than the Spindle of your Root joyns together, without the Roots match very exactly; but we never regard only the Spindle joyning, which cauſes the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Flower; you will find the Roots not like other of ſets, for theſe will be long like a Date<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone; when you have taken them out of the Ground, put them into Sand, that ſo the Wind may not come at them to ſhrink them.</p>

               <head>Concerning Fiſh and Fiſh-Ponds, how to improve them.</head>
               <p>IN the firſt place you muſt conſider the ſcituation of your Pond, and what feed will ariſe by any Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of Water to it; then whether it be a Breeder or not: Now if your Pond be a Breeder, then you muſt expect to have no large Carps, for the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of their young will over-ſtock the Pond, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Store Pond is ever accounted better than a Breeder; but obſerving this Rule, you may make a Breeding Pond become a Store Pond, when you cannot make a Store Pond become a Breeding one, and you ſhall have a gallanter grown Fiſh out of your Breeding Pond, than out of your Store: When you ſue your Pond, conſider how many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103298:8"/>
of Carps it will keep; then put in all Milters or all Spawners, ſo you will have in a ſhort time, large, well-grown fat Fiſh, far above your expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for putting all Milters, or all Spawners, there will be no encreaſe of Carps, but of other Fiſh they may abundantly multiply, which is a Fiſh cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Roach: Therefore I would adviſe all Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that have Breeding Ponds, to ſue them once in two or three years for fear of Roaches, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any were put in, which may ſeem a Riddle, but I ſhall quickly unfold it; There be ſeveral Ponds which are haunted by your Wild-Ducks which uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally come at Nights to feed with the Tame ones that belong to the Ponds, now theſe Roches are brought by the Wild-Ducks, for the feeding amongſt your Weeds in Rivers, the Spawn of your Roaches will hang about their Feathers and Feet; and they uſing to come at night to the Ponds to feed, waſheth off the Spawn from their Feathers and Feet, that ſo in a few years (though you put not one Roch in) you may find multitudes of them, and lean ſtarved Carps; therefore if you have any ſuch ſuſpition that your Pond is infected, immediately cauſe it to be ſued, for the longer you carry, the worſe your Carps will prove. I ſhall relate a very true thing that I was an eye witneſs of; A Gentleman not far from <hi>London,</hi> had a good handſom large Pond of about three or four Acres of Ground, which I was preſent at the ſuing, and I never ſaw better grown Fiſh every way than he had, being betwixt two and three hundred; I adviſed him to put in two or three hundred of ſtores of Carp about three or four years growth out of a Pond that was over-ſtocked, and to put ſixty of thoſe he had taken out, which
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103298:9"/>
accordingly I ſaw done, for I did fancy to have ſtately Carps the next ſuing. Now after four years was expired, I adviſed him to ſue his Pond to ſee what Monſters four years addition to their growth would produce, thoſe ſixty Carps were from Eye to Fork from fifteen inches to eighteen inches when he put them in; now having ſued his Pond, he found almoſt the whole number of his Carps, but they were in ſuch a lean condition that he did not know them, for they were Monſters in Nature, for their Heads were bigger than their whole Bodies, and I think almoſt as heavy; and all this came by his own folly, by putting in but twenty Roches; and when the Pond was ſued, there were buſhels of ſmall Roches, and theſe Roches cat up all the ſweet Feed from the Carps, for Roches are like Sheep to great Cattel, which eat up and devour all the ſweet Feed. The Gentleman was very much fruſtrated in his expectation, and the Fiſhmonger which came from <hi>London</hi> to buy a penny-worth; as ſoon as he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Monſters, got up his Horſe as one frighted with a ſtrange Apparition, and never bid the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman farewel. Now pray obſerve one thing by the way, That Ponds which will not breed one Carp, Roches in one year will multiply by thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands; therefore there is a care to be taken every year to view your Pond, and obſerve if any ſmall Fry appears, leaſt when you come to ſue your Pond, you be deceived in your expectation.</p>

               <head>How to make Carps grow to an extraordinary bigneſs and length.</head>
               <p>WHen you find your Pond begin to grow low in Water, which is commonly about <hi>April,</hi> then take an Iron Rake and rake all the ſides of your Pond where the Water is fallen away; then ſow your Hay-Seeds and rake it well, and you ſhall find by the latter end of Summer there will be a very great growth of Graſs; which when Winter comes, and the Pond being raiſed by Rain to the top, will over-flow all that Graſs; and then the Carps ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Water to carry themſelves to the feed, will fill themſelves, and in a ſhort time become as fat as Hogs that are put up a fatting; ſo ſerve it every Summer till you ſue your Pond, and you will find no River Carp to ſurpaſs them in fatneſs and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and then I am confident you ſhall have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to complain of your charge and trouble; I will prove, that ordering your Ponds thus, that two years ſhall be as good as four. This is an approved way to make Carps thrive.</p>

               <head>An approved way how to take Carps or Tench in a Muddy Pond.</head>
               <p>I Do not write this enſuing Secret to teach Men how to Rob Gentlemens Ponds, but that Maſters of their own Ponds may be able upon caſes of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to ſupply themſelves with Fiſh, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put to ſo much trouble and charge as to ſue their Ponds: In the firſt place you muſt provide your ſelf with a very large good Caſting-Net, well
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103298:10"/>
leaded, let not the Meſhes from the Crown to a full yard and a half be too ſmall, for then if the Pond be any thing of a depth, the Fiſh will ſtrike away before the Net comes to ground; the whole Net ought to have a very large Meaſh, well Leaded, and deep Tucked.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing required, is to make the place clean from Stakes and Buſhes, and try with your Net before you intend for the Sport: If your Net hang, then all your labour is ſpent in vain; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore clean it very well with a Rake before you caſt your Net, once or twice, that there may be no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: Then proceed as to the baiting of them, for you muſt not imagine that Carps or Tench will come to that place more than another, except you do uſe to feed them; which order thus: Take a quarter of a peck of Wheat, baking it well in an Oven, putting in two quarts of Water at leaſt; when it is well baked, take two or three quarts of Blood, and mix this Wheat and Blood together, then put in as much Bran as will make it into a Paiſt; then to make it hold together, put ſome Clay to it, and ſo mold it well together with a quart of your Lob-Worms chopped in pieces and worked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Paſt; then roll it in pretty handſom Balls, and throw it into the Pond within the compaſs of your Caſting-Net; but between whiles throw in ſome Grains; and when you think the Fiſh hath found out the baiting-place, when you intend to fiſh, bait it with theſe Ingredients made up into a Paſt that I have directed; bait them in the morning betimes, then come in the dusk of the evening, and caſt your Net over the place where you baited; then take a long Pole with a large Fork made for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103298:10"/>
and the Net ſtill lying, ſtir all about the Net, for the Carps and Tench are ſtruck up to the Ears in Mud, and ſtand exactly upon their Heads; let the Net lie a quarter of an hour at leaſt, ſtill ſtirring with your Pole, if the place be not too deep; when you have covered the Fiſh, you may go into the Pond and take them all out with your hands, which I have ſeveral times ſeen done; but if it be, when you find the Carps begin to ſtir, (for they cannot lie long in the Mud) then lift up the Crown of your Net bolt up-right with a long Staff, that ſo the Fiſh may play into the tuck of the Net. If you ſhould draw up your Net preſently after you had caſt it in, it were a hundred to one if you had a Carp; but letting the Net lie, the Mud will choak them in half an hours time; and likewiſe you muſt keep ſtirring them up with your long Staff, till you find them ſtruck into your Tuck, which you muſt keep lifted up after your ſtirring them. I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late a ſhort Story of what I ſee done; A Gentleman had ſpecial Carps in his Pond, but knew not which way to take one, but by chance with Hook and Line; I did deſire him we might eat two or three of his Carps; he anſwered, with all his heart if I could tell how to take them; I prepared ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients, and having baited a place convenient in the morning very betimes, and in the dusk of the evening we came with our Caſting-Net, and at the throw covered a very great parcel of Fiſh, as by the ſequel of the Story will appear, but not one ſeemed to ſtir or wag under the Net, being all ſtruck in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Mud; The Gentleman laughed, and ſaid he was like to have but a ſlender Supper of Fiſh, and that he was afraid he ſhould have been forced to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103298:11"/>
ſend out for Butter to make Sauce; I deſired him he would have patience, for the Fiſh were a-ſleep, but I did not queſtion but to awake them half an hour hence: ſo the Gentleman having ſmoaked a Pipe of Tobacco, a Carp began to play in the Net; I think, ſays he, they have been a-ſleep indeed, that could not underſtand there was a Net over them all this while; then I began to ſtir with my long Pole to awaken them, and before you could tell an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred they began to dance in the Net; then I lifted up the Crown for them to play into the Tuck; and when I thought they were all out of the Mud I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to draw, and at one draught drew up in the Net ſeventy odd Carps great and ſmall, to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration and great ſatisfaction of the owner and the reſt of the company, having in all their life-time not ſeen the like before. <hi>Probatum eſt.</hi>

               <p>A Hern being as great a devourer of Fiſh as any is, I will affirm ten times as much as the Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſhall deſtroy a Pond more in one week, than an Otter ſhall do in three months, for I have ſeen a Hern that hath been ſhot at a Pond to have ſeventeen Carps at once in his Belly, which he will digeſt in ſix or ſeven hours, and to fiſhing again: (I ſee a Carp taken out of a Herns Belly nine inches and a half long); for ſeveral Gentlemen that have kept them tame, have put Fiſh in a Tub, and tryed the Hern how many ſmall Roches and Dace he would eat in a day, and they have found him to eat above 50 a day one day with another.

Now the beſt way to take this grand Enemy to Fiſh, is thus; Having found out his haunt, get three or four ſmall Roches or Dace, and have a ſtrong Hook with a Wire to it; draw the Wire juſt within-ſide the Skin of the Fiſh, beginning without-ſide of the Guills running of it to the Tail, and then the Fiſh will lie five or ſix days alive, for if the Fiſh be dead, the Hern will not touch him; let not your Hook be too rank; then having a ſtrong Line with Silk and Wire, about two yards and a half long, (if you twiſt not Wire with your Silk, his ſharp Bill will bite it in two immediately) and tie a round Stone about a pound weight to the Line, and lay three or four Hooks, and in two or three nights you ſhall not fail to have him if he comes to your Pond; lay not your Hooks in the deep Water where the Hern can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not wade to them, for if you do, they may lie long enough before you ſee the effect of your pains: co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour your Line of a dark green, for a Hern is a very ſubtle Bird.

               <head>An excellent way to take all manner of ſmall Bird with Bird-Lime.</head>
               <p>IN Winter, and eſpecially in a Snow, all ſorts of ſmall Birds will begin to flock together, as Larks, Chafinches, Lennets, and Yellow-hammers; which
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103298:12"/>
when you ſee about the Houſe or Field adjacent, having your Bird-lime provided of the beſt ſort, and not too old; order it thus, Take an Earthen Diſh and put your Bird-lime with ſome Capon's-greaſe or freſh Lard; put to a quarter of a pound of Bird-lime, half an ounce of Capon's-greaſe or Lard; then ſet it over the fire, and let it melt gently together; for if it boil you take away the ſtrength of the Bird-lime. Having thus ordered it, and made it fit for uſe, Then go into the Barn, and chuſe out an hundred of large Wheat-ears, and cut the Straw about a foot long beſides the Ears; then from the bottom of the Ears to the middle of the Straw, lime it about ſix or ſeven inches; let your Lime he warm when you lime the Straw, that ſo it may run thin upon the Straw, and leſs diſcernable to the Birds: When you have ſo done, go into your Field hard by your Houſe, and carry a little Bag of Chaff and threſhed Ears, and ſcatter theſe fourteen or fifteen yards wide, (it is beſt in a Snow); Then take Ears that are limed, and ſtick them up and down in the Snow, with the Ears leaning, or at the end touching the ground; then retire from the place, and drive them from any other haunt, and you will preſently ſee great flocks of Birds come to the place, and begin to peck the Ears of Corn, and fly away with them; which as ſoon as he mounts, the Straw that is Bird-limb'd laps under his Wing, and down he falls, not perceiving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be hanged; for I have ſeen many eat their Ears when they have been faſt limed under the Wing; therefore you muſt not go when three or four or more are taken, but let them alone till a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen or two are hampered; here in the Field you
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103298:12"/>
take moſt upon Larks; I have taken ſix dozen in a morning. You may lay ſome near home to take all manner of Finches, and eſpecially Sparrows (which is the Farmers Enemy of all ſmall Birds) for they will not come into the Field ſo far from the Houſe; let me tell you, Every dozen of Sparrows you take in Winter, ſhall ſave you a quarter of Wheat before Harveſt: therefore ſtick your Ears about the Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tops, and though you never have the Birds, yet the deſtruction of them will be a great advantage. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had this morning-Recreation, go and bait the place with a Bag or two of more Ears and Chaff, and let them reſt till next morning; then take ſome freſh Wheat-Ears again, and ſtick them as you did before. When you bait in the afternoon, take away all your limed Ears, that ſo the Birds may feed boldly and not be frighted againſt next morning.</p>

If you do not believe what I write, try one or two and you ſhall eaſily perceive a very great difference in a months time; the greateſt thing that I know which hinders the thriving of Hogs, is to let them lie too long in Straw, for if they have but a dry houſe, and a dry place to lie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; never trouble your ſelf for Straw, for it makes them Louſie and full of a dry Scurf which hinders their growth.</p>

               <head>How to make Cabbage-Plants grow great Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bages in very Barren Ground.</head>
               <p>THere be ſeveral poor People in this Kingdom which are ready to be ſtarved, which live near Heaths, (were it not for the convenience of Firing, which they have at a cheap rate) by reaſon the ground is ſo barren, that they know not which way to make any thing grow or thrive; for having plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the beſt ſort of your Cabbage-Plants, they turn all into pittiful Coleworts, and ſo reap little benefit or none at all, though they lay a load of Dung up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every Pole, the Ground is ſo dryed and ſo bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren. Now I ſhall direct you how with half a load of Dung allowed to every Pole, to have as large and big Cabbages, as if you laid ſix load upon a Pole; Having got two or three hundred of good ſhort-knotted, and well-ſtocked Plants, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they will turn to Coleworts in the beſt of Grounds; then conſider how many Plants a Pole of Ground will take up to ſet them at a convenient diſtance; then ſet them out, and dig as many holes about half a yard wide as you intend to ſet Plants; then fill up the Holes with Dung, and put ſome Earth into every Hole, and mix it well together with the Dung, let three quarters of it be Dung, then plant the Cabbage in the midſt of the Hole, (let there be half a foot of Dung and Mold below the Root of the Plant) and then water it very well three or four times in a week, if need require, that ſo the Plant may take good root; upon any dry time, you muſt give him water, that ſo the Cabbage may not be at a ſtand; and when you ſee him begin to turn in his Leaves, for leafing, heave
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:103298:15"/>
up the Earth to the Cabbage; ſet them not too thick, that ſo they may have room to ſpread; thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in a Pole will be ſufficient, for the richeſt Ground, if the ſtand too cloſe, produce little thing elſe but Coleworts: In ſetting of theſe thirty Plants half a load of good Dung will do it to every Pole; ſo every year the Ground will be inriched with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no charge conſidering the Crop it will bear; I have my ſelf, Dung being ſcarce, (as always it is in barren places) with two load planted four Pole of ground, which was very barren, being upon a gravelly Heath, and ſeveral of my Neighbours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by in the interim, laughed to ſee me plant Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage-Plants in ſo barren gravelly Soil; for they not ſeeing the Dung put into the Holes, never imagined that I had ſet my Cabbage-plants in almoſt all Dung and fine Mold; but when they came towards Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſee the fruits of my Labour, they ſtood like Men amazed, and would not believe their own eyes, but thought the Plants enchanted, (there was eighty odd leafed Cabbages, and very many weighed above 20 pound a Cabbage); which to ſatisfie their curioſity, and being willing to further them what I could, I pulled up one and ſhewed them exactly which way it was performed; and ſince hundreds have learnt it, to their great improvement of their little ground.</p>
               <p>Many of your poor People by all theſe Heath-ſides keep a Cow, which makes them two or three load of Dung in a year; which being laid upon five or ſix Pole of Ground, and ſpread abroad, and ſpiked in, only refreſhes the Ground and that is all, for the barren Ground being only ſprinkled, eats out the heart of the Dung and produceth no crop;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:103298:16"/>
but this way in time will make the Ground good with no charge, conſidering the profits as you will find by experience to ariſe.</p>

When you go to turn the Water into the Orchard, you muſt make a Dam croſs the High-way, otherwiſe your Trees may be parched for want of Water: If your Orchard lies drooping upon the ſide of a Hill, and the next adjoining Ground higher, though no High-way lie near it, yet taking your opportunity, may do thus; View round your Orchard, and conſider which end lies moſt conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to carry your Water throughout your whole Orchard, for you muſt begin with the higheſt part firſt; when you have thus taken the level of your Orchard, ſee where the greateſt Current of Water may fall, and from that place begin your main Trench, and let it go through your Orchard; and from this large Drain cauſe another leſs to water the firſt row of Trees, and ſo to the ſecond; if you find your Water prove ſcanty, and you cannot wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all your Orchard at once, order it for twice, thus; Make a ſide Trench that may carry the Water to the third or fourth row, and never ſpend any upon the firſt row at all; Now if you have no High-way, nor convenient Lane nor Ditch that carries any courſe of Water, that may prove any way beneficial to the watering of your Orchard; yet if your Orchard lean any way, with Trenches made to the Trees upon any ſudden ſhower, a great deal of Water may be conveyed to them, that falls in the Ground where they ſtand; ſo let any Orchard ſtand almoſt how it will, with skill, care, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and ſmall charge, you will be able to cauſe your Orchard to return treble profit for the firſt

               <p>I ſhall now faithfully relate what was the event of this kind of watering. There was a Farmer that took a ſmall Farm in <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> about twenty pound a year, not far from <hi>Reading,</hi> he took a Leaſe of five years, and lived two years in it, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved no benefit worth mentioning of his Orchard; I riding that way, with a Friend which was his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, he called in to ſee the Farmer; and having a little refreſhed our ſelves, we walked out in ſee his Ground, which was very poor; and at laſt going into his Orchard, the poor Farmer fetched a great ſigh: O, ſays he, would all theſe Trees were chopped up by the Roots, for this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard is ſpecial good Ground, but I have no benefit of it; for if I ſow it, the ſhade of the Trees and Birds devour all my Corn, and I have not had twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Buſhels of Apples this two years off from it, and I took it for the benefit of the Orchard, which was between three and four Acres of Ground: Country-Man (ſays I) you know not what Riches you have near you, for I will direct you a way to make this Orchard pay all your Rent, give me but a Hogſhead of Sider; But (ſays he) my Orchard muſt firſt find Apples: I perſwaded him to take a Leaſe of one and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> years, for I told him he had the beſt penny-worth in <hi>Oxford-ſhire;</hi> but his anſwer was, I wiſh I was well rid of this: Well, if it be ſo, obſerve my
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:103298:20"/>
Directions, and you need not fear but your Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard will pay your Rent; ſo having viewed his Orchard round, within a little ſpace diſtant from his Orchard went the High-way; I told him the convenience of this High-way would pay his Rent; How can that be when I ſell neither Beer nor Ale? I deſired him immediately to get me two or three Labourers and I would direct them; I brought the Water from the High-way, by making of a Dam through the middle of the ſmall Ground into the Orchard; then from that Trench I cauſed them to cut out ſeveral other Trenches, leading to every row of Trees, and made them dig a yard round every Tree that the Water may have time to ſoak into the Ground, having good compaſs round the Tree: Notwithſtanding all this, he had not ſo much Faith to take a new Leaſe, but firſt deſired to ſee the event of this new Invention: This was about the middle of <hi>February;</hi> I directed him alſo to ſmoother his Orchard with Muck and Fern, (which way to order is treated of in another place) and continue it ſo long as the Wind ſhould hold any way Eaſterly or Northerly. At the latter end of <hi>September,</hi> Buſineſs calling me that way, I called upon the Farmer to know how his Orchard thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; with a merry countenance he replyed, I have Apples enough to pay my Rent, and punctually performed his promiſe with an over-plus; I adviſed him now to take a new Leaſe, which then was too late, for his Landlord had been there and ſeen the Improvement, and would not let him a new Leaſe under 30 <hi>l. per Annum;</hi> for he was of an opinion, this way would not fail in cauſing the Orchard to bear; the Leaſe being expired, the Landlord keeps

the Orchard, and lets the Ground for 15 <hi>l. per Annum.</hi> The Orchard is duly worth to him twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pound a year more; that year when the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement was made he had about ſixty quarters of Apples; he fatted his Hogs with the worſt, and ſold the beſt at a good rate; All his charges amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but to 18 <hi>s.</hi> and 9 <hi>d.</hi>

will make a Bed 7 or 8 foot long, 3 foot high, and 3 foot over; tread it not extraordinary hard, let it as near as you can be all over of an equal hardneſs, for elſe one Seed will be up before another; having raiſed your Bed to the higheſt, get a load of pure Horſe-Dung, without Straw, and lay it at the top, and wet the Horſe-Dung, and beat it very ſmooth with your Spade; then ſift ſome pure Mold, being laſt years Dung rotted; for if it have any Earth in it, the Melons will not thrive kindly, but moſt part will be ſubject to pine away; therefore get the richeſt Mold you can have, ſifted on, about four in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches or five thick; your Melons and Cucumber-Seed being ſteeped in Milk twenty four hours, put them in at two or three inches diſtance with your finger, and about an inch and a half deep; then having ſome Melon-Glaſſes ready, cover them, to draw up the heat to the top of the Herbs; Glaſſes are the beſt of things to bring up early Melons, for they keep out Wind and Weather, and let in the Sun to comfort them. But as ſome have directed to place Forks, and lay Sticks upon the Forks, then cover them with Straw, it avails little; for a good ſhower of Rain, or a ſmall Froſt, puts an end to your trouble: your Mat-covering is far better, and cover the Mat over with Straw; no early Melons are to be brought up without Glaſſes; thoſe that cannot go to the charge of all Glaſs, make them thus, Make three parts of them Wood, and one part Glaſs, and let the glaſſy-ſide always ſtand to the Sun; when you open them, when you perceive them to peep above-ground, cover them again a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a quarter of an inch with warm Mold from the bottom of the Bed; and when they are ſhot
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:103298:23"/>
above-ground, cover up the Stakes cloſe to the Leaves, and when the Sun appears, give them ſome about ten of the Clock till eleven, and cover your Glaſs over with ſome Straw that the Sun prove not too hot; open that again about two till four; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſtill as the Plants riſe, to raiſe up the Earth to the Leaves: When you find the Bed begin to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, immediately remove your Plants into another Bed, otherwiſe your labour and former pains will be loſt, for you ſhall find the Roots in a ſhort time to periſh and decay for want of heat; which when they come into a freſh Bed, they will mount away and grow more in one day than in ſix before in the other Bed: If you find the Bed to grow dry, ſteep ſome Water in Sheeps-Dung, and having made it Blood-warm, water them once in twelve hours or more, according as you ſhall find occaſion: Now having taken out all your beſt Plants, and planted them about four inches diſtance in your new Bed, then ſtir all your Mold of your old Bed, and if it be too dry wet it, and then rake the Earth very even, and ſow your Colli-flower Seeds in rows, not too thick; if you ſhould ſow them with the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons and Cucumbers, they would run up ſuch a height with the heat of the Bed, that they would never flower worth a farthing, but being ſowed when the Bed is almoſt cold, they will come up green and be brave ſtocky Plants; when they have three Leaves or more, plant them out into the other Melon, (which will be then time to remove the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon-Plants to ſtand all the year) and plant the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-flowers up to the Leaves, and water them with Water wherein Sheep or Pigeon-Dung hath been ſoaked, and you ſhall find them thrive abundantly.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:103298:23"/>
Thus much for the Colly-flower. Now to Plant the Melons where they ſhall ſtand all the year; dig a large Trench about four foot deep, and three foot over, and place therein ſome Dung that will heat; about three foot deep let the Dung be, then make a ſquare hole about a foot deep, and half a yard ſquare, and put ſome very rich Mold in about half full; then taking up your Melons very carefully, ſet three Melons to a Hole, (or two and a Cucumber) and place them triangular, and ſet deep with ſome of their warm Mold, that the tops of the Leaves may be level with the top of the Bed; then ſet your Glaſſes upon them and cover them very warm, and water them with Dung-water for two or three days after you have ſet them, let the Water be Blood-warm; if it ſhould prove a backward Spring, you muſt keep them very warm, and not leave them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered till all the Froſts be gone; you muſt ſerve your forward Cucumbers after the ſame manner: But for your latter Cucumbers order them thus; About the latter end of <hi>March</hi> or beginning of <hi>April,</hi> dig a Trench as you did for the Melons, and fill it with new Horſe-Dung; your Trench may be from 3 yards to 20, fill it up with new Horſe-Dung, and make ſquare holes as when you planted the Melons, and fill the Holes with rich Mold, and ſet the Seed two inches deep into the Mold; you may ſet a dozen Seeds into a Hole, and cut the worſt away; when they come up, cover them with Straw or Cabbage-leaves to ſhelter them from Wind and Weather till they have got four or five leaves, and then you may truſt them, and not fail of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbers in abundance. Plant your Pompion upon a Dunghil if you can, if not, dig a large Trench
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:103298:24"/>
and fill it with Dung that may a little heat, and make ſquare Holes, and plant three in a Hole (tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angular) in Mold, and when you perceive them above-ground, water them very well with Dung-water, and they will thrive exceeding well; when you ſee a Pompion kernel'd and grown to the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Gooſe Egg, and the Runner ſhoot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and produce another a yard beyond him, lay the Runner half a foot or more in the Ground, and it will ſhoot out Roots and nouriſh the other Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, for that next the Root intercepts all the Sap from the other, and in two or three days will pine to nothing; obſerving this direction, you may have nine or ten upon a Root, otherwiſe very ſeldom above three, I have ſeen nine very large ones upon a Root. Now your Colly-flowers having ſix or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Leaves are ready to be planted, and order them thus; Dig as many Holes about a foot ſquare and deep, and a yard apart, and make a Hole between every four, then put a ſhovelful or two of good rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Dung into every Hole, and mix it well together; then taking up your Plants very carefully with the Mold, ſet them in ſo deep that the tops of the Leaves may not be ſo high as the Ground, and water them very well, then lay a Cabbage-leaf over every hole to keep the hot Sun and cold Air from them; if it be a very dry time, water them often, or elſe you will be deceived in the flowering of them.</p>

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:103298:26"/>
Firſt, When you have made your Garden, then conſider how many ſorts of Earth, and the ſeveral ſhady places for Herbs that love it, for you muſt conſider the nature of the Herb what it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in. I ſhall give ſix or ſeven Examples which I hope will be ſufficient for all; as firſt, For your Adder-tongue it grows in moiſt low Grounds and Meadows; if this Herb be planted in a hot Ground, it may flouriſh a little for the firſt year, but you may look for it in the Meadows the next, therefore plant him in ſome moiſt place of the Garden: An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica is an Herb hot and dry, if you plant it in a cold moiſt Ground, it pines away and comes not to any thing, therefore the richeſt Ground is beſt: Liver-wort is a Herb that delights to grow in moiſt ſhady places, as by the heads of Springs and Ponds; and inſides of Wells, and is green all the year; this Herb muſt be planted by ſome moiſt Wall or ſhady Bank, where it ſees very little of the Sun, for any heat or dryth kills it: Roſemary is a hot and dry Herb, delights to grow in the Sun, and near a Wall, if that be planted in a cold ſpringy place, it pines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to nothing; if your Ground be very cold, and Roſemary ſubject to die, mingle half your Mold with Lime and it will thrive and proſper extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary: Obſerve one thing, There is no Herb that grows, if it doth not delight in the Sun; that is good for the Heart. Harts-tongue delights by High-way ſides in Banks of Ditches, and not in the bottoms; plant him upon the Bank of ſome Ditch. Penny-royal delights in a hot and moiſt place; plant it where it may only have the morning Sun, keep it low, and ſuffer it not to grow into long Branches, for then it uſually dies in the end: Take notice al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:103298:26"/>
That what Herbs you plant, order the place where you ſet it, to be of the nature of your Plant; that is, thus; If your Herb be hot and dry, a hot and dry place in your Garden; if cold and dry, a cold and dry place; ſo hot and moiſt, and cold and moiſt; you may know the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of any Herb almoſt by the place where you find him naturally to grow; for it's contrary to Senſe and Reaſon, that cold and moiſt Herbs ſhould thrive in hot and dry places.</p>

               <p>THey that intend to dry Herbs to have them good, muſt obſerve their Times and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: Gather your Herbs where they naturally grow, as your Betony it delights in Woods; ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther him when it begins to bud out for flowering; tie them up in ſmall Bunches, and hang it croſs the Lines in the Wind and Sun; the quicker you dry any Herbs, the far better it is; gather always in a dry day, and let it not hang where it can rain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, for that will make it look black, and alſo take away the ſcent; when you have dryed them, put them in Brown-Paper-Bags, and before Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, lay them two or three hours in the Sun, and that will very much refreſh them; hang them in a warm dry place but not too hot, for then the heat will draw out the Spirits of them.</p>
               <p>Here is but three things to be obſerved to have extraordinary good dryed Herbs; Gather them in

               <head>Of the Nightingale.</head>
               <p>NOW every Man hath almoſt a ſeveral phanſie, ſome make choice of one Bird, ſome of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but in my choice and opinion, the Nightingal hath the ſuperiority above all others, and almoſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the judgment and conſent of every one, ſhe ſingeth with ſo much variety the ſweeteſt and melodieſt of all others. I need not much deſcribe the Bird, by reaſon ſhe is ſufficiently known to moſt People, by reaſon of her plentifulneſs and tameneſs, and far more kept in <hi>Italy</hi> than in any other parts of the World, though in moſt Countries I have been they keep them little or much. They appear to us at the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> (none as yet know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where their Habitation is during all the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter); I have made ſeveral tryals in the beginning, middle, and latter end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> of ſeveral Nightin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals that I have taken, being ſo extream fat, that they being turned looſe, could not fly forty yards, and when down, was not able to riſe again, which makes moſt believe that they take up their dwelling here all the Winter, and think them to ſleep; for I have had ſeveral, when fat, to be three weeks and not eat one bit of meat, which in ſome ſhort time begins to make her Neſt; uſually ſhe makes it about a foot and a half or two foot above Ground, either in thick Quick-ſet Hedges, or in Beds of Nettles, where old Quick-ſet hath been thrown together, and Nettles grown through, and makes it of ſuch materials as the place affords; ſhe hath commonly young ones at the beginning of the Month of <hi>May,</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:103298:29"/>
when all the Earth is beſet and ſpangled with the curious varieties of all odoriferous Flowers, and pleaſant greenneſs; and in Groves and thick Buſhes formed in the likeneſs of a Wilderneſs, upon which the Sun in the morning doth caſt his cool and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Beams, from noon till the ſetting thereof ſhe naturally delights to haunt cool places, where ſmall Rivolets, Fountains, and Brooks are accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated, with Groves, Shades, thick Quick-ſet Hedges, and other well-ſhadowed places not far diſtant. I told afore how I found their Neſts made, but ſome have affirmed to me, That they have found them upon the Ground, at the bottom of Hedges, and amongſt waſt Grounds; and ſome of them that have found them upon Banks that have been raiſed, and then overgrown with thick Graſs, in which they have built their Neſts; I never found any built in ſuch places, yet I cannot ſay but other Countries may make the Birds to differ in their Building, though not in their Songs. As for the number of their Eggs it's uncertain, ſome three or four, and ſome five, according to the ſtrength of their Bodies. Now the Nightingale which I would adviſe you to keep, let him be of the earlieſt Birds that is brod in the Spring, for the earlier the better, by reaſon ſhe will become more perfect in her Songs, for the old one hath more time to ſing over, or continues longer in ſinging than thoſe that are bred later, and you may have better hope and aſſurance of long living, and being brought up and kept with more eaſe and ſafety; for having the Summer before them, they throw off and mue, and caſt their Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers much ſooner and quicker than later in the year; for if ſhe caſt her Feathers at the end of the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:103298:29"/>
year, ſhe is ſubject to be over run with certain Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min which hinders the growth of Feathers, which the cold coming, and finding her bare of Feathers cauſeth her to die; which happeneth to ſeveral that <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> latter Birds at the end of Summer, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly prove moſt to be Hens, and if Cocks, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom worth keeping. The young Nightingals muſt be taken out of their Neſts when they are indifferent well feathered, and not too little nor too much; if too much, they will be ſullen; and if too little, if you keep them not very warm they will die with cold; and then alſo they will be much longer a bringing up. Their Meat may be made of Lean Beef, Sheeps-Heart, or Bullocks-Heart; you ſhall firſt pull off the fat Skin that covereth the Heart, and take out the Sinews as clean as you can, then <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:103298:30"/>
the Neſt, put always ſome of their Meat by them, with a few Ants in it, to teach them to feed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. You muſt keep them a little hungryer than ordinary when you cage them, and then they will ſooner take to their Meat to feed alone; and when he doth feed, be ſure to give four or five times a day, a Gobbet or two at a time, for they will not feed enough at firſt to ſatisfie themſelves; you muſt make freſh Meat every day in the Summer, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if it ſtand longer, it will be very ſubject to ſtink and turn ſower; when they begin to Moult, or caſt their Feathers, give them half an Egg, and the other half Sheeps-Heart, with a little Saffron mixed in the Water, for you muſt make it not too ſtiff nor too limber, let the Egg be boiled very hard, and not too ſtale; Give them no Duck-Eggs, for I had 6 Nightingales killed one Night with a Duck-Egg: For want of this Meat (uſing them to it) you may give them ſome Wood-Larks Meat, which will be ſhewed the way of making when I come to treat of that Bird: You may uſe your Nightingal to ſeveral ſorts of Meats, ſo that for three or four days, if you can get no Fleſh you may keep them alive. I ſhall ſhew you hereafter to make a Paſte which ſhall ſerve upon all occaſions, if you can get no Fleſh, I have fed them two or three days with your Red-Worms and Caterpillars and Hog-lice, and a few Meal-Worms; to give them now and then a Meal-Worm makes them familiar, ſo you let them take it out of your hands, but too many ſpoils them, without they are very poor and droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

               <p>NOw I have ſhewed where they Build, and how to Feed and Order them, I ſhall ſhew you the way of taking Young and Old. For taking of Young Birds, obſerve where the Cock ſings, and if you find him to ſing long in a place, then the Hen ſits not far off; but if he hath young ones, he will ever now and then be miſſing, and then the Hen when you come near her Neſt will ſweet and cur; and if you have ſearched long and cannot find them, ſtick a Meal-Worm or two upon a Thorn, and obſerve which way he carried it, and ſtand ſtill, or lie down, and you will hear them when ſhe feeds them, (they make a great noiſe for ſo ſmall a Bird); when you have found the Neſt, if they be not fledged enough, touch them not, for if you do, they will never tarry in the Neſt, and then it will be loſt labour, to be deprived of it when you have found it: Now for to take your Branches, which is young ones that have been bred up by the old ones in the Field, You muſt go to ſuch places that are moſt likely for Food, for the Old ones when they have puſhed the Young ones out of the Neſt, (which we call Puſhers) leads them from the place they were bred in, to a place more plentiful of Food, for they commonly deſtroy all the Food that is near in bringing them up, ſo are forced to ſeek out further to preſerve their young ones: When you have found where they be, which you ſhall know by their curring and ſweeting; for if you call true, they will anſwer you immediately; then

               <p>THe Opinions and ſeveral Judgments of Men concerning Nightingals, (that is) namely, to have any perfect rule to know one Sex from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are very ſundry and divers, you muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand thoſe are for old Birds taken in the Spring; I ſhall give you ſeveral Mens Opinions, and then my own at laſt, (for it is a very great vexation to keep your Hens four or five months inſtead of Cocks, and not only the trouble and charge, but to be fruſtrated in our expectation, at laſt expecting a great deal of pleaſure, it proves a vexation). Firſt, Some do undertake to diſtinguiſh the Cock from the Hen, by their groſſneſs, ſaying, That the Cock is much the larger and fuller Bird, both in length and big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Others are of Opinion, That the Cock hath a greater Eye, a longer Beak, and a reddiſher Tail: Others again diſtinguiſh by the Pinnion of the Wing, and the Feathers upon the Head: All which Opinions and Judgments I have found very deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and far wide of the true and perfect knowledg of the Truth, for I have had perfect brave Cocks, Song-Nightingals, and that a great number of them, that have been very ſmall and little, having all the marks aſcribed to them to be Hens, and Hens with ſeveral Marks that have been aſſigned to the Cocks:
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:103298:34"/>
Wherefore for a more ſure and certain ſign, you ſhall be put out of doubt, and truſt to theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Obſervations: Firſt, As concerning your Neſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings that are taken out from the Old ones in the Neſt before they can feed; obſerve this Rule, and mark it well, That if any of the young Birds or Neſtlings (before they can feed themſelves) do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord ſomething of Song to themſelves; and if you mark them well, you ſhall perceive their Throats to wag when they record: Mark, thoſe Birds for your uſe, for it's a certain ſign, as I have experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented it, that they are all Cocks; but when they come to feed themſelves, the Hen will Record as well as the Cock; therefore give him ſome mark when they are young, for it is very difficult to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh afterward. In the next place, is your Brancher, which the old Bird hath brought up to feed himſelf before you take him; when you have taken this Bird, and he feeds himſelf, he will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently begin to Record, both Cocks and Hens; but the Cock is much differing from the Hen, for the Cock continues his recording much longer than the Hen, and louder, and much oftner in the day-time; and alſo you ſhall perceive the Cock to ſweet and our much oftner than the Hen, and alſo with more Spirit and much louder, and uſually you will find him ſtanding upon one Leg, and holding on his warbling notes, which you ſhall perceive by the motion of his Breſt, with a long continuance, which is not to be found in the Hen, for ſhe goeth hopping and whiſtling up and down the Cage, making a Noiſe more like than a Song, that is very much interrupted and ſhort.</p>

               <p>WHen you ſhall find that the Nitingal that eats well by himſelf, and that ſings often, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeeming to be diſturbed at every little noiſe, you ſhall by little and little put back the Green-Bayes wherewith the fore-ſide of the Cage is covered (for thoſe Cages are moſt convenient for Nightingals, that have the Wire only afore, and all the other parts made up; though I have many times kept them in Wood-Lark Cages, but I do not find them ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, by reaſon of the warmth; and then the Nightingal being a buckiſh Bird, is apt to ſtrike his Head againſt the top-Wires, which very often proves his death, for no Nitingal is fit to be put in one of thoſe open Cages, but thoſe that are very tame and familiar; and moſt People are deficient in lining the other Nightingal-Cages at top, which is very neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for many Birds have beat out their brains (againſt the top-Board for want of lining) every day a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in ſuch fort that the Bird may not perceive it; and as you uncover him, ſet him by little and little more in the ſight of People, that ſo he may grow bolder, and not be frightned with the light and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of People, nor with any ſudden noiſe; the beſt way is to hang him towards the top of the Cieling upon a Nail, for they do not delight to hang low; for if he be full in Song, and you hang him upon a ſudden amongſt much Company, and open, or put back the Green-Bays, and give him too much light all at once, he will immediately break off ſinging, and ten to one if he ſings till

I will not deny, notwithſtanding what I have ſaid, but ſome that have been curious obſervers of Marks, may if they take them together; but this is that I affirm, That ſeveral have been mightily deceived by thoſe Marks before mentioned; but by the ſinging, the Nightingals taken in <hi>Auguſt</hi> are moſt certainly and evidently apparent to be diſcerned. And as for thoſe which are taken in <hi>April,</hi> your knowledg reſteth in theſe ſeveral Obſervations; Firſt, When you have taken the Bird that you think you heard ſing, call again, and if the Cock anſwers and ſings again, then you have taken the Hen and not the Cock; but if you find the Cock not to ſing, then be aſſured you have the Male; for if you take the Hen at firſt, and he miſſing of his Hen will ſing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily, alſo in lower parts of the Sex which the Cocks put forth, which the Hens do not; but if you take a Bird about the middle of <hi>May,</hi> or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>June,</hi> you may perceive the Hen very apparently from the Cock, by reaſon all the Breaſt of the Hen will be bare with Sitting, and all full of

               <head>The ſeveral ſorts of Diſeaſes the Nightingal is ſubject to, and how to relieve them.</head>
               <p>THe Nightingal, as I have before obſerved, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the latter end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> grows extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary fat, both abroad in the Fields, and alſo in Houſes where they are caged up, which moſt do look upon to be very dangerous when it begins to abate if they do not ſing; but to help this, They muſt be kept very warm upon the falling of their fat, and alſo given ſome Saffron in their Meat or Water; but when they are perceived to grow fat, they muſt be purged two or three times a-week with ſome Worms that are taken out of a Pigeon-Houſe, for the ſpace of four or five weeks toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and alſo you ſhall find very frequent about the beginning of <hi>Auguſt</hi> about your Vines, or Currans, or Gooſe-berry Buſhes, a ſort of ſpeckled Spider (which is to be found at no time of the year elſe) they are very plentiful; ſo you may give them two or three in a day as long as they laſt, for this will purge and cleanſe them extraordinary: if they grow melancholy, put into their Water or Drinking-Pot ſome White Sugar-Candy, with a ſlice or two of Liquoriſh; and if this doth not help them, but they ſtill complain, put into their Water-Pot ſix or eight chives of Saffron, or there-about, continuing withal to give them the Paſte and Sheeps-Heart ſhred very fine, and alſo give them three or four Meal-Worms a day, and a few Ants and their Eggs; and alſo boil a new laid Egg very hard, and chop it ſmall and ſtrew it amongſt the Ants and their Eggs, for I have had them, when very fat, to faſt ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:103298:37"/>
or eighteen days together, but it is far better when they eat. Nightingals that have been kept two or three years in a Cage, are very ſubject to the Gout; now when you ſhall perceive it, take them out of their Cage and anoint their Feet with freſh Butter or Capons-Greaſe; do ſo three or four days together, and it is a certain Cure for them. I had almoſt forgot the principal thing that cauſes the moſt of Diſeaſes in your Nightingal; which is this, That for want of keeping them clean and neat they clog their feet, which cauſes ſeveral to have their Claws to rot off, and it brings the Cramp and Gout, and makes them never thrive nor delight in themſelves; therfore be ſure to let them have twice a week Gravel at the bottom of the Cage, and let it be very dry when you put it in, for then it will not be ſubject to clog, for I look upon a Bird as good as dead, when they are continually clogged; for if they be in heart, they will pick and clean their Feet, and prune their Feathers; no Bird can be kept too clean nor too neat, for that cauſes them to take delight in themſelves. The next thing the Nightingal is ſubject to, Is Apoſtems, and breaking out about their Eyes and Neb, for which you ſhall likewiſe uſe your freſh Butter or Capons-Greaſe. I ſhall now ſhew you a great ſecret to raiſe Nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingals that are very bare, When you ſee an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity for it, give them new Figs chopped very ſmall amongſt their Sheeps-Heart and Paſte, or hard Eggs, and when they are recovered, bring them again to their ordinary Diet, that may conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to maintain them in their former plight, for as ſoon as ever you perceive they are growing fat, give them no more Figs. There alſo happeneth unto the

Nightingal another Diſeaſe, called the Straitneſs or ſtrangling of the Breaſt, which comes very often for want of care in making of their Meat, by min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing fat Meat therewith; and you may perceive it by the beating pain not afore accuſtomed, which he abideth in this place; and alſo by this, when he is given very often to gape, and opening his Bill. This Diſeaſe alſo happeneth, by reaſon of ſome Sinew or Thread of the Sheeps-Heart (for want of well ſhreding with a ſharp Knife) to hang in his Throat, or many times it will claſp about his Tongue, which cauſeth him to forſake his Meat, and grow very poor in a ſhort time, eſpecially if it be in the Spring-time, or when he is in Song: Now as ſoon as you ſhall perceive him to gape, or ſhaking open his Bill, take him gently out of his Cage, and open his Bill with a Quill or Pin, and unlooſen any ſtring or looſe piece of Fleſh that may hang about his Tongue or Throat; I have ſeen very many that have been killed with ſome of the Sinew or looſe Fleſh hanging about the Tongue and Throat; after you have taken it away, give him ſome white Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar-Candy in his Water, or elſe diſſolve it and moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten his Meat, which is a preſent Remedy to cure any thing that is amiſs; for in brief I muſt tell you, All Birds that eat Sheaps-Heart, or other Heart, if the Keeper and Maker be not careful to mince it very fine, are very ſubject to be troubled with the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe afore mentioned, and are ſeldom good after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>

               <p>THoſe Nightingals that inhabit by High-Ways and Orchards, and ſing cloſe by Houſes, and are us'd to the company of People, are far beyond thoſe that are bred in Copices and more remote places; for I have many times obſerved, That Birds taken where People have much frequented, will feed much ſooner, and ſing alſo, and come to be familiar in a ſhort time, when others that are taken farther off, are long before they come to feed, and for the moſt part are very ſubject to fright, and upon the leaſt diſlike will give off ſinging; for when you have taken any Bird, and find him ſtubborn and not take his Meat kindly, and beat himſelf againſt the Cage, ſet him flying again for he will never prove worth keeping. Be careful not to untie the Wing of your Nightingal till they are very tame and familiar, for if you do, when they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves free, they will fall immediately a-beating themſelves, ſo you muſt be forced to new-tie, or elſe your Bird will quickly beat himſelf to death, or if not, he will make himſelf uncapable of ſinging that year.</p>

               <head>Now concerning the Wood-Lark.</head>
               <p>THis Bird very many hold not much inferior in Song to the Nightingal; nay, a great many do prefer him before it; but it is of this Bird as of all other, ſome are far excellenter than others, both in length and ſweetneſs of Song; I have known
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:103298:39"/>
ſome Wood-Larks to have a great part of the Nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingal, for that being bred by Coppice-ſides, and other places where the Nightingals Haunts may be. Now this Bird is a very tender Bird, and yet he breeds the ſooneſt of any Bird we have in <hi>England,</hi> I had a Neſt of young Birds ready to fly by the <hi>16th</hi> of <hi>March.</hi> This Bird is a very hot mettleſome Creature, for if they be not taken in <hi>January,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>February,</hi> they grow ſo extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary rank, that in a ſhort time they pine away, by reaſon of the rankneſs of the Stones, which we find extraordinary ſwelled when dead. This Bird delights mightily upon gravelly Grounds and Hills that lie to the riſing of the Sun, and in Oat Stubbs: This Bird is coupled with his Mate at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>February,</hi> (and then they part with all their laſt years Brood) and immediately go to Neſt: they build moſt commonly in your Laiers Grounds, where the Graſs hath been pretty rank, and is grown Ruſſet; they build with ſome Bennet-Graſs, or ſome of the dead Graſs of the Field, and make it always under ſome large Tuffet to ſhelter them from the Wind and Weather, which commonly at that time of the year is very cold; they feed their Young with a ſmall kind of Worm; I have taken ſeveral of their Neſts, with a reſolution to bring them up, (we not underſtanding the way of taking them by Net in the Country, as they do here about <hi>London)</hi> but could never do it, (though I have brought up all ſorts of other Birds) for this reaſon, They either had the Cramp, or elſe turn'd into a Scouring, in leſs than a weeks time after I had taken them from the Old Ones; ſeveral that have been perhaps dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genter than I, have brought them up to feed, but I
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:103298:39"/>
could never hear of any that kept them ſo long till they ſung, and made them the leaſt part of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for their trouble and charge they had been it. This Bird hath a moſt curious melodious plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Song, carrying of it through with ſo much ſweetneſs and curioſity, and abundance of variety, that I have had very many that have had almoſt thirty ſeveral ſorts of Notes; which if they ſing laviſh, is a moſt raviſhing Melody, and eſpecially when the Nightingal and they ſing both together, each other ſtriving to outvie the other; for I have ſeen a hot-mettled Wood-Lark to ſtrain his Note ſo much, that he hath dropt down dead off from the Pearch, in ſtriving to exceed his Antagoniſt: Theſe Birds are, as I told you before, never bred from the Neſt, as I could ever underſtand. They are taken at three months of the year, in <hi>June, July,</hi> and <hi>Auguſt,</hi> which we term young Branchers, having not moulted their Neſtling-Feathers; I ſhall ſhew you here after that, how at this time of the year you may take them, with a Hauk called a Hobby. The next ſeaſon of taking, is the general flight-time, which is the latter end of <hi>September,</hi> for then they rove from one Country to another, and then the Branchers are all moulted off, and then you can hardly diſtinguiſh an Old Bird from a Young One; it this time of the year they take them in great quantities, compared with other times. The next Seaſon is the beginning of <hi>January,</hi> till the latter end of <hi>February,</hi> at which time they are all coupled and returned to their Laires or Breeding-places: The Birds that are taken in <hi>June, July,</hi> and at the beginning of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> are commonly taken with a Hobby adoring; which is this, Get out in a dewy
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:103298:40"/>
morning, and go to the ſide of ſome Hills, which lie to the riſing of the Sun, where they moſt uſually frequent; and having ſprung them, obſerve where they fall, then ſurround them two or three, times with your Hauk upon your Fiſt, making of him hover when you come indifferent near, and they will he till you clap a little Net upon them, that you carry upon the end of a Stick; or elſe if three or four of you go together, take a Net made after the manner of them uſed for Partridges, when you go with a Setting-Dog only, the Meaſh muſt be ſmaller; let it be a Lark-Meaſh, and then your Hauk to the Larkis like a Setting-Dog to Partridges, ſo with ſuch a Diet you may take all the whole Company at one draught: In like manner you may take your Sky-Larks, but they ſeldom are above two together; but your Wood-Larks keep compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with their young ones till flight-time, and then they part.</p>

I do hold the Birds taken in <hi>January</hi> and <hi>February</hi> for the moſt part do prove the beſt, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they are taken in full Stomach, and ſing in a very ſhort time after, and are more perfect in their song than thoſe taken at other Seaſons; and the only way to preſerve him and help him of theſe Diſtempers, is firſt to give him freſh Gravel twice or thrice a week, and-let it be ſifted fine, otherwiſe it will bruiſe his Feathers basking in the Sand if you leave gravelly Stones. Secondly, Be ſure to let him have ſuch Meat that is not too ſtale, for if it be mouldy and dry, the vertue is almoſt gone out; ſo he ſhall never thrive upon it. Thirdly, Have a <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

two or three days, a Turf of Three-leaved Graſs, as is uſed to the Sky-Lark, and boyl him a Sheeps-Heart, and mince it ſmall, and mingle it amongſt his Bread, and Egg, and Hemp-ſeeed, which will cauſe him to thrive extraordinarily. To kill his Lice, Take him out of the Cage (if it be not a very good Bird it is not worth while) and ſmoak his Feathers with ſome Tobacco, and give him freſh Gravel, and ſet him in a hot place where the Sun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhines, and he will immediately rid himſelf of the Vermin, if he hath ſtrength to busk in the Sand; for the Truth is, Theſe Diſeaſes almoſt happen through keeping of them naſty, and not giving of them good Diet: If you would have your Bird ſing very laviſh, feed him all his time of Song with ſome Sheeps-Heart mixed with his Egg, and Bread, and Hemp-Seed; and put in his Water two or three ſlices of Liquoriſh, and a little white Sugar-Candy, with two or three Blades of Saffron; do ſo once in a week, and it will cauſe him to be long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winded, and extraordinary laviſh in his Song, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying it out alſo at a far greater length than at other times; and I hold ſome Wood-Larks not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to the Nightingal; but the bad keeping, and ill-ordering makes them ſing ſo dully as if they were aſleep, which otherwiſe he is a very chearful Bird; for obſerve them when they ſing in the Fields, with what raviſhing melodious Songs they charm your ears, which if well-ordered, would prove the ſame being kept in a Cage.</p>

               <p>I Shall tell you a ſmall Story, I and another Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman riding in the Country in an evening hard by a Coppice or Wood-ſide, heard a Nightingal ſing ſo ſweetly, as to my thinking, I never heard the like in all my life, although I have heard a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in my time; for the place being in a Valley, and the Coppice on the ſide of it; made all the Notes of the Nightingal ſeem double with the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho; we had not ſtay'd long, but comes a Wood-Lark and lights upon a dead Twig of an Oak, and there they ſang, each out-vying the other; in a ſhort ſpace more, about an hundred paces off, lights another Wood-Lark, diſtant from the firſt, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, as near as we could judg, was another Nightingal; theſe four Birds ſang with ſo melodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Harmony, warbling out their pleaſant Notes for above a whole hour, that never any Muſick came in competition with it, to the pleaſing of our Ears; as ſoon as the Wood-larks were gone, the Nightingals, we ſuppoſed, went a little to refreſh Nature, having play'd their parts ſo well, that every Bird in the higheſt degree ſtrove for maſtery, each ſtriving to out-vie the other. My Friend and I having ſtood a full hour to hear theſe Songſters charming our Ears, at our going, I perſwaded him to ſing a merry Catch under the Wood-ſide; which he had no ſooner began, but one of the Nightingals came and bore his Part, and in a minutes time came me other to bear his Part, ſtill keeping of their ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and my Friend and I ſtanding between them, for it is obſerved by all that know the nature of the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:103298:42"/>
Nightingal, that he will ſuffer no Competitor, if he be able to maſter him, (if not, they will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times rather die than give place) and ſo he ſang three or four merry Songs, and the Birds ſinging with him all the time, and as he raiſed his Notes ſo did they, that he did proteſt, He never enjoyed more pleaſure in ſo ſhort a time in all his life, for the Coppice or Wood being upon the ſide of a Hill, and a Valley in the Bottom, ſo doubled all their Notes, with ſuch a ſweet and pleaſant Eccho, that I am confident none could think the time long in the hearing ſo ſweet and delightful pleaſant Harmony.</p>

               <p>IT is a Bird that is very common in all parts of <hi>England,</hi> ſo is not ſo much regarded and taken notice of; but I do eſteem ſome of them to be very fine pleaſant Song-Birds, for in all Birds of the ſame kind, there is as much difference as between skim'd Milk-Cheeſe and Cream, both being Cheeſe; ſo that in the Lark, both Skie-Lark, the one not worth 3 <hi>d.</hi> and the other worth 40 <hi>s.</hi> This Bird is a very hardy Bird, living almoſt upon any Food, if he hath but a green Turff of Three-Leav'd Graſs once in a week. This Bird is much later than the Wood-Lark by almoſt two months, for he ſeldom hath young Ones until the middle of <hi>May,</hi> when the Wood-Lark hath in <hi>March.</hi> This Bird, though in Winter we ſee great flocks, almoſt in every Country throughout <hi>England,</hi> yet we find the feweſt of their Neſts of any Birds I know that are ſo plentiful; they moſt commonly Build in

You muſt have fine red Gravel at the bottom of your Cage,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:103298:43"/>
and ſhift it every week at fartheſt, otherwiſe he will be ſubject to clog his Feet with his Dung, and will not take half that delight in himſelf, for he delights to bask himſelf in Sand; which I find, if he hath not pretty often he proves louſie, and then ſeldom or never comes to any thing, for they neither are handſome to the Eye, nor give any melody to the Ear, therefore be ſure to keep them clean and neat, and they will anſwer your expectation; you muſt line your Pearch in the Cage with ſome green Bays, or elſe make a Pearch of a Mat, which I have found them ſo very much delight in: If you find him very wild when he is taken, keep him three or four days from Company till he begins to eat his Meat; ſtrew ſome of the Hemp-Seed and Oat-Meal upon the Sand, and ſome of his mixed Meat alſo, for ſometimes they do not find the Pan till they be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt famiſhed, and then ſeldom are recovered to their former ſtrength.</p>

Now the trueſt way that ever I could find to be certain at all times, is firſt the largeneſs and length of his Call:

Secondly, The tall walking of the Bird about the Cage.

               <p>THis Bird is of a curious Song, and a tender Bird to be kept if not rightly ordered; but if well ordered, I have known him been kept ſix or ſeven years, with great pleaſure to the Keeper, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been better and better every year that he hath been kept, and at laſt hath ſung ſuch varieties of Notes, even to admiration of underſtanding Ears, that are able to judg between the goodneſs in Song in one Bird and another. Theſe Birds are very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Cramp, giddineſs in the Head, and to be very louſie. Many People admire how they can be cold in a Houſe, when others that are abroad ſuffer much more, and are never ſubject to the Cramp; the reaſon is this, That abroad they have
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:103298:44"/>
variety of Motion, as flying and running, which in a Cage they have not; but being confined to a narrow compaſs, have very little or no motion at all, which if the Cage be not often ſhifted with Gravel, the Dung clogs to their Feet, and makes them numb, which cauſes the Cramp; and another thing cauſes it alſo, When they hang them out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad and it rains, and ſo clogs and wets the Sand, that they ſitting all Night upon it, very often cauſes it ſo; if you hang them out, and the Sun ſhine not to dry it, they ought to have freſh Sand to be given them, and the Pearch lined that they may take a delight to ſit upon it, keeps them very neat, and are not ſubject to clog, and ſings with far more pleaſure, then when he lies at the bottom of the Cage, and is not ſeen ſitting upon the Pearch, alſo cauſes their Song to ſeem more laviſh, for the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Cage takes off the life of the Song. Next is the giddineſs of the Head, which is occaſioned by feeding upon much Hemp-Seed; which when at firſt you perceive, give him of your Gentles that you fiſh withal, if you can get them; if not, give him ſome Hog-Lice, or ſome Emets and their Eggs, and put in his Water three or four ſlices of Licoriſh, and it will immediately help him.

               <head>How to take the Old Skie-Lark ſeveral ways, and the way of ordering when taken.</head>
               <p>I Shewed you when I treated of the Wood-Lark, how he was taken with a Hobby and Nets, by which this Lark may be taken alſo, which is not
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:103298:44"/>
needful to repeat again; but we have ſome more ways for taking of this Skie-Lark, as I ſhall direct you according to my beſt ability. This Lark is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in dark Nights with a Net called a Trammel, it is a Net of 36 yards long, and ſix yards over, run through with ſix ribs of Pack-thread; which Ribs are at the ends put upon two Poles 16 foot long, made taper at each end, and ſo is carried between two Men half a yard from the Ground, every ſix ſteps touching the Ground to cauſe the Birds to fly up, otherwiſe you may carry the Net over them without diſturbing of them; ſo when you hear them fly againſt the Net, clap the Net down and they are ſafe under it: All in the <hi>Vale</hi> there is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Farmer without one of the Nets; this is a very murdering Net, taking all ſorts of Birds that it comes near, as Partridges, Quales, Wood-Cocks, Snipes, Felfares, and what not, almoſt in every dark Night; I know them that have taken 20 do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen of Larks in a Night. The next way is taking of them with a pair of Day-Nets, and a Glaſs, which indeed is very fine ſport in a clear froſty Morning; theſe Nets are commonly ſeven foot deep, and fifteen foot long, knit with your French Meaſe, and very fine Thread; I think it not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to deſcribe them, being I would not ſeem to be tedious; you can hardly ever ſet them right, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you be at firſt ſhewed by an Artiſt at it: Theſe Nets take all ſorts of ſmall Birds that come within the compaſs of the Nets, as Linnets in abundance, and your Bunting-Lark, which hath a ſhort ſort of Bill like to a Bull-Finch. The next way of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king theſe Birds, is by a Bell named a Loo-Bell; with a great Light carried in a Tub; this is a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:103298:45"/>
Sport by reaſon of its Light; but this Bell is carried by one Man, and the Tub and Candle alſo, and the Net by another: This Bell and the Light ſo amazeth them, that they lie for dead; they toſs a little Net over them. They take all ſorts of Fowls and Birds with this Bell, as Partridg, Phea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, (and if a very deep Bell, Duck, Mallard, Wood-Cock, and Snipe); This way of birding hath a great conveniency before the Trammel-Net, for with this Bell they go amongſt Buſhes, and by Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and ſhaw-ſides, where commonly your Snipes and Wood-Cocks lie; it is a ſure way for taking a Covey of Partridges. The laſt way of taking your Lark, is in a great Snow; You muſt take of Pack-thread 100 or 200 yards, and at every ſix in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches faſten a nooſe made with Horſe-Hair, (two Hairs twiſted together is ſufficient) the more Line the better, for it will reach the greater length, and conſequently have the more Sport; at every twenty yards you muſt have a little ſtick to thruſt into the Ground, and ſo go on till it be all ſet, (I know them that have a thouſand yards); then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Nooſes ſcatter ſome white Oats from one end to the other, and you will find the Larks flock extraordinary; and when three or four are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken (for you will have them by the Neck, Leg, or very Claw) ſee and take them out, for elſe they may make the others ſhie; and when you are at one end, they will be at the other end a-feeding, ſo you need not fear ſcaring of them away, for it makes them more eager at their Food; if it be after Chriſtmaſs before the Snow fall, thoſe Birds ſeldom or never prove good for ſinging; but take them that you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to keep for ſinging in <hi>Octob.</hi> or <hi>Nov.</hi> and then

they will ſing a little after Chriſtmaſs; chuſe out the ſtreighteſt, largeſt, and loftieſt Bird, and he that hath moſt white in his Tail, for theſe are the uſual Marks for a Cock: You muſt provide him a Cage as large as two of the Wood-Lark Cages, and let there be a Diſh in the middle of the Cage, or at one end, according to your fancy, and put always ſome Water in when you place the Turf in it, for the Water cauſeth the Turf to grow in the Cage; if you find him very wild and buckiſh, tie his Wings for two or three weeks, till he is become both ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted and tame alſo; then when you perceive him pretty orderly, untie his Wings, ſtill letting him hang in the ſame place he did. You muſt feed this old Bird with Hemp-Seed, Bread, and a few white Oats, for he takes great delight to husk the Oats; and when he begins to ſing, once in a week you may give him a hard Egg, or ſhred him a little boiled Mutton, or Veal, or Sheeps-Heart. You muſt obſerve in this Bird, as in all others, That you give no Salt Meat, nor no Bread that is any thing Salt.</p>

               <head>Concerning the Throſtle, and the ſeveral kinds.</head>
               <p>THere be five ſorts or kinds of Throſtles, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as I have obſerved. The firſt ſort, and largeſt of them, is your Miſtle-Throſtle, which is far bigger and larger than of the other ſorts, and his Food is far different from all the other kinds, and very few to be ſeen; he is the beautifulleſt Bird of all the five, but ſings the leaſt, except he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways breeds near where ſtore of Miſtletoe is, and if he can poſſible, in a very thick place, or in ſome
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:103298:46"/>
Pit, for he is a very melancholy ſort of Bird; he makes as large a Neſt as a Jay, and lays as big an Egg; He builds commonly with rotten Twigs the out-ſide of his Neſt, and the in-ſide is dead Graſs, Hey, or Moſs that he pulls from Trees, (this Bird delights mightily in old Orchards, where common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is much Feed upon the Apple-Trees) ſhe ſeldom lays above five Eggs, but four moſt commonly; ſhe breeds but twice a year, and hath three young ones, never above four as I could find; ſhe feeds all her young ones with the Berries of the Miſſeltoe, and nothing elſe as ever I could perceive, having diligently watched them two or three hours toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Many Writers are of opinion, That this Bird is an excellent Remedy againſt Convulſions and Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-Sickneſs; for this reaſon, That the Miſſeltoe is ſo good (and he continually feeding upon nothing elſe) a Remedy againſtit, and is an approved ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Medicine: The way of uſing it is, To kill him, and dry him to a Pouder, and take the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of a peny-weight every morning, in ſix ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls of the diſtilled Water of Miſletoe-Berries, or Black-Cherry Water, faſting an hour after; and they ſay one Bird taking will certainly effect the Cure; I never did experiment the truth of it, but in my opinion it ſtands to a great deal of reaſon: It's no chargeable Medicine, only finding of a Neſt, or ſhooting an old Bird, and make tryal.</p>
               <p>The young Birds taken about fourteen days old, are eaſie to be brought up, being a very hardy Bird; but I think it will not anſwer your expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion if you breed him for Song, for he hath a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed rambling Song, and not laviſh neither; the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:103298:46"/>
young ones are fed with Bread and Hemp-Seed, and a little Sheeps-Heart between whiles; it's a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Bird for a voletie, and will breed like Pigeons if rightly ordered.</p>
               <p>The next is your Felfare or Northern Throſtle, which comes to us after <hi>Michaelmaſs,</hi> and tarries here all the Winter, and departs the firſt of <hi>March;</hi> Their Feed with us is Hips and Haws in hard Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in open Weather Worms and young Graſs, lieing altogether upon Meadow or Paſture-Grounds; they come in very great numbers, and go away alſo in Flocks. They breed upon certain Rocks near the Sea-ſide, in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where they are in abundance, and have Young three or four times every year; I have taken them in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers at Winter with your Bird-Lime, as I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore directed you in the laſt Addition; I have for curioſity kept one in a Cage to ſee if they had any Song, but I found it not worth my labour, for when Spring came, he made nothing but a chatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo that I found him far better for a Spit than a Cage, they being excellent Meat when they are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Fat, which is commonly in hard Weather; in open Weather they are very bitter, and not worth eating.</p>
               <p>The next is your Wind-Throſtle, which comes along with this Felfare or Northern-Throſtle, but is much ſmaller, with a dark red under his Wing; This Bird breeds in Woods and Shawes, as your Song-Throſtles in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and hath an indifferent Song, far exceeding the two former: In <hi>February,</hi> in fine Weather, the Sun ſhining, they will get ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many together upon a Tree, and ſing two or three hours; ſome do fancy their Song, by reaſon
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:103298:47"/>
it is not harſh, but a pretty kind of ſweet chattering Note like unto the Swallow, only a little louder. I think them not worth ones pains to keep them, for they will not ſing above three months, and ſo give off.</p>
               <p>The next is the Wood-Song Throſtle, which is a very rare Song-Bird; firſt, For the great variety of his Notes; and ſecondly, For the laviſhneſs in his Song; this, as in all other Birds, one far exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another in Song, though Birds of the ſame kind. Thirdly, He continues longer than any Bird in Song, continuing at leaſt nine months in a year. This Bird is ſo well known to moſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men, that it needs no Deſcription; He is very good for Man's Food, but I never could endure to kill them, by reaſon they are ſo fine Song-Birds. The Hen makes her Neſt in the beginning of <hi>March</hi> (which Froſt and Snow, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard Weather) upon the ſtump of an old Tree, or ſide of the Coppice by a Ditch, according as ſhe finds food and ſtuff moſt convenient for. her Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Food for her young ones. She maketh her Neſt of Moſs that grows upon old ſtumps of Trees that are in the Woods; ſhe faſhions her Neſt round and deep with Moſs, and ſome dry Graſs; when ſhe hath compleated the firſt part, ſhe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully, and after a moſt exact and cunning way, daubs the in-ſide with a ſort of Earth called your Loam, that the poor People in the Country Plaiſter their Walls with; ſhe doth it ſo ſmooth and even, and all with her Bill, that it goes beyond the Art of Man to perform with any Tools; and the Bird common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leaves a Hole in the middle of the bottom of her Neſt, which I ſuppoſe may be to this end, That it
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:103298:47"/>
may not be drowned upon any ſudden violent Showers, or long continuance of Rain, which by this Hole at the bottom, ſhe preſerves both her Eggs and Young Ones from being killed and drowned, which if not ſo provided, might prove to the deſtruction of both: They breed commonly three times in a year, if they meet with no diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance or caſualties by the way; if the Weather be fine and warm, they go very ſoon to Neſt; the firſt commonly is hatched in <hi>April,</hi> and now and then at the latter end of <hi>March,</hi> the ſecond in <hi>May,</hi> and the third in <hi>June;</hi> but the firſt Birds prove moſt uſually the beſt and ſtouteſt Birds. The Throſtle taken in the Neſt, may be at fourteen days old, and muſt be kept pretty warm and neat, not ſuffering them to ſit upon their Dung if it fall into the Neſt, but ſo contrive it, that they may dung over the Neſt whilſt they are young and ſmall; you muſt feed them with raw Meat, and ſome Bread mixed and chopped together with ſome bruiſed Hemp-Seed, wet your Bread and mix it with your Meat: When they begin to be well-feathered, put them in a large Cage, and put ſome dry Moſs at the bottom, and let them have two or three Pearches, that ſo they may ſit or lie at their pleaſure, for you muſt know that the Throſtle, if not clean kept, is ſubject to the Cramp, and will neither ſing nor take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in himſelf: you may by degrees give him no Heart at all, for Bread and Hemp-Seed is as good Meat for him, as the beſt Sheeps-Heart and Egg is for a Nightingal: be ſure to give him freſh Water twice in a week, that ſo he may bath himſelf and prune himſelf, otherwiſe he will not thrive; take
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:103298:48"/>
that Neſt where you find the old Bird to ſing well, for he always ſings near the Neſt.</p>
               <p>The fifth is your Heath-Throſtle, which is the ſmalleſt of three ſorts that we have in <hi>England,</hi> you ſhall know him by his dark Breaſt; ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys call them Meviſſes, for they differ in their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, Song, and way of Breeding. This Bird, in my Opinion, far exceeds that which we generally call the Song-Throſtle, being far ſweeter in his Notes than the other, and a neater Bird in his Plume. The Hen builds by the Heath-ſide, either in a Frus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſh, or by a Ditch-ſide in the ſtump of an old Haw-Thorn, and ſeldom haunts the Woods and Shawes as the other doth. This Bird's Neſt is more difficult to be found than the other, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ten Neſts of the other for one of this. She builds with a long green Ground-Moſs, and makes her Neſt much deeper than the former and leſs, and begins not to breed till the middle of <hi>April,</hi> and breeds but twice in a year, and is a fine tame neat Bird, and will ſing nine months in the year, if well fed, and kept clean, both from Dung and Vermin. You muſt breed up theſe young ones af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame manner that the other was ordered in all things.</p>

               <head>How to know a Cock-Throſtle from a Hen, in Young and Old.</head>
               <p>THis is a very difficult Bird to know both when Young and Old; I ſhall give you the Opinion and Judgment of ſeveral others, and my own at laſt: The ancient Rule amongſt Country-People, was, to chuſe the top-Bird of the Neſt, as they term it, that is the largeſt and moſt feathered ſtouteſt Bird, which commonly lies uppermoſt, for they ſay it is the Nature of the Cock, from the very Neſt, to get on top of the Hens Back. Another chuſes him to be the Male Bird that hath the fulleſt Eye, and moſt Speckles upon his Breaſt, and deeper down to his Belly. A third makes choice of a Cock, for the largeneſs of his Spots, and darkeſt, and a white Gullet, with two black ſtreaks on each ſide. Another chuſes him by the Pinion of his Wing, if it hath a very dark black that goes a-croſs it. Now at laſt I ſhall give you my own Judgment; Firſt, I take notice of his Gullet to be very white, with black Streaks on each ſide; and then to have his Spots upon his Breaſt to be large and black, and the colour of his Head to be of a light ſhining brown, with black ſtreaks under each Eye, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Pinion of the Wing; theſe are the Marks I moſt commonly chuſe them by: But if you will be ſure not to fail, obſerve my Counſel; Bring up a whole Neſt, and in a ſhort time after they teed themſelves, you will find them Record to themſelves. ☞ Note, The Hens will Record as well as the Cocks, but it is with ſhort catches and jerks, and not continues it long; but the Cock is full, and you
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:103298:49"/>
will perceive his Gullet to extend it ſelf much more than the others, and to ſing much oftner than the Hen; when you have obſerved them two or three times, take him out of the Cage and mark him, and put him in again; then obſerve again, and ſee if it be the ſame Bird you marked, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving this way you ſhall never fail; but in the other ſometimes you may, for every Country alters the Plumes of the Birds, which muſt of neceſſity cauſe your Judgment and Marks to err.</p>

               <head>Of the King of Birds, or the little King, called the Robin Red-Breaſt.</head>
               <p>THe next, in my opinion, for a Song-Bird, is the little Robin Red-Breaſt; he ſingeth very ſweetly, and I have heard many to eſteem him lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle inferior to the Nightingal: I muſt tell you, That were he as hard to be had as the Nightingal, I do not know but that he might have as great an eſteem as him; but plenty of any Bird, or of any thing elſe, makes them not ſet by nor valued, though never ſo good in its Kind. This Bird is known to every little Boy, by reaſon they are ſeen at Winter upon the Tops and Roofs of Houſes, and upon all ſorts of old Ruins, on that ſide moſt commonly that the Sun riſeth and ſhineth in the morning, or under ſome Covert, where the Cold and Wind may not pinch him, for he is but a tender Bird, and hath moſt uſually his Cage lined and made after the form of a Nightingal-Cage; they breed very early in the Spring, and commonly three times in a year, in <hi>April, May,</hi> and <hi>June:</hi> They make their Neſts with a dry greeniſh Moſs, and quilt it within with
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:103298:49"/>
a little Wood and Hair; they ſeldom have above five young ones, and not under four: They build in ſome old Hay-Houſe, or Barn, or Reek of Hey or Corn; and when they are about ten days old, you may take them from the old ones, and keep them in a little Basket or Box; if you let them tarry too long in the Neſt, they will be ſullen, and ſo conſequently much more trouble, and not ſo fit to be brought up under another Bird, that whiſtled to; you muſt feed them with Sheep-Heart and Egg minced ſmall, in all points as you feed the Nightingals, and but a little at once, and pretty of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, by reaſon of his bad digeſtion, for if you give him too much at a time, he is very apt to throw it up again, which is a ſign that he is not long-lived. Be ſure he lie warm, and eſpecially in the Night: When you find them begin to be ſtrong, you may Cage them, and let them have ſome Moſs at the bottom of the Cage and ſtand warm; put the Meat in a Pan or Box, both of the Sheeps-Heart and Egg, and the Paſte that you were formerly directed to make; and let him alſo have ſome of the Wood-Larks mixed Meat by them, for thoſe I brought up with Sheeps-Heart and Egg, when they came to feed themſelves, would rather eat the Paſte and Wood-Larks Meat, than the Sheeps-Heart and Egg; you may give him, which you will, according to your conveniency; every Boy knows almoſt how to take Robin with a Pit-Fall; but with a Trap-Cage and a Meal-Worm you may take a dozen in a day: And if you hear one Bird to excel another, take the Bird you have moſt mind to, and Cage him, and he will ſing in a ſhort time, provided he be not an old Bird. If you take a Bird, and do not hear
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:103298:50"/>
him ſing, by this Mark you ſhall know whether he be a Cock or Hen; if a Cock, his Breaſt will be of a darker red, a greater matter than the Hen, and his red will go up farther upon the Head.</p>

The beſt Remedy to prevent him from having the Cramp, is, To keep him warm and clean in his Cage, that his Feet be not clogged, which many times do eat the Joints off his Feet, with the Dung being bound on ſo faſt, that it makes his Feet and Nails to rot off, which takes off the Life and Spirit of the Bird; if you find him droop, and is ſickiſh, give him three or four Meal-Worms and Spiders, and it will mightily refreſh him: but for the giddineſs in the Head, give him ſix or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Ear-Wigs in a week, and he ſhall never be troubled with it, which is very ſubject to your Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins above all other Birds, except the Bull-finch: If you find he hath little appetite to eat, give him now and then ſix or ſeven Hog-Lice, which you may find in any piece of old rotten Wood: be ſure he never wants Water that is freſh two or three times a week.

               <p>I Hold the little Creature to be a curious fine Song-Bird, ſo not unworthy to be taken notice of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the little Birds of the Cage: He is of a fine chearful Nature, and ſingeth ſweetly and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly, none exceeding him for the nature of the Song he ſings; he is a pretty ſpeckled coloured Bird, very pleaſing to the ſight, and when he ſings, cocks up his Tayl, and throws out his Notes with ſuch pleaſure and chearfulneſs, that for his bigneſs none exceeds him. This Bird breeds twice a year, firſt, About the latter end of <hi>April,</hi> and makes her Neſt with dry Moſs and Leaves, and doth it ſo artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, that it is a very hard matter to diſcover it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is amongſt Shrubs or Hedges where Ivy grows very thick; they will build in old Hovels and Barns, but them are thoſe that are not uſed to the Hedges; they cloſe their Neſt round, leaving but one little Hole to go in and out at; ſhe lays a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Eggs, I have had eighteen out of one Neſt, which would ſeem very ſtrange, if it were not a thing ſo generally common; I have had ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen young ones out of a Neſt: It's to admiration how ſo ſmall a little-bodied Bird can cover ſo great a company of Eggs; I am perſwaded the Cock and Hen ſits both together; but when they have hatched, to feed ſo great a company and not to miſs the Bird, and in the dark alſo, 'tis a very curious thing to conſider. Their ſecond time of breeding is in the middle of <hi>June,</hi> for by that time the other Neſt will be brought up and ſhift for themſelves; But if you intend to keep any of them, take them
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:103298:51"/>
out at twelve or fourteen days old from the Neſt: You ſhall give them Sheeps-Heart and Egg minced very ſmall, taking away the Fat and the Sinews, or elſe of Calves or Heifers-Heart. Obſerve in all Meat-Birds, to cleanſe the Meat or Heart of all the Fat and Sinews; and if it be Beef, let it be well bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and ſhred very ſmall, becauſe of digeſtion. You ſhall feed them in their Neſt very often in a day, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them one or two morſels at a time and no more, leſt they ſhould caſt it up again, by receiving more than they can bear or digeſt, and ſo die: You muſt feed them with a little Stick, and take up the Meat at the end about the bigneſs of a white Pea; when you perceive them to pick it from the Stick them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, then put them into a Cage, and having a Pan or two, put ſome of the ſame Meat in it, and about the ſides of the Cage alſo to entice her to eat; notwithſtanding you muſt feed them five or ſix times in a day for better ſecurity, leſt they ſhould neglect themſelves and die, when all your trouble is almoſt paſt. After they have found the way to feed alone, give them by degrees of your Paſte now and then, and if you perceive them to eat heartily, and like it very well, you may forbear giving them any more Heart, when you find they are accuſtomed to eat the Paſte with delight. Furthermore, You muſt, once in two or three days, give them a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or two.

Of all Birds that I know, this is one of the ſhieſt, for if ſhe perceive you to mind her when ſhe is Building, ſhe will forſake it, and if you touch an Egg, ſhe never comes to her Neſt more; for you can very hardly go to it, but ſhe will immediately ſpie you, and if ſhe chance to have young ones, ſhe will either ſtarve them, or break their Necks, with throwing them out of the Neſt; for I can ſpeak it of my own knowledg, That I having found a Neſt in a hole of a hollow Tree, took one out of the Neſt to ſee how fledg'd they were, and immediately put it in again; and having occaſion to come that way the next morning, I found them all dead under the Tree, which made me admire; but ſince I have tryed two or three more, and they are all of one nature for doggedneſs; but if you bring them up young, they alter their Nature and become very

tame and pleaſant to their Keeper. You muſt take them out of the Neſt about ten days old, for if you let them be too long in the Neſt, they are apt to learn ſome of the old Birds temper, and be very ſullen. Theſe Birds are fed with Sheeps-Heart and Egg minced and chopped very ſmall, and given at the end of a Stick, when they open their Mouths, about the quantity of three white Peas; for if you clog their Stomachs too much, they will preſently caſt their Meat, and in a ſhort time die. When you perceive him to eat off the Meat from the Stick, Cage them up, and put their Meat in a Pan, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſides of the Cage; not ceaſing, though he feeds of himſelf, to give him three or four times a day a bit or two, for he will hardly eat his fill for the firſt three or four days he begins to feed alone; but when you have accuſtomed him to eat five or ſix days without feeding, give him ſome of the Nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingals Paſte, and you will find him very much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in it: You may keep him in what Cage you pleaſe, only let him be warm in Winter, and he will ſing in the Night as well as in the Day.

This is a very tractable Bird, and will take any Birds Song almoſt if taken young out of the Neſt.

She is very jealous, both of her Eggs and young Ones; ſhe maketh her Neſt in Holes, and chiefly of old Banks, or in the holes of old hollow Trees:
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:103298:54"/>
ſhe builds with any Materials which lies next to her Habitation, and moſt nigh and convenient to her Neſt; for ſhe is a very idle Bird, and now and then doth not lay together ſtuff enough to keep her young warm.

This Bird is known to every one, and is better to be eaten than kept, and is much ſweeter to the Palat being dead and well-roaſted, than to the Ear when they are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, for they are delicate Meat if very fat. She maketh her Neſt many times when the Woods are full of Snow, which happeneth very often in the beginning of <hi>March.</hi> She builds her Neſt upon old ſtumps of Trees, by Ditch-ſides or in a thick Hedg, they are at no certainty like other Birds; She makes the out-ſides of her Neſt with dry Graſs and Moſs, and little dry Sticks and Roots of Trees, and daubs all the inſide of the Neſt with a kind of Clay-Earth, faſhioning it ſo round, and forms it ſo handſome and ſmooth that Man cannot mend it; they breed three or four times a year, according as they loſe their Neſt, for if their Neſts be taken away they breed the ſooner.

               <p>THis Bird we had formerly brought over from the <hi>Canaries</hi> and no-where elſe, and ſo is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally known by that name; but of late years we have had abundance of their kind come out of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> ſo we call them by the name of the Country, <hi>German-Birds;</hi> but I believe the firſt Original were brought from the <hi>Canary-Iſlands.</hi> The Birds brought from the <hi>Canaries</hi> are not ſo much in eſteem with us as formerly, for the Birds brought out of <hi>Germany</hi> far excel them in handſomneſs and Songs, the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-</hi>Birds having very many fine Jerks and Notes of the Nightingals, which in its place I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare how they came to have. Many Country-Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple cannot diſtinguiſh a Canary from one of our common Green-Birds; but if they would diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerve how the paſſages of his Throat heaves when he is ſinging, they might quickly diſtinguiſh him from any other Bird, let him be of any manner of colour; and beſides, he is luſtier by much, and hath a longer Tail. Note, Thoſe Canaries that have the motion of turning their Heads backward, are ſeldom or never good. The Nature of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary is quite contrary to other Birds, for as others are ſubject to be fat they never are, (I mean the Cocks) for the great mettle of the Bird, and his laviſh ſinging, will hardly ſuffer him to maintain fleſh upon his back, much leſs fat.</p>

               <p>IN the firſt place let him be a long Bird, ſtanding ſtreight, and not crouching, but ſpritely like unto a Sparrow-Hauk, ſtanding with life and boldneſs, and not ſubject to be fearful; I would adviſe all People that intend to buy your Canary-Iſland Birds, or German-Canaries, ſo lately called, firſt to hear them ſing, and then they ſhall be ſure not to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zened one way, to buy Hens for Cocks. And then alſo in the ſecond place, they ſhall pleaſe their Ears, for one fancies a ſweet Song-Bird, and another a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry laviſh Bird if he be not ſweet; and all phanſie, I think, a long Song-Bird, and you chuſe what pleaſes you beſt, and I'le aſſure you one ſhilling is very ill-ſaved, to buy them as they run out of the Store-Cage, for if you have but one Hen in twelve, your ſhilling in a Bird is quickly loſt; and ten to one but ſome of the Cocks too hath little or no Song to be taken notice of, therefore be adviſed to hear him in a ſingle Cage, that you may be able to judg ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his Song before you part with your Mony. Now moſt are of Opinion, that your Canary that hath moſt variety of Notes, and is the longeſt Song-Bird, is the beſt; but Mens Opinions vary as the Birds Songs.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Some approve of your Canary, that whisk and chew like unto your Tit-Lark, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it is a ſpritely Note.</p>
               <p>A ſecond is for a Canary that begins like unto a Skie-Lark, and ſo continues his Song much after the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:103298:56"/>
rate of his ſinging, having a long Note and ſweet but I think not much variety in it.</p>
               <p>A third approves of the Canary that begins the Skie-Lark, and runs upon the Notes of the Nightin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals Song; which I do think, if he doth it well, is one of the pleaſanteſt Birds in the World.</p>
               <p>A fourth likes a Bird that hath a loud laviſh Note, not at all reſpecting either variety or length, ſo he makes but a noiſe in his ears.</p>
               <p>So ſome phanſie the way of ſinging after the Tit-Lark, ſome after the Skie-Lark, and almoſt all after the Nightingal, and few or none after the way of the Chaff-Finch.</p>

The next is, if he dung very thin like Water, with no thickening, he is not right. And laſt of all, if he dung with a ſlimy white, and no blackneſs in it, it is a dangerous ſign that Death
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:103298:57"/>
is approaching, and he will not continue long with you. But when in perfect health, his Dung lies round and hard, with a fine white on the out-ſide, and dark within, and will quickly be dry; and the larger the Birds Dung is, I hold it the better, ſo it be long, round, and hard.

               <head>Concerning the ordering of Canary-Birds when they begin to build, or them they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for breeding.</head>
               <p>IN the firſt place, You muſt make a convenient Cage, or elſe prepare a Room that may be fit for ſuch a buſineſs; you muſt be ſure to let it have an out-let towards the riſing of the Sun, where you muſt have a piece of Wire, that they may have egreſs and regreſs at their pleaſure: When you have prepared a convenient Room, then ſet up in the corners of it ſome Brooms, either Heath or Frail, opening them in the middle; if the Room be pretty high, you may ſet two or three Brooms under one another; but then you muſt ſet Partitions with Boards over the top of every Broom, otherwiſe they will dung upon one anothers Heads; and alſo they will not ſuffer to ſee one another ſo near each others Neſt, for the Cock or Hen will be apt to fly upon a Hen that is not matched to them, when they ſee them juſt under their Neſt, which many times cauſes the ſpoiling of their Eggs and Young Ones. In the next place, you muſt cauſe ſomething to be made ſo convenient, and of ſuch a bigneſs, that may hold Meat for ſome conſiderable time, that you may not be diſturbing of them continually, and a
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:103298:57"/>
convenient Veſſel for Water alſo; let your place where you intend to put your Seeds, be ſo ordered, that it may hang out of the reach of the Mice, for they will deſtroy all the Canary-Seeds, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently may ſtarve your Canary-Birds. You muſt likewiſe prepare ſome ſtuff to build withal of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſorts of things, as Cotton-Wool, ſmall dead Graſs, your Elks-Hair, and your long ſort of Moſs that grows along upon the Ground by your Ditch-ſides, or in the Woods; you muſt dry it before you put them together, then mingle them all, and put them up into a little Net like unto a Cabbage-Net, hanging of it ſo that they may with conveniency pull it out. You muſt ſet Pearches all about your Room, and if big enough, ſet a Tree in the middle of it, that ſo they may take the more pleaſure. You muſt proportion your Birds according to the bigneſs of your Room, rather let it be under-ſtocked than over, for they are Birds that love their liberty.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <head>What things are moſt needful when they begin to breed.</head>
               <p>IN the firſt place, when you perceive them begin to build and carry ſtuff, give them once a day, or in two days at leaſt, a little Greens, and ſome Loaf-Sugar, for that will cauſe a ſlipperineſs in the Body, that ſo the Eggs may come forth without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring the Birds, for many times the Bird dies in laying her firſt Egg, which is a great loſs to the breeder ſeveral ways: As firſt, to the loſs of his firſt breed; then next, to the unpairing of the Cock, to which you ſhould put in another Hen, whether he will pair or no; ſo that Cock would be far better
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:103298:58"/>
taken out, than ſuffered to tarry in your Breeding-Place, eſpecially if it be a ſmall place; but with pairs in a large place he cannot do that injury; and it will be very hard to diſtinguiſh which Hens Cock that dyed, and as hard to take him in a large place, without doing more injury than the Bird comes to; therefore let him reſt till the end of the year, when you draw them out to part them. If you have but two or three pair together, it will be the beſt way to take him out and match him with another Hen, and then put him in again: And alſo when you find that they have built their Neſts, you may take away the Nets that have their breeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuff in them, for they will be ſubject to build upon their Eggs with new ſtuff, if they do not lay pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently.</p>
               <p>They do breed moſt uſually three times in a year, begin in <hi>April,</hi> and breed <hi>May</hi> and <hi>June,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> which is not very uſual neither here nor in <hi>Germany.</hi>

               <p>I Shall ſhew you every thing exactly how they breed them in <hi>Germany,</hi> according to the beſt information that I have received of thoſe that have ſeen them and bred them alſo. In the firſt place, Prepare a large Room, and build it in the likeneſs of a Barn, being much longer than broad; and at each end there is a ſquare place, and ſeveral holes at each end to go into thoſe ſquare places; in thoſe Out-lets they plant ſeveral ſorts of fine Trees, which grow pretty thick, (for they will take much delight both to ſing and breed in them); and at the bottom
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:103298:58"/>
of the place they ſtrew it with a fine ſort of Sand, with which they ſtrew ſeeds of Rape, Chick-weed, and Groundſell; which the Old Bird doth eat both at time of laying, and alſo when they have young ones: they put in the Houſe all ſorts of ſtuff for the building of their Neſts, they put Brooms up and down all the corners, one under another, and to the highth of the place that is built for the purpoſe; and make partitions between every Neſt, to make them breed the quieter, without diſturbing one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; and in the middle of the Room they will ſet a board edge-ways to darken the light of each ſide: for no Bird almoſt doth naturally love to have much light come to his Neſt. They plant a Tree or two, if the Houſe be big enough, one at each end, with many perches alſo along each ſide of the Houſe, and all along where they make their Neſts; and in the place that is the Air, it is alſo full of perches, they hang their ſtuff for building all up and down the Houſe, that the rain cannot come at it, and ſtrew ſome in the ground alſo; they make places very convenient every one according to his fancy, and for their Water alſo, ſome having fine Fountains in thoſe places, that are the out-lets for the Birds, to go at pleaſure into the Air, in which the Birds take very much delight to waſh and prune them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and it makes the Seeds to grow up that are thrown in upon the Sand.</p>

               <p>THey ſeldom take their Neſts away to bring them up by hand, as we do here, but they let the old Birds always bring them up; and when
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:103298:59"/>
they are pretty ſtout, and can crack hard Seeds, they have ſmall places for the young to come to feed, and they give them of all ſorts of Green-Seeds to feed upon, and have a kind of clap-door to take them: they ſay, if they do not ſoak Seeds for the Young ones, that very few will live, by reaſon the Hen is apt to forſake them, (and the Seeds being very hard, they pine away and die) and go to Neſt again. This Man alſo did truly affirm, they never came to any perfection till they came to have Birds of their own breeding in their own Countrey, and then being ſeaſoned to the Countrey they breed in abundance, furniſhing all <hi>Poland, Germany,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and of late years <hi>England,</hi> where they vent as many as any place in the World.</p>

               <head>How to breed the Young ones that are taken out of the Neſt.</head>
               <p>THeſe Birds muſt not be left too long in the Neſt, for if you do, they are very apt to grow ſullen, and will not feed kindly: therefore take them out about 9 or 10 days old, and put them in a little Basket, and cover them over with a Net, elſe they will be very ſubject to jump out upon the firſt opening of the Basket; and if they fall to the ground they will be bruiſed, and in a ſhort time conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly die. You muſt keep them very warm for the firſt week, for they will be very tender, ſubject to the Cramp, and not digeſt their Meat if they take cold.</p>
               <p>When you take them from the Old <hi>Canaries,</hi> take them in the Evening; and if you can poſſibly let the old Birds be out of ſight, otherwiſe they will be very apt to take diſtaſt when they ſit again, and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:103298:59"/>
have young ones; and will be apt at every fright to forſake both their Young and Eggs. When you have taken them out and put them in a Basket covered at top: Make their Meat after this manner; Take ſome of your largeſt Rape-Seeds, and ſoak them in water 24 hours or leſs, if the Water be a little warm, I think 12 hours will ſerve: drain the Water from the Seeds, and put a third part of white Bread to the Seeds, and a little Canary-Seed in flower, and ſo mix them all together; then hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſmall ſtick, take up a little at the end, and give every Bird ſome 2 or 3 times over; give them but a little at firſt, and often, for if you over-charge their Stomachs at the firſt, they ſeldom thrive after it; and alſo they will caſt up their Meat, which is a ſure ſign they will not live long after it: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take a great care at firſt to feed them by degrees, that ſo their Stomachs may be able to digeſt it; for you muſt underſtand that the Old ones give them a little at a time, and the Meat they receive from them, is warmed in the Stomach before they give it them; and then all the Rape is huld, which lies not ſo hard at the Stomach as thoſe Seeds which have the skins on. Therefore much care muſt be uſed at the firſt, to preſerve their Stomachs and keep them in health. You muſt not make the Meat too dry, for then they will be apt to be vent-burnt, by reaſon all the Seeds are hot; for I have obſerved that the Old-Birds do conſtantly drink after they have eaten Seeds, and a little before they feed their Young ones; and they commonly after feeding of them, ſit a quarter of an Hour or more, to keep them warm, that the Meat may better nouriſh them; therefore when you have fed them, cover them up
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:103298:60"/>
very warm, that their Meat may the better digeſt with them.</p>

The beſt approved thing that I know of, is to make an Ointment of Freſh Butter and Capons-Greaſe melted together, and anoint the Top of the Birds Head for 2 or 3 days, and 'twill diſſolve it, and cure him; but if you let him alone too long, then after you have anointed him 3 or 4 times, ſee whether it be ſoft upon his Head; if it be, open it gently, and let out the Matter which will be like unto the Yolk of an Egg, then anoint the Place with ſome of the Ointment, and it will immediatly cure him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further trouble: if you do perceive the Impoſtume at any time to return, do as you are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore directed; you muſt give him Figgs, and in his Water let him have a ſlice or two of Liquoriſh, and ſome Sugar-candy.</p>
               <p>The Old Birds above three years old are called <hi>Runts,</hi> and thoſe about two years old are called <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffes,</hi> and thoſe of the firſt year that the old ones bring up, are <hi>Branches:</hi> When they can crack hard Seeds, and they call them that are new-flown and cannot feed themſelves, <hi>Puſhers;</hi> and thoſe that are bred up by hand, <hi>Neſtlings;</hi> which I do approve
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:103298:60"/>
far better than any of the firſt, by reaſon of his tameneſs and familiarity with his Keeper, which is the chief pleaſure of a Bird: For if a Bird be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, and not tame, but wild or buckiſh, there is no pleaſure in feeding or hearing of him ſing, being apt upon all occaſions to bruiſe himſelf and to forſake his Singing when moſt deſired.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <head>Concerning the Linnet.</head>
               <p>THey make their Neſts in black Thorns and white-Thorns Buſhes, and in furs-Buſhes upon Heaths more than any-where elſe: They build their Neſts with very ſmall Roots, and other ſort of ſtuff like unto Feathers, thoſe that build in the Heaths; Thoſe that build in the Hedges, build with Moſs the out-ſide of their Neſt, and line it within according as the Place will afford: Some hot-metled Birds will have young ones four times in a year, eſpecially if they be taken from them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they fly out of their Neſts. The hotter the Bird is in mettle, the ſooner he breeds in the Spring. You may take the Young ones out at four days old, if you intend they ſhall learn to whiſtle, or hear any other Birds Song; for then they being ſo young, have not the Old Birds Song, and are more apt to take any thing, than if you ſuffer them to be in the Neſt till they are almoſt quite fledged. You muſt be ſure when you take them out ſo young, to keep them very warm, and to feed them but a little at a time. Your Meat muſt be ſoaked Rape-Seeds, and then bruiſe them, and put full aſmuch ſoaked white-Bread as the Seeds: you muſt make freſh every day, for if it be ſower, it immediately makes them ſcour, and not long after die. You muſt not
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:103298:61"/>
give them their Meat too dry, for if you do, it will make them vent-burned, and that's as bad as if they ſcoured. If you intend to whiſtle to them, do it when you feed them: For they will learn very much before they can crack hard Seeds; ſo hang them under any Bird that you intend, the <hi>Linnet</hi> ſhall learn his Song. The <hi>Linnet</hi> is a very apt Bird for any Tune or Song, if taken out of the Neſt very young: I have known ſeveral that have learnt to ſpeak, for there is nothing ſo hard, but labour and diligence will overcome. You may know the Cock-<hi>Linnets</hi> from the Hens by theſe two Marks: Firſt, by the Colour of the Back of the Birds; if it be of your dark-coloured <hi>Linnets,</hi> the Cocks are much browner than the Hens on the Back and Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Wing; and ſo of the White-thorn Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, the Hens being much lighter-coloured than the Cocks. But obſerve this, that a Hen <hi>Linnet</hi> of the dark-Coloured Cock, is darker than the Cock of the light-Coloured <hi>Linnet.</hi> But the ſureſt way of all is, to know him by the White in his Wing.</p>
               <p>This Bird is likewiſe troubled ſometimes with Melancholy, and then you will find the end of his Rump to be very much ſwelled, which you muſt prick with a Needle and let out all the Corruption, ſqueeſing of it out very well with the Point of the Needle; then anoint him with the Ointment made of freſh Butter and Capon-Greaſe, and feed him with ſome of theſe Herbs for two or three days; your Lettice and Beets-Seeds, and the Leaves alſo, and you may alſo give him the Seeds of Mellons chopped in pieces, which he will eat very greedily; and when you find him mend, take the Mellon-Seeds away, and give him of his old dyet again;
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:103298:61"/>
put into his Water two or three blades of Saffron and white Sugar-candy, for a week or more, till you perceive the Bird to be wholly recovered. The next Diſeaſe that this Bird is moſt troubled with, is a Scouring, which ſome are not ſo dangerous as others: The firſt ſort of Scouring, which I count not very hurtful, is very thin and with a black or white Subſtance in the middle: this is not very dangerous, for I have known very many ſing very ſtrong and laviſh, when they have had this Scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a very violent manner, and not been in the leaſt hurtful. The next ſort of Scouring is between a black and a white, but not ſo thin as the other, but is very clammy and ſticking, which is never very good in a Bird; this is recovered by giving your Bird at the firſt ſome Mellon-Seed ſhred, and Lettice-Seeds and Beet-Seeds bruiſed, and ſo give him in his Water ſome Liquoriſh and white Sugar-candy, with a little flower of Oat-Meal in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. You muſt be diligent at the firſt to obſerve him when he is ſick, that ſo he may have a ſtomach to eat, for in two or three days his Stomach will be quite gone, and then it will be hard recovering of him again. The next and worſt ſort of Scouring of all the three, is the white clamming Scouring; which is very bad and mortal, if it be not well looked after at the firſt: This is occaſioned by bad Seeds, and many times for want of Water, Seeds that have taken any dammage at Sea, or have been over-heated, or lain in the wet too long before they have been houſed, is a very great occaſion of this Diſtemper. If they be not taken at the firſt appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, it immediately takes away his Stomach, and cauſeth him to droop &amp; fall from his Meat immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately:
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:103298:62"/>
Therefore obſerve this cure for him; In the firſt place give him Flax-Seeds, taking away all his other Seeds; then give him of your Plantain-Seed if it be green, otherwiſe it will do him no good; if you cannot get Plantain-Seeds, give him ſome of the Leaves ſhred very ſmall, and ſome Oat-Meal bruiſed with a few crums of Bread; and in his Water give him ſome white Sugar-candy and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoriſh, with a Blade or two of Saffron; You muſt obſerve, if you can poſſible, the firſt beginning of this Diſtemper, otherwiſe when his Stomach is loſt, all theſe Medicines ſignifie nothing.</p>

               <head>How to know a Cock from a Hen.</head>
               <p>THis Bird is a very good and melodious Bird in his kind, thoſe which are bred out of the Neſt proving much better than the Wild ones. There be two ſorts of <hi>Linnets,</hi> your black-Thorn and white-Thorn <hi>Linnet,</hi> or your black-Maled or white-Maled Bird, one being of a brown Plume, and the other of a light Grey: moſt do account the blacked Male the hardier Bird, and the hotter-metled Bird alſo. But I am of opinion that they all take after the Old ones, let the old ones be high-metled Birds, let them be Brown or Grey, the young Birds take after them, which is thus: Take your young Linnet when the Wing-Feathers are grown, and ſtretch out his Wing, holding of his Body faſt with the other hand (otherwiſe I have known them upon a ſudden jerk to break their Wings) and then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the white upon the Feathers of the 4th, 5th, and 6th Feather, if it caſt a gliſtning white, and the white goes cloſe to the Quil; this is a ſure

ſign of a Cock: Take a Hen and a Cock together, and you ſhall perceive it better. This is the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineſt way not to be deceived, to keep a Hen inſtead of a Cock, for it is not ſo much the coſt in keeping of the Bird, but our diſappointment in the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of having ſome pleaſure after our trouble and care, eſpecially to them that take delight to whiſtle to him Tunes.</p>

               <head>The ſeveral Diſeaſes that the Linnet is Subject to.</head>
               <p>FIrſt, She is ſubject unto the Diſeaſe called the <hi>Pthiſick,</hi> which may eaſily be perceived by ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him pant, and to heave his Belly faſt, and ſit melancholy, with his Feathers ſtanding big and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and by the Belly when it ſhews it ſelf more puffed up than ordinary, full of reddiſh veins, and his Breaſt very lean and ſharp, and ſeeing him ſpill and caſt his Seeds about the Cage, not caring to eat at all. This Diſeaſe comes to the <hi>Linnet</hi> many times for want of Water, and having your Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lack-Seeds mingled amongſt your Rape-Seeds, and for want of giving him a little green meat at the Spring of the Year, when you perceive the Bird to begin to be troubled with this Diſeaſe, firſt to cut the end of his Rump, and to give him ſome white Sugar-candy in his Water, with two or three ſlices of Liquoriſh; for want of Sugar-candy, let him put in fine Sugar: And for his Meat you ſhall give him Beets, Lettice, to feed upon, or ſome of the Herb called <hi>Mercurie,</hi> which is a very good Herb for this Diſtemper for any Seed-Bird: you may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe give her Mellon-Seeds chopped ſmall, and at
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:103298:63"/>
the bottom of the Cage put ſome fine Gravel with a little Powder-Sugar, and a little ground Oat-Meal; you may put alſo ſome Loom, that the Country-People do daub their Walls withal inſtead of Morter and Sand, every one almoſt knows; bruiſe this ſmall, and it will bring him to a Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, if he be not too far gone and paſt cure. The <hi>Linnet</hi> is alſo ſubject unto the Streins or Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Breaſt, wherefore being oppreſſed with this Diſeaſe, you ſhall feed him with Lettice-Seeds, Beet-Seeds, and Mellon-Seeds bruiſed; and in his Water you ſhall diſſiolve ſome Sugar-candy, and ſome of the Nightingal's Paſte, with a little Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoriſh, ſo much that the Water may have a taſte of it, and ſo continue it for the ſpace of four, or five days, now and then taking of it away, and giving her Plantain-Water: be ſure to give her a Beet-Leaf, or Lettice-Leaf upon the day that you give her Plantain-Water. The <hi>Linnet</hi> is alſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto a Hoarſneſs in his Voice, which many times comes through ſtraining her Voice in ſinging, and many times ſhe gets a Husk in her Throat, which is ſeldom helped to come ſo clear off at firſt: many times alſo if it be a ſtrong-metled Bird, he will break ſomething within him, that he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come to ſing again, for the hoarſneſs which is very often taken in his Mouth, which is thus, to keep him very hot, and upon a ſudden to open his Cage to the Air, which immediately ſtrikes a cold to his Breaſt and Throat, and oftentimes kills him; for if you have a Bird in the Moult, you muſt not carry him to the Air, but keep him at a ſtay till he is moulted off, and then open him by degrees, that ſo he may not take cold; and give him after his

               <p>THe next to the <hi>Linnet</hi> of Seed-Birds is the <hi>Golden-Finch,</hi> which is a very rare and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous-coloured Bird, and were they not ſo plenty, they would be of very great eſteem amongſt us here; but plenty of any thing makes it ſlighted, and not regarded. This Bird is taken in great plenty about Michaelmaſs time, and will very ſoon become tame; the Beautifulneſs, with the pretty melodious Song that this Bird hath, cauſes very many to keep them: (They were formerly carried beyond Sea to ſeveral places for a very great Rarity.) Theſe <hi>Gold-Finches</hi> differ very much in their Tunes, for ſome of them ſing after one faſhion, and ſome after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which needed not further be proved but by them that have kept them, for it is in this Bird as in all others variety, one Bird ſurpaſſing another, both in goodneſs, variety, and laviſhneſs of Song: They breed commonly in your Apple-Trees and Plum-Trees; and to my knowledg I never ſaw a Neſt in a quickſet-Hedge. They make their Neſt of Moſs that grows upon Apple-Trees and Wool, and Quilt the inſide with all ſorts of Hair they find
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:103298:64"/>
upon the Ground: they breed three times in a year. You muſt take young ones with the Neſt about ten days old, and they muſt be fed thus: Take ſome of your beſt Hemp-ſeed, and beat it in a Morter very fine, then ſift it through a Sieve, and put as much white-Bread as Hemp-Seed, and put alſo a little flower of Canary-Seeds to it; ſo with a ſmall ſtick or quill take up as much as the bignes of a white Pea, and give them three or four bits at a time: you muſt make it freſh every day, it is ſoon done when the Hemp-Seeds are bruiſed and ſifted; if it be ſower it will immediately ſpoil their Stomachs, and cauſe them to caſt up their Meat, and then it is ten to one if they live. You muſt be ſure to keep theſe Birds very warm till they can feed themſelves, for they are very tender Birds, you may almoſt bring them up to any thing being a very tame Bird; be ſure that in feeding of this Bird you make clean his Bill and Mouth, and if any of the Meat fall upon his Feathers take it off, otherwiſe they will not thrive. This Bird that eats Hemp-Seeds, ſhall take for a Purge the Seeds of Mellons, Succory and Mercurie, which is a principal Herb for the <hi>Linnet,</hi> but this Bird you may give Lettice and Plantain, which are excellent Herbs for this Bird to purge him; and when they have no need of purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you muſt give them two or three times a week a little Sugar or ſome Loom in their Meat, or at the bottom of their Cage; to this end they may eat ſome to ſcour their Stomachs, which for want there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is the great deſtruction of our Birds that feed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Seeds: For nothing can be more wholeſome for them than Wall or Loom-Earth and ſome fine Sand, and a lump or knob or two of Sugar always
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:103298:64"/>
in their Cage; for all Seeds have a great oilineſs in them, and if they have not ſomething to dry up that Oilineſs in the Stomach, in length of time it fouls their Stomachs, and puts them into a Flux, and nothing is worſe than unſound and damaged Seeds, which in a ſhort time deſtroyes them.</p>

               <head>Concerning the Chaff-Finch.</head>
               <p>THis Bird is a very plentiful Bird, and of ſome is much admired for his Song; but I have no great fancy for him, by reaſon he ſeldom varies in his Song like unto other Birds, and hath no pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingneſs nor ſweetneſs in his Song like unto the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Birds. At flight-time this Bird is very plentifully caught, but their Neſts are very ſcanty found, as of the <hi>Gold-Finch</hi> alſo. This Bird breeds in hedges &amp; Trees of all ſorts, and makes his Neſt of Moſs and Wool, or any thing almoſt that he can gather up where ſhe breeds. They have young ones two or three times a year, but they are ſeldom bred up from the Neſt, being no Bird that is apt to take another Birds Song, nor to whiſtle; ſo they let the Old one breed them up that they may have the true Song. Your <hi>Eſſex-Finches</hi> are in all Men's Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons accounted the Beſt, both for length of ſong, and variety, ſhe ending with ſeveral notes, which is very pretty: I do not know but this Bird, if he were made tryal of, might not only take the notes of any other Bird, but alſo may be brought up to whiſtle any Tune, as well as the <hi>Canary</hi> or <hi>Linnet;</hi> and I am confident it is a hardier Bird than either of them, by reaſon he will almoſt live upon any Seeds, none coming amiſs to him: he is very ſeldom ſubject
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:103298:65"/>

               <head>Concerning the Green-Finch.</head>
               <p>THis Bird is of a very mean Song, and yet is kept by a great many people for his cheapneſs and hardineſs, and by moſt people to ring the Bells, being a good-bodied heavy Bird. This Bird is plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful in every Country, and breeds the fillieſt of any, making commonly his Neſt by the High-way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, where every Boy finds them, and deſtroys them at firſt, till the Hedges are pretty well cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with green Leaves. They breed very early in the Spring before the Hedges have leaves upon them, which cauſes every one to ſee their Neſts at firſt, ſo that ſeldom their firſt Neſts come to any thing. They build with Moſs that is green that grows at the bottom of Hedges, and quilt their Neſt very ſorrily within; and many times they are ſo ſlight, that a great Wind ſhakes them to pieces, and drops both young ones and eggs. They breed three times in a year, and the Young is a very hardy Bird to be brought up: You may feed them with ſome white-Bread and Rape ſoaked; and he is a very apt Bird to take the Whiſtle, rather than another Birds Song: All that can be ſaid of him, he is a very dull Bird, not having the Spirit of a <hi>Canary-Bird,</hi> nor a <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net;</hi> for he will never kill himſelf with ſinging or whiſtling. I have heard ſome have given great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of him, to learn to whiſtle as well as any Bird whatſoever, and that he will not be ſubject to take any Birds Song to put him out of his Notes.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:103298:65"/>
He is ſeldome ſubject to any Diſeaſe but to be too fat; and of Seed-Birds there is none like him for growing ſo exceſſive fat, if you give him Hemp-Seeds, then he is good for nothing but the ſpit, therefore give him no other but Rape-Seeds.</p>

               <head>The way to know how many Diſeaſes and Maladies all Singing-Birds are ſubject to.</head>
               <p>FIrſt, the Diſeaſes are divers according to every Birds Food, and this diverſity cauſeth divers ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and divers ſigns, which being hid, the Diſeaſe to our outward apprehenſion is unknown, and ſo there is no adminiſtring of any thing, in as much as it is not known from whence is the true Ground and Original of the Diſeaſe; ſo that no Medicine or Remedy can with any certainty be made conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for true Cure of the Diſtemper: wherefore it is very neceſſary that there ſhould be had a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard and inſpection unto the outward Signs, to know the ground of the Diſtemper that lies and lurketh within, and that no leſs in the behalf of Birds, than generally of all other Creatures: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall now endeavour briefly to gather and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect (according to my beſt skill and knowledg) in this Chapter what hath been ſcatteringly delivered in other places, touching the Infirmities and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of all kind of Singing-Birds and Diſeaſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, for the benefit and inſtruction of ſuch as would know the Diſeaſes whereunto ſuch Birds as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in, and love to keep for their own pleaſure, are ſubject to.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:103298:66"/>
Firſt, Birds are ſubject, amongſt other Diſeaſes, unto <hi>Impoſthumes;</hi> which do happen unto them, and appear in the Head of a yellow Colour, as big as a Hemp-Seed, ſometimes as big as a Pea; a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe commonly haunting all Birds, eſpecially thoſe which are of a hot Complexion.</p>
               <p>The Second kind of Diſeaſe with which moſt Birds are troubled, is a ſubtile Diſeaſe called <hi>Pthiſis;</hi> for thoſe Birds that are troubled with this Diſeaſe, do moſt commonly ſwell in their Bodies, and you may perceive, if you make a narrow ſearch, their Breaſt is beſet with veins full of Blood, though at that time the Bird be very ſharp and thin, and very lean upon the Breaſt; and thoſe Birds that are afflicted with this Diſeaſe, cannot well digeſt their Meat, but are ſubject to caſt and overturn their Meat in their Stomach, ſo in a ſhort time the Bird conſumes away and dies.</p>
               <p>The third ſort of Diſeaſe is the <hi>Gout,</hi> which is very common to Birds that have been kept long in the Cage, it cauſes a ſore vexing pain in his Feet and Leggs, and cauſes them many times to forſake their Meat, by reaſon they can neither ſtir nor ſtand with any pleaſure, but on the contrary a remaining Pain and vexation. This Diſeaſe is known by much roughneſs in the Leggs and Feet, and ſwellings alſo, which are in the Feet, and Leggs, and Knee, where moſt commonly it troubles them worſt of all.</p>
               <p>The fourth Diſeaſe is <hi>difficulty of Breathing,</hi> or hard and troubleſome drawing of their Breath; and this is known by the Hoarſneſs in their Throats, that they cannot utter the Tunes and Notes with any pleaſure to themſelves or Keepers: for if they do, they do it ſo harſhly and imperfectly, that it is
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:103298:66"/>
as good they were ſilent. And furthermore, if you lay your Hand upon his Breaſt, or diligently mark him as he ſits upon his Pearch, you ſhall eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it by his extraordinary beating, as it were ſhewing himſelf that he is very much troubled with a very great oppreſſion and difficulty of breathing; and if you lay your Hand upon his Breaſt, it ſhall beat againſt your Hand as if he had ſome live-thing in his Body: by all which Symptoms you may juſtly gather and conclude that he is moſt certainly infected with this Diſeaſe oftentimes, eſpecially if it be a high-metled Bird, and he hear another ſing, and is not able to come near him by reaſon of this Diſeaſe: he will caſt forth lamentable noiſes, as if he were ſenſible of his own Diſeaſes. This evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently declareth that he hath this Diſeaſe called <hi>Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> or ſhortneſs of Breath.</p>
               <p>The 5th Diſeaſe ſubject to Singing-Birds is <hi>Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> which oftentimes happens by extraordinary ſinging, each Bird ſtriving to outvie the other in Song. This muſt be quickly helped upon the firſt appearance, or they will never be cured; and this Diſeaſe is at firſt perceived by the trickling of tears from their Eyes, and by certain Feathers that are about their Ears, which immediatly do curl and crook by turning in again.</p>
               <p>The 6th Diſeaſe is the <hi>Falling-Sickneſs,</hi> which is likewiſe incident unto very many Birds, whereof without diligent care &amp; obſervation, theyare ſeldom or never cured; for I could never find any other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for it, but this; To keep the Birds which you bring up, (and eſpecially <hi>Bull-Finches)</hi> from the heat of the Sun all the Summer long, and at the fall of the Leafe cut all the Nails of his Feet to the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:103298:67"/>
very quick, and pull 5, or 6 of his Tail-Feathers, and when he mouts, beſprinkle him with a little White-Wine and Water, and ſet him not in the Sun, but let him dry himſelf all times in the Shade, and give once in a Week ſomething to purge him.</p>
               <p>The 7th Diſeaſe that Birds are ſubject to is the <hi>Pip,</hi> which may be known by the hardneſs of the end of their Tongue, and alſo by the ſides of their Bills: Your ſmall-Birds that feed upon Seeds are very ſeldom ſubject to this Diſeaſe, but moſt commonly your <hi>Throſtles, Black-Birds,</hi> and <hi>Staires,</hi> which feed upon ſoft Meat. I have alſo known your <hi>Nightingales</hi> to be troubled with it, that have been fed too much with Eggs boild hard. For the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of this (for the Bird will never eat his Meat kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor ſing with any Stomach ſo long as he hath it) take the Bird in your Hand, and having opened his Bill with a Needle, take that hardneſs off from the top of his Tongue, and the ſides of his Bill alſo; then give him the Seeds of Mellons, being bruiſed and ſteeped in pure Water, let him drink thereof three or four days; then when you perceive him to grow better, and to take delight to prune and peck himſelf, give him a little fine Loaf-Sugar, and put into his Water alſo. To keep your <hi>Black-Bird</hi> and <hi>Throſtle</hi> from this Diſtemper, give them once in a week a little painted fine-Coloured Snaile, and lay him a Stone in his Cage, and he will break him to peeces and eat him, and this will preſerve thoſe two Birds from having a Fit.</p>
               <p>The 8th is the Diſeaſe of the Rump, which is hard to be known, and no other way that I could ever find to be a better ſign, than the Bird grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Melancholy, as by ſurceaſing and abſtaining
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:103298:67"/>
from ſinging: And the beſt Remedy is, to cut off that ſharp part which lyes upon the top of the Rump, and give him ſome cleanſing thing in his Meat, and refreſhing thing in his Water, and he ſhall find great good by it. This is a grief which all Birds are ſubject to, which are kept in Cages: for if they have their liberty and are abroad, every Bird hath his certain Medicine for every Diſtemper he is ſubject to; for I have obſerved it many times when <hi>Linnets</hi> feed moſt upon Chick-weed and plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-Seeds, that they have come as duely to a Chalk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit every morning, as they have gone to bed at night, and picked Chalk to bind them.</p>
               <p>The laſt Diſeaſe Birds are ſubject to, is the Flux of the Belly, which is known by their making of their Dung thinner and more liquid than ordinary, and by often ſhaking and beating of their Tail, and keeping of it cloſe together. The Remedy is to cut the Feathers of his Tail, and alſo thoſe which are about the Fundament; anointing it with a little Capons-greaſe, and inſtead of Hemp-ſeeds or Rape-Seeds, give him Mellon-Seeds, and Red Beets-Seeds bruiſed for the ſpace of three or four days, till you perceive his Dung altered: And you muſt do this at firſt, otherwiſe it will not help when the bird is waſted and poor. But for thoſe Birds which eat not Seeds, but Sheeps-heart or paſte, give them a very hard roaſted Egg, in ſuch ſort as you have been before directed.</p>

               <head>The ſeveral Diſeaſes which happen to every particular ſort of Bird.</head>
               <p>FIrſt, The Old <hi>Nightingales</hi> that are kept long in a Cage, are very ſubject (if not kept very clean) to the <hi>Gout,</hi> and if their Meat be not chop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped very well, to the Convulſion of the Breaſt, with the Falling-Sickneſs and Giddineſs in their Heads.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Wood-Lark</hi> is very ſubject to be Louſie, and to be Melancholy, and troubled with the ſtraitneſs of the Breaſt, which cauſes them to pine away in a ſhort time if not helped, and then a Flux of the Belly, which if not immediately helped, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes them to nothing.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Skie-Lark</hi> is alſo ſubject to all the ſame In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of the <hi>Wood-lark,</hi> except it be Louſineſs.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Robin</hi> is ſubject to the Cramp, to a great Giddineſs in his Head, and to have the ends of his Nails periſh, if he be not kept clean in his Cage; and will be very ſubject to the Falling-Sickneſs, if it be not prevented.</p>
               <p>Almoſt all your Birds that feed upon Fleſh have almoſt all the ſame Diſtempers, except the <hi>Black-Bird</hi> and <hi>Throſtle,</hi> which ſeldom almoſt die, without it be for want of Meat or Water.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Canary-Bird</hi> hath many Diſeaſes that he is ſubject to, as to the Giddineſs in his Head, Falling-Sickneſs, Convulſion, and Oppreſſion of Stomach and Breaſt, by reaſon of her exceſſive heat; and alſo very ſubject to a Flux in the Belly, which if not timely prevented, cauſes preſent death.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Linnet,</hi> and all other Seed-Birds are ſubject almoſt to the foregoing Diſtempers, but none ſo
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:103298:68"/>
apt to the Falling-Sickneſs as the <hi>Bull-Finch.</hi> I think theſe Rules and Deſcriptions for Diſeaſes are ſufficient for any ordinary underſtanding.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <head>To know how long Birds ſhall live.</head>
               <p>IF any Man be deſirous to know how long theſe Singing-Birds may live, let him underſtand that amongſt Nightingales ſome live but one year, ſome three, ſome five, others unto eight, and till twelve, and ſing very well, rather better and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for the firſt eighth years, but after that they do a little decline by degrees, and from that time forward are not in ſuch a hight of perfection, but decline by little and little: They muſt have very good Maſters and Keepers that do prolong their Lives three or four years; and where one is kept in a Cage till that Age, a hundred die; ſo it's the carefulneſs of the Keeper preſerves the Life of Birds. It hath been known that <hi>Nightingales</hi> have been kept and lived till fifteen years old, and have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſinging little or much for the moſt part of all the years; ſo that you may plainly perceive their Life depends much according to the good or ill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, or elſe according to the good Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Bird.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Wood-Lark</hi> ſeldom lives in a Cage above five years, by reaſon he is a tender Bird, and ſubject to many Caſualties, and we are ignorant of what they eat abroad to preſerve themſelves.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Robin</hi> ſeldom lives above ſeven years, by reaſon he is ſo ſubject to the Falling-ſickneſs, and Cramp, and oppreſſion of the Stomach.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:103298:69"/>
The <hi>Skie-Lark</hi> is a very long-lived Bird, and hardy alſo, and there is not much fear of his Death, if you provide him a Turf once in a Week, and give him Meat and Water plentifully. All ſorts of Seed-Birds live longer than any ſoft-beaked Birds, eſpecially the <hi>Canary</hi> and <hi>Linnet,</hi> ſome having been Maſter of a <hi>Canary</hi> twenty years, and a <hi>Linnet</hi> alſo: But there are Diſeaſes amongſt Birds, as amongſt all ſorts of Cattle, which, if not timely prevented, make a very great ſlaughter.</p>
               <p>Now I have done with all ſorts of Singing-Birds, I ſhall give you ſome ſhort directions about ſome Whiſtling-Birds: And thoſe that have no ſong, that are not worth keeping for ſinging.</p>
               <p>As firſt, The <hi>Sterling,</hi> which is moſt generally kept of all ſorts of people, above any other Birds for whiſtling; and the great fault almoſt in all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is, that they have them too fledg'd out of the Neſt, and that makes them retain ſo much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly of their own harſh notes: Therefore thoſe that do intend to have them rare, and avoid their own ſqueeking notes, take them from the Old ones at two or three days old; do ſo in all Birds that you intend ſhall learn to whiſtle or ſpeak, and learn an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Birds ſong by hanging under him.</p>
               <p>The next is the <hi>Bull-Finch,</hi> which hath no ſong of his own, nor whiſtle neither, but is a very apt Bird to learn if taught by the Mouth.</p>
               <p>The next is a <hi>Black-Bird,</hi> which hath a kind of a rude Whiſtle, and will learn very well, if taken young enough out of the Neſt; for moſt people to ſpare themſelves a little more trouble than ordinary, deſire to have them very fledg'd, and ſo they retain ſo much of the Old Birds Song, that moſt take
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:103298:69"/>
treble the pains they need, and the others have them much better.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Robin Red-breaſt</hi> is an excellent Bird for the Whiſtle, and to ſpeak alſo; but this is the miſery of moſt People, they breed ſo many together, that one ſpoils another: for a <hi>Robin</hi> is a hot-metled Bird, and muſt not be in the hearing of another; therefore if you breed two, have them in ſeveral rooms, that they may not hear each other, and ſo conſequently ſpoil one another.</p>
               <p>The next for whiſtling of Seed-Birds, is your <hi>Canary-Bird,</hi> which will learn any thing almoſt, if taken very young out of the Neſt, otherwiſe not; for he is an exceeding hot-metled Bird, and will run upon his own Song do what you can.</p>
               <p>The next is the <hi>Linnet,</hi> which will learn almoſt any tune if not too long and too much variety; for you muſt not teach any Bird after the <hi>Flaggellet,</hi> or your Mouth, that are too long or too much varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Learn them one tune firſt, and then proceed to another, and keep him dark and ſtill, out of the noiſe of other Birds, for he is very apt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member any Roguery above a Tune. Take this for a general rule for all Birds, that the younger the Birds be, the better they will prove, and anſwer your expectation and trouble for keeping them ten days extraordinary, when they are very young.</p>
               <p>If what I have written be accepted, it may be a further encouragement for me to ſeek out more of the ſecrets of Nature; for of all things that were cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, nothing praiſes and ſets forth the Creator, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Animal Creatures, more than theſe poor
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:103298:70"/>
harmleſs birds. And it is a thing much to be obſerved, that of all the Animal Creatures that ever were made, none can learn, or by any means be taught to ſpeak but the Bird.</p>
