            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ANSWER TO THE POY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SONOVS
SEDICIOVS PAPER OF
Mr. DAVID JENKINS.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>R. <hi>David Jenkins</hi> in his Paper of the 29 of
<hi>April</hi> laſt, laies moſt odious charges upon
the <hi>Parliament:</hi> and conſequently upon all
that have adhered to the <hi>Parliament</hi> in this
Warre; and leaſt theſe his deſperate infuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſhould not worke powerfully enough upon the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar;
he being an ancient practiſer in the Law, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
to the title of a Judge: he cites Book caſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the two Houſes, and ſeemes forward to lay down
his life in the cauſe.</p>
            <p>His 1. Argument runs thus. The <hi>Parliament</hi> not having
the Kings writ, patent or commiſſion, cannot do ſo much
as examine any man: But the <hi>Parliament</hi> has not the
Kings Writ, &amp;c. <hi>Ergo:</hi> his minor is confirmed thus. If
the Kings power remaine ſolely in himſelfe, and be not
vertually preſent in the two Houſes, then they cannot
pretend his Writ, Pattent or Commiſſion. But the
Kings power is in himſelfe, and not vertually in the two
Houſes, <hi>ergo,</hi> that the <hi>Parliament</hi> has no vertuall power,
he prooves thus.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:160224:3"/>
1. If the <hi>Parliament</hi> had in them the Kings vertuall
power, they needed not deſire the Kings ratification:
they needed not ſend any Propoſitions to him; but now
they ſend propoſitions, <hi>ergo,</hi> this vertuall power is but a
meere fiction.</p>
            <p>2. To affirme that the Kings power is ſeperable from
his perſon, is by the Law adjudged high Treaſon: but if
the <hi>Parliament</hi> ſay the Kings power is vertually in them,
then they ſeparate it from his perſon. <hi>Ergo,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. If none can pardon Felony or Treaſon except the
<hi>King,</hi> none has the virtuall power of the <hi>King,</hi> but none
can pardon except the <hi>King. Ergo,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. If the <hi>King</hi> be in no condition to governe, then
he is in no condition to derive virtuall power, but &amp;c.</p>
            <p>5. If none can ſit in <hi>Parliament</hi> but he muſt firſt ſwear
that the <hi>King</hi> is the onely Supreame Gouernour over
all Perſons in all Cauſes, then, no member of the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
nor the whole <hi>Parliament,</hi> can ſuppoſe him or
themſelves ſuperior to the <hi>King.</hi> but none can ſit in <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>Ergo,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. If no Act of <hi>Parliament</hi> binde the ſubject without
the <hi>Kings</hi> aſſent, then there is no vertuall power in the
<hi>Parliament</hi> without the <hi>Kings</hi> aſſent. but no Act bindes
&amp;c. <hi>Ergo,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Out of theſe premiſes which this grave Gentleman
judges to be irrefragable, he concludes that the <hi>Parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</hi>
denyes the <hi>King</hi> to be Supreame Governour, nay to be
any Governour at all, in as much as there is no point of
government, He ſayes but the <hi>Parliament</hi> for ſome years
paſt have taken to themſelves uſing the Kings name, only
to abuſe and deceive the people. He ſaies further, the
<hi>Parliament</hi> pretends againſt the King, becauſe that he
has left the great Counſell, and yet the King deſires to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:160224:3"/>
come to his great Counſell, but cannot becauſe he is by
them kept priſoner at <hi>Holmby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, he ſaies the Houſes are guilty of perjury as
well as of cheating the people and rebelling againſt the
King, in asmuch as at the ſame time they ſweare him to
be only Supreame Governour, and declare him to be in
no condition to governe.</p>
            <p>How eaſily theſe things may be anſwered &amp; refuted
let the world ſee.</p>
            <p>For 1. It cannot be denied; but the <hi>Parliament</hi> ſitts
by the <hi>Kings</hi> Writ, nay if Statute Law be greater then
the <hi>Kings</hi> Writ, it cannot be denied but the <hi>Parliament</hi>
ſits or ought to ſit by ſomething greater then the <hi>Kings</hi>
Writ, And, if it be confeſſed that the <hi>Parliament</hi> ſitts by
the <hi>Kings</hi> Writ, but does not Act by the <hi>Kings</hi> Writ
then it muſt follow that the <hi>Parliament</hi> is a void vaine
Court, and ſitts to no purpoſe, nay it muſt alſo follow,
that the <hi>Parliament</hi> is of leſſe authority and of leſſe uſe
then any other inferior Court. Foraſmuch as it is not in
the <hi>Kings</hi> power to controle other Courts or to prevent
them from ſitting or Acting.</p>
            <p>2. This is a groſſe <hi>non ſequitur</hi> the <hi>Kings</hi> power is in
himſelf, <hi>Ergo</hi> it is not derived to nor does reſide virtually
in the <hi>Parliament.</hi> For the light of the ſun remaines im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodied,
and unexhauſted in the Globe of the ſun, at the
ſame time as it is diffuſed and diſplayed through all the
body of the aire, and who ſees not that the King with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
emptying himſelfe, gives commiſſions daily of Oier
and Terminer to others, which yet he himſelf can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fruſtrate nor elude? but for my part I conceive it is
a great errour to inferre that the <hi>Parliament</hi> has only
the Kings power, becauſe it has the Kings power in it:
for it ſeemes to me that the <hi>Parliament</hi> does both ſit and
act by concurrent power, devolved both fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the King &amp;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:160224:4"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:160224:4"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:160224:5"/>
Kingdome; And this in ſome things is more obvious and
apparent then in others. For by what power does the
<hi>Parliament</hi> grant ſubſedyes to the King? if only by the
power which the King gives, then the King may take
ſubſedies without any grant from the <hi>Parliament:</hi> and if
it be ſo by a power which the people give to the <hi>Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament.</hi>
Then it will follow that the <hi>Parliament</hi> has a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
given both by King and Kingdome.</p>
            <p>3. The ſending propoſitions to the King, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
his concurrence, is ſcarce worth an anſwer, for
Subjects may humbly petition for that which is their
ſtrict right and property. Nay it may ſometimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeme
a ſuperiour to preferre a ſuite to an inferiour for
matters in themſelves due. God himſelf has not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
diſdained to beſeech his own miſerable impious
unworthy creatures: beſides tis not our Tenet that the
King has no power, becauſe he has not all power, nor
that the King cannot at all promote our happineſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he has no juſt claime to procure our ruine.</p>
            <p>4. We affirme not that the Kings power is ſeperated
from his perſon ſo as the two Spenſers affirmed, neither
doe we frame concluſions out of that ſeparation as the
two Spenſers did, either that the King may be remooved
for miſdemenours, or reformed per aſpertee; or that
the Subjects is bound to governe in aid of him; we only
ſay that his power is diſtinguiſhable from his perſon, and
when he himſelfe makes a diſtinction betwixt them
commanding <hi>one</hi> thing by his Legall Writs Courts and
Officers, and commanding another thing extrajudicially
by word of mouth, letters or Miniſters we are to obey
his power rather then his perſon.</p>
            <p>5. We take not from the King all power of pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Delinquents,</hi> we only ſay it is not propper to him
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:160224:5"/>
               <hi>quarto modo.</hi> For if the King pardon him which has
murdered my ſonne, his pardon ſhall not cut me off from
my appeale: and tis more unreaſonable that the Kings
pardon ſhould make a whole State which has ſuffered re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medileſſe,
then any private man. So if the King ſhould
denye indemnity to thoſe which in the fury of war have
done things unjuſtifiable by the Lawes of Peace, and
thereby keep the wounds of the State from being bound
up, tis equitable that an Act of Indemnity ſhould be
made forcible another way. And if this will not hold, yet
this is no good conſequence the King is abſolute in point
of pardons, therefore he is abſolute in all things elſe; and
the <hi>Parliament</hi> has no power to diſcharge <hi>Delinquencyes,</hi>
therefore it has no power in other matters.</p>
            <p>6. The <hi>Parliament</hi> has declared the <hi>King</hi> to be in no
condition to governe: but this muſt not be interpreted
rigidly, and without a diſtinction: for if the <hi>King</hi> with
his ſword drawne in his hand, and purſuing the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
and their adherents as Rebells be not fit for all Acts
of Government, yet tis not hereby inſinuated that he is
diveſted of the habit or right of governing. If he be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified
now he is not unqualified for the future. if he
may not doe things diſtructive to the <hi>Parliament</hi> he is
not barred from returning to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> or doeing
juſtice to the <hi>Parliament.</hi> This is a frivelous cavill, and
ſubterfuge.</p>
            <p>7. We ſwear that the <hi>King</hi> is our ſupreame Governor
over all Perſons and in all cauſes; but we doe not ſwear
that he is above all law nor above the ſafty of his people
which is the end of the law and indeed <hi>Paramount</hi> to the
law it ſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If he be above all law, or liable to no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint
of our law, then we are no freer then the French
or the Turcks and if he be above the prime end of law
<hi>common ſafty.</hi> Then we are not ſo free as the French or
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:160224:6"/>
the Turks. For if the totall ſubverſion of the French or
the Turke were attempted: they might by Gods law im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed
in the booke of nature juſtifie a ſelf-defence; but
we muſt remedileſly periſh when the <hi>King</hi> pleaſes to
command our throats. Beſides, how acheived the <hi>King</hi> of
England ſuch a Supreamacy above all law and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
it ſelfe, for whoſe behoofe law was made? if
Gods donation be pleaded, which is not ſpeciall to him
or different from what other <hi>Kings</hi> may pretend too, then
to what purpoſe ſerue our lawes, nay to what purpoſe
ſerve the lawes of other Countryes, for by this generall
donation, all nations are condemned to all ſervitude
as well as we. If the Law of this Land bee appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to, what Books has Mr. <hi>Jenkins</hi> read, where
has he found out that <hi>Lex Regia</hi> whereby the people of
England have given away from themſelves all right in
themſelves? Some of our books tell us that we are more
free then the French, that the <hi>King</hi> cannot oppreſſe us in
our perſons, or eſtates, by impriſonment denying
juſtice, or laying taxes without our conſents: other books
tell us that the ſafety of the people is the ſupreame law,
and that the <hi>King</hi> has both God &amp; the Law for his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior.
but all this is nothing to learned Mr. <hi>Jenkins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. We admit that no Acts of <hi>Parliament</hi> are compleat
or formally binding with out the <hi>Kings</hi> aſſent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet this is
ſtill to be denyed that therefore without this aſſent parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
