            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>HUMBLY SHEWETH,</opener>
            <p>THat upon the firſt report of your being invited to that Supream truſt, from which you were illegal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
interrupted, we were ſurprized with joy in the hopes of our approaching deliverance: and
beholding your Declaration manifeſting your reſolution (in the ſtrength of God) to endeavour
the ſettlement of this Commonwealth upon ſuch a foundation, as may aſſert, eſtabliſh, and ſecure the
Liberties of the people, both as men and Chriſtians; Your Petitioners are filled with hope, that
a price being once more put into your hands, you will endeavour to compleat and perfect what you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared;
that the ſincerity of your engagements may be made conſpicuous in the eye of the world, by the
reality of your righteous Actions. And although we cannot omit to expreſſe the fears in ſome, of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe,
by the continuance of many in places of truſt, who in <hi>April</hi> 1659. laboured not onely to make the
Name of a Commonwealth odious, but to plunge us into a more dangerous gulf of Tyranny and ſlavery
then we were in in 1640. yet we are rather perſwaded, that the God of Heaven, after his long chaſtiſement
both of you and us (who hath made the Mountain of Monarchy become a Plain, by reſtoring you to your
intruſted Rights) will carry you on to accompliſh greater things then hitherto our eyes have ſeen: That the
preſent Age may joyfully conclude your laſt Works to be more glorious then the former, and future Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
triumphantly ſing, <hi>Many Parliaments have done worthily, but you have excelled them all.</hi>
            </p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Wherefore we take boldneſſe humbly to offer at preſent to your Grave and ſerious Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
Theſe few particulars following.</head>
               <p>1. That for the future ſettling of this Nation, upon the firm Baſis of a free Commonwealth, you would
be pleaſed to make ſuch proviſion for ſecuring of the Government, as that no uſurping ſpirit might be able
to bring us back to Monarchy, nor introduce Oligarchy upon us; and that the future Elections may be ſo ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled,
that the good people may be freed from fears of the Old Enemies and Neuters getting up to Lord
it over us, by putting ſuch qualifications on the Electors and Elected, as may not give up our dear-bought
Freedome, and as may appear juſt in the ſight of all.</p>
               <p>2. That for the prevention of forraign Invaſions, and domeſtick broyls, the <hi>Militia</hi> of this County, and
other parts of the Commonwealth, may be timely ſettled in the hands of faithfull men, that have in theſe
trying times been ſtedfaſt to the Intereſt thereof.</p>
               <p>3. That all which profeſſe faith in Jeſus Chriſt, and live peaceably in godlineſs and honeſty, though
different in apprehenſion in matters of Faith and Worſhip, may be equally protected and incouraged; and
that the vexatious and intolerable burthen of Tithes may be taken away, and no other forced maintainance
impoſed on the tender Conſciences of ſuch as maintain their own Miniſters.</p>
               <p>4. That all ſuch faithful perſons that have been illegally removed from places of truſt Military or Civil,
or have quitted their imployments for Conſcience-ſake, and faithfulneſſe to this Common-wealth, may be
invited and reſtored to their former capacities.</p>
               <p>5. That the miſchievous Inconveniences, Irregularities, Delayes, and Chargeableneſs of the Law may be
rectified, by diſtribution of Juſtice to the People in their ſeverall Counties; and that the great cheats in
Sales and Mortgages may be prevented, by ſettling of Regiſters in each County.</p>
               <p>6. That you would be mindfull for the quickning of Trade ſo much decayed, principally that of Clothing,
which greatly concerns this County; the fail whereof hath greatly impoveriſhed and ruinated many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.</p>
               <p>In the Proſecution of which, we ſhall, with the utmoſt hazard of our lives and eſtates, ſtand by you againſt
all oppoſers, and with hearts bowed down to the Father of ſpirits implore ſtrength for you.</p>
