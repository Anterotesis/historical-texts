            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

repaired a tall young man of a commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable

demaunded the price, he aſked the Chaundler if hée would buye a
good bargaine of Nutmegges and other wares? ſaying hée was

into arrorages, with his Ghoaſt where he ſoiurned, was
conſtrained to ſell all his merchandize or at leaſt ſome of them to
diſcharge his lodging: the Chaundler ready (as all worldlings
are) to get: After certaine ſpéeches of bargaining, they grewe to
a compoſition and abſolute bargaine, and therupon this halter
catcher deſired the Chamdler to take a bagge or two with him,
to put in the commodities for the eaſier carriage, and alſo to put
ſixtéene ſhillings in his purſſe to pay the hoaſt if he would not let
the wares to paſſe (for ſo much hée ſaid he was runne on the ſcore)

and going foorth, this notorious couſener leads the boy into <hi>Saint

againe to the boy ſaying that the chaundler was ſo buſie that hée
would not come to him but deſired that he would ſend it him in,
willing him to ſtay and carry a bagge of nutmegges home with

whoſe conſent the maid ſcrupuouſly would not be obtained.</p>
                  <p>Many ſutes and intreaties being made but to ſmall effect, the
young man abſented him ſelf from his loue ſome ſpace of time and
after the wooing manner courted an other mayde in the towne,
in ſuch ſorte that the common brute went he ſhould marry with
the latter. Wheruppon méeting his former looue in <hi>Iſlington</hi>

God giue him ioy for ſhée heard ſay that hée ſhould be aſked in the

<pb facs="tcp:9569:13"/>
but that you will forbid the banes, with that he tooke an
othe forthwith, raſhly you may be bolde to ſay, as commonly in
ſuch cauſes women are, to prooue that of her faith and troth ſhée
would not forbid the banes.</p>
                  <p>They departed each from other, the man ſtraight waies to the

that Sunday béeing at the Church not knowing of it, till o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

was aſked. The matter examined, hee tolde the father of the
maide, what promiſe his daughter had made, that if he were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
in the Church, ſhée would not forbid the banes, therfore hée
thought good to be aſked to her whome ſo long he had wooed and
looued.</p>
                  <p>Now the Parents ſeing the matter had gon ſo far, gaue their

who hauing got copper rings, and other ſuch like when they méet
ſuch whome they think they may beguile, they will goe is them

for a ſmall price.</p>
                  <p>The buyer thinking it to be golde, giues him for it thriſe

               <p>In the yeare 1588, was a widdow named <hi>Margaret Owen,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:9569:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
aged thréeſcore yeares who had an horne foure inches long moſte
miraculouſly growing out of her forehed downe to her noſe, and
there crooked towardes her right eye, and was then growing ſo
faſt that ſhée was faine to cut it, leaſt it ſhould blemiſh her ſight.</p>
               <p>The woman was to be ſéene aſwell in London as in other pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces
of this Realme, neither can any naturall cauſe bee knowen
thereof, but a wounder that God hath ſent.</p>
               <p>Many are the reportes, but whether they be true or no I leaue
to your iudgments: for ſome affirme that in her youth ſhée was
not ſo loyall to her huſband as dutie ought, and that diuers times
there hath béene ſpéeches tending to that purpoſe betwéene her
huſband and her, wherupon hée ſuſpſcting flying fame to be true,
that ſhée was light of behauiour. &amp; charging her with it in theſe
tearmes, that ſhe had giuen him the horne, it is ſaid, that ſhée not
only denyed it, but wiſhed of God that if ſhee had giuen her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
the horne, that ſhée might haue one horne growing out of
her owne forehead as a witneſſe againſt her to the wounder of the
world: (God only knoweth whether it were ſo or not) if it were, I
counſaile all other aſwell men as women to looke to them ſelues
and not to commit ſinne vpon ſinne: firſt, in committing ſuch an
horrible offence and adultrie: and ſecondly to cloake the ſame, to
call vengeance on their heds. Remember the woman that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſware

               <p>The wife being deliuered and each thing (as in ſuch cauſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth)

               <p>A yeare or two after about the yeare 1580 which is not long
ſince that it may be forgoten, or fained as a lie, it pleaſed God to
ſend his wife to be with childe againe, and to be deliuered of a
monſter, a male according to his deſier, hauing the ſhape of two
Children, from the ſhoulders vpward it had two heads, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

ſuddainly both his féete were taken from him by reaſon
wherof, he fell on a plaine pauement of frée ſtone in his owne

that ſhée would ſet a Bée in his tayle the next time. Yea and that

would ſtrike her on the breſt but ſhe required them not
to doe ſo: And when ſhe was executed ſuch a ſtincking vapour
iſſued foorth of her mouth that the behoulders were ſcantlye able

                  <p>Not far from <hi>Lincolne</hi> at a towne called <hi>Bourne</hi> were thrée
bretheren whereof one was a countrey mercer who had maryed a
