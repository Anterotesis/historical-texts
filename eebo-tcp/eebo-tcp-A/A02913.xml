            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Wel I prove that I have affirmed, thus: Firſt Heb. 11.6. Without faith it is vnpoſſible to pleaſe God, and Rom. 14.23. Whatſoever is not of faith is ſin. Theſe two Scriptures prove moſt evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly that whatſoever I have not faith in inworſhiping God although it were vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly true, I may not offer it vp vnto God, for it is diſpleaſing to him, and it is ſin againſt him: as alſo it appeareth plainely by him, that came into the Kings ſupper and wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted his wedding garment.

               <p>The intent of the Kings law is not ſo, as appeareth both by the ſtatute for the oath of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, and alſo by his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi>. owne words, manifeſted in his Apologie for the oath of alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, as hereafter is more fullie declared.

               <p>It is not ſo, you regard not whether I have faith or no, for if you did, you would not vrge the Kings law againſt me, which is but a carnal weapon, and cannot beger faith, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d there fore is no ſure ground of faith. For in my obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God I muſt not <hi>preſume above that that is written.</hi> 1. Cor. 4.6. For <hi>the VVord of God</hi> is the onely ground of faith Rom. 10.17. and therefore if you would have me come of faith, you would onely vrge the law of the King of Kings againſt mee.</p>

               <p>Yes you hold either that they cannot err, or if they do err, I muſt obey them, for if I do not obey them you threaten me puniſhment.</p>

               <p>Then this is your argument: The lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned do not err, and therefore muſt be obeyed.

The learned do not err, and therefore muſt be obeyed. The Pope and the reſt of that rancke are learned, (yea as learned as yours) a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d do not err, and therefore they muſt be obeyed. The one is as true as the other, but both abhominable. If you prove that they that want this learning, muſt not meddle with the waies of God, but as theſe learned men teach them, then indeed you ſaid ſome thinge, but if you cannot, as moſt certen it is, you cannot. For the word of God is againſt you herein, then for ſhame to God and Me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, leave of your cruell per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting, for why do you perſecute Men that cannot of faith ſubmit to your direction concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the waies of God, vpon which conſiſteth their ſalvation if they walke in the true way of faith with love thereof, and their condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion if they walke in by path.</p>

               <p>Yes, Chriſt alone is King of Iſraell, that ſits vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Davids throne, and therefore mark the true proportion. In the time of the old Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the Kings of Iſraell had power from God to compel all to the ordinances of God, or to cut them of by their ſword from the earthly Land of Canaan, and the promiſſes thereof: So in the new Teſtament the King of Iſrael Chriſt Ieſus hath power from the Father to compell all, to the ordinances of God, or to cut them of by his ſword, from the Heavenly Land of Canaan and the promiſſes thereof: The Kings of Iſrael one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had this power vnder the law, and the King of Iſraell onely hath this power vnder the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell: And therefore whoſoever will challenge this power vnder the goſpel, he muſt be the king of Iſrael in the time of the goſpell, which is par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ticulier onely to Ieſus Chriſt, vnto whome all power in Heaven and in Earth is given.</p>
               <p>And let it be here well obſerved, that by this opinion of yours you make the Kingdome and ordinances of Iſrael vnder the Law, and the Kingdome and ordinances of Iſraell vnder the goſpell allone, directly contrary to the whole Scripture, for the Kingdome and ordinances of Iſraell vnder the lawe were of this world, but the Kingdome and ordinances of Iſraell vnder the goſpell are not of this world, as Chriſt the King thereof himſelf teſtifieth Iohn. 28.

               <p>For the ſatiſfaction of al conſciences herein that it may appeare playnly, not to be gainſaid, let vs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider the words of wiſedome, ſet downe in order as they lye. And firſt: what is ment by worſhip. 2ly: what by the Beaſt. 3ly. what his jmage is. 4ly. what his marke is: a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d laſtly what is ment by forehead or hand.</p>
               <p>And firſt for worſhip, it is plentifully manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in the ſcriptures, that it is ſervice, ſubjectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or obedience, to ſuch thinges as are comaunded by God, or others: as Mat. 4.10. Exo 20.5. dewt 13.4. and therefore his ſerva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts wee are whome wee obey. Rom. 6.16. and as the lord ſaith: Iff I be your maiſter, where is my feare? if a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther where is myne honor or worſhip Mal. 1.6 2ly: by Beaſt, the ſcripture ſpeaketh ſometimes of cruel men in power and authority, as Dan. 7.17. Luk. 13.31.32.2. Tim. 4.17. Sometimes of a blaſphemous ſpiritual power exerciſed by men, received off the Dragon exalting it ſelfe above God, makeing war with the Saints, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming them, and that hath power over every kindred, and tongue, and Nation, ſo that al that dwell
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:17890:28"/>
vpon the Earth worſhip him. etc. And this is the Beaſt here ſpoken of, even that ſpirituall power or juriſdiction of Rome: which firſt wrought in a miſtery, and by degrees was exal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted, till at the laſt it was exalted to this cruell Beaſt diſcribed. Revel. 13.1. etc. Which Beaſt openeth his moueth to bla<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>phemy againſt <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>od, ſaying and practizing, that the comaundements that God hath given for his ſervice, are not to bee regarded, but in ſteed thereof ſetteth, vp co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds of his owne, vnto the which whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will not bee ſubject, excommunication and all crueltie even to death will enſue, yea even with Gunpowder err it faile, and for this his crueltie he is called a Beaſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly: by Image is ment any forme, ſhape ſimilitude, or reſemblance of the thinge ſpoken of, as Deut. 4.15.16. etc. Exo. 20 4 ſo that where ſoever ſuch a ſpirituall power is, as this aboue diſcribed, there is the Beaſts Image, <hi>as in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the like power or Beaſt to the firſt, is not to bee found vnder the Heavens, in exaltation and cruelty.</p>
               <p>Fourthly: by marke, is ment profeſſion or practice, whereby wee are knowne from others as Mat. 7.20. 1. Iohn. 2 2 Iohn. 13.35. As bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges or markes do put difference, betwixt this Mans and that Mans, in Cattel or ſervants, as by ſuch a mans marke wee knowe theſe are his ſheepe, and by ſuch a Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s badg. wee knowe this man belongeth to ſuch a great man: ſo they are ſaid to have put on Chriſt, that have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his baptiſme. Gal. 3.27. even as a ſervant is knowne by putting on his libery.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:17890:28"/>Laſtly, forehead or hand, the holy Ghoſt vſeth that phraiſe from the Old Teſtament, where Gods people were commaunded, not onely to lay vp his Commaunds in their harts and in their ſoules, but to bind them for a ſigne vpon their hands. that they might bee as frontiers betweene their eyes. Dewt. 11.18. and 6.6.8. The wyſedome of God therein teaching, that the forehead and ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d are the apparanteſt parts of the body, to the view of all Men: ſo that to receive the marke in the forehead or hand, is to make manifeſt profeſſion of him wee obey. The ſome of all which is, that whoſoever openly pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>feſſeth obedience, and ſubjection, to that Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall cruell power off Rome, <hi>The Beaſt,</hi> or to that Spirituall cruell power off England, <hi>his Image,</hi> (whereſoever they or eyther of them are exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) ſuch a one, and ſuch perſons <hi>shall drinke off the wine off Gods wrath, and bee tormented in fire and brimſtone, and shall have no reſt day nor night for evermore.</hi>

               <p>True it is, that religion ſtandeth not onely in outward thinges, for God requireth the hart: and truth in the inward parts, but that God requireth not our ſubjection (vpon feareful pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments) to thoſe outward ordinances which he requireth, is a doctrine of devils as I ſhall prove.</p>
               <p>And firſt, for the outward ordinances off the old Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which were meerly ſhadowes, &amp; now <hi>are beggerly rudiments</hi> Gal. 4.16. what indi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gnation the lord had towards them that tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed.

               <p>I bleſſe God I have learned of thApoſtle 2. Cor. 13.8.

               <p>It cannot be denyed / but that the miniſters preach ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny excellent truths / and do bring people to much reformation in many thinges.</p>

               <p>True it cannot be denyed. For if the devil ſhould come in his owne likenes, men would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt him, but becauſe he tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſformeth himſelfe into an Angel of light, therefore he deceiveth. So his miniſters, if they ſhould teach al lyes, me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would not be deceived by them, nor plead for them, but becauſe they teach many truths people receive them. but firſt: for whatſoever they teach, they neither could nor ſhould teach publiquely, their moueths ſhould be ſtopped, if they received not that their power to teach ſuch truths fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe the Dragon ſends, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d therefore none ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> receive thoſe truths from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but they receive the devil by whoſe power they teach for as our Saviour ſaith <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.40. <hi>He that receiveth you, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth me, and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that ſent me.</hi> So he that receiveth thoſe the Beaſt ſends, receiveth the Beaſt and he that re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceiveth the Beaſt, receiveth him that ſent him, that is the devil. Further did not that South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayer Balaam, teach excellent truths? Num. 23.24. Chap. Yea the Southſayers of th Philiſtines the like. 1. Sam. 6. Yea thoſe in the Goſpell
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:17890:31"/>
preach in Chriſts name. Mat. 7.22, as many we teſtimonies might be manifeſted, and ſecondly. For their bringing off people to reformation, and therein doeing great workes, did not the Southſayers before recited. 1. Sam. 6. ſhewe the Princes their ſin, in deteyninge Gods Arke and the judgments againſt them for the ſame, exhorting them to ſend it away, and not to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den their harts, as Pharaoh and the Egiptians hardned their harts? and was not reformation wrought hereby? a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d did not they that preached in Chriſts name caſt out Devils, and do many and great workes? of whome our Saviour teſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fieth, he never acknowledged them. But let vs a litle conſider wherein the reformation con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſiſteth, procured by their preachinge, in drunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennes, whoredome, ſwearing. etc. Moral due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which thinges whoſoever is not reformed in, ſhal never ſee Gods Kingdome, yet which thinges many of the Philoſophers (that knewe not God) abounded in, as they that knowe the ſtories cannot deny.</p>
               <p>But do they teach their hearers to hate vaine inventions and love Gods Law? in a generall manner of teathing they may, but iff it come to particular practice, you ſhal ſee what they will do: do they teach any to ſubmit to that one law giver Chriſt Ieſus, for the guydance of his Church, and not to Antichriſts abhominations, no they will tell you, you muſt ſigh and groane, till the Magiſtrate will reforme: for you are a private perſon, and muſt bee ſubject: and iff the powerfull working off Gods word and Spirit prevaile in you, to let you ſee, that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrats not reforminge, wil not excuſe you at the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:17890:31"/>
day off account, but that, that ſoule that comit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth abhomination ſhall dye, and that rather then you will Worſhip the Beaſt or his Image, you will ſuffer with Chriſt peaceably ſeperating your ſelfe from ſuch ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prophanatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as neither can, nor willbe reformed, endevouring to ſquare your ſelfe both in your entrance, and walking in Chriſts way, vnto that golden read, which he hath left for direction: then the beſt off all theſe preachers and reformers, willbe hot and bitter, laboring with al the turning of devices to turne you, and with hold you from reformation: And iff they cannot prevaile hereby, then publiſh you in their previleged pulpits, where none may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere them: You are a ſchiſmatique, Browniſt. Annabaptiſt and what not, to make the multy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude abhor your doeings, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not to followe you therein, and ſome of them (iff not all) vnder a cullor, procure your impriſonment, and trouble, by their Canonized lords, or ſome off their Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Purſevants.

            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>No I never heard it affirmed, but as deep as he.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Well, out of your own ground you ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:17890:40"/>
convinced. Did God ever purpoſe or declare, that Adam for that tranſgreſſion ſhould goe to hell? conſider it well before you anſwer.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>No, for from eternitie he purpoſed that Chriſt ſhould be betwixt that ſyn, and condemnation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>You ſay true: then for that ſin, God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver purpoſed to condemne Adam to hell: if not him for that, why any of his poſteritie for that? Let this be conſidered, it is your owne ground. Further I ſay, and that without contradictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it was never Gods purpoſe that any ſhould go to hell, but for refuſing Chriſt. This is conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation that light (or Chriſt) is come into the world / and men love darknes better. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.19. and Chriſt will condemne the world of ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they beleeve not in him. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.9.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot contradict you in this, I will better co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>If you conceive the former, you may ſee what I hold, namely that before all beginings, it was Gods purpoſe or predeſtination that, ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould conſiſt in the receiving, or beleeving in Chriſt, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in refuſing of Chriſt. <hi>He that will not beleeve ſhalbe damned.

            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>Then you hold that God hath predeſtinated ſome to be ſaved, and ſome to be damned.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, as I told you, namely the receivers of Chriſt to be ſaved: and the refuſers of Chriſt to be damned, but that God hath predeſtinate
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:17890:41"/>
or appointed ſome to the meanes &amp; end, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be wicked and to be damned, is the moſt blaſphemous conceit, that ever Sathan foyſts into mans hart, or braine.</p>
