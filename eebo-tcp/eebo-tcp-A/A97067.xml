         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to a Private Port or <hi>Sinus</hi> (a Friends Boſome) yet paſſes the Ocean to arrive at it: your Lordſhips Name enforms me Whence it is, and withall promiſes a Rich Fraught; which the Bill of Lading tells me What it is, <hi>The Nature of Truth;</hi> and blame me not if I were ambitious to ſee it, that I might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore it: If, by miſchance, I be entangled, I hope your Lordſhips hand will help me to get cleare. Our firſt fathers, which had never ſeene Fire before, while every one was catching at that which ſhone ſo Bright, no marvell if he that firſt med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled with it, Burnt his Fingers: The Beauty of Truth is likewiſe Bright and Glorious; ſo Glorious, that ſome have found her <hi>Dazle their Eyes,</hi> (he might have ſaid, Others have Burnt their Fingers, And I, perhaps, am one of them.)

            </p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip, ſometimes, in this <hi>Divine Treatiſe,</hi> for fear of Dazling our Eyes, hath left us in a Want of Light. <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Truth,</hi> which your Lordſhip had the happineſſe to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, is propoſed to us Cloathed, and Guilded (rather then Painted) in a moſt curious Dreſſe indeed, yet ſuch as hides the Body; the Beauty whereof being ſo well worth behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we had rather have ſeene her (as your Lordſhip did)

For what the Orator uſeth to Illuſtrate, that the Philoſopher finds to Obſcure.</p>
            <p>And thus much perhaps, if no more, may be gained by the enſuing diſcourſe, that your Lordſhip taking occaſion from thence, may afford more Light to that which divers deſire better to underſtand, and Vnmask ſo Faire a Face. (At leaſt thoſe who have once ſeene her Naked, may take the paines to Vndreſſe her.) And perhaps having taken a ſecond view, through this a more thick Perſpective of not ſo <hi>high raiſed a Fancy,</hi> may give us a more Diſtinct Delineation of what its owne Dazling Brightneſſe preſented at firſt more confuſed.</p>
            <p>I hope I ſhall need no large Apology to obtaine Acceptance, at leaſt a Pardon from ſo Noble a Lord, (<hi>to whom,</hi> I am told, <hi>nothing can be more gratefull, and who promiſeth the faireſt anſwer,</hi>) if I Accept the Challenge: which it's like your Lordſhip would Performe, (if at leaſt Encounters of another nature would give way to thoſe of the Penne.) If I be demanded therefore of what I doe, Why at all? I reply, Becauſe, in your Lordſhips name, invited: If why ſo late?

I have nothing to reply but this, <hi>Qui ſerò dat, diu noluit.</hi> What was at firſt, in a few dayes, written to a private Friend, having lien ſo long in your Lordſhips hands, is a ſufficient teſtimony that I made no haſte to publiſh it.</p>

               <p>Accordingly, one making a Promiſe with intention to perform it, yet afterward breaks it; this Promiſe is <hi>Morally</hi> true, becauſe it is a true repreſentation of his Intentions; but it is not <hi>Logically</hi> true, as not being a repreſentation of his future Actions.

               <p>The firſt of theſe he begins with, proving it to be the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding in its Eſſence:</hi> (The ſecond he proceeds to in the tenth Chapter.)

               <p>If you take <hi>Truth</hi> in any other acceptation beſide that laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, I ſee not how the Argument will hold: For if you take it either for the Truth of <hi>Being,</hi> or the Truth of <hi>Knowing</hi> (in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon acceptation;) for that Eſſence, whereby every Creature both <hi>is</hi> and may be <hi>known</hi> to be: It may be granted, that the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is one of thoſe <hi>Rays of the Divine Nature,</hi> ſomewhat of that Excellency implanted in Man, of that Image of God whereby Man is <hi>conformed to the likeneſſe of the Creator:</hi> It will be granted alſo, That the <hi>Eſſence</hi> or <hi>Truth</hi> of every Creature, whereby it Is or is Known to be, is a Ray proceeding from the ſame Center, (though to another point of the Circumference,) a Stream iſſuing forth from the ſame Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of Being; and carryes ſome weak Reſemblance, <hi>ſome Sparkling of that Primitive Light,</hi> or Truth, that <hi>Originall</hi> Eſſence which is in God; (For thus every Creature hath ſomthing of God in it, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fert quaelibet herba Deum.</hi>) Yet will it not follow from hence, That this communicated Ray of Being is the ſame with the Underſtanding. For the Argument will prove erroneous, as being Affirmative in the ſecond Figure, in which no Affirmative Propoſition can be concluded: And the Conſequence will be the ſame with this, [What is the Body of Man but a materiall ſubſtance? And is not a Stone the ſame?] Which you would hardly admit as a ſufficient argument to prove our Body to be a Stone.</p>
               <p>If you take <hi>Truth</hi> for <hi>Reaſon,</hi> the Argument will admit of a reducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into an exact Form, thus, [That <hi>Ray of the Divine Nature,</hi> which doth (ſolely, or principally) expreſſe Gods Image in Man, is the <hi>

               <p>But you will ſay ſtill, However Reaſon may thus dignifie and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh it from Irrationall Beings; Yet this is but an <hi>Accidentall</hi> Dignity, an <hi>Accidentall</hi> Diſtinction, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But fifthly, (which I conceive to be of the greateſt force) though Reaſon, or the Underſtanding (as a Faculty) be only <hi>Eſſentiale Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequens<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

(It is a hard thing,</hi> by his own confeſſion, <hi>to find out the Form of any Being, much more to diſcover the Being of a Form,</hi> pag. 32.) Tell me the Being of Any thing, and I will tell you the Being of This. If I ask <hi>What</hi> the <hi>Soule</hi> is? (which <hi>to be</hi> we are ſure:) You will ſay perhaps, <hi>a Spirituall Subſtance:</hi> And that is all you can ſay, for the Eſſence of it. But if I ask, what it is To be <hi>Spirituall?</hi> what, To be a <hi>Subſtance?</hi> I ſuppoſe you cannot tell me otherwiſe, then by <hi>Negations,</hi> or <hi>Effects.</hi> And (thus) they will do in the <hi>Elementall Forms;</hi> They are not theſe Qualities, but ſomething from whence they ariſe. (And ſo for the ſubſtance of the Soule, It is not theſe Faculties but the Originall of them.)</p>
               <p>If you will ſay, There is no ſuch <hi>Something,</hi> as this ſubſtantiall <hi>Form</hi> of the Elements; becauſe we cannot tell you <hi>what</hi> this <hi>Something</hi> is.</p>
               <p>(To omit, that by the ſame reaſon you might baniſh all Being, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe none can tell you, what <hi>Being</hi> is: For if you ſay (and that is all you can ſay) that Being is a Ray communicated from the Originall Entity in God: This tells us at the moſt, but <hi>whence</hi> it is, not <hi>what</hi> it is.)</p>
               <p>I ſay, If you deny, that there be any other <hi>Forms</hi> of the Elements (beſide their <hi>Qualities</hi>) whereby they differ one from another; Then need we look no further: For then theſe <hi>Faculties,</hi> though but <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi> may be ſufficient to make an <hi>Eſſentiall</hi> difference in the Rationall Soule from the Irrationall.</p>
               <p>But further, If you can perſwade them, that the <hi>Eſſence</hi> or <hi>Form</hi> of the Elements, and their <hi>Accidents</hi> or <hi>Prime Qualities,</hi> are the <hi>ſame:</hi> I doubt not, but then they will as eaſily grant, the <hi>Soul</hi> and its <hi>Faculties</hi> to be the <hi>ſame</hi> alſo.</p>

                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:130470:17"/>And thus I have anſwered according to their opinion that hold the Soul and its Faculties diſtinct: And have ſhewed, that we are not ſo farre to ſeek for a Recipient of Reaſon, or Truth, as his Lordſhip might imagine. And indeed there is nothing more difficult in this particular, then in all Accidents whatſoever; their <hi>Subject</hi> is their <hi>Recipient,</hi> and ſo is the Subject of Truth, or Reaſon, Its Recipient.</p>
               <p>But there is another kind of <hi>Recipiency</hi> (which I ſhall touch in the next Chapter) which (if I miſtake not) will cut the ſinews of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and leave it of no force.</p>
               <p>But in the mean time (having found a <hi>Recipient</hi>) we muſt ſeek for a <hi>Fountaine,</hi> from whence this Light of Reaſon, or Truth, is derived. For that is his Lordſhips next demand; <hi>Who is it that communicateth this Light?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the anſwering of this, I ſhall firſt propound another <hi>Qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I ask therefore firſt, whether <hi>Fire</hi> (ſuppoſing it to be an Element) be not the true <hi>Recipient</hi> of <hi>Heat?</hi> and the <hi>Loadſtone</hi> the true <hi>Recipient</hi> of the <hi>Attractive virtue</hi> that is in it? and the <hi>Sunne,</hi> the true Recipient of <hi>Light?</hi> If ſo, then I demand, From whence they are received? What is the Fountain from which they are communicated?</p>
               <p>If you ſpeak of an <hi>Internall</hi> Fountain, from whence they flow by an <hi>Eſſentiall Emanation;</hi> The <hi>Recipient</hi> and the <hi>Fountain</hi> will be the <hi>ſame.</hi> And ſo, if you ſay the <hi>Body</hi> of the Sunne, of the Fire, of the Loadſtone, be the immediate <hi>Recipients</hi> of their Light, Heat, and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; Then muſt I ſay, That theſe ſeverall <hi>Bodies</hi> are the ſeverall <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> from whence (reſpectively) thoſe Qualities do proceed. If you ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And the Definitive Reſolution of this <hi>Quare</hi> depends upon the determination of that Queſtion in Philoſophy, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Accidents</hi> be <hi>ſubjected</hi> immediately in the <hi>Form,</hi> or in the <hi>Comp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Which queſtions it is not materiall for me to determine; for take which ſide you pleaſe, I ſhall ſoon finde both the Fountain and a Recipient.</p>
               <p>If you look for an <hi>Externall, Phyſicall</hi> Fountain, or Efficient; we muſt ſay, That the ſame Fountain from whence they have their <hi>Eſſence,</hi> from the ſame do they receive with their Eſſence their <hi>Inſeparable Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents,</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:130470:17"/>
or <hi>Eſſentiall Conſequents,</hi> by a <hi>Comproduction.</hi> Thus the Sunne received its inherent Light by Creation, together with its Eſſence, from God: For in the Creation of the Subſtance, the Accidents are alſo Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created. So Fire produced by a naturall Agent, receives its Heat com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>produced, or congenerated, and conferred upon it together with its Eſſence from the ſame Efficient.</p>
               <p>Now in any of theſe ways, it will not be hard to find a <hi>Fountain</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> an Originall from whence the Light of <hi>Reaſon</hi> or <hi>Truth</hi> may be conferred; Though we hold the Underſtanding and the Soule to be diſtinct.</p>
               <p>If you ask an <hi>Internall</hi> Fountain; It will be anſwered, That <hi>Reaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> or the Faculty of Underſtanding, flows from the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of the Soule, as an <hi>Eſſentiall Conſequent;</hi> and is received and inherent <hi>in</hi> the <hi>Soule<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> (For I think not fitting to ſay, that it is inherent in the whole Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Creature (jointly) conſiſting of Body and Soule; becauſe it remains in the Soule ſeparate, without the Body.) Or (if you look at them as Three things) then <hi>Reaſon</hi> muſt be ſaid to flow from the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,</hi> and It from the <hi>Soule;</hi> and to be received, by Inherence, <hi>in</hi> the Underſtanding, as That alſo is received in the Soule.</p>
               <p>If you enquire for an <hi>Externall</hi> Efficient; So the Faculties are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Concreated with the Soule by God; or elſe comproduced by the Parents by Propagation. And ſo we want not a <hi>Fountain,</hi> from whence Reaſon may be communicated.</p>
               <p>I proceed to his Lordſhips proſecution of this <hi>Quaere. This Light</hi> (of Truth or Reaſon) <hi>muſt be conveyed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, from the Soule, from ſome other Creature, or from God himſelfe;</hi> but neither of theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ways; therefore not all.</p>
               <p>I ſee not why Any or All of theſe Fountains may not be admitted to be the Source of Reaſon, in a ſeverall way.</p>
               <p>Firſt, why may not the <hi>Soule</hi> be the Fountain of <hi>Reaſon</hi> or the <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Faculty;</hi> as well as the Eſſence of Fire is the Fountain of its Heat, and the Eſſence of the Magnet the Fountain of its Virtue? not by <hi>Phyſicall Production,</hi> but by <hi>Eſſentiall Emanation?</hi> Indeed, I like not to ſay, The Soule communicates Reaſon to the Underſtanding, (as to a Third thing;) For I have ſaid before, the Recipient and the Fountain in this way of conveyance, <hi>viz. per emanation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But I ſay, That <hi>Reaſon</hi> or the underſtanding Faculty, which the Soule as <hi>Recipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> entertains <hi>In it ſelfe;</hi> it hath alſo <hi>From itſelf,</hi> as being the <hi>Fountain.</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:130470:18"/>
(But if you take the Underſtanding as a third thing from both; then the Soul muſt not be ſaid to be the <hi>Immediate</hi> Fountain, but the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding muſt be ſaid to be the (<hi>Immediate</hi>) both Source and Chanell.)</p>
               <p>And thus his Lordſhips reaſon troubleth me not, <hi>viz. If the Soul com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate Light, then Hath it Light already, and ſo this Faculty, the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, is in vain.</hi> I ſay, the Soule <hi>hath</hi> This Light, which both flows <hi>from</hi> the Soule as an Eſſentiall Conſequent, and is Inherent <hi>in</hi> the Soule as an Inſeparable Accident.</p>
               <p>Next, why may not the <hi>Soule,</hi> or <hi>

                  </gap> And yet ſhall we not proceed <hi>in infinitum,</hi> For This generative faculty was produced by Another, and That again by Another, aſcending ſtill upwards till we come to the Generative Faculty of <hi>Adam,</hi> which was immediately produced of God, without an intervenient Faculty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> either by <hi>Concreation</hi> with the Soule; or by <hi>Infuſion,</hi> when he pronounced that bleſſing <hi>Increaſe and multiply.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, why may not this and other Faculties be produced <hi>in</hi> the Soule and <hi>with</hi> the Soule, by immediate creation, from <hi>God?</hi> I mean, if Soules be daily created, as moſt ſuppoſe; Or, if not, yet at leaſt the Faculties in <hi>Adams</hi> Soule might be by God Created or Concreated with it, notwithſtanding that they be diſtinct.</p>

               <p>But if by this, <hi>God gives not Light but to Light,</hi> he means, <hi>Lucem non dat niſi Luci,</hi> or <hi>Lumen non niſi Lumini;</hi> I cannot admit it, either <hi>in ſenſu compoſito,</hi> or <hi>in diviſo.</hi> When the Sunne imparts Light (<hi>Lumen</hi>) to the Ayr; the Ayr is <hi>Illuminate</hi> or Enlightned: But, that the Ayr is <hi>Lumen,</hi> I muſt never grant, till we ceaſe to hold, <hi>Lumen non eſt Corpus.</hi> So if God communicate to the Soule or Underſtanding the Light of Reaſon; the Soule or Underſtanding becomes thereby <hi>Illuminate</hi> or Enlightned with Reaſon: But, that the Soule or Underſtanding, is this <hi>Light,</hi> this <hi>Reaſon;</hi> follows no more then if you would ſay, That Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is <hi>Heat</hi> when it grows <hi>Hot;</hi> The Ayr is Light (<hi>Lumen,</hi>) when it is Enlightned; A Body becomes a <hi>Colour</hi> when it is <hi>Coloured;</hi> Any Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance whatſoever is metamorphiſed into an Accident, when (as a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject) it Receives that Accident; or That the Body of <hi>Adam,</hi> formed out of the Duſt, was <hi>made</hi> a Soule, when it <hi>received</hi> a Soule inſpired.</p>
               <p>That which is annexed as a proof; Becauſe <hi>Quicquid recipitur, recipitur ad modum recipientis,</hi> (together with the illuſtrations following;) proves no more but this, Whatſoever is conferred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is no further forth confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, then as the Subject is <hi>capable of,</hi> and <hi>actually doth</hi> receive it. And this we grant, That the Soule or Underſtanding, upon which the Light of Reaſon is conferred; is a <hi>fit Subject</hi> to receive or entertaine Reaſon, and is <hi>actually indued</hi> with Reaſon. And ſo I admit that which he cites of Dr. <hi>Twiſſe, Neither a quality permanent, nor an act immanent unleſſe they be made INHERENT IN the Soule,</hi> (obſerve the phraſe) <hi>and

the latter alſo produced by it, can be ſaid to be given to the Soule.</hi> Hee ſaith, It is <hi>Inherent in</hi> the Soule, not that <hi>it is</hi> the Soule.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly, How paſſeth</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>this Light from the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstanding to the Soule? there being as vast a diſtance between It and the Soule, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween It and the will, (ſuppoſing them diſtinct Faculties) whence grow thoſe inextricable diſputes, How the</hi> Will <hi>is made to</hi> Underſtand, <hi>what the</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding <hi>judgeth fit to be</hi> Willed.</p>
               <p>But here his Lordſhip varies ſomewhat the ſtate of the Queſtion in altering the acceptation of the word <hi>Truth,</hi> from truth <hi>underſtanding,</hi> to truth <hi>underſtood,</hi> and inſtead of <hi>innate</hi> truth of Reaſon, ſpeaks of the <hi>advenient</hi> truth, which is a <hi>Conceptus</hi> or <hi>Idea</hi> framed to repreſent the truth of <hi>Being</hi> in the Object.

               <p>But <hi>Truth <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtood,</hi> how it may be conveyed from the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to the Soul; I ſhall Then perhaps better tell when he ſhews me, How the <hi>Viſible Species</hi> are conveyed from the <hi>Organ</hi> to the <hi>Soul,</hi> or <hi>Faculty,</hi> ſeeing. That the <hi>Organ</hi> receives <hi>ſpecies,</hi> he will not deny; for elſe the Soul might as well ſee, when the Eye is out: That the <hi>Soul</hi> alſo (by the Organ) doth apprehend theſe <hi>Species,</hi> muſt likewiſe bee yeelded; elſe why ſhould not the Eye of a dead man ſee? That the <hi>Soule</hi> and the <hi>Organ</hi> are <hi>diſtinct,</hi> muſt needs be granted; for we ſee them really ſeparated by death, whereas nothing can be ſeparated from it ſelfe: And when I am informed, How the <hi>Soule</hi> and the <hi>Organ,</hi> being diſtinct, are conjoyned in <hi>Seeing;</hi> I ſhall better be able to reſolve, How the <hi>Soule</hi> and the <hi>Faculty,</hi> though diſtinct, may joyntly <hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> The ſame Argument further proſecuted and examined, in this and the enſuing Chapters.</head>
               <p>IN the next Chapter he ſhewes, That <hi>if we make the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding and Truth to be One,</hi> (which I ſuppoſe will be eaſily granted; there being but few or none which make the Soule, the Underſtanding, and Reaſon (that is, Truth) to be Three diſtinct things:) <hi>then will it be eaſie to find theſe three Requiſites: For thus Light or Truth is Diſpenſed; By the Father of Light; and hath for its Recipient, the whole Reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, conſisting of Body and Soule.</hi> All which I admit, (as likewiſe will thoſe that be his greateſt adverſaries:) onely with this <hi>Proviſo,</hi> That he make the entire <hi>Reaſonable creature</hi> to be <hi>ſubjectum Denominationis,</hi> and not <hi>ſubjectum Inhaeſionis,</hi> to Reaſon or Truth.</p>
               <p>Next, he ſpends ſome time to clear this, How the whole Reaſonable Creature can be ſaid to be the Recipient; which labour, in my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, might have been ſpared: For I cannot ſee any reaſon to fear, but that it will as eaſily be granted, that the <hi>Reaſonable Creature</hi> may be the Subject of <hi>Reaſon;</hi> as that the <hi>Ayr illuminate</hi> is the ſubject of <hi>Light:</hi> without any fear of Identity in the Thing Received with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipient.</p>
               <p>But it ſeems his Lordſhip ſpeaks of another kind of <hi>Recipiency</hi> beſide the Recipiency of a <hi>Subject:</hi> Such a kind of Recipiency as where the <hi>Recipiens</hi> and <hi>Receptum</hi> be the ſame. <hi>No Being</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>but it is the thing Receiving and Received: For conſider any Individuall Being you pleaſe, Vegetative or Rationall, or what you will; Who is it that entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this Being, but the Being it ſelfe which is entertained?

               <p>You may diſtinguiſh them thus, The Recipiency of a <hi>Being,</hi> and the Recipiency of a <hi>Form:</hi> And ſo, the Fountain or Efficient, <hi>dat Eſſe,</hi> and <hi>dat Habere.</hi> In the firſt kind of Giving and Receiving, the Recipient and the thing Received muſt of neceſſity be the ſame; Thus the Efficient or Producer of Light, <hi>dat Lucido ESSE Lucidum, dat Luci Eſſe Lucem,</hi> not <hi>dat Lucido eſſe Lucem.</hi> But in the ſecond it is otherwiſe, not <hi>dat Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cido HABERE Lucidum,</hi> nor <hi>Luci HABERE Lucem,</hi> but <hi>Lucido Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere Lucem.</hi> Thus the Efficient or Fountain of Reaſon, <hi>dat Rational<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Argument?</hi> which Argument? Doth he mean that argument which was laſt propounded, towards the end of the fifth chapter, [That becauſe God is one ſimple act; therefore, not only the Soule and its Faculties muſt be One, but even All Creatures muſt be One, becauſe there is in All ſomewhat of Gods Image, whoſe Eſſence is <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity?</hi>] If this be his Argument, I ſhall content my ſelf with a bare deniall of the Conſequence, till I ſee ſome ſhew of proofe. For, That Unity is Gods Eſſence, is (in my judgement) groſſely falſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Or, were it true, yet, That becauſe <hi>God</hi> is <hi>One,</hi> therefore the Creatures muſt alſo <hi>All</hi> be <hi>One;</hi> hath no ſtrength: For this <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> in God is equivalent to an infinite <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity.</hi> And, That One <hi>ſimple</hi> Efficient, may not produce <hi>diſtinct</hi> Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, ſeems to me a Paradox.</p>
               <p>Or is it his ſecond Argument, propounded in the ſecond chapter, and proſecuted in thoſe that follow; [That, to the conſtitution of every Creature there muſt be a <hi>Being</hi> communicated, a <hi>Fountain</hi> from whence,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:130470:22"/>
and a <hi>Recipient</hi> to which; the which <hi>Recipient</hi> muſt be the <hi>ſame</hi> with the <hi>Being received?</hi>] From hence perhaps he might prove, That every thing is the ſame with its own <hi>Being:</hi> But That very thing ſhould be the ſame with each other, or the ſame with reaſon, or the underſtanding; follows not.</p>
               <p>Is it then his firſt Argument, propounded towards the end of the firſt chapter? Which perhaps his Lordſhip lookes at as the principall Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and at all that follows, only as a Proſecution of that; (Though his Marginall notes, and the Titles of Chapters (which I queſtion whether or noe they be of his Lordſhips doing) point out to us diſtinct Arguments, in the beginning of the ſecond, and in the end of the fifth chapter.)</p>
               <p>The Argument was this, <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstanding is nothing but a Ray of the Divine Nature, &amp;c. And is not Truth the ſame?</hi> which I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as you may ſee, thus, [The Underſtanding is Gods Image in Man, And this Image conſiſts in Truth, or the Light of Reaſon; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Truth, or Reaſon, is the Underſtanding.] And thus the Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme will be true in the firſt figure, if you tranſpoſe the Premiſes and convert the Concluſion. Or thus, [The Image of God in Man is the Underſtanding; And this Image is Truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore (ſome) Truth is the Underſtanding:] And thus it will be true in the third figure. And beſide theſe two forms, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſee not how that Argument can be reduced to a true Syllogiſme. Now chuſe you which form you pleaſe; yet how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> ſhould follow from hence, [That All things elſe are this <hi>One</hi> Truth,] I do not yet perceive.</p>
               <p>It may be his Lordſhip would have his Argument thus ordered (in the ſecond figure) [The Underſtanding is a Ray of Divinity; And Truth alſo is a Ray of Divinity: therefore Truth is the Underſtanding, or Truth and the Underſtanding are One.] And if this be the form of his argument; I will eaſily grant, that it preſſeth all things that are, as much as this. For, is not this Syllogiſme in the ſame form, [The bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Angels are Spirituall Subſtances; And the damned Spirits are Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ſubſtances; Therefore the damned Spirits are bleſſed Angels, and the bleſſed Angels damned Spirits?] Then which Conſequent, ſcarce any thing could be leſſe probable. And thus indeed he may prove all things that are to be <hi>One</hi> Truth, one Underſtanding, yea one Stone, or what you will: For take any two Beings whatſoever, and they will both be ſound to be <hi>Rays of Divinity,</hi> becauſe both proceed from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ame Originall and Fountain of Being in the Divine Eſſence; and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:130470:23"/>
therefore (according to this Argument) they will be both <hi>One.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But his Argument thus ordered, will prove but a plaine Fallacy, offending againſt the Laws of the ſecond figure, wherein no affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive propoſition can be concluded.</p>
               <p>The moſt that he can prove from hence will be this, That there is ſome <hi>common Praedicate,</hi> which may be affirmed of <hi>Both;</hi> and ſo That there is ſome <hi>General</hi> Nature in which they both agree. And this I am confident there is none will ever deny that grants but this propoſition, <hi>Quicquid eſt, eſt E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>But this is farre enough from proving, <hi>All things to be One and the Same.</hi> For to aſſume [That whatſoever things agree in a <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſall</hi> Nature, are alſo the ſame Numericall and <hi>Individuall</hi> Exiſtence;] is ſuch a propoſition as Logick will not admit of.</p>
               <p>Yea, though his Argument ſhould proceed thus, [The <hi>Specificall Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> of the Underſtanding, conſiſts in this, that it is <hi>a Ray of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature;</hi> And the <hi>Specificall Eſſence,</hi> as well of Truth, as of <hi>all</hi> Beings whatſoever, is the Same, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is <hi>a Ray of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> And therefore all things whatſoever agree in the <hi>ſame ſpecificall Eſſence;</hi>) And (conſequently) all things whatſoever, having the <hi>ſame ſpecificall Eſſence</hi> with each other, muſt alſo be <hi>One and the Same</hi> with each other.] I ſay, though his Argument proceeded thus, yet would it little availe to prove <hi>All things to be One and the ſame.</hi> For, beſides, that the Specificall Eſſence of the Underſtanding (and ſo of other things) conſiſteth not in being a Ray of Divinity; Beſides this, I ſay, although they had all the ſame Specificall Eſſence; Yet doth it not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that they muſt be <hi>all</hi> One and the Same. For are there not many <hi>Individualls</hi> under the ſame <hi>Species,</hi> whereof One is not the Other?

                  </gap>ince they are both but <hi>Integrall</hi> Parts of the ſame <hi>Homogeneall</hi> Ocean? Yet how true it is withall, That the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is not the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea; and That the Water which is now in the <hi>Baltick,</hi> is diſtinct from that which at the ſame time is in the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean</hi> Sea?

never ſo Like; Yet we may truly ſay This is not the Other, nor the Other This. How then can it follow, That Truth is One with the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and That <hi>All things</hi> are this <hi>One Truth,</hi> Becauſe all Being is but <hi>a Ray of Divinity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It follows indeed, That if all Things have the ſame Specificall Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, then are they <hi>all,</hi> Things of the <hi>ſame nature;</hi> (but that they are <hi>all</hi> the Same <hi>Thing,</hi> it follows not.)</p>
               <p>Thus much therefore I ſuppoſe will be granted him by all, That All things are of the Same (at leaſt <hi>Genericall</hi>) nature, becauſe all things have a Being; And, When he hath proved their <hi>Specificall</hi> eſſence to be the ſame, It will be granted alſo, That they are all, Things of the ſame <hi>Specificall</hi> nature; and (if you will) That <hi>All Being falls under the ſame Praedicament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>But is this all he ſeeks to prove? I ſuppoſed he had laboured to ſhew That the <hi>Light</hi> of Truth or Reaſon was not onely of the <hi>ſame nature</hi> with the Underſtanding, but That it was the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi> Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he proves leſſe then his greateſt Adverſaries would have granted him. For thoſe that contend for the greateſt Diſtinction between the <hi>Soule</hi> and its <hi>Faculties,</hi> doe not yet maintain a more <hi>Reall</hi> or <hi>Phyſicall</hi> diſtinction between them, then is between One Soule and another, which yet agree in the ſame Eſſentiall Praedicates. And if you allow them the ſame diſtance between the Soul and the Underſtanding, which is between the Soule and a Stone, yea between two Soules, They will tell you it is more then they deſire: For they will grant that the <hi>Soule</hi> with all its Faculties, and the <hi>Body</hi> with all its Members, do conſtitute the ſame <hi>Suppoſitum;</hi> which is a more <hi>Phyſicall,</hi> a more <hi>Reall</hi> Union, then is between two Soules, though agreeing in every <hi>Eſſentiall Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But (if I miſtake not) that which he was about to prove, was, not that the Underſtanding is of the <hi>ſame Nature with Truth,</hi> but that <hi>it is Truth.</hi> His ſuppoſition in the firſt words of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And if ſo, Then muſt it be either thus underſtood, That All things are One and the Same by a <hi>Phyſicall</hi> Identity; This is the Other, and the Other is This; <hi>Bucephalus</hi> is <hi>Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> is <hi>Buce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalus:</hi> and (by the ſame reaſon) the Bread in the Lords Supper is the Body of Chriſt, and the Body of Chriſt is this Bread, by Conſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

               <p>To his third conſideration, I muſt anſwer accordingly as to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; <hi>All Being is received in the ſame manner by every Individuall Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence:</hi> That is, Every Creature receives its <hi>Being,</hi> by <hi>being What it is:</hi> A Stone and a Plant receive their ſeverall Beings, by being (ſeverally) what they are. But come to particulars, and the caſe is altered: A Stone receives its Being, by being a <hi>Stone;</hi> and a Plant receives its Being, by being a <hi>Plant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which followeth in the enſuing part of this Chapter (beſides what I have already touched by the way) I paſſe over as being Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory, rather then Probatory.

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Whether <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity be All in all things, <hi>or,</hi> the Eſſence of all things.</head>
               <p>ANd there we have it firſt propoſed to conſideration, <hi>Whether <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity be not in nature ſo glorious, and of that dignity, that it is able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form a Being,</hi> Yea, <hi>to be the Eſſentiall Form of all things?</hi> It is proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the ſeverall kinds of Beings. <hi>

               </p>
               <p>And firſt, <hi>Whether <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity be not All in God?</hi> (The Humility and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, which his Lordſhip uſeth in propoſing of it, may be a fit pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern for all to imitate, in all approaches to a <hi>Deity;</hi> Not onely in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Worſhip, but even in Scholaſtick Diſcourſes. And ſo neither to be peremptory in affirming, nor raſh in cenſuring: Since the vaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion between an infinite Object, and a finite Faculty, ſubjects our Underſtanding both to Ignorance and Errour; <hi>Suntque oculit te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nebrae per tantum lumen.) There is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>but One God; And more there could not be, ſince there cannot be Two Infinites, two Eternities; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could this One be otherwiſe, for then were he not Infinite. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity then being ſo inſeparable, as without which God could not be what he is, May it not be ſaid to be Co-eſſentiall to him? And if of his Eſſence, then is it in him All; for Gods Eſſence is All in God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Objection which his Lordſhip moves, <hi>viz. That there is the ſame reaſon for all other divine Attributes, they being all Eſſentiall to God, as well as <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity:</hi> Will bring the Queſtion to this Iſſue, <hi>Whether</hi> of theſe Attributes may be ſuppoſed in nature to be <hi>Firſt?</hi> (For that every of them ſhould be the <hi>formalis ratio</hi> of a ſimple Eſſence is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible:) And ſo, whether <hi>Infinity, &amp;c.</hi> do ariſe from <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> or <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> from thence?</p>
               <p>I ſhould rather ſay, That neither of theſe, or any other divine Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, may be ſaid to be <hi>formalis ratio,</hi> or the Eſſentiall form of the <hi>Deity;</hi> but ſomewhat elſe, in it ſelfe Simple, and yet comprehending all theſe: Which becauſe we cannot apprehend at <hi>One</hi> Diſcovery, we are fain to take ſeverall Views of it <hi>per inadaequatos conceptus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if we muſt needs ſeek for a <hi>Seniority</hi> in Gods Attributes; I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I might derive as clear a Pedigree of them from his <hi>Infinitneſſe,</hi> from his <hi>Perfection,</hi> from his <hi>Abſoluteneſſe</hi> or <hi>Independency;</hi> as can be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either from his <hi>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> or his <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> from his <hi>Infiniteneſſe?</hi> whether he muſt needs be Infinite, becauſe he is <hi>One;</hi> or One becauſe he is <hi>Infinite?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we ſay, God muſt needs be <hi>One,</hi> becauſe he is <hi>Infinite;</hi> his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip will not only aſſent, but furniſh us with a Reaſon, <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there cannot be Two Infinites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if otherwiſe we ſay, That God muſt of neceſſity be <hi>Infinite,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is <hi>One;</hi> It is not ſo eaſily proved, ſince there is but <hi>One Sunne,</hi> and yet that One Sunne not <hi>Infinite.</hi> How then can we ſay, That God is Eſſentially Infinite, or That Infiniteneſſe is Eſſentiall to him: If the <hi>Formalis ratio,</hi> the Eſſentiall Form of Divinity, may conſiſt without <hi>Infiniteneſſe?</hi> Sed <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>To his inſtances in <hi>Created Spirituall Beings.</hi> That <hi>all the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements</hi> are compriſed in <hi>Love,</hi> ſhews That there is ſomewhat <hi>Generall,</hi> that is common to them all; or rather <hi>Love</hi> (as likewiſe <hi>Obedience,</hi> and the like) is a <hi>Collective</hi> word, and an <hi>Integrum,</hi> whereof all thoſe are <hi>Parts:</hi> But that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> is either the Generall form of <hi>All</hi> the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, or the Particular of <hi>Any,</hi> it ſhews not.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> either the Generall of <hi>all,</hi> or Particular form of <hi>any</hi> Creature.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Morall</hi> Virtues are ſaid to be conjoyned or concatenate, becauſe they all proceed from one Fountain, <hi>viz.</hi> The abſolute Subordination of the Will and Affections to the Underſtanding: which Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation they call <hi>Prudence,</hi> (and is of the ſame extent in Morality, that <hi>Obedience</hi> is in Divinity) whereof all the morall Virtues are but Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grall parts. (But I had rather apply <hi>Prudence</hi> to the Underſtanding only; as that whereby it is able to judge in all Practicall things, what is fit to be done; And the univerſall Conformity of the Will to this univerſall Rule of Reaſon, I ſhould call <hi>Juſtitia Vniverſali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And thus I underſtand that Axiom, That <hi>morall Virtues are concate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in Prudence:</hi> Becauſe where there is this univerſall Subjection of the Will to Reaſon, there will be an obſervance of it in all particulars. But if the rules of ſome Virtues are obſerved, and not the rules of others; there this obſervance is not a Virtuous action, as not proceeding
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:130470:28"/>
from the ſubordination of the Will to Reaſon, (which would have as well prevailed in others alſo) but from ſome other Principle.</p>
               <p>Now this ſhews perhaps, That the Morall Virtues are <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited</hi> in One generall <hi>Eſſence:</hi> But how appears it, That this <hi>Eſſence</hi> is <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Phyſicall Beings,</hi> as <hi>Water-drops</hi> (and other <hi>Connaturalls,</hi> either of the Same, or Concordant Species; as the Loadſtone and Iron) deſire to preſerve their Union and Neighbourhood one with another: But let us conſider the ground; Do they deſire to preſerve their <hi>Eſſence</hi> that they may be <hi>One,</hi> that is, United or Joyned together; or do they deſire <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> and <hi>Conjunction,</hi> that they may preſerve their <hi>Eſſence?</hi> This latter I ſuppoſe; And therefore a drop of water doth not deſire to <hi>Bee,</hi> to the end that it may be <hi>Conjoyned</hi> with the reſt, but deſires to be <hi>Conjoyned</hi> for its <hi>Preſervation,</hi> leſt it ſhould ceaſe to be.

               <p>In ſumme, All thoſe inſtances in Nature (which doubtleſſe are very many) whereby it may appear that all things naturally do deſire <hi>

But what is there in all this to perſwade us, that Unity is their <hi>Eſſence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Mathematicall</hi> Unity of Harmony, Proportion &amp;c. It being only Relative (for they denote but the Relation of one thing to another) can conferre nothing to the conſtitution of an Abſolute Eſſence, as of Sounds, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But how this ſhould any way conferre to the deciding of that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, whether <hi>Quantity</hi> be <hi>diviſibilis in ſemper diviſibilia:</hi> ſeems to me a greater myſtery, then this Myſtery that is to be cleared. For as long as <hi>Mathematicall Demonstrations</hi> ſhall be thought worthy of credit, it ſhall <hi>Never</hi> be granted, that <hi>Continuum conſtat ex indiviſibilibus.</hi> And however ſome <hi>Naturaliſts,</hi> that know little what belongs to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Quantity, make much adoe to the contrary, and therby bewray their groſſe Ignorance in theſe things; Yet I am confident, that not any One <hi>Mathematician</hi> (deliberately, and in a Mathematicall way) either <hi>ever did,</hi> or <hi>ever will</hi> aſſent to them. And I cannot without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation (or Pity rather) read ſometimes how fondly and vainly ſome (otherwiſe) able Schollars think to ſhift off Mathematicall Arguments
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:130470:28"/>
in this and the like caſes; which will not be ſo eaſily baffled by an empty Verball Diſtinction, as ſome of their Idle Fallacies may. And if I make it not evident (to thoſe that are acquainted with Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call terms) that a <hi>Continuum</hi> conſiſts not of Indiviſible Points, by as certain and infallible Mathematicall Demonſtrations, as That 2. and 2. make 4. I will hereafter turn <hi>Sceptick,</hi> and affirm confidently That we are <hi>ſure</hi> of nothing.</p>
               <p>If a Line conſiſt of Indiviſible points, each Point is ſuppoſed to be <hi>Minimum poſſibile,</hi> by thoſe that doe maintain it; (or elſe how are they <hi>Indiviſible.</hi>) Then muſt all Points be <hi>Equall;</hi> (for if they be Unequall, they cannot all be <hi>minima.</hi>) Then no Two Lines can poſſibly be <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or <hi>Incommenſurable;</hi> (for if all Lines doe conſiſt of Points whereof each is equall to other, then are all lines whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver meaſurable by this common meaſure of a Point; <hi>qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now that two Contradictory Propoſitions ſhould be true by Mathematicall Demonſtration, is utterly impoſſible.</p>
               <p>Thouſands of the like Demonſtrations might be brought to prove it; As, that from hence, All <hi>Angles</hi> may be demonſtrated to be <hi>Equall;</hi> The ſame <hi>Line,</hi> to be <hi>Shorter,</hi> to be <hi>Longer</hi> then it ſelfe, to be <hi>equall</hi> to <hi>two</hi> or more conjoyned, and yet to be <hi>ſhorter</hi> then either; Yea, all <hi>Lines</hi> to be <hi>equall,</hi> All <hi>Circles</hi> of the ſame <hi>bigneſſe,</hi> The <hi>Equinoctiall Circle</hi> to be no bigger then a <hi>Ciphar,</hi> All <hi>Motions</hi> to be of the ſame <hi>ſwiftneſſe,</hi> All <hi>Bodies</hi> of the ſame <hi>weight,</hi> and of the ſame <hi>bigneſſe:</hi> And yet in the meane time All theſe to be <hi>unequall,</hi> in Length, Weight, Swiftneſſe, &amp;c. And infinite the like abſurdities; as might be ſhewed, if this were the Queſtion I had in hand. Take an inſtance or two.</p>
               <p>Let two Circles be deſcribed upon the ſame Center, of what great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe you pleaſe; Let a Thread be faſtned at the common Center, and ſo extended that it cut the Circumference of both Circles; Thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, the one end being faſtned at the Center, let the other end be moved round: Now while this Thread paſſeth over one Point in the Greater Circle, I demand how much it paſſeth over in the Leſſer? Leſſe then a Point it cannot be, becauſe <hi>ex hypotheſi,</hi> a Point is <hi>Minimum
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:130470:29"/>
poſsibile;</hi> For every Point therefore that it paſſeth over in the Greater Circle, it paſſeth over a Point anſwerable in the Leſſer Circle; There be therefore as many points in the Leſſer as are in the Greater Circle; and theſe Points being all Equall, becauſe every one is <hi>Minimum poſsibile,</hi> the Leſſer Circle muſt needs be equall to the Greater Circle, becauſe it conſiſts of as many Points; and by the ſame reaſon, <hi>All Circles Equall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Thread thus moving, move it never ſo Slowly, it paſſeth over <hi>a Point</hi> in a Moment; and move it never ſo Swiftly, it paſſeth <hi>but a Point</hi> in a Moment: And therefore all <hi>Motions</hi> are alike <hi>Swift,</hi> as paſſing over equall diſtances in equall time.</p>
               <p>Again, Let two Lines concurring in the ſame Point make an Angle, (of what greatneſſe you pleaſe;) their Two next Points, joyning upon this common Point of concurrence, will terminate a Baſis of Two Points, (not more, for then the <hi>Subtendent</hi> would be equall to both the <hi>Crura.</hi>) The two Third points will terminate a Line ſomewhat longer then the other, and therefore at leaſt of Three points; and ſo on, for every point added to the <hi>Crura,</hi> (be the angle greater or leſſe) you muſt adde one point to the length of the <hi>Baſis,</hi> ſubtendent to that angle (and more then One it cannot be, for then the increaſe of the <hi>Baſis</hi> will be equall to the encreaſe of both the <hi>Crura:</hi>) Whence it will come to paſſe That all Angles (at an equall diſtance from the point of concurrence) will have their Subtendents equall (the <hi>Baſis</hi> or Subtendent being thus meaſured by the length of the <hi>Crura,</hi> or lines containing the angle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> The Nature of Habits Whether they be one with Truth or the Soules Eſſence.</head>
               <p>IN the eighth Chapter, he ſpeaks ſomewhat concerning the nature of Habits. And this is to be adjoyned to the end of the 5. Chapter: the 6. and 7. Chapters, (wherein he inferres a Corollary, concerning the Eſſence of All things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That it is <hi>One,</hi> That it is <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity;</hi>) being inſerted as a Parentheſis. He had in the fifth Chapter affirmed <hi>That the Soul is nothing but Truth; Yet</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>while I affirm, that the Soule is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but this Truth, I doe not refuſe the doctrine of Habits, either Infuſed or Acquiſite.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But before I proceed, It is not amiſſe to give notice of a different ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of <hi>Truth</hi> here, from that before. He ſpake before of the Truth or Light of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> which he contended, to be <hi>One</hi> with the Soul, and not a diſtinct Faculty. This Light was an <hi>Innate</hi> or <hi>Connate</hi> Light, which hath its Originall and its Period with the Soule: For when the Soule begins, the Light of Reaſon begins, and this Light of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is no ſooner extinct, then when the Soule ſhall ceaſe to be. But the Light of <hi>Habituall</hi> Knowledge, (whether Infuſed or Acquiſite,) is not an <hi>Innate</hi> Light, but an <hi>Advenient</hi> Light; ſubſequent to the Soules firſt Exiſtence, and really ſeparable from it. Yet may it be Antecedent to another degree of Advenient Light, <hi>viz. Actuall</hi> Knowledge, which may proceed from Habituall.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Advenient</hi> Light of <hi>Habituall knowledge</hi> differs from <hi>Innate</hi> Light of <hi>Reaſon;</hi> as a <hi>Habit</hi> in the firſt ſpecies of <hi>Quality,</hi> from <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralis potentia,</hi> or a <hi>Faculty,</hi> in the ſecond ſpecies. And ſo, howſoever it may be true, That a <hi>Faculty</hi> or <hi>Naturall Power,</hi> may be ſo farre the <hi>Same</hi> with the Soule, as that it differ only <hi>ratione ratiocinatâ;</hi> Yet in a <hi>Habit,</hi> we muſt of neceſſity grant a diſtinction <hi>ex parte rei.</hi> For where there may be a <hi>Reall Separation</hi> (and not onely Mentall) there muſt needs be granted a Diſtinction <hi>in re.</hi> Now that in all Habits there may be a reall Separation, is apparent: For (though, it may be, ſome Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits acquired or infuſed cannot be loſt when they are once had, as Grace, &amp;c. yet) before the acquiſition or infuſion of ſuch Habits, the Soule was actually without them. Indeed it is true, That theſe <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits</hi> cannot ſubſiſt <hi>without the Soule;</hi> and therefore they may not be imagined to be <hi>Really</hi> diſtinct, as <hi>res &amp; res;</hi> yet becauſe the Soule may exiſt <hi>without theſe;</hi> therefore they muſt have a <hi>Modall</hi>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:130470:31"/>
diſtinction <hi>in re,</hi> as <hi>res &amp; modus.</hi> Thus the Roundneſſe of a piece of Coyn, though, when it is, it is the ſame Thing with the Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, not being a <hi>Thing</hi> added, but only a <hi>Modification,</hi> a moulding or faſhioning of the Former thing; yet muſt it be <hi>Diſtinct</hi> from the eſſence of the Silver, though not a <hi>Thing diſtinct:</hi> Otherwiſe when this Silver looſeth its Roundneſſe, it ſhould looſe its Eſſence and become ſomwhat elſe; whereas the Silver in this form, is not really diſtinct from it ſelfe in another forme, but the ſame Metall, the ſame Silver.</p>
               <p>There being then this difference between a Habite and a Faculty: Though <hi>Reaſon</hi> ſhould be <hi>One</hi> with the ſoule without ſo much as a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall</hi> diſtinction; yet follows it not, that a <hi>Habit</hi> hath the ſame Reall Identity, but that it may be diſtinguiſhed <hi>ex parte rei.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Habits</hi> he diſtinguiſheth into <hi>Infuſed</hi> and <hi>Acquiſite. When the ſoul</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>by vertue of its Being is cleare in ſuch a Truth; it is ſaid to be an Infuſed habit: when by frequent action, ſuch a Truth is Connaturall to the Soule, it may be ſtiled an Habit Acquiſite, though &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whether or no this be the genuine diſtinction between an <hi>Acquiſite</hi> and <hi>Infuſed</hi> Habit, it is not materiall ſtrictly to examine. If the ſoule by its Eſſence be cleare in ſuch a Truth; that is, be ready to act accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſuch a Truth: I ſhould call this a <hi>Faculty</hi> or <hi>Naturall power,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then an <hi>Habit.</hi> Thus <hi>Gravity</hi> in a Stone, whereby it is naturally prone to deſcend, I ſhould not call an <hi>Habit,</hi> but a <hi>Faculty.</hi> (Though Heavineſſe, in another relation, be neither a Faculty nor an Habit, but <hi>qualitas Patibilis.</hi> And ſo perhaps may <hi>Knowledge,</hi> as it is an accidentall Form <hi>informing</hi> the ſoule, be referred to the ſame ſpecies of Quality, though it can hardly be called by that Name: For a Habit <hi>quatenus ſic,</hi> is ſo called, not with any relation to the <hi>Subject,</hi> but in relation to <hi>Acts,</hi> which ſlow from it, or are produced by it.)</p>
               <p>This <hi>Proneneſſe</hi> or <hi>Aptneſſe for operation</hi> which is in any thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly from its <hi>Eſſence,</hi> is a <hi>naturall Power</hi> or <hi>Faculty;</hi> And a <hi>Habit,</hi> is a further Readineſſe, and Pliableneſſe, or <hi>Facility</hi> of working accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this <hi>Faculty:</hi> A Habit therefore alwayes <hi>preſuppoſeth</hi> a Faculty, as being but a Facilitation of it. And when as by <hi>Reaſon</hi> a man hath an <hi>Ability</hi> to underſtand: by Habituall <hi>Knowledge,</hi> he hath a <hi>Readineſſe</hi> to underſtand.</p>
               <p>Now this <hi>Readineſſe</hi> or <hi>Facility,</hi> if it proceed from <hi>Often Acting;</hi> ſo that from the iterating of former Acts it becomes more prone either to continue or repeate thoſe Acts; It is an <hi>Acquiſite</hi> Habit: (Somewhat of this may be ſeene in Naturall things; A Wheele being once in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

               <p>A Habit therefore, whether Infuſed or Acquiſite, being but a Faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litation of the Faculty, cannot be a <hi>Thing</hi> diſtinct from that Faculty, but only a <hi>Modus</hi> of it, which hath not in it ſelfe a Poſitive Abſolute Being of its own; but is a Modification of another Being: And its <hi>Phyſicall</hi> Being, <hi>Exiſtentia Rei,</hi> muſt be the ſame with the Being of that, which is thus Modificated; For it is not <hi>ipſum Exiſtens,</hi> but <hi>Modus Exiſtendi:</hi> And this <hi>Manner of Exiſting</hi> hath not an Exiſtence of its own, diſtinct from the Exiſtence of that which doth exiſt in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: Yet its <hi>Formall</hi> and <hi>Metaphyſicall</hi> Being is diſtinct.

               <p>I am called in the next place, to ſearch out the <hi>difference between Reaſon and Faith. They differ</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>only in Degrees, not in Nature: For if Soule, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, Habits be all the ſame, then neither doe Reaſon and Faith differ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I grant that there is the ſame ground, why wee ſhould make <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> the Same; that there is to make the <hi>Faculty</hi> and the <hi>Habit</hi> the Same. Reaſon is a <hi>Faculty,</hi> Faith a <hi>Habit:</hi> Now a Faculty and a Habit, I have before ſayd not to be <hi>res &amp; res,</hi> but <hi>res &amp; modus.</hi> Their <hi>Phyſicall</hi> Difference therefore (I mean, if you conſider Faith and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the ſame man) is but <hi>Modall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it doth not follow from hence, That they differ not <hi>in Nature.</hi> For though an Habit have not <hi>Entitatem Rei,</hi> diſtinct from the Faculty; yet it hath <hi>Entitatem Modi;</hi> ſo that the Habit is not a Faculty, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the Faculty an Habit.</p>
               <p>To enquire of a <hi>Phyſicall</hi> Identity, and of a <hi>Metaphyſicall</hi> or <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall</hi> Identity, are <hi>quaere's</hi> farre diſtinct. The Faith of <hi>Peter</hi> is Really and Phyſically diſtinct from the Faith of <hi>Paul;</hi> and yet their Metaphyſicall Formall nature is exactly the Same. Again, all the <hi>Modall</hi> Beings in the ſame ſubject, though their Eſſence and Nature be never ſo diſtinct (<hi>v. g.</hi> Duration, Augmentation, Situation &amp;c, in the ſame man) be Really the ſame; (for neither of them, being <hi>Modi,</hi> have any <hi>Entitatem Rei,</hi> beſide the Entity of their common Subject, and ſo cannot make a <hi>Reall</hi> diſtinction, becauſe there is not <hi>res &amp; res:</hi>) Yet each <hi>Modus</hi> hath a diſtinct <hi>Formall</hi> nature of its own: The nature of a <hi>Figure,</hi> is not the nature of a <hi>Habit,</hi> though both in the ſame Subject.</p>
               <p>But yet, though it doe not follow from that Reall Identity between <hi>Res &amp; Modus,</hi> that the Nature of Reaſon and the Nature of Faith be the ſame: Yet if he change but the terms, and ſay (in ſtead of Reaſon) that Knowledge and Faith are the ſame in nature, I will not contend: So that he mean Faith as it is an Act or Habit of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstanding,</hi> and not of the <hi>Will.</hi> For ſo, Faith is an Aſſent to a Truth reveiled: &amp; the ſame individuall Aſſent to the ſame Truth, may be both <hi>Cognitio Scientiae,</hi> and <hi>Cognitio Fidei<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> I will inſtance in the <hi>Creation of the world:</hi> By <hi>Faith</hi> we know that the worlds were made, and Aſſent to it: And by <hi>naturall Demonſtrations</hi> it may be proved, that the world was made; and theſe alſo are ſufficient to perſwade aſſent. Now we from both grounds (joyntly) aſſent to this Propoſition, That the world was made. The which <hi>Aſſent</hi> in reſpect of the one Ground (<hi>propter eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:130470:34"/>
rei</hi>) is an aſſent of <hi>Science</hi> or Naturall Knowledge; in regard of the other Ground (<hi>Propter authoritatem dicentis</hi>) is an aſſent of <hi>Faith,</hi> or Supernaturall and reveiled Knowledge. The aſſent of Science, and of Faith, differ not in their Form, but in their Efficient.</p>
               <p>But if he ſpeak of <hi>Saving</hi> Faith (<hi>quatenus Salvifica</hi>) as it doth Save: ſo it is an act of the Will, and not of the Underſtanding; and therefore differs from Knowledge.</p>
               <p>But, to conclude this: If we ſpeak of a <hi>Phyſicall</hi> difference or diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Then all the <hi>Modi</hi> that belong to the <hi>ſame Thing,</hi> can admit of no more then a <hi>Modall</hi> diſtinction: becauſe having no other <hi>Entita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem Rei,</hi> but that of the common Subiect, their <hi>Entitas Rei</hi> muſt be Common; there cannot be <hi>Res &amp; Res:</hi> the difference muſt be either <hi>tanquam Res &amp; Modus,</hi> or <hi>tanquam Modus &amp; Modus:</hi> And here is no conſideration of the <hi>Nature</hi> of theſe <hi>Modi.</hi> In <hi>distinct Things;</hi> The <hi>Modi</hi> are <hi>Really</hi> diſtinct and not <hi>Modally</hi> though theſe <hi>Modi</hi> be exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the ſame nature; as the Roundneſſe of ſeverall Circles; For they not having <hi>Entitatem Rei</hi> beſides the Entity of their Subjects; their Subjects being really diſtinct, they muſt be really diſtinct alſo.</p>
               <p>(Thus in the preſent caſe, The Faith of <hi>Peter</hi> is <hi>really</hi> diſtinct from the Faith of <hi>Paul:</hi> But <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Peter</hi> from <hi>Reaſon</hi> in <hi>Peter</hi> is only <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dally</hi> diſtinct, <hi>tanquam Res &amp; Modus; (viz.</hi> If you make <hi>Reaſon</hi> to be <hi>Res,</hi> or a Faculty Really diſtinct from the ſoule:) and the Habit of <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Peter</hi> will be diſtinct from all other <hi>Habits</hi> in <hi>Peter (v. g.</hi> from the Habit of <hi>Knowledge) tanquam Modus &amp; Modus.</hi>)</p>
               <p>But if wee ſpeak, not of a Phyſicall, but of a <hi>Metaphyſicall</hi> Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; Here it little avails to enquire of their <hi>Phyſicall</hi> Difference, or Identity. For thoſe things that are <hi>really distinct,</hi> as two Souls, may yet agree in the <hi>ſame Specificall Nature:</hi> and thoſe which are not really diſtinct (as ſeverall <hi>Modi</hi> of the ſame <hi>Thing</hi>) may have their Formall Specificall differences.</p>
               <p>Again, though it be granted that Naturall Knowledge (attained by by the uſe of Reaſon, without a ſupernaturall Revelation) be <hi>of the ſame Nature</hi> with Faith; Yet doth it not preſently follow, That their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is <hi>Graduall,</hi> and the one but a greater Degree of the ſame Light: For Skill in <hi>Muſick</hi> and Skill in <hi>Metalls</hi> or <hi>Mineralls,</hi> are both <hi>Naturall Habits;</hi> yet the Skill of a Muſician, and the Skill of a Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt are not the <hi>Same</hi> (though of the ſame nature;) neither yet is their difference <hi>Graduall;</hi> For the one is not the way to attain the other and the other a Perfection of that former. And moreover a man
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:130470:34"/>
may be skilfull in either of them without a knowledge of the other, whereas a Greater Degree of Knowledge in the ſame Kind cannot be without the Leſſer.</p>
               <p>That which follows, concerning <hi>Falling from Grace,</hi> and the <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Will,</hi> (as alſo what proceeds, How farre we do <hi>acti agere,</hi> that is, How farre, and In what manner, the Firſt cauſe doth concurre with the Second in its Operations) require a larger diſcourſe for the deciding of them, then to be toucht at <hi>in tranſitu,</hi> and by the way. I ſhall therefore ſay onely this (and ſo paſſe them over;) <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Servitude</hi> are oppoſit; and both are Relative terms. He that is Free from the Dominion of one Maſter, may be a Servant, a Slave, to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Thus the Will, though it be Free from any <hi>Naturall Neceſſity,</hi> either from within, or without; ſo that it be neither determined by an inward Principle, as meer Naturall Agents are; neither can have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Compulſion, or Neceſſity, impoſed upon it by the command of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Creature: Yet is it not Free from the <hi>Command</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of God, by whoſe <hi>Abſolute Decree</hi> it is determined. We muſt not ſo farre affect to be <hi>Liberi,</hi> that we become <hi>Sacrilegi;</hi> we muſt not vindicate our Liberty by committing Sacriledge, exempting our ſelves from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the Power of a Deity.</p>
               <p>If I were now to examine the nature of <hi>Freedome,</hi> wherein it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts: I might perhaps place it in a <hi>Spontaneity,</hi> that it acts <hi>without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy, Sponte agit:</hi> Were it not that even Naturall Agents (as a Stone falling) have ſuch a free action, without Conſtraint, without Reluctancie.</p>
               <p>Or it might be placed perhaps in a <hi>Reflection</hi> upon its own Act; whereby it doth not onely <hi>Agere,</hi> yea and <hi>Sponte</hi> (or <hi>volens) agere,</hi> without a Nolition, a <hi>Renitentia;</hi> But alſo <hi>Vult agere:</hi> Whereas a Naturall agent, though perhaps <hi>Sponte</hi> or <hi>Volens agit,</hi> yet you cannot ſay <hi>Vult agere,</hi> becauſe there is not a Reflection whereby it <hi>Willeth</hi> its Action. That which hinders me from placing it in this, is, Becauſe I allow not any <hi>reflex</hi> act of <hi>Willing</hi> in God, beſides that direct act of <hi>Working,</hi> who is yet a moſt <hi>Free</hi> Agent. For (beſide other reaſons, that if need were, might be produced) it ſtands not with Gods <hi>Simplicity,</hi> to admit <hi>diſtinct acts</hi> in God, whereof one ſhould be the <hi>Object</hi> of another. Now what ſtrength there is in this, to hinder the placing of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in this Reflex act, I propoſe to be conſidered, rather then Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm.</p>
               <p>But I rather place the nature of the Wills <hi>Liberty,</hi> in a <hi>Freedome</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:130470:35"/>
from <hi>Servitude,</hi> that it is not under the command of any Creature, or a Naturall Determination of its own. And therfore though it be free from ſuch ſervitude as a <hi>Naturall</hi> agent, or ſuch as may be <hi>Forced,</hi> is ſubject to; yet it is not free from <hi>Gods Command;</hi> Nor (perhaps) from the <hi>dictate</hi> of <hi>Reaſon</hi> neither, Or, if it be, yet is not this its <hi>Freedome,</hi> but its <hi>Weakneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is not far diſtant from the received opinion, which makes it conſiſt <hi>in Indifferentiâ.</hi> For the Will can <hi>agere vel non agere</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding anything to the contrary from the Creature; but it cannot <hi>age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re vel non agere</hi> notwithſtanding the Decree of God; and therfore is not Free from that Determination. And whereas other things are from God determined <hi>mediante cauſa ſecundâ,</hi> the Will is <hi>Immediately</hi> deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined <hi>a cauſa primâ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore what he cites out of <hi>Rutterfort, That granting all things to be under an abſolute Decree, it is fond to aske, Whether the Free Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture remain indifferent to doe or not to doe;</hi> I willingly aſſent unto. But you muſt conſider withall, that <hi>This</hi> Freedome neither the Angels have, nor had <hi>Adam</hi> in his Innocencie.</p>
               <p>And therefore, when Divines tell us, that by the Fall we have loſt our Liberty, or Freedome of Will, in Spirituall things, which yet we retain in Morall and Civill Actions; I deſire that they would more punctually ſet down, What the Liberty is, which we retain in Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things, but want in Spirituall; What Liberty that is, which the Angels have, and Man once had, but hath now loſt: And not ſpeak of ſuch a Liberty as neither Man or Angel ever had, nor is it poſſible for any Creature to have; Nay not for God himſelfe, For God having once decreed, cannot with his Truth revoke it, nor is indifferent to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it or not; But, as They ſay of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> which make Him to be the Author of their Stoicall unavoidable Fate (underſtanding it <hi>cum grano ſalis</hi>) He once Commanded, and ever after Obeyed.</p>
               <p>There follows in the next place, an Objection, <hi>How it comes to paſſe, if Faith and Knowledge be One, that ſome who have more Knowledge have leſſe Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I need not recite his Lordſhips Anſwer, I will only propoſe my own. If there be meant a <hi>Phyſicall</hi> Identity, whereby two <hi>Modi</hi> of the ſame Thing doe ſubſiſt by the ſubſiſtence of their common Subject, it is not hard to determine: For two Modifications of the ſame Thing may yet be independent of each other: And therefore it is not requiſite they ſhould be both in the ſame meaſure, or degree.</p>

               <p>And yet if this too cleare experience be not able to prove it, but that you ſtill lay all the blame upon the Underſtanding, as not being cleare enough in its Apprehenſions, or not ſufficiently Peremptory in its Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates; and ſo excuſe the Will of all Remiſſeneſſe: I demand then, what diſability there is in the <hi>Will</hi> of Man ſince the fall more then in the confirmed Angels and Saints in Heaven? I cannot think but that the Image of God, by the Fall, is defaced in the Will as well as in the Underſtanding; and yet if the Will doe never diſobey the Light of Reaſon, which is its ſole (immediate) Guide, I ſee not wherein this diſability doth appear.</p>
               <p>I grant that the Will doth always <hi>Follow</hi> the Underſtanding, that is, it never goes before it, or without it; it goes never but where the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding hath led the way, in diſcovering ſome Good, (more or leſſe,) ſomething Deſirable. For the Will is <hi>Caeca potentia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and Knows of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing deſirable, but what the Underſtanding diſcovers. And Knowing nothing, can Deſire nothing; <hi>Ignoti nulla Cupido.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But yet I grant not that Propoſition in this ſenſe, The will <hi>Allwayes</hi> follows the Underſtanding; that is, It never ſtays behind. For to Omit what the Underſtanding commands, requires not a diſcovery of ſome other Good, but only an Impotency, a Backwardneſſe, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſneſſe to doe its Duty. <hi>To goe</hi> without direction, requires a Poſitive Cauſe, becauſe it is a Poſitive Act; But <hi>Not to goe</hi> when it is directed, may proceed from a Negative Cauſe <hi>(Negatio Cauſae,)</hi> becauſe it is a
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:130470:36"/>
Negative Act, or a Not-doing. A lame man doth not runne, when he knows, that he ought to runne; yet here is no need of a Poſitive Cauſe to ſtay him, but his Impotency (a Negative cauſe) ſufficeth.</p>
               <p>And thus farre do I admit that diſtinction of <hi>Libertas Contrarietatis,</hi> and <hi>Libertas Contradictionis,</hi> though in that way in which it is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily made uſe of, I doe wholly reject it. There is not in the Will an Indifferency to chooſe <hi>Good</hi> or to chooſe <hi>Evill;</hi> neither yet to <hi>Chooſe</hi> good, or <hi>Reject</hi> good <hi>(velle &amp; nolle;)</hi> both which they call <hi>Libertas Contrietatis.</hi> For the Underſtanding doth not ſhew any <hi>Amiable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> or Lovelyneſſe in Evill; nor any <hi>Odiouſneſſe</hi> in Good <hi>(quatenus ſic;)</hi> and therefore the Will cannot Deſire <hi>Evill,</hi> nor Reject <hi>Good (Nolle,</hi> or <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>elle non.</hi>) For <hi>Bonitas</hi> is <hi>Objectum formale Appetitûs;</hi> and <hi>Malum</hi> is the <hi>formall Object</hi> of <hi>Nolition.</hi> Now the Soule cannot <hi>velle quatenus bonum,</hi> that in which no <hi>Good</hi> is apprehended; nor <hi>nolle quatenus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi> (that is, <hi>velle ut non ſit</hi>) that wherein it apprehends no <hi>Evill.</hi> But for the other kinde of Indifferency, (which they call <hi>Libertas Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictionis,</hi>) to <hi>Will</hi> good, or <hi>Not Will</hi> it; to <hi>Nill Evill,</hi> or <hi>Not to Nill</hi> it; This I acknowledge to be in the Will. For that by reaſon of its Imbecil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, it is not ſo ready to execute its Functions as it ought to be.</p>
               <p>But yet I do not conceive the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the Will to conſiſt in this; Or, that this is any <hi>Perfection</hi> to the Will, To be able to Suſpend its Act, notwithſtanding the Underſtandings direction to the contrary. (For this the <hi>Angells</hi> Confirmed cannot doe, nor the <hi>Saints</hi> Glorified; for if their Will could act contrary to their Underſtanding, then could they Sinne; And yet theſe Agents are no leſſe <hi>Free,</hi> then Man is: Yea God, who is the moſt abſolutely-Free Agent, yet cannot Will or Decree that which is contrary to his Sapience, <hi>(intellectus divinus;)</hi> his Will never thwarts his Wiſdome.) But I conceive it to be an <hi>Imperfection</hi> or <hi>Weakneſſe</hi> in mans Will; which, Before the Fall, was not ſo Stable, but that it <hi>might Fall;</hi> and is Now become ſo Weak, that it is <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nable to Staud.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The common Opinion is, That, If the Will cannot diſobey the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Underſtanding, then is it not a <hi>Free</hi> faculty but all its acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are determined by the Underſtanding, while It dictates, that this or that is to be done or omitted; and ſo <hi>Freedome</hi> ſhould be placed in the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> and not in the <hi>Will.</hi> I may adde, (to help their cauſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward) that there may ſeem to be no Freedome at all: For the <hi>Will</hi> is determined by the dictate of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstanding,</hi> and therefore in it is no freedom, no Election; and the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> (by generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) is not Free, to judge this or that as it pleaſeth, but muſt aſſent or
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:130470:36"/>
diſſent according to its Light: ſo that Here will be no Freedom nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For this reaſon they ſay, That the Will is not neceſſitated to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the dictate of Reaſon; but when the Underſtanding hath declared what it can, it is yet in the power of the Will to Chooſe.</p>
               <p>But then, leaſt they ſhould fall upon another rock, <hi>viz.</hi> That, if the Will may reject the Underſtandings advice; then may it deſire that which the Underſtanding affirms to be Evill; contrary to that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, That Good is the only Object of Deſire: To avoid that danger, they have found out this diſtinction of <hi>Libertas Contrarietatis</hi> and <hi>liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas Contradictionis,</hi> which they apply thus; The Will hath power indeed to diſobey that which the Underſtanding propoundeth: But yet not ſo, as if, of two Objects, whereof the Underſtanding Allows of one, and Diſallows of the other, it were free notwithſtanding to imbrace Either; But when an Object is commended by the Underſtanding, though the Will cannot <hi>Elect</hi> its Contrary, yet it may <hi>not-elect</hi> this, it may chooſe whether or no it will Imbrace it. And thus they think the whole matter is ſalved.</p>
               <p>This Anſwer may ſeem plauſible, and hath paſt for current: But yet (with their leaves) the Wound, though perhaps skinned over, is not ſo eaſily Healed. For if they may not admit the Liberty of <hi>Contrariety:</hi> they may not (in my judgement) admit the Other. For when the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding commends an Object to the Will, as that which Ought to be Deſired, here are two oppoſite terms, to <hi>Imbrace,</hi> or <hi>not Imbrate; (age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, ſuſpendere:)</hi> The Underſtanding ſaith, <hi>Agendum eſt,</hi> it Ought to be <hi>Imbraced;</hi> The Will chooſeth rather <hi>not to Imbrace</hi> it, but to <hi>Suſpend</hi> its Act. The Underſtanding adviſeth One extream; the Will chooſeth the Other extream. The Underſtanding ſaith, It is <hi>Good</hi> to Act, and (conſequently) it is <hi>Ill</hi> to Omit, to ſuſpend; the Will notwithſtanding chooſeth to Suſpend (which the Underſtanding affirms to be <hi>Evill,</hi>) ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to Act, which the Underſtanding commends as <hi>Good.</hi> Thus that <hi>libertas Contradictionis,</hi> appears upon triall to include alſo a <hi>liberty</hi> of <hi>Contrariety:</hi> and if it may <hi>Not-chooſe</hi> the term commended, then it <hi>may chooſe</hi> the term Forbidden, yea it <hi>muſt chooſe</hi> it, where the terms are Contradictory without a <hi>Medium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All that can be ſaid to help it, will be this; <hi>Willing</hi> and <hi>Suſpending</hi> are indeed Oppoſite Terms; and therefore when the Underſtanding ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeth to <hi>Will,</hi> if the Will do [<hi>Velle] ſuſpendere,</hi> it chooſeth the term Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite, and (conſequently) that which is propoſed as Evill; But (they may ſay perhaps) the Will doth only <hi>Suſpendere,</hi> and not <hi>Velle ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere;</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:130470:37"/>
and ſo this <hi>Suſpending</hi> is not an Object of <hi>Choice,</hi> but only the Abſence or Negation of an Act; and therefore though it doe <hi>ire in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarias partes,</hi> yet it doth not <hi>contrariam partem Eligere,</hi> it doth not <hi>Chooſe,</hi> or <hi>Elect,</hi> the Oppoſite term, becauſe there is no poſitive <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Election</hi> or <hi>Willing</hi> exerciſed about it.</p>
               <p>And this anſwer I confeſſe may ſeem to weaken the Objection im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly foregoing; for thus the Will is not made to <hi>Chooſe</hi> an Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>If they think thus to evade, in ſaying, That this <hi>Liberty</hi> is exerciſed, not in <hi>Suſpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ding</hi> when it might <hi>Act,</hi> becauſe There is no Election, &amp; therefore no Freedom exerciſed; But in <hi>Acting,</hi> when as it might have <hi>Suſpended.</hi> I anſwer, That neither will this ſerve the turn. For as <hi>Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion</hi> is not <hi>Objectum Volitionis,</hi> an Object of Choice; ſo neither is <hi>Acting</hi> an Object of choice. And as we ſay not <hi>Volo Suſpendere,</hi> or <hi>Volo Non-velle,</hi> ſo neither do we ſay <hi>volo Velle:</hi> For by the ſame reaſon that any may ſay <hi>Volo Velle,</hi> he may ſay alſo <hi>volo non Velle.</hi> So that <hi>Willing</hi> can no more be ſaid to be an object of Choice, then <hi>Suſpending.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their <hi>Libertas Contradictionis</hi> therefore muſt either be alſo <hi>ibertas Contrarietatis,</hi> and ſo by themſelves rejected: or elſe it will be no exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, no manifeſtation, of Liberty, and therefore uſeleſſe for their purpoſe.</p>
               <p>I admit (as I ſaid before) the diſtinction in this ſenſe; That the Will, though it cannot <hi>Elect</hi> a Contrary object, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And thus there is no <hi>Action</hi> (of Choice or Deſire) in the Will, but tending to ſome <hi>Good</hi> that the Underſtanding propoſeth; For what is not Known cannot be Deſired: But yet there may be a negligent <hi>Omiſſion</hi> or <hi>Suſpenſion,</hi> when it ought to <hi>Act</hi> Which I do not account <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

(doing or Willing that which ought not) is Poſitive, and therefore cannot proceed from the Will, when the Underſtanding dictates to the contrary. Whereas the Will doth as often fail in <hi>Chooſing</hi> a wrong object, which the Underſtanding acknowledgeth to be <hi>Evill;</hi> as in <hi>Not Chooſing</hi> a <hi>Good</hi> Object.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, it is true, the Will doth often chooſe what it ought not: And yet I affirm, that the Wills Errour is onely Negative and not Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive; It is Omiſſive only, in not-obeying ſome directions of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. I ſhall make it cleer by an Inſtance. <hi>Pleaſure</hi> and <hi>Vertue</hi> may be Competitors, and Rivalls (as it were) both courting the <hi>Will;</hi> (As in an Act Pleaſant, but Sinnefull.)

               <p>If you ſay, the Underſtanding doth indeed diſcover ſome <hi>Good</hi> (though a leſſe Good) in the Object; yet this is not to be accounted the Underſtandings <hi>Practicall Direction (dictamen:)</hi> But, that the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding having examined the Good and the Evill that is in every Act, and comparing them together; upon this Compariſon, as it obſerves the Good or Evill to be more, ſo it preſcribes, <hi>to Doe,</hi> or <hi>Not to Doe, H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

And thus the propoſall of <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> as <hi>Good;</hi> is as truely declarative as the other; and this the Will follows: But a further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, whereby it declares, that although Pleaſure be Good, yet it is Evill to embrace this Good, becauſe there is a greater Evill annexed; This direction, by omiſſion, it imbraceth not.

of the Will to reject: No more then it is in the power of the <hi>Eare</hi> not to be <hi>pleaſed</hi> with harmonious <hi>Muſick;</hi> or in the power of the <hi>Palat,</hi> not to be <hi>delighted</hi> with the <hi>Sweetneſſe</hi> of a <hi>Taſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus I ſuppoſe it may appear, How far, and From what Ground there may be Knowledge without Faith.</p>
               <p>That <hi>God is all mercy and ſweetneſſe to the Divels,</hi> is no Article of my faith, <hi>Thoſe miſerable creatures,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>cannot conſent to it.</hi> No more can I: And yet I deny not, <hi>that Mercy and Juſtice are One thing in God.</hi> Gods Simple Eſſence is the ſame with both; yet are not They ſo properly the ſame with each other. The <hi>Torment</hi> of the Devils proceeds from that Divine Eſſence which is <hi>Love;</hi> (as likewiſe the <hi>Mercies</hi> of Gods Children proceed from that Divine Eſſence which is <hi>Justice:</hi> for the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God is equally <hi>himſelfe</hi> as is his <hi>Love:</hi>) Yet may we not ſay, the <hi>Torments</hi> of thoſe are an effect of <hi>Love,</hi> no more then that the <hi>Mercies</hi> of theſe are the effects of <hi>Anger;</hi> yet Both are the effects of that Simple Eſſence, which is Both. It is a far different thing therefore, to ſay, A Loving God doth notwithſtanding Puniſh; and to ſay, A Loving God doth <hi>therefore</hi> Puniſh: Puniſhment and Revenge are <hi>ſufficiently conſiſtent</hi> with Love; but not the <hi>immediate ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects</hi> of Love. Thus we ſay, <hi>Muſicus Aedificat;</hi> yet not his skill in <hi>Muſick,</hi> but his skill in <hi>Architecture,</hi> is exerciſed in Building.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Love</hi> of God (as likewiſe his Anger, Juſtice, Power, &amp;c.) is (I confeſſe) the <hi>Divine Eſſence;</hi> we allow no <hi>Accidents</hi> in God at all: <hi>quicquid est in Deo, eſt Deus.</hi> But I ask, Whether he think this Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute <hi>Love</hi> (and ſo of the reſt) to be an <hi>Adequate expreſſion</hi> of that whole Eſſence? If ſo, then is it all one to ſay, God <hi>Loves</hi> his Children, and, God is <hi>Angry</hi> with his children, or God <hi>Hates</hi> them: If not, then is it only <hi>inadaequatus conceptus,</hi> and there remains ſomewhat to be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by other Attributes, which is not expreſſed in this. The <hi>Attributes</hi> of God therefore (as likewiſe it is in other <hi>inadaequati conceptus</hi>) may be all affirmed of the ſame <hi>Simple Eſſence;</hi> but not (Mutually) of each other: And the Effects of each may be ſaid to be the Effects of the ſame Eſſence; but not (Promiſcuouſly) of every Attribute: (unleſſe we take them <hi>Materialiter,</hi> not <hi>Formaliter:</hi>) And conſequently, <hi>the ruine</hi> (of the damned) is not (as he affirms) <hi>an effect of infinite ſweetneſſe</hi> (though of that (Eſſence) which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> How Knowledge and Affection differ.</head>
               <p>FRom what hath been ſpoken in the former Chapter, without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any more, may appear what is to be ſaid concerning his Ninth Chapter: How it comes to paſſe that ſome of mean <hi>Knowledge</hi> have Large <hi>Affections.</hi> For a <hi>Speculative</hi> Knowledge doth not alwayes Breed <hi>Affection,</hi> (becauſe the Will doth not alwayes follow the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,) though neither doth it <hi>Extinguiſh</hi> it.</p>
               <p>It is true, there is an <hi>Affection,</hi> which is rather a <hi>Blazing</hi> (then a <hi>Warming,</hi> Enlivening) Love, (as the Fools Mirth like the crackling of Thorns;) Which ariſeth either from a <hi>Falſe Apprehenſion,</hi> or elſe from the <hi>Novelty,</hi> rather then the <hi>ſweetneſſe,</hi> of the Object, (as the Smell of Flowers at the firſt approach doth moſt <hi>Affect the Senſe,</hi> though they be as <hi>Sweet</hi> afterwards;) And This perhaps may vaniſh, at the preſence of a more <hi>Clear</hi> or more <hi>Continued</hi> Light. But the true <hi>Warmth</hi> of <hi>Zeal</hi> is not extinguiſhed by the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> (though Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,) but feeds upon it as Fewell: And the greater Growth there is in (eſpecially Experimentall) Knowledge, the greater is the Strength of Affection from it: And, thus, they that <hi>Know</hi> moſt (experimentally) do alwayes <hi>Love</hi> moſt: Knowledge and Affection go together.</p>
               <p>Yet are we not forced from hence to grant, that <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Affection</hi> are the <hi>Same:</hi> Betwixt which I muſt needs allow the ſame difference (be it more or leſſe, that is, Reall, or Modall) which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> and the <hi>Will:</hi> Knowledge is not Affection, and Affection is not Knowledge.</p>
               <p>And that Objection which his Lordſhip from hence makes to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi>That (ſince men of Largeſt Affections, doe not alwayes Know moſt of God, but ſome of Weaker Affections may Know More;) it might appear from hence, That all Being is not One, differing onely in Degrees; but that there are even different Natures, amongst which one may Excell, while the other is Depreſt:</hi> This Objection, I ſay, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of that force, that I ſee not how all which his Lordſhip brings, can take it away.</p>
               <p>The large <hi>Encomiums,</hi> which he brings for <hi>Affectionate</hi> Knowledge, preferring it before <hi>Speculative,</hi> (which he proſecutes very Piouſly, very Judiciouſly, very Affectionately;) though it prove, That <hi>Affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> Knowledge is the <hi>more Excellent;</hi> Yet doth it not ſhew That <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative</hi> Knowledge is <hi>Nothing;</hi> or That the <hi>Meaſure</hi> of <hi>Affection</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:130470:39"/>
follows the <hi>Meaſure</hi> of <hi>Speculative Knowledge:</hi> One of which he ought to have proved, if he conclude that <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Affection</hi> are the <hi>Same.</hi> A man may truly <hi>Know,</hi> that <hi>Sugar</hi> is Sweet, though he neither <hi>Taſt</hi> its Sweetneſſe, nor be <hi>Delighted</hi> or Pleaſed with that Taſt. And a Chriſtian is ſometimes to live by Faith and not by Senſe; That is, he is to Truſt, and Reſt upon the Speculative Knowledge of Gods Goodneſſe, and his own Intereſt in it; even then when for the preſent he wants the Senſe of it. He may <hi>Know</hi> and <hi>Beleeve</hi> that the Lord is Good, though he doe not <hi>Tast</hi> and <hi>See</hi> it. <hi>I will wait upon God</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iſay) which hath Hid his Face from the Houſe Iſrael.</hi> He that <hi>walketh in darkneſſe, and Sees no Light,</hi> muſt yet <hi>Truſt in the Name of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>And thus much for the firſt Notion of Truth, or <hi>Reaſon,</hi> as it is the groundwork of <hi>Rationall Operations.</hi> In which, thus far I may go along with his Lordſhip, That <hi>Reaſon</hi> is but the <hi>Soul Intelligent;</hi> That <hi>Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But, whether <hi>Place and Time be</hi> any thing or <hi>nothing,</hi> whether <hi>they alter</hi> any thing or <hi>nothing in this point;</hi> Yet ſure we are that <hi>This</hi> Man is not the <hi>Other</hi> Man. <hi>This</hi> Soule not <hi>Another</hi> Soule, <hi>This Action</hi> is not the <hi>Other Action:</hi> And ſo the difficulty remains as hard; there will be <hi>various</hi> Operations ſtill.</p>
               <p>He brings ſeverall <hi>Simile's</hi> to illuſtrate it. <hi>Complexion Lineaments, Harmony, though they be in themſelves Diverſe, yet they make up One pleaſing Being, which we call Beauty. A Flame ariſing from divers Thorns is but One Flame. A Stream ſupplied from ſeverall Springs, is but One Stream.</hi> I may adde, <hi>Many</hi> Members make up <hi>One</hi> Body; <hi>Many</hi> Creatures <hi>One</hi> World. (Yet ſtill One Member is not the Other; The water received from One Spring, is not the ſame water which came from the Other Spring, though both runne in the ſame Channell.)</p>
               <p>But will he ſay, <hi>So is it in our caſe?</hi> That (in the ſame manner) <hi>ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Acts</hi> doe conſtitute <hi>One Soule?</hi> Are theſe Actions its <hi>Integrall Parts,</hi> as the Members are of the Body; and ſeverall Waters of One Stream? &amp;c. Are they <hi>a Piece of the Whole and make up the totum Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitum?</hi> Then is the Soule Diviſible; Then doth it loſe ſome part of it ſelfe, and becomes maimed at the ceſſation of every Action.</p>
               <p>But he makes not the Soule perhaps to be conſtituted of theſe <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> as ſo many <hi>Integrall Parts;</hi> But, ſaith he, <hi>The Soule is One Act, diſtinguiſhed to our Notton by ſeverall apparitions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If ſo, then his <hi>Simile's</hi> drawn from Integrall Parts conſtituting the whole <hi>Compoſitum,</hi> will not hold.</p>
               <p>But (ſecondly) I deny that all theſe <hi>Operations</hi> are but <hi>one Action</hi> in <hi>various Shapes.</hi> They are all Actions of the <hi>ſame Soule,</hi> but they are not all the <hi>ſame Action.</hi> The Soule, If you will may be called, <hi>One Soule</hi> under <hi>Various Shapes;</hi> But theſe <hi>Various Shapes</hi> cannot be ſaid to be <hi>One Shape.</hi> Like as Wax faſhioned ſucceſſively in ſeveral Moulds, is the <hi>ſame Wax</hi> in ſeverall <hi>Figures;</hi> but that theſe are all the <hi>Same Figure,</hi> we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay. Actions performed by the ſame Soule, are all <hi>Modi</hi> of the <hi>Same Thing,</hi> of the ſame Soule; but they are not all the <hi>ſame Modus.</hi> This is not the Other.</p>
               <p>And this we may hold, whatever become of <hi>Time and Place</hi> for this Diſtinction ariſeth not from Them. A man is the ſame Man <hi>to day,</hi> that

He is the ſame Man at <hi>York,</hi> that he was at <hi>London,</hi> though the <hi>Place</hi> be not the ſame. <hi>Time and Place</hi> doe neither make the <hi>Same</hi> to be <hi>Two,</hi> nor <hi>Two</hi> to be the <hi>Same; One</hi> to be <hi>Two,</hi> nor <hi>Two</hi> to be <hi>One:</hi> Yet what hinders but that Things and Actions may have an Intrinſicall Difference one from another.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The next Objection, Concerning the nature of <hi>Evill,</hi> is of leſſe force againſt his Tenet. For, That <hi>Good and Evill may coexiſt in One entire Act;</hi> That there may be ſome Degrees of Goodneſſe in an Action, and yet not that Perfection of Goodneſſe, that ought to be; may as well be granted, as That <hi>the Twilight hath not [So much] Light, and [So much] poſitive darkneſſe, but that it hath not ſo [Much] Light as the Midday.</hi> But yet in the mean time it may be doubted, whether the Nature of <hi>Evill</hi> be meerly <hi>Privative.</hi> It is true indeed, The nature of (Moral) Evill is a <hi>Non-conformity</hi> (or Difformity rather) to Gods Law: But why may not this <hi>non-conformity</hi> ariſe <hi>ex praeſentiâ non debiti,</hi> as well as <hi>ex ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiâ debiti,</hi> or <hi>ex defectu debiti ineſſe?</hi> May not a Line diſagree from its meaſure, by being too Long, as well as by being too Short?

But I ſtand not now to decide it: You ſhall find more of it in the next chapter.</p>
               <p>But that which is aſſumed as a ground of this Aſſertion, is farre more improbable then the Aſſertion it ſelfe. <hi>viz. That Contradictions may be ſimul, ſemel, &amp; eodem reſpectu, in the ſame Subject.</hi>

                  <hi>Farther</hi> Degree, are no Contradictions, becauſe they are not <hi>ad idem.</hi> And ſuch a Coexiſtence <hi>Aristotle</hi> and his followers will not deny; Elſe how can they ſpeak of <hi>Qualitates Remiſſae?</hi> Nay more, They will grant an <hi>Inferiour Degree,</hi> to conſiſt, not only with the Negation of a <hi>Farther Degree,</hi> but even with the Preſence of its <hi>Contrary;</hi> For they deny not but that there may be <hi>Contrary</hi> qualities in the ſame Subject <hi>in Remiſſis gradibus,</hi> (as Heat and Cold in warm water, though not <hi>in gradibus Intenſis.</hi>

               <p>He toucheth laſtly, upon <hi>Copernicus</hi> his Opinion, <hi>Which,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>hath been confuted theſe many yeares by the three leading Senſes.</hi> (And yet his margent ſaith, that <hi>ſenſe is confuted by Him.) For we [See] the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions of the Heavens: we [Feel] our ſelves upon a ſtable Foundation; We [Heare] not from the Volutations of the Earth ſuch a black Cant as her heavy rowlings would rumble forth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But (not to dispute the truth of <hi>Copernicus</hi> his Opinion) I think I may affirm that <hi>Neither</hi> of theſe Teſtimonies of <hi>Senſe</hi> do any way contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict his Aſſertion.

is all:) But whether this <hi>diverſity of Poſition</hi> ariſe from the <hi>Motion</hi> of the One, or the Other, or Both, our Sight determins not; Affirming only That there is ſuch a diverſe Poſiture. <hi rend="sup">2</hi> Our ſenſe of [<hi>Feeling</hi>] aſſures us of thus much, That the Earth is ſuch a Foundation as upon which we reſt; and, that we remain in the ſame Poſiture in reſpect of the Earth and the Air circumſtant; Which may be as well if all jointly <hi>Move</hi> together, as if all jointly <hi>stand ſtill.</hi> A man in a Ship under Hatches up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſmooth water, ſuppoſeth himſelfe to ſit faſt upon his Seat, (and he doth ſo;) and he ſeeth all things about him to remain at the ſame Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, in the ſame Poſiture, diſcerning no alteration: Yet this hinders not but that He and They may be joyntly moved Together, without being thrown from off his ſeat, upon which he may ſit as firm as if he were on ſhore. And <hi rend="sup">3</hi> for the ſenſe of [<hi>Hearing,</hi>] I ſee no reaſon, why it ſhould be more blamed for not hearing the ſound of the <hi>Earths Voluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> then for not hearing the <hi>Pythagorian Harmony.</hi> If the vaſt <hi>Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall Spheres,</hi> whoſe almoſt every Starre doth farre exceed the Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriall Globe, be whirled about with ſuch a ſilent motion, as that the quickeſt Eare cannot diſcern it; Why may not the <hi>Earth,</hi> a farreleſſer body, paſſe as quietly, without ſuch a diſmall <hi>Cant,</hi> ſuch an hideous Noiſe, as his Lordſhip doth ſuppoſe? For Noiſe doth not ariſe meerly from <hi>Motion;</hi> but from the <hi>Croſſing</hi> or <hi>Thwarting</hi> of ſeverall motions, from the Claſhing and <hi>Colliſion</hi> of one Body againſt another, by reaſon that the One (<hi>ſtanding</hi>) interrupts the Other in its <hi>Motion,</hi> or Both mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving according to <hi>ſeverall motions</hi> do mutually hinder each others pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe: Whereas, if all moved the <hi>ſame Way,</hi> with the <hi>ſame Speed,</hi> (as is ſuppoſed in the Motion of the Earth, and the things adjoyning) there would be no ſuch Claſhing, or Interruption of one another, and (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently) no <hi>Noiſe.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Senſes</hi> Teſtimony therefore doth not contradict the Opinion of <hi>Copernicus,</hi> The <hi>Eye</hi> tells us, that the Starres and We are at ſeverall times in ſeverall Poſitures, but, whether it proceed from Their motion or from Ours, it affirmeth not.

                  </gap>aſeth to Act Truth.</head>
               <p>IN the twelfth Chapter, he comes to another Objection <hi>If Actings of Truth, be Truth,</hi> (that is, if Rationall Operations be the Soule, the Soules Eſſence) <hi>then when the Soule Acteth not Truth, it ceaſeth to Bee: and ſo when it entertaineth or pronounceth a Falſe Poſition, the Soule is no more it ſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Objection I conceive to have two branches; For the Soule may ceaſe to <hi>act Truth,</hi> either by <hi>Not acting</hi> at all, or by <hi>acting Falſly.</hi> For whether it <hi>act Not,</hi> or <hi>act Falſly,</hi> it ceaſeth to <hi>act Truth;</hi> and therefore (if acting of Truth be its Eſſence) it ceaſeth to <hi>Bee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His firſt Anſwer may be equally applied to both; That, <hi>granting the Soule when it acts upon Falſhood, to be as when it acteth not, and ſo is not; Yet ſhall we advance nothing, till we prove the Succeſſion of Moments to be Reall and not Imaginary.</hi> Where he preſuppoſeth, that when it <hi>Acteth not,</hi> then it <hi>Is not;</hi> and, though the ſame be granted in a <hi>Falſe</hi> acting, yet neither That, nor This, will prove of any force, ſince <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Moments</hi> is onely <hi>Imaginary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ground of this Reply, I conceive to be this; If there be not any <hi>Reall</hi> Succeſſion, If there be no <hi>prius</hi> and <hi>poſterius</hi> Indeed, but be onely <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> ſo to be by our Imagination; Then any <hi>One</hi> Act of the Soule, is able to give it a co-exiſtence to all Eternity: (according to what he affirmed in the former Chapter.) For of this <hi>One</hi> Act, being Reall, it cannot be affirmed, That it <hi>Was</hi> but <hi>Is not,</hi> or it <hi>Is</hi> but hath <hi>not-been;</hi> but if it <hi>at all</hi> Be, it muſt Be <hi>alwayes;</hi> Becauſe, if <hi>Succeſsion</hi> be onely <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary,</hi> then to <hi>Be</hi> and to <hi>Have been</hi> is all one; then there was not a time when it <hi>Was not,</hi> neither will there be a time when it <hi>Shall Not be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if the Iſſue of the Queſtion depend upon this, Whether Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be Reall, or Imaginary; I doubt not but this might be ſoon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided.</p>
               <p>Therefore Firſt, I ask, Whether there be not the ſame reaſon for <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion</hi> in Time, that is for <hi>Extenſion</hi> in Place? Whether there may be <hi>Pars extra Partem, Punctum extra Punctum,</hi> though not <hi>Momentum
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:130470:46"/>
extra Momentum;</hi> or there be the ſame reaſon of <hi>Both,</hi> and Both be <hi>Imaginary?</hi> If there be in Both the ſame reaſon, (which I ſuppoſe he he will affirm;) Then muſt every <hi>Being</hi> have a Coexiſtence to <hi>all Places,</hi> as well as a Coexiſtence to <hi>all Times;</hi> It muſt have an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>biquity</hi> as well as a <hi>Perpetuity.</hi> Then is it in vain to diſpute Whether <hi>Chriſts Body</hi> be Really preſent in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> Whether <hi>Peter</hi> were ever at <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp;c. If every Body, every Thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be every where. For if <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Place</hi> be nothing, then that which hath a reall exiſtence in <hi>any</hi> place, hath a reall exiſtence in <hi>all</hi> places; becauſe <hi>This</hi> place and all <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> places have only an <hi>Imaginary</hi> Difference, and are <hi>indeed</hi> all one.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> If ſo, then what is the difference between an <hi>Act</hi> of Sinning, and a <hi>Courſe</hi> of Sinning? What is the difference between the <hi>Once</hi> committing of a ſinful Act, and the <hi>Oft</hi> Reiterating of it? Between <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids One Act</hi> of Adultery, and the laſcivious perſons <hi>Constant Practiſe?</hi> Why are we exhorted to <hi>Ceaſe from evill;</hi> if every Act be Eternall, and whatſoever ſucceeds can be but the Same? <hi>He that ſtole, let him ſteal no more:</hi> To what end ſerves this counſell, if there be no other Act fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zible, but what Is already, and That to remain for ever?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. If you would ſay, That the ſame Act is again Reiterated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> I ask, if the <hi>Iteration</hi> be ſomwhat more then the <hi>first Commiſsion?</hi> If not, then to commit it <hi>Once,</hi> and to Iterate it <hi>often,</hi> is all One: If it be ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more, then is it either a Reall addition, or Imaginary: If <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary,</hi> then are we where we were before; If it be <hi>Reall,</hi> then why may there not be a reall <hi>act</hi> diſtinct from the former, as well as a reall <hi>Commiſsion</hi> (of the Same act) diſtinct from the former? Thus you ſee if Time be Nothing, If Succeſſion be only Imaginary; then is it all one to commit Many ſinnes, and to commit One Sinne.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if Succeſſion and Difference of Moments be onely Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, if all Duration be Eternall, all Simultaneous; Then what is the difference between the <hi>long life</hi> of the Aged, and the <hi>few days</hi> of him that dy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For I am as really there as he is: For if I be any where, then am I There, ſince <hi>There</hi> and <hi>Here</hi> are al one; Time and Place making only an <hi>Imaginary</hi> (and not Reall) <hi>difference.</hi>

               <p>So that if Succeſſion of <hi>Time</hi> be only Imaginary; Then do we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready know, whatſoever we ſhall know, (whereas <hi>Christ</hi> himſelfe <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed</hi> in wiſdom, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.)

               <p>His ſecond anſwer, to the Objection propounded in the beginning of this Chapter, toucheth not at all the firſt Branch of it, wherein it is objected, That <hi>if particular Actings of Truth, be Truth,</hi> or the Soules Eſſence, How is it that the Underſtanding ſhould not <hi>ceaſe to Be, when it ceaſeth to Work;</hi> (for this in his firſt Anſwer he ſeemed to grant:) But it is applyed to the ſecond Branch of it, <hi>viz. That If particular Actings of Truth be Truth,</hi> or the Soules Eſſence, <hi>then the Soule enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a Falſe poſition ſhould be no more it ſelfe.</hi> To which he anſwers, By denying <hi>that the Soule doth at all act upon Falſhood:</hi> and that upon this ground, Becauſe <hi>Falſhood is not a Reall Being upon which the Soule can work. For its nature being Privative, and no Reall Being, how can the Soule or Truth work upon Nothing?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I might anſwer here, That it is not requiſite to the Soules Act, that its Object ſhould have <hi>a Reall being:</hi> (As appears by the Soules appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending <hi>Ens rationis;</hi> which Apprehenſion is a <hi>poſitive Act,</hi> and yet hath no <hi>Reall Object.</hi>) For the Object of Intellection, is not <hi>Reale,</hi> but <hi>Cognoſcibile.</hi> And therefore, That Falſhood wanteth a <hi>reall being,</hi> is not inough to ſhew, that the Underſtanding cannot work upon it.</p>
               <p>And this (in effect) he granteth ſoon after. For, it being Objected, that <hi>the Soule while it pronounceth a Falſe poſition, doth Really act, (verè agere;</hi> He replyes, That <hi>there are in this Action two things, a Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a So-thinking. To think is a poſitive Action, a good Action, But the formalis ratio of So-thinking lyeth in Thinking an Errour, which is Nothing; and ſo a Not-thinking. When (miſtaking) a man catcheth at a ſhadow; In catching he doth truly Act; But to Catch a Shaddow, is to catch nothing; Now to catch nothing, and not to catch; to act nothing, and not to act, is all one. So to Think is Reall, but to Think Amiſſe is No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and all one with Not-thinking.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Now this being premiſed, let us examine the truth of ſome Tenents which are allmoſt generally received by all.</p>
               <p>1 The nature of <hi>Evill,</hi> ſay they, is <hi>Privative,</hi> not Poſitive; <hi>Evill is Nothing.</hi> And why?

                  </hi> If it be, then how can it be contrary to the other? Since that Nothing cannot be oppoſite to Nothing, but Something to Something, or Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to Nothing.</p>
               <p>I ſay therefore, that <hi>Metaphyſicall Evill,</hi> is meerly Privative, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oppoſite to the Goodneſſe of Being; and it is no other but <hi>Non-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> But <hi>Morall Evill</hi> is every way as Poſitive as is Morall Good.</p>
               <p>For what is the nature of <hi>Morall</hi> Good, or Evill? is it not, a <hi>Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,</hi> or a <hi>Difformity</hi> to a Morall Precept? Then the Goodneſſe or Evill of it is not in the <hi>Being</hi> of the Action, but in the <hi>ſo Being;</hi> It lies not in the Poſitive or Abſolute Entity of the Action, but in the Relative nature. Morall Goodneſſe therefore, and Morall Evill, have not an Abſolute Eſſence, but a Relative; An <hi>Agreeing,</hi> or <hi>Diſagreeing;</hi> a Likeneſſe, or Unlikeneſſe, to its Rule. Now if <hi>Likeneſſe</hi> be a Reall Relation; why may not <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlikeneſſe</hi> be alſo a relation Reall? If <hi>Simile</hi> be Reall, why not <hi>Diſſimile?</hi> If the One be Poſitive, why not the Other?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> They will ſay perhaps, That the nature of Morall Evill, is not a <hi>Difformity</hi> but a <hi>non-Conformity,</hi> to its Rule; not to be (poſitively) <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlike,</hi> but only <hi>Not to be Like.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If ſo, then <hi>not to be</hi> is a Sinne; for <hi>not to Bee,</hi> includes <hi>not to be Like,</hi> or <hi>not to be Obedient.</hi> If the bleſſed Angels had never been Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they had been <hi>eo ipſo</hi> Sinfull: For if they had never Been, they muſt of neceſſity <hi>Not be Obedient;</hi> (though not <hi>Diſobedient;</hi>) For how can they <hi>be Obedient,</hi> if not at all <hi>Being?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Stone muſt then be Sinfull, when it doth <hi>not-underſtand</hi> the Nature of God, as a man doth and ought to do; For though it be not <hi>Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient</hi> to the precept of Knowledge, (becauſe this precept was not made to a Stone but to Man,) Yet you cannot ſay that it is <hi>Obedient,</hi> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

               <p>God commanded <hi>Moſes</hi> to go down into <hi>Egipt,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Aaron</hi> to offer Sacrifice: Doe I Sinne therefore when I doe not-obey this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand made to them? How is it poſſible that I can obey the command for <hi>Moſes</hi> his Journey, or <hi>Aaron's</hi> ſacrificing; for <hi>My</hi> going is not <hi>Moſes</hi> his going, nor is <hi>my</hi> ſacrificing, <hi>Aaron's</hi> Sacrificing; Yet doe I not ſinne in <hi>not-obeying.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Moſes</hi> made the <hi>Brazen Serpent,</hi> he did not (in that) obey the precept of going into <hi>Egipt,</hi> (for to go into Egipt, and to make the Serpent, is not the ſame,) Yet was it not Sinfull to make the Brazen Serpent, though it were-not an Obedience to that Command, for neither was it a Diſobedience; for that Precept, did neither injoyn nor forbid it.</p>
               <p>Thus every Action, though never ſo Good, will be a Sinne; For there is in the moſt perfect Act, a <hi>not-Obeying</hi> of many precepts, (yea of all precepts, except that which injoyns this Action,) though there be not perhaps a <hi>Diſobedience</hi> of any.</p>
               <p>The nature of Sinne therefore, or Morall Evill, is not barely a <hi>Not-Obeying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Therefore the Stone ſins not, becauſe there is no <hi>Diſobedience</hi> in its <hi>not-Knowing,</hi> becauſe it was not Commanded; <hi>Moſes</hi> his making the brazen Serpent, was not a Breach of his former Injunction, although not an Obeying of it; for in his Commiſſion to go into Egipt, his making the brazen Serpent was neither Forbidden nor Commanded. The Act of one Morall Virtue, is not an offence againſt the reſt; for it is no Breach of their Rules, though it be not an Obſervance of them: It is <hi>Praeter,</hi> but not <hi>Contra.</hi>

But if I ſhould ſay on the contrary, That the nature of Morall <hi>Good,</hi> were not a <hi>Conformity,</hi> or poſitive Likeneſſe; but only a <hi>not-Difformity,</hi> a <hi>not-Diſagreeing,</hi> or not croſſing its Rule; Might not this be ſaid with as good probability as the other? You would think it ſtrange perhaps, that <hi>Evill</hi> ſhould be Poſitive, and <hi>Good</hi> Negative: But (if I m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Law, there is no Sinne. If I walk for my refreſhing in one part of the Garden to day, and in another to morrow; or in that other to day, &amp; in this to morrow; I ſinne not in either: Not becauſe I have a <hi>Command</hi> to walk in this firſt, or in the other part firſt: But becauſe neither is <hi>Forbidden,</hi> therefore is neither <hi>

Now, what is the <hi>Lawfullneſſe</hi> of an Action, but its <hi>Morall Goodneſſe?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 3 Yet Thirdly, I affirm not the nature of morall <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Evill</hi> to be <hi>Negative,</hi> but both equally Poſitive; If by <hi>Good,</hi> you underſtand, That which <hi>Ought</hi> to be, not, That which <hi>May</hi> be. And therefore I make three ſorts of Morall Beings; <hi>Bonum, Malum, Indifferens<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Good, which <hi>muſt</hi> be done; Indifferent, which <hi>may</hi> be done; Evill, which <hi>may-not</hi> be done. The firſt, Commanded; the laſt, Forbidden; the other, of a midle nature, neither Commanded, nor Forbidden; which being Indifferent, is often called <hi>Good,</hi> but never <hi>Evill.</hi> The firſt conſiſts, in a <hi>Conformity</hi> to its Rule; the laſt, in a <hi>Difformity;</hi> the other in a bare <hi>not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſagreeing.</hi> The firſt and laſt are of a Poſitive nature; the other of a Negative. (And yet ſometimes this <hi>Poſitiveneſſe,</hi> whether in Good or Evill, is rather <hi>Poſitivum Logicum</hi> (the Praedicat of a Poſitive or Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative Propoſition,) then <hi>Poſitivum Reale.</hi> For an <hi>Omiſſion, Negatio act<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s,</hi> may be Good or Evill: which having in it ſelfe no reall Being, cannot be the Subject of a reall Relation.)</p>
               <p>Yet doth not this contradict their Opinion who affirm, That <hi>non da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur actio Indifferens in individuo.</hi> For by Good and Evill, they mean <hi>Licitum &amp; Illicitum,</hi> Lawfull and Unlawfull; including under the name of <hi>Good,</hi> or <hi>Lawfull,</hi> not only that which <hi>Ought</hi> to be done, but whatſoever <hi>May</hi> be done; as when (in civill matters) we ſay, it is <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> for me to give ſuch a portion of my Eſtate to ſuch a Man, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Law of the Kingdom <hi>Injoins</hi> me ſo to doe; but becauſe it doth not Inhibite me. And thus <hi>Licitum</hi> will be a Negative term, and <hi>Illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citum</hi> a Poſitive, (though by the Grammaticall Notation it might ſeem contrary;) for <hi>Illicitum</hi> affirms, that there is a Law to the Contrary; <hi>Licitum</hi> denies only that there is ſuch a Law to Forbid it, but whether there be any to Command it, it affirms not.</p>
               <p>And thus much concerning the nature of Evill. (Wherein if I may ſeem prolix, it being but a Digreſſion in this place: Yet becauſe I was called to it in the former chapter, where his Lordſhip gave me occaſion
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:130470:49"/>
to handle it; I thought it more fit to referre the diſcuſſing of it to this place, where I meet with more queſtions of the like nature.)</p>
               <p>2. Now, as it is in <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> ſo alſo in <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Falſhood. Falſhood,</hi> ſaith he, is <hi>a Vanity, a Lye, a Nothing</hi> And why ſo? Becauſe <hi>Ens &amp; Verum convertuntur,</hi> and therefore <hi>Falſum</hi> muſt be <hi>non-Ens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I ſay, as to the former; Truth of <hi>Being,</hi> or <hi>Metaphyſicall</hi> Truth, is Poſitive, and of the ſame extent or latitude with <hi>Entity,</hi> or Being. And this <hi>Truth</hi> I have formerly ſaid to be <hi>Cognoſcibility,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Verum</hi> in this Metaphyſicall acceptation to be all one with <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligibile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I affirm alſo, that <hi>Ens &amp; Verum</hi> (or <hi>Intelligibile) convertuntur.</hi> And (conſequently) according to the manner of <hi>Being,</hi> muſt be the manner of <hi>Intellection.</hi> That which hath a <hi>reall</hi> Being (as <hi>Ens Reale</hi>) may be <hi>Known</hi> to Be; that which hath an <hi>apparent,</hi> or <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> Being, may be <hi>Suppoſed</hi> to Be.</p>
               <p>I affirm likewiſe, that <hi>Falſhood</hi> in this ſenſe cannot be <hi>underſtood,</hi> or that <hi>the Soule cannot act upon</hi> (Metaphyſicall) <hi>Falſhood:</hi> For how can that be Known, which is not <hi>Cognoſcible;</hi> or Underſtood, which is not <hi>Intelligible?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, When I affirm, that <hi>Verum</hi> and <hi>Ens</hi> are Convertible; I reſtrain it not to <hi>Reall Entity;</hi> For there may be <hi>Eſſe Cognitum,</hi> where there is not <hi>Eſſe Reale:</hi> But I proportion its <hi>Cognoſcibility</hi> to its <hi>Being;</hi> and therefore if it have not a <hi>Reall</hi> Being, but only <hi>Imaginary;</hi> it may be <hi>Suppoſed,</hi> but cannot be <hi>Known,</hi> to be.</p>
               <p>Neither yet doe I <hi>So</hi> proportion the reality of Intellection, to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of the Object, as if when there is no Reall Object, there could be no Reall Act: For it is <hi>Cognoſcibile</hi> that is convertible with <hi>Ens,</hi> and hath its reality proportionable to the reality of Being; not <hi>Cognoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But now <hi>Logicall Truth,</hi> the Truth of a <hi>Propoſition,</hi> which is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to <hi>Falſhood,</hi>

               <p>Logicall <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Falſhood</hi> (like as Morall <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evill</hi>) have not an Abſolute Being, but Relative. They conſiſt not in the <hi>Being</hi> or <hi>Not-Being</hi> of the Act; (For when the Underſtanding doth act <hi>Falſly</hi> it doth <hi>verè Agere,</hi> though not <hi>agere Verè;</hi> it is <hi>verè Actus,</hi> though not <hi>Verus Actus:</hi>) but in the <hi>Agreeing,</hi> or <hi>Diſagreeing</hi> with the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. For when the Intellect doth Underſtand, it frames an <hi>Idea,</hi> a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, or repreſentation of the Thing underſtood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which Picture, or <hi>Idea,</hi> is a <hi>Reall</hi> Picture, (it hath the Truth of Being) whether it have the Truth of Repreſentation or not; that is, whether it be Like or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, whether it Agree or Diſagree, with the copy or object which it repreſents. A Picture in a Painters Shop is truly a <hi>Picture,</hi> it hath reall Colours and Lineaments; But perhaps it is a <hi>Falſe</hi> Picture, it repreſents not that Viſage by which it was drawn. When the Underſtanding conceives an <hi>Ens rationis,</hi> the <hi>Idea</hi> or <hi>Conceptus</hi> is not this Imaginary Being, (for this Conception is as Reall as the Conception of a Reall <hi>Ens,</hi>) But the <hi>ſuppoſed Object</hi> of this Conception; there being indeed no ſuch thing as this <hi>Conceptus</hi> doth repreſent. When a Painter deſcribes in a Table ſome Antick Shapes or ſtrange <hi>Chimaera's;</hi> his Deſcription, his Draught, is not a Fiction, but as Reall as the true Pourtraicture of a living Man: But that which by this deſcription is repreſented, <hi>that</hi> is the Fiction, there being no ſuch Antick Forms, no ſuch <hi>Chimaera's,</hi> as he expreſſeth. When the Underſtanding draws a Reall Picture, a reall <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi> or <hi>Conceptus,</hi> without a Copy, without a Pattern; it is <hi>Ens rationis:</hi> When, indeavouring to imitate a Copy, to repreſent the nature of things, the Truth of Being; it yet miſſeth of it, not making its Picture agreeable to its Pattern; this is a <hi>Falſe Apprehenſion.</hi> And this is the difference between <hi>Ens rationis,</hi> and <hi>Error Intellectûs:</hi> Both in the mean time being <hi>reall Acts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Logicall</hi> Truth and Falſhood of a Conception or Propoſition, are but Relations of Likeneſſe or Unlikeneſſe, Conformity or Diffor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, in the Act to its Object; and are both <hi>founded</hi> in the Reality of the Action, or its Truth of Being: And are both equally Reall, equally Poſitive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For Falſhood is not a meer <hi>not-Conformity,</hi> or <hi>not-expreſſing</hi> of things exiſtent; But a <hi>Difformity,</hi> a Croſſing or Thwarting of them. For elſe, when a man <hi>ceaſeth</hi> to Think or Speak of this or that Truth, he

there by <hi>Erres,</hi> and <hi>Lyes:</hi> For when he Thinks not <hi>at all,</hi> he cannot think <hi>Conformably;</hi> when he Speaks not <hi>at all,</hi> he cannot ſpeak <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formally,</hi> either to the Exiſtence of Things, or to his own Opinion of them. Yea every Propoſition, every Thought will have ſo many Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods in it, as there be other Truths which it doth not expreſſe: For if the not-expreſſing of a Truth, be Falſhood: then to affirm that the Sunne ſhines, is a Falſhood, becauſe it doth not expreſſe the Fires hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> If you ſay (to avoid this) that it is not the not-expreſſing of <hi>One</hi> Truth, the not-conformity to <hi>One</hi> Exiſtence, that makes a Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition Falſe; but the not-expreſſing of <hi>Any</hi> Truth: whereas the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to, and the Expreſſing of any Truth, makes the Propoſition or Conception True:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer firſt, that this is contrary to the generall Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which affirms, that <hi>Perfectio oritur ex Integris, Imperfectio verò ex Particulari defectu:</hi> Which is applyed to ſeverall kinds of Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; That <hi>Action</hi> is Good, whoſe <hi>every</hi> Circumſtance is rightly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; That <hi>Propoſition</hi> True<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whoſe <hi>every</hi> Branch doth agree with the Thing, &amp;c.

               <p>2. Again, If there be requiſite a not-expreſſing of <hi>Any</hi> Truth to make it <hi>Falſe;</hi> then muſt this (and the like propoſitions) be True, if I affirm <hi>Virgil &amp; Homer</hi> to be Greek Poets, If I affirm a <hi>Stone</hi> to be a <hi>Reaſonable Creature:</hi> For it expreſſeth One Truth, <hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>
                  <hi>Logicall Falſhood</hi> therfore is as poſitive, as Logicall <hi>Truth;</hi> the one conſiſting in a poſitive Conformity, the other in a poſitive Difformity to the Things.

               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:130470:51"/>Neither can there be a <hi>Medium</hi> between <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Falſhood,</hi> as there is between <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evill;</hi> For though there may be an <hi>Indifferent Action,</hi> which is neither <hi>Good</hi> (poſitively) nor <hi>Evill;</hi> yet is there not an <hi>Indifferent Propoſition</hi> which is neither True nor Falſe. <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Falſhood</hi> in Propoſitions, are oppoſed as <hi>Lawfulneſſe</hi> and <hi>

                  <hi>Goodneſſe</hi> of <hi>Being</hi> (Metaphyſicall <hi>goodneſſe</hi>) is but a common Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject capable either of (Phyſicall) <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Evill;</hi> (like as the ſame <hi>Reall</hi> Action may be <hi>Morally</hi> Good or Evill.) And according as the <hi>Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> Good, or Evill (annexed to Being <hi>Metaphyſically</hi> Good) doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, ſo is that Being <hi>Deſirable,</hi> or <hi>not Deſirable.</hi> Otherwiſe, How could it be <hi>better for that man</hi> (which betrayed our Saviour) <hi>that he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been born?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I urge not the judgement of <hi>Senſe</hi> in this particular; becauſe his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip appeals from Senſe to Reaſon: I ſhall therefore examine what <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> can alledge, why credit ſhould not be given to the judgement of Senſe. For, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>having a Judgement confeſſed in the Court of <hi>Senſe;</hi> I muſt ſuppoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it to be in force, till ſuch time as I ſee it revoked by <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:</hi> And when Reaſon hath reverſed it, I will grant the former Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to be Voyd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> You will ſay <hi>Being,</hi> though Miſerable, hath <hi>ſome</hi> Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: whereas <hi>Not-Being</hi> hath <hi>none:</hi> and therefore <hi>Being,</hi> though with <hi>Miſery,</hi> is more <hi>deſirable.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But if this ſatisfie not; I deſire to know whether there be not the ſame ſtrength of Reaſon in This Argument, that is in Theirs. <hi>viz:</hi> A <hi>Sinfull Act</hi> hath in it the Goodneſſe of <hi>Being;</hi> and its <hi>Sinfullneſſe</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> only a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of <hi>further</hi> Goodneſſe, the goodneſſe of <hi>Conformity</hi> to Gods Law. Therefore, it is better to <hi>Sinne</hi> then <hi>not to Act;</hi> to commit a Sinne then not to commit it: For if I <hi>Sinne,</hi> I produce <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ome Good; becauſe
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:130470:52"/>
it is a reall Action, and ſo hath the Goodneſſe of Being; But in <hi>not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting,</hi> not-committing, I produce <hi>no</hi> Goodneſſe at all. Therefore it is better to Sinne, then not to Sinne: becauſe <hi>Acting,</hi> though Sinfull, hath <hi>Some</hi> good, but <hi>Not-acting</hi> hath <hi>None.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if this Argument do not hold good to prove it <hi>Better to Sinne</hi> (be the Sinne as great as can be poſſible) <hi>then not to Act, not to Sinne:</hi> Then muſt I needs think that their Argument, being exactly in the ſame form, is of as little force, to prove <hi>Miſery</hi> (though never ſo great) <hi>to be better then not-Being.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let us heare his Lordſhip plead at <hi>Reaſons</hi> Barre, for the revoking that Sentence which hath paſt in the Court of <hi>Senſe. Reaſon telleth us</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that Paine must be Somthing, or Nothing: If Nothing, then it is but a Privation; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>f Something, then muſt it be Good or Evill; If Good, it cannot hurt us; If Evill, it is either a Nominall Evill, or Reall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med an Evill and is not, it will not be diſputed; but if it be a Reall Evill, then is it Nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for Evill is only a Privation of Good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer to this diſcourſe; That <hi>Paine</hi> is <hi>Somthing,</hi> It is <hi>Evill,</hi> It is a <hi>Reall</hi> Evill, <hi>(Malum Phyſicum.)</hi> And this Reall Evill is alſo <hi>Poſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>There is one great rubbe that yet remains againſt what I have ſaid, concerning theſe three laſt mentioned Queſtions; which I have refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the End, that ſo once mentioning might ſuffice, without parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular repetition in the diſcuſſing of each Queſtion. And it is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If Falſhood and Evill,</hi> whether Morall or Phyſicall, <hi>have a Being,</hi> (if it be Reall) <hi>then muſt we with the Manichees make two Sources of Being; or elſe God muſt be the Author of it, which none will affirm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For anſwer to this, I intend not <hi>ex profeſſo</hi> to handle at large that queſtion, <hi>Whether,</hi> and <hi>In what Senſe,</hi> God may be called the <hi>Author of Sinne,</hi> of <hi>Evill,</hi> of <hi>Falſhood.</hi> For, if I durſt to encounter that difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which hath troubled able Divines; yet would it be too tedious to inſert here, eſpecially when I have allready tranſgreſt with over much prolixity. Only thus.</p>
               <p>All <hi>Relations,</hi> you know, have their Originall, not from any <hi>peculiar Act</hi> whereby they are produced, diſtinct from that Act by which is produced that in which they are grounded; But ariſe and flow from that Abſolute Being, upon which they depend, <hi>per nudam Reſulta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tiam,</hi> by a Reſultation from it, without a new intermediate Act. The Father
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:130470:52"/>
doth not by One act beget his <hi>Sonne,</hi> and by Another act (He, or his Sonne) produce <hi>Filiation:</hi> But the <hi>terminirelationis</hi> being once produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, the <hi>Relation</hi> doth unavoidably follow: Two white things being produced, it is impoſſible <hi>(etiam per divinam potentiam)</hi> but that they muſt (in this) be Like.</p>
               <p>Now Falſhood and Truth, Good and Evill, being (as I have ſaid) Relations; and conſequently having no other Production, but their Reſultance from their Foundation; I leave it to others to judge, How farre God doth concurre with the operation of the Creature in produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing that <hi>Act,</hi> which is Good or Evill, True or Falſe; and How farre the Efficient of this Act may be affirmed the Cauſe of that <hi>Relation</hi> which doth reſult from it.</p>

               <p>We are ignorant, I grant, in the particular cauſes of divers things; and therefore when we have no other but thoſe two Generals, we muſt reſt there.

               <p>We ſay already, That the different <hi>Articulation of Sounds,</hi> ariſeth from the diverſe <hi>Figuration of the Organs.</hi> If his <hi>Numeri Platonici</hi> can give us a better account, I would be glad to heare it.</p>

               <p>NExt he ſhews us many doubts in <hi>Morall</hi> Philoſophy, as well as thoſe precedent in Naturall Philoſophy. But I doe not ſee that his Lordſhips Poſition will help to clear any one of them whatſoever.</p>
               <p>Whether the <hi>

               <p>How the Will may ſomtimes omit the proſecution of the Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings direction; I have already ſhewed, without <hi>making the Will an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstanding.</hi>

               <p>He glanceth at <hi>Aristotle's maintaining the Eternity of the World a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Hermes, Orpheus, Anaxagoras, &amp;c.</hi> For my own part, I would
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:130470:55"/>
be thankfull to him, that would ſolidly demonſtrate the <hi>Worlds Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> from principles in <hi>Nature,</hi> and make it appear from Naturall Light, that the World could not have been from Eternity. For though I deny not, but that there may be in <hi>Nature, Demonſtrative</hi> Arguments; yet I confeſſe, I have not as yet ſeen thoſe (and yet I have examined many) that have given me ſo full ſatisfaction as I deſire concernng an <hi>abſolute Impoſſibility;</hi> but that I have ſeen (at leaſt ſeemed to ſee) ſome juſt exception.</p>
               <p>But if his Lordſhips Opinion be True, I ſhall have more cauſe to doubt then I have formerly had. For <hi>if all things did exist in their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with God, ab omni aeterno;</hi> and their Temporall Exiſtence be onely Imaginary, <hi>to our apprehenſion:</hi> (as his Lordſhip affirms in his 11. Chapter, <hi>pag.</hi> 99.) I cannot imagine any hinderance at all, Why that which did <hi>really exiſt from all Eternity,</hi> might not be <hi>without a beginning;</hi> Why that which Was <hi>ab aeterno,</hi> might not (though it did not) <hi>ab aeterno</hi> Appear to be, and be Apprehended. I will not therefore blame <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi> for maintaining the Worlds Eternity as a diſputable Probleme, till I ſee ſome Light which might have convinced him, whilſt he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed not the benefit of Revealed Light; at leaſt, till this opinion of his Lordſhip be rejected.</p>
               <p>In the next place, I grant to his Lordſhip that there are doubts alſo in <hi>Metaphyſicks,</hi> in <hi>Logick,</hi> in <hi>Mathematicks.</hi> But I perceive not how this opinion diſſolves them.</p>
               <p>There be doubts alſo in <hi>Divinity,</hi> (though I do not ſee how this doth clear them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) <hi>Whether Faith, or Repentance be precedent: Whether Faith be a particular application of Chriſt to my ſelfe: or only a bare ſpirituall beliefe, that Christ is the Sonne of God.</hi>

But I chooſe rather to place it in an act of the <hi>Will,</hi> rather then in either of theſe fore-named acts of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstanding.</hi> It is an <hi>Accepting of Chriſt offered,</hi> rather then an <hi>Aſſenting to a Propoſition affirmed. To as many as [Received] him, &amp;c. that is, to them that Beleeve in his name, Joh.</hi> 1. God makes an offer of Chriſt to all, (elſe ſhould not Reprobates be condemned for not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:130470:55"/>
of him; as neither the Devils are, becauſe he was not offered to them) <hi>Whoſoever Will, let him come, and Take of the water of Life freely Rev.</hi> 22. 17. Whereupon the Beleeving Soule replies, I <hi>will,</hi> and ſo <hi>Takes</hi> him. When a Guift is Offered to mee; That which makes it to be <hi>Mine,</hi> is my <hi>Acceptation,</hi> my Taking it; Not the Knowing that it is <hi>Offered;</hi> nor the Knowing that it is <hi>Mine;</hi> For the one of theſe precedeth, the other followeth, the appropriating it to my ſelfe.</p>
               <p>If you call this <hi>Taking</hi> of Chriſt, (or conſenting that Chriſt ſhall be my Saviour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a <hi>Depending,</hi> a <hi>Reſting,</hi> or <hi>Relying</hi> upon Chriſt for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; (if you ſpeak of an Act of the Will:) It is all One. For, Taking of Chriſt to be my Saviour, and Committing my ſelfe to Chriſt to be Saved, is the ſame: Both of them being but a <hi>Conſenting</hi> to this Covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>I will be your God, and you ſhall be my people;</hi> I will be thy Father, and Thou ſhalt be my Sonne.</p>
               <p>And if you make this the <hi>Saving act</hi> of Faith; then will <hi>Repentance</hi> (ſo farre as it is diſtinct from Faith) be a Conſequent of it. <hi>Confidence</hi> alſo or <hi>Aſſurance</hi> that Chriſt is mine ariſeth from it: For Chriſt muſt firſt be Ours, before we can Know him ſo to be.</p>
               <p>Then alſo that, <hi>Whether Faith be a beleeving that I am Saved;</hi> (he meanes, <hi>in ſtatu ſalutis.) or a depending upon God for Salvation,</hi> (to be put into ſuch a Condition of Salvation,) will be eaſily reſolved, and <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmins Dilemma</hi> ſoon anſwered. <hi>viz. If Beliefe be to Beleeve that I am ſaved,</hi> (that Chriſt is mine,) <hi>then was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſaved without Faith: If it be, to beleeve that God will give me Grace to be ſaved, then do I beleeve before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have Grace, before I have Faith.</hi> I ſay, It is eaſily anſwered, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the <hi>Saving act</hi> of Faith, an <hi>Acceptance</hi> or <hi>Taking</hi> of Chriſt: For although the Guift be mine, before I <hi>Know;</hi> or am <hi>Aſſured,</hi> that it is mine; Yet is not the Guift mine, before my <hi>Accepting</hi> of it, but by my <hi>Acceptance</hi> it becomes <hi>Mine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If (with Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi>) we ſhould make <hi>Faith to ſave us,</hi> only <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rativè</hi> (which wee muſt by no means admit;) Then, Why is it ſaid, that we are ſaved by <hi>Faith,</hi> and not by <hi>Works?</hi> Why do we allow, that <hi>Faith</hi> doth <hi>concurrere effica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>That <hi>we are ſaved not only in the eternall Decree without faith, but even in the Execution,</hi> is ſtrange Divinity. For if without <hi>Faith,</hi> then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Christ;</hi> for Chriſt is no further <hi>Ours,</hi> then apprehended by Faith. As for the <hi>Eternall Decree</hi> (of Election, he meanes,) it is true, we are not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> through Faith, Elected to Salvation; but we are Elected, to Salvation
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:130470:56"/>
through Faith. Faith is not the Cauſe of the Decree, but Faith is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to be the Cauſe of Salvation.</p>
               <p>To that Queſtion, <hi>whether there be a preſcript Form of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> I ſhall ſay nothing; For it being a Queſtion maintained both wayes, I will not oppoſe either of them, unleſſe I had leiſure, to confirm what I ſay, to proſecute what I affirm. Only to his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I may lay an exception. <hi>Church-government,</hi> (which he preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be enjoined in the ſecond Commandement,) is not of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Morall Precepts,</hi> becauſe not of Perpetuall Continuance: (For ſuch <hi>a preſcript Form,</hi> as by which the Church ſince Chriſt ſhould be governed, had not its beginning till ſince Chriſt: And therfore not commanded in the ſecond Commandement any otherwiſe then by Conſequence; (as particular temporary duties are.) However, it is like, <hi>Church Government</hi> is not more expreſly commanded in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Commandement, then <hi>Civill Government</hi> in the fift; and yet none ever inferred from thence, a <hi>preſcript Form</hi> of <hi>Civill Government.</hi> If he ask therfore, <hi>Doe they leave us any latitude in any other Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</hi> I ſay, Yes: and I inſtance in That. He muſt ſearch for a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription,</hi> in the Evangeliſts, and Apoſtles writings, if he would find it, not in the ſecond Commandement.</p>
               <p>(Only, by the way, I wiſh his Lordſhip would do us the favour, from his doctrine of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> (which he makes the Salve to cure all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies,) to demonſtrate to us, Whether there be a <hi>Preſcript Form,</hi> and What it is. And I ſhould then judge his Opinion well worth imbracing, though for nothing elſe. Wherein yet I ſhall wiſh him to beware, that he ſay not of this as of the diviſion of Quantity, <hi>pag.</hi> 42. that <hi>all muſt at laſt be reduced to an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity;</hi> Nor, as <hi>pag.</hi> 98. that it is <hi>diviſibilis in infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitum.</hi> Leſt we eſtabliſh <hi>Epiſcopacy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>The diſtinction between <hi>Scientia ſimplicis Intelligentiae,</hi> and <hi>Scientia Viſionis,</hi> if it be taken only for <hi>diſtinctio rationis</hi> (and I ſuppoſe none ever tooke it otherwiſe) may well enough be admitted.

               <p>I grant, that God cannot doe, what he hath not decreed; for then were his Decree either Void, or Imperfect: And, ſuppoſing ſuch a Decree, the Power of God is limited by his Will.

               <p>And if <hi>Media Scientia,</hi> (wherby God is ſuppoſed to know an <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheticall</hi> Propoſition; as That the men of <hi>Keilah</hi> would deliver up <hi>David,</hi> if he ſtayed there) had no other hinderance but this; It might well enough be admitted.</p>

               <p>ANd now he returns again to his former complaint, of too much curioſity in the ſearch of <hi>Cauſes. There is</hi> (he grants) <hi>a ſecondary intermediate Being, which we may call a Cauſe; Which doth precede and produce another: The Obſervation of which,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The reſt of the Chapter is but a Recapitulation of his Poſition, and its Conſequents; which needs no further conſideration, beſides what I have already given you in the Examination of thoſe ſeverall Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars. I need not make anſwer to the Concluſion, having already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered my judgement concerning the Premiſes. But leave it to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to paſſe Cenſure.</p>
               <p>And thus, (Sir) I have finiſhed that Task, which at your requeſt I have undertaken: Which, beyond my expectation, is grown into a farre larger body then I intended. You expect not Accurateneſſe, in that which is drawn up in ſo ſhort a time: Nor the Judgement of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors in theſe Points; for that was not the task impoſed, to give you account of Others opinions, but of mine own. I have therefore ſpared the labour of turning over any other books, ſave his Lordſhips own; nor have made any farther uſe of any, then as my preſent memory did ſupply<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I may ſeem too prolix perhaps in ſome Digreſſions, proſecuting ſomewhat largely occaſionall queſtions, lighted on by the way: But if I have diſcovered any Truth, though with ſome breach of Method; If (with <hi>Samſon</hi>) I can impart to my friends ſome Honey, though I ſtep a little out of the way to fetch it; If, (as he found that Honey in the conquered Lion, which yet was not of it, but only accidentally there, ſo) I in the examining the main queſtion, have withall cleared

                  <p>Which Truth or Light (of Reaſon) he contends to be the ſame with the Underſtanding, Becauſe the Underſtanding in Man is that Ray of the Divine Nature, enlivening the Creature, or making it Rationall, whereby it is conformed to the Creator, who is the Primitive Light, or Fountain of Knowledge. Now that which doth thus enform <hi>Animal Rationale,</hi> enlivening it, or making it Rationall, is <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;</hi> And therefore Reaſon (which he calls <hi>Truth</hi>) is the ſame with the Underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>But this (if I miſtake not) none will deny; for Reaſon and the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding-faculty are all one, <hi>Ratio</hi> and <hi>facuitas Ratiocinandi</hi> is the ſame. 'Tis true, they ſay ſometimes, that Reaſon is <hi>in</hi> the Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or that the Underſtanding is indued with Reaſon: But then by <hi>

                  <p>His ſecond Argument to prove it is drawn from hence, That there is required to the conſtitution of every Being, an Eſſence received<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain imparting, and a Channel receiving. The which Channel or Recipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent muſt be the ſame with the Eſſence received; becauſe every thing is the Recipient of its own Eſſence; nothing can receive the Eſſence of a Stone, but by being a Stone, for to be Stone, and to have the Eſſence of a Stone, is all one. Therefore the Underſtanding being the Recipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of Truth, muſt needs be Truth, that is, Reaſon.</p>

                  <p>But I hope his Lordſhip will not deny, but that there is another kind of <hi>Receiving<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                        </gap>cto modi habendi;</hi> and there are as many manners of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, as there are of Having.) To receive the Eſſence of a Man, and to be a Man, is all one; To have the Eſſence of Money, and to be Money, is all one; But yet, I hope, a Man may receive Money, without being coined, and made Money. To receive the Eſſence of Water, and to be made Water; to receive the Eſſence of a Veſſell, and to be a Veſſell, is all one; yet a Veſſell may contein Water, without being made Water. Thus a Subſtance may receive an Accident, a Subject may receive a Form, without being made that Accident, that Form. Thus <hi>datur Animae eſſe Animam datur Rationi eſſe Rationem,</hi> (each being its own Recipient:) But withall <hi>datur Animae Habere Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem,</hi> though the Soule be not Reaſon, nor Reaſon (in this ſenſe) its own Recipient.</p>
                  <p>If there be any ſtrength in this Argument, it lies in this, That if Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (or Truth) be only in the Soule as an Accident, and not the Soules Eſſence, then it cannot make an Eſſentiall Difference between the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall and Irrationall Soule.</p>

                     <hi>Corollarium.</hi> 1. Chap. 6.</head>
                  <p>From hence he proceeds to a further Corollary, That not only the Soule, but All things elſe, are alſo the ſame with Truth. But why ſo? Becauſe every thing is its own Recipient? If it be; it doth not follow that every thing is the Recipient of Truth. If every thing be the Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pient of its own Eſſence, muſt therfore this Eſſence needs be Truth? If his Lordſhip had well conſidered, that Truth, as he hath formerly ſpoken of it, is but the ſame with that which others call Reaſon; he would ſcarce have made this Conſequence, unleſſe he could think to perſwade us, that all things whatſoever are Reaſonable Creatures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There is therefore too great an <hi>hiatus,</hi> to make this propoſition, a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollary of the former.</p>
                  <p>But indeed his Lordſhip is by this time fallen off from his former acceptation of Truth. For having (as he ſuppoſeth) proved Reaſon to be the Soules Eſſence, the Soules Entity; he begins to take that word (which formerly ſignified <hi>Reaſon,</hi>) to ſignify <hi>Entity,</hi> or Being: So that <hi>Truth</hi> now, muſt be the ſame with <hi>Entitas.</hi> And the Emphaſis of this laſt aſſertion lies in this, not that the Eſſence of all things is Truth, or Entity, (for that were no great news,) but that the Eſſence of all things is this <hi>One</hi> Truth: meaning, that all Entity is Homogeneall and of the ſame nature.</p>
                  <p>He was proving before, that Truth or Reaſon was the <hi>ſame thing</hi> with the Soule: He hence infers, not that all things are the <hi>ſame thing;</hi> (for I cannot underſtand him to ſpeak ſo harſhly, as that one drop of water were the ſame drop with another drop of water, though Homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneall; that the Soule of <hi>Peter</hi> is the Soule of <hi>Judas,</hi> though of the ſame <hi>Species;</hi>) but that they are <hi>alike things,</hi> or things of the <hi>ſame nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Conſequence, (that all things muſt be of the ſame <hi>Species,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Soule and its Faculties are the ſame Thing) will not hold.
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:130470:59"/>
The thing it ſelfe, hath only this ground (ſo farre as I can diſcover,) Becauſe all Being proceeding from God, who is in his actions Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, muſt therfore be Alike: For the ſame Agent, acting in the ſame Manner, cannot but produce like Effects. But this Uniformity in God' is Equivalent to an infinite Variety; and God can by one act in it ſelfe ſimple, produce effects variouſly diſtinct<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And if his Lordſhip grant, that this Uniformity hinders not but that God may produce various Shapes, I ſee not why he may not produce various <hi>Species.</hi>

And therefore tells us, that actions per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in diſtinct Times and Places are not therefore diſtinct actions, becauſe Time and Place are Nothing, but meerly imaginary.</p>

                  <p>To the firſt he applyes his former remedy; Any one act is able to give the Soule a Being at all times; for ſucceſſion of moments being onely imaginary, that which at all is, muſt be alwayes, and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hath at all a Being, is indeed coexiſtent to all Eternity; ſucceſſion, beginning, and ending being onely imaginary: (So that a Childe that is new born, had lived as long as the moſt aged, if he could but think ſo.</p>

                  <p>Which he affirms likewiſe of Evill, and of Pain; And tells us, with Dr. <hi>Twiſſe,</hi> that it is better to be Miſerable, then not to be: Which is grounded upon this, that Evill is only a privation of Good, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to have the goodneſſe Being without the goodneſſe of Happineſſe, is better then to want both the one and the other.</p>
                  <p>But withall I wiſh them to conſider, whether the ſame Argument do not prove, that it was better for <hi>David</hi> to commit adultery, then not to commit it; For the ſubſtance of the act, in its Phyſicall Eſſence, was poſitive, and therefore Good; the fault was only the want of a further good, to wit, the goodneſſe of conformity to Gods will; now to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce

the goodneſſe of an Act, without the goodneſſe of Conformity, is better then to produce neither the one nor the other.</p>

                  <p>This is his Lordſhips Opinion. Which he commends to us as uſefull to make our Chriſtian life more cheerefull both in the Theoreticall and Practick part. For if we knew, that All things are one, what need we feare either difficulty or danger? knowing, That Miſery is nothing and cannot hurt us, and hath no Being but only in the the Brain; That whatſoever is, is Good, and good to Me, Becauſe both I and It are Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and ſo Good; And theſe two Goods falling under no other dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference but of degrees, Good and Good muſt needs agree, that which is Good is Good to Me. Yea, how void of Envy at anothers good, and thoughts of Revenging injuries? ſince that I have a Propriety, a Poſſeſſion, in that which is anothers, hee and I being One: Injuries are nothing and cannot hurt; Good things, though anothers, doe ſerve me.</p>
                  <p>But to this Good Conſequent of his Lordſhips Tenet, I can op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe another every way as Bad: For as it would make us not afraid of Miſery, ſo withall, not afraid to Sinne. It propoſeth ſuch an Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to Sinning, as that it makes the Devils as happy as the bleſſed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. For thus we might argue; The Devils are Beings, and therefore Good, becauſe <hi>Ens &amp; Bonum convertuntur:</hi> Every thing that is, is Good, and Good to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hem; for both They and It being good, and Good admitting of no other difference but of degrees, Good and Good muſt needs agree, and ſo be good to them: The happineſſe of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels doth ſerve Them, ſince (as his Lordſhip ſpeaks) it is not onely <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, They have a propriety in it; all things being One. Their own Miſery and Torment is nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and cannot hurt: And (which is the only difference can be imagined) if they Think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, (I uſe ſtill his Lordſhips expreſſion) this muſt be a Lye, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hurt. And if this be Hell, who will be afraid to Sinne?</p>
                  <p>My judgement cannot aſſent, to make the Torments of the damned only Imaginary, to make Hell a Fancy; yea, to affirm, that it is good to Sinne, becauſe the act of ſinne is really Good, and the Evill of it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Imaginary, a Vanity, a Nothing, and cannot hurt.</p>
                  <p>As for the Theoreticall part; it is confeſſed, that there be many doubts in Naturall Philoſophy, concerning the Being, the Nature, the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:130470:62"/>
Cauſes of things; There be doubts alſo in Morall Philoſophy, in Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſicks, in Mathematicks, in Divinity: But in telling us this, his Lordſhip advanceth nothing for the commendation of his new inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; except he could ſhew us how this Tenet will reſolve them.</p>

Reſpondeo, unio qua uniuntur materia &amp; forma non ſimplex eſt, ſed duplex, una in materiâ per quam ipſa unitur formae, alia in formâ per quam ipſa unitur materiae. Sicut in relationibus, v. g. Socrates &amp; Plato ſunt ſimiles (puta in albedine) non tamen per eandem ſimilitudinem ſed per diverſam, relatum enim &amp; correlatum referuntur ad invicem per relationes diverſas; nec enim relatio patris ad filium eadem eſt cum relatione filii ad patrem; &amp; licèt in relationibus ejuſdem nominis res non ſit adeò perſpicua, ratio tamen eadem eſt, habent enim diſtincta fundamenta; ſic ſimilitudo Socratis ad Platonem fundatur in albedine Socratis, ſimilitudo Platonis ad Socratem in albedine Platonis, quae fundamenta cùm ſint realiter diſtincta, ita &amp; relationes quae cum fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentis identificantur: ut autem Socrates &amp; Plato ſunt ſimiles per duas realiter diſtinctas ſimilitudines, ita materia &amp; forma uniuntur per duas realiter diſtinctas uniones (ſi ſaltem ipſae materia &amp; forma realiter diſtinguantur.)</p>
