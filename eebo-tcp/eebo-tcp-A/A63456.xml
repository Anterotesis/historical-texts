         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>UPON the receipt of the following <hi>Letter</hi> concerning
the nature of <hi>Taxes,</hi> and levying of Mony upon
the Subject, I immediately resolv'd to commit it
to the <hi>Press;</hi> as conceiving that it might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental
towards the removal of that <hi>popular Argument,</hi>
which the <hi>Mal-contents</hi> of the Age are so industrious to instil
into the Minds of the common sort<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> That frequent
<hi>Taxes</hi> are an ins<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>pportable grievance and oppression to the
Nation; and this by so much they the more successfully
propagate, by how much 'tis a received Opinion among the
<hi>Populace,</hi> and such as either for want of parts, or not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>om'd
to serious reflections, have not throughly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
this Affair; whence 'tis come to pass, that this vulgar
Error has obtained so general a consent and approbation,
that it needs not to be much inculcated. This the disaffected
Party to the present Government are sufficiently sensible of,
and therefore are not unactive in the establishment of an
untruth, which has the advantage of making a deep im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
upon such, whose byass'd and prejudicate senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
render them fit Objects of their design: <hi>Sed dato, &amp;
non concesso,</hi> allowing, but not granting, that <hi>Taxes</hi> were
really a <hi>burthen</hi> to the Nation; yet if it be true that <hi>è malis
<pb facs="tcp:55344:3"/>
minimum,</hi> of two <hi>evils,</hi> the least is to be chosen. It will
thence follow, that 'tis better for the Kingdom to have
purchas'd its redemption from <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Power,</hi>
though at the price of some <hi>part</hi> of the Estates and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
of the Subject; rather than to have lost all at one
<hi>throw,</hi> by a Tyrannical Invasion upon their <hi>Religion, Laws,</hi>
and <hi>Liberties.</hi> I presume that even some of those busie
<hi>Agents</hi> who <hi>sow</hi> these <hi>seeds</hi> of Discord and Division among
us, would have been content to have bought their safety
almost at any rate, whilest the <hi>Storm</hi> was imminent; and
now that 'tis happily blown over, and nothing appears at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
but a <hi>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rene Skie,</hi> and <hi>fair Weather:</hi> Why should they either
endeavour a reduction both of themselves and others to
their former <hi>danger,</hi> to which their turbulent devices do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
tend; or strive to create unreasonable dissatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions
against so just an expedient, as each ones discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a <hi>few pence</hi> for an ensurance of the publick <hi>Peace,</hi> and
quiet settlement of the Nation?</p>
            <p>'Tis surely very unaccountable, that those Men, who
discovered so great an alacrity and forwardness in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
of <hi>Popish Tyranny</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Power,</hi> should now
endeavour to enslave us under the same uneasie <hi>Yoke;</hi> but
with this additional aggravation to our former servitude,
that whereas we were then allowed <hi>some,</hi> we must now
<hi>make Brick without Straw.</hi> This seems so wild a notion of
Obedience (the result of the <hi>Passive Doctrine)</hi> and that the

interest of humane Society. But these murmuring, sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
<hi>Spirits,</hi> after shamefully retracting from their early
officiousness, in their encouragement of the late Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the then <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange,</hi> are not content with
a compleat enjoyment of their <hi>Properties,</hi> under the even
steerage of this great and skilful <hi>Pilot,</hi> who so justly
manages the <hi>Helm</hi> of the present Government, as not to invade
the Rights of any Man; nor yet to retain their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
sentiments within their own breasts, but they must
needs vent and divulge them to others, by which t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the publick <hi>Incendiaries</hi> of the Nation. But as I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
enough admire both the folly and ingratitude of these
Men, who strive to disseminate so poysonous a Contagion;
so have I not room left for wonder and surprize, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
divers innocent well-meaning Persons so unwarily
catch'd and infected by it, when not many <hi>Months ago,</hi> their
<hi>Lives, Religion, Liberties,</hi> all that was dear or acceptable unto
them, lay apparently at stake. For which, I pray, do they
account the more advantagious, whether their <hi>

be infring'd, their <hi>Religion</hi> violated, their <hi>Laws</hi> subverted,
their <hi>Estates</hi> confiscated, and they, with their Wives, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and Relations, to be expos'd to the <hi>Fiery Tryal,</hi> or to
be seasonably freed from these amazing terrours, ready to
overwhelm them in a full carrere, when they received a sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and miraculous, as well as a gracious deliverance, and
that as much above their hopes, as it has since appeared to be
beyond their <hi>desert?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What would not every <hi>honest Man,</hi> or <hi>good Christian,</hi> have
given at that time to have had that security under his own
<hi>Vine,</hi> and under his own <hi>Fig tree,</hi> the liberty of his <hi>Religion,</hi>
the full enjoyment of his <hi>Property,</hi> and an equal and just ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of the <hi>Laws,</hi> which he now enjoys under the
benign influence and protection of the present Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
And then with what <hi>face</hi> can he deny to contribute his
respective <hi>share,</hi> and proportion, not only to the assuring of
his own particular right, but also that of the general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
together with what is infinitely preserable to either,
the Protestant Religion in the three Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>All this, and much more, which might be offered, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
upon (were not prolixity improper in a Preface, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ially
to so small a Discourse, as is that of the following Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
seems exceeding reasonable upon the former <hi>Hypothesis,</hi>
if <hi>Taxes</hi> were really a burthen and oppression to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which the following Sheets do abundantly evince that
they are not, by shewing that they are so far from being a
diminution of, that they really add to the <hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Riches</hi> of
a State.</p>

of those Countries where <hi>Taxes</hi> are most numerous, and

to demonstrate the <hi>practicableness,</hi> as well as equal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the same to these Kingdoms. This I thought to
be of such seasonable and publick importance, in reference
to the present state of affairs, as well in order to the recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
the afore mention'd general prejudice and mistake, as
to silencing of all intemperate and unreasonable mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murers
against the proceedings of the <hi>Grand Council</hi> of the
Nation, in the methods taken for a supply of the Naval and
Land-forces, that I thought fit to usher it into publick view,
as considering that if these Men who most inveigh against
<hi>Taxes,</hi> could be brought to believe, that they naturally
tend to the advantage and interest of the State, and do
really conduce to the enriching and improvement of it;
they must needs cease from their Seditious clamours against,
and Satyrical reflections upon the Government in this respect;
and that this would not be the sole advantage which would
accrew from the clearing up of this mistake, but that all <hi>honest</hi>
and <hi>good Men</hi> will joyn more cordially than ever in their una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous
and chearful contributions to its support, when they
are made sensible, that not only the common <hi>duty</hi> of Subjects,

                  <p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:55344:9"/>And first, let us consider who it is that lay Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
upon us; 'Tis Men chose by our selves.</p>
                  <p>The difference indeed is great in the <hi>modus</hi> of our
<hi>Taxes,</hi> from other Kingdoms, and also in the use of
them. For the <hi>Modus</hi> in other Kingdoms, they generally
consider only the Nobility and Gentry, that Impositions
may not touch or affect them, and care not how insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable
or grievous they are to the Commonalty: But
with us the <hi>Taxes</hi> reach every man in proportion to his
Quality and Expence.</p>
                  <p>In other Kingdoms they place Taxes only to raise Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and have no regard to the Trade of their Kingdom,
that so their Taxes may not prejudice their Commerce.
But in <hi>England</hi> care is alwaies had, that Impositions may
not impede our Trade and Manufactories.</p>
                  <p>Now, as to the Use and Employment of Taxes in other
Kingdoms, they also differ much from ours.</p>
                  <p>In some Kingdoms <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> are imposed to enslave the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and keep them poor, as in <hi>Muscovy;</hi> in other parts
Taxes are laid to enrich the Nobility, as in <hi>Poland;</hi> in
others, to fill the Coffers of the Prince, as in <hi>Florence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereas none of these Uses take up our Taxes; they
are with great Care and Caution lain out, and by the same
Law that raises them, appropriated for a particular ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and last no longer upon the People, than the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of the Nation requires; for that we never have
Money raised, but for the defence of the Kingdom; tho'
as I shall shew in the close of this Discourse, 'twould re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
dound to the advantage of the Kingdom, if there were
more Taxes raised, and these assigned to publick Uses in
Peace as well as War.</p>
                  <p>I shall now come to the chief design of this Discourse,
which is, to demonstrate, That <hi>Taxes are no Charge</hi> either
to the Kingdom in general, or to particular Persons; but
on the contrary a Gain to all.</p>
                  <p>But to render this matter the more plain and intelligible,
I shall proceed after the following method.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>I. Shew who in the Kingdom pay the greatest part of
the Taxes.</item>
                     <item>
                        <pb n="10" facs="tcp:55344:10"/>II. What Use is made of these Taxes; and how they
circulate in the Kingdom.</item>
                     <item>III. How Trade is improved by Taxes.</item>
                     <item>IV. That the Poor are imployed by them.</item>
                     <item>V. That a Sett of Men of no use in the Kingdom, are
by Taxes made profitable in the <hi>Common-wealth.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>VI. That Taxes, especially when Trade is stopped by
War, is the only Remedy to keep the <hi>Trading</hi> and
<hi>Mechanick hands</hi> of the Kingdom employed.</item>
                     <item>VII. That Taxes will enrich the Nation, and disperse
in it as much Treasure, when there is no <hi>Foreign
Trade,</hi> as when 'tis open.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>To begin then with the <hi>First Head, Who it is that pay
most of the Taxes:</hi> They are the worst Members in the
<hi>Common-wealth (viz.)</hi> The Extravagant and Debauch'd.
The greatest Duties are, or should be laid upon Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
for Pleasure and Sumptuousness, as <hi>Silks, Gold</hi>
and <hi>Silver Lace, &amp;c.</hi> Now these are wore in the greatest
Excess, by the Extravagant of the Kingdom, both Men
and Women. A <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>shee</hi> shall spend more out of an Estate
of a <hi>Thousand pounds a year,</hi> than a regular man will from
the annual Income of five times that proportion; and a
Miss lay out more on Clothes than a Countess: So in the
Excess to indulge the Belly, as well as providing for the
Back. The vast consumption of Wines and strong Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors,
is by this sort of Men; nay, the poorest <hi>Debauch,</hi>
that can rise no higher than to <hi>Beer</hi> and <hi>Tabaco,</hi> pays
ten times as much in the year, in proportion to his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
as the greatest Peer. 'Twill hardly gain belief, that
there is many of the meaner People, <hi>Labourers</hi> and <hi>Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks,</hi>
that by their Expence, when they are (as too many
be) extravagant, pay to the publick <hi>Taxes</hi> above one tenth
of their daily profit: As, supposing that a labouring man
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55344:10"/>
may earn <hi>Sixte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n pounds a year,</hi> he will expend, though
not very extraordinarily profuse, one half of it in <hi>Drink</hi>
and <hi>Tabaco,</hi> upon which, the Duty of Customs and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
is, at least, two pounds of the eight, which he lays
out in idle Expences. Now, it would be vehemently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cried
and exclaimed against, as the greatest Oppression upon
the Poor imaginable, if by a <hi>Poll</hi> or <hi>Land-Tax,</hi> this man,
that vertually pays <hi>Forty Shillings,</hi> should actually, and
above-board, pay so many pence by the year.</p>
                  <p>Thus we see<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that most of the Duties and Impositions
on the Kingdom light upon such as do least good with
their Substance; and since they imprudently fling it away
upon their Extravagancies: 'tis certainly a Benefit to the
Kingdom, that there are Taxes, to catch something out
of it, for the improvement of better disposed men; as we
shall see in the next Paragraph.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Particular is, What use is made of these
Taxes; and how they circulate in the Kingdom: In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to which, there are but two waies, in which they are
employed; one is for the <hi>King's Court,</hi> the other for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
of <hi>War,</hi> in the maintenance of <hi>Naval</hi> and <hi>Land
Forces.</hi> Now, both these are as well the Employment of
<hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Artizans,</hi> as they resolve into the Security of
the Kingdom, and the preservation of the Publick Peace.
There is no Money which circulates so fast, as that which
comes into the hands of <hi>Seamen</hi> and <hi>Souldiers.</hi> Other men,
that get Money, frequently lay it up, and so it becomes of
no use or benefit in the Kingdom; But, Men that live by
their Pay, generally spend it faster than it comes in, by
which means the Money of the Kingdom, like the Blood
in the Veins, has its regular, circular motion, and every
Member in the <hi>Body</hi> is warm'd and refreshed by it, which
gives Life and Motion in the whole. And thus I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume,
this Second Instance of the Use of Taxes proves,
That they are of Advantage and Profit to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> How <hi>Trade</hi> is improved by <hi>Taxes.</hi> Upon this
Head there is much to be said; and first, It will be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55344:11"/>
to say something of the nature of <hi>Trade,</hi> how it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
the Kingdom; for that <hi>Trade</hi> may in some Cases
prejudice a Nation, and make it poor; as the Trade of
<hi>Spain</hi> does that Kingdom. <hi>Trade</hi> may also effeminate
and debauch a Country, as it does <hi>Italy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, 'tis certain, that we are not free from both
these publick Mischiefs and Inconveniencies in <hi>England;</hi>
though our Fortune is such, that being <hi>Islanders,</hi> and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of one <hi>Commodity,</hi> which no Kingdom has in that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
as our selves, which is Wool that hath put our
People upon <hi>Manufactories,</hi> which is the Treasure of this
<hi>Nation,</hi> and keeps our Exports to a ballance with our Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports;
otherwise this Kingdom would have been as <hi>Poor</hi>
as <hi>Spain,</hi> and as effeminate as <hi>Italy;</hi> but the Employment
of our milder sort in <hi>Manufactories</hi> at home, and the more
robust at Sea abroad, keeps us a People in action, and so
preserv'd from the Luxury and Effeminateness of <hi>Italy,</hi>
and the Poverty of <hi>Spain.</hi> I need not spend time to
prove how far we are tainted with the Mischiefs before
mentioned. Our Trade with <hi>France,</hi> in all Ages past, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
proves, That a Kingdom may be made poor by
Trade; as we should have been by the vast treasure their
<hi>Linnens, Wine, Silks, Toys,</hi> and <hi>Salt,</hi> drew from this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
if our other Commerce in the World, had not bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced
our loss there.</p>
                  <p>Nor are we free from the Effeminateness of <hi>Italy,</hi>
which I take to be the Returns of our Gentry's travels, a
mischief to be lamented, rather than expected a <hi>Reformation</hi>
of, since we are arriv'd to that height of Vanity, as to think
that man not accomplished who is not become <hi>Master</hi> of
the Delicacies of <hi>Italy,</hi> and extravagant Modes of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to return to my Province, How Trade is improved
by Taxes, for the Proof of which Assertion it seems plain,
That some Trade may impair a Kingdom, and such Taxes
and Impositions may abate by imposing such <hi>Duties</hi> as they
cannot bear. So far then it will be allowed, that they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
Trade, as we commonly say, <hi>Saving is Gain;</hi> so, if
we keep out a destructive Trade by Duties, we may
allow that an Improvement of our own.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:55344:11"/>But to come nearer to the matter; <hi>Taxes</hi> improve <hi>Trade</hi>
by employing <hi>numbers</hi> of <hi>idle Men</hi> in <hi>Naval,</hi> and <hi>Land-ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi>
that would otherwise be of no use; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
a Pest, and Charge to the <hi>Commonwealth.</hi> We sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
see any inlisted into the <hi>Army,</hi> that are Men of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry,
or Labour; such persons are the Wens and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crescencies
of the <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> that de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>orm, but not
strengthen the Body; and these being paid by the <hi>Taxes</hi> of
another sort of <hi>Creatures</hi> as (before I mention'd) are of
no use in the <hi>State;</hi> but to throw abroad the <hi>Treasure</hi> left
them by their <hi>Fathers,</hi> is virtually an improvement of
<hi>Trade:</hi> for that all like the <hi>Rivers</hi> in the <hi>Sea,</hi> terminate
in the hands of <hi>Industry</hi> and <hi>Trade;</hi> and perhaps, if duly
con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>idered, more Men, and with more certain profit make
Voyages within this <hi>Island</hi> upon this <hi>Fund,</hi> than there
do to most of our <hi>Foreign Trades.</hi> And in this place
I must touch again upon the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>Trade,</hi> to shew that
private hands may raise their Fortunes by a <hi>Trade,</hi> that
may yet be a loss to a Kingdom, as in that of <hi>France,</hi>
already insisted upon, many, I was like to say, too many
have acquired great Estates by. Now all the hands em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y'd
in that <hi>Trade</hi> were no better than <hi>Robbers</hi> of the
Kingdom, in carrying away our <hi>Treasure,</hi> as we use the <hi>Moors,</hi>
giving us <hi>Gold</hi> for <hi>Glass-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eads.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is another sort of <hi>Trade,</hi> that though it may not
immediately carry away any of the Stock of the Kingdom,
yet it does hurt in taking off Hands, that might be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
to the advantage of the Kingdom. Now in both
these the <hi>Trade</hi> of <hi>Taxes,</hi> for so I will call it for the <hi>future,</hi>
has the advantage, for that it carries nothing out of the
Kingdom, nor yet takes off <hi>hands</hi> that would be better
employ'd, but on the contrary takes away the disease of
the Country, <hi>idlers,</hi> and makes 'em at least so profitable,
as to spend Mony, which they would not be able to do,
if the <hi>Publick Revenue</hi> were not their <hi>Stock.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>poor</hi> are employed by <hi>Taxes,</hi> and are
by that means taken off from being a <hi>Charge</hi> to the
Kingdom; many Men of broken Fortunes are brought
into the <hi>Hospital</hi> of the <hi>Revenue,</hi> which may be so accounted,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55344:12"/>
since 'tis generally fill'd with persons that are reduc'd to
such necessities, as qualifie them for <hi>Charity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is one way, that <hi>Taxes</hi> employ the <hi>Poor,</hi> but not
the main thing I mean; which is, That the Trade of <hi>Taxes</hi>
employs the <hi>poor Artizans,</hi> and <hi>Mechanicks,</hi> and that in
a greater <hi>measure,</hi> than our <hi>Virginia,</hi> and <hi>Plantation-trade,</hi> we
with so little reason so much boast of, in these King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</p>
                  <p>By the <hi>Observations</hi> I have always made in my Traversing
the <hi>World,</hi> I find, that those <hi>parts</hi> have been most opulent,
and the <hi>People</hi> safest; that filled their own <hi>Hives</hi> and
kept their <hi>Swarms</hi> at home. That little <hi>Commonwealth</hi> of
<hi>Luca</hi> to me seems a pattern for all the <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi>
and is as practicable in the greatest Dominions, as that
little <hi>Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t,</hi> whose <hi>Land</hi> and <hi>Cities</hi> (having <hi>Luna</hi> joyned to
it) are all circumscribed within the limits of <hi>Six</hi> or <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Miles</hi> square; yet in that compass they are able to raise
about <hi>Twenty thousand Horse</hi> and <hi>Foot:</hi> a thing almost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible,
but known by all that have travelled that way, and
were curious into such Enquiries.</p>
                  <p>These <hi>People</hi> are of wonderful Industry, and enrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by their <hi>Manufactories,</hi> which they go not abroad
to seek a Market for, but mind their Work at home, and so
become more considerable, than those that spend their time
in Travels, being by their settl'd living, able to afford their
Commodities they make, cheaper, than the <hi>Genoese</hi> and
<hi>Florentines,</hi> their <hi>Neighbours.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When I see in <hi>Foreign Parts,</hi> how rich and powerful a
little <hi>Siegniory, Commonwealth,</hi> or <hi>State</hi> is made by hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding
their <hi>People,</hi> I often lament the misfortunes of my
<hi>Native Country,</hi> that might certainly abound with the
greatest, and most formidable People in <hi>Europe,</hi> if they
followed their Steps. I have taken up some of your time
in this <hi>Discourse</hi> of <hi>Trade;</hi> which may seem <hi>Foreign</hi> to my
Subject of <hi>Taxes,</hi> yet I must be obliged to do it in all
my <hi>future Arguments,</hi> because <hi>Taxes</hi> both arise out of
<hi>Trade,</hi> and maintain <hi>Trade.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:55344:12"/>To return then to where I left off, That the <hi>poor</hi> are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
by them in their several Occupations: how many

our Land and Sea-forces, which could have no vent
for their Commodities, if they were not taken off at

                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> There is a Set of Men, who like <hi>Rats</hi> in a

Gain, but will Buy for half Value any thing they
can meet with from a Person in Extremity: and next unto
these, are such as adore their Bags, and will upon no Terms
part with these Deities: their Bags are no Thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair,
only a way in, but none out. These Men are by
<hi>Taxes</hi> made against their wills small Benefactors to their
Country, and it were to be wished that our <hi>great</hi> and wise
<hi>Council</hi> of the Nation would yet pursue them farther, and
lay a double imposition upon <hi>Mony locked</hi> up in <hi>Chests,</hi>

                     <hi>Sixthly, Taxes,</hi> especially in time of War, are the only
preservation of all Men employ'd in <hi>Trades</hi> and <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factories;</hi>
and perhaps not much inferiour to Foreign
Trade, if in all respects considered: for as to what is spent

Kingdom is not the poorer for Mony so raised, and so spent;
and in times of War, and prohibition of Trade abroad,
if Money were not raised by <hi>Taxes,</hi> and that employed

to employ all our <hi>hands</hi> in time of <hi>War,</hi> as fully in
their <hi>Manufactories,</hi> as ever they were in a <hi>Free Trade,</hi>
though when they were made, they were <hi>burnt,</hi> it being

                  </p>
                  <p>Here I must touch again upon <hi>Trade,</hi> and enquire what
<hi>Trade</hi> brings us in <hi>Bullion, Gold,</hi> or <hi>Coin;</hi> for we have
some of all, though considering the Value of our <hi>Native
Commodities,</hi> 'tis wonderful that we should have so little; and
that of those numerous <hi>Trades,</hi> which our <hi>Navigation</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titles
us to, that we should by carrying in our Ships, our
own <hi>Manufactories,</hi> out of all those advantages add so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to the <hi>Treasure</hi> of the Kingdom, and bring home no
<hi>Bullion,</hi> but by our <hi>Trade</hi> to <hi>Spain,</hi> and some little from
the <hi>Levant,</hi> our <hi>Guinea Trade,</hi> and for some years past,
<hi>Buckaneers</hi> in the <hi>West-Indies.</hi> But that which is our best
Fund, is the Trade of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal;</hi> the former is
made considerable to us by our <hi>East-India Commodities,</hi> which
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55344:13"/>
fetch from <hi>Spain,</hi> more than we send out in <hi>Specie,</hi> though
some believe the <hi>East-India Company</hi> does us hurt, by carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out the <hi>Gold</hi> of the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Now then if the greatest part of our <hi>Trade</hi> consists in
bringing in <hi>Commodity</hi> for <hi>Commodity,</hi> then all the benefit o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that <hi>Trade</hi> is, That it gives employment to our common
People in their <hi>Mechanick</hi> Arts; and if we can do that by
our own expence at home, 'tis more the profit of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
than by sending them abroad; for that we avoid the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of the Sea, and other accidents abroad: it seems
then that <hi>Taxes</hi> do that, since they issue forth Mony for
payment of our <hi>Artizans,</hi> and <hi>Mechanicks,</hi> that are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in making Commodities for our own use, and at
the same time enough for that Foreign Trade, which fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes
us with <hi>Bullion:</hi> and by that it appears that we
are much greater gainers by the Trade of <hi>Taxes,</hi> than by
all our Foreign Trade, which brings in nothing but <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity</hi>
for our own expence. We see that the Care of our
<hi>Parliament</hi> is, to prevent the <hi>Importation</hi> of <hi>Foreign Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,</hi>

of Mony: the Merchants, and other Traders, find
it in their payments, and receipts; the <hi>Country Farmer</hi> in
the sale of his Corn and Cattle: for this is certain, that

to their <hi>Mony</hi> or <hi>Fortune,</hi> not <hi>Appetite</hi> or <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:</hi>
many Men content, or rather confine themselves to a
Threepenny Ordinary, that would spend Twelve Pence,
if they had it. So that after all the noise and clamour that
is made in the Kingdom, inveighing literally against the
heavy Taxes, which are on the Subject; this unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
declaiming is made for <hi>them</hi> that no Man loves,
the griping <hi>Misers,</hi> that hoord up Mony: for he indeed
seems only aggrieved, that pays out to support Trade, in
which he never had the Heart to do good; and even this
Man would be a gainer too by Taxes, if he were not
separate from humane Society, and trusted neither God,
nor Man; whatever he has to do in the World, is to see that
he runs no hazard in it, and whoever he deals with must be
<hi>sure</hi> to <hi>him,</hi> though he cannot be <hi>so</hi> to <hi>himself.</hi> And besides
this extream <hi>Earth-worm</hi> that hoords, there is another

that is such as have more <hi>Mony</hi> by them, than they can
employ, and perhaps would gladly put it out to <hi>Interest,</hi>
but cannot: These are less faulty than the former, yet
should be obliged to do some good with their Treasures,
and the best way seems to lay a round Tax upon that Mony.
'Tis with reason believed that there is now <hi>ten times</hi> the
proportion of <hi>Mony</hi> in the Kingdom, as was in the <hi>Reign</hi>
of <hi>King Iames</hi> the First; yet not more stirring in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
but what is brought out by <hi>Customes</hi> and <hi>Duties;</hi>
then would it not be as beneficial to Trade by Taxes upon
the Misers and Hoorders of Mony before-mentioned, to
fetch it out from them, as with <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and nothing but such impositions as may supply the want
of Trade, can keep our <hi>Artizans</hi> and <hi>Manufactories</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have huddl'd together a mixt <hi>Discourse,</hi> which

apprehension; but your greater judgment will unite its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruities:
I can only justifie the <hi>matter</hi> to be in the main
of it, Collections from the practice and usage of other
places; for what relates to this <hi>Nation,</hi> you are a better
<hi>Iudge</hi> than I am, who am guided by the <hi>practice</hi> of <hi>Trade,</hi>
and that is, I doubt, too often exploded by <hi>Ministers</hi> of
<hi>State.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I confess the <hi>Fatigues</hi> of <hi>Government,</hi> are above the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of a <hi>Mercantine head,</hi> and therefore I acquiesce without
much enquiry in to them, only sit often down with doubtful
conjectures of the issue of our present Affairs.</p>
                  <p>I mean not of the present distractions which an inconsiderable

than it does other <hi>Christians:</hi> these will cease with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
Interest,</hi> that masks it self under them; but that which
I fear, is, a distraction of the <hi>Trades, Manufactories,</hi> and

to take away that which should be <hi>bread</hi> for the <hi>decay'd</hi>

                  <p>And then, <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is mischievous to the <hi>Commonwealth</hi>
to have Men that can employ themselves in it, to be
taken off from promoting the publick in their proper
Station.</p>
                  <p>Having thus run through the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Vse</hi> of Taxes,
with the reasons that seem perswasive, as to the great
help they are to the support of this Kingdom; you may

perhaps expect I should say something of the way, how
Taxes may be most beneficially, and easily layn, but in

                  <p>I beg <hi>pardon</hi> for this Digression, which I make only to
shew the cause, why I am loth to <hi>crowd</hi> in among the
<hi>Politicks,</hi> as <hi>he</hi> that gives this <hi>advice</hi> to the <hi>Parliament</hi> often
mentions.</p>
                  <p>But though I dare not presume to direct the best and
most pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>itable way of <hi>Taxes;</hi> yet I will here name such
as I think are not the most desireable, and then mention
such as in other parts of the World are thought most
agreeable.</p>
                  <p>For, such as I take to be uneasie to the People, and
not most profitable to the State, are, <hi>First,</hi> Those that
are levied on the Subject by way of <hi>Fees</hi> in <hi>Offices.</hi>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:55344:15"/>
This, that in its original was either to be a profit to the
<hi>Crown,</hi> in bringing in Money to the <hi>King's Exchequer,</hi> or
an ease to the <hi>Crown,</hi> in saving the Charge of <hi>Salleries</hi> for
<hi>Officers</hi> about the Law, &amp;c. is now become neither. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
if an Estimate was made, there would be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ound
some <hi>Millions</hi> Sterling raised in this Kingdom on Offices,
of which there comes not the <hi>Thousandth part</hi> into the
<hi>King's Treasury;</hi> nor, that which is more strange, not a
Penny saved of the King's Charge in maintaining those
Officers. Some have <hi>thousands</hi> a year in Fees and Perqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites,
that yet have a large Sallary from the <hi>King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Others have Offices, whose Fees, when first establisht,
would but afford an honest Livelihood to the Officer
that o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ficiated; but in process of time 'tis advanced to
<hi>ten times</hi> that value, and now is managed by a Deputy,
perhaps for less than a <hi>twentieth part</hi> of the profit of the
Office. This seems a grievous <hi>Tax,</hi> and would be thought
so, if appropriated to any particular use of the <hi>Crown:</hi>
As for example; If the <hi>Parliament</hi> should give a certain
Tax to the King, for maintaining a War with <hi>France,</hi>
and this Tax, contrary to expectation, amounted to <hi>five
times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> the Charge of that War, would it be thought rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
for the King to demand a farther Supply from
the People? Or rather, Would it not be thought equal,
to ease the Subject of so much of that Tax, as is surplus
to the Charge.</p>
                  <p>The Case seems Parallel in Offices, and if enquired into,
there may be thought almost enough there to save the
Kingdom from other Taxes; but I would not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
to invade any Mans Property. The wisdom of the
Nation might find Expedients to do a general Good,
without a particular injury to any man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Poll Money seems an unequal and unprofitable
Tax; unequal, if it be by a general way, <hi>all Heads</hi> to
pay alike, the <hi>Cobler</hi> with the <hi>Lord;</hi> and unprofitable, if it
be by distinction of Qualities: for that it gives great
opportunity of Frauds in Collection, and not without
some in point of Estate and Quality, broken men thinking
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55344:16"/>
it, and too often affecting a Credit, by being returned in
the <hi>Poll-book</hi> of that value, which in truth they may not
be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Such as are raised by <hi>Benevolence,</hi> are the worst
of Taxes, and this of <hi>Free Gift</hi> is of double consideration.
First, as it is from the <hi>Subj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ct</hi> to the <hi>Prince,</hi> and then as it is
from the <hi>People</hi> one to another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Benevolence</hi> from the <hi>Subject</hi> to the <hi>Prince</hi> is dangerous,
in that it brings men under discrimination; he that gives
not largely, perhaps beyond his ability, will be looked
upon as diss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cted. And such is the unlimitedness of
this way of taxing, that Men have no Rule whereby
they may be safe, but shall, it may be, be compared to
Men of twice their Estates, or that which is worse, with
<hi>Sycophants,</hi> Fools of the times, who are extravagant in
their Contributions to that Government, which refunds them
equally to their Service.</p>
                  <p>That of <hi>Benevolence</hi> one to the other is a frequent Tax
in the Kingdom, and in my opinion one of the greatest Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes
in our Government.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing more common than this, given by
Authority, for Losses by Five, and other general Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
I seldom see it for Losses at Sea, though they are
yearly much greater than those by Fire. But to return,
this way of raising Money by <hi>Benevolence</hi> to relieve one
another, is a Tax on the best men, and an impu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ity on
the worst. Good men are apt to commiserate the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities
of their Neighbours, when bad men too often
rejoice at them, and seldome give any thing to relieve
them; 'tis God only that can regulate the Affections;
Man can compel the outward Conformity. And there
seems in nothing a greater want of the aid of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
than in this of Payments to any publick use, the
want of which renders honest men a Sacrifice for uncharitable
Misers.</p>

Men at liberty. The Government are best Judges of
what the Poor should receive, and the Rich pay; and if
that were thought convenient, it seems to me most equall,
where every one should give to the Relief of his distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Neighbour, according to his Worldly Substance, not
Christian Charity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Impositions upon Men for their Religion, seems
no good way of Taxes. Indeed the truly conscientious
Man will think that well bestow'd which purchases the
Exercise of his Religion, but that is no warrant for imposing
it. We may say, under the Gospel, that which <hi>David</hi>
could not under the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with that which cost him nothing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I so much doubt my Judgment in my own Province,
that I dare not intrude into that Sacred one of Divinity:
but think it allowable to take any choice of Opinions in
this matter, and with those I join that think no Errour in
Fundamentals should be allowed in a Christian Church,
nor any difference in Circumstantials purchased by
Money.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly, Monopolies</hi> are an ill way of raising Money;
for any Set of People to have the particular selling of any
Commodity, or using any Arts, though they pay a great
Rent to the Government, is yet a great Prejudice and
Tax to the People, where no <hi>Industry</hi> should be restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                  <p>Yet I am of Opinion against them that think the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key,
Hamborough, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and so far from hindering a <hi>Publick Good,</hi> that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
those Trades in the Kingdom, which would be torn
to pieces by a con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>used and general Trade: It was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in the time, when the <hi>East India Trade</hi> was at large;
but this requires an ample Discourse of it self.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:55344:17"/>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> I take the Alteration in the value of Money to
be a Tax, and no good one. We are less afflicted with
that than any People in the World; yet some little touches
we have had, rather by accident than design, so needs the
less to be said on them; but whereever 'tis used, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
is the Sufferer; for, call <hi>Money</hi> what you will, it has
its Standard in the World, and is no more than what
other Nations account it, according to its <hi>Intrinsick Value,</hi>
not what Name any <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Government</hi> gives it.</p>
                  <p>Now, if a Prince, as the <hi>French</hi> often do, raise <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi>
in Name, the <hi>Landlord</hi> and <hi>Officer,</hi> that receive Fees
and Pensions, are the <hi>Losers.</hi> The Merchant and Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
lose but once, by as much as they have in their
hands, at first coming out of the Charge; but those men
of real Estates are Losers, as long as it lasts, for that
they must take it for what the <hi>Government</hi> calls it; but
the Merchant and Tradesmen will not, because they put
a value upon their Commodities accordingly. If the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
makes <hi>twenty</hi> shillings <hi>three</hi> and <hi>twenty,</hi> the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
will have <hi>three and twenty shillings</hi> for <hi>twenty shillings</hi>
worth of Commodities: So that he must value it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as it bears with the <hi>Intrinsick Value;</hi> for in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to that he buys and sells throughout the World,
however Kings and Governments give Names to their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Coins. So we see it in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> where
they reckon their Cash by <hi>Livres</hi> or <hi>Crowns,</hi> and in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
by <hi>Gilders,</hi> and Pound <hi>Flemish;</hi> yet still the <hi>Merchant</hi>
rules himself by the Standard in <hi>England,</hi> which is thought
the best in <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Raising Money from <hi>Travellers</hi> and <hi>Passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi>
over <hi>Bridges</hi> and through <hi>Cities,</hi> as they do much in
<hi>Holland,</hi> seems an unequal Tax, and subject to great Frauds.
I take it to be unequal, because generally 'tis the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
and most industrious that are liable to it, and
perhaps it often reaches those that are travailing to find
out Charity, or labour for a Living. Now, to exact
from them, before they have purcha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed it, is a Severity
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55344:17"/>
equal to that of making Brick without Straw or
Stubble.</p>
                  <p>'Tis liable to great Frauds, since '<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>is impossible to
have a check; so that the Gatherers are under great
temptations, and the Collectors being men of mean qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
are ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er to be seduced.</p>
                  <p>Those Taxes seem most beneficial to the Government
which pass through few and most solvent hands. And,
as 'tis secure for the State, so 'tis most easie for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
and the better that Impositions are collected,
the more are the People disburthened from new Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies.</p>
                  <p>I sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll now come to shew what are thought in other
Kingdoms most advisable, and they are these.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> That of Excise, which is most used in the <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Provinces,</hi> which we should here think intolerable, to
be laid on every Bit which we eat; but there it is found
useful, and time has made it natural to the People<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so
in <hi>Venice</hi> and other parts. The great Duke of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
does the same, by raising most of his Revenue
upon <hi>Consumptions</hi> in his own Dominions, which indeed
seems of all Taxes the most equal: for that no man by
it can be said to be oppressed, he being his own Asses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor,
and pays but what he pleases, according to his
Expence: But laying it, as they do in the <hi>Vnited Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,</hi>
upon the food of the Poor, might be thought a
Grievance. If that, and one Defect more, could be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied,
there could be nothing said against this Tax;
and that is, the Rich Miser (who starves his miserable
Body) goes most free; therefore, as to him, I have
before given my Opinion, how he might be reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>Where this Excise is most used, Importations and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portations
are most eased, by which means Trade is
greatly improved, and at the same time, the Levies to
the King or State much augmented; for that the expence
of those Merchants and Seamen that repair thither, tho'
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55344:18"/>
they often sell nothing, but come to see a Market, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> In other Countries <hi>Iews</hi> are particularly tax'd,
and for which there seems good reason, for that no
Tax hardly reaches them, but like the Misers before spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of, they are indeed beyond them, for that Excise touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not them; they neither eat nor drink with <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi>
a few Eggs or Herbs are most of their Food; live
sordidly, and spend little; have no Lands or Rents to
be reached by any Tax: Nor is their Trade profitable to
a Kingdom, or advantagious to the Revenue, dealing most
in <hi>Bills of Exchange, Iewels,</hi> and <hi>concealable Commodities,</hi>
that pay no Duty.</p>
                  <p>These men should be reached by a particular Tax, and
so made profitable to a Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In some places the Government maintains
<hi>Playhouses</hi> and Matters of Sport and Recreation, paying
the Actors Salaries, and taking the profit into their
Treasures: and in other parts, as in <hi>Holland,</hi> the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
have one that takes part of what is given by Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators;
so that they make a <hi>Gain</hi> out of that waste Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
for no better can I term it. If a Calculation was
made of all the Money spent in <hi>England,</hi> by such Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
it might be thought, a round Sum might be raised
to the King. Does it not seem an omission, That a
<hi>Playhouse</hi> which receives <hi>twenty thousand pounds a year,</hi> should
pay nothing to the Publick; when a <hi>Coffeehouse,</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
not <hi>one thousand per annum,</hi> pays <hi>twenty pounds?</hi>
And so it is in <hi>Musick houses, Bear-gardens,</hi> and <hi>Plays</hi> in
<hi>Fairs, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> In some parts of the World, as <hi>Italy, France,</hi>
and <hi>Spain,</hi> a Tax of Labour upon <hi>Malefactors</hi> condemns such
as we here punish with <hi>Death,</hi> to the Gall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is a Punishment of greater terror and longer example than
<hi>Death,</hi> and at the same time, of profit to the Kingd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m I have
often thought upon this particular, and spent hours in debate
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55344:18"/>
with my self, and therefore shall beg your patience, if I
trouble you with a tedious <hi>Harangue</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> part of my
Conceptions.</p>
                  <p>I have enquired first into the Law of God, then into
that of other Kingdoms, and find that we differ from
both in our punishment for <hi>Felonies.</hi> The Law of <hi>Muses,</hi>
which is more severe than ours in many things, (as that
of <hi>Adultery</hi> and <hi>Disobedience</hi> to <hi>Parents,</hi> the latter of which
is by our Law not so <hi>penal</hi> as a broken Head) yet in <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies</hi>
n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t so extream as we are; so far from making it
<hi>Death,</hi> as not to i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>flict a Corporal Punishment. The
restoring of four-fold was directed by the Great Judge of
Heaven and Earth; and if the <hi>Thief</hi> had nothing to make
satisfaction with, he was to be sold. But our Laws and
Customs differ much, when we punish the Kingdom for
the fault of an evil Member. It will not be denied, but
that the Treasure of Men is of more value than that
of Money.</p>
                  <p>Now, to take away the Life of a Man, is in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
equal to a mans cutting off a Limb, because it
is sore. A <hi>Thief</hi> is a Diseased Member, better to be
cured than destroyed. 'T will be thought an extravagant
fancy, yet to me it seems a real truth, That a <hi>Thief</hi> is
less mischievous to a Body Politi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

he only makes a wrong transferring of Riches, the other
(I mean the <hi>Miser)</hi> keeps all buried, so that the <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
is wronged by him, and only particular Persons by the
other; and, as the taking away the Life of a Man wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
the Kingdom, so does it injure the person robbed;
for that if the <hi>Thief</hi> were not able to pay, then might
he be sold, and kept at work in Mines, or other Penal
Labour, both for satisfaction to the Person injured, and
Corporal Punishment to the Offender: And, it may be
thought to be of more terror, to have a Spectacle for
many years labouring with a shaved Head in Chains, than
an <hi>Execution</hi> of half an hour, that is oftentimes soon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ott <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:55344:19"/>I have named but these four Heads for all the Foreign

                     </gap> waies they have, any other practicable and
profitable in these Kingdoms. The two later of these we
do not use; but I presume, if they were taken into the
consideration of better Heads than mine, they might find
a way to make something out of them: forasmuch as I
am able to judge, a great Revenue might be made to
accrew to the Kingdom, out of the Vermin of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
lewd Persons of both Sexes, which now pass as if
tolerated in their <hi>Enormities;</hi> and only one Sett of them
that the Law seems severe against, punishing them with Death:
