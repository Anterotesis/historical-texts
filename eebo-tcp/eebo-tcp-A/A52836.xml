         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

then to merit the good Will

cultivate a Friendſhip
which had been heretofore
Hereditary between Your
Majeſties Kingdom and
this Republick; ſo, we were beyond meaſure troubled
when we ſaw Your Majeſty exaſperated against

Your Subjects and Ours have been overwhelmed
with thoſe miſeries which are inſeparable from War,

and brought to ſhed that bloud which hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
dear to either ſide. The ſad experience we
had thereof on both parts in the preceding War, had
given us cauſe to believe at the ſame time, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
we were re-united, the Peace would be a bleſsing
which was no more to be raviſhed from us. And we
were the rather perſwaded of it, becauſe the New
Alliances we were entred into, ſeemed able to make
our Union eternal: But ſeeing Divine Providence,
for the chastiſement of the two Nations, hath
permitted that things ſhould not continue long in
that happy eſtate, we no ſooner perceived a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understanding
ariſe, but we thought our
ſelves obliged to uſe all imaginable endeavours to
stop the progreſs of it, and to omit nothing that
might contribute to the preventing ſo great an
evil as that of a Rupture. In order to which,
being certainly informed that Your Majeſty was
offended at a Medall, which we had not ſuffered
to be ſold, but that we thought it very innocent,
we immediately ſuppreſſed it, and cauſed the very
Stamps to be broken for fear there might be
ſome made ſecretly; And to give Your Majesty
more eſſential proofs of the esteem we had of Your
Friendſhip, we yielded to Your Majeſty whatever
You were pleaſed to demand of us in behalf of
the inhabitants of <hi>Surinam,</hi> how prejudicial ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the thing were to us, and whatſoever reaſon we
otherwiſe had not to conſent to it. At the ſame
time we ſent the Sieur <hi>Van Beuningen</hi> to Your
Majesty for removing, if it were poſsible, the
ſiniſter impreſsions which ſome laboured to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95126:4"/>
poſſeſs Your Majesty with, and for perfecting a
Regulation propoſed by Your Majeſties Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
between Your <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company and Ours.
Since that, although the little ſucceſs which the ſaid
Sieur <hi>Van Beuningens</hi> Negotiation had had, gave
us but too great cauſe to fear that we ſhould not
ſucceed better for the future; yet we no ſooner un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
that there were ſome who would perſwade
Your Majesty as well against all likelihood of
truth, as truth it ſelf, That we treated under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
with <hi>France</hi> to the prejudice of Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
intereſts, but we gave order without delay
to our Ambaſſador with Your Majeſty, to declare
to Your Majesty in our name, That to ſhew the
falſhood of thoſe reports which were ſpread abroad
to our diſadvantage, and to give Your Majesty
eſſential and unquestionable marks of the ſincerity
of our intentions, we were ready to enter into ſuch
an Alliance with You as You ſhould think fit, how
strict ſoever it ſhould be, and to go far beyond
any thing we had hitherto done, for ſecuring the
Peace of <hi>Europe.</hi> Then followed the affair of the
Flagg, wherein we think our conduct hath been
with all imaginable reſpect towards Your Majeſties
Perſon: And although the Anſwer we gave to
Your Ambaſſadors Memorial be ſuch as we ſhall
always be ready to ſubmit to the judgment of all
<hi>Europe,</hi> Yet upon complaint that it was obſcure
and inſufficient, we ſent an Ambaſſador Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
to Your Majeſty, and gave power to him,
as alſo to our Ordinary Ambaſſador, to clear what
ſhould be thought obſcure, and to adde what ſhould
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95126:5"/>
be neceſſary: But inſtead of entring into regular
Conferences with them, and letting them know what
was defective in our Anſwer, they were neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and no Conference granted them upon the
point which might have ended all our differences,
till an hour after Your Majeſties Declaration of
War had been read and approved in Your Council.</p>
            <p>All this, <hi>SIRE,</hi> doth ſufficiently evidence,
with what application and zeal we have laboured
to ſatisfie your Majeſty, and to extinguiſh in its
birth a Fire which is ready to conſume all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
And as we have not entred into this War but
from an indiſpenſable neceſsity of defending and
protecting our Subjects, we have ever ſince the
Rupture, as much as we were able, ſought Your
Majeſties Friendſhip, and never given over the
making overtures of Peace. Upon which account
we ſent our Deputies Extraordinary to Your
Majeſty in the moneth of <hi>June</hi> of the year laſt
paſt, who were confined to <hi>Hampton Court,</hi>
without having any Audience given them, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
heard what they had to ſay on our part.
A Miniſter from the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi>
paſſed alſo into <hi>England</hi> upon the ſame ſubject,
and charged himſelf, at our requeſt, with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting
to Your Majeſty the ardent deſire we
had to ſee Your Majesty entertain other ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and our diſpoſition to do any thing in our
power to acquire again the honour of Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
good Correſpondence. Since that, upon the
Propoſition made by the Mediators of a general
Truce, for as much as according to our judgment
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95126:5"/>
we could not conſent to it without hazarding
the Safety of our State; yet, to evidence to
Your Majeſty how great a deſire we had to give
You all poſsible marks of our Reſpect, and to the
end to procure to Your Subjects all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
which they could have received from a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Truce, we offered one by Sea to Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
for the term of a year, or a longer time,
if Your Majeſty thought it convenient; judging,
that in the condition things were then in, we could
not give a greater proof of the ardent paſsion
we had to ſmooth the way to a happy Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then by putting all Your Majeſties Subjects
into a condition of tasting the ſweetneſs of Peace,
while ours ſhould ſuffer all the incommodities of
War. The Miniſters of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> have
repreſented from time to time the ſame things to
Your Majesty, and have often repeated their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
to incline Your Majesty to Peace; But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
all theſe advances, and the ſteps we have
made in publick, we have made uſe of other means
which we judged more efficacious: And His High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> as well of his own
inclination, as at the requeſt we have ſeveral
times reiterated to him, hath uſed all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ways of regaining the honour of Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
friendſhip for us, and repreſenting to You
the advantage and glory Your Majesty might
acquire, by re-establiſhing the Quiet of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and giving us a Peace which we had ſo
often and ſo ardently deſired. But albeit vve
had all reaſon to hope, that the instances of a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95126:6"/>
Prince who hath the honour to be ſo nearly related
to Your Majesty, and whoſe perſonal merit is ſo well
known, would at laſt prevail over thoſe who are ill-affected
to us; and that beſides we could hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that after His Highneſſes interests and ours
were become common and were no longer ſeparate in
any thing, Your Majesty would retain Your former
ſentiments, and go about to involve in our ruine one
of the most Illuſtrious Princes of Your bloud; we have
nevertheleſs with great ſorrow ſeen that all theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
have been alike weak, and that Your Majesty
hath not been induced by any motive to abate any
thing of Your first rigour. So that when we expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a favourable Anſwer to our Overtures, it hath
been declared to us at <hi>Cologne,</hi> that no Peace was
to be hoped, unleſs there were accorded not onely to
Your Majeſty and the Moſt Chriſtian King, but
alſo to the Elector of <hi>Cologne</hi> and the Biſhop of
<hi>Munſter,</hi> ſuch Conditions as never were demanded
of a Free People, and which can ſo little be propoſed
as Articles of Peace, that they can onely be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
of an Abſolute Conquest, the ſubverſion of
the Reformed Religion, of which Your Majesty and
the Kings Your most Illustrious Predeceſſors have
been the strongest Support and Defenders, and which
carried with them at once the utter ruine not onely
of us, but alſo of the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> belonging to
the King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This hath obliged us on our ſide, after we had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
upon a neceſſary defence, to preſs our
Friends to enter into a stricker Alliance with us;
And it hath pleaſed God ſo to bleſs our endeavours,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95126:6"/>
and the means we have uſed in order thereunto, that
the moſt Auguſt Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> hath declared in
our favour, and the most Serene King of <hi>Spain</hi> in
particular hath concluded with us a League Offenſive
and Defenſive, in purſuance whereof he hath already
declared War againſt the King of <hi>France.</hi> Things
being thus, <hi>SIRE,</hi> Your Majeſty will eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that the conſequences muſt be greater, but before
the evil be paſt remedy we thought fit to make one
final eſſay, and to aſſure Your Majeſty that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
change hath hapned in <hi>Europe,</hi> our deference
and reſpect for Your Majesty is still the ſame; and
that how conſiderable and how potent ſoever our
Allies are, we are not the leſs diſpoſed to give Your
Majeſty all the ſatisfaction which You can reaſonably
pretend; And we have this happineſs, that our Allies
are of the ſame mind with us herein; we preſume there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to hope that Your Majesty will not refuſe at our
request and their interceſsion, what we have not
been hitherto able to obtain; And that You will not
augment the deſolation which is already but too
univerſal.</p>
            <p>But that we may omit nothing that may diſpoſe
Your Majeſty thereunto, we beſeech You to reflect
upon all that hath paſſed ſince the beginning of the
War, and at the ſame time to conſider that it is from
a particular one become general. When Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
engaged in it we were the onely Enemies; At
preſent a great part of <hi>Europe</hi> is no leſs intereſſed
therein then we; And Your Majeſty cannot continue a
War, which hath already been ſo ruinous, without

the Arms of the King of <hi>France</hi> ſhould be victorious
through the ſuccours given by Your Majeſty to him.
And Your Majeſty can no longer take it ill that we

manner of ſending it by a

at <hi>Cologne</hi> were in frequent Conferences
with Our Plenipotentiaries there, have more of
the nature of a Manifeſt then a Letter, and that
conſequently you may not perhaps deſire to
have any Anſwer made to it; yet for the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
of Our Honour, as well as for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceiving
that part of the World which may
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95126:8"/>
be abuſed by it, We would not ſuffer it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
without a diſtinct Reply from point to
point as they lie in your Paper (which We ſend
you by the ſame hand that brought Us yours;)
and the rather becauſe it may ſo have fallen out,
that by the great revolutions which have lately
hapned in your affairs and the change of your
Miniſters, even your ſelves may have taken for
truth what evil-minded perſons have ſo mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly
ſuggeſted to you, thereby to ſeduce your
own people as well as Ours.</p>
            <p>There will need no great proofs to convince
the World that many offenſive Medalls, Inſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions
and Libels were theſe laſt years paſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed
every where in your Provinces, to the
derogation of Our Honour, and that of the
whole <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, ſince the notoriety of
them was ſo univerſal: but to this day neither
We nor any body elſe knew you had diſowned
any part of them, until your aforeſaid Letter
told Us you had at the time they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of to your Ambaſſador here, cauſed the
Stamps to be broken for fear new Impreſſions
ſhould be ſecretly made by them; neither do
you yet tell Us that ever you inflicted the leaſt
Puniſhment upon the makers or diſperſers of
them.</p>
            <p>As to the affair of <hi>Surinam;</hi> Could you make
the World or Our People believe what in this
Paper you affirm, your ſelves would have out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
your Medalls, and would be more inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
then they, faſtning a Reproach upon Us
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95126:8"/>
which We have been as far from deſerving, as
you, We hope, will be from being believed in
the accuſation. You ſay, you agreed to whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
We demanded in favour of Our Subjects
remaining at <hi>Surinam.</hi> Did We not continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
preſs their Releaſe from the time of Our
Surrendring that place into your hands till the
beginning of this preſent War, and is there not
yet the greater part of them remaining there?
Are they there detained your Slaves at Our
deſire? Did We ſend Our Ships thither onely
for a colour, with intention to ſubject them to
your Tyranny more entirely and with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
decency? and not to deliver them from it?
Was not the Officer We ſent thither, Major
<hi>Baniſter,</hi> confined preſently upon his arrival, and
not ſuffer'd to ſpeak with his Countrey-men,
or acquaint them with the care We had of them?
Did he not Proteſt againſt the Governor for
having broken the Capitulation in Eighteen ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
points? And will you ſay all this was
done according to what We deſired? Had
you been ſo tender of the bloud of both Nations
as in your Paper you pretend, you would not ſo
long and with ſo much obſtinacy have perſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in oppreſſing thoſe Our Subjects whom you
detain in that Colony. And it is manifeſt that
if you could caſt all the blame hereof upon Vs,
<gap reason="illegible: scratched out" resp="#TECH" extent="2 words">
                  <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
               </gap> you have a mind to do it. All We can
ſay therefore to this your aſſertion is, That you
have indeed granted Vs in words all We ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but that We have never obtained any thing
of you in deeds.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:95126:9"/>
What followed, was the pretended Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you ſay you offered at all times to make
Vs in relation to the Trade of Our Subjects in
the <hi>East-Indies.</hi> It was ſolemnly promiſed by
the Treaty of <hi>Breda,</hi> that things ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted
by Commiſsioners to be ſent hither by
you when there ſhould be more leiſure for it.
But you well know that Our Ambaſſador
whom We ſent after the ſaid Treaty to
reſide with you, could obtain nothing in that
matter by all his inſtances that could in any
wiſe ſatisfie Our <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company. Nor
did the Sieur <hi>Van Beuningen,</hi> who ſeemed to
have come hither expreſly upon that account,
offer any more in all his Conferences with Our
Commiſsioners upon that ſubject. It is true,
the Ambaſſador <hi>Boreel</hi> produced here a full
Power from you to treat and conclude an Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
and Defenſive League with Vs, but We
could not accept the Propoſition, becauſe the
conditions of it were not ſufficiently equitable,
and that inſtead of giving Vs ſatisfaction in Our
complaints, he would never ſo much as admit
of their being mentioned. On the contrary,
his whole diſcourſe tended to nothing elſe but to
perſwade Vs that the States General offered Vs
this League as a mark of their Friendſhip and
for Our ſecurity alone, ſeeming indifferent
whether it were accepted or not; and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
continually the greatneſs of your For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
by Land and Sea, as ſufficient to defend you
againſt the formidable power of <hi>France;</hi> and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95126:9"/>
often threatning Vs, that you could make ſuch
a League whenſoever you pleaſed with <hi>France,</hi>
and even againſt Vs, if We accepted not what
his Maſters offered Vs. The ſum of theſe
two points is, That the Sieur <hi>Van Beuningen</hi>
was pleaſed to diſcourſe concerning the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
demanded by Vs in point of Trade in
the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> but departed without offering
any thing; and the Sieur <hi>Boreel</hi> offered Us
a League Offenſive and Defenſive, without
giving Vs Satisfaction for the paſt Injuries, or
ſecurity againſt future; And all this to the end
the Injuries We had complained of that till then
were peculiarly your acts, might by a ſolemn
Treaty be declar'd Our own.</p>
            <p>The next matter of offence given Us was (as
you well obſerve in your Letter) the affront
committed againſt Our Flagg in the moneth of
<hi>Auguſt</hi> 1671. Complaint was made thereof
to your Ambaſſador reſiding here, and he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
Us he would procure Us a fair ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thereupon: but three or four moneths time
paſſing without the leaſt notice being taken
thereof by you, We held Our Self obliged to
ſend Our Extraordinary Ambaſſador to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
Satisfaction of you in more earneſt terms
then We had done before; To which not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
any ſatisfactory Anſwer, he had order
to return. Soon after he was followed by an
Extraordinary Ambaſſador from you, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
that he had no Powers to make repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for this affront, or any other of theſe things
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95126:10"/>
We had ſo often complained of, but to agree up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
terms of Regulation in the buſineſs of the
Flagg for the future; yet ſaying withall, that of
himſelf and without conſulting you again he
could not put any thing in writing concerning it.
The arrival of the ſaid Ambaſſador Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
was about the time We were ready to
make open Declaration of War againſt your
State; which We could no longer delay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Spring was coming on, and the ſaid
Ambaſſador perſiſted that his Inſtructions per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
him not to do any thing upon Our
Demands; neither was he able to produce any
thing to juſtifie his delay, but the offering Us
to write to his Maſters for larger Powers and
Inſtructions.</p>
            <p>The War following upon this, In the heat of
it Three Deputies arrived here from you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Paſsports from Us, or giving Us notice
of their coming according to the Cuſtoms and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
of War. Whereupon We might well have
confined them (as you ſay We did) but We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
Our Self with warning them to abſtain
from coming to lodge in this Our City, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
them inſtead thereof Lodgings in Our
Palace of <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> with all other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
ſuitable to their Character, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
what We knew paſſed between them
and perſons they practiſed upon to cauſe tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults
and diſorders in Our City, or to diſturb
the progreſs of the War. Notwithſtanding
which, We forbore not to ſend to them ſome
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95126:10"/>
of the Principal perſons of Our Council to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
with them and hear their Propoſals.
To whom they made this onely Anſwer, and
perſiſted therein to the time of their departure,
that they had no Authority or Inſtructions to
make any Propoſitions, but were content to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to thoſe that ſhould be made to them, and
to tranſmit them to their Maſters; hoping that
while they amuſed Us with this appearance,
the Deputies you had ſent at the ſame time
to the Moſt Chriſtian King might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
a ſeparate Treaty with him.</p>
            <p>And can you flatter your ſelves with the
opinion that the World ſhould look upon this
proceeding as a convincing proof of your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
deſires for Peace? Did ever Prince or
State ſend an Ambaſſador with deſign to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that which the Ambaſſador was not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered
either to conclude or ſign, eſpecially
to a Prince with whom they had War? It is much
more rational to believe what you did was to
gain time, whilſt you endeavoured to put in
execution thoſe threats in relation to <hi>France</hi>
that the Sieur <hi>Boreel</hi> had before given Us.</p>
            <p>The Miniſter of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> never decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that he came hither to make Us any over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of Peace, or that he had any other
Commiſſion then to incline Us at the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of His Maſter to hearken to thoſe
that ſhould be made Us. He came hither at
the time that the Ambaſſador Extraordinary
of His moſt Serene Majeſty the King of <hi>Sweden</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:95126:11"/>
arrived, in order to the offering Us the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iation
of their Maſter, which We readily
embraced, as likewiſe a Propoſition made by
them to Us for a Suſpenſion of Arms. But a
little after when they propoſed the ſame thing
to you, you thought fit abſolutely to reject
the Suſpenſion; and were ſo long bargaining
upon the choice of a place for treating the
Peace, that many moneths paſſed without
producing any other effect then your gaining your
point in naming the City of <hi>Cologne</hi> for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs:
Which being agreed to, and Our Fleet
ready to put to Sea, you ſent Us word you
would then accept a Ceſſation of Arms by
Sea. To which We found Our Self obliged
to make anſwer, That a Peace might be made
in much leſs time then the terms of a Partial
Suſpenſion be agreed upon; although it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to Us a meer artifice, invented onely
to charm the Common Peoples ears, and
make Us conſume unprofitably all Our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
for equipping Our Fleet. In a
word, when Our Merchants might really have
received benefit by a Suſpenſion, you abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
refuſed it, and would then onely yield
to it when you ſaw your Provinces like to ſuffer
by the progreſs of the War.</p>
            <p>The Miniſters of <hi>Spain</hi> never offered Us
any Conditions, nor performed any other
office, then in general terms to incline Us to
the thoughts of Peace, which We ever accepted
kindly from them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:95126:11"/>
Neither did Our Nephew the Prince of
<hi>Orange</hi> ever make Us any Overtures for Peace:
We muſt needs avow, That the manner of
your Comportment towards him till the year
laſt paſt, was no very good Argument to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
Us, that your intentions of living in a
good Correſpondence with Us, were real and
ſincere: And although We were unwilling to
ſhew Our reſentment of his uſage publiquely,
leſt We ſhould give occaſion to his Enemies to
do him more harm; yet ſo ſoon as the good
will of the People prevailing againſt the <hi>Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vestein</hi>
Party, had Conferred upon him that
Power and Authority in the Government
which his Anceſtors had ſo well merited, We
applied Our ſelf with more Zeal and Efficacy
to make the Peace; being further incited there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
by the unexpected Succeſs of the Arms
by Land of the moſt Chriſtian King. We
forth with ſent Ambaſſadors Extraordinary to
him, to be preſent at the Treaty; which the
<hi>Louveſtein</hi> Party would have managed to the
Excluding of Us, if the Vertue and Generoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of that Prince would have permitted him to
admit it: But ſo ſoon as Our Ambaſſadors
were ſeen upon the place, the Deputies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
themſelves, and never after appeared;
following that fundamental maxim you had
laid from the beginning of this War, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
Us by any kind of Artifices, thereof to
make your own advantage.</p>
            <p>As to your inſinuation of Our intention to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95126:12"/>
ruine Our Nephew the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi>
you know your ſelves ſufficiently the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of that reproach. And whilſt at <hi>Cologne</hi>
you openly complain to the Mediators that
We are too zealous in advancing His Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts,
you would have Our Subjects believe
We are guilty of ill nature towards him.
And the better to improve this abuſe you adde,
without giving or having any the leaſt ground
for it, that Our demands at <hi>Cologne</hi> tend to the
ſubverſion of the Proteſtant Religion, and the
ruine of Our Nephews family. We cannot
conclude Our remarks upon this Letter or
Manifeſt framed by you with deſign to abuſe
your people and Ours, and involved in terms
of reſpect for Our Perſon, and fair words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
a Peace, without adding what ought
to be convincing to the moſt obſtinate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
you; At the ſame time you would
perſwade Us to break Our Word and Faith
given to Our Allies, Not to Treat ſeparately,
you eſtabliſh it for a Fundamental point, that
you cannot break the word you have given
yours, without wronging your honour; as
if your honour ought always to be dear to
you, but Ours of little or no value with Us.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, you make the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of your Deputies at <hi>Cologne</hi> to paſs for
the faireſt and moſt ingenuous that may be,
reproaching that of Our Plenipotentiaries as
rude and inſincere; ſaying, That notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all your endeavours, We would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95126:12"/>
yet abate of Our firſt rigour. Herein
We appeal to the Mediators themſelves, who
will not be wanting to do Us juſtice in let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the World know, that Our ſaid Pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentiaries
have retrenched at leaſt one half
of their firſt demands, whilſt yours have
continually excuſed themſelves from giving
an anſwer upon any one of them, except that of
the Flagg, with which they ſeem inclined
to gratifie Us for the future, but in terms
very equivocal, and which ſhall not take
notice of any right We ever had to it for
the time paſt: And this is the onely thing
you have ſhewn the leaſt diſpoſition to yield
to Us during the whole courſe of this Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation:
And having made no further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
in the overtures of Peace which you
ſay you made Us by Our Nephew the
Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> the Miniſters of <hi>Spain</hi> and
<hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> and by thoſe of the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
themſelves, you do not ſo much as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
one word of it in your ſaid Letter;
handling the matter of the Peace in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
terms, to acquire to your ſelves the
reputation of it, and not making Us one
Propoſition but that of dividing Us from
Our Allies; an Action which you eſteem
too low for a Common-wealth, but ſuitable
enough to a King.</p>
            <p>If you have a deſire to promote the Peace
