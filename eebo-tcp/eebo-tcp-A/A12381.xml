         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The like, yea and
<pb facs="tcp:14113:3"/>
greater regarde ought wee to haue of our solues, which being not crasie one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, or lightlie affected with sinne, but sick euen vnto death: had neede to be prepared with threats and exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, comforts and consolations, one way or other, that they may bee made fit not to receiue the preparatiue, but the perfection of happie saluation. And for this cause haue I made choise of this part of Scripture, as of a light to shine vnto vs in darkenesse, a direction to our steps, and a Lanthorne to our pathes; while we wander through the boistrous waues of this wicked world. The Text is plaine, and obiect to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie mans capacitie, naturallie budding into blossomes: The first containing our dutie which wee are to performe towards God: The second, Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, if we performe this dutie.</p>
                  <p>Our dutie towards God is implied in these three conditions. First, <hi>If thou wilt earlie seeke vnto God.</hi> Secondlie, <hi>If thou wilt pray vnto the Almightie.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,

                        <hi>Diuision.</hi>
                     </note> so that the whole consisteth on these three points. First, what it is that God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, namelie, a diligent and speedie searche in these words: <hi>If thou wilt seeke earlie.</hi> Secondlie, how thy search is to be made in praier, in these words. <hi>If thou wilt pray to the Almightie.</hi> Thirdlie, what effect these thinges ought to worke in vs, a puritie and sinceritie of life, in these words: <hi>If thou bee pure and vpright.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As our dutie towards God consisteth in three points, so Gods blessings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs, is also threefold answerable to the same. First for seeking, hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth; <hi>he will awake vnto thee.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, for praying vnto him, <hi>hee will make the habitations of thy righteousnes prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</hi> Thirdly, for being pure and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, <hi>hee will make thy latter end encrease exceedinglie:</hi> yea, though thy begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning be but small.</p>
                  <p>First therfore concerning the search,<note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:14113:5"/>
the wise Merchant was content not onely to seek, but to sell all that he had to buie it. God hath placed vs heere in this world as husbandmen, to plough vp the fallow of our hearts; as labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers to worke in his vineyard: as trauai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers to seeke a countrie, as souldiours to fight the battaile of the Lord against the flesh, the world, and the deuil. And for this purpose hath he proposed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, an vntilled land, a vineyard, a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple enemie to fight against: that wee might remember, that we must till the ground, if we will reape the fruit: that wee must prune the Vine, if wee will drinke of the grape: that we must fight if we will ouercome.<note place="margin">Prou 28.</note> 
                     <hi>He that tilleth the land</hi> (saith the wise man) <hi>shall be satisfied with bread: but he that followeth idlenesse, shalbe filled with pouertie.</hi> Idlenesse is a moath or canker of the minde, and the fruites thereof are wicked cogitations, euill affections, and worse actions: cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt trees without fruite,<note place="margin">Iude. <hi>1.</hi> Pro. 24.</note> twice dead, and plucked vp by the roote, engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring

                  <p>Eschue therefore idlenesse I beseech yee, and by the want ye find in others, learne instructions for your selues. Be not forgetfull how busie your enemie is, if he finde yee idle: first hee putteth yee in minde of some vanitie: then of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth opportunitie to practise: then he craueth consent; and if yee graunt him that, hee triumpheth by adding practise: hee leaueth no meanes vnat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, whereby he may subuert and bring yee to perdition.<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> To one (as to Eua) hee promiseth the knowledge of good and euill: Another he seduceth with lying speeches,<note place="margin">Exo. 7.27.</note> as he did Pharaoh the king, whom hee deceiued by false Prophets.

death. Flie idlenesse therefore, and seeke vertue, and the way therof: seeke learning as for a iewell, make diligent search and inquisition after hir: seeke earlie and seeke late. In the morning sowe thy seede, and in the euening let not thy hand rest: seeke him in the day of trouble, and hee will deliuer thee, and thou shalt glorifie him. Seeke him; there is the commaundement: hee will deliuer thee; there is the promise: and thou shalt glorifie him; there is the condition. To disobey the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement is rebellion, to distrust the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise is infidelitie, to refuse the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is vile ingratitude. Wherefore let vs seeke, and seeke earnestlie, with a feruent spirit, and humblenes of heart; and let vs perswade our selues, that there is no seeking without finding, no opening without knocking.</p>

Pet. 5. Reue. 12.</note> who conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually goeth about like a roaring Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, seeking whom hee may deuoure?
<pb facs="tcp:14113:7"/>
Heere yee may note first his malice, for hee dailye accuseth vs before the cheefe Iudge of the Kings benche: when he cannot preuaile in this court, but seeth his billes of accusation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled: then hee remooueth the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Court of our owne consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, where on the one side he laieth the bookes of the lawe and statutes made against sinne: on the other side, the billes of accusation brought in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs out of the bookes of the lawe, alledging these strict places a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs: <hi>The soule that sinneth, shall dye the death: Curssed is hee that abideth not in euery pointe of the lawe, to doo it.</hi> On the other side, hee bringeth in consciences to witnesse against vs, and then inferreth this harde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion: <hi>Therefore there is no hope of saluation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then if hee see that wee appeale from iustice to mercie, and say; At what time soeuer a sinner repenteth, the Iudge putteth all his wickednesse
<pb facs="tcp:14113:7"/>
out of his remembrance, hee dealeth with vs as craftie worldlings deale in matters of lawe, who when they see their matters passe against them in higher Courtes: bring downe their case into the countrie, to bee decided by the neighbours, who, either for their simplicitie cannot, or for their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour dare not iudge of the trueth of the matter.</p>
                  <p>So our aduersarie, though GOD himselfe doo discharge vs, though our conscience testifie our innocencie: yet hee accuseth in the third Courte before men, where hee is bolde to powre out his whole venome, and poyson of his malice against vs, and to forge what lyes, and slaunders, and Libels hee list, because hee knoweth they shall bee receiued as true. Thus hee accused Christ Iesus our blessed Lorde and Sauiour before Poncius Pilate, and caused diuers false and vntrue witnesses to come in against him.</p>
                  <p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> But if hee were malicious onely to wish our destruction, and not mightie to wreake his mallice, we should haue little cause to feare:<note place="margin">Luke 11. Ephe 6. Reue. 12.</note> but hee is mightie therefore hee is termed a Lyon, the power of darknes, the great Dragon, which drew to the earth the third part of the starres of heauen: that is, with earthlye temptation to haue ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne them, which seemed to shine in the Church of God as Lampes and starres. O then how easie is our ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, if the Lord did not hold vs vp, which shine not as starres in heauen, but creepe like wormes on earth!</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Yet if hee were but malitious and mightie, it were better with vs: but he is fierce, and therefore called a roaring Lyon, who laying waite for the bloud of the godly, stirreth vp bloud-thirstie persecuters, to make themselues drunk with the bloud of the Saints: as most grieuouslie hee did from the time of Iohn Baptist, to the reigne of Maxen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, the space of 294. yeares, slaying
<pb facs="tcp:14113:8"/>
some by the sworde, burning other with fire, hanging some on the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, drowning some in Riuers, stab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some with forkes of Iron, pressing others to death with stones, deuouring many thousands of the tender Lambs of Christs flock.</p>
                  <p>To this mallice, might, and rage, is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> added his subtile policie, which hee v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth in circumuenting the faithfull, he dooth not pitch his tentes in anye one place: but walketh about from place to place, to spie out his best aduantage,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1.</note> in the night hee soweth Tares, and in the daye hee hindereth the growth thereof.</p>
                  <p>Hee proceedeth after further, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> added to his pollicie, industrie, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidereth our natures, &amp; dispositions, &amp; to what sinnes wee doe most incline: and therevnto hee applyeth himselfe, sometimes by flatterie, sometimes by feare, sometimes by feeding our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours hee subtillie entiseth vs, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by violence hee goeth about to
<pb facs="tcp:14113:9"/>
enforce vs, somtime by changing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe into an Angell of light, hee ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth to betraye our soules into his hands, and in whatsoeuer estate hee findeth vs, he thereby taketh occasion to lay siedge to our soules.</p>
                  <p>Thus yee see noted in a worde, the force of our aduersarie, examine nowe your selues, whether yee haue anye thing in your selues, and you shall find nothing but weakenesse and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is God that giueth strength to the mightie, wisdom to the prudent, &amp; knowledge to the vnderstanding: hee teacheth Dauids hand to fight, and his fingers to battaile,<note place="margin">Psal. 144.</note> hee giueth strength to his armes to breake a bowe, euen a bow of steele: wherfore let neither the wise man glory in his wisdom, nor the strong man in his strength: but let him that glorieth, glory only in the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we are to seeke vnto God alone, because none is so present as he: for God because hee is almightie, and with his power filleth both heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and
<pb facs="tcp:14113:9"/>
earth, is present alwaies with them that feare him, and readie to succour them in distresse. The Lorde is neere to all that call vpon him in truth, he heareth our gronings and sighes, and knoweth what things are necessary for vs before we aske.</p>
                  <p>The third reason why we must seeke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> vnto God, is, none is so able to helpe vs as he: but of this I shall haue parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular occasion to speake when I come to this point, <hi>and pray to the Almightie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth reason why wee must <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> seeke Christ alone, is, because there is none so willing to helpe vs as he. It is a great courage to vs to make sute, when we are perswaded of the willingnesse of him to whome we make sute: and I pray yee, who was euer more carefull for our saluation, and more watchfull ouer vs, then the Lord? who euer put his trust in him, and was confounded? In this respect he is called a Father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause as the father tendreth his sonne: so the Lorde dooth all those that put
<pb facs="tcp:14113:10"/>
their trust in him. Can there bee any more willing to helpe vs then Christ? whose whole head was sicke, and whose heart was heauie for our sakes? yea, in whose bodie, from the sole of the foote to the crowne of the head, was nothing but woundes, and swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and sores? but alas this was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to that he suffered for our sakes.</p>
                  <p>He was compassed about with feares and horrors, till his sweat was drops of bloud, &amp; his bones brused in the flesh: hee was whipped, and scourged, and chastised with sorrows, till he cried out in the bitternes of his soule: <hi>O Lord, if it be possible let this cup passe from me.</hi> The heauie hand of God was so grieuous vpon him, that it brused his very bones and rent his reines a sunder: he could finde no health in his fleshe, but was wounded, yea, wounded to the death, euen the most bitter death vpon the crosse. His tender fingers were nayled to the crosse, his face was wrinkled with weeping &amp; wailing, his sides em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brued
<pb facs="tcp:14113:10"/>
and gored with his own bloud. spurting &amp; gushing fresh from his ribs, the shadow of death was vpon his eies.</p>
                  <p>O what greefe could bee like to this, or what condemnation could bee so heauie, sith there was no wickednes in his hands? sith he was the brightnes of his fathers glorie, &amp; the sonne of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes that shined in the world: as to see his dayes at an end, to see such throbing, sighes, and carefull thoughts (without cause of his) so deeply engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in the tables of his brest. But was this all? no my brethren, sith his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency was such aboue al creatures, that the world was not worthy to giue him breath, it was a greater greef vnto him, to see himselfe made a worme and not a man, a shame of men, and contempt of the people; to see his life shut vp in shame and reproches, how could it but shake his bones out of ioint, &amp; make his heart melt in midst of his bowels: who was euer so ful of wo? &amp; who euer bin brought so low into the dust of death?
<pb facs="tcp:14113:11"/>
vpon whom did the mallice of Sathan euer get so great a conquest?</p>
                  <p>This though it were exceeding, yet it was not all, no, it was but a taste of greefe in comparison of the rest: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold therfore (if your watrie eyes will suffer yee to behold) the depth of all miseries yet behinde: the sinne that he hated he must take vpon his owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and beare the wrath of his father powred out against it. This is the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of all paines that compassed him round about, which no tongue is able to vtter, nor heart conceiue: the anger of the father burneth in him, euen to the bottome of hell, and deepe sincke of confusion: it wrapped him in the chaines of eternall death: it crucified him, and threw him downe into the bottomlesse pit of calamitie, and made his soule by weeping and wayling to melt into these bitter teares trickling from his eyes. <hi>O God my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O that my head were a Well of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb facs="tcp:14113:11"/>
and a fountaine of teares, that I might weepe day and night at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance heereof: but least I linger too long about one floure, while I haue many to gather, I will conclude this point thus in a word. Sith Christ hath suffered these, and an infinite number such like torments for our sakes: it is blasphemous once to dream or imagine any to bee more willing to helpe vs then he: nay, he is more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to heare our prayers, then we to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them vnto him, insomuch that hee complaineth by the Prophet Esay: <hi>I haue beene found of them that sought mee not,</hi>

Surely man knoweth not the path therof: the depth saith, it is not in me; the sea saith, it is not in mee: death and destruction say, wee haue heard the fame thereof with our eares: all creatures say, it is not with vs: but God vnderstandeth the way therof, and vnto man he saith: <hi>The feare of the Lorde is the beginning of wisedome,</hi>

Some beleeue not the law but the prophets: some be perswaded in the supremacie, but not in the sacrament: some in free will, but not in merit: some in inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vpon saints, but not in purgatorie; some in pilgrimages and pardons, but not in Images: some like the doctrine wel enough, but not the preachers: the most beleeue little, yet many beleeue somwhat, few beleeue all: therefore to deale plainly, because plaine dealing is best, you must not beleeue by the halfes; I meane, you must not repose some trust in God, and some in Saints, but all in the Lorde.<note place="margin">Psal. 10 5.</note> 
                     <hi>The Gods of the Gentiles they haue mouthes and speake not, eyes and see not, eares and heare not,</hi> then
<pb facs="tcp:14113:17"/>
what can be looked for at their hands? But the Lorde is strong and mightic, a mercifull God: and therefore thorow the Scriptures, hee is called a Rocke, a Fortresse,<note place="margin">Psalm. 18</note> a strong Tower, a Sheeld, a horne of saluation, a refuge, the Lorde of Hoastes, with other such like appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, that we might bee assured, that our helpe and deliuerance commeth from the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Puttest thou any trust in man, whose breath is in his nosthrils? Curssed is he that maketh man his strength,<note place="margin">Iere. 77.</note> and flesh his arme.<note place="margin">2. King. 16</note> Surely Pharaoh, and all princes are a broken staffe, on which if a man leane, it will strike into his hande and pierce it, and lay him groueling in the dust: <hi>It is better therefore to trust in the Lorde,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 118.</note> 
                     <hi>then to put anye confidence in Princes.</hi> Thinkest thou that Angels, or Saints, or Images, can helpe thee? O foolish and impious pietie, to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute more vnto the Angels, then they dare arrogate vnto themselues. The Angell in the Reuelation,<note place="margin">Reue. 19</note> forbiddeth
<pb facs="tcp:14113:17"/>
Iohn to worship him. As for the Image, we read, that to turne the glory of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible God, into the similitude of a corruptible creature, is idolatrie.<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> Well may I then affirme with Moses,<note place="margin">Deu. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>curssed be the Image and the Image maker.</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion therefore of this point, is this, that we seeke the Lord and his strength euer more, that we pray vnto God in humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and sinceritie, and in full assurance of faith continually: who without end is to be sought, because without end he is to be beloued.</p>
                  <p>The third thing contained in our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is, what effect this seeking and praying ought to worke in vs, comprehended in these wordes: <hi>If thou be pure and vpright.</hi> If the clowdes bee full, they will powre foorth raine vpon the earth: and vnpossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is it, that a man that seeketh after God and prayeth to the Almightie, should not bring foorth the fruites of a godly life; for if the tree be good, the fruits can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be bad: and if the head of the water be pure, it will send foorth pure waters into the Cesterns. Wherefore as good
<pb facs="tcp:14113:18"/>
motions are stirred vp by prayer, so must they be fostered by practise of life, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of the Apostle: <hi>Quenche not the spirit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Thes. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>nor greeue the holy one of God, by whom yee are sealed to the day of redemption.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hee quencheth dearely beloued the spirit,<note place="margin">Ephe. 4.</note> which being once lightened with the sparckles of faith, and felt Gods mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in his heart: dooth neglect to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the one to a flame, and the other to good workes in his lyfe, but with the dogs turneth to his vomit, and with the Sow that was washed, to her wallowing againe in the mire. Therefore (beloued) loue and seeke the Lord, pray to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie, be pure and vpright in conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, flie from sinne as from a serpent; for if thou come neere, it will bite thee. The teeth therof are as the teeth of a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to slay the soules of men, &amp; all iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is as a two edged sword, the wounds that it giues cannot be healed. I dare not scand as I would vpon these points, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring tediousnes: wherfore let this suffice for the former generall part, concerning the dutie we owe vnto God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:14113:18"/>Now Gods promises for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance hereof, yeeld vnto vs most plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full matter of doctrine and consolation. First, of his iustice, that as hee will suffer no sinne vnpunished: so he will leaue no good worke vnrewarded, but giueth to euery seuerall action his seuerall hyre, &amp; iust recompence of rewarde. Shall the hower come, in which all that are in their graues shall heare a voyce, &amp; come foorth: they that haue doone well, to the resurrection of life, they that haue done euill, to the resurrection of condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Shall the Lorde search Ierusalem with Lanthorns? Shall all foule corners be swept, and all pleits and wrinckles be vnfolded? Shall the sea, graue, death and hell, giue vp all that is in them? and shall all the dead (both great and small) stand before GOD, when the bookes are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened? and shall euery man haue praise of God according vnto his deseruing? Shall wee then discerne betweene the vessels of honour and of wrath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Sheepe and Goates, the iust and vniust? Finallie, shall there bee an
<pb facs="tcp:14113:19"/>
infallible, generall, and incorrupt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein the booke of al our offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces shall be laide wide open? Now God bee mercifull vnto vs:<note place="margin">Psal. 2.</note> bee fauourable O Lord, be fauourable. But to proceed, is it thy nature (O Lorde) to gather vp the wheat,<note place="margin">Math 13.15 30, 41</note> and burne the tares; to cut down all frutlesse trees, and cast them into the fire: yea, into a fierie furnace, that neuer shall bee quenched; into an vtter dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, where is weeping, wayling, and gnashing of teeth; then bee fauourable O Lord, be fauourable.</p>
                  <p>Dooth not the Lorde spare Dauid a king and a prophet, for murther? dooth he not spare the Sichemites for adultery; nor Absolon for treason? nor Saule for tyrannie? nor Elie for negligence? nor Achab, Ieroboam, nor Iezabell for cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie? nor Herod, Nabuchadnezar, and Lucifer for pride; nor Paraoh for incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulitie: then be fauourable O Lord, bee fauourable to vs, in whom almost euery one of these sinnes do dwell &amp; remaine.</p>
                  <p>Did the Lord for corruption ouerflow the world with water? did he burne So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb facs="tcp:14113:19"/>
for her villanie? did he cast Adam and Eue out of Paradise, for eating of the forbidden frute? did hee stone a poore wretch to death, for gathering chips on the Sabaoth day? then be fauourable O Lord, be fauourable vnto vs. But dooth not the Lord spare the Cedar tree for his height? nor the Oake for his strength? nor the Poplar for his smoothnes? nor the Lawrell for his greennes? No verely, from the Cedar that is in Lybanon, euen to thy Hysope that groweth out of the wall, yea, euery one that bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewen down and cast into the fire: it is a righteous thing with God, to render vengeance to those that disobey him, and to destroy such as haue forsaken the law by euerlasting perditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
                  <p>Behold,<note place="margin">Reue. 1.7.</note> the Lorde shall come in the great and latter day of iudgement, when none shall escape his iudgement seate,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5.</note> with clowds shall hee come, and euery eye shall see him, euen they which pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him thorow, shall also wayle before him, being summoned all to appeare moste fearefullye before his imperiall
<pb facs="tcp:14113:20"/>
throne of Maiestie: then be fauorable O Lord, be fauourable. Alas, with whateies shall we miserable sinners behold him, so gloriouslie sitting in his royall kingdom, with all his mighty and holy Angels, and whole number of Saints,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 3.</note> sounding with the voice of the archangell, &amp; trumpet of God: causing the heauens to passe away with a noyse, and the elements to melt like waxe, and the earth to burne with the woorkes thereof? yea, with what eyes shall wee behold him, when we see the Sunne darkened, the Moone eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and the starres fall downe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen? But alas when he taketh the furbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed blade into his hand, when he is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to throwe the fierie thunderbolts of his wrath, when hee summoneth before him the worme that neuer dyeth, the fire that neuer shall be quenched, to reuenge on the wicked: into what a plight are they then driuen? then leaue they off; be fauourable O Lord, be fauourable, and say to the hilles: O ye mountaines, come and couer vs, O ye waters, come &amp; ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelme vs: wo, wo, wo, how great is this
<pb facs="tcp:14113:20"/>
darknesse? The godly on the other side, are bathed in such streames of blisse, and aduaunced to such happines, as neither tongue can vtter, nor heart conceiue.</p>
                  <p>The second thing wee haue to note in his promises, is his mercie, which excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all his workes. For God, though he haue giuen a cursse of the lawe against sinners, yet seeing Christ for the penitent hath borne the cursse, wherby his iustice is not impaired: he is content to accept our weakenes as our strength, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence our imperfections with reward of greatest perfection, &amp; that which we can performe but in small part, he is content to accept as whole: not for any desert of ours, but in the satisfaction of his sonne, who paid with the seale of his own blod, the ransome for our sins, he hath cancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the hand writing that was against vs. Wherfore we are to pray vnto God, that whensoeuer our sins shal come in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before him: that he would looke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ Iesus, the true loking glas, in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he shall find vs most pure &amp; innocent, &amp; to shine most cleerly in the righteousnes
<pb facs="tcp:14113:21"/>
which hee hath giuen vs by faith: so that we appeare not in our owne righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, but in the righteousnes of the lambe, who hauing taken away the sinnes of the world, and hauing made vs as white as snow, though wee were as red as Crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: saith, he will be mercifull to our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, and wil remember our sinnes no more. Of him doe all the Prophets beare witnesse, that thorow his name, all that beleeue, shall receiue remission of theyr sinnes. Againe drinke yee all of this, for this is my bloud, which is shed for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes. Christ gaue himselfe for our sinnes, that hee might deliuer vs from the cursse of the law, euen accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the will of his father. Christ bare our sinnes in his owne bodie on the tree, that we being deliuered from sin, might liue in righteousnes: by whose stripes we are healed, for we were as sheepe going astray, but are now returned to the shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard and Bishop of our soules. It is no more but beleeue, and be saued; beleeue and receiue remission; beleeue, and lay of thine owne righteousnes, and inuest
<pb facs="tcp:14113:21"/>
thy selfe with the righteousnesse of the vnspotted Lambe.</p>
                  <p>Dauid was young, and after was old: yet in all his daies he neuer saw the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous forsaken. Sometimes he scourgeth his children; but like a louing father: hee layeth no more vpon them then they are able to beare; for hee afflicteth them for his own iustice, because they are sinners; for his wisedome, to exercise their faith; for his mercie, to cause them to repent: but this is the end of all, he helpeth them in their distresses, he reuengeth himselfe vpon his enemies, and giueth to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple rest and quietnes. O that we would therefore praise the Lord, and forget not all other his singular benefits: O that we would confesse, that his mercie endureth for euer.</p>
                  <p>The third thing to note in his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, is his bountifull kindnesse, in requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring so small a thing, with so great and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall blessings: and bindeth himselfe by obligation (as it were) that as sure as we perfome the one, so hee will not faile to accomplish the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:14113:22"/>The fourth, is his patience and long suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, which is not slacknesse, as some men account slacknesse: but is patience, because willinglie hee would haue no man to perish, but gladly would haue all men come to repentance. He is content to stay our leysure, till we seeke and pray vnto him: and neuer smiteth, till there be no hope of redresse.</p>
                  <p>The fist, is his loue, in that he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to stirre vs vp to holy exercises, and puritie of life, and to allure vs with faire promises of aide, &amp; prosperous encrease of all his blessings in this world. The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular examination of these blessings, would require a large discourse, then (fearing tediousnes) I dare presume to trouble yee withall: wherefore a worde of ech, and so I end.</p>
                  <p>Touching the first, where it is said, <hi>God will awake vp vnto thee,</hi> it is a greater bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit then the words import: for it signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not onely that he will heare thee; but that he will also doo what thou desirest, and satisfie thy request. As long as the sinner sleepeth, the Lord is said to bee a
<pb facs="tcp:14113:22"/>
sleepe: but assoone as the sinner awaketh from sinne,<note place="margin">Psal. 78.</note> God will arise (sayth Dauid) and his enemies shall bee scattered: and they that hate him, shall flie before him, as the smoake vanisheth before the wind, and as the wax melteth against the fire, euen so shall the wicked perish at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God. Wherfore, as Paul exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Ephesians, so I exhort you: <hi>Awake thou that sleepest, stand vp from the dead,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ephe. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp; Christ shal giue thee light</hi>: awake vnto God and God will awake vnto thee, &amp; Christ euen the sonne of God, the bright mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning star, shall giue thee the light of life.</p>
                  <p>In the second, he promiseth abundance of worldly blessings, in recompence of prayer, for it is said: <hi>He will make the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of thy righteousnes prosperous:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Reue. 22.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
                     </note> that is,<note place="margin">Psal. 112.</note> the Lord will make peace within thy walles, and prosperitie within thy pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces:<note place="margin">Deu. 28.</note> hee will commaund his blessings to bee with thee in thy store house, and in all thou settest thy hand vnto: he will open vnto thee his good treasures, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the Heauens to giue raine on thy lande in due season. Thou shalt laye vp
<pb facs="tcp:14113:23"/>
golde,<note place="margin">Iob. 22.</note> as the dust, and the gold of Ophir, as the flint of the riuer:<note place="margin">Iob. 29.</note> thou shalt wash thy pathes with butter, and thy rockes shall powre out riuers of Oyle: thou shalt call saluation thy wall, and praise shall be in thy gates.<note place="margin">Psal. 128.</note> Loe, thus shall the man be blessed that feareth God.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, for <hi>being pure and vpright</hi>: hee will make thy latter end greatly encrease, and that thou maist the lesse mistrust his promise, hee will doe it, though thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning be but small.</p>
                  <p>Heere (brethren) ye see what a sea of matter is offered mee, wherevnto if I would commit my selfe, I might dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course vnto yee, what straunge euents (by Gods prouidence) haue happened in the world, what great Kings and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates haue been plucked downe from their thrones, and what contemptible persons in the eye of the world, haue beene aduanced to their roomes. How Mardocheus a straunger was exalted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hamons place:<note place="margin">Hest. 8.</note> how Ioseph and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niell,<note place="margin">Gen. 30.</note> the one a bond-man in Egipt, the other a Captiue in Babilon,<note place="margin">Dan. 6.</note> were made
<pb facs="tcp:14113:23"/>
Princes in those kingdomes. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I will not ouermuch transgresse the bondes of modestie, or hold ye long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then in this place I haue beene accust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omed: onely remember what the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet saith; <hi>Hee raiseth the needy out of the dust, and lifteth the poore out of the mire,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 113.</note> 
                     <hi>that he might set him with the Princes, euen with the princes of the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Remember the example of Dauid, whome the Lord chose, and tooke from the Ewes great with young: that hee might feede his people in Iaacob,<note place="margin">Psal. 78.</note> and his inheritance in Israell. Remember the example of Iob,<note place="margin">Iob. 42.</note> how the Lord turned the captiuitie of Iob, as the riuers in the south, how he blessed the last dayes of Iob more then the first, how he gaue him sheepe, and Camels, and Oxen,<note place="margin">Psal. 126.</note> and shee Asses in more aboundance then hee had before;<note place="margin">Psal. 42.</note> howe hee encreased him with sonnes and daughters, euen to the fourth generation, so that hee dyed being olde and full of dayes. Remember euen our owne estate, for whome the Lorde hath doone great things already: as created
<pb facs="tcp:14113:24"/>
vs, and redeemed vs, and sanctified vs, and not long since delyuered vs from the gaplng iawes of those that sought to suck our bloud. Vppon some hee hath bestowed humilitye, whereby their mindes are adorned with vertue: honor vppon others, whereby their persons are inuested with maiestie: vppon others comlinesse, whereby the other two are graced: vppon others Orchards which they planted not, or at least to which they gaue no encrease: vppon others, encrease of vertuous children, whereby their posteritie is preserued: vppon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the free passage of his word, which along time had beene obscured by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce, the mother of deuotion, as the shauelings call it, but vnder a stepdame of destruction as wee perceiue it: and though hee bestowe but some one or two of his blessings vppon vs, yet howe much are wee bounde for these bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,<note place="margin">Reue. 9.</note> to sing prayse, and honour, and glorye, vnto him that sitteth vppon the throne, and vnto the Lambe for euer. But vppon whome hee hath bestowed
<pb facs="tcp:14113:24"/>
all these blessings: O howe strictlye by good cause are they bounde to magnifie the Lord, and to reioyce in God theyr Sauiour. Examine then your owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, I beseech yee, whether GOD hath bestowed all these blessings vppon you, or no, and if he haue: O what great cause haue yee to come before his face with prayse,<note place="margin">Psal. 95. Psal. 96</note> to sing lowd vnto him with Psalmes, to worship and to fall downe before him, to giue vnto the Lorde the glorie of his name, to bring an offering of thankes giuing, and to enter into his Courts with praise. And yet who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, whether the Lord hath greater bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings for ye in store, yee may be sure hee will pull downe the mightie from their seat, and exalt the humble and meeke, Surely, the Lorde dooth vse vertue as a meane to bring vs to honour, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer you shall see endued with the vertues of this text, I meane, with seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto God, with prayer and puritie of life: yee may bee sure there is a blessing reserued for him of the Lorde, yea, such a blessing, as though his beginning
<pb facs="tcp:14113:25"/>
be but small, yet his latter end shall great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie encrease.</p>
                  <p>God encrease the loue of these things in our hearts, and make vs worthie of Christs blessings, which hee hath plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in store for vs: that after hee hath heaped temporall blessings vpon vs, hee would giue vs the blessing of all blessing, euen the lyfe of the world to come.</p>
                  <p>The time is spent, &amp;c. let vs end with prayer, &amp;c.</p>

As he was God hee was receiued of Mary: as hee was man hee was receiued of Martha. They both desired to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine our Sauiour as Iacob and Esau desired to please their aged father,<note place="margin">Gen. 27.</note> but Mary made choise of the better part, and was preferred before hir sist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as Iacob sped soonest of most dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

And although the care of Martha in the entertaining of Christ be not to be misliked; yet Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries diligence in hearing his doctrine is of purpose preferred, to teach vs, that it is much better with Marie to studie in the worde,<note place="margin">Math. 6, 33</note> and first to seeke the kingdom of God, then with Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha to labour in the worlde, and to neglect that heauenly kingdom. And yet notwithstanding, such is the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of this rustie age, that our greatest care is to prouide for this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent life, as the rich man, Luk. 12. that enlarged his barnes wherein to put his store for many yeares: but we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer or very late remember to prouide for the life to come, like that other rich man, Luk. 16. that neuer thought of heauen, till hee was tormented in the flames of hell.</p>
                  <p>In the 11. of Iohn, Christ is said to loue his whole familie; and heere he is said to come vnto them. For whom
<pb facs="tcp:14113:28"/>

Like Iacob that came downe into Egipt, to his beloued sonne Ioseph, and dwelt in Goshen. But Christ is yet more kinde then Iacob was,<note place="margin">Gen. 45.</note> for hee came not till he was sent for with horses and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots, but Christ came of his owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord to this beloued familie. Thus dooth he alwayes preuent vs with his blessings: before hee was desired hee came into the world, hee called his Apostles before they came to him, and before he was requested he came vnto this noble house. O happy house that enterteyned such a guest, but thrise happie inhabitants to whome such a guest woulde vouchsafe to come! When hee came vnto the swi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Gadarenes, they desired him to

Now as this vertue of hospitalitie is commendable in all sorts of men: so is it more specially commended to the ministers, who are expressely commanded by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle among other things,<note place="margin">1.

                  <p>When Martha had thus entertey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Christ as hee was man into hir house, Marie began to enterteine him

Thus dooth he alwayes shew himselfe a thankfull guest, into what house so euer hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth, he leaueth better things behind him then he findeth, hee loues not to be in Zacheus debt for his dinner,<note place="margin">Luke. 19.</note> for insteed thereof he bringeth saluation to his house, neither dooth hee leaue his supper vnpaide for heere, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steed thereof hee bestoweth vppon them a heauenly sermon.

some godly conference, to minister grace vnto the hearers, Ephe. 4, 29.</p>
                  <p>These sisters were godly women, and both earnest fauourers of Iesus Christ, and yet in the manner of their deuotion there is such difference, that the worldly affection of the one may in some sort be misliked, in respect of the godly exercise and practise of the other: Martha is sore encumbred with much seruing, where a little ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice had beene sufficient: But Marie is attentiue to heare the worde of God which neuer can be heard suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Matth. 5.</note>Marie sitteth to heare the word, as Christ vsed to sitte when he preached the word,<note place="margin">Luke. 4.</note> to shew that the word is to bee preached and heard with a quiet minde.<note place="margin">Iohn. 8.</note> In a still night euery voyce is heard, and when the body is quiet, the minde most commonly is quiet also.

                  <p>When our mindes are quiet,<note place="margin">Luke. 3.</note> we are fitte to deale with heauenly matters,

                  <p>Marie sat at Iesus feete, yet sat shee not sleeping as many sit at the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers feete, but shee sate at Christ his feete and heard his worde. As Paul was brought vp at the feete of Gama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leell,<note place="margin">Acts. 22.</note> and was perfectly instructed in the law of the Fathers.</p>
                  <p>Hir humilitie is commended, in that she sat at Iesus feete, to shew that the word is to bee heard with all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie: hir diligence and earnestnes appeareth, in that shee would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to helpe hir sister, to signifie that the hearing of the word must be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before worldly businesse.</p>

                     <pb facs="tcp:14113:31"/>Hir diligence and humilitie, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to condemne our negligence, and contempt of Christ and his word: we doo not sit at Christ his feete, nay we rather set Christ at our feet, when wee are so negligent in hearing of his worde.</p>
                  <p>Wee are as slowe to come to the Church,<note place="margin">Gen. 8.</note> as the Rauen was to come to the Arke, and as loth to spend any time in the seruice of God,<note place="margin">Exod. 8.32.</note> as Pharao was loth to let the Israelites goe to serue the Lord. If a commoditie were to bee seene whereout some profit might arise, how carefull would wee be to procure it? what paines would wee take to get it? Absalon was not more desirous of a kingdome,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 15.</note> then the rich men of our time are desirous of golden gaine. But if it bee a matter of coste or trouble, if they cannot heare the worde preached without some hinderance to their worldlye businesse, and some extraordinarie charge to their pursse, then like the
<pb facs="tcp:14113:32"/>
Gadarenes,<note place="margin">Luke. 8. Matt. 13.45</note> they are content to take their leaue of Christ and his worde, and had rather loose that heauenly Pearle, then they would parte from their earthly pelfe.</p>
                  <p>Thus in Christ wee haue the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of a good Pastor, and in Marie the patterne of a good hearer: Let Ministers learne by his example, to take all occasions to preach the word,<note place="margin">2.

                  <p>While Marie was carefull for the foode of the soule, Martha was curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to prouide foode for the bodie, hir greatest care was to enterteyne Christ and to make him good cheere, to testifie hir thankfull minde vnto him that had doone so great things for them, hee had raysed hir brother Lazarus from death to life, therefore

                  <p>It was not vnlawfull for Martha to labour, no more then it was vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

for Peter to sleepe, but when Christ was preaching, it was no time for hir to bee so busie in seruing, no more then it was time for Peter to sleepe when Christ willed him so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly to watch and praye.<note place="margin">Matth. 26.</note> When Christ preached out of Symons ship to the people that stoode vppon the shore,<note place="margin">Luke. 5.</note> it was no time for Peter to play the Fisherman. But when Christ had left speaking and commanded him to launch into the deepe, then it was time for Peter to let downe the net. There is a time wherein we ought to labour in our vocation, and a time wherein we ought to heare the word, and as we may not vtterly neglect our lawfull callings, to followe sermons, so must wee not bestow the Sabaoth which is consecrated to the seruice of God, in following the workes of our vocation.<note place="margin">Eccle. 3.</note> All things haue their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time (saith the wise man) Eccle. 3. and euery thing is seemely in his conuenient season; but when

                  <p>Although Martha did not heare Christ, yet did she labour for Christ: many in our dayes will neyther la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for Christ, nor heare of Christ, but as the Israelites were wearye of their iourney in the wildernesse,<note place="margin">Num. 21.</note> and lothed that heauenly Manna, so these men are wearie of euery godly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, and are soone cloyed with the word of God.<note place="margin">Matth. 25.</note> The fiue foolish Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins wasted their Oyle to no purpose, and while they went to buie, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the marriage, and these foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish men spende this time of grace vainely and wantonly, as though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this life there were no time of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and vengeance to be feared. The daye serueth for their pride or profit, the night is spent in sporte and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and no time is left to heare the worde. When wee are praying they are playing; when we are preaching
<pb facs="tcp:14113:34"/>
they are eating and drinking, like the old world,<note place="margin">Gen. 6.

                  <p>Nowe Martha findeth hir selfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeued, and begins to enuie hir sist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers exercise,<note place="margin">Gen. 37.</note> as Iosephs brethren en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyed him for his dreames, and the sonnes of Ishai that disdained theyr brother Dauid for his forwardnesse in the combat with Goliath.<note place="margin">1.

                  </p>
                  <p>These two sisters, that in other things agreed so well togither, in this doo differ so much, that Christ must haue the hearing of the matter, and decide the controuersie; Martha plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Plaintife and accuseth hir sist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; Marye the defendant, answereth by hir Aduocate, and Christ himselfe
<pb facs="tcp:14113:34"/>
that tooke vppon him the office of an Aduocate, is become the Iudge, and giueth sentence on Maryes side; Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha complaineth of hir sisters sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, and seemeth after a sorte to blame our Sauiour for winking at it, requiring him to see the matter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed speedily. But Christ first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooueth Marthaes curiositie, and then excuseth, yea and commendeth Maries care. In Martha it appeareth howe willing wee are to please our selues in our owne conceits, and how ready to conceiue amisse of others dooings, yea sometime to prefer our owne defects, before the perfections of other men. If Dauid chasten his soule with fasting,<note place="margin">Psal. 69.</note> it shall bee turned to his reproofe; if hee put on Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth to testifie his contrition, they iest at him, and the drunkards make songs of him:<note place="margin">Luke. 7.33.</note> if Iohn Baptist be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate in his apparrell and dyet, they will say hee hath a diuell.<note place="margin">Acts. 25</note> If Paul an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere discreetely for himselfe, he shall

Among vs, if there be any that be more forward in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then the rest, and more diligent to heare the worde, as Marie was, there shall not want some or other to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure them at their pleasure, yea to finde faulte and to condemne them for so doing: yet are not the godly to bee discouraged herewith, or to desist from theyr godly exercises: for as the Lorde answered for Mary when shee held hir peace; so the Lorde will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their cause, and take their part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their aduersaries. The Lorde cannot abide to heare his seruants ill spoken off, but is alwayes ready to mainteine their right, and to answere for them.<note place="margin">Gen. 31.24.</note> He will not suffer Laban to speake an ill worde to his seruant Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob.
<pb facs="tcp:14113:35"/>
And if Aaron and Myriam mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure against Moises,<note place="margin">Num. 12.</note> the Lorde will punish it with leprosie, what a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable thing is this to the godly, that the king of kings will take their parts, and will not suffer them to susteyne any wrong. Hee is a most sure and trustie friend, that will not abide his friend to bee backbited or ill spoken of, but eyther hee will answere in their defence, or hee will finde some meanes to stop the mouthes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine the slanderous toungs of their enemies, as somtime he stopt Balaams passage,<note place="margin">Num. 22</note> when hee went to curse his people, and caused the dumbe beast to speake, and to reprooue the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Prophet, rather then he woulde haue his people to bee curs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.<note place="margin">2.

                  <p>The repitition of Marthaes name, argueth the vehemencie and earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of this admonition. The Lord is faine to be very earnest and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate with vs, before hee can reclaime

vs.<note place="margin">Gen. 22</note> So when God spake vnto Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, hee calleth him twise by name; Christ called Peter thrise by name, Iohn. 21. to cause him make his three-fould confession, to make amends for his threefold deniall. And when the Lorde spake vnto Samuel,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 3.</note> hee called him foure seuerall times by name before hee answered; for such is the great mercie of GOD, that he is content to admonish vs often of our dutie, and such is the dulnesse and peruersenesse of our crooked na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that wee cannot bee gayned by the first admonition: but the Lord must call vs often and earnestly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we will harken vnto him.</p>
                  <p>There are two things in this speach of Christ to be obserued. The first is his modest reprehension, of Marthaes immoderate care: the other is, his friendly defence of Maries choise.</p>
                  <p>Though Martha was very carefull to entertaine Christ in the best man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, yet if he perceiue any thing in hir
<pb facs="tcp:14113:36"/>
worthie of reprehension, he will not stick to tell hir of it: he will not sooth hir in hir saying, nor smooth hir in hir owne conceit, for all the trouble and cost that she bestowes vpon him. If we be often inuited to some mans table, and kindely enterteyned, it would bee vnkindlye taken, if wee should finde fault with any disorder, but forasmuch as all Christ his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are the instructions of Christians, therefore euery Christian, but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Preachers, whome it more speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally concerneth, must learne by this example how to behaue themselues, when they are inuited to great feasts: namely to speake their conscience freely when they see a fault. The best requitall that wee can make for our good cheere, is to giue good counsell and wholsome admonition to them that inuite vs. When Christ dined with the Pharisey, Luke. 11. and was misliked for not washing before din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, hee tooke occasion to reprooue
<pb facs="tcp:14113:37"/>
their hypocrisie, their outward show of holinesse, which was the sinne of the Pharises: and at another time he noteth them, for preasing to the chiefe places at banquets,<note place="margin">Luke. 14.</note> and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what modestie is to bee obserued in sitting downe to meate, and what guests should be bidden to our table. So should Preachers behaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues towards those that inuite them to great feasts, where they see perhaps some fault or disorder, either in the Maister of the house, or in some other of the guests; to saye vnto them thus or otherwise, as the case requireth: I will warne you of one thing that will doo you good, that you would leaue your vsurie and extortion, your coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse and oppression, that you would leaue your swearing and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming the name of God, that you would forbeare to prophane the Lords Sabaoth, that you would leaue your pride and excesse in your dyet and apparrell: that you would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
<pb facs="tcp:14113:37"/>

These are the faults which are easie to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spyed almost in euery place, and these are the faultes which the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full minister of Christ Iesus should not leaue vnreprooued wheresoeuer he commeth,<note place="margin">

                  <p>If Christ had cause to finde faulte with Martha for hir too much dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in his enterteinement, it seemes hee was not curious of his dyet, but would haue beene content with sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple cates: he was no delicate or dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie guest, hee did not affect or delight in sumptuous banquets, or costly fare,
<pb facs="tcp:14113:38"/>
he rather requireth a religious heart, a constant faith, a willing mind to heare the word,<note place="margin">Luke. 11.28.</note> with an earnest care to liue thereafter. These are the things wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Lorde delighteth, these are the iuncates which hee desireth, and which he preferreth before all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cheere. Thus is Martha reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for hir curiositie: now let vs see how Marie is excused and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for hir godly care. One thing is necessary (saith Christ) and what is that one thing? euen to heare the word preached,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.16.</note> which is the power of God to saluation, to euery one that beleeueth. A man may better want all things then that one needful thing, and yet we desire all other things, and neglect that one thing which is so needfull. This one thing hath Marie chosen; and therefore hath chosen the better part. Marthaes part is good bicause it prouideth for this present life: but Maries part is better, bicause it leadeth to eternall life. It is good
<pb facs="tcp:14113:38"/>
to be occupyed about our calling, to get our liuing: but it is better to bee occupied in hearing the word, which is able to saue our soules. As the head and the foot are both needfull in the body, so Marie and Martha are both needfull in a commonwealth: man hath two vocations, the one earthlye by his labour, the other heauenly by his prayer. There is the actiue life, which consisteth in practising the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres of this life, wherein man shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himselfe to bee like himselfe, and there is the contemplatiue life, which consisteth in the meditation of diuine and heauenly things, wherein man sheweth himselfe to bee like the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: for they which labour in their temporall vocations, do liue like men; but they which labour in spirituall matters, liue like Angels: When they heare the word; God speaketh vnto them: when they pray, they speake vnto God; so that there is a continual conference betweene God and them,
<pb facs="tcp:14113:39"/>
bicause they are continually exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in hearing or praying.</p>
                  <p>Christ loued Martha for hir hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitalitie, as Isaac loued Esau for his Venison.
