            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THat although we abhorre nothing more, then the deſigning of any thing to the
danger and prejudice of this Common-wealth of <hi>England,</hi> and utterly deteſt all
ſuch plots and confederacies, as were entred into by <hi>Euſebius Andrews,</hi> lately ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged,
by the <hi>High Court of Juſtice,</hi> to dye as a Traytor for the ſame, yet deeply
weighing, that of all the Fundamental Liberties of <hi>England,</hi> none were ever either by people
or Parliaments, eſteemed ſo precious, as Tryals by Juryes, conſiſting of indifferent uningaged
ſworn men, although for facts of higheſt Treaſon, againſt the very ſafety and being of the
Common-wealth; whereby the publick peace hath been ſaved, and juſtice done upon the
greateſt Traytors. And that for preſervation of the ſaid juſt way of Tryals, the 29. <hi>Chap.</hi> of
<hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and <hi>the Petition of Right,</hi> were principally conſtituted, and have been ever by
our Anceſtors exceedingly contended for; and for which chiefly, the Parliament undertook
their War againſt the late King, as without which <hi>Magna Charta</hi> and <hi>the Petition of Right,</hi>
were both dead and uſeleſs to the people.</p>
            <p>And being well aſſured that the principal cauſe of aboliſhing the <hi>High Commiſſion, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel-Table</hi>
and <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> (in all which they never attempted life) was, for that they were
contrary to the 29. <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> and <hi>the Petition of Right,</hi> in proceeding without
Juries, And being very ſenſible of the manifeſt danger of Tryals by another way (without any
reſpect to the perſon of the ſaid <hi>Andrews</hi> otherwiſe then as bound in duty and Conſcience,
to preſerve this our Fundamental Liberty, indeed our ſole Liberty, and without which, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
is but an empty name) Grieving at our very ſouls, to have ſeen the ſame violated more
then ONCE in this kind, which (after your Declarations of <hi>Febr.</hi> and <hi>March</hi> 1648. to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
inviolable that moſt excellent Law (as you call it) of <hi>the Petition</hi> of <hi>Right,</hi> with all things
incident and belonging to the Lives, Liberties and properties of the people of <hi>England</hi>) We
hoped would have been the laſt.</p>
            <p>We therefore moſt earneſtly intreat, that you will be pleaſed to ſuſpend execution of the
ſaid <hi>Euſebius Andrews,</hi> and to admit unto him and to all other offenders whatſoever, the
benefit of Legal Tryals by Juryes in an ordinary way, and that the High Court of Juſtice
may for ever ceaſe; that ſo this our Fundamenoal Liberty (abundantly more prized by us
then our Lives, and all our Relations) may ſtand firm and inviolable to all future Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations;
and our ſelves and all other Lovers of the ancient good Laws and Liberties of
<hi>England,</hi> may be truly encouraged, heartily and chearfully to ſerve and aſſiſt you
againſt the Common enemy; which we humbly preſume, your Honours will find of more
ſafety to your ſelves and the Authority of this Nation, then the continuance of an High
Court of Juſtice.</p>
