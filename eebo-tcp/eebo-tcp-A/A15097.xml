            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Courteous Reader:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT will appeare to any man of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense at first sight, that this rude draught, that sets forth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine considerable grounds in planting Colonies, being wrested out of the Authours hand, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly overlooked, much lesse field and smoothed for the Presse, was never intended to be presented to publicke view, especially in this attire: wherefore the Reader is intreated to observe, that the particulars of this small Pamphlet, being all ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged under these two heads, matters of Fact or of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: In the former the Authour sets downe his knowledge, and consequently what he resolves to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie; In the latter what he conceives to be most probable, not what he dares warrant as certaine and infallible. Wherefore if in the declaring of his owne opinion, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concerning Colonies in general, or this in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, he propose anything that to men of better and more solid judgement upon mature advise shall seeme either not sound, or not evident, or not well fortified by strength of reason; he desires rather advertisement thereof by some private intimation, than by publicke opposition, as not conceiving an argument of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,


<pb facs="tcp:12004:3"/>
wherein neither Gods glorie nor mans salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on have any necessary interest, (though the worke be directed to, and doth in a good measure further both,) worth the contending for in a time when so many weighty controversies in the fundamentalls of religion are in agitation: and withall professing himselfe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to receive backe any light golde that hath passed from him unweighed, and to exchange it for that which will be weight, as being conscious to himselfe, that he desires not willingly to beguile any man. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, the Reader may be pleased further to observe, that seeing the arguments produced in this Treatise are rather proposed than handled, they cannot carry with them that appearant and cleare evidence of truth at the first view, as they might and would doe, if they were more largely deduced, and more fully fortified. Wherefore he is intreated not to reject them too easily, as carrying more weight than they seeme to doe at the first appearance. Howsoever the Authors intention and opinion be construed &amp; approved; if it may be beleeved that the Gentlemen that are lately issued out from us, to lay the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a Colony in New-England, haue not beene thrust forward by unadvised precipitation, but led on by such probable grounds of reason and religion, as might be likely to prevaile with men that desire to keepe a good conscience in all things: I trust these will holde themselves reasonably satisfied; howsoever both they, and such as wish the furtherance of your designe, have (I assure my selfe) a testimonie from God and your owne consciences, that they have endeavoured to take there footing upon warrantable grounds, and to direct themselves to a right scope, as will be further manifested in this ensuing Treatise.</p>

               <p>COLONIES (as other conditions <note place="margin">1. That Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies have their warrant from God.</note> and states in humane society) have their warrant from Gods direction and command; who <note place="margin">1.

Those words, I grant, expresse a promise, as the title of a benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction prefixed unto them here, &amp; in the repetition of them to <hi>Noah,</hi> implies. <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 1. But that withal they include a direction or command was never, as I conceive, doubted by any. <hi>Iunius</hi> upon them:


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:12004:4"/>
                  <hi>Prout vim intus indiderat, sic palam mandatum dedit eurandae propagationis &amp; dominationis exercendae.</hi> And <hi>Paraeus, Iubet igitur replere terram, non solum generatione &amp; habitatione, sed cum primis potestate eultu &amp; usu: Etsi vero nonnullae orbis partes manent inhabitabiles; habemus nihilominus totius dominium iure Divino, lic et non habeamus totius orbis usum cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pâ &amp; defectu nostro.</hi> And before them, <hi>Calvin; Iubet eos crescere &amp; simul benedictionem suam destinat, &amp;c.</hi> and divers other's.</p>
               <p>It will be granted then that the words include and have the force of a Precept, which perhaps some may conceive was to continue during the worlds Infancy, and no longer; but such a limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wants ground. It is true that some comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements founded upon, and having respect unto some present state and condition of men, received end or alteration when the condition was ended, or changed. But Precepts given to the body of mankind, as these to <hi>Adam &amp; Noah,</hi> receive neither alteration in the substantials, nor determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on while men, and any void places of the earth continue, so that allowing this Commandement to bind <hi>Adam,</hi> it must binde his posterity, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently our selves in this age, and our issue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter us, as long as the earth yeelds empty places to be replenished.</p>
               <p>Besides, the gift of the earth to the sonnes of <note place="margin">2. Argument from Gods gift of the earth to men.</note> men, <hi>Psal.</hi> 115. 16. necessarily inforceth their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to people it: It were a great wrong to God to conceive that hee doth ought in vaine, or ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:12004:4"/>
a gift that he never meant should be enjoyed: now how men should make benefit of the earth, but by habitation and culture cannot bee ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined.</p>
               <p>Neither is this sufficient to conceive that Gods intention is satisfied if some part of the earth be replenished, and used, though the rest be wast; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the same difficulty urgeth us still, that the rest of which we receive no fruit, was never inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to us, because it was never Gods minde wee should possesse it. If it were then the minde of God, that man should possesse all parts of the earth, it must be enforced that we neglect our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and crosse his will, if we doe it not, when wee have occasion and opportunitie: and withall doe little lesse then despise his blessing.</p>
               <p>Withall, that order that God annexed to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage <note place="margin">3. Argument from the Law of marriage.</note> in his first institution, <hi>viz.</hi> that married per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons should leave father and mother, and cleave each to other, is a good warrant of this practice. For sometime there will be a necessitie, that yong married persons should remove out of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers house, and live apart by themselves, and so erect new families. Now what are new families, but pettie Colonies: and so at last removing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and further they overflow the whole earth. Therefore, so long as there shall be use of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, the warrant of deducing Colonies will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue. <note place="margin">4. Argument from the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit that comes to mens out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward estates.</note>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, that all Gods directions have a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble scope, mans good, and Gods honour. Now


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:12004:5"/>
that this commandement of God is directed vnto mans good temporall and spirituall, is as cleere as the light. It cannot be denyed but the life of man is every way made more comfortable, and afforded a more plentiful supply in a large scope of ground, which moves men to bee so insatiable in their desires to joyne house to house, and land to land, till there be no more place; exceeding, I grant, therein the measure and bounds of Iustice; and yet building upon a principle that nature sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gests, that a <hi>large place best assures sufficiency:</hi> as we see; by nature, trees flourish faire, and pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per well, and waxe fruitfull in a large Orchard, which would otherwise wither and decay, if they were penned up in a little nursery: either all, or at best, a few that are stronger plants and better rooted, would encrease and over-top, and at last, starve the weaker: which falls out in our civill State; where a few men flourish that are best grounded in their estates, or best furnished with abilities, or best fitted with opportunities, and the rest waxe weake and languish, as wanting roome and meanes to nourish them.</p>
               <p>Now, that the spirits and hearts of men are kept in better temper by spreading wide, and by <note place="margin">5. Argument is from the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse and honesty.</note> pouring, as it were, from vessell to vessell (the want whereof is alleaged by the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> as the cause that <hi>Moab</hi> setled vpon his lees, and got so harsh a relish <hi>Ier.</hi> 48. 11.) will bee euident to any man, that shall consider, that the husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of unmanured grounds, and shifting into


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:12004:5"/>
empty Lands, enforceth men to frugalitie, and quickneth invention: and the setling of new States requireth justice and affection to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good: and the taking in of large Countreys presents a naturall remedy against couetousnesse, fraud, and violence; when euery man may enjoy enough without wrong or injury to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Whence it was, that the first ages, by these helpes, were renowned for golden times, wherein men, being newly entred into their possessions, and entertained into a naked soile, and enforced thereby to labour, frugality, simplicity, and justice, had neither leisure, nor occasion, to decline to idlenesse, riot, wantonnesse, fraud, and violence, the fruits of well-peopled Countryes, and of the abundance and superfluities of long setled States.</p>
               <p>But that which should most sway our hearts, <note place="margin">6. Argument from the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement of Gods glory.</note> is the respect unto Gods honor, which is much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced by this worke of replenishing the earth. First, when the largeness of his bounty is tasted by setling of men in al parts of the world, wherby the extent of his munificence to the sonnes of men is discovered; The Psalmist tells us that God is much magnified by this, <hi>that the whole earth is full of his riches, yea and the wide sea too, Psal.</hi> 104. 24. 25. And God, when hee would have <hi>Abraham</hi> know what he had bestowed on him when he gave him <hi>Canaan,</hi> wills him to walke through it in the length of it, and in the breadth of it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. 17.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Gods honour must needs bee much


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:12004:6"/>
advanced, when, together with mens persons, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is conveyed into the severall parts of the world, and all quarters of the earth sound with his praise; and Christ Iesus takes in the Nations for his inhenitance, and the ends of the earth for his possession, according to Gods decree and promise. <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. 8.</p>
               <p>Besides all that hath beene said, seeing Gods command, and abilities to performe it, usually <note place="margin">7. Argument from the abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties wherewith God furnisheth men for this worke.</note> goe together, we may guesse at his intention and will, to have the earth replenished, by the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie fruitfulnesse that hee gave to mankinde in those first times, when men manifested their greatest forwardnesse for the undertaking of this taske; which seemes to bee denyed to the latter ages, and peradventure for this reason among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, because the love of ease and pleasure fixing men to the places and Countreyes which they finde ready furnished to their hand, by their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors labours and industry, takes from them a desire and will of undertaking such a laborious and unpleasant taske as is the subduing of unma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nured Countreyes.</p>

                  <p>Its one thing to guesse what God will bring to passe, and another thing to conclude what hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires us to undertake. Shall we say that because God gives not men the zeale of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas,</hi> therefore hee hath discharged men of the duty of executing judgement. It is true indeed, that God hath hitherto suffered the neglect of many parts of the world, and hidden them from the eyes of former ages; for ends best knowne to himselfe: but that disproves not that the duty of peopling voyd places lyes upon us still, especially since they are discovered and made knowne to us. And, although I dare not enter so farre into Gods secrets, as to affirme, that hee avengeth the neglect of this duty by Warres, Pestilences and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines, which unlesse they had wasted the people of these parts of the world, wee should ere this, have devoured one another; Yet it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, but the neare thronging of people together in these full Countreyes, have often occasioned amongst us ciuill Warres, Famines, and Plagues. And it is as true that God hath made advantage of some of these Warres, especially which have laid many fruitfull Countreyes wast, to exercise men in these very labours which employ new Planters; by which he hath reduced them to some degrees of that frugality, industry, and justice,</p>

                  <p>But, seeing Gods honour, and glory; and next mens Salvation, is his owne principall scope in this and all his wayes; it must withall bee necessarily acknowledged that the desire &amp; respect unto the publishing of his name where it is not knowne, and reducing men, that live without God in this present world, unto a forme of Piety and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, by how much the more immediately it suites with the mind of God, and is furthest caried from private respects, by so much the more it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanceth this worke of planting Colonies above all civill and humane ends, and deserves honour, and approbation, above the most glorious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests, or successefull enterprizes that ever were undertaken by the most renowned men that the Sunne hath seene, and that by how much the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing of Satan is a more glorious act, then a victory over men: and the enlargement of Christs Kingdome, then the adding unto mens domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and the saving of mens soules, then the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision for their lives and bodies.</p>
                  <p>It seemes, this end, in plantation, hath beene specially reserved for this later end of the world:

               <p>Next, how serviceable this Country must needs bee for provisions for shipping, is sufficiently knowne already: At present it may yeeld Planks, Masts, Oares, Pitch, Tarre, and Iron; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after (by the aptnesse of the Soyle for Hempe) if the Colonie increase, Sailes and Cordage.

                  <p>The cold of Winter is tolerable, as experience hath, and doth manifest, and is remedied by the abundance of fuell. The Snow lyes indeed about a foot thicke for ten weekes or there about; but where it lies thicker, and a month longer, as in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> men finde a very comfortable dwelling. As for the Serpents, it is true, there are some, and these larger then our Adders; but in ten yeares experience no man was ever indangered by them; and as the countrey is better stored with people, they will be found fewer, and as rare as among us here. As for the wilde beasts, they are no more, nor so much dangerous or hurtfull here, as in germany and other parts of the world. The Muskitoes indeed infest the planters, about foure moneths in the heat of Summer; but after one yeares acquaintance, men make light account of them; some fleight defence for the hands and face, smoake, and a close house may keepe them off. Neither are they much more noysome then in <hi>Spaine, Germany,</hi> and other parts; nay, then the fennish parts of <hi>Essex,</hi> and <hi>Lincolne-shire.</hi> Besides it is credibly reported, that twenty miles inward into the Countrey they are not found: but this is certaine, and tried by experience, after foure or five yeares habitation they waxe very thinne: It may be the hollownesse of the ground</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. 5.</hi> What persons may be fit to be employed in this worke of planting a Colony.</head>
               <p>IT seemes to bee a common and grosse errour that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies ought to be Emunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories or sinckes of States; to drayne away their filth: whence arise often murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings at the removall of any men of State or worth, with some wonder and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that men of sufficiency and discretion should preferre any thing before a quiet life at home. An opinion that favours strongly of selfe-love, alwaies opposite and enemy to any publike good. This fundamentall errour hath beene the occasion of the miscariage of most of our Colonies, and the chargeable destruction of many of our Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whom when we have once issued out from


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:12004:16"/>
us we cast off as we say to the wide world, leaving them to themselves either to sinke or swimme.</p>
               <p>Contrary to this common custome, a State that intends to draw out a Colony for the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting of another Country, must looke at the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the daughter with an equall and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent eye; remembring that a Colony is a part and member of her owne body; and such in whose good her selfe hath a peculiar interest, which therfore she should labour to further and cherish by all fit and convenient meanes; and consequently must allow to her such a proportion of able men as may bee sufficient to make the frame of that new formed body: As good Governours, able Ministers, Physitians, Souldiers, Schoolemasters, Mariners, and Mechanicks of all sorts; who had therefore need to bee of the more sufficiency, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the first fashioning of a politicke body is a harder taske then the ordering of that which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready framed; as the first erecting of a house is ever more difficult then the future keeping of it in repaire; or as the breaking of a Colt requires more skill then the riding of a managed horse. When the frame of the body is thus formed and furnished with vitall parts, and knit together with firme bands &amp; sinewes, the bulke may be filled up with flesh, that is with persons of lesse use and activity, so they bee plyable and apt to bee kept in life.</p>
               <p>

                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:12004:16"/>
The disposition of these persons must bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected as much or more then their abilities; men nourished up in idlenesse, unconstant, and affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing novelties, unwilling, stubborne, enclined to faction, covetous, luxurious, prodigall, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally men habituated to any grosse evill, are no fit members of a Colony. Ill humours soone over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw a weake body; and false stones in a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ruine the whole building: the persons ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore chosen out for this employment, ought to be willing, constant, industrious, obedient, frugall, lovers of the common good, or at least such as may be easily wroght to this temper; considering that workes of this nature try the undertakers with many difficulties, and easily discourage minds of base and weake temper. It cannot, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, be hoped that all should be such; care must be had that the principalls be so inclined, and as many of the Vulgar as may bee, at least that they bee willing to submit to authority; mutinies, which many times are kindled by one person, are well nigh as dangerous in a Colony, as in an Armie.</p>
               <p>These are rules concerning electing of fit per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for Colonies in generall, unto which must be adjoyned the consideration of the principall scope whereat the Colonie aimes; which must be Religion, whether it bee directed to the good of others for their conversion; or of the Planters themselves for their preservation and continuance


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:12004:17"/>
in a good condition, in which they cannot long subsist without Religion. To this purpose must be allotted to every Colony, for Governours and Ministers especially, men of piety and blamelesse life, especially in such a Plantation as this in <hi>New-England,</hi> where their lives must be the patternes to the Heathen, and the especiall, effectuall meanes of winning them to the love of the truth. Nay it would beè indeavoured, that all Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours offamilies, either may be men truly Godly or at least such as consent and agree to a forme of morall honestie and sobrietie. As for other ends lesse principall, which are especially Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise &amp; defence, common sense teacheth eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man that the Colonie must be furnished with the greatest store of such persons as are most ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the maine end at which it aimes.</p>

               <p>TO give a cleare Resolution to this Proposition, is a matter of no small difficultie: I shall declare mine owne opinion, and leave it to the censure of the godly wise. It is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of some men, that no man may undertake this taske without an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry warrant, such as <hi>Abraham</hi> had from God, to call him out of <hi>Mesopotamia</hi> to <hi>Canaan;</hi> their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion seemes to rest upon a ground that will hardly be made good, <hi>sc.</hi> That the planting of Colonies is an extraordinarie worke. Which if it be granted, then the argument hath a strong, and for ought I know, a necessary inference: That therefore those that undertake it, must have an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Call. But that Proposition, That planting of Colonies is an extraordinary worke, will not easily be granted. This Argument lyes strongly against it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Duty that is commanded by a perpetuall Law, cannot be accounted extraordinary.</hi>


                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:12004:19"/>
                  <hi>But the sending out of Colonies is commanded by a perpetuall Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore it is no extraordinary duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that the commandement is perpetuall, hath beene proved. First, because it was given to mankind; and secondly, because it hath a ground which is perpetuall, <hi>sc.</hi> the emptinesse of the earth, which either is so, or may be so while the world endures; for even those places which are full, may be emptied by warres, or sicknesse; and then an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument presseth as strongly the contrary way. The undertaking of an ordinary duty needs no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then an ordinary warrant; but such is plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a Colony, as being undertaken by vertue of a perpetuall law; therefore the undertaking to plant a Colony, needs no extraordinary warrant. Indeed <hi>Abrahams</hi> undertaking was extraordinary in many things, and therefore needed an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate direction from God.</p>
               <p n="1">1, <hi>He was to goe alone with his family and brethren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2, <hi>To such a certaine place far distant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3, <hi>Possessed already by the</hi> Canaanites.</p>
               <p n="4">4, <hi>To receive it wholy appropriated to himselfe, and his Issue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5, <hi>Not to plant it at present, but onely sojourne in it, and walke through it for a time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now none of these circumstances fit our ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Colonies; and consequently <hi>Abrahams</hi> exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is nothing to this purpose, because the case is different, though in some other things alike.</p>
               <p>

                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:12004:19"/>
Others conceive, that though men may adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon the worke upon an ordinary warrant, yet none can give that but the State; therefore they require a command from the highest autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie unto such as ingage themselves in this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faire. Indeed that the State hath power over all her members, to command and dispose of them within the bounds of justice, is more evident, then can be denyed: but this power she executes diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly; sometime by command, sometimes by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission: as in preparations to warre, sometimes men are compelled to serve, sometimes they are permitted to goe voluntaries that will.</p>
               <p>Againe, somtimes the Supreme power takes care of the whole businesse; sometimes (as in Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters) commits it to delegates. If the power of State then proclaime liberty to such as will, to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and unite into the body of a Colony, and commit the care to some persons that offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, to associate to them whom they thinke fit, and to order them according to discretion; no man can deny but that the State hath given a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient warrant. Neither doth it appeare, that ever any State did more; The <hi>Romans</hi> use was to proclaime that they intended to plant a Colony of such a number in such a place, and as many as would give in their names should receive so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny acres of Ground, and enjoy such other privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges as they thought fit to grant them, which they then expressed: Those which gave in their names were inrolled till the number was full,


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:12004:20"/>
and then had they certaine Commissioners ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the State of see all things ordered and directed accordingly, and to put every man into possession of his inheritance; neither did the State interpose their authority in assigning, and choosing out the men, but left it free and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary to every man to take or leave.</p>
               <p>Seeing nothing can beare out the hazzards, and inconveniences of such toylesome and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult undertakings, as is the planting of Colonies, but a willing minde: Men can digest any thing that themselves choose or desire; but a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement makes pleasant things harsh, how much more harsh things intolerable?</p>
               <p>But to come somewhat nearer unto the grounds of this resolution. In undertaking an new inploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment two things must be taken into consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, upon which a mans warrant must be grounded.</p>
               <p n="1">1, His ingagement unto his present condition in which he is setled.</p>
               <p n="2">2, The tender and offer of the new service unto which he is called.</p>
               <p>In both it must be first granted, that Callings are employments in which we serve one another through love, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 13. in something that is good, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 28. not seeking our owne, but other mens profit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 24.</p>
               <p>In furthering other mens good our ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are,</p>
               <p n="1">1, To the Church in generall.</p>
               <p n="2">2, To that particular State of which wee are


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:12004:20"/>
members, either wholy, or any branch of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3, To our friends.</p>
               <p>And these as they have interest in our labours of love in that order that is set downe, so they have power to require them in the same order, and that two wayes, either by their expresse; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, or by the manifestation of their necessity, or speciall good proposed. The Church in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall rarely layes any command but mostly chalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth our service by the discovery of her need, and use of our labours for her good. The particular State, besides the pleading of her necessity; inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth her authority; and that either immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as in deputing men to publike offices; or medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately by our parents, or other governours whom she authorizeth to direct and setle us in such par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular callings and imployments as may bee for her use and service. The State then by any publike intimation, proclaming free liberty to men to remove and plant themselves else-where, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargeth these persons of the obligation wherein by her power and authority they stand bound to their particular calling wherein they are placed, and ought otherwise to continue. So that now particular persons stand no longer bound by the States authoritie, but by the manifestation of her necessities, which crave their ayde and service for their publike good and safety.</p>
               <p>The next thing then to bee taken into conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, is the advantages or benefits, which may be


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:12004:21"/>
gained by our service either to the Church, State, or friends to whom wee have relation by private interest. In all these the first respect must be had to necessity, and the next to conveniency. How much is to bee yeelded to necessity, it hath pleased God to manifest; by dispensing with his owne worship and service, in cases of necessity, not only upon our owne persons: but upon our goods or cattell. It must therefore be duly waighed whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we may be more serviceable to the Church in the State where wee live, or in that wee desire to erect: and againe, whether service is of more necessity: and whether appeares to be greater, that must carry us, unlesse some pressing wants of private friends challenge our service from them both, which in matters of moment &amp; importance, to them must be conceived to be cast in by God, as a discharge from any other employment. As for example, The furthering of the Gospell in <hi>New-England,</hi> seemes to bee of more pressing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, and consequently by a stronger band to call mee on to that worke, then the State at home to my continuance here; for here though I may doe something for the advancing of Religion, yet my labours that way are not so needfull in the land, because many others may put too their hands to the same work. In <hi>New-England</hi> there are none to undergo the task: but in this case if the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my fathers life or estate required my stay, that is a discharge unto me from this call to <hi>New-England;</hi>


                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:12004:21"/>
not because his life or estate is of greater weight then the Churches good, but because his necessity is greater; for no body can procure my fathers safety but my selfe, other men besides my selfe may doe the Church this service. Thus men that are free from engagement may see what weights are allowed to bee cast into the ballance to determine their stay or removall.</p>
               <p>All the difficulty that remaines, is, who shall cast the scales (that is) who shall determine which benefit or necessity is the greater? No question that which conscience well informed, assures mee to be so: but who shall informe my conscience, or by what rule shall my conscience judge? It is out of peradventure that God must informe the conscience. But how shall I discover what God adviseth? It is as certaine that if the word, by scanning the grounds which it proposeth, can give a Seer resolution, it must be followed. <hi>The things that are revealed belong unto us and our children that we may doe them,</hi> Deut. 29. 29. But many rules of Scripture though cleere in themselves, yet are doubtfull and ambiguous in the application, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they cannot determine particulars. In this case then wee must have recourse to Christian wisdome; assisted: First, By the advise and counsell of godly wise friends. Secondly, By the observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the concurrence of opportunities, <hi>Occasiones sunt Dei nutus.</hi> Thirdly, By and consideration of the inclination of the heart proposing a right end


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:12004:22"/>
scope after frequent and earnest prayer. A resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion taken after all these meanes used, as in Gods presence, without prejudice, with a sincere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to know and bee informed of Gods will, and obey it, may be taken for the voice of God at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and ought to direct the practise, though it binde not the conscience to embrace the things resolved for an infallible and onely the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable direction. And the truth is, that unlesse this advise and resolution by Christian wisedome, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the generall rules of Gods word to our owne particular case after wee have sought coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of God, and our Christian friends may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted for a rule to direct our practise, I know not what rule to prescribe to bee followed. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose I would marry a wife, nothing but Christian wisedome so assisted, as is expressed before, can shew mee which is the woman.</p>

                  <p>It is reported that when <hi>Annshal</hi> lay before <hi>Rome,</hi> it discouraged him much in his hopes of taking the Citty, that at the same instant there marched out of the Citty at contrary gates un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their colours an Armie of souldiers towards the sea, to be shipped &amp; sent over for a supply into <hi>Spaine;</hi> for it argued the <hi>Romans</hi> feared him not, that durst spare a supplie of men to a Countrie so farre distant when the enemie lay at the gates: And it seemes to argue courage rather than feare, when in the weakest condition of the Church men testifie their hope and expectation of the enlargement of that Kingdome of Christ which wicked men and his enemies glorie that they have as good as conquered and subdued. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive those that engage themselves in this adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are not so void of Religion as to conceive the scourge of God cannot reach them in <hi>New-England;</hi> or of reason, as to thinke <hi>New-England</hi> safer than olde.

                  <p>If that should be a true and reall feare, and not a pretence, I should much wonder that any man should have so little insight into the disposition of his owne Country-men. Howsoever some men are content to remove from their dwellings, and to leave their beloved Countrie and friends, let no man conceive we shall finde over-many of that humour: We are knowne too well to the world to love the smoake of our owne chimneyes so well, that hopes of great advantages are not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

to draw many of us from home: And that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently appeares by the different habits and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the mindes of men unto this voyage. Some pittie the exposing of their friends, or such unto whom for the report of their honestie and religion they wish well, unto so many dangers and inconveniences; others and the most part scoffe at their folly; a third sort murmure and grudge that they are abandoned and forsaken by them: and good men dispute the warrant of their undertaking this worke, and will not be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. It may be, private interests may prevaile with some; One brother may draw over ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a sonne the father, and perhaps some man his inward acquaintance; but let no man feare the over-hasty removall of multitudes of any of estate or abilitie. As for the poorer sort it is true, many of them that want meanes to maintaine them at home, would be glad to passe over into <hi>New-England</hi> to finde a better condition there; but by what meanes will they be transported, or provided of necessaries for so chargeable a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney? and without such provisions they will be found very unwelcome to such as are alreadie planted there. Besides, it cannot be doubted but the State will be so watchfull as not to suffer any prejudice unto it selfe, if the numbers of those that leave her should increase too fast.

Yea but they have taken Ministers with them that are knowne to be unconformable, and they are the men that will sway in the orders of the Church? Neither all nor the greatest part of the Ministers are unconformable. But how shall they prevent it? What Minister among us well seated in a good living, or in faire expectance of one, will be content to leave a certaine mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, to expose himselfe to the manifold hazards of so long a journey, to rest upon the providence of God, when all is done, for provision for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and his family? Pardon them if they take such Ministers as they may have, rather than none at all. Hath any conformable Minister of worth, and fit for that employment, tendred his service, whom they have rejected? No man can affirme they have taken such out of choise rather than necessity, unlesse it be manifested where they have refused others whom they might have had. But there are some unconformable men amongst them, yea and men of worse condition too? And if there were no drunkards nor covetous persons nor vicious any way, it would and might justly

And surely, as farre as guesse by circumstances may leade us, we have more cause to thinke that they are so minded than otherwise; because this will certainely be the consequent of their going out from amongst us, which they cannot but foresee: and if they had meant otherwise, their way had beene to remaine in the midst of us as thornes in our eyes, and prickes in our sides, and not to depart from us: seeing wee know it is the remaining of the thorne in the midst of the flesh which torments; the plucking it out, and casting it away breedes ease and quietnesse.</p>

And after a yeares experience or two of the Soyle and Inhabitants, sent home tydings of both, and of their well-being there, which occasioned other men to take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the place, and to take it into conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>

About the yeare 1623. some Westerne <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants</hi> (who had continued a trade of fishing for Cod and bartering for Furres in those parts for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers yeares before) conceiving that a Colony plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the Coast might further them in those em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, bethought themselves how they might bring that project to effect, and communicated their purpose to others, alledging the conveniency of compassing their proiect with a small charge, by the opportunitie of their fishing trade, in which they accustomed to double-man their Ships, that (by the helpe of many hands) they might dispatch their Voyage, and lade their Ship with Fish while the fishing season lasted, which could not be done with a bare sayling company. Now it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that the fishing being ended the spare men that were above their necessary saylers, might be left behind with provisions for a yeare; and when that Ship returned the next yeare, they might as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist them in fishing, as they had done the former yeare; and, in the meane time, might employ them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in building, and planting Corne, which with the provisions of Fish, Foule, and Venison, that the Land yeelded, would affoord them the chiefe of their foode. This Proposition of theirs tooke so well, that it drew on divers persons, to joyne with them in this project, the rather because it was conceived that not onely their owne Fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but the rest of our Nation that went thither on the same errand, might be much advantaged, not onely by fresh victuall, which that Colony might spare them in time, but withall, and more,


<pb n="69" facs="tcp:12004:30"/>
by the benefit of their Ministers labours, which they might enjoy during the fishing season; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as otherwise being usually upon those Voyages nine or ten moneths in the yeare, they were left all the while without any meanes of instruction at all. Compassion towards the Fishermen, and partly some expectation of gaine, prevailed so farre that for the planting of a Colony in <hi>New-England</hi> there was raised a Stocke of more then three thousand pounds, intended to be payd in in fiue yeares, but afterwards disbursed in a shorter time.</p>
                  <p>How this Stocke was employed, and by what errours and over-sights it was wasted, is I confesse not much pertinent to this subject in hand: Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, because the knowledge thereof may be of use for other mens direction, let me crave leave in a short Digression to present vnto the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders view, the whole order of the managing of such monies as were collected, with the successe and issue of the businesse vndertaken.</p>

               <p>THE first imployment then of this new raised Stocke, was in buying a small Ship of fiftie tunnes, which was with as much speed as might be dispatched towards <hi>New-England</hi> vpon a Fishing Voyag:</p>

The third yeare 1625. both Ships with a small Vessell of fortie tuns which carried Kine with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prouisions, were againe set to Sea upon the same Voyage with the charge of two thousand pounds, of which summe the Company borro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, &amp; became indebted for one thousand pounds and upwards. The great Ship being commanded by a uery able Master, hauing passed on about two hundred leagues in her Voyage, found her selfe so leake by the Carpenters fault, (that looked not well to her Calking) that she bare up the Helme and returned for <hi>Waymouth,</hi> &amp; having unladen her provisions and mended her leake, set her selfe to Sea againe; resolving to take aduice of the Windes whether to passe on her former. Voyage or to turne into <hi>New-found-land,</hi> which she did, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that the time was so far spent, that the Master and Company dispaired of doing any good in <hi>New-England:</hi> where the Fish falls in two or three mounths sooner then at <hi>New found land.</hi> There she tooke Fish good store and much more then she could lade home: the overplus should have beene sold and deliuered to some sacke or other sent to take it in there, if the Voyage had beene well man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged.</p>
               <p>But that could-not be done by reason that the Ship before she went was not certaine where to make her Fish; by this accident it fell out that a good quantitie of the Fish she tooke was cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and some other part was brought home in another Ship. At the returne of the Ships that yeare, Fish by reason of our warres with <hi>Spaine</hi>


                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:12004:31"/>
falling to a very low rate; the <hi>Company</hi> endevoured to send the greater Ship for <hi>France:</hi> but she being taken short with a contrary Winde in the West-Country, and intelligence given in the meane time that those Markets were over-laid, they were en-Forced to bring her backe againe, and to sell her Fish at home as they might. Which they did, and with it the Fish of the smaller Ship, the <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Fish about ten shillings the hundred by tale or there about; the <hi>New-found-Land</hi> Fish at six shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings foure pence the hundred, of which was well nigh eight pence the hundred charge raised vpon it after the Ships returne: by this reason the Fish which at a Market in all likely-hood might have yeelded well nigh two thousand pounds, amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not with all the Provenue of the Voyage to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue eleaven hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Vnto these losses by Fishing were added two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther no small disaduantages, the one in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try by our <hi>Land-Men,</hi> who being ill chosen and ill commanded, fell into many disorders and did the <hi>Company</hi> little seruice: The other by the fall of the price of Shipping, which was now abated to more then the one halfe, by which meanes it came to passe, that our Ships which stood vs in little lesse then twelue hundred pounds, were sold for foure hundred and eighty pounds.</p>
               <p>The occasions and meanes then of wasting this stocke are apparently these. First, the ill choice of the place for fishing; the next, the ill carriage of our men at Land, who having stood vs in two yeares and a halfe in well nigh one thousand


<pb n="74" facs="tcp:12004:32"/>
pound charge, never yeelded one hundred pound profit. The last the ill sales of Fish and Shipping. By all which the <hi>Aduenturers</hi> were so far discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, that they abandoned the further prosecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Designe, and tooke order for the dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the <hi>Company</hi> on Land, and sold away their Shipping and other Provisions.</p>
               <p>Two things withall may be intimated by the way, the first, that the very proiect it selfe of planting by the helpe of a fishing Voyage, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver answer the successe that it seemes to promise (which experienced Fisher-men easily have fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene before hand, and by that meanes haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented divers ensuing errors) whereof amongst divers other reasons these may serue for two. First that no sure fishing place in the Land is fit for planting, nor any good place for planting found fit for fishing, at least neere the Shoare. And secondly, rarely any Fisher-men will worke at Land, neither are Husband-men fit for Fisher-men but with long vse &amp; experience. The second thing to be obserued is, that nothing new fell out in the managing of this stocke seeing experience hath taught vs that as in building houses the first stones of the foundation are buried vnder ground, and are not seene, so in planting Colonies, the first stockes employed that way are consumed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they serue for a foundation to the worke.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> The Conclusion of the whole Treatise.</head>
               <p>NOw for the better preventing of such sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitions and jealousies, and the ill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to this Worke, that may arise thereupon; two things are earnestly requested of such as passe their Censures upon it, or the persons that undertake it. The first is, that although in this barien and corrupt age wherein we live, all our actions are generally swayed and carryed on by private interests; in so much as sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere intentions of furthering the common good; (grounded upon that love through which wee are commanded to serve one another) be the wonders of men; notwithstanding men would not thinke it impossible, that the love which waxeth cold and dyeth in the most part, yet may revive and kindle in some mens hearts: and that there may be found some that may neglect their case and profit to doe the Church good and God service, out of a sincere love and affection to Gods honour and the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches good. Why may not wee conceive that God may prevaile upon the hearts of his servants, to set them on as effectually to seeke the inlargement of his kingdome; as a blind zeale fomented by the art and subtiltie of Satan may thrust on Priests and Iesuites, and their partisans, to engage their persons and estates for the advancing of the Devils Kingdome? Or if in the Worlds infancy, men out


<pb n="80" facs="tcp:12004:34"/>
of an ambitious humour, or at present for private advantages and expectation of gaine, thrust them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves out from their owne dwellings into parts farre remote from their native soyle; why should not we conceive, that if they doe this for a corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible crowne; that the desire and expectation of an incorruptible (the reward of such as deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for the service of God and his Church) may as strongly allure such as by patient co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance in well-doing, seeke immortalitie &amp; life? And yet the favourable conceits that men entertaine of such as follow in all their actions the wayes of their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate gaine, and the jealousies that they are apt to entertaine of such as pretend onely the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Gospell,</hi> manifestly argue that the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall opinion of the world is that some may be true to themselves and the advancement of their owne private estates, but hardly any to God and his Church. I should be very unwilling to thinke, they cherish this suspition upon that ground that moved that sensuall Emperour to beleeve that no man was cleane or chaste in any part of his body, because himselfe was defiled and uncleane in all. This is then the first favour that is desired, of such as consider this action, to beleeve that it is neither impossible nor unlikely that these mens intentions are truely and really such as they pretend, and not collours and cloakes for secret dangerous purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, which they closely harbour in their breasts, especially when all apparant circumstances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre to justifie the contrary.</p>
               <p>

                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:12004:34"/>
The next request that is presented to all indifre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent minded men is; that they would be pleased to set before their eyes that which hath beene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie mentioned, that as there followed the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Israel</hi> a mixt multitude out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> so it is probable there may doe these men out of <hi>England,</hi> and that of divers tempers: some perhaps men of hot and fiery spirits, making change and innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their scope, may conceive that (when they see that for the desire and care of preserving unitie and love, and taking away occasions of offence to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der consciences, some changes and alterations are yeelded unto) they have gained what they expect, and may as fondly triumph in their supposed Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, as if they had overthrowne all order and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline; as they doe absurdly mistake the grounds and ends which the course of Government propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth and aymeth at: and thereupon in their Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to their friends, represent things not as they are really done and intended, but as they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them in their fantasies. Others there will be that prooving refractary to Government, expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all libertie in an unsetled body; and finding the restraint of Authority, contrary to expectation, in their discontented humours, meeting with no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way of revenge, may be ready to blemish the Government with such scandalous reports as their malicious spirits can devise and utter.</p>
               <p>Now although some say, that malice is a good informer, notwithstanding no wise or good man admits it for a fit Iudge; if therefore men will be


<pb n="82" facs="tcp:12004:35"/>
pleased to forbeare the over-hastie beliefe of such reports, as shall be sent over or given out, either by men of foolish and weake mindes or distempered humors, untill they receive more assured satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from such as understand and are acquainted with the grounds and secret passages of the affayres of Government, they shall keepe their owne hearts upon the even-ballance of a right judgement, and provide for the innocency of those upon whom they passe their censure.</p>
               <p>If by these meanes jealousies and suspitions may be prevented, I make no question but the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which this Worke hath both to the State and Church, will upon mature advise so farre pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile with all well-minded men, as to move them not onely to affoord their prayers for the prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous successe of this new planted Colony, that from small and contemptible beginnings, it may grow to a setled and well formed Church; but with all their best furtherance, <hi>Consilio, auxilio, re,</hi> by advise, friends, and purses. Which howsoever the principalls of this worke, out of their mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, crave not, yet the necessary burdens which so weightie an undertaking chargeth them withall, will certainely inforce them to need, whatsoever men judge to the contrary. Neither is or will the burden be intolerable to this State; A common stocke of ten thousand pound may be sufficient to support the weight of generall charges of transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and maintaining Ministers, Schoole-Masters, Commanders for Warres; and erecting of such


<pb n="83" facs="tcp:12004:35"/>
buildings as will be needfull for publique use for the present; and for time to come it cannot be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned but the Colony it selfe having once taken roote, when mens labours beginne to yeeld them any fruit, will be found sufficient to beare her own burden. Alas, what were it for a Marchant or a Gentleman of reasonable estate, to disburse twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie-fiue pound or fiftie pound, for the propagating of the <hi>Gospell,</hi> who casts away in one yeare much more upon superfluities in apparell, dyet, buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, &amp;c: and let men seriously weigh and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with themselves, whether a worke of so great importance, so neerely concerning Gods honour, and the service of the Church calling upon them (as <hi>Lazarus</hi> upon <hi>Dives</hi>) for some of the wast of their superfluous expences; if they lend a deafe eare to the motion, will not assuredly plead strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against them at the barre of Christs judgement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feate at the last day? Nay, what a scorne would it be to the Religion we professe, that we should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to purchase the propagation of it at so easie a rate, when the Popish partie charge themselves with such excessiue expences; for the advancement of idolatry and superstition? Its true, it will be valued at a low rate, that the Colony is able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne you againe by way of recompence; perhaps the enjoying of such immunities and priviledges, as his Majestie hath beene pleased to grant unto them, and an hundred or two hundred acres of Land to every man that shall disburse twentie-fiue pound, and so for more proportionablie, for the


<pb n="84" facs="tcp:12004:36"/>
raising of the common Stocke; yet their posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie (if not themselves) may have cause in time to come, to acknowledge it a good purchase that was made at so low a rate: but if they lend, looking for nothing againe, wee know the promise <hi>Luk. 6. 35.</hi> he is no looser, that hath made <note place="margin">Your reward shall be great, and you shall be the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Highest <hi>Luk. 6. 35.</hi>
