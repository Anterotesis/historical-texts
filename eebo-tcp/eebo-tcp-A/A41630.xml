            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HE who included <hi>Homer</hi>'s <hi>Ilias</hi> in a Nutshell, made a very good Kernell for it, if the Brevity in Writing was not compensated with as great Obscurity, and difficulty in Reading. Wheras in this Divine History, we have the <hi>Genesis,</hi> and System of the whole World, in one Leaf, yea one Page, delineated as in a Mapp; not without sufficient Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as I shall shew in my Explications. And as God hath left farther In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into Particulars to Human Ingeny and Industry, I accordingly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiate in my Illustrations, still keeping as close to the Text, as I may; for, <hi>longius a Verbo, longius a Vero.</hi> Wherin though I cannot be as Brief as I would, yet I have studied as much Clearnes as I could, without Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gramm or Sculpture; and purposely repeat some more difficult Conceptions, that others may better understand them: which yet I do not expect they should presently embrace, becaus I know that I could not so suddenly satisfy myself concerning them: and whosoever would so satisfy himself, must throughly read, and as throughly consyder the whole <hi>Series.</hi> The Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script hath suffered many Expunctions and Interlineations, which rendred it not so Legible; and my absence from the Press permitted some fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

However I expose it, such as it is, among my own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimen, from whom I willingly expect many Learned Observations, and Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Reflections, which shall help me to perfect, and prepare it for another Language. The exquisite Poets in the time of <hi>Augustus</hi> (as I find in <hi>Ovid</hi>) used first to recite privately one to another: and I remember Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> told me, that he and <hi>Heinsius</hi> used to communicate Notes toward some of their Works. <hi>Schola Salerni, Collegium Conimbricense,</hi> and others, wrote in Common: which certeinly is a very great advantage; where many collect the Materials, and one is the Composer and Architect of the Work, and then all review and rectify it. But I, who live alone in the Country farr from <hi>Athens,</hi> must proceed otherwise, and as Inferior <hi>Animals,</hi> first ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THe Title bespeaks the Dedication of this discours of the World to the World; which if it were Animal, as <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> fansied, would most freely acknowledg and subscribe to the Divine History of its own Creation: But I write to the Animate and Intelligent World of Mankind, both present and future; and more specially to the Christian World, (which is now almost the whole World of Learning) but most particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the British World, whose Language I therefore speak. Now though Men in these latter Ages of the World seem to forget the Original Creation therof so many Thousand Years past, certainly <hi>Adam</hi> the first Man, who was immediately Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God, was very Conscious of his own Creation; nor could he by his Fall lose this Natural Knowledg, more than of being a Man: and most probably he delivered this great Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to his Posterity; who also reteined it, while they could reckon themselves in succession, as <hi>Enoch</hi> the Seventh, and <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> the Tenth from <hi>Adam.</hi> But afterward in or about the Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Generation; when <hi>Nimrod</hi> the Mighty Hunter and his Impious faction began to build the Tower of <hi>Babel,</hi> (whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ensued the Confusion of Languages) this Knowledg also began to be Confounded; and thenceforth remained with the Primitive Language only in the family of <hi>Heber,</hi> the Father of the Hebrews (in whose days the Earth was divided when his eldest Son <hi>Peleg</hi> was born) and in his Sacred Seed after him. And from the Hebrews living in <hi>Chaldaea</hi> the Chaldaeans first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived their Philosophy; and so after them the Egyptians, and Phoenicians; and from them the Graecians; mingling it with
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61550:7"/>
their several Superstitions and Idolatries. And as <hi>Iosephus</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth, <hi>Nimrod</hi> first taught his Babylonians to contemn Gods Power and Providence; which he could not do without a denial of the Creation. Whence the Chaldaeans began to worship the Creature, or Created Nature, instead of God the Creator: but principally the Sun, and Fire, as the Supreme and most Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Element. The Egyptians who would also have their National Deity, did Idolise Water rather than Fire; induced thereunto by a Gratitude to their Great Benefactor the River <hi>Nilus.</hi> The P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oenicians, Graecians, Romans, and generaly all the more West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Nations, have worshiped all the Elements, under several Names, and in the several Forms and Images wherewith they pleased to Invest them; deducing them all from <hi>Coelum</hi> and <hi>Terra,</hi> or Heaven and Earth, (which the Chineses still worship) But <hi>Pan</hi> and <hi>Proteus,</hi> whereby they represented Matter and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were by all esteemed <hi>Dii Minorum Gentium.</hi> This Antient Theogony is also Recorded and Celebrated by the Poets. Which though afterward the Athenian Philosophers did more strictly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin, yet the Tradition of a <hi>Chaos</hi> and Creation did very long continue among them: but they supposed the Creation of the World by one Chief God to have been Eternal like himself, with certain Revolu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ions of Time, and Transmigrations of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, Eternally Circulating and Changing by Perpetual Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Corruption; believing the Lying Records of Egyptian Antiquity, from whom also <hi>Pythagoras</hi> learned his Philosophy, and fansied I know not what Harmony of the Spheres: with many such Fictions, which he by his own <hi>Ipse Dixit</hi> pleased to Affirm, and Impose as <hi>Credenda</hi> on his Disciples. And <hi>Plato,</hi> being part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Follower of his Sect, and partly a Master of another, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally reteined and refined this Philosophy. But <hi>Aristotle</hi> reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Matters of Faith, both Divine, and Human, and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all things only by Reason, descended lower even to a first Matter, affirming it, and the <hi>Potentia</hi> thereof, to be Common Principle of all Material things. Upon which false Foundation, and also his Compliance with popular Idolatry, almost all his other Errors are grounded; though otherwise I esteem him the greatest Master of Reason among all Pagan Philosophers: and his Errors are not Dangerous being now so well known to all. But as <hi>Moses</hi> is the only Divine and true Philosopher; so of them
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61550:7"/>
all I acknowledg <hi>Aristotle</hi> to be his best Commentator. <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> departed from both these ways of Knowledg, regarding Sens more than either Reason or Faith. Whereas these three, being all, and the only Ways of Human Knowledg a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher should accordingly make use of them all: and therefore all Heathen Philosophy, wanting the Divine Light of Faith, could never yet produce any Complete System of the World, nor give any true and satisfactory Account therof. And this Universal Dissatisfaction begat the last of Sects which was Scepticism, or a professed Denying or Doubting all things whatsoever: admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting no Testimony or Evidence either of Faith, Reason, or Sens. But though Doubting may be a good Disciple, yet certainly it can be no Master of Philosophy; and if it be Affected and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved is the very Contradiction therof, and Oppugner of all Knowledg, both Divine, and Human, Speculative, and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical: and however some may esteem it Caution in Philosophy, it is plainly Libertinism in Morality, and Infidelity in Theology: and any Dogmatical Error or Inconvenience can hardly be greater than Total Scepticism, which is as Utter Darkness, and the State of Desperation, the Bottomless pit, and <hi>Vorago</hi> of all Knowledg and Practice. Now as this was formerly the Progress of Heathenish Philosophy, so since Christianity Illuminated the World, yet through the Natural Darkness and Corruption of Human Understanding, it hath again had the same Revolutions. For so first Platonical Philosophy, which <hi>Porphyrius, Plotinus, Iam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blichus,</hi> and others very much rectified and refined by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Light of Christianity, was by them opposed against it. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so <hi>Philo Iudaeus,</hi> and <hi>Origen,</hi> and some of the Christian Fathers seem to have some Savor therof. Afterward the Schoolmen generally referring Matters of Faith to Scripture, and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Nature by Reason, rather embraced the Peripatetical Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, which hath long continued, untill in this last Age, some others, though they can discover nothing which the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian Wits had not Invented before them, yet reviving and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing old Errors, like Fashions, relaps again to Epicurism, in one kind or other, of Atoms, or Corpuscles, or the like, And when this Humor hath lasted as long as it did formerly, we may expect Scepticism to succeed: and indeed I suspect that we are already in the very Confines therof. Now though Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61550:8"/>
Wits think they may thus dally with Opinions as they please; yet, as it is most truly said, <hi>Studia abeunt in Mores</hi>: and so <hi>Virgil</hi> very aptly introduceth Drunken <hi>Silenus</hi> changing the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picurean Opinion, but Grave <hi>Anchises</hi> more soberly Platonising. Certainly their Novell Doctrine of Matter and Motion doth much Embase the Immaterial Spirit of Man, and render it more Gross and Sensual, and unfit for Spiritual and Divine Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations. And though I believ some of the Assertors therof to be as far from Atheism as my self, yet I must freely profess that the Assertion tendeth toward it, and was by Heathens Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved to the Denial of a Creation; and I appeal to every Reader whether it doth not Induce some Suspicion therof in himself; yea I suppose this to be chiefly that which renders i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Inextricable Labyrinth of Matter and Motion; and the <hi>Magnum Inane</hi> of Vacuity, and at last plunged into the Abyss of Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Scepticism. I have no Petulant Humor, yet it may exceed the Meekness and Patience of my Great Master <hi>Moses,</hi> to hear some Christians affirm the very Essences and Formalities of all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lementary, Vegetative, yea even sensitive Natures, to be only Matter and Motion: as <hi>Aaron</hi> said of his Materials; <hi>I cast them into the fire, and there came out this Calf</hi>: and so to set up several Figures of things, as the Jews did the Figures which they had made; and Heathenish Idolaters their Idols and Images. Wheras indeed it is rather the Art of a Statuary, than of a Philosopher, thus to make <hi>Mercurius Ex quolibet ligno</hi>: or as he who having only an <hi>Hercules</hi> of Wax in his shop, when one came to buy of him a <hi>Mercury,</hi> could presently turn his Beard into a <hi>Galerus,</hi> his Club into a <hi>Caduceus,</hi> and his Buskins into <hi>Talaria</hi>; and so he might as well have made thereof a <hi>Iupiter, Iuno, Venus,</hi> Man, Beast, or Tree, or as we say <hi>Quidlibet ex quolibet</hi>: Which yet shou'd be only Wax varied. Thus our new Philosophers, not acknowledging all those several Primitive Natures which God in his Infinite Wisedom pleased to Create, like Etymologists, can derive one thing from another so far as scarcely to leav any Primitives. <hi>Cartacean</hi> Philosophy, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes the World in Paper otherwise then God hath made it to be in Nature, beginning, <hi>Cogito, Ergo Sum,</hi> and so proceeding, <hi>Cogito, Ergo Est</hi>: as though becaus the Operation doth indeed prove the Essence of the Cogitant, it did therefore also prove the Real Entity of any thing Cogitated: and yet this is all the Argument it can afford us to prove that First and Fundamental Truth, That there is a God, <hi>Cogito esse Deum, Ergo Est.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the most Judicious and Ingenious Father, long before had Invented the first Argument, when disputing with a Sceptike, he first proves that he Is, because he doubts whether he Is or not; and because he is a Creature, thereby also proves that there is a God the Creatour: whom I shall rather chose to follow than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such Neophytes; who, when God saith in the Beginning he made Heaven and Earth, say he made only Matter and Motion; and professing that they had deliberated and tried to deduce all this Spectable World from a <hi>Chaos,</hi> or from Matter only diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sified by its own Motion, Figure, and the like; have asserted it to be Matter; whereas God expresly declareth that he Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

Whereupon I may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry truly and safely pronounce; <hi>Aut haec non est Scriptura, aut i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ta non est Philosophia.</hi> For mine own part I must here profess, that having long since studied Philosophy in the University, and read over several Philosophers, both Antient, and Modern, I could never find a satisfaction in any of them: and if I had not reflected on this Divine History, should have been tempted, as others, to Invent some new Philosophy suitable to mine own Fansy: For now he is no Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher who willnot attempt to make a new Philosophical World, and produce his Module therof; shewing how it might be best made, and with least Charges: but certainly it is most Ridiculous and Impious thus to presume that God must therefore have made the World ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Module, becaus we judge it best; rather than ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that to be best which he hath made, becaus he who made it is Infinitely Wiser than us. Wherefore to find out how God made the World, I had recours to his Word, reading o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this first Chapter of <hi>Genesis</hi> again and again; and also many Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators, in whom generaly (besides the first Article of our Creed concerning God the Maker of Heaven and Earth) I found more of <hi>Aristotle</hi> than of <hi>Moses</hi>; (yea even Translators seem to incline that way) but the Cabalistical Rabbins, and Scholastical Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers, by their Jewish, and Heathenish Interpretations, have so Confounded and Obnubilated this Divine Light, that almost all Christians fear to approach it; and seem rather to dread and adore it at a distance as some Inscrutable Mystery: and some think they greatly favor Scripture by restraining it to Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy and Morality, and not intitling it to Natural Philosophy; and so, as it were going backward, cover it with the Mantle of their Indulgence, that the Philosophical Nakedness thereof may not appear to themselves or others. Whereas considering for what end this Divine History of Created Nature was writ, and being suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently confident of the Intrinsecal Verity, and Extrinsecal Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence thereof, I adventured to look into the Naked Simplicity of the Text, and endeavored first to discover the plain and true System of the World, which God the Creator hath described
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61550:9"/>
therin, and therby reveled unto us. Which I have according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expressed in my Explications; being only a brief Philosophical Paraphrase upon the Text: and yet while I thus Explicate the Text by my Paraphrase, I still submit my Paraphrase to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Text: and I therefore set these Explications, as a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, or <hi>Cancelli,</hi> between the Divine Word and my Human Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrations therof: which I have also deduced from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Nature, as the Counterpart of Scripture; and have heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Voice therof, as to the <hi>Echo</hi> of the Creating Voice of God. Nor do I dissent from Pagan Philosophy <hi>Animo Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicendi,</hi> or to flatter Christianity (which is far above it) but shall also retein any thing of Truth that I have found therin; and all advantages therof, either Platonical Speculations, Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patetical Ratiocinations, or Epicurean Sensations, yea even Sceptical Caution it self: and am Dogmatical only in such <hi>Theses</hi> which according to the Law that I impose on my self, I shall first prove by the Concurrence of Divine Authority, Human Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Sensible Experiment: and if I knew any more ways of Probation, should not decline, but most gladly embrace them. Neither do I thus offer any thing to the World wherof I have not first satisfied my self after so long trial and strict examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; wher in I could never yet find any thing considerable, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Reason, or Sens, which I could not fairly reconcile to the Divine Authority of the Text. Also I have adventured to propound many <hi>Hypotheses</hi>; which though I dare not so confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Assert, yet I should not Insert them, if I did not esteem them very Probable: for indeed it is the most proper, and a sufficient Task for any Philosopher, to Inquire only what God hath Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated: and I ever reputed it a great Vanity in any who presume to go farther, and will also offer to shew what he might have Created: not without some Insinuation of what one most Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanely Expressed, That if he had stood at Gods elbow when he made the World, he could have shewed him how to have made it better: as though whatsoever Hypothetical Natures, or Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Worlds, they please to fansy and describe,

But though I shall carefully exclude any such Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable Trifles, yet I doubt not but that among so many sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Probabilities, I may run into some Errors, and many <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rata</hi> in Terms of Art, and such other <hi>Peccadillos,</hi> which may prove Scandalous and Offensive to Weaker Minds, who regard Words more than Things; and may be matter enough of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and Disparagement to the Captious, who though they can find no fault in <hi>Venus</hi> her self, will Carp at her Sandal, or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing about her. And I am Conscious that I may be more lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hereunto, being no Mathematician, Astronomer, Chymist, or other Artist whatsoever; but one among the Laity of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, having only two Books which I regard, Scripture, and Nature: and though any may easily bite through my Human In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, yet he sha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nor will I presume to add any thing to Divine Authority, professing it to be my chief Designe to Exalt it as the only <hi>Statera</hi> of Truth, both Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and Supernatural; and as we Eminently call it Scripture and Bible, so it is indeed the Writing of all Writings, and Book of all Books; whereby <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Probabilitys. Wheras this foundation laid in Scripture is as sure as Nature it self; which both are the Work and Word of the same Divine Creator; and every Superstructure rightly built therupon shall stand. Now though I may not presume to be any such Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-builder; yet I think it a very great Work effected, if I may reduce others to this Fundamental System, and provoke them to build upon it; as I have begun, and offered this rude Essay: and though they shall pleas to Demolish my whole Fabrike, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs to Erect any other, and lay upon it <hi>Gold, Silver, Pretious Stones, Wood, Hay, Stubble,</hi> or what they list, I have my Designe; which is to Assert this to be the only true Foundation of Natural Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, as well as of Theology, and Morality. <hi>And the Fire shall try every mans Work of what sort it is.</hi> And so I not only Dedicate this my Work unto the World (as indeed every Writer writes to all by making his Writing Publike) but also I Appeal unto it, and make every Reader my Judg: for I do not presume to teach the World; nor shall I, as others, term it the People that knoweth not the Law of Nature; for though it consist of many Heads, and almost as many Sentences, yet I do not find but that the last Result, and that wherin they Acquiesce, is Truth: whose common Fate in the World is first to be gazed on, and perhaps derided and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned, and at last after farther scrutiny to be enterteined and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced; and the Fate of Error contrary therunto, first to be Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded and Admired, and so received withou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus Truth is the Daughter of Time; and as Time is the best Critike, so I esteem <hi>Homer, Virgil,</hi> and such others, to have been the best of Poets, and <hi>Plato,</hi> and <hi>Aristotle,</hi> the best of Philosophers; becaus their Works have so long survived; wheras there are only some Fragments of <hi>Epicurus</hi> now remaining, as bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and minute as his Corpuscles or Atoms, Certeinly Scripture is both most Antient, and also most Intire. Nor can I suppose that the Discovery of any consyderable Natural Truth, or Profitable Good to Mankind, hath been renounced, or will ever be lost by them.

And now after so many Christian Ages, let it be once Determined, whether this be a true History of the Creation, or not; and if it be, (as most undoubtedly it is) let us no longer be bereaved of so great a Treasure, which hath hitherto I know not how been not only hid under ground, but trampled on by the feet of men. Nor let any Elude and Enervate it by the Imputation of Popularity, whereby even Popular Understandings may learn Divine Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy; as the Psalmist professeth, that thereby he had acquired <hi>More Understanding then all his Teachers.</hi> Nor let us resigne not only our Faith, but also our own Reason to others, becaus they pleas to abandon theirs, and scoffingly call it Logical, or Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physical, or the like; which are the Acquests of those Noble Arts and Sciences, whereby we excell Brutes, Barbarians, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs. Nor may they justly term this a Prejudice against them; for how do they Prejudg? who Appeal to the whole World, or the Great University of Mankind; and as good Scribes bring forth out of their Treasure things New and Old: doing herein like Galenists, who willingly admit and add to their Dispensatorys any Chymical Experiments which are sound and useful (and to such Physicians all wise Patients commit their Bodys rather then to Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirikes) Or are they prejudiced? who affirm nothing but what they prove by all the ways of Probation, Authority, Argument, and Experiment. For to what Judg can we Appeal but the World, or to what Law but Faith, Reason, and Sens? and may we not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther suspect the Prejudice to ly in Novelty and Party, and a new Sect of men, who admit only sens, and yet will not be Judged by that, unless it speak their Sens? But as I have not pawned the Authority of mine own Name, upon which I know I could bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row very little; so I only beg of others; that neither any Passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Amours which they may have for any Man or his Opinions, nor the Inebriating Fansys of their own Spirits, nor any pretended Monarchy or Monopoly of Knowledg, may be by them Opposed to Truth; for <hi>Magna est Veritas &amp; praevaelebit</hi>: and I doubt not but that <hi>Scriptum est,</hi> and <hi>Probatum est,</hi> will by their own Intrinsecal Value, without any Image or Superscription, pass Current through
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61550:11"/>
the whole Christian World. But let us all rather Consult toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Advancement of true Knowledg, and the Real Benefits of Mankind; both in Speculation, and Action: Wherof the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative Part doth properly belong to Scholes and Academys, who, if they shall make this Divine History of the Creation to be their <hi>Symbolum Philosophicum,</hi> shall need no other Fundamentals; nor have they any better way to preserv their Disciples from these new Philosophical Romances of <hi>Mundus Alter, &amp; Idem.</hi> And as it hath been much wished by Wise men that Scholars would season their Studys with more of Common Life and Civil Conversation (the want wherof hath been the Scandal and Scorn of Learning) so particularly Academical Philosophers should hearken more to Experiments, which though it be not fit for themselvs to Practice, yet they may Inquire of Chymists and Mechanikes, and be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed therof by them, to whom the Practical Part doth properly belong. And Mechanikes may be also much Assisted and Directed by Philosophers, with many Rules and Regular Proportions; whereby they may be Instructed, and also Cautioned from attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Impossibilitys, or any thing Impracticable; as the Philosophers Stone, Perpetual Motion, or Fire, and the like; and also much Advantaged in the Attempts of Possibilitys; as if the Doctrine of Local Motion of Bodys were more fully cleared, and all the Variations therof, not only according to Distances from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Multiplications of Wheels, Pulleys, Leavers, and the like, and all the several Situations and Positions therof; but also all the Mysterys of Increments and Decrements of Velocity, Consistent Strength, Elasticity, Pressure and Nonpressure, Preventions of Vacuity, and the like, were ascerteined unto them, it might great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly help them in contriving their Machins and Engines. It hath been observed that though Speculative Philosophy hath not much Advanced in these last Ages of the World, yet there hath been a great Improvement of Mechanical Arts: but I conceiv that thus both might grow up together. Nor is a Mechanike so mean a Title in Human Society as is commonly reputed; Certeinly the End of all these Speculations is Practice, which doth most Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately promote the Good of Mankind. And if I should endeavor any such Profitable Inventions, I had rather be assisted therin by a Corporation of Mechanikes, then any Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of Philosophers: and I would kiss that mans Hands, yea his
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61550:12"/>
Feet, who should Collect and Publish an exact and faithful History of Artificial Experiments, not only Chymical and Curious, but Mechanical, and of all Trades and Artifices: which together with the History of Extraordinary Natural <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> are very great <hi>Desiderata,</hi> and would be of very much Use and Improvement. But Inventions, as I conceiv, are rather strange Fates and Felicitys; and some <hi>Magnalia</hi> therof have proved as great Treasures to the World as the Indian Mines, which certeinly the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>scovery made by <hi>Columbus</hi> did comprehend. Yet as they are not of Ordinary Production, so neither only Chances, as we term them; but Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Providences of God in some Ages, wherin he designeth thereby to accomplish some greater Intendments: as when God purposed to revele the Glorious Light of the Gospel through the whole World before the second coming of <hi>Christ,</hi> he stirred up the Spirit of <hi>Columbus,</hi> by a strange Dogmatical Confidence of more Earth then was before discovered, maugre all Repulses, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays, Indefatigably, and Undeniably, to endeavor and attempt the Discovery therof: which yet he could never have effected if also the Compass, or Seamans Card, wherof former Ages were Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, had not been then lately Invented; and so likewise the Gun, without which so few Adventurers could never have kept Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against Innumerable Natives. And about the same time Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing also was Invented, to Disseminate Knowledg through both the Worlds. But I do not esteem Additions to be Inventions; as the Telescope or Microscope, which are only farther Improvements of the Perspective, (that was first Invented by a Mechanike:) or as the <hi>Granado</hi> is of the Gun, and the like. Yet we might hope for more both Inventions and Additions, if Philosophy were made more Mechanical, and Mechanike more Philosophical. Wherof we have now the greatest expectation from the happy Institution of the <hi>Roial Society</hi>; and that so many Mercurial Wits, Interced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between both these Regions of Speculation and Practice, will transmit Philosophical Instructions to Mechanikes, and Mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Experiments to Philosophers: and after all their Curious Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitions, and many Vibrations, like the <hi>Pendulum,</hi> setle at last in the most Direct Line of Truth, Proving all things, and holding fast that which is Good, and shall be for the Good of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of all Mankind: which shall render their <hi>Society</hi> a <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons Hous,</hi> and this Island a <hi>New Atlantis.</hi> And as the Lord <hi>Veru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>vine Authority. And if the Active Spirits of this Nation would freely clear and disengage themselvs from the Humor of Forein Noveltys, they might exceed others in their happy Endeavors; though we Tramontanes have been Judged by them better for Imitation then Invention: but I desire them to produce any thing in this last Age equal to those two Noble In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions which were both of English Extraction: that is, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinatory or Dipping Needle, whereby the Latitude is discovered; wherof, as I have received it by Tradition, the Inventor was <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Norman</hi> our Countryman, whose Name deservs more Heral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry; as they will easily acknowledg who shall attempt to Invent the like Natural Instrument, whereby to discover the Longitude. The other is the first Observation of the Circulation of the Bloud, wherof our Learned <hi>Doctor Harvey</hi> is the well known and Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Author. And for Philosophical Discourses and Discoverys of Nature I may name two others; who though Parallel one to another, yet I suppose neither of them can be Parallel'd by any other Nation: that is, the Great <hi>Chancellor Bacon</hi> whose Natural History hath made his own Name H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>storical: and the truly Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Robert Boyle</hi>; of whom I may well say, that as <hi>Hiero</hi> made a Law in <hi>Syracuse</hi> That every one should believ whatsoever <hi>Archime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> affirmed that he could do; so all ought to believ whatsoever this Noble Person declareth that he hath done, in all those manifold Experiments wherewith he hath enriched the World. Now let this be the Conclusion and Summ of the whole matter; That as the End of all Created Nature is the Divine Glory of the Creator, which the whole World as a Mirror was made to Represent to us Naturaly; so should all Spiritualy Render it unto him. And thus we Christians being taught by God, the Author both of Scripture and Nature, truly to know the Creation and System of the World, which Heathen Philosophers groped to find out all their days, and have disputed in all Ages, should with the Primitive Hebrews, and their Divine Doctors, <hi>Moses, David, Solomon,</hi> and the rest, Glorify the Infinite <hi>Iehovah,</hi> Creator of Heaven and Earth. And

I have very much wondered that not only in Spirituals, but also in Naturals, Seing we should not See, and Hearing we should not Hear, and Understand with our Hearts, the things which are writ in such large Characters, and Proclaimed to us with so loud a Voice. Wherefore I beseech the Divine Spirit so to Illuminate us in the true Knowledg of his Word and Works, that henceforth they may be no longer hid from our Eys; but that it may now be said of Holy Scripture, and of the Nativity of the World therin,

               </argument>
               <p n="1">I. THat there was a Begining of the World (besides the Divine Authority of the Text) is as Rationaly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrable, as it is Sensibly evident, That there is a Heaven and Earth: for it is also evident, that they are Bodys, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by Part beyond Part, and therefore Finite, or bounded with Extremitys of that Extension (which we call First, or Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and Last, or End; becaus we may begin to measure at one, and end at the other) for that very Extension which renders them Bodys by Extending Part beyond Part, doth also Terminate them, that is, Extend them so far, and no farther. Thus the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the World hath two great Parts; Heaven, and Earth. And whatsoever hath Parts is Finite, becaus every Part is Finite or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to a Proportion not so great as the Whole, otherwise it should not be a Part of the Whole. And as one Part is Finite, so are all the Parts of the Whole, becaus they are all Parts. And so Consequently is the Whole; becaus it is equal to all the Parts; otherwise it should not be the Whole of all the Parts therof. And thus Heaven, which is one Part of the whole Body of the World, is a less Whole in it self; becaus it is the whole Heaven. And so likewise Earth, which is the other Part of the whole Body of the World, is also a less Whole in it self; becaus it is the whole Earth. Now either of these two less Wholes is Finite in it self; becaus it is only a Part of the whole Body of the World: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus both these less Wholes are Finite, therefore the whole Body
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61550:15"/>
of the World is also Finite, though it be a greater Whole: for there is no Greater nor Less in Infinite, which is Infinitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond any Proportion, and without any Parts whatsoever; becaus a greater Whole is that which hath greater Parts, or more equal Parts; and a less Whole is that which hath less Parts, or fewer equal Parts. And since whatsoever hath Parts is Finite, therfore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever hath greater or more, or less, or fewer Parts, is also Finite, and cannot be Infinite. Again every Part is such a certain Proportion of the Whole as it is, otherwise it should not be such a Part therof; and therefore hath such a certein Measure of it self, whereby it is such a certein Proportion as it is, and not greater nor less. And as all the Proportions of all the Parts, are the Whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the Whole; so all the Measures of all the Parts, are the whole Measure of the Whole. And whatsoever is Mensura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is Finite; becaus it is Mensurable, and not Immens. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the whole Body of the World is Finite, as well as Heaven, and Earth, or any less Part, or the least Particle therof whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; wherof there is the same reason: Otherwise the Whole should be greater then all the Parts, or the Parts greater, or more, then they are, which is Impossible. And the contrary ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of So Mathematicaly true, and evident according to Common Sentence, (that every Part is less then the Whole, and the Whole greater then any Part, and equal to all the Parts therof) that it cannot be further proved by any thing more evident then it self. Wherefore this Conclusion is most true and evident; <hi>Omne Sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile est Finitum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. Now as Corporeal Quantity, which is Consistent, and hath Part beyond Part, is therefore Finite; So also Time, which is Successive and hath Part after Part, is also Finite. And though Part beyond Part may be Inverted, and the First become Last, or the Last First; or Circulated, and the Begining United to the End (and so every Consistent Quantity is Finite, becaus it hath such Parts) Yet Part after Part Succeed and follow one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a most direct Line, and by Such an Immutable Law and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as can neither be Inverted, nor Circulated: otherwise there should not be Part after Part; which must necessarily be in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Succession: for Past can never be Present, nor Present Future, nor all together. Wherefore Time cannot possibly be
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61550:16"/>
Circular: for in a Circle all the Parts must Consist together; as in Circular Motion all the Parts must Move together. Though probably the Opinion of the Eternity of the World was groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on some such Imaginary Circulation of Time, and Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Platonical Years. Whereas though all things measured by Time might be supposed to return again into the same State in all other respects, yet Time it self can never return to be the Same; becaus it is as Impossible to recall Past, as to anticipate Future. So that where there is such a fixed Priority and Posteriority runing still forward in a most Direct and Immutable Succession of Part after Part, which is Finite, there must necessarily be a Finite and Fixed First, or Begining; and Last, or End; according to the Fixed Order and Succession of the Parts. And as certein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as this Present Instant is now the Last or End of all Time Past, or Present, which hath hitherto Actualy Existed, or doth Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ist; so certeinly there was some determinate Instant, which was the first or Begining therof. And so this Conclusion also is most true and evident; <hi>Ubi Prius &amp; Posterius, ibi Primum et Postre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. Lastly as Bodys and Time, so Number or Quantity Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete, which hath Part Discreted and severed from Part, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so Finite in it self; and doth most Discernibly manifest the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Nature, both of Bodys, as in the Scale; and also of Time, as in the Dial: whereby their Continuous Parts being Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meticaly Divided into Numerable Proportions are rendred most apparently Numerable and Finite. And so also this Conclusion is most true and evident <hi>Nullum Multiplex est Innumerum.</hi> From all which Conclusions drawn from every kind of Quantity, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal, Successive, and Discrete, it most Necessarily follows, That whatsoever is Quantitative is Finite<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for it must be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the highest pain of Contradiction, That Actualy Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable cannot be Actualy Immense, nor Temporary Eternal, nor Numerable Innumerable.</p>
               <p n="4">IIII. Nor is this plain Probation concerned in those more Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Disquisitions, Whether Quantity be any Real thing in it self, or only a Mode, or Relative Respect (or I know not what others pleas to term it) Since it is most evidently the Geometrical,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61550:16"/>
Chronical, or Arithmetical, Measure of all Quantitative things, which are within the Virge therof, and Measurable by it. Nor of what Parts it doth Consist, or how it is Divisible into them; since it is most evident that it hath Parts. Nor yet whether any Whole Quantity hath Physical Parts; since it is most evident that it hath Mathematical Parts, and is Divisible into them. And though I shall heerafter inquire into all these, yet I will neither now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent my Self, nor intangle this Probation (which as it is most firm and solid in it self, so I desire to render it most clear and free from all Impertinencys) with any such Curiositys. Nor do I begg any therof before hand; but only insist upon these most reasonable and undeniable Postulations, That an Inch is the twelfth Part of a Foot, not more nor less; and a Foot twelve Inches, not more nor less. That an Hour is the fower and twentieth Part of a Day, not more nor less; and a Day fower and twenty Hours, not more nor less. That an Unit is the hundredth Part of a Century, not more nor less; and a Century an hundred Units, not more nor less. Or yet more plainly, That an Inch is an Inch, a Foot a Foot, an Hour an Hour, a Day a Day, an Unit an Unit, and a Century a Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury. And so any greater, or less, Part, or Whole whatsoever; which are all Identical Propositions, and neither need, nor are indeed capable of Probation. Nor are these Sections of Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuitys only Imaginations, or the Institutions of Reason; but Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litys in Nature. And so God Created the Heaven and the Earth distinct Parts of the whole Body of the World, and made the Evening and Morning a distinct Day, and consequently the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Numerations therof. And he made the Heaven to be above, or without, the Earth; and the Earth to be beneath, or within, the Heaven: and the First day to be before the Second, and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond before the Third; and consequently the Ordinal Numerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons therof. And heerin I suppose no Human Reason or Sens will or can dissent from Divine Authority; becaus these are things also Rationaly, and Sensibly, evident in themselvs: however some may doubt or dispute what I have evidently proved heerby, That there was a Begining of the World. Nor do I labor, or care to prove, when that determinate Begining was (which I leav to Chronologists) but only that there was such a Begining whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was, which sufficeth my present Intention.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:61550:17"/>V. For as in a great Wast or Common, though only the learned Artist can give an exact account of all the Acres, Rodes, and Perches therof; yet every Vulgar Ey can discern that it is Measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and Finite, and can estimate it more or less. And as every Traveler, though he hath not an Itinerary to instruct him in the just Distances between one City, or Country, and another, yet knows that there is a certein Space between them, otherwise such, and so many Paces, could never bring him from one to the other: so though it be the Work of Geometricians and Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers to measure Heaven and Earth; yet we all know that the Earth on which we tread hath a Surface, and a <hi>Diameter,</hi> which are Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite; because the Surface on which we tread doth end and termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate it self under our feet; and that doth also determinate the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter,</hi> which is Proportionable unto it: and because the <hi>Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> is Finite, therefore also the Circumference which must be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable therunto is Finite. And so is every Sphere of the World, Air, Aether, and any higher Heaven, or whatsoever we can Imagine to be the utmost Circumference of the whole World: for to whatsoever Circumference our Imagination can extend it self, it can only be Proportionably greater then the Circumference of the Earth, which it encompasseth; and must also have a <hi>Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> proportionable to it self: both which evidently prove it to be Finite, as well as the Earth; becaus there is no Greater nor Less in Infinite, as I have already proved.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. And so though we may dispute the Nativity, or certein Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining of the World; yet it is most evident and indisputable that it had a Begining: for none can deny it to be this Day, or Hour, or the like, one Day, or Hour, or the like, elder then it was the last; and so backward as far as he pleaseth: therefore he must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so confess, that there was some First Day, Hour, and the like, and consequently some First Instant, and Begining therof: for the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Age of every thing must necessarily be computed from a Begining or Nativity; otherwise it should be incapable of any Addition or Succession (which is apparently in all time) becaus it already exceedeth all Number: for Precedency of Part before Part without any Begining renders the Precedent Parts Innumerable, and consequently incapable of any Succession or Addition.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:61550:17"/>VII. So also in Number there must necessarily be a First, and no Number can precede an Unit; though you may still add to it, and possibly multiply it to any Summ Imaginable; which yet being once Stated will be found as Numerable as a Single Unit; becaus it is only the Addition of so many Units: for as a Day, or Hour, or any other Part of Time Actualy Past, is only a Day, or Hour, or such Part of Time as it is, and not greater, nor less; so every Day, or Hour, or other Part of Time whatsoever, is only One Day, or Hour, or One such Part of Time as it is, and not more, nor fewer: and therefore so many Days, or Hours, or other Parts of Time as are Actualy Past, are only so many Ones as they are, and not more, nor fewer; which though never so many must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily be all Numerable, by Addition of so many Ones as they are, and not more, nor fewer. And consequently all Time Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aly Past, which may be Numbred by them, is Numerable and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite: and therefore had a Begining; becaus the Number therof is Ordinal or Successive; wherof there must be a First. Thus if we should compute the whole Age of the World according to the particular Ages, or <hi>Secula,</hi> of Men or Brutes; or if you pleas according to the Revolutions of Platonical years; yet there must necessarily have been a First, Second, and Third <hi>Seculum,</hi> or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, or so many as we will suppose to have been Actualy Past and Precedent, and not more, nor fewer, nor other then Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive. All which summed up together will be found as Finite as a single Unit, and must have a First, and Last, aswel as One and One Ordinaly and Successively. Nor indeed can we Rationaly Imagin any Time whatsoever Actualy Past and Precedent, not to be Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aly Finite. And if it cannot be otherwise in Imagination, much less in Reality.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Yet the World might Possibly have Existed before it did Exist, or Actualy was; and as long before as you pleas to Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin; and so it may still be continued Perpetualy in Possibility; which yet will be alway Possible, and can never be Actual: for no such Precedent, or Subsequent Perpetuity, ever was, or shall be, nor can reasonably be Imagined to be Actual. Neither is it properly a Possible Perpetuity, but rather a Perpetual Possibili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61550:18"/>
can never be Actual; otherwise it should not be Perpetualy Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible: for as Possible, while it is Possible, cannot be Actual; otherwise it should not be Possible, but Actual: so Perpetualy Possible can never be Actual; becaus then it should ceas to be Perpetualy Possible. As it is said of Corporeal Quantity, that it is alway Divisible into alway Divisibles; ever Possibly, but never Actualy: becaus if it should once be Actualy Divided into all its Divisibles, then it should ceas to be alway Divisible (which is a most true and evident Ratiocination, supposing such a Perpetual Divisibility therof, wherof I shall heerafter discours) But no Possibility whatsoever, either Precedent, or Subsequent, doth mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate against this present Discours concerning the Actual Existence of the World.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. This Perpetual Possibility in Futurity is the Duration of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Spirits; which though it may not seem to be the same with Time in a restrained sens (as Time may be distinguished from Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration) yet is the same with it in a general sens. And so the Soul of Man, both in this Mortal Life, and also in his Immortal Life heerafter, shall continue to be under the same Duration; though his Time may be restrained to this Mortal Life, which hath an End, and is computed according to the Chronology of the Hours, Days, and Years therof: and so we commonly distinguish between Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, and Eternal or Everlasting. Thus <hi>Plato</hi> makes all Time to be the Measure of Duration according to the Motion of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Bodys, which divide it into such Parts or Sections therof: and therupon, I suppose, grounded his Opinion of the Circular Revolutions of Time, like the Circular Motions of the Heavens. But as Duration was Coetaneous with the first <hi>Chaos</hi> (for there was an Evening before any Morning, or Illumination of the Aether; and three several Days before the Sun and Stars) so the same Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration shall continue when they shall be dissolved, and when Time, in that sens, shall be no more. And yet in all the Perpetual Possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of this Duration, so farr as it shall ever heerafter become Actual, it shall likewise be Actualy Finite, as I have already proved. Wheras Proper Eternity is neither in any Precedent, nor Subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Possibility; but always Actual, and alway Present, or one Perpetual Instant: which is Divine, Infinite, and Incomprehensible, and of another nature, Infinitely and Incomprehensibly Different

               <p n="10">X. Wherfore I Conclude upon the whole precedent matter, That every Quantity, that hath Existed or doth Actualy Exist, is Actualy Finite. And so is every Quantitative thing measured thereby. And that no Imagination, nor Possibility it Self, can make it to be otherwise. Because all Quantity and Quantitative things have Parts, and all Parts are Finite, and therefore whatsoever hath Parts is Finite, and whatsoever is Finite, is Terminated or bounded with Extremitys, or First, or Begining; and Last, or End; Respectively ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Parts: otherwise it should not be Finite. And particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, that time and Duration (which is Successive) and all Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary and Durable things, had a Realy Precedent and fixed First or Begining. Now that the force of this most Cogent Argument may not be lost or spent in so large a Dilatation, I will briefly Summ it up in these few and short Propositions, which I shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to any Man of Reason most strictly to examin, and consider whether he can deny any one of them, or the Consequence of them all, without forfeiture of his Rationality.</p>

Thus Infinite doth Transcend Finite, not Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely, by any Parts, or Degrees whatsoever; but Infinitely, according to its own Nature, which is Infinite. Wherefore also Finite cannot be any the least Part, or Degree of Infinite; for then the Whole also should be Finite. And Infinite doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Infinitely Transcend Finite; but is also Infinitely Different from it, without any Part, or Degree of Difference. And so though it doth Comprehend all Finites (as we say, Infinite Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doth Comprehend all Finite Beings, Infinite Immensity all Finite Bodys, Infinite Eternity all Finite Time, and Infinite Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty all Finite Numbers) Yet it doth also Comprehend them Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely, according to its own Infinite Nature, that is, Incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensibly as to our Finite Understanding; and Inconfusedly as to the Finite Nature of the Things themselvs: and so God is the only true Transcendent and Eminent Caus neither Confounded, nor Compounded with them; nor such as doth Contradict, Alter, or Interfere with them, in any kind or maner whatsoever. And wheras Infinite and Finite do thus Consist together, and yet In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely Differ, we must alway reserv the Notions therof under most Different and Distinct Considerations, and not Confound them one with another in our Understandings, which are not Confounded in themselves; otherwise we shall thereby also Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found our own Understandings, and disturb any right Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, either of Infinite, or Finite. Thus is Infinite both the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Affirmation of all Being, and Welbeing; and the Infinite Negation of all Notbeing, and Ilbeing: which Negation being double, is only the Infinite Affirmation of it self.</p>
               <p n="3">III. As Infinite is Infinitely Affirmative, so Absolute Nothing is Not-finitely Negative, or the Notfinite Negation of all that

is Affirmative. And any Affirmation of it self, as that Nonentity is Nonentity, and the like, is only the Notfinite Negation of it self.

                  </gap>n Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Predication of Himself, or That God is God, for <hi>Quicquid est in Deo est Deus.</hi> And yet as he is Infinitely All, and the Transcendency of all Finite Perfections which are many and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral; so there is Improperly Infinite, which may Improperly be Predicated of him severally according to our Finite Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and his Infinite Condescension thereunto. And such are all those Partial and Distinguishing Notions which we frame of him. As that he is Entity, Immensity, Eternity, Unity, and the like: Whereby we render that which is Infinite, and Infinitely One in Himself, and with Himself, Partial, and Several, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently Improperly Infinite; but not Properly Finite: for though thereby we render that which is Infinitely One in Himself, Many in our Understanding; Yet we also acknowledg him to be Infinite Entity, Infinite Immensity, Infinite Eternity, and Infinite Unity, and not More, or Less. Again more Improperly Infinite is that which is Properly Finite in it self, but Improperly Infinite in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of God who is Infinite; as Sin (which is committed against him) is therefore by Divines said to be Infinite: and so indeed is every Creature in respect of him, who is the Infinite Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Caus, and Being of the Being therof. But most Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Infinite are such things as are only Indefinite unto us, or exceed our Finite Understanding. So we say that the Globe of Heaven and Earth which is Finite in it self, is Immens, and the World Eternal, and the Dust of the Earth Innumerable, and the

to examin and refute the Grand Argument against the Possibility therof, <hi>Ex Nihilo Nihil fit.</hi> Absolute Impossibility is that which no Power can Possibly reduce into Act or Actual Being; Wherefore whatsoever may be so reduced is Possible to Infinite Power, which should not be Infinite, if any Affirmative Act should be Impossible unto it: for then it should be Limited by Somthing Possible which it cannot Act, and consequently be Finite. Thus Infinite Power must Necessarily be Omnipote<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t or able to Act all things, except Contradictions, which are only the Negati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it self, and consequently infer a Notfinite Impotence. And not to be able to Act such Negations is a double Negation; which as I have said, is only the Affirmation of it self. So God cannot Contradict Himself; either in Essence, as not to be God, or not to be Infinite, which is the same; or in Operation, as to make the same Thing to Be and Not be Absolutely; for then he should undo what he doth. And so God cannot make Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Nothing or Notbeing to Be; for then it should Be and Not be Absolutely, which is an Absolute Contradiction. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can he Convert Absolute Nothing into Somthing, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract Somthing out of Absolute Nothing; for then it should not be Absolute Nothing, out of which there is Nothing which may be so Converted, Extracted, or Made, in any kind or maner whatsoever.</p>
               <p n="2">II. So that if to Create were any of these Operations, as the Objection doth import, then it should be confessedly Impossible. And I suppose some such Misapprehension hath been the ground of that Error. Wheras Creation rightly understood is only a Causing Finite Being to be from Absolute Notbeing, as the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Term, from which it doth Commence; and not of which or out of which it is Made in any kind or maner whatsoever. Now becaus Absolute Nothing or Notbeing is only a Negative Term or pure Negation, it can neither resist Creation, nor contribute any thing to, or toward it; becaus it is Absolute Nothing.</p>
               <p n="3">III. And becaus Absolute Nothing cannot resist in the least, therefore Creation is Infinitely Possible to Infinite Power; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is Nothing to resist it. And also becaus whatsoever
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61550:21"/>
is Possible to Infinite Power, is Infinitely Possible to it; and not Partialy, or Gradualy; becaus Infinite hath no Parts, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. Nor doth the Creation of Finite Being Contradict, or Alter, Augment, or Diminish, Infinite Being, or Notfinite Not being. And so the present Finite Being which is Created (as we have already shewed) doth not Contradict, Alter, Augment or D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>minish, either of them, which are Eternaly the same in themselvs.</p>
               <p n="4">IIII. But because Absolute Notbeing cannot contribute any thing to, or toward, Creation, therefore it is Impossible to any Finite Power: for Absolute Nothing doth afford no Matter, Principle Preparation, Inclination, Capacity, or any Somthing whatsoever; wherupon, or whereby, Finite Power may begin to work; and where there is no Begining, there cannot Possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be any Progress, or Perfection therof by any Finite Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; but only by Infinite Power, which can Create Being, and the very Begining therof from Absolute Notbeing. Also all Finite Power it self before it was Created was absolutely Null; and so had no Power in it Self to Create it self, or any other Being, from Absolute Notbeing. Nor could God himself De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legate this Infinite Power to Angels or <hi>Daemons,</hi> or any Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binical or Platonical Subcreators; which must be either To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly, or Partialy, not Totaly; for then God should ceas to have or be Infinite Power in Himself, and consequently to be God; which is an Infinite Contradiction, nor Partialy; for Infinite hath no Parts. Certeinly no Angel, nor Man, the chief of Natural Operators, did ever arrogate unto himself a Creating Power. Nor have we any Instances of Creation in the whole History of Nature, among all those Monstrous Relations, which the Writers therof have inserted. Nor hath any Poetical Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy ever Invented or Imagined a <hi>Metamorphosis</hi> of Being from Notbeing. Much less hath any Philosophy ascribed this Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Power to Nature her self; but rather denieth a Creation; and yet to solv it, is forced to substitute an Impossible Eternity of Finite Nature; and certein Fictitious Powers, Eminences, and Equivocal Causalitys, which I shall also examin heeraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:61550:22"/>V. As Creation is a Causing to be from Notbeing, so Annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is a Causing Not to be from Being; which is most Possible to the Infinite Creator; becaus it is only the withdrawing his own Infinite Power, whereby he doth continualy Caus the Creature to Be; but Impossible to any Finite Power; becaus it cannot resist the Infinite Creating Power, which doth so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinualy Cause the Creature to Be. And as there can be no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation by any Finite Power; So we never read of any by Infinite Power: Nor probably will God ever Annihilate any thing which he hath Immediately Created; for he doth nothing in vain, but continueth and reserveth all things, which he hath made by Proper Creation, for his own Everlasting Glory.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Thus to Caus to Be or Continue to Be from Absolute Notbeing is Proper Creation. But there are also Improper Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, which do not produce or preserv any Being from Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Notbeing: but only alter the Created Being in such a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural maner as is beyond all Natural Generation, or any other Natural Power of the Creature: which being Finite, and no more then it is; as it cannot Create without Infinite Power, which it hath not; so neither can it Act any thing beyond that Finite Power which it hath. And thus, though it is the Opinion of Divines that God Originaly Created nothing after the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, except Souls of Men (or Angels if they were not Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naly Created in and with their Heaven) by Proper Creation; Yet God is said to Create in all the Six days, and expressly in the Fifth day to Create great Whales (though it be also said that the Waters Produced them aswell as others) by Improper Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was his Immediate Ordination of the whole Frame and Cours of Nature, and Original Generation of them all: which the several Creatures in their First <hi>Chaos</hi> (before their Active Qualitys and Mist Forms were Produced, and all other previous and requisite Matters Powers and Instruments were prepared and adapted by God) could not perform in or by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs, nor Generate others, untill they were so fitted and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed, and the Divine Blessing of Multiplication added ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, as I shall shew heerafter: and therefore all those Works of the Six Days, which did Succeed the Original and Proper

Matter was Created afterward. Nor was it Created in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Begining only Matter, or one Homogeneous Mass therof; but one Body, expressly distinguished into several Heterogeneous Members, Celestial, and Terrestrial; or Heaven, and Earth. Nor was the Heaven and Earth thus only Different in Nature, in their First Creation, but also Distinct and separate in their Situations, and not Confounded together, but Created such several Members of the great Body of the World. And as the Heaven is named before the Earth, so were the Celestial Bodys above or without the Terrestrial, incompassing them as now they do: for neither do we read, nor can we reasonably suppose, that there was any other Separation or Disposition of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial Bodys afterward; as is expresly mentioned of the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial, or Terraqueous Globe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of all their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Situations, I shall further discours heerafter.</p>

                  </gap>caly is Heavens, not only Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticaly (as the word God in this Text) but Phisicaly, and in the nature of the thing it self. And so generaly the Hebrews di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribute Heaven into three several Heavens of three several Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Wherof the highest is also called the Third Heaven; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus it is Utmost and the last above us, and encompasseth both the others; and this I shall therefore call the Superaether. The midst, or Second, is the Aether, or Starry Heaven. The lowest or First, is the Air which Immediately encompasseth the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raqueous Globe. And these are all the Celestial Spheres wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we read, and therefore I can acknowledg no more however Astronomers have pleased to multiply them. These three Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens are thus built one upon another, and all upon the Terra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queous Globe, which is the Habitation of all Corporeal <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals</hi>: as <hi>Amos</hi> elegantly expresseth it, <hi>He that builded the Storys of the Heavens, and founded his Troop on the Earth.</hi> Of all the three Heavens the Third, which is the Supreme, is most Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Heaven; and therefore also is called the Heaven of Heavens, by way of Excellency, and so is specialy called the Temple of the most high God; and is the Native Region and Province of Blessed Angels, or <hi>Caelum Angelicum</hi>; and shall be the Everlasting Habitation of the Spirits of Just Men, or <hi>Sedes Beatorum.</hi> Wherof we have no farther discover<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>der one Common Name with them: and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably because it was made Perfect in the Begining or first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant of the Creation therof, and so must continue for ever, without any Elementary Mistion, Generation, or Corruption; therefore we have no other account therof among all the Works of the Six Days; wherein the Elements, and whole Element<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tary Nature, and the Cours of Generation, and Corrupti on therin, was Set in order. And accordingly I observ, that wheras the other two Elementary Heavens, Aether, and Air, are called <hi>Expansa</hi> and Firmaments, this Superaether is never so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; but only Heaven, probably becaus it is not capable of Expansion or Compression. But as the Divine Wisedom hath conceled any farther notice therof, and also given us very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Knowledg of the nature of Angels, the proper Inhabitants therof, as Impertinent for us to know in this present State; so I shall not presume farther to inquire therinto, or discours ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: and indeed if the Hebraical Word Heavens be dualy ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, it must be intended only of Aether, and Air.</p>
               <p n="3">III. As the Aether and Air are Elementary, and both of them He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>erogeneous from the Superaether, and every of them one from another; So are all of them from the Earth, and Terra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queous Globe. And as Heaven generaly Comprehendeth all the three Heavens, so heer also Earth Comprehendeth both Earth, and Water; which were afterward formed into one Terraqueous Globe: and by that general Name in this Text is not only to be Understood Earth particularly (which was not so termed untill the Third Day, and then also is called Dry Land) nor the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raqueous Globe such as it was made afterward; but the Orb of Earth and the Water above it, which is also mentioned after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Thus we have a Discovery of what was Created in the Begining; that is, Superaether, which is also Superelementary and Aether, Air, Water, Earth, which are the fower Elements; as God the Creator hath declared, and <hi>Moses</hi> reveled them unto us, both in this Text, and in the Context, whom I shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev before all <hi>Athens,</hi> or any Modern Conceptions whatsoever; and shall accordingly prove them heerafter. And now upon this Subject Matter proceed to discours; and first enter upon such
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61550:24"/>
Philosophical Consyderations therof as may concern them all, and all Creatures Generaly; and so according to the order of this History of the Creation Expatiate into more Particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations of their several Natures afterward. The first and most Universal Consyderation of Heaven and Earth, and of all Creatures whatsoever, is that they are Entitys; for since Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is of Being from Absolute Nothing, whatsoever is Created must necessarily Be; otherwise it should not be Created. So that an Entity is any Thing that Is, which I confess, is no more in effect, then that an Entity is Entity: whose Subject and Praejudicate, <hi>Genu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> and Difference, is, and must necessarily be the same; becaus it is the same <hi>Genus Generalissimum</hi> of all Things without any Specifical Difference. And heer I must also premise that in every Perfect and Proper Definition of any Specifical, or more Particular Thing, the Specifical or particular Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences therof must be Identical; becaus the Specifical or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Essence or Entity is the only true Specifical or Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Difference of every thing. But becaus we cannot know Essences as they are in themselvs, therefore we declare things by their Propertys, which is rather Description then Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As in the Common Instance, <hi>Homo est Animal Rationale,</hi> Rationality is not the true Specifical Difference of Humanity, though it be most Proper to Man; becaus it is not his Specifical Essence; and therefore doth not Define the Humanity it self. Nor doth it indeed Comprehend all the Properties therof, as Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility, and the like; but only Describe it by one Proper Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. So that the most Proper Definitions are only Vocabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larys and Nomenclatures, which yet are of good use to explain one Term by another; whereby we may avoid all needless Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Contention about Terms, and when the Thing inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thereby is clearly understood, it shall suffice me. And I have now made this Digressive <hi>Parenthesis,</hi> to save my Self the whole labor of Defining, and the expectation of any who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise perhaps might exact it of me: but I shall use as clear and pregnant Declarations or Descriptions as the Thing will afford. Thus I affirm Created Entity to be a Creature, or whatsoever is Created which is also Convertible with it. Again becaus the Created World doth Consist of several Heterogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and different Entitys and Natures (into which Differences
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61550:24"/>
we must also inquire) I affirm such a Different Entity to be whatsoever God hath Created Different in Nature from another: for as whatsoever he hath Created must Necessarily Be; so what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he hath Created Different must necessarily Differ. Now heer we must Consyder a Difference which Scholemen have made of Entity it Self; which is, that it is either Entity Real, or Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Reason: Entity Real is in the Thing it Self and Nature ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; as Heaven, and Earth, and all things therin; Entity of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is in our Reason or Mind; as the whole Poetical World, and all things therin; Hircocervs, Hippocentaurs, and the like; which are therefore also called Entitys; becaus our very Imaginations and Fictions therof are Creatures, and Entitative, though the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Figments themselvs are as it were our Creatures, and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively Nothings. And so also there are Entitys of Sens, as all Deceptions of the Senses: for though there be no such Objects, yet there is Realy and truly such a Sensation, as well as when the Objects are Real and true, as I shall shew heerafter. Now as Entitys Real and of Reason are both Entitative, So there is such a Diversity of Entity it Self, Respectively, and Improperly: But as Entitys of Reason are Objectively Nonentitative, So also there is Absolutely and Properly no Difference, but a plain Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction between them, and Real Entity; as a Number, and a Null or <hi>Cyphar,</hi> do not Properly Differ, but Contradict one another becaus one is, and the other is not. Wherefore all Real and true Difference must be between things that are truly Real; and again whatsoever things are Real may Realy Differ from others in the Things themselvs and Natures therof. So that Real Difference is not only Corporeal, or of things wherof there is or may be a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Separation, but also of any other Thing or Entity, though not Separated or Separable Localy: for though Entity it self be only Generical, yet there are also Specifical and Particular Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences, and Differences. Thus an Angel in a Body, and the Body, are Realy Different Specificaly in the Things themselvs, and Natures therof; though not Localy Separated, yet as truly as when they are Localy Separated. So that their Difference is not only from their several Localitys, but from their several Specifical Natures. So also the Soul, and Body of Man, are now Different, though not yet Separated, but only Separable by
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61550:25"/>
Death; and shall be Different after the Resurrection, when they shall be Inseparable, as well as after Death and before the Resurrection, when they shall be Localy Separated: and So Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and Earth, also Differ, not only becaus they are Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aly Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, but also becaus they are Heaven, and Earth; that is, Several Natures Specificaly Different. Also there may be an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Difference where there is no Specifical Difference, as in a Legion of Angels, or Men; Lastly there is a Numerical Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference where there is no Individual Difference; as all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a Body are so many as they are Numericaly, but yet do not Differ Individualy: otherwise it should not be one Body, or Individual Composition therof, but so many several Individuals, as there are Members. But whatsoever doth Differ in any other kind, doth also Differ Numericaly; becaus Number, or Quantity Discrete, is Comprehensive of all Differences, Diversitys, or Discretions whatsoever. And now I shall Conclude that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God hath Created, and is in Nature and Not only in our Reason or Mind, Realy is: and whatsoever God hath Created Different, and doth Differ in Nature, and not only in our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or Mind, is Realy Different: which I suppose None can De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and according to these Undeniable Rules I shall proceed.</p>
               <p n="6">VI, The first Real Difference of Entity is that it is either Substance, or Accident. And now (becaus I know I must fight out my way by Inches against all Sceptical Disputers) I shall proceed as clearly and firmly as I can. And first I shall explain my Terms. By Substance I intend an Entity Naturaly Subsisting in it Self, and from which other Accidental Entitys do Naturaly Flow, and Subsist therin. By Accident I intend an Entity which doth Naturaly Flow from and Subsist in a Substance. So that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance is both the Original Fountain, and Continual Foundation of any Accident, <hi>Cujus Esse est Inesse,</hi> which some cavill against, becaus they do not Understand it; though it is very true, and rightly said of an Accident, that it is the Accident of a Substance and in respect of the Substance: as it may be also said of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in respect of Accidents, <hi>Cujus Esse est Subesse.</hi> But as all particular Substances, Matter, and Forms, have their own Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical Essences or Entitys, So also have all particular Accidents
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61550:25"/>
Extension, Figure, Density, Gravity, Motion, Heat, Light, and the rest. Also though all Accidents do Originaly Subsist in their Substances; yet Derivatively one Accident may Subsist in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as Figure in Extension, Gravity in Density; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Several Accidents may Subsist Immediately in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. And one Accident doth so Subsist in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> if it be a particular Product, Property, or Affection therof; as Figure is of Extension, or Gravity of Density, and the like. Now Accidents are therefore so called; becaus they are Adventitious to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, wherof the Specifical Essence, as I have said, is in it Self, and doth not consist in any, or all the Accidents therof; nor is, or can be Altered, or made More or Less, by the Variations ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and also becaus Accidents in themselvs do sometimes Actualy Exist, Appear, and Exert their Operations; and sometimes only Subsist Potentialy, and are Latent and Quiescent in their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances: as may evidently appear by all the several Variations of Accidents, the Substance remaining the same; becaus it doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Subsist in it Self; and therfore always is Actualy what it is in it Self: for if it should be Potential, then the Potentiality therof not Actualy Subsisting in it Self, should Subsist in another; and Consequently be an Accident, and not a Substance. And thus every Entity which is Created, and cannot be Annihilated, must necessarily alway Subsist either in it Self, or in another Actualy, or Potentialy; But becaus Accidents Affect, and indeed Perfect the Substance, therefore they are also called Affections; Now that there are Substances, I Suppose, none will Deny who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg any Actual Entitys: and that there are Accidents, none can deny who hath the use of his Senses; wherof all Sensible Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents are the Proper Objects: and Objects of Intellect are only understood by Objects of Sens. So that indeed all our Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is Immediately with and by Accidents; and we neither know Essences of Accidents, nor Substances, otherwise then by their Actual <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> or Appearances: Nor can Substances Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate any thing without the Actual Operations, of Accidents. Wher efore that I may not fight as beating the Air, nor Contend for that which will and must be yielded, I shall more directly
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61550:26"/>
oppugn that wherin I conceiv the greatest strength of opposition to ly, and accordingly address my Self to prove that Accidents are Realy Different from their Substances: whereby I shall also prove that both Substances and Accidents Realy are; becaus any Real Difference is only between Real Entitys. Now as I have said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God in the Begining Created Heaven and Earth, and all other their Primitive Entitys therin, which yet did not then all Actualy Exist, Appear, and Operate: for it is said expresly, that there was yet no Light in the Heaven, but Darkness was upon the face of the Deep; and of the Earth that it was without form and void: and if they had been otherwise Created in the Begining, all the ensuing Works of God in the Six Days had been needless and Superfluous. Wheras Elementary Substances and the Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their Accidents in their Potentialitys being Created toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Begining, the work of the Three first Days was to Produce their Accidents out of Potentiality into Act; as I shall particularly shew heerafter. And though this was not Properly Creation of any New Entity from Nonentity; yet as it was the Production of the Actualitys of the Accidents, and not of the Substance<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of the Elements, it plainly Discovers a Real Difference between Substances, and Accidents. Certeinly as it was the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Several Actualitys therof in several Days, it declares the Accidents so severaly Actuated to be several and Different in themselvs; and much more all of them to be Different from the Substances, from which they all Differ more Genericaly, and consequently more then one from another. Again if Substances and Accidents did not Realy Differ, then no Accidents of the same Substance should Realy Differ one from another, but all should be one and the same with themselvs, as well as with their Substance: For as the Mathematical Rule is most true, That if each of two Lines be Equal to a third, one of them must necessarily be Equal to the other. So if each of two Entitys, could be one and the same with a third, the one must Necessarily be one and the same with the other: and so if Extension, Figure, Density, Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, Motion, Heat, Light, and the rest, and all the Several Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations therof, were one and the same with the Aethereal Substance, then they must also be one and the same in themselvs: Yea if they were only Accidents of the Matter, as some affirm all Contrary
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61550:26"/>
Qualitys, Heat and Cold, and the rest must be one and the same with the Matter; which is most Absurd and Irrational: for then Heat should be Cold, and Cold Heat, and the like. Also if we Consyder the Continual Sensible Variations of Accidents, and their Productions out of Potentiality into Actuality, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions from Actuality to Potentiality, whereby they so often Appear and Disappear unto us, and their Desultory and Exile Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (which to some scarcely seems to be Real) we may not Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin them to be Realy the same with their Substances, which Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in themselvs, and are Fixed, Solid, and Substantial Entitys; and therefore always are Actual, and never Potential, as I shall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly shew heerafter in all the ensuing Discourses. Wherefore I Conclude that Since there are such Substantial, and Acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Entitys, and that they Differ one from another, in Nature, and not only in our Mind and Reason; that they both Realy are; and that Accidents Realy Differ from Substances, and also one from another.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Substance is either Matter, or Forms; (for I must use that Common Term untill I can substitute another) And becaus, as I have said, we know Substances only Intelligibly, by their Sensible Accidents, I shall accordingly by them declare what I intend by Matter, and what by Forms, Matter is known by Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Quantity, which is the Proper Accident therof. And this Quantity is either Extension, and the Products or Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys therof, Figure, Porosity, and the like; or Density and the Products or Propertys therof, Gravity, Corporeal Motion, and the like. Also Matter hath a Common Receptivity of Forms, and is Passively apt to be Consubstantiated with them, and is as the Body therof, being in it Self one Homogeneous and Uniform <hi>Moles,</hi> or Mass; and is also the Passive Subject of all its own Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Variations, which are Superinduced in it by the various Activitys of Forms. Whence it is rightly called <hi>Materia,</hi> which the Forms, as Architects, do severaly Mold and Fashion into fit Bodys for themselvs. And therefore I Describe Matter to be One Passive Substantial Entity or Common Body of Forms. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain Forms are known by their Qualitys, which are Generaly Active, as Heat, Cold, Moisture, Drines, and the like; and are
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61550:27"/>
not only Various, and Innumerable to us, but also many of them Contrary one to another: whereby I know their Substantial Forms also to be Several, Heterogeneous, and Difform: wherof some are apt to Consubstantiate themselvs Subordinately with the Passive Matter, which they as Spirits, do Actively Inform or InSpirit, as all Inferior Forms or Spirits; and some do not Consubstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate but only Inform it; as the Human Spirit; and some neither Consubstantiate nor Inform it, as Angels: and though all Exist in it, yet none Subsist in it, as Accidents do in Substances; And so these Forms are Several Active Substantial Entitys or Spirits. And I shall henceforth generally call them Spirits; Wherby I do not intend Spirit Grammaticaly, that is Breath; nor yet with Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, and others, those Igneous Aereous, Aqueous, and Terreous, Natural, Vital, or Animal Spirits, which indeed are only such Qualitys of the Elementary Spirits; but Substantial Spirits Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct or Different from the Matter, as I have before discoursed them. And so there are not only Angelical Spirits which Exist Separate from the Matter Naturaly, though in it Localy, and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Spirits which are also Immaterial, and such as may so Exist se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately, as well as Angelical, and yet are apt to Inform or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Spirit the Human Body wherwith they are Composited, But also Material Spirit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, which cannot so Exist Separately, or as Separate Substances without the Matter, and therefore are called Material, though they are in themselvs neither Matter nor Homogeneous with the Matter as I shall shew heerafter. And so the Wiseman mentioneth <hi>The Spirit of a Beast that goeth downward to the Earth,</hi> as well as <hi>the Spirit of Man that goeth upward.</hi> And so also there are Vegetative Spirits, and the Spirit of the Heaven (as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of <hi>Esdras</hi> saith of the Firmament) and of all the Elements, (which are more Properly Material becaus they Immediately Consubstantiate Matter) that is, such Active Substantial Entitys, as I have before Described. And there are also Accidental Spirits or Spiritual Activitys Powers, and Virtues mentioned in Scripture. Which yet are no Substantial Spirits, but Subsist in them. And I suppose this general Name Spirit doth better express all simple Substantial Activitys (which were Immediately Created by God, as well as Matter, and can never be Annihilated or Altered as they are in themselvs, any more then Matter it Self) then Forms
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61550:27"/>

Having thus explained my Terms, I shall proceed (as before concerning Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances and Accidents) to prove that Matter and these simple Created Spirits Realy Differ, whereby I shall also prove that there Realy are both such Matter and Such Spirits. And wheras it is now generaly granted that there are such Angelical and Human Spirits Realy Different from Matter (for which, I suppose, we may thank Christianity) I shall accept i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; and apply my Self only to prove the same of the rest; and then I presume no Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then can deny it of the others. Now in our present History of the Creation it is said that the Water brought forth Fishes after their Kinds, and Fowls after their Kinds, and the Earth Beasts after their Kinds, and Creeping things after their Kinds. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appears that these Creatures were of Several Kinds, and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogeneous one from another, and Consequently all of them from the Matter; which being one Homogeneous Substance in it Self can never Produce any Heterogeneous Substances; and therefore all this Heterogeneity must necessarily be from some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Substantial Principles; that is, their Spirits: which were Created thus Specificaly Heterogeneous one from another, and all of them more Genericaly Heterogeneous from the Common Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And so it is also expresly said concerning Vegetatives; and must be reasonably understood of Heaven, and Earth, and all the Elements: for the Matter of them all being one and the same could not Constitute and Denominate them Heaven, or Earth, neither could they be so Denominated from their own Proper
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61550:28"/>
Qualitys, which were not yet Actualy Produced, but afterward in the Three first Days. Wherfore there were such several He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogeneous Substantial Principles (which I call Elementary Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits) Created in the Begining and then Actualy Subsisting in and with the Matter, which did so Denominate the Heaven and Earth, and the rest. And if they together with the Matter could not Produce their own Proper Qualitys, without such a Supernatural, though Improper Creation; much less could the Matter of it Self Produce any Such Substantial Spirits, and Activitys, farr more excellent then it Self. Again if Accidents of the same Substance being Several must therefore Realy Differ from the Substance, as I have before proved, then certeinly Accidents of Several Substances, which are not only Several, but also Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, do necessarily prove that they can not proceed from one and the same Substantial Principle, such as Matter is: for then the same Nature should destroy it self by its own Natural Contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etys. And though in Mist Bodys which are Composed of all the Elements there be the Substantial Principles of Contrary Qualitys, Heat, Cold, Moisture, Driness, and the like Mist and Contemperated together, or though the same thing may Produce Contrary Effects in Several Subjects, as Motion may excite Heat in Fire and Cold in Air, or the same Faculty may exercise Contrary Actions toward Contrary Objects; as the Will or Appetite doth Affect that which is Pleasant, and Disaffect that which is Displeasant; Yet Matter, which is one and the same, cannot Produce Contrary Activitys, and Exercise Contrary Operations in it Self, which destroy one another, and so consequently should Corrupt it self by such Contrary Qualitys. Wherefore all Generation and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and all <hi>Menstrua,</hi> and the like, do plainly prove that there are Several Substantial Principles of Such Contrary Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litys, not only Realy Different from the Matter, but also Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form one from another. And therefore, unless we affirm Heat, Cold, Moisture, Driness, and all other Contrary Qualitys, and Consequently Ae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61550:28"/>
Principles therof, Different one from another, and consequently all from the Matter. And this may appear most clearly by many Sensible Distinctions and Differences between them, which I shall now only generaly mention, and heerafter more particularly discover in the ensuing Discourses. As that Matter hath <hi>Pondus,</hi> and the Products therof which Spirits have not: but there are Active <hi>Potentiae</hi> of Spirits and all the various Operations and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects therof, which Matter hath not: And the <hi>Pondus</hi> of Matter tendeth from the Circumference to the Center, but the <hi>Potentia</hi> of Spirits from the Center to the Circumference. And Matter being only one Homogeneous Body hath only one Center; but Spirits being Many and Several have every one of them in their <hi>Composita</hi> a several Center. Also all Matter is Continuous; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus it is one Homogeneous Body; but the Contiguity of several Bodys is only from the several Spirits. Also Matter tendeth Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaly to Rest, but Spirits intend their Acts and Exercises to the Utmost. Also Matter hath only Different Degrees of More or Less; but Spirits have their Actively Contrary Qualitys, and the like. Now though I cannot Sensibly Produce and Present such a <hi>Genius</hi> of things or Spirit, as it is in it Self; not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus it is a Spirit, but also becaus it is a Substance; which as I have said that it is only Intelligible (as none can discover Pure Matter, or <hi>Materia prima,</hi> as it is in it Self, but both may be discerned by their Sensible Accidents, wherof the Accidents of Spirits, which are Proper Sensibles, are more Sensible then of Matter, which are only common Sensibles and Sensed by the others) so I have proved Matter and Spirits by their Different Accidents to be several Substantial Principles, and Realy Different one from another. And though none can affirm that there is any Matter Separate from Spirits; yet it is granted that there are Spirits Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from Matter, as Angels. Nor may it seem strange that two such Substances should be Consubstantiated into one, since there is no Matter without some Spirit to Diversify it; and it is also granted that there is a Spirit of Man which doth Inform or Inspirit his Body; and not only Possess it as an Angel. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore certeinly Material Spirits which are Connatural may also Consubstantiate the Matter. And we must understand that as all Created Entitys are Creatures, or Created by God; so they are
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61550:29"/>
United into one <hi>Genus</hi> of their Common Entity; which though it be Metaphysical, yet it is not only a Notional, but a Real Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality of them all; whereby they are so Realy United and accordingly have some Physical Communion one with another, and all Conspire together against Nonentity. And so Matter and Spirits though very Different Entitys; yet because they are all Entitys, either Consubstantiate one another, as all Material Spirits, which cannot be Separate, nor Exert or Exercise their Qualitys or Operations without the Instrumentality of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Bodys, or otherwise Inform and Inspirit them, as the Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Spirit of Man: which may be Separate, or not Separate from the Body therof, and Exert and Exercise some Qualitys and Operations by the Instrumentality therof, and some without it, as I shall shew heerafter; or at least as Angels, who though they be purely Immaterial Spirits, and have no such Consubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial nor Compositive Union with the Matter, nor do Inform or Inspirit it, nor Operate by any Instrumentality therof; but are in that respect wholy Separate from it, yet have this Communion with it, that they are Localy in it, where they are and do Move from one Part or Place therof to another, and more or less sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly and easily, and can not Move beyond the Universal Body therof; for then they might Wander in Notfinite and Endless Inanity, which as I have said is Pure Nonentity. And though Extension and Local Motion be Properly of the Matter, yet Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Spirits by their Conjunct State and Consubstantiation are Coextended with it, and all others are Conteined in it, and in this or that Part therof, and Move from this or that Place therof, according to the several Spheres of their own Substantial Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitys; whether they be more United unto it by a Conjunct Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation, as Material Spirits; which are in the Matter like Inherent Light in the Lucid Body, and in so much therof as it doth Inherently Illuminate, or less and without any such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct Consubstantiation, as the Human Spirit, which is in the Matter as Light in the Diaphanous Air which it requires to Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate; or otherwise as Angels, which are in it as Magnetical Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations in any <hi>Medium.</hi> And accordingly Material Spirits are most Powerful in their Center, but Immaterial Intirely Equal in their whole Sphere. Now wheras some affirm that Substantial
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61550:29"/>
Spirits, and all their Spiritual Qualitys, are only Various Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Matter; I shall according to my maner first endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to Understand, what is or may be Intended by the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Matter; which certeinly can not be any Substantial Activity in it Self Distinct from the Matter; for then we might agree in the Thing, and should not differ about Terms: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Motion of the Matter must be only an Accidental Affection therof, (like Extension and the rest whereby matter Extends it Self) and so in Effect Motion of the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tter is only Matter Moving it Self; Wheras it Naturaly tends to Rest, and Moves only in order therunto, as I shall shew heerafter; and this Moving must be only Local, becaus it is of the Matter from one Part or Place therof to another. But as I have shewed, that there are other Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of things besides Local Separation; So there are other Motions, besides Local Motion; as every Mutation from one State to another, in Generation, Corruption, and the like; and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Intellection, and Volition, there may be such Spiritual Motions, without any Local Motion whatsoever, wheras Local Motion is only a Transition or passing from one Part or Place of the Matter to another, as I shall also shew heerafter: And now I may safely affirm that such Local Motion is only Local Motion, and neither more nor less, nor other: for as this Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Proposition is most true, That Local Motion is Local Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: So the Predicate therof being Adaequate to the Subject, it can be neither more nor less, nor other then the Subject. Now that this Local Motion which Properly belongeth to the Matter is an Instrument not only of Matter, but also of all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Spirits (becaus they are Material, or Conjunct with the Matter in their Consubstantiation, and also in their Operation, as well as Extension, Figure, and the rest) I easily grant: but must wholy deny that Aether, Air, Water, Earth, or any other Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Spirits; Heat, Cold, Moisture, Driness, Vegetation, Sensation, and innumerable other Spiritual Qualitys are only Local Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, one way, or other, or any way whatsoever: for then Local Motion should not be only an Instrumental Causality or Effect, of all those Spirits and Spiritual Qualitys, but the very Essence and Formality, or Formal Caus therof; which is most Uncouth and Inconceivable: for they are Formaly every one of them Such
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61550:30"/>
as they are in themselves; as well as the Matter is Matter in it Self, without any Actual Motion: and so also Extension is For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maly Extension in it Self, and may Exist and be Such, without any Actual Motion: and Figure is Formaly Figure in it Self, and may Exist, and be Such, without any Actual Motion: and so any other Accidents of Matter: much more Spirits and Spiritual Qualitys: which I shall now very plainly prove. <hi>In the Begining God Created the Heaven and the Earth</hi>; and not only Matter and Motion: nor could Matter by Motion Diversify it Self in the Begining into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth; that is, as I have before explained them, Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aether, Aether, Air, Water, and Earth: for no local Motion can be in an instant; but the Begining was only the First Instant, otherwise it should not be the First or Begining: Wheras Local Motion being from Place to Place, which are several Terms, must necessarily be in several Instants: and most Probably there was no Local or any such Natural Motion in the first <hi>Chaos,</hi> but only the Spirit of God Supernaturaly Moved on the face of the Waters. Also if several Local Motions were the Formalitys or Formal Beings of all Spirits, and Spiritual Qualitys, then they should not be before nor after, nor any longer, then the Local Motion doth continue: for the Formality of any thing is the very Specifical Being therof; (as Wind which is indeed only <hi>Aer Motus</hi> continues no longer then the Motion) and Nothing can be without the Specifical Being of it Self; otherwise it should not be what it is. Wherefore I suppose I may set this down as another Infallible Canon (according to which also I may safely proceed) that Whatsoever Actualy Exists without somthing which doth not then also Actualy Exist, must Realy differ from it; otherwise the same thing should Actualy Exist, and not Exist at the same time, which is Contradictory, and Impossible. And thus as I have proved Substances, which did Actualy Exist in the Begining, to differ Realy from Accidents, which did not then Actualy Exist; So particularly Spiritual Substances and their Qualitys, which do or may Actualy Exist without any Actual Local Motion, must necessarily be Realy Different from it. And this is most Sensibly Evident that they may so Exist, and be, without any Local Motion; and when they are in Local Motion, are Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly rather Causes therof, then Caused by it; and so they Caus
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61550:30"/>
Motion in the very Matter, which of it self would Perpetualy Rest in the Center, and due Position of it Self, as I have said, and shall heerafter prove, and is Disturbed and Moved by the <hi>Potentiae</hi> of Spirits, which alter the Natural Position, Figure, Density, and Gravity therof: and Properly it hath no Natural Motion of it Self, but only to restore it Self unto Rest. Nor can the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Motion, and any or all the other Accidents or Variations therof, Formaly Caus the Spirits, or Spiritual Qualitys: but are only Instruments, and fit Bodies therof, which they form for themselves. Take Wax, and Move it this Way, or that Way; or Mold it into this, or that Figure; or Discind it into any Threads or Corpuscles, or Mechanicaly Vary the Matter therof how you will; yet it will still be Wax, as well as every part of Water is Water; Unless there be also some new Generation, or Corruption, therof by Spirits, and Spiritual Qualitys, as I shall shew heerafter. Wherefore that which some call Texture, whether Extrinsecal, as Figure, Porosity, or plain Interweaving of Threads or Filaments, and the like; or Intrinsecal, as Density and Rarity, (which indeed are the only true Intrinsecal Textures of Bodys and yet are wholy denied by our Textorian Philosophers) as well as Local Motion, is only Instrumental, and no Formal Caus, or Being, of any Spirit or Spiritual Quality. And so take Common Water and Spirit of Wine, Vitriol, or any stronger Spirits; and setting them in their several Vessels one by another, Inspect them with a Microscope; and see if you can discern any such Proportionable and Consyderable Difference of their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension, Figure, Density, Gravity, Local Motion, or any Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Texture whatsoever, as there is of their Spirits, and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Qualitys. Or take any Aethereous Globules, or <hi>Materia Subtilis,</hi> Emittent, Transmittent, or Remittent (if you can tell where to find it) or the most Subtile and Pure Air, which may be had on the Top of the highest Mountain, and which is Common Matter as well as any other, and putting this Matter into any Windgun, Airpump, or <hi>Expansor,</hi> or any such <hi>Torcular,</hi> or other Rack of Nature whatsoever, or applying to it any Chymical Fire, or Heat, or Salt and Snow, or what you will, and vex it how you will; and try if you can force it to Confess it Self to be any other thing then Air, or Extort from it all, or any of these Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual

Diversifications, or such as may be Effected by the like Experiments made of Vapor, Water, or Earth, or any parcel or part of the Terraqueous Globe, and <hi>Cortex</hi> therof.

                  </gap> of them. Wherefore since Matter and Spirits do thus Differ, not only in our Mind and Reason, but in their own Natures, I Conclude them both Realy to Be, and Realy to Differ one from the other: and not to be only Matter and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions therof.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Accidents are either Common, or Proper; Common Accidents are such as were Concreated, and Actualy Existed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Substances in the Begining, and without which no Substances, or any Created Entity whatsoever, can Actualy Exist: as all Quantitys; whether discrete, as Number: for every Creature that is whatsoever it be, must also be Numerable. Or Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive as Duration: for every Creature that is, whatsoever must also be Durable, or Temporary. Or Consistent, as Extension; which though is be in it Self Proper to Matter, yet as the Matter of the whole World is a Common Matter, so as I have shewed, it doth Coextend or Contein all Spirits, and every Creature that is in Heaven or Earth must necessarily be Localy therin, that is, in the Universal Body of the Matter, or <hi>Vbi</hi> therof, and in some Part or Place therof; that is, it must be there where it is, and no where els at the same Time. Proper Accidents are such as Originaly Flow from, and Subsist in their Proper Substances: as Consistent Quantity, Extension, Figure, Density and the rest in Matter; and Spiritual Qualitys in Spirits. Again these Simple Accidents may be either Compounded together, or Several; and yet mutualy Relating one to another, and Such Relations may also be Real; as First and Last in Successive Quantity, or Time: for they Realy are Such in the Successive Nature therof; which otherwise should not be Successive; and are not only Notional, such as First or Last in Consistent Quantity, or Extension; for they are not Realy such in the Consistent Nature therof; becaus it is Consistent altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and so the First may be Last, or the Last First, according
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61550:31"/>
to our Notion and Institution therof. Also there are other more Complex Relations which may likewise be Real; either Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical; as a Triangle and three several Lines are different things, or Physical, as Beauty, which is a Relative Conformity of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Lineaments and Colors to the Physical Law therof. Or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as Virtue; which is a Relative Conformity of Actions, Modes and Circumstances to the Moral Law therof. Or Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical, as Piety; which is a Relative Conformity of Actions Modes and Circumstances to the Theological Law therof, and the like: which being more Complex, are also more Curious and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; and the Relative Conformitys therof are Not only Real, but also the Excellencys and Perfections of those Realitys wherin they Relatively and Realy Subsist. And this Relative Reality, though i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And heer I shall Conclude with this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Observation, That though Substances Excell in Entity, becaus they Subsist in themselvs; yet Accidents Excell in Bonity, becaus they Perfect their Substances.

Wherof it is again said, That there was an Earth, Comprehending also the Water, as I have before shewed. And the Water is heer called Deep; which generaly in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Style signifys Deep Water, or Sea (and heer the Element of Water) like <hi>Altum</hi> and <hi>Profundum</hi> in the Latin. Also the Waters are expresly mentioned in the following Sentence. But Earth and Water were not first Created such a Terraqueons

Globe as now they are, and were afterward so Divided and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in the Third Day, and then first made to be such an Ocean of Waters and Dry Land both appearing together, and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing one Surface and Circumference of their common Globe; for that was the very Work of the Third Day. Wheras the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist saith of this first Creation of the Earth, <hi>Thou covered'st it with the Deep as with a Garment.</hi> And the same is implied heer in these words, <hi>And Darkness was upon the face of the Deep</hi>; that is, of the Waters, which first covered the Earth; and not Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon the face of the Earth, which was then covered with the Waters. Also the Darkness, which was the Antecedent Privation of Light, doth imply the Informity and Inanity, both of Aether, which is the Elementary Fountain of Light, and of Air, which is the Vehicle therof to the Terraqueous Globe; and that as the Water was Created above the Earth, so they above the Waters: for it is said the Darkness which was then in them was upon, or above the Waters. And so God saith to <hi>Iob</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Sea, <hi>When I made the Cloud</hi> (that is the Dark Air) <hi>the Garment therof and thick Darkness a swadling Band for it.</hi> And so also was the Aether, from which the Light was afterward Emit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted through the Air to the Terraqueous Globe, above the Air. And this Situation of the Elements may plainly appear by the Order of the Succeeding Creation: wherin the Aether, which is highest and next to the Superaether (which as I have said proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly was perfected in the Begining) was first furnished with Light, and then the Air with Vapors, and lastly the Terraqueous Globe with Vegetatives, in the Three first Days. And so again the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Starrs, and then the Air and Water with Fowls and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes, and lastly the Earth with Beasts, in the Three last Days. Also I collect from this Original Situation of the Elements that their Several Bodys of Matter were Proportionable and Conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able therunto; that is, the Matter of Earth was most Dens, and consequently most Grave, and therefore Lowest; the Matter of the Water less Dens, and consequently less Grave, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore above the Earth; the Matter of the Air more Rare, and consequently more Light, and therefore above the Water; the Matter of the Aether more Rare, and consequently more Light, and therefore above all the other Elements, and next to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraether
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61550:33"/>
which is most Rare, as a fit Habitation for pure Spirits. And that as every Element had its Proper Body of Matter, so also its Proper Elementary Substantial Spirit Pure, and Unmist in the first Creation therof. And it was the Work of the Spirit of God Moving upon the face of the Waters to Prepare and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispose them by fit Mistion and Temperature of them all; and thereby to Produce their Proper Qualitys out of their Potentiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys into Act, Gradualy and Successively. And that their Potential Qualitys, and also all other Simple and Primitive Substantial Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, not only Elementary, but in and with them Vegetative and Sensitive, and all their Potential Qualitys, were Created in the Begining together with the Matter: that is, Vegetative Spirits, and Sensitive Spirits of Beasts in the Earth and of Fishes in the Water: for so it is said, <hi>Let the Earth bring forth Grass,</hi> &amp;c. and again, <hi>Let the Earth bring forth the Living Creature after his Kind,</hi> &amp;c. and so also, <hi>Let the Waters bring forth abundantly the Moving Creature that hath Life,</hi> &amp;c. which plainly implys, that these Spirits were in them before, otherwise they could not so bring them forth.

The Author of the Wisedom of <hi>Solomon</hi> calleth it <hi>Matter without Form</hi>: that is, without any Corporeal Formosity, or any Mistion or <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Misti</hi> as they term it. Both Greeks and Latines generaly call it <hi>Chaos</hi>; and have preserved the Historical Tradition therof, which they received from Antiquity. But they seem also to Comprehend in their <hi>Chaos</hi> the Superaether as well as all the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or otherwise to have had no knowledg therof. Also they Confound all together in one <hi>Congeries</hi>: and thence have fansied that the fower Elements had their Actual Qualitys Existing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in in their highest Degrees, and that there was Extreme Discord and Enmity among them. And so <hi>Empedocles</hi> and others make <hi>Lis</hi> and <hi>Amor</hi> Original Causes of all things; which were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Comtempered therin: and the Poet accordingly;

                  </q>
But upon the Review of our Divine History, as I find no farther mention of the Superaether in any of the Works of the Six Days, and therefore conceiv it to have been Perfected in the Begining and first Creation therof, (for so it is said of it; <hi>Whose Builder and Maker is God,</hi> that is more Immediately and only by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Creation therof, without any Mediate Preparation Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposition and Mistion, as of the Elements and Elementary Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and so that it was no part of this Elementary <hi>Chaos</hi> which was afterward Perfected in the Six Days) so also I rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv that there was only Imperfection in the first <hi>Chaos</hi>; and that all the first Elements were first Created in their several Situati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Rest and Peace without any such Discordant Confusion, which is reserved for the last Dissolution and <hi>Gehenna.</hi> And the Hebraical words, Inform, and Inane, seem rather to infer such an Emptiness and Privation, then any Positive Contrariety of Qualitys then Actualy Existing in it: and it is said expresly, that there was Darkness, or <hi>Purae Tenebrae,</hi> therin, without any Light; and so probably no Heat; which if it had been Actualy Exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in such Extremity therof might have prevailed over the rest, as it shall in the last Conflagration; or at least would have cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Vapors to ascend from the Waters before the Second Day; if the Air had all been so prepared by Mistion and the Actual Qualitys therof: But probably there were no such other Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litys then Actualy Existing: for if not Heat, then consequently not Cold, which is the Contrary therof. And the Earth is not Denominated Dry untill the Third Day; and if there were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no Driness, then consequently no Moisture; and so of the rest. And the Author of <hi>Esdras</hi> saith, <hi>There was Silence on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry side,</hi> without any Sibilation or Tumult of Heat and Cold or the like. And though not only Matter, but the Created Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Spirits of the fower Elements and others, did then so Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aly Exist in the Begining when they were first Created, and the Heavens or Aether, and Air, and Earth, or Water and Earth, were thereby then so Denominated; as I have already shewed; yet their first Simple Qualitys, Heat, Cold, Moisture, Drines,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61550:34"/>
and others, which are Accidents, and Subsist in their Substances and were then also Created first in their Potentiality; did not Actualy Exist, but were afterward Produced out of their Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality into Act in the Six Days. And the Elements, though Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Pure and Unmist severaly in themselvs, and separately in their own Spheres, yet were Miscible, and their Natural Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection was to be Mist; and so it was accordingly performed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward: and by that very M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>stion and Temperature their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Qualitys were Produced out of Potentiality into Act, which otherwise could not Actualy Exist severaly by reason of their own Vehemence and Extremity. And certeinly there are such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Qualitys, which are not only Degrees or More or Less of the same Mist Quality (as there are Degrees of Corporeal Quantity) which very Contrariety by a fit Mistion and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature doth mutualy Qualify them, and so Produce them by Degrees out of their Potentiality in Generation; and the Excess of either of them doth again destroy the other in Corruption; and thereby also would destroy itself if it were not so Tempered by the Contrary. And I thus judg therof, becaus otherwise there could be no Mistion or Temperature of Contrary Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys in their Actual Extremitys, which would destroy one another: but they are not so Actualy Contrary in their Potentialitys (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus then they are only Potential) whereby they are easily Mist at first, and so proceed by degrees to be both Actuated toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their mutual Mistion and Temperature. And this Order of Generation and Corruption is the very Cours of Nature that was ordeined in the Six Days. And as in the Begining none of these Qualitys did Actualy Exist in their own Vehemence and Extremity, so never since can either of such Contrary Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys Actualy Exist without the other which should so Temper and Qualify it. Also all Secondary Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>alitys which are Compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of such first Simple Qualitys cannot possibly Exist without such Composition and Mistion, becaus their Compound Nature is to be Mist of others. But though the first <hi>Chaos</hi> was thus Inform and Inane, without any such particular Figures of Bodys, or Spiritual Qualitys, or any such Substantial or Accidental Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion or Composition; yet as the Matter and several Elementary Spirits were severaly Consubstantiated therin, whereby they were
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61550:34"/>
then Actualy Heaven and Earth, though not such as afterward, and as now they are; So also we may not conceiv them to have been without any Actual Accidents whatsoever; for they must necessarily have those Common Accidents which were Concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated with them, wherof I have formerly discoursed, Actualy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isting; becaus no Created Substance whatsoever can Exist or Be without them, and the matter had the general Accidents ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Actualy Existing in it. And of these and the Products ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of both Common and Proper to Matter, as they were Concrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it, or wherof it was capable, I shall now proceed to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours.</p>
               <p n="3">III. And first I shall consyder Quantity generaly: which though it be severaly and Specificaly Threefold, Number, Time, and Extension; yet all of them are Genericaly One, or that which we by one common Name call Quantity: and they are so One, not only Nominaly or Notionaly, but Realy and Physicaly; as shall appear by the Real and Physical Analogy and Confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that is between them; which as it is most Proportionable and Regular in itself, so if it were rightly consydered in all Statike Machins or Engines, any Artist might thereby without the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and charge of Experiment set down in his Mind or Paper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand what the Effect and Execution will be: and all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Errors in that Art proceed from the Universal Error or Ignorance heerof. As one saith of their various Essays of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Motion; that they have all proved vain and ineffectual, <hi>Non rite observatis Proportionibus</hi>: for what is gained by one Quantity will be lost by others: as what is gained by Distances from the Center, Multiplication of unequal Wheels, and the like, is again lost in the Total Summ of the whole Account of Proportions, in Time, Number, longer, or more Circumvolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d the like; which at last cast up together will amount to no more then a Balance, or <hi>Aequipondium</hi>: and these several ways are only several Variations of the Quantitys; which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>et may be very useful and advantagious, accordingly as we have more or less Weight or Power, or more or less Time, and the rest, to imploy and lay out in the Operation. Such are the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Statera,</hi> or French Beam, the Leaver, the Skrew, the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61550:35"/>
the Snake Wheel, Cranes, and the like. And the common Culinary Jack may plainly discover the use and advantage therof, in Diminishing the Burden of the Weight by Multiplication of the Distances and Revolutions; as if the Weight were divided into so many several Parts or less Weights as it hath such Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions in the Whole, and one of them only were to be Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at one Distance and by one Revolution. Or the Burden of the Weight in a contrary way may be Multiplied by Diminishing the Distances and Revolutions. Or there may be a delivery of all at once, as in Catapults, Balists, and the like. And of all these the whole Account will ever be Equal, as I have said (allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only for Frictions and Attritions, and the like) And this wonderful Analogy of Quantity is not only thus useful in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical Practice, but also in Philosophical Contemplation; which I shall now accordingly Improve. And becaus, as I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly observed, Number is the Discerner of both the other Quantitys, and most Discernible in it self, I shall heer begin with it; and thereby endeavor to Explicate the most Indiscerni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Mysteries of Time and Extension: though I esteem no Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity Mystical, or Cabalistical, in Virtue, or Signification; but only intend such Natural Mystery's therin as are Incomprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to us and our Reason.</p>
               <p n="4">IIII. The first Principle of Number is an Unit, which is U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in it self, and Disunity from others; wherof all Number doth consist: but it is no Number in it self, being only an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Principle therof: for all Number is Quantity Discrete, and such Discretion must necessarily be of more then One: Yet all other Numbers are only so many Ones, but One is most In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely and Individualy One in it self, having both the same Root and Square. And it is Analogous to an Instant, or Point, but Different from both, and each of them one from another. For an Unit may either severaly Exist, as in one Instant; or Coexist, as in many Points, but an Instant can only Exist severaly and Successively; for Past, Present, and Future, cannot be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then several and Successive; and a Point can only Coexist, for it cannot be otherwise then in a Body which is Consistent. Also as all Number is only so many Ones, becaus it is Discrete;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61550:35"/>
so it is only so many several Ones Discreted one from another: Yet as it is so many Ones Discretely, so it may be also one Many Complexively, which yet is not Properly One, or a Unit; for that cannot be Divided or Discreted, nor hath any Halvs, Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or other Fractions whatsoever, which are indeed so many Ones in themselvs, wherof a Proper Unit is not capable, but any Number is only one Many Complexively, which is an Improper Unit, and Properly many Ones; and may therefore be so Divided and Discreted. So that indeed there is no Fraction or Surd in Number rightly consydered in itself, but only in Time, or Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or other things Numbred thereby: as Weight, Money, and the like; wherof if any can give the Intire Proportions, he hath also the Complete Number, resulting from the thing itself. Thus of all these three Concreated Surveiors of Nature, which we call Quantitys, Number is the most Perfect and Regular, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Arithmetike is also most Perfect and Regular, wholy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of Rules, and not, like Geometry, of Innumerable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems and Propositions, which are only as several Accounts of so many particular Sums. And indeed it is so Regular and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, that I know not what may be added to it farther, except perhaps some more special Rules for greater facility and expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherof I may heerafter occasionaly give some other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, and shall now only mention for an Example the common Instance of the Changes of any Number used in Bells, Anagramms, or the like. Wherof there is this special Rule: Multiply the Product of the last Number Multiplied by the next Simple Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, As Once One is One; Two Ones are Two; Three Twos are Six; Fower Sixes are Twenty fower; Five Twenty fowers are One Hundred and twenty; Six One Hundred and twentys are Seaven Hundred and twenty; and so Indefinitely: and such alway will be the Changes therof. The Reason wherof is very plain and evident; which is, that S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>x will make Six several Fives by Changing or setting aside one every time, and so consequently it conteins the Six several Products of Five Multiplied as aforesaid; and so the rest one of another. Certeinly Arithmetike is not only most Regular in it self; but also most Useful in other Arts: becaus Number is the Measure of all Finite things which God hath Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be Measured thereby, even Time and Extension itself,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61550:36"/>
(and so is Time of Extension, but not contrarily) and so there is great Use therof in Chronology and Geometry: and it is indeed the most excellent Mathematical Science, though we have gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raly appropriated the very Name of <hi>Mathesis</hi> to Geometry; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus it doth more exercise Human Wit, which is better pleased with Curious Difficultys, then that which is more plain and facile, though no less true and evident.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The first Principle of Time or Duration is an Instant, which is only the very Present while it Actualy is, and so excludes both Past and Future, which cannot possibly Exist together with it; and yet as it passeth away continualy maketh a Successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Instants, and that Succession is Time or Duration. But eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Instant doth severaly Exist in itself, and is not Successive, and consequently no Time or Duration; as an Unit is no Number: for Succession is of one after another, and therefore of more then One, but an Instant is only One. And so the Begining or First Instant did necessarily Exist severaly; for there was none before it, otherwise it should not have been the Begining; and the Next Instant was after it, otherwise it should not have been the Next: and there is the same Reason of all the Instants which have been since, or ever shall be. Whereby we may Apprehend the Nature therof, though we can never Comprehend it, being swifter then any Thought which might Comprehend it. And becaus Instants are of so Minute a Nature, therefore they are not only Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible, but also Innumerable to us, and though in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects Analogous to Units and Points, yet therefore not so Discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible as Units; and almost as Incomprehensible as Points, wherof I shall discours in the next Paragraph. And yet certeinly there are such Instants severaly Existing as well as Units, for all Time or Duration is composed of them, as well as Number of Units. And we may not deny any thing that Realy is in Nature, and which we can Apprehend, though we cannot Comprehend it. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we may deny Time and Duration itself as well as Instants, wherof it is apparently Composed, becaus it is only the Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of several Instants, which do and must necessarily Exist seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raly; and therefore not only Realy are, but are Realy several in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mselves; becaus only the Present Instant now Actualy is, as I
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61550:36"/>
have shewed, and yet what they are, or how Time or Duration is Composed of them, doth f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rr exceed all Human Reason, and the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Comprehension therof.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. The first Principle of Extension is a Point; which is only an Indivisible Atom, and no Extension in itself; becaus Extension is of Part beyond Part, but an Indivisible hath no Parts, otherwise it should be Divisible into them. And becaus it is the Principle of Extension, which is Quantity Consistent, therefore it must also Consist, or Coexist, and cannot Exist severaly. And so though it be Analogous to Units and Instants in other respects, yet by reason therof it is more Incomprehensible, not only then Units, but also then Instants; becaus Instants do Exist severaly, and therefore may be truly Apprehended as several, and by themselvs; but Points only Coexist, and therefore may not be truly Apprehended as several, or by the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>selvs, but only as Consistent with others in Corporeal Extension, and so are wholy Indemonstrable. Nor is a Point the only Indemonstrable thing in Mathematical Science, but the very Caus and Ground of the Indemonstrability of all other <hi>Asymmetra</hi> or Incommensurabilitys. And to Demonstrate this Indemonstrability I shall offer this Proposition, To reduce three square Inches (or any <hi>Talia qualia</hi>) to a Square, or indeed any others wherof there is no Square Root; which I suppose can never be Squared by any Division or Subdivision whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. Yet I have a Rule whereby to reduce the Three Square Inches to a Square wanting only one Portion still less and less Indefinitely, which is this; First I consider the next Square to Three which is Four Inches, wherof Two is the Square Roo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; and then I place the three Inches Rectangularly, or in the form of a Rectangular <hi>Gnomon,</hi> so as to leav a Vacant Space which should be supplied by a Fourth Inch: and I consyder the Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between this Vacant Space to be supplied, and the two Lateral Inches or Complements on each side of it from which I must borrow to supply it, which is as One to Two; and then to make a <hi>Medium</hi> between the Suppliers and Supplied I add Two more to those former Two, in all Fower; and I multiply Fower by Fower, which make Sixteen: and accordingly I divide each of the two Lateral Inches or Complements into Sixteen Portions;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61550:37"/>
that is, Fower Rows of fower such Portions, in each Lateral Inch; and then borrow one of these fower Rows from each of them; that is, two Rows of fower such Portions, in all Eight such Portions, to supply the Vacant Space or <hi>Gnomon</hi>; whereby there will remain now Three Rows, and therof only three such Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on either side of the Lateral Lines of the Complements, and each of the whole Rectangular <hi>Latera</hi> will be One Inch and Three quarters in length; according to which the Vacant Space or <hi>Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> now remaining is to be supplied; and therefore I Multiply Three by Three, which make Nine such Portions to be supplied, and I have only, as I said, Eight such Portions to supply them; and so there will now remain a Vacant Space or <hi>Gnomon</hi> of one such Portion, which, as I said, is the Sixteenth part of an Inch. Again, I consyder the Proportion between this second Vacant Space or <hi>Gnomon,</hi> which is now to be supplied, and both the two upper Lateral Rows or Complements therof, from which I must borrow to supply it, wherof each doth now contein Six such Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; that is, Fower which were in it before, and Two added to it, in supplying the first Vacant Space or <hi>Gnomon,</hi> and wherof the second Vacant Space or <hi>Gnomon</hi> was to be the third: so now I have Six and Six such Portions, in all Twelv; to which, as before, I add Two, in all Fourteen; and I Multiply Fourteen by Fourteen, which make one hundred ninety six; and so I divide each of these last Portions into one hundred ninety six less Portions; that is, Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Rows of fourteen such less Portions of each of the former greater Portions; and then I borrow one whole Row therof from each side; that is, Six and Six, in all Twelv fourteen such Portions, which make one hundred sixty eight, to supply this second Vacant Space or <hi>Gnomon,</hi> wherof there wil now remain Thirteen such less Portions on either side of the Lateral Lines of the Complements; and each of the whole Rectangular <hi>Latera</hi> will be One Inch and three quarters, wanting a fourteenth part of a quarter in length, according to which this second Vacant Space or <hi>Gnomon</hi> is now to be supplied: and therefore I Multiply Thirteen by Thirteen, which make one hundred sixty nine such less Portions; and I have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as I said, one hundred sixty eight such Portions to supply it. And so there will now remain a third Vacant Space or <hi>Gnomon</hi> of one such less Portion, which, as I have said, is the one hundred
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:61550:37"/>
ninety sixth part of of a sixteenth part of an Inch, that is the three thousand one hundred thirty sixth part of an Inch, wherof the Square Root is Fifty six, which is fourteen fowers; wheras the Square Root before was only one fower; which is a very great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas of the Vacant Space or <hi>Gnomon.</hi> And according to this Rule the Vacant Space shall still decreas Proportionably, <hi>Toties Quoties,</hi> and yet a less Vacant Space still remain, and the Square never be Completed. And this Rule is grounded upon another special Rule in Arithmetike; which is, That if of any three Successive Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers the greatest be Multiplied by the least, it will produce one less then the Midle Number Multiplied by itself. And heer it is made such by adding alway Two to the Complements according to this Rule. As before in these Examples, Fower Multiplied by Two made Eight, which was one less then Three Multiplied by Three, which made Nine. And so again Fourteen Multiplied by Twelv made one hundred sixty eight, which was one less then Thirteen Multiplied by Thirteen, which made one hundred sixty nine. And becaus some may suppose that though such Squares can never be Comple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed by this Rule, yet it may possibly be done some other way, (which I am confident cannot be, and that none by any other can come neerer to it then by this Rule) yet for their farther sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction heerin I shall offer them several other confessed <hi>Asym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metra.</hi> As the Proportion between any Diagonial Line and the Lateral Line of the same Square. And I have another Rule whereby also such an Asymmetry may be reduced to one Portion still less and less Indefinitely, and yet shall never be Completed: which is this, First I consyder of what other Square the Diagonial Line of the Square given would be a Lateral Line. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; if the Square given be Fower Inches, wherof the Square Root is Two, I add that which is the only Square Root before it, and that is One; and then I say, One and Two make Three, which Square Root Three being Squared makes Nine Inches, and Nine is doubly as much as Fower, more One. Now I know that the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral Line of a Square which conteins doubly as many Inches as the Square given is the Diagonial Line of the Square given. And so I say, the Diagonial Line of the Square of fower Inches which was the Square given is Three Inches in length, Disquaring one from the Square of Nine Inche<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Again I add together both the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61550:38"/>
of each of the former Square Roots which were Two and Three in all Five, which must be the next Square Root according to this Rule: and then let the Square therof be given which is Twenty five. Now to find the Diagonial Line therof I again add to Five the first Square Root of the first Square given, which was Two, in all Seaven; which Square Root being Squared makes Fourty nine; and Fourty nine is doubly as much as Twenty five, less one. And so of Five and Seaven, which make Twelv; and Five and Twelv which make Seaventeen, and the rest according to the aforesaid Rule Indefinitely; wherof the Disproportion will be Interchangably One more, and One less. And the Reason of this Rule is, that wheras the Diagonial Line of any Square alway makes a Lateral Line of another Square conteining doubly as much as the former, there is no such Square Root wherof the Square doth contein doubly as much of the Square of any other Square Root whatsoever. And so the Proportion between any Line of an Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral Triangle and the Perpendicular Line therof will ever be Asymmetrous, becaus there is no Square Root of three Fourths of any Square, which is the Proportion between them. But the most known and common Instance of this kind is the Quadrature of the Circle, which though as the rest may still be reduced to a Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion less and less Indefinitely, yet can never be Completed: <hi>Curtae n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And particularly that there is a Complete and Perfect Proportion between any Circle and such a Square wherof the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter</hi> of the Circle is the Lateral Line, that is of the Square Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed; for apparently there is a certein Proportion between the <hi>Perimeter</hi> and <hi>Diameter</hi> of the Circle, and so consequently between the Circle and such a Diametrical Square, as I may so call it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus the <hi>Diameter</hi> of the Circle is the Lateral Line therof. Which Proportion though it can never be known nor expressed in Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Number, yet we know according to common Rule, That if you Multiply half the <hi>Perimeter</hi> by half the <hi>Diameter</hi> of the same Circle, that is, if you suppose a Rectangular Parallogramm so made that the Length shall be equal to half the <hi>Perimeter</hi> of the Circle, and the Breadth equal to half the <hi>Diameter</hi> of the same

                     </gap>ter</hi> by the whole <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimeter,</hi> which are tantamount. And thus you may measure the Arch Quadrant, or Semiquadrant, or more or less part of the Circle, as well as any Triangle; for so you measure only within the Angles, and to the Angles, and therefore the Angles which make the Excrescential <hi>Superficies</hi> beyond the Circularity can make no difference in the one more then in the other. And from all these consyderations of a Circle I find the Regular Proportion or Analogy between any Circle and the Square therof Excribed to be this; That as the <hi>Perimeter</hi> of the Circle is in Proportion to the <hi>Perimeter</hi> of the Square, so are the Square Inches of the Circle in Proportion to the Square Inches of the Square. Now that all this very large and tedious Discours may not seem Impertinent, I shall make that Improvement therof which I intended; and from it draw these Consectarys. First that Mathematicaly, or accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Mathematical Science, Extension is and must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be supposed to be Divisible into alway Divisibles; becaus by such Mathematical Rules, as before, I can Divide and Subdivide it Indefinitely. Next that Physicaly, and in its own Nature, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension is not, nor cannot be possibly Divided into alway Divisibles; Becaus, if there could be any such Physical Division and Subdivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion therof Perpetualy, then such Proportions should never be Physicaly Completed. Lastly, that since there is Actualy such a Physical Completion, which, as I have shewed, can never be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by Divisibles or any Extended Parts of Extension, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it must necessarily be by somwhat not Divisible, but Indivisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and not Extended in itself. And heer I suppose we may a while make a Stand, and gaze with Admiration and Amazement at these wonderful M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sterys, which have hitherto puzled, and will still puzle the greatest Wits of the World: neither shall I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to absolv them; but only offer what seemeth to me most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable. Certainly, <hi>Vero nihil verius</hi>; for all Verity is one and the same in itself, and with itself, and cannot Contradict itself. Wherefore that which is Mathematicaly true cannot be Physicaly fals; and that which is Physicaly true cannot be Mathematicaly fals; but one or other of these ways of Demonstration must be fallacious.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61550:39"/>
And for mine own part I shall rather believ Nature, which is the Art and Institution of God, then any Mathematical Art or Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>on of Mankind. And I must suspect our own Mathematical Art to be fallacious heerin, and the fallacy to ly in this; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus we can easily discern Extension which is Divisible, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not discern Indivisible Points, we indifferently apply our Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Rules of Division and Subdivision both to Divisible Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and also to Indivisible Points, not knowing where to stop, nor being able to discern between them; and so go on Perpetualy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ding to such Mathematical Supposition, though there be no such Perpetual Process in Nature. Which is as if we should so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed beyond an Unit, and divide it into Halvs, Quarters, and the like. Or as if becaus I can Divide fower Angels into two Twos, and again Subdivide each Two into two Ones, which I may truly do; I should also therefore proceed to Divide each one Angel into Halvs, and Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arters, and the like Perpetualy, which I may not likewise do; becaus each Angel is Indivisible in himself, and in his own Nature, and hath no such Halvs, or Quarters; and yet Arithmeticaly I might so go on to Divide and Number, if I did not know the Angelical Nature to be Indivisible. And though we know a Point to be Indivisible, yet becaus it is so Indiscernible that we know not where to find it out, we go on still so to Divide and Subdivide perpetualy according to our Mathematical Rules. And thus though it may be maintained by way of Argument that <hi>Quantitas est Divisibilis in semper Divisibilia,</hi> yet it is Invincibly confuted by a contrary Argument drawn from that very Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Divisibility of the Quantity, that is, the Impossibility therof; and on this I chiefly insist; For if there were any such Possibility of Perpetual Division therof Physicaly and in Nature, though I easily grant it might never be actualy Future (as many Possibles shall never be Actualy in any future Time) yet I can never admit that there can be any Possibility of that which yet cannot Possibly be Actual, which they must affirm who hold the Contrary Positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and so indeed they very freely acknowledg, that it is so alway Potentialy or Possibly, but can never Actualy. But as Futurity of that which never Actualy shall be, is a plain Contradiction; so Possibility of that which never Actualy can be, is equaly Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory: for as Future, or Shall be, and Shall not be; so Possible,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61550:39"/>
or Can be, and Can not be, are Contradictory Terms. And all Possibility is the Possibility of being Actualy, and not of being Possibly or Possibility of Possibility, which is Childish and Nuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and only a Reduplication in Terms of the same Thing in itself. Nor is it only Contradictory in Terms, but also in the Thing itself: For we do not now discours of Quantity Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, wherin there may be a Perpetual Possibility of Succeeding Futurity; but of Quantity Consistent, wherof all the Divisible Parts, and Indivisible Points, do and must necessarily Consist and Coexist Actualy together in the same Present Instant, and not in several Future and Successive Instants. Nor do we now discours Mechanicaly, or of any such Mechanical Division of a Body into less Wholes, or of the Possibility of such Actual Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the Parts from the Whole Localy, but of the Actual Extension of Part beyond Part, according to the Nature of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Quantity as it is in itself, and the Mathematical Division of the Parts in the Whole Extensively: And so whatsoever, or howsoever many the Parts of that Extension given be, they are already and in the Present Instant Actualy what and so many a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> they are, and cannot be greater or more then they are. And I suppose no Mathematician doth contemplate the Local Divisibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which is Possible, but only the Extensive Division of the Parts, which is Actual in the Whole; wherin only they are such Mathematical Parts; wheras being Localy Divided from the Whole they become less Wholes in themselvs. And so such Possibility is not at all to be regarded in this present Discours, but only the Actuality whatsoever it is; and then the Position thus rightly explained doth amount to this, That the Extensive Parts Actualy in the Whole are Actualy Innumerable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not only to us, or by any our Mathematical Division or Subdivision, which I have already granted; but also Physicaly, and in their own Nature, which is Impossible. For then the least Extensive Whole should be equal to the greatest; because both have equaly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Parts in themselvs; for Innumerable can neither be more nor less then Innumerable. Nor will it be evaded by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the greater Whole hath Innumerable greater Parts, and the less Innumerable less Parts; for Innumerable Parts, though never so small will suffice to make any Whole whatsoever, though
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61550:40"/>
never so great; becaus Innumerable is Innumerable; and doth not only afford whatsoever may be wanting, but can never be spent or exhausted. And becaus every least Part hath some Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension, and Measure therof; therefore the Whole of such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Parts must also be Immensurable which (as <hi>Archimedes</hi> hath demonstrated in his <hi>Psammites</hi>) is both Rationaly Impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, and Mathematicaly Fals. But whatsoever Notion Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians may have of such Divisibility into less and less Parts Perpetualy, yet certeinly none can deny the gross Whole of any Corporeal Extension given (whatsoever the Extent therof may be) to be Mensurable, and Finite; otherwise it could not be given, nor indeed Actualy be, as I have formerly Demonstrated. And I am very secure of that Argument and of the clearnes and firmnes therof; however men may determin concerning this other Question, which I have also prosecuted for a farther Discovery of Truth. And I must heer observe that not only Extension, but also Time, and Number, and whatsoever hath Parts; yea all Qualitys, and whatsoever hath Degrees; and all that is in any kind susceptible of More and Less, may as well be affirmed to be thus Divisible into alway Divisibles. And so wheras Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians make several Degrees of the fower first Qualitys, and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians of Musical Notes, and the Like, I can again Divide and Subdivide them Indefinitely aswell as Extension; and Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate that there are the like Imperceptible Minims therin. And heer again we may stand and admire the Divine Wisedom and Goodnes, which hath so Plainly manifested unto us those Wholes, and greater Portions of Wholes, that are of any Use and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, and without which Scales, Dials, and all Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Instruments, and all Medicinal Compositions, and <hi>Gamu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For mine own part, as I am satisfied in knowing that there is a Circumference of the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61550:40"/>
whole Globe of the World, though I know not how large it may be; so also in knowing that there are such Physical Points, though I know not their Minute and most Exile Nature. Yet I do also conceiv that as Extension is Terminated by Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nts, so the Divisibility therof doth Terminate in Points, and that the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e are such Physical Points as well as Physical Instants, and P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Instants as well as Physical Units, though they be not equaly Discernible by us (and that Points are Points, and not only Notes, or Nothings, as some do affirm) And there is no Objection against the one, which may not also be armed and intended against the other, by such Dividing and Subdividing Perpetualy, even beyond Points, Instants, and Units themselvs, into Halvs, Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the like. And such indeed is the common Objection, Of how many Points is the least Corpuscle composed? It may be as well demanded. Of how many Instants is the least Minute of Time composed? which none can tell: though we can easily tell of how many Units, Two, which is the least Number, is composed. And I demand of such Curious Objectors, Of how many Extensive Parts or Portions the least Corpuscle is compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed? which themselvs affirm to be Innumerable; though I deny it of Parts, and dare not affirm it of Points; because it is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible: but only assert, that neither they can know of how many Parts, nor I of how many Points any Corpuscle is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed. And this I suppose to be a sufficient Answer to such a Question (for such it is rather then an Objection) But for far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther satisfaction, I shall consyder a least Corpuscle, which must be Globular aswell as the great Body of the whole World; (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus all Angles are Protuberant and render the <hi>Superficies</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessarily greater) and yet no Mathematician ever did, or ever can, assigne the whole Proportion in fact and consequently not all the particular Portions of any Globe or Circle. Also every Corpuscle, though never so litle, yet is a Body, having Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, Latitude, and Profundity; in all which the Points must Consist and Coexist, and they also in the whole Body, otherwise it should not be a Body: wheras though we know that a Body is composed of Longitude, Latitude, and Profundity, yet we know not of how many Long, Late, or Profund Lines, it is composed; becaus though they Realy are, and are Realy dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61550:41"/>
in Nature, yet they so Corporealy Consist and Coexist that they can not be Localy separated, but only in and with the Corpuscles or Body. And so though Points Realy are, and are Realy Different in Nature, yet they also so Corporealy Consist and Coexist, that they can not be Localy Separated, but only in and with the Corpuscles or Bodys: and so though Mathematicaly we may consyder them in their several Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, yet we may not therefore consyder them in separate Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istences. Whereas generaly all the Objections are drawn from the Supposition of Points Separate, or at least of Points Coexisting only in Longitude, and the like, (which are only Imperfect Principles of Extension, as well as Points.) But I have shewed that Entitys may Realy Differ, though they are not Localy Separate, or Separable: and if they grant me Points so Coexisting, not only in Longitude, but also in Latitude and Profundity, and the whole Corporeity of a Corpuscle or Body (as they must, becaus they do so Realy Coexist, and can not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise Exist in Nature) I can by that one Concession solv all their Objections, which otherwise may seem as Unanswerable, as Points are Incomprehensible; being grounded upon the very Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible Nature therof. And if they will not grant me that which is Physicaly and Realy true in itself, but argue upon fals or feigned Suppositions, I shall not much care to Answer them; otherwise then I should him who would argue upon a Suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Coexisting Instants, Past, Present, and Future; by telling him plainly, that there is no such thing in Nature: and yet there are Physical Instants Existing severaly; and so, though there is not any single Point in Nature Existing severaly, yet there are Points Coexisting in a Body. And I suppose that from this Fundamental Fallacy all the Fallacity of their Objections doth arise. But he who will rightly Philosophise, or Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logise, must be very careful that in the Contemplation of such things as are Incomprehensible, or Infinite, though he may frame Comprehensive or Finite Notions therof as Scaffolds whereby to build, yet he may not build upon them; but must again take them down, and reduce all such Subsidiary Notions or Suppositions to the very Nature of the thing it self, which is Incomprehensible, or Infinite.</p>

Thus though there be Realy in Nature Points, Lines, and <hi>Superficies,</hi> yet the Supposition of any such several Existence therof, as we may Mathematicaly feigne and frame to our selvs (and as some have supposed the whole-Body of the World to have been made by the Casual Concurrence of such Atoms or Points) is only Notional in our Reason and Mind, and not Real or in the Nature of Extension itself, wherof the least Minim is more then one single Point, yea it conteins in it Points Innumerable to us. And as there is no such several Point, so also no several Line in Nature: for the least Hair of the least Mite hath not onl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, but also Latitude; becaus it hath several Sides; and one Side therof is not the other, nor all one and the same with the Longitude. And so there is no several <hi>Superficies</hi> in Nature, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving both Longitude and Latitude without any Profundity; for the thinest Plate of <hi>Muscovy</hi> Glass hath a double <hi>Superficies</hi> above, and beneath, and also others in the very Edges therof. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not only Points, but also Longitude, Latitude, and Profun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity do necessarily Consist and Coexist together; and all these make a Complete Extension or Consistence of any Body. Now every Body, becaus it hath Longitude Latitude and Profun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, must have some Figure which is the particular Shape or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dule of the Extension therof, Resulting from, and Subsisting in that Extension (as a particular Property therof) Immediately, and Mediately in and by it in the Substantial Matter. Yet Figure Realy Differs from Extension; becaus there may be several Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of the Same Extension of the Matter which (as Statuarys say of their <hi>Materia,</hi> Wood, Stone, Wax, and the like) is capable of all Figures, Faces, or Forms whatsoever. The first and most simple Figure, and which indeed is most Proper to the Matter, is a Globe. And therefore this is the Universal Figure, and all other Particular Figures, as I have said, are only the Protube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances and Enormitys therof, though never so Symmetrical and Conformable in themselvs. And the Globular Figure is such, becaus it is most Intire and Uniting, wherof all others are only some unnecessary Excesses, or Defects; and therefore also it is most Capacious; as may plainly appear by varying the <hi>Perime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of any Circle (which hath nothing Excrescential or Excessive
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61550:42"/>
in itself) from the Circular Regularity therof, into any Angu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Figure whatsoever, for so if you Inflect it into an Isoperimetri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Equilateral Triangle, the <hi>Area</hi> therof will be less then that of the Circle, as Six to almost Ten: and if you I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And so Proportionably if you Inflect it into any other Equilateral Polygon, though I doubt all will be found Incommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable as well as the former. But yet I observ a Proportion or Analogy between the Circle and such a Square made of the <hi>Perimeter</hi> therof, or, as I may so call it, the Isoperimetrical Square therof, and the Square Excribed, which I have before termed the Diametrical Square therof; that is, As the <hi>Area</hi> of the Isoperimetrical Square of the Circle is, as I have said, in Proportion to the <hi>Area</hi> of the Circle as Eleaven to almost Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, so the <hi>Area</hi> of the Circle is in Proportion to the <hi>Area</hi> of the Diametrical Square therof, as almost Eleaven to Fourteen. And though I conceiv that every Regular Figure is Perfect in its own kind, and none other so Perfect as it, in that Respect, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Asymmetrous; yet I also conceiv that the Asymmetry or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion between a Circle and a Square is rather from the Square, which is more Imperfect Comparatively, then from the Circle, which is Absolutely the most Perfect Figure in itself: and though we commonly, as Carpenters, and other Mechanical Measurers, do rather Measure by the Square and Cube, then by the Circle and Globe, yet God and Nature work by them most Perfectly and Exactly; and so have made the World to be of the most Perfect Figure, which is Globular or Circular in the whole <hi>Superficies</hi> th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For the whole Body therof being one Homogeneous and common Matter doth Naturaly Incline and Adhere to itself, having nothing Corporeal besides itself to which it may otherwise Incline or Adhere, or which may hinder or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert it from Uniting or flowing together into one most Intire Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in it self; which, as I have said, must be Globular, becaus a Body can not possibly be in a less Space or more United then in a
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61550:42"/>
Globe. And this Union doth best preserv and fortify its own Internal Entity in itself, and so against External Nonentity. Wherefore also all Material Spirits, which are Heterogeneous Substances, do thus Unite and fortify their own Specifical Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures against Ambient Heterogeneous Enemies, by casting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs, and thereby their Bodys, which they Consubstantiate and Act, into particular Globules as much as they can; which may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by Bubbles in Water, Sparks of Steel, Shot of Lead melted, Mercurial Globules, and many such Instances. And if the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Body of the World be a Globe (as all men generaly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and therefore call it <hi>Orbis,</hi> or the Globe) then also proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly it is a most Perfect and Exact Globe; and not like the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raqueous Globe, which by the Consistence of the Earth and Hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogeneity of Earth and Water is full of Hills and Vales, Shores and Seas: but as if the Water did again cover all the Earth, and there were no Agitation therof (as it was in the <hi>Chaos,</hi> as I have shewed) it would certeinly be a most smooth <hi>Aequor,</hi> having a Perfectly Spherical <hi>Superficies</hi> of its own Body, becaus it is Fluid; so much more we ought to conceiv that the Superaether, which is Highest, and therefore most Rare, and probably most Fluid, is most Perfectly Spherical, and also becaus it must Unite together, as I shall shew heerafter. And if there be such an Exact Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of the Utmost Body of the World, then there must also be as Exact a Center corresponding to that Circumference, which must be a Physical Point; for as the Physical Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence must be in every Part therof Utmost, so the Center must be answerably Inmost, and therefore must be a single Point, not Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, nor having any Part beyond Part, because any two cannot be Inmost or Midst; for that must be something that is One, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it is: and I do not intend by this Physical Point any such least Corpuscle, as is commonly supposed, for that also hath Part beyond Part, but a very Point as it is in Nature, not Existing severaly, and according to Mathematical consyderation therof, but Coexisting in a Body Physicaly, as I have before declared: and such a Point is also the <hi>Copula</hi> of all Consistent and Coexistent Extension, and doth Terminate both the Utmost <hi>Superficies,</hi> and this Inmost Center. And as it doth thus Terminate Extension, so also Motion of Bodys; so that Naturaly they Move not above the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61550:43"/>
Utmost Circumference, or below the Inmost Center, as I shall shew heerafter. Now a Globe, as it is the Figure of the least Corpuscle, so it is Potentialy conteined in every other Figure, and as it is the Figure of the great Body of the World, doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein in it Actualy all other Figures; Which like Extension, from which they flow, are not only Points, nor Lines, which have many Points, nor any Superficies having many Lines (as a Picture which hath only several Symmetrical Lineaments) but the Complete Longitude, Latitude, and Profundity of Bodys; without which there can not be the Figure of any Body which must be Long, Late, and Profund.</p>

But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any other Body to fill these Concavitys, or not; yet the Body itself which is Porous is a Body, as well as the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the whole World is a Body, having a Superficial Convexity of itself, though there be none other Body without it. Or if it be filled with another Body, then that also which fills it is a Body, and is not the same Body, nor Spiritualy Homogeneous with it. Wherefore there were no Pores in the first Created Matter before the Intermistion of Heterogeneous Elements; for if the Body fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling were Homogeneous with the Body that is filled, then both should be Continuous, and one Intire Body without any Such Concavitys, and consequently without any Pores. As if an empty Honycomb were all filled with Bees Wax, it should no longer be a Comb, but an Intire Mass or Cake of Wax. Also though Pores be Partial Discontinuitys of the Body Porous, yet it must be partly Continuous; for if the Honycomb be cut into little pieces, and they laid asunder, the Spaces between them all are not Properly Pores of one Body, but Intervals betweeen several less Bodys; and so also the Interstices of a Sive, or Silk, or the like, are no Pores, becaus the Parts or Threads therof are only Contiguous, and not Continuous. And the Porous Body must be Consistent, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving such <hi>Vascula</hi> in the Concavitys therof as may contein the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that fills them, which must be Fluid: As if an Honycomb be
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61550:43"/>
filled with Air it is Porous, but if it were filled with Tallow, or any thing equaly Consistent, it should not Properly be said to be Porous, more then any Inameld Work, or the like: much less are Fluid Bodys said to be Porous, though they have many Consistent Corpuscles in them; as Muddy Water, and the like. And though the Porous Body be generaly more Dens, becaus it must be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent; yet it sufficeth that it be Consistent, though it be more Rare; as an Honycomb filled with <hi>Mercury.</hi> And this I suppose is that which is intended by Porosity, and which I have more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly explained, becaus there is so much discours therof among Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, especialy such who when they can give no better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Nature, resort to Pores as their <hi>Latibula</hi> and Subterfuges: wheras, as I have said, Porosity is nothing but only particular Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial Figure, or Concavity of the Body; whether the Pores be greater or less, <hi>Vasa</hi> or <hi>Vascula</hi>; as Cells of an Honycomb, or the least Holes in the Wax; and they do not in the least alter the Nature of the Porous Body consydered in itself: as Wax is not alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in its own Nature by being Molded into any Shape or <hi>Effigies</hi> whatsoever. And indeed unless we admit a Vacuity ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As the Terraqueous Globe is one Intire Globe, though it be partly Earth and partly Water, which are several Bodys as they are Earth and Water, but only one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as they are Matter: for all Discontinuity, and consequently all Porosity, is from Heterogeneity; which is not of the Matter (for that is one common Substance) but from the several Spirits. And I suppose that all Fluid Bodys are also Imporous, becaus their Parts may flow together: and so some more Consistent Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys may also be Imporous; as Glass, Gemms, Marble, and the like.</p>

And wheras generaly Porous Bodys that are filled are more Dens, and Bodys which fill the Pores more Rare, as I have shewed, it plainly appears by Porosity itself, whereby they seek to solv Density and Rarity, that they also are such in their several Simple Bodys so consydered in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs: otherwise becaus a Brass or Iron Kettle set upright with the Concavity therof above the Water will swim in Water (the Complex Extension both of the Vessel and of the Air, which fills that one great Pore of the Cavity, being in the whole more Rare, and consequently more Light, then the same Proportionable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension of Water) we might therefore affirm that the Brass or Iron in itself is not more Dens, and consequently more Heavy then the Water, nor the Air more Rare, and consequently more L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61550:44"/>
Matter of any Porous Body, and of that which fills the Pores<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> simply consydered in themselvs. And indeed if we should consyder Density and Rarity only Complexively and not Simply, there should be no Density and Rarity in the World (which would take away the very Subject of the Question) for the whole World being one Complex Body, though it consist of many particular Bodys, more Dens, and more Rare Simply in themselvs, yet is all Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens Complexively; becaus it is all one Complex Body. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore either there is no Density or Rarity in the World; or if there be, the difference therof must be in the different Simple Bodys, and particular Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Also to inquire farther into this Poro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, which is assigned to be the Formal Caus of Rarity; we will again consyder the Reason therof: which must be this, that a more Porous Body is therefore more Rare becaus the Pores are filled with more Rare Matter, unles we pleas to admitt a Vacuity therin (which is another Subterfuge of this Question) but now we will consyder it as filled with some other Matter; which if it be Equidens, will make the whole Complex Body Equidens; and therefore necessarily must be more Rare, to make the Porous Body more Rare: and then I demand, Why is that Matter more Rare which so fills it? and according to the same Reason it must likewise be, becaus that Matter is a Body more Porous and the Pores therof filled with another matter more Rare, then itself, and so Infinitely; which is both Irrational, and Impossible: for suppose the Pores of any Terreous Body to be filled with Water, and any Pores of that with Air, and any Pores of that with Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and any Pores of that with Superae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hereous Matter; yet we must at last stop somwhere, and confess, either that the last Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is more Rare in itself, which will destroy the Reason assigned, or otherwise, that the Pores therof are not filled, but that the last Porous Body hath only Interspersed Vacuitys. And so indeed whosoever doth deny Density and Rarity of the Matter in itself, if he be true to his own Reason, must hold an Absolute <hi>Vacuum</hi> in Nature; wherof I shall discours heerafter, not esteeming this sufficient occasion, nor any present Discours therof pertinent to the Question; which is, as I have said, concerning the Density or Rarity of the Matter in itself, whether Porous, or not Porous, or whether the Pores therof be filled, or not filled. Now if there be such a different Density and Rarity of the Matter itself,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61550:45"/>
then there may be Condensation and Rarefaction of the Matter itself. And becaus this is the greater Question, and doth also contein the other, I shall solemnly argue it according to my maner. Certeinly there is no such fixed Standard of Density in the Matter itself, and in the Nature therof, that it could not Possibly be more or less Dens, or that God could not have Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Matter more or less Dens, becaus there is no Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in it; for it should be Matter, whether more less Dens; and if God might as he pleased have Created the whole Matter more or less Dens, then he could also Create one part of the Matter more Dens, and another less Dens: and so indeed he hath; for he Created both Heaven and Earth; wherof the Heaven and Heavenly Bodys are less Dens, and more Rare; and the Earth and Earthly Bodys more Dens and less Rare. And if he could Create one Body more Dens, and another more Rare, then he can also caus the Dens Body to become more Rare, or the Rare to become more Dens: and so also he hath; for he made the Water which is more Dens to Ascend in Vapors, which are more Rare; otherwise they could not so Ascend into the Air: and again the Vapors which are more Rare, to Descend in Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ts and Rains, which are more Dens, otherwise they could not so De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend through the Air. Also I prove it by the Products of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity and Rarity, which are Gravity and Levity, and their very Motions of Descent and Ascent, according to the Hydrostatical Rule of <hi>Archimedes,</hi> and all others since him, That more Matter of less Extension will sink through less Matter of more Extension if it be Fluid. And this is the very Formality of Density that it is the Affection of more Matter being of less Extension; and of Rarity, that it is of less Matter being of more Extension. And if there be Density and Rarity, then also Condensation and Rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Bodys: as I have shewed; and which may be confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by many Sensible Experiments, wherof I shall mention only two, one of Condensation, and the other of Rarefaction. The first is the Impregnating of Common Water with Salt. Take a Glass Wine-bottle, and first put into it as much Salt as the Water may Imbibe, and then fill it up with Water, and stop it with a Cork, so as no Water may come forth; and being so stop'd stir it up and down by moving the Glass-Bottle until the Water be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:61550:45"/>
Impregnated with the Salt, and so made Brine; and when you let it rest again, you shall find that the Brine, which now conteins both the Water &amp; the Salt, will not fill the Bottle as before, but Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side in the Neck almost to the Belly: which doth plainly shew a Consyderable Condensation, or the same Matter of less Extension then it was before. The other shall be the common Instance of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder fired in a Gun loaded with a Bullet; which will be violently discharged by the sudden and great Rarefaction of so small a Body of Powder into so large a Body of Flame, or the same Matter of more Extension then it was before, which therefore requireth a larger Place according to the inlarged Extension therof, and explodeth the Bullet, or breaketh the Gun, to attein it; though the Flame be a very Fluid and Corporealy Infirm Body, and hath little or no Consistence in itself; and therefore also hath litle or no Porosity in it self; and if it were Porous, would rather close the Pores thereof, or return again into them by such a strong Compression, then exclude such a Solid Body as the Bullet, or break the Gun. Nor is it from any Spiritual or Active Power of the Fire, which sometimes doth not fire all the Powder; and a Windgun by Compression of Air, without any Fire, doth the like Execution. Much less is it from any Imaginary Aethereous Matter penetrating the Gun; for unles We also fansy some Imaginary Valvs, that Aethereous Matter would be far more easily forced back again, then extrude the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, or sooner break the Gun in the Entry therof then in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat. Also Glass suddenly Heated breaks by the sudden Expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; and so cooled, by the Contraction. By these, and many like Experiments, it plainly appears that there is such Conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation and Rarefaction of Matter itself, as I have before described; which yet some obstinately deny, and either will not or cannot understand it through a preconceived Error that Matter and Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion are one and the same thing; which if it were true, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess it impossible, that there should be any such Condensation or Rarefaction of the same Matter in itself; for then the Extension also must be the same, and consequently there could be no such Condensation or Rarefaction, which are Variations of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension of the same Matter: otherwise the Extension therof should be the same and not the same, which is Contradictory. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore such Condensation and Rarefaction do plainly prove it Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61550:46"/>
that Matter and Extension should be one and the same thing. But, as I have before shewed, so heerby it most evidently appeareth, that Matter is a Substance, and Extension an Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. And though no Matter can be without some Actual Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, yet that being an Accident Subsisting in the Matter, there is a Potentiality therof to be sometimes Actualy more, and sometimes Actualy less, the Matter remain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ng the same. Nor is there any Penetration of several Extensions, but only the Extension is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Varied, whether it be Inlarged, or Contracted. And so I do not affirm that there can be two Extensions of one Individual Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy when the same Matter is Contracted into itself by Condens<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>v<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that though there be such a Potentiality of more or less Extension in the same Matter that it is Boundless, or that therefore it can be Always Extended more or less, Infinitely (for More or Less as I have said is Finite, and can never be made Infinite) but as in all other things, so in this God hath set certein Natural Bounds and Limits, unknown to us, which Extension itself cannot transgress. And I shall heer farther observ, that these Variations of Extension are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Condensation and Rarefaction by Natural Generation, which do continue; becaus they are so caused by the Spirit Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing them in the Matter, and so continuing them; as in the Accension of Gunpowder, and the like: or Compression and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latation by Violent forcing of the requisite Body of Matter and Spirit itself, which therefore do not continue longer then the force lasteth, that so conteineth the Matter in that Extension; as in the Windgun, and the like: and that which we call Elasticity of the Air, wherof I shall discours heerafter, is only a Motion or <hi>Nisus</hi> to Restitution from such Violent Compression or Dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: and such Motion may be not only of the Figure, as in bending a Bow, or the like; but of the Extension itself, as in the former Experiments. And so there may be a Violent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression or Dilatation of the Extension of a Body according to the Particular Nature therof, which yet may be a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Condensation or Rarefaction according to Universal Nature, as when Air doth Expand itself <hi>Ne detur Vacuum,</hi> as I shall shew heerafter, and when it can Expand itself no farther, it

               <p n="10">X. Gravity and Levity are, as I have said, the Products of Density and Rarity, in which they Immediately Subsist, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately in the Matter; as Figure doth in Extension, and by it in the Matter. Wherefore also, as Rarity is only a less Degree of Density, so is Levity of Gravity; and all Matter whether more or less Dens, yet becaus it hath necessarily some Density, it hath also some Gravity Proportionable therunto. Thus it is said, that there is <hi>The Weight for the Wind</hi> or Air as well as the Water, and not only Air, but also Aethereal and Superaethereal Matter hath Weight in itself either Actualy or Potentialy; for if more Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Weigh more, becaus it is more Matter, and less Matter Weigh less, becaus it is less Matter, then all Matter must Weigh, becaus it is Matter: And thus <hi>Pondus</hi> is of the Matter, and <hi>Potentia</hi> of Spirits, as I have said: and becaus more Matter of less Extension is more Dens, therefore it is also more Grave; and becaus less Matter of more Extension is less Dens, or Rare, therefore it is also more Light: which plainly appears by Sinking or Swimming, as I have shewed. And more Grave Sinketh downward rather then Riseth upward through more Light, becaus it is more Dens, and Light more Rare: for all Matter tendeth first to Union with itself, and therefore it tends to the Center of itself, which is the Inmost Point within itself. And this Tendence we call Downward, which is indeed rather Inward. And as more Matter of the same Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension tendeth more swiftly to this Center, and therefore also is alway most forward, becaus it is more Dens, and consequently more strong in its kind, that is, more Ponderous; so for the same Reason it tendeth most strongly, and therefore passeth through more Light, which is more Rare, and consequently more Weak, unless it be also Consistent, which is from a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Quality, as I shall shew heerafter. And Globular Bodys of Matter though Equidens and Equiponderous, yet becaus, as I have said, that Figure is most United in itself, do therefore Move faster then Angular, or any Bodys Equiponderous, but of more Superficial Figures, through the same <hi>Medium.</hi> And now I shall discover the wonderful Mystery of Divine Geometry in
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:61550:47"/>
the Proportionable Locality of all Particular Bodys between the Center and Circumference of the Universal Body or Globe of the World: for as the Center or Inmost Point is the least, and the Circumference or Utmost <hi>Superficies</hi> therof the largest; so all the Spheres between these two as they are neerer to the Center, are less, and larger as they are neerer to the Circumference. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is most Proper, and Geometricaly Proportionable, that more Matter of a less Extension, which is more Dens, should be in a less Sphere, which doth best suffice to contein it; and less Matter of more Extension, which is more Rare, should be in a larger Sphere which is more fitt to contein it. And thus the Globe of Earth and Water, which is most Dens, is seated in the Inmost Orb of the World, which is least; and the Air, which is more Rare, in a Sphere next above it, which is more large; and the Aether, which is yet more Rare, in the next above that, which is still more large; and the Superaether, which is most Rare, in the the uppermost, which is largest. And this most Proper and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Situation of the Terraqueous Globe, and of all the Spheres doth rightly constitute both the Circumfere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ce, and the Center, of the whole World, and the most Symmetrical <hi>Chorus</hi> of all the Bodys therof, as I shall shew heerafter. And certeinly as there is but one Circumference of the whole Body therof, so also but one Center; for those two do mutualy Relate one to the other: as there can be but one Circumference and one Center in any one Body. Now that all this Body is Matter we all grant, and I suppose no Materialist will, or can deny it. Also it must be granted (as I have shewed of Density and Rarity) that Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity or <hi>Pondus</hi> is the Proper Affection of the Matter, and not of Spirits, (becaus it Subsists in the Density of the Matter) and that more Dens and Grave Bodys Naturaly do sink through more Rare and Light. And that Sinking is to this Universal Center of all the Matter, which is Lowest, and Inmost, as the Circumference is Highest, and Utmost. Wherefore if any Particular Body, which is and must be a Part of this Universal Body of Matter, be more Dens, and consequently more Grave, it must Naturaly sink through any other Bodys beneath it, which are more Rare, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently more Light, toward this Universal Center of the whole Body of Matter, which is the Center of the whole Body of the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:61550:47"/>
World, and consequently of all Particular Bodys, which are only Parts therof; and no Parts of any such Particular Bodys, which are also Matter as well as their whole Bodys, can sink Inwardly to any Center of Gravity in themselvs, as to any such Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Center: for then they should Ascend in departing from the Universal Center of Extension which is exactly <hi>Centrum Gravium,</hi> to which all tend. And though more Dens and Heavy Bodys may sometimes Ascend to prevent Vacuity, yet that is not as to any such Particular Center, but only to fill the Universal Globe when more Rare cannot succeed, as I shall shew heerafter: Or if they be supported by any Consistent Body, though more Rare, that is only a Fulciment, and <hi>Tanquam</hi> a Natural Center unto them. Wherefore as all <hi>Pondus</hi> is of the Matter, and Matter only one Homogeneous Body in itself, so there can be but one Center of the <hi>Pondus</hi> therof; though as <hi>Potentiae</hi> are of the Spirits, and they are several and Heterogeneous, so there may be several Spiritual Centers therof, (which are all of another Nature, and very farr Different from this one Universal Center of Matter) and though they be Radicaly most Dens and Strong in those several Centers, yet their Motion tendeth Outward, every way, from the Center to the Circumference of their Particular Sphere of Activity, and not as the Matter Inward, or only Downward, from the Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Center of Rest: becaus Spirits are Active and Energeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, but Matter Passive and Torpid, as I have shewed. And now I shall proceed to prove this Center of the Universal Body of the Matter of the whole World, which as I have said, is also both the Center of the Extension &amp; of the Gravity therof, to which all tend, or the Universal Center, to be in the Earth, which will also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that other Question concerning the Center of the whole World. Certeinly this is the constant Language of Scripture; and so it is said, that the Waters which covered the Earth were Beneath, and the Vapors in the Air, Above: and the Royal Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher saith expresly, The Heaven for High<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and the Earth for Depth: and I suppose none can shew any one Expression in the whole Bible, which may seem in the least to color or favor the contrary Opinion. And the Reason therof is as apparent (which I have before sufficiently declared) that Earth being most Dens, and conseque<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:61550:48"/>
Motion, which is Direct, must therefore tend to one and the same Term, which cannot be Outward, or Upward; for then Grave Bodys should Ascend; but must necessarily be Inward, or Downward, which therefore must be to one Inmost Point or Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of that Gravity. And I shall confirm this Motion of Descent by clearing a common mistake concerning the Ascent of Rare or Light Bodys: for as all Dens and Heavy Bodys do Descend, so also do Rare Proportionably; becaus they are only less Heavy, as I have said. As if a Pound Weight be put into one Scale, and two Pounds into the other, which will caus its one Scale to Descend, and thereby the other to Ascend; yet apparently the Pound Weight is also Heavy, becaus it weighs one Pound, though the two Pounds be more Heavy, and so caus that Scale Proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to Descend, and the other to Ascend. Thus the Motion of Ascent of Rare Bodys is indeed rather a being Moved, and their Ascent only a Violent Elevation by more Dens and Heavy Bodys, which crowding more strongly or swiftly to or toward the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter do Elevate and Extrude the more Rare and Light from it. Also Earth only is Consistent, and cannot be prevented in the Descent therof by any other Bodys which might be Fulciments unto it, as it may be to others; and all this doth Sensibly appear by any Terreous Body Descending through Water, and through Air, and so it would also through Aether, if it were in it, not particularly as to its Proper Element, by any <hi>Potentia</hi> of the Elementary Spirit therof, but generaly as to the Universal Center of all Matter, by the greater Density and <hi>Pondus</hi> therof. For so if a Hole were made in the Earth from the Surface therof to the Center, Water would De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend thereby to it, as well as Earth, &amp; if there were neither Earth, nor Water therin, Air would Descend likewise; and so if their were neither Earth, Water, nor Air, Ae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For though when any Particular Body or Part of the Universal Body therof is Dislocated and removed from its Proper Station and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Situation therin (which is when any more Dens Bodys are above others more Rare) they then Move or Press toward their Proper Place by their own Gravity and Motion of Descent, being thereby Actuated to reduce them therunto (as the Magnetical Virtue doth Move the Body therof being displaced towards the Poles of the Earth) yet when they have atteined it, their Motion, which was Actuated before for that end, being now useles and needles is again reduced to Potentiality, and they then neither Move nor Press Actualy any more, or any farther, nor have any Actual <hi>Nisus</hi> therunto; but having obteined their End are thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth in Peace and Rest; and their very Gravity is also suspended, and reduced to Potentiality, as the Magnetical Needle doth Rest in the North Point: which plainly shews what I said before, that though Gravity flow Immediately from Density, and Subsist in it, and Motion of Descent in the Gravity, yet they are Realy Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; becaus though the Body continue to be the same, and hath the same Density Actualy both when it is out, and when it is in its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Place, yet when it is our, it hath Actual Gravity and Gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and when it is in it, only Potential. And thus neither the Superaether doth Press upon the Aether, nor that upon the Air,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:61550:49"/>
nor that upon the Water, nor that upon the Earth, nor the Earth upon itself; becaus they are already in their Proper Places; and therefore tend no farther: for the more Dens Bodys are Natural Fulciments and so farr Centers to the more Rare. And so the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Place of any Body is when being more Rare it is above more Dens, or being more Dens beneath more Rare, as I have said; or also being among Equidens, whether above, or beneath any other parts therof, yet it is in its Proper Place; becaus it hath such a Natural Fulciment or Center sufficient for it, and there are none more Rare beneath it, through which it may or ought to Move according to this Statike Law of Nature; but the other Equidens Parts whether above, or beneath it, are also in their Proper Sphere, which is the Proper Place of them all, and they can not otherwise be all in one and the same Point. Again I shall observ, that these Spheres being all Rotund, that Spherical Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>undity must be filled, and so the Sphere Completed to render it the Proper Place of those Bodys wherof it is the Sphere, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Bodys will flow or fall every way to fill the Sphere, or any Chasm therin; becaus the lower parts of that Chasm will be beneath, or neerer to the Center of the World then the others; wherefore being Equidens, they will all contend for one Equality or Spherical Community of Situation, which must Equaly relate to the Center, and Circumference of the World. Also heerby it appears that these Spherical greater Bodys do not Move to the Center, nor respect it in Regular <hi>Cylinders,</hi> as less particular Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys, Plummets, or Bullets falling through the Air, which seem to us to Descend in a most Directly Perpendicular Line, and serv for Measures therof well enough, becaus any such requisite Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramidal Confirmity therof to the Center is not discernible by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their smalnes, (as smooth Water in a Pond seems to us Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly Plane, and that <hi>Planities</hi> therof servs well enough to make a Water level) wheras any Quadrant, or Semiquadrant, or the like of those Proportionable greater Bodys respect the Center as Pyramids Inverted with their Cones Downward, and <hi>Bases</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, which is their Exact Conformity therunto, and the way of their Gravitation and Motion of Descent; as we may easily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, if we duly consyder the Relation of any Circumference to the Center. And therefore such Quadrants, and Semiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drants, do not Superpend, nor consequently Superincumb, in such
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:61550:49"/>
their Pyramidal Bases beyond their Cones. Yet I do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv of such Proper Places and Spheres that they are Magical Circles, or any such Phantastical Houses as Astronomers fansy to be in Heaven, but only, as I have said, Proper Localitys of the whole Body of Matter and Extension of such several Spherical Bodys according to the more or less Density and Gravity therof. Much less do I conceiv that the Center hath any such Magical Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue or Attractive Power, nor that it is any Cavity, or the like, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Term which is the Midst, and Inmost Point, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Lowest of the whole Body of the Matter of the World Immovable and Inalterable, and relating to the Circumference ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that is the Utmost <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Superaether, which is Ingene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, Incorruptible, and Invariable, being the Universal Bound and Limit of Nature, and of all Bodys, and of the whole Matter and Extension therof. Having thus premised, I shall now examin the Pressure of the Atmosphere, which is so confidently asserted by some, though evidently there be no such thing, nor can there be any Rational Supposition therof, without a supposed Dislocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Body of the World, and offering Violence to Nature, as I shall now prove. God <hi>Created the Heaven and the Earth,</hi> and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beyond or without them; wherefore certeinly they Press upon nothing, or do not Press Outwardly becaus there is no Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thing to support them, or on which rhey might Press; but only they tend to Union Inwardly. And as the several Spheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Bodys of the Elements do not Press upon the Superaether, nor one upon another Outwardly, so neither Inwardly, as <hi>Iob</hi> saith, <hi>He hangeth the Earth upon nothing,</hi> that is, it doth not hang or Press at all either Outwardly, wherof he spake before, <hi>He stretcheth out the North</hi> which is the most Terreous part of the Globe <hi>over the empty place,</hi> that is, the Air (as a Vessel is said to be Comparatively empty when it is filled only with Air) no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> yet Inwardly, for it hangs upon nothing besides itself on which it might so Press, and it doth not Press upon itself, the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and all the Parts therof being in their Proper Place, as I have said. And heer again, I must clear one Vulgar and common Error, which may be the caus of the contrary Apprehension, that is, That the Earth, and consequently the whole Globe of the World doth Press upon the Center every way, as upon a Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that bears it up; or as two Bodys of equal Spiritual Strength
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61550:50"/>
or <hi>Potentia</hi> Pressing one against another with all their Power, by such mutual Encounter and Resistance do forcible fix and setle each other Immovably in some midle Point between them: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as though there be such particular Combats between Contrary Qualitys, and the like Opponents in Nature, and so there are also particular Dislocations of Members in the Body therof, yet generaly the whole Structure of the Body of the World (and so of the Atmosphere) is so Composed that there is no such Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, which Properly is not Nature but Violence, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent of Heavy Bodys every way to the Center is only as to a Point, or Term, which they do not desire to pass, and therefore do not Press beyond it; and becaus Violence doth not long continue, there is therefore an Innate Principle of Motion in Bodys to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to their Proper Place, whereby they may obtein that Rest which Nature Intendeth, and Abhorreth all such Pressure, Pain, or Burden. And heerin the <hi>Pondus</hi> of Matter and <hi>Potentiae</hi> of Spirits do manifestly Differ; for wheras generaly the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Spirits Act to the utmost, Incessantly, and without any Rest, becaus they are Qualitys of Active Principles (and so the Heavenly Bodys Move Indesinently) the Weight of Matter which is a Passive Principle affecteth Rest, and only tendeth unto it, and when and where it obteineth it, then and there it Resteth, and the Actual Weight and Motion therof is thereby again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to Potentiality, as I have said. And I can not conceiv any Reason nor frame any Notion in mine own Mind why, or how the Body of the World should Press rather or more Inwardly then it doth Outwardly, which is not at all. And if we could suppose any such Pressure, it must be either every way; which would accordingly Press and Squeez or only downward, and then every one of the <hi>Terricolae</hi> should be Pressed Downward with a Proportionable Pyramid of the whole Body of the World so In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted as I have shewed, and according to Mathematical Rule in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging itself from his Head or Back or Hand on which it doth so superpend as the Cone, to the Utmost Circumference of the Superaether as the <hi>Basis:</hi> for it is all Matter, and there is no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent Body Intervening to prevent that Pressure, and so if one part of that Pyramid Press, all must Press: and if we compute the Inestimable Burden therof, it will be found Insupportable, and at the Atmosphere also to be so Comprest in itself, as would render
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61550:50"/>
it no Atmosphere, or fit place of Breathing. But let us descend farther and consyder the midle Point of the Earth and Center of the whole World; certeinly no Poet can Imagin such an <hi>Atlas,</hi> or <hi>Hercules,</hi> as might so bear the whole Burden of the whole Body of the World being farr greater then of the Heavens only, which they feigned them to bear up (though indeed the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Pressure therof be the greater Fiction.) And I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the common Experience of all men, who with their own Hands can feel no such Pressure of the Atmosphere; (wheras it should Press the <hi>Area</hi> of the Hand Proportionably as much as 29 Inches of Mercury) and of every Diver, who can testifie the Nonpressure of the Deepest Water lying upon him: and whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will not accept these for Experiments, but seek to evade them I know not how, he doth plainly thereby Invalidate the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of all Experiment, and render it as Sceptical as some would make both Reason and Faith, since none can be more Sensible and Notorious then this which is by feeling, the Fundamental and least Fallible Sens: But I shall plainly clear by a whole Galaxy of Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments, which I shall therefore collect into this one S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>atike Rule, That in any Body Internaly Consistent in itself, or made Externaly to Consist together, the more Rare Parts therof, being duly placed above the more Dens, do not Actualy Weigh or Press the more Dens Parts below them, nor the Equidens Parts one another Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly. Whereby it shall plainly appear how a Particular Body so disposed is a Module of the Universal Body of the World in this particular respect. Thus in the highest Column of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or Stone, or Coloss of Brass, or Pyramid of Brick, Perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicularly Erected, (as they ought to be) no one Part therof doth Press another, supposing them all to be Equidens, (or only so farr Proportionably as they are not so Equidens) for otherwise all must Press the very lowest and thinest Physical <hi>Area</hi> therof, and then let all the Incumbent Weight be computed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with that <hi>Area,</hi> and the Strength therof, and I suppose the Impossibility of such a vast Weight and Pressure, to be born by by such a slender Fulciment will easily be granted; when we see a whole Brick to be broken and battered only by a Cart-wheel going over it. Again let us consyder other Bodys sometimes Actualy Fluid, and sometimes Consistent; as a Firkin, or any larger Cask of Butter, Tallow, or the like; if it be uncased, and the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61550:51"/>
Upper and Lateral Parts of the Cask taken off from the Mass of Butter, or Tallow; yet it shall stand as firm as it did before, though there is at least an half hundred Weight Incumbent upon the <hi>Area</hi> therof. Wheras if you lay an Equal Plate of Lead or any more Dens Body, of the same Weight upon a thicker <hi>Area</hi> of the Butter, or Tallow, it will not be able to bear it, but be squeezed Outward; becaus the Equidensity and Equiconsistency of all the Parts of its own Body make them all to be at Rest, but the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Density of the Lead doth Press them; and so if the <hi>Cylinder</hi> of Butter or Tallow were much higher, yet the upper Parts would not Press the neather until the Weight therof did overcome the Consistence, as the Lead doth by its Unequal Density. And if the Butter and Tallow were Melted and Fluid in the Cask, and then should be uncased, as before, they would Press and flow every way; but yet while they are conteined Externaly within the Cask, no Part therof doth Weigh or Press another. So in a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern of Water, while it hath no Vent, no one Part of the Water doth Weigh or Press another, nor would Oil, or the like, upon the Water, Press it. But though the Parts in these and the like Cases do not Weigh, or Press one another, yet the Whole Body whether Internaly or Externaly Consistent doth Weigh and Press the next Body beneath it, not Continuous and Consistent with it, or not Equidens. And so a Man bearing the Firkin or Cask doth feel the whole Weight therof, becaus the Parts Weigh accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Whole; and so the Whole doth Press another Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, though the Parts of the same Body in such Cases do not Press one another. As a Pale of Water upon a Mans Head doth Weigh and Press according to the Whole, thougha Fish in the bottom of the Pale under the Water doth not feel any Weight or Pressure therof; becaus the Fish is as a Part therof, and within the Pale, which is the External Term of the Consistence therof; and the Body of the Fish Equidens, or therabout, with the Body of the Water. But if a Body Naturaly Consistent be not Erected Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly, as if a Column of Timber be held Obliquely, then the upper Parts therof do Weigh and Press Obliquely, according to the Obliquity therof; and so if any of the upper Parts do Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, they also do Superincumb-Proportionably. As if a Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid Inverted (and be greater then the Pyramidal Proportion which I before mentioned) or a piece of Timber laid Transversly over
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:61550:51"/>
the Top of another. Which I conceiv also to be the true Reason of the Proportionable Overweight and Advantage by Distances from the Center. But if a Fluid Body broader above then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, be in a Vessel of that Figure, yet the upper Parts being Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens do not Press the lower, becaus they all Rest together upon the Consistent Vessel, and only Press upon it. Again, if the Stopcock of a Cistern, or Gutt of a Water-mill, be opened, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Water hath a Vent, then the Parts above that Vent, being not supported by the Consistence, and in Motion do Press one upon another Proportionably, and issue forth with a force Proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able therunto. And any Parts which Move do accordingly Press, though there may be a Pressure without Actual Motion by an Actual <hi>Nisus</hi> or Endeavour therof, As a Burden upon a Mans Shoulders doth Press upon them, though it doth not Move or Sink farther into them, and so a Weight hanging and not Moving Downward doth Press as well as when it doth Move.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. This is, as I conceiv, the State of the Matter, which was created One Universal Body in the Begining, Extended in itself through its whole Body, and having all its Parts beyond Parts, and so continuing Universaly in the Successive Duration therof, that as the Whole cannot be Extended more or less, so no Part therof can be Divelled and Separated from all the others, and thereby be made another several Body, or less World in itself; nor is any Part therof Annihilated, whereby it should be Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, nor any new Part Created, whereby It should be Augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but as it remains the same Universaly in the Whole Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, so also in the Universal Affections therof, though they were first Generaly, and still may be Particularly Varied, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the several Degrees therof which were Potentialy in itself. And yet the whole Body therof still is and must be the same, having the same Orbicular Figure, and the same Total Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity and Gravity; becaus the whole Matter therof is the same, neither more, nor less, then it was, being all Bounded with the same Circumference and Center; and so as one Elementary Part is made more Dens, or Grave, another is made more Rare, or Light. And all are Bounded with the Superaether, which is Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perelementary, and immutable. And as this Universal State therof can not be Varied so it hath Universal Rest in itself, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:61550:52"/>
this Universal <hi>Status</hi> therof, and can not be Varied by any such Universal <hi>Motus</hi> which might Move the whole World. Also there is a General <hi>Status</hi> or Rest, which is the Station or Position of the Great and General Bodys therof, as they were first Created in the Begining, and afterward Ordered in Six Days; that is, of the Superaether, Aether, Air, Water, and Earth, which can not be Varied Generaly; though Particular Elementary Bodys are, or may be Particularly Varied, by Generation or Corruption: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Extension, Figure, Density, or Gravity therof, are so Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. And yet in these Particular Variations therof the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doth alway observ the Universal and General Law of itself, and of the Locality of its own Body, and of all the Parts therof, by conteining all within the same Circumference and Center; and if any Elementary Part become more, or less, Dens in itself, by Altering the Particular Station therof where it was before, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving it to the General Station, and so if it be Violently Remov'd out of it, restoring it by a Natural Motion or <hi>Nisus</hi> of Restitution and Return therunto. Thus there is a double State or Rest of Matter, that is, either Universaly of Union, or Generaly of fit Station and Position therin; and as the Union is of Extension, so both the Rest and Motion to Union do, as I suppose, subsist in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension: and as the Rest and Motion to Station is to the Center of Gravity, so they both Subsist in Density; which is also Analogous: for as Matter tends to Union with itself and hath thereby some Density in itself; so Dens, or more Matter of less Extension tends to more close Union or more Inwardly within itself. And this Union is the Foundation of the Universal Rest or Aquiescence therof in itself, which it first and most Naturaly affecteth; and of the other of Station which is next unto it, as being Convenient and Conformable to the other. And both these Rests when they are Disturbed are Recovered by that other Subservient Principle in itself, which is the Natural Motion therof. And this Motion is not Actively Contrary to Rest, as Heat to Cold; and the like Contrary Active Quality; for Rest is not Active, but rather Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative or a Not moving in respect to Motion, and only a Positive Acquiescence of the Matter itself, Subsisting in it; as also Motion doth Move unto Rest as another Assistant or Auxiliary Affection therof, and Subordinate unto Rest: (as Verticity is not Contrary, but Subordinate to Polarity, serving only to reduce Magnetike
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:61550:52"/>
Bodys to that fixed Position, which is the Polar Rest therof.) Which Rest Bodys do most Naturaly affect, but being Dislocated or Disturbed, cannot attein it without Motion. And therefore Rest and Motion seem to some to be Contrary, becaus though Motion be to Rest, yet it is in itself Motion, and not Rest, and indeed it is Analogous to that which Moraly is termed <hi>Invita Voluntas.</hi> As when a man goeth a Journey, not willingly in respect of the Journey, and yet willingly in respect to Rest at Home: but as this Rest of Matter is Acquiescence in the Natural Union and Station therof, so Disunion or Dislocation are more Contrary therunto, which yet are not Contrary to the Rest itself, and are rather Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of the Union and Station wherin Rest doth Acquiesce. Nor are any Different Local Motions, Upward, and Downward, and the like, Properly Contrary; but only Localy Advers, or Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite; for they may be both from the same Principle of Motion to prevent Vacuity, and tend to the same Union of the Matter; though they may Vary the Station therof; becaus the Station, which is of Convenience, is also Subordinate to the Union, which is of Necessity. But to affirm that Bodys of Matter are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs Indifferent to Motion or Rest, and so being once put into Motion would Move alway if there were no <hi>Obex</hi> or Impediment, is most contrary to the very Nature of Matter, which would never Move itself if it were not first Removed by others; and of Motion itself, which is only to reduce it to Rest; and to all Sens: for we feel our own Bodys (and so do all other Bodys) as they are Bodys to affect Rest, and return unto it assoon as they may: though while they are Moved by the Active Spirits they can not Rest in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs; but Distinctly consydered in themselvs as Bodys, they are only Passive; and so indeed Naturaly apt to be Moved by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, but not to Move themselvs; and Torpid, having no Activity in themselvs, whereby to resist the Spirits or <hi>Potentiae</hi> therof, but only a Dull <hi>Pondus</hi> or Heavines. And that Natural Affection of Union or Station which is in themselvs is not any such Power or Strength as the Consistence of the Earth, wherof I shall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours heerafter, but only a Stupid Acquiescence in itself. And that very Motion, whereby they preserv their Union, or recover their Station, is only an Infirmity, that is an Inclination unto, and Recumbence of one Body upon another, for a mutual Support; or a Succumbence or Sinking and Falling Downward, for want
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:61550:53"/>
of such Support: which are all Symptoms of Weaknes, and not of any Strength. And all the Motion of Matter is only Local and not Active or Operative in itself, like the Motions of Spirits, but as an Instrument of their Spiritual Qualitys, as I have said. Nor is Local Motion strictly consydered as such in itself either the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Mover, or Passion of the Moved, nor both the Action and Passion of any Automatous Mover and Moved; but the very Moving, or Transition from one Place to another. And thus, <hi>Eo, Curro, Fugio, Volo,</hi> and the like Words of Local Motion, are all of a Neutral Signification, neither Active, nor Passive. And though therupon doth ensue a Variation of the Distance of the Body Moving from or toward all other Bodys in the World, yet its own Motion consydered in itself is only a Variation of its own Locality; and that Body itself only so Moveth, and none other Body is thereby Moved besides itself, (unles it be also Impelled or At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by it otherwise) but Resteth in its own former Locality which it had in the great Body of the World. Otherwise when any one particular Body Moveth, all other particular Bodys in the whole World, and all Parts of Bodys which are thereby Distanced more or less from it, or toward it, or this way, or that way, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Motion of that one Body Moved, should likewise be Moved thereby. And so if Matter and Motion were the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Principles of Generation and Corruption, as some affirm, then by such Motion of any particular Body (which is a Part of the Matter) and of all the Parts and Particles therin, and consequently the Generation and Corruption therof by such Motion, all other particular Bodys, and all the Parts and Particles therof, should be conformably Moved, and consequently so Generated and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted; which doth confound their own Principles. <hi>Oportet esse memorem.</hi> But I do acknowledg that as the Body is the Subject Matter, so also that the Local Motion of the Parts and Particles therof is very Instrumental in Generation and Corruption by Spirits, which are the Movers, Operators, and Architects therof, whereby they make fitt Seat and Officines for themselves; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as otherwise the Body or Matter hath in itself only that Principle of Local Motion, which is to Union and Station, as I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and though Spirits may Vary the Station, yet they can never Vary the Union of Bodys, becaus they are also within the same <hi>Vbi</hi> of the Circumference of the Universal Body of the World, and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:61550:53"/>
the whole Extension therof, which therefore they may not break; or transgress; and they Inhabit in several Stations therof, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Nature of those Bodys which they require; or if they require no Body, as Angels, they may indeed pass through the whole Globe, but can not go beyond it, as I have shewed. But Rest and Motion to this Union and Station are, as I have said, Affections of the Matter Subsisting in it Mediately, but Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately in the other Proper Affections therof; that is, Rest is the Acquiescence of Matter in that Union and Station, and Motion the Tendence of it therunto. Now from this Union or Unition is the Adhesion of Matter which is more Naturaly and Necessarily effected thereby, then by or with any Adamantine Chains or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments whatsoever: for so Nature alway worketh her own Works by her own Natural and Internal Principles, and needeth no such Artificial or Mechanical Hooks and Clasps, and I know not what Intangling, rather then Uniting Figures, which some have vainly Excogitated. Wheras the very Homogeneity of the Matter Inclineth it of itself to Union with itself; and Disconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity is only from Heterogeneous Spirits, as I have shewed, which make several Heterogeneous <hi>Composita,</hi> that are therefore Spiritualy Continuous only in themselvs, and Contiguous one with another; and yet even in them all, the Matter is still Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous to and with itself, as it was before, and so continues to be one Universal Body of the whole World. Nor is this Motion to Union so Powerful in Spirits as it is in Matter, becaus it is not so Necessary in them: yet any Homogeneous <hi>Composita</hi> are not so easily Discontinued or Severed, as Heterogeneous; and therefore have also their Motions of Restitution; and some, as Magnets, do not only Incline, but notably attein this Unition of their Spiritual Homogeneity, wherof I shall Discours heerafter: And now will proceed farther to inquire into the Degrees of the Motion of Matter, and of the Velocity therof. I have said before, that more Matter of less Extension or any Dens Body Moves more swiftly; which is one Internal Cause of the Velocity therof: And so also the more or longer it Moves, it Moves more Swiftly; which is another Internal Cause therof: and it is not only from the External Motion of Restitution in the Air, above, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Bullet, or other Body falling through it, which did Impell and Violently Dimove it, and so when the Bullet is past
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:61550:54"/>
through that Part of the Air, which was so Impelled and Dimoved, it returns smartly again by that Motion of Restitution behind, and upon the Bullet, which may give the Bullet some small Impuls, and so caus it to Move somewhat faster; and then the Bullet Moving faster, Impells and Dimoves the next part of the Air more forcibly, which accordingly increaseth the Motion of the Restitution ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and so causeth the Increments of the Velocity of the Motion of the Bullet. And the Bullet in Descending also Impells and summoves that part of the Air which is beneath, and before it, and that part the next; and so prepares a way, or <hi>Vortex,</hi> for itself, whereby it may more easily, and consequently more swiftly, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend. But, though it be true, that either Addition of Force, or Subtraction of Impediment, may Accelerate Motion, and heer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps both together do concurr, and may somewhat conduce ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; yet I am not so Curious as others, to apprehend, either, or both of these, to be sufficient and the only Causes of so consyde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable an Effect, as the notable Increas of Velocity of Motion in such Descending Body<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; but rather ascribe it to the Internal and Proper Nature of the Motion itself; which being capable of such Degrees in itself (as well as Density in which it doth Subsist) and while the Body was in Rest was only in Potentiality, and no Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Motion, till it began to Move; and as it then begins to Actuate itself, so the longer it continues, it doth still Actuate itself more and more by Degrees in the Natural Motion therof to the Center. And there is no such Increment of Velocity in the Weigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of a Clock moving <hi>Sensim</hi>: Nor is there any Attractive Virtue in the Center itself, as I have said, becaus that is only a Point wherin such Virtue can not Subsist, and only a Term of Locality Downward which God hath Immovably fixed and ordeined so to be, as the Circumference is Upward, and it doth no more Attract Downward then the other doth Upward. And any Equal Weight in the same <hi>Medium,</hi> whether it be placed in a higher, or a lower part therof, Weighs and Moves Equaly, first; and according to the continuance of the Motion, so are the Degrees of Velocity. Nor is it from the Magnetike Virtue of the Earth, for such Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are Proportionably Equal, as I suppose throughout, and not <hi>Per Gradu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

that Natural Motions are Swifter, and V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Which Instance may well prove what I said formerly, That Spiritual Motions are for Motion and Action; but Motion of the Matter is only to Rest; and therefore Slow when the Body is first Removed from its Rest, any Remotion from which it Disaffecteth, and Swifter as it draweth neerer to the next place of Rest, which it Affecteth. Also this plainly sheweth that Motion of Desc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nt is Realy Different from all the former Affections of the Matter, becaus it so Varieth itself, though they continue the same. Now it is also observable that according to the Increas of the Swiftness of the Motion, so is also the Strength of Percussion: for Swiftnes is a Conspissation, or as I may so say Condensation of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and all Conde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sation being an Union doth fortifie. Again, as Motion is an Advantage of Percussion, so it is also of Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration; becaus Penetration is by Percussion; and a Swifter and Stronger Percussion maketh a Swifter and Stronger Penetration: which is observable in Bows, Balists, Catapults, and the like; wherin the quick and smart Delivery maketh the great Percussion and Penetration; and Time is very consyderable heerin; for if the Percussion be so Strong and Swift, that the Body Percussed hath not requisite Time to Resist, it pierceth through it, as if i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> were only a <hi>Medium</hi>; as a Bullet shot Directly through a Bord, or Glass, maketh only a round Hole in it; wheras the same Strength, not so Swift, would make it first Bend and Cleav, or Break, which shew a Partial Resistance. And so if the Percussion be more Swift then Strong, whereby it hath not requisite Time to Penetrate, it will be more Resisted; as a Bullet shot Obliquely will Reflect from Water, or as they say Graze; as also Oister<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shells (wherwith Boys use to make Ducks and Drakes as they call them) wheras in more time they would Sink into the Water. Also all Motions of Percussion or Penetration are Violent as to the Body Percussed or Penetrated, though the other may Move Naturaly, as a Bullet falling through Air, or Water, Naturaly Downward, doth Violently Percuss and Penetrate the Air or Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is thereby Dislocated, and Violently Elevated, as I have said: and it seems to me that even that Motion of the Bullet is also as it were Violent in respect of the Place of Rest from which
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:61550:55"/>
the Bullet first Moveth, which maketh it to be so Slow at first; and only N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tural in respect to the next Place of Rest to which it Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, which maketh it so Swift at last, as I have said: but the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let shot is first put into Motion by the External Impression, and that Motion being wholy Violent is Swiftest at first, and Slowest at last. And yet the Motion continueth Proportionably accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Impression, though that last no longer then the very Contact, and is Discontinued with it. Nor can I conceiv that that there is any Continuation therof, or Magical Line of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, between such a Mover and Moved, as some have fansied: for the Impression, being an Accident, must necessarily Subsist in its own Substance, and can not Migrate into another, nor is the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia</hi> which maketh the Impression Emanant, but Inherent. Certeinly this is a Mystery in Nature, and I know no Instance which doth more seemingly prove a Migration of Accidents, and I suppose the disproving heerof will very much confirm the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Truth. Now, as I have said before, the Matter having Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaly in itself Motion is putt into it, and the Motion Actuated by any Violent Impression; as well as by Natural Tendence to Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Station: and that which is most wonderful heerin is, that the External Impression doth not only Actuate the Motion at first, but Divert the Natural Tendence therof Downward, and Direct it another way. But as I have said, there is in Matter not only a Motion to Station which is Downward; but also to Union, which is generaly Directed by the other Downward, but may be any way; as sometimes it is Upward: and this Motion which is most Natural and Principal, is also the Universal Motion of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and being Diverted, and Directed Violently, by the External Impression, doth carry the Body that way, yet so as it doth only Divert, and not destroy it, or the other Notion of Descent, which more Particylarly is to Station, and that is Particularly also Natural, whereby the Body hath still a <hi>Nisus</hi> and Inclination that way. And the Diversion of the Motion being Violent is, as I have also said, Strongest at first, and the Natural Weakest; and so the Violent Diversion doth overcome the Natural Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Descent, and Proportionably Divert it, as in Flying or Swimming; and while it doth Totaly prevail against the Motion of Descent, carrieth the Body in a Direct Line and Level any other way, though with some Decrement of the force: so that a
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:61550:55"/>
Bullet shot out of a Gun doth not Move with an Equal Force so long as it flys Levell, as may appear by the Unequal Execution that it doth at a neerer or farther Distance within that Levell, and so doth Decreas by Proportionable Degrees: or if it be short Perpendicularly Upward it will Decreas in Swiftnes and Strength till it return again Downward, which is the very Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween such Violent and Natural Motions heerin. And as Rest and Motion are seemingly Contrary, and yet Motion is indeed Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate, and Subservient to Rest, so is the Natural Motion to this Violent Diversion so long as it is Predominant over it. All which I shall manifestly approve by the common Experiment of a Ball Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding from a Paviment of Stone. Certeinly the Ball first falls Perpendicularly upon the Paviment by its own Natural Motion of Descent, which being greater then is sufficient to carry it to its next Place of Rest, and being stop'd by the Stone, is Reflected Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and that is a Motion Diametricaly Opposite to the former, and is by reason of that Diversion and Direction, which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth from the Paviment Externaly, and yet not by any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Impression therof, but only from its own Natural Motion Actuated in itself, and so Diverted and Directed thereby. For the Paviment of Stone, being Consistent and Quiescent, can add no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to it, nor make any such Impression upon the Ball; as an Hand may by throwing or beating it back; or a Racket by the Springi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the Strings, first yielding, and then Repercussing it; nor is there any such Springines in the Ball which falleth upon the Pavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and there is the same Motion of a Marble, or the like most Consistent, and not Springy or yielding Globules. But both the Direct and Reflex Motion are from the Ball or Marble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs, and the Motion therof, as the Emanation of Rays, which are Naturaly Reflexive, aswell as Emanant. And as the Bullet, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o also the Ball, or Marble, by their own Natural Motion so D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, do by Degrees prevail against that Violent Diversion, and at last attein their Natural Rest. And I suppose, that if an Hole were made through the Body and Center of the Earth, and a Bullet drop'd in it, the Bullet would pass beyond the Center forward and backward, like a <hi>Pendulum,</hi> or Needle by its own Motion Actuated in itself, and so by Degrees return to it. Now if the Ball or Marble fall by a Diagonial Declivity, as from a Penthous, Roof, or Hill, or the like; then, becaus it half Rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:61550:56"/>
and half Moveth, that Motion acquireth only half the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, or Degrees of Velocity, and may describe a Quadrant of a Proportionable Cycloid in the Descent afterward upon the Paviment; and as I suppose a <hi>Granado</hi> shot from a Mortarpiece Diagonialy doth from the Angle of Inclination, or <hi>Zenith,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe such a Quadrant between the Perpendicular and Arch of the Circle: which I leav to the Curious more Exactly to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min. And there is the like Reason of the Semicircular Vibrations of the <hi>Pendulum:</hi> wherof the Center of Extension is the Point where the Line hangs, and whereby the <hi>Pendulum</hi> is Produced to the Extremity of the Semidiametrical Plane, where the Arch ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of begineth Downward, and then is let go, but cannot Descend Perpendicularly Downward, becaus the Line which is suspended at the Center doth stop it, and so Divert and Direct its own Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Descent accordingly to describe almost a Semicircle half about that Center, which it plainly doth, without any External Impression or Reflexion from any other Body, but only by its own Natural Motion so Diverted and Directed; and by Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable Decrements, as is aforesaid; (as the Needle of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass doth also so Move Horizontaly by a greater Motion of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticity then is sufficient to reduce it to the Pole) and so at last the Natural Motion prevailing against the Violent Diversion, it Rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Perpendicularly upon the <hi>Nadir</hi> of the Arch which it descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, and is Correspondent to the Center of the Perpendicular Line. And probably such Decrements of Violently Diverted Motions are Proportionable to the Increments of Natural Motion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And perhaps Motions of Restitution, which are Spiritual and from the <hi>Potentia</hi> of Spirits, are heerin Analogous to the Natural Motion of Matter: and so a Spring of Steel beat one way seems to make one Vibration almost as much the other way; and the many V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>brations in the Torricellian Experiment are from such Causes. It may be also inquired, whether there are such Increments of the Natural Motion to Union Upward aswell as to Station Downward, as whether a Bullet which is suck'd up by a mans Breath through a longer Musket barrel doth Ascend more Swiftly and more Strongly, then if it were shorter; or <hi>Per Saltum,</hi> like the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Magnets? for it is by the Sucking and Expanding of the Included Air thereby, which when it is so far Expanded, that the Retractive <hi>Potentia</hi> therof is more Praepotent then the <hi>Pondus</hi> of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:61550:56"/>
the Bullet, and the Air being still suck'd the Bullet doth by the other Motion of Matter to Union, as Naturaly follow it to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Vacuity (which I shall shew heerafter) as if it did Descend by the Motion to Station, or at least equaly as swiftly at last as at first like Aether. And I shall now observ one thing more in such Diverted Motions (which I have before intimated) that if the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petus</hi> or Force therof, which is so Actuated, be greater then can be spent in carrying the Body Moved forward by reason of the Resistance of the <hi>Medium,</hi> or otherwise; then it not only so carry's it Directly, but the Excess therof doth also Move the Body Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly. Thus a Bullet or Arrow discharged Violently from a Gun or Bow, besides the Direct Motion therof, Moves also Circularly. And so in a Whirlpitt which hath a Vent at the Bot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>om, whereby all the Parts of the Water above it are putt in Motion, as I have shewed, and yet can not all Descend and issue out together, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they Move Round, as also Water in a Boiling Pott: and so in the common Experiment of Water Ascending from a Basin, wherin a Flaming Candle or Charcoal kindled at one end is Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly fixed above the Water, and then an Urinal, or the like Vessel Inverted over it into the Water in the Basin, the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will Move Round in the Basin when it begins to Ascend into the Urinal, as may appear by any Motes swimming in the <hi>Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of the Water. And so I conceiv it to be a general Rule, That if a Body in Actual Motion, so farr as it can not, according to the Actual Motion therof Move Directly, the Parts therof will Move Circularly. Now becaus all Circular Motion of the same Body, and in the same Place hath to some seemed so very Wonderful and Inexplicable; I shall heer endeavor to explain it, and grant that which is the very caus of their Wonderment, that is, that all Local Motion is, and necessarily must be, Progressive; becaus it is from Place to Place: but we must also consyder, that such a Circular Motion is Immediately of the Parts, as of the aforesaid Motes in the Water, and accordingly of all the Parts of the Water, Circularly, and consequently of the Whole, Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately thereby: and so the Parts Move Progressively, and Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively, from their several Positions and Places in the Whole, which they have in their own Body, as well as their own Body hath in the Body of the whole World, East, West, North, and South, which is the very Nature of Place, as I shall shew heerafter:
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61550:57"/>
and consequently by them the Whole Moves Circularly also in its Place, wherin it was, and still is; but only is Localy Varied or Moved according to that Variation and Motion of the Parts being itself in the who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e where it was before: and certeinly all the Parts may aswell Move so Simultaneously in Time, and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively and Orderly in Place, as the Motes; and the Motion of the Whole doth thereupon as Naturaly and Necessarily ensue: And so a Planet Moves about its own <hi>Axis</hi> Immediately by the Parts therof, and it Moves about the Sun Immediately by the Whole as a Part of that Circle which it describes Progressively, though in a Line Perpetualy Curv, And in such Motion of a Fluid Body any way, the Parts therof do so farr forth Weigh, Press, or Move, one another: as a Diver shall find in any <hi>Vortex</hi> or Stream, if he oppose himself against the Current therof, but not in any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressive Motion of the Whole as when he swims along with it, which is a Sensible Difference. And this may help also to salv another Difficulty, which hath been esteemed Incomprehensible. How a Body Moving Circularly should Move Round in the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumferential Parts therof in the same Space of Time as in the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical; since the Circumferential describe larger Circles, and Move through a greater Space or Distance of Place then the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical, and yet both by the same <hi>Pondus</hi> or <hi>Potentia.</hi> Wherin we must consyder that the <hi>Pondus</hi> or <hi>Potentia</hi> being Equaly applied to the whole Consistent Body Moved is distributed Equaly to all the Parts, but doth Unequaly Move them according to their Unequal Distances from the Center, whereby the Circumferential being Proportionably more Moved by their Equal share therof, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to those Distances, do Move Swifter, or through Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably larger Circumferences though Simultaneously in the same Space of T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>me, which is an Equality in Inequality; and both are Proportionable to the Nature of the Consistent Body so Moved thereby, and the Distance of the Circumferences therof from the Center. Also there is a Motion of the Whole partly Progressive, and partly Circular, As when a Coach or Cartwheel in going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Moveth Round. And hence hath arose another Problem. How such a larger and a less Wheel being both fixed upon the same <hi>Axis</hi> should Move upon lower and higher Planes with Equal Circumvolutions. Which needeth no such Solution as the former, becaus it is a plain Fallacy: for in such a Position and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:61550:57"/>
Motion the larger Wheel Moves Round by Perfect Circumvoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the less Wheel partly Slides along (as well as Moves Round) so farr as to equal the Circumvolutions of the larger Wheel: for indeed otherwise it were Impossible that one Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution of a less Wheel should Equaly run over so much of the Planes, being both of the same Longitude, as of a larger, becaus their Circumferences are not Equal. And this Fallacy may sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly appear by not fixing, but putting both the Wheels loos upon the same <hi>Axis</hi>; and then you may plainly perceiv the Exact Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the Circumvolutions Proportionably according to the Difference of the Circumferences.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. Local Motion, as I have said, is Transition from Place to Place; and doth therefore import Place; which is Relative, and not only the Position of a Body in its own Extension other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then as the Parts therof are in their Respective Places in the Whole. And therefore no Body is said to be Localy in itself, or in its own Whole Positively, but only Relatively: as we do not say <hi>England</hi> is in <hi>England.</hi> Wherefore also the whole Body of the World is not Properly in a Place, but in its own Position and Extension, which is not Properly a Place Positively in itself, but only Relatively to all the Parts therof, and without it there is no other Body, in respect wherof it may be said to be in such a Place. Nor is Place the <hi>Superficies</hi> of other Bodys Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bient; for not only the whole Body, but every Part within the <hi>Superficies</hi> of itself is also in a Place, which, as I have said, it Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth in a Circular Motion of the Whole, and yet the Whole is in the same Place and Vicinity of Bodys: and so is also every Point therof in a Place according to its own Proper Nature, that is, as it doth Coexist with others, and so Commove with them; so it is also Collocated with them, though not severaly by itself alone: wherefore also the <hi>Superficies</hi> of its own Body is not the Place therof, nor indeed can it be so many several Places: but as Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension hath Part beyond Part, which therefore is not one and the same Position of every one Part severaly in itself, becaus eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one hath a several Position in itself; so the Place therof is the Relation of one to the other in the Whole, or as it is Beyond, farther, or neerer, heer, there, and the like; which is not only a Notional Relation, as First and Last in Extension, but Real; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:61550:58"/>
Extension hath Realy Part beyond Part, as well as Time hath Realy Part after Part, as I have formerly shewed. And so Circumference and Center are Real Relations of Extension, and there are Real Advantages of more or less Distance of any Parts from the Center, as I have said. Now according to this Real Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, a Body is said to be in such a Place or Part of the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the World, and not in another: And if the whole Globe of the World were a Magnet, it should have a North and South Pole in respect of its own Parts, and so all the other Points of the Utmost, or any other Inner Circumference therof, though there be no Body beyond it to which they may so Point. And so <hi>England</hi> is said to be in such a Part of the World, and not in another; and <hi>London</hi> in such a Part of <hi>England</hi>; and not in another; and so of any less Bodys, as the Parts therof are Relatively Distant more or less from the other Parts of that Body, or of the whole Body of the World, or their Situation any way Varied. Again, as there are such Real Places, so also certein Real Stages and Posts, which God hath Realy fixed in the World, as the Circumference and Center of the whole Body of the World, according to which any Part or Particular Body therof is said to be Higher, or Lower; that is, more Outward or Inward, and two Poles of the Earth wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the <hi>Axis</hi> doth Intersect the Center by one determinate Line ending in two certein Points, and so directing it, and thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining North and South, and consequently all the Points of the Compass. And so there are also two Opposite Circumvolutions of Aether and Aethereous Bodys, which Denominate East, and West, in all such Circumvolutions, one way, or other, as I shall shew heerafter. And according to these Real Differences I suppose all the several Localitys and Motions of any other Bodys in the World, (which may be as Various as all Mathematical Figures) may be Determined and Denominated. Also becaus all Spirits whether Material or Immaterial are within the whole Body of the World which no one of them can Possess, or fill, or be Coextended with it all; therefore they are in some Definite Place, or <hi>Vbi</hi> therof, and not in another, according to that Proper Place of the Matter which they Possess; though Matter itself be only in such a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Place Circumscriptively and Extensively, becaus it only hath Extension of itself; and Spirits and Spiritual Qualitys by being Localy therin do acquire such a Definitive Coextension therwith
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:61550:58"/>
and thereby; which Coextension is the <hi>Commune Vinculum</hi> of Matter and of all Spirits, whereby such are Immaterial, and do not Consubstantiate Matter, nor Inhere in it in <hi>Staetu Conjuncto,</hi>

Light beyond all my Probations: wheras some, becaus they do not Distinguish between Extension and Coextension, therefore Confound Bodys and Spirits, and so, becaus they do not distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish between Extension and Matter, therefore Confound Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances and Accidents, and becaus they do not distinguish between Extension and Vacuity, therefore Confound Entity and Nonen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity. And though they will not allow Spirits to be in the Body of Matter, and the Coextension therof to be their <hi>Ubi,</hi> yet they can Suppose Matter itself and the very Extension therof to be in some other <hi>Vbi,</hi> or somthing which they call Space, and which must either be another Extension without a Body, or the same, or Nothing: though, as Position is only a particular Consideration or Notion of Extension (as the Body or any Part therof is in its own Extension) so Space is only another Particular Consyderation or Notion of Extension, as the Body or any Part therof is in so much of that Extension: and neither of them are Realy any Things in themselvs Absolutely, as Extension, or Relatively, as Place; and though these are such particular Notions of Somthing Real, that is of Extension: yet Vacuity consydered in itself as no Extension of Matter can not be so much as any Notion whatsoever of any thing Real: for then it should be Space which Realy is the same with Extension of Matter, wherof it is only such a particular Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Wherefore they must conceiv it to be another Extension with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Matter; or, as I may so say, another Imaginary Extension of Extension, or that wherin both the Matter and also Extension therof is; and so we may proceed Infinitely: but all such Process Infinite is most Contrary to Finite Nature and to all Philosophy; becaus, as I have said, it is only the vaine Reduplication in Terms of the same Thing in itself. Now if Matter and Extension were one and same, then Matter needeth none other such Imaginary Extension, or Vacuous Space, wherin it may be Extended, becaus it is Extended in itself, otherwise it should not also be Extension: or if Matter be the Substance, and Extension the Proper and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable Accident and Affection therof, then also it needeth none other such Imaginary Extension, or Vacuous Space wherin it may be Extended; becaus it is Extended by its own Extension. Wherefore Vacuity is neither Matter, nor Extension, nor any Real Relation, nor Notion therof, nor indeed any Thing, or Entity whatsoever, but meerly Nothing or Nonentity, wherof it is only a
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:61550:59"/>
particular Consyderation or Notion; as Nullity or a <hi>Cyphar</hi> is of Number, or Nontime of Time; and the like Improper Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finites, wherof I have formerly discoursed. Nor is it any Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive founded in Positives, which thereby Complexively may be Consydered, and seem to be Somthing, but a particular Negative, and the very Negation of that which is the Respective Affirmative Being, that is, both of Matter and Extension: and so it is neither Long, nor Short; Broad, nor Narrow; High, nor Low: having no Longitude, Latitude, or Profundity; otherwise it should be the same with Extension; which we all acknowledg, and should not differ about Terms: but as consydered severaly from it, it is Nothing, and Notfinite, and so consydering it I need not disprove it, for it plainly proves itself not to be; being only a Negation, which is its own Denial of what any would Affirm or Imagine it to be: and so <hi>Vacuum est Non ens,</hi> or <hi>Vacuum Non est,</hi> or <hi>Non est Vacuum,</hi> are tantamount. Yet becaus some are so fond of it, that not only like Lovers they feign it to be that which it is not, but I think would almost like Paracelsians Create it to Be by their own Imagination therof, I shall briefly argue against it. And certeinly there is no such Vacuity, becaus God himself never Created it, nor indeed can he; becaus it is a Nonentity, which is not Creable, but, as I have before shewed, the very Negative Term from which Creation doth commence, and which doth necessarily Caus that to Be which it Creates; becaus Being is the other Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative Term of Creation, which is from Not being to Being. And wheras it is commonly demanded, Whether God could not Possibly have Created two or more Worlds having Such a Space or Distance one from another, or one Part of this World having such a Space or Distance from another? I answer, He might; if he did also Creute such a Space or Distance (which as I have shewed, is Realy Extension) without any Body or Matter, which I suppose they who ask the Question, and any Materialists them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs will not so easily grant, and they who affirm the Extension itself to be one and the same with the Matter, wherof it is the Extension, must by granting it, deny it, and so Contradict themselvs: for then that Extensive Space or Distance must also be Matter. The Philosophers Reason against Vacuity, That then two Body<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:61550:60"/>
which may Disterminate them, be between them; is so very true and Cogent, that I profess to dispute no farther with him who shall deny it, until he can shew me the Fallacy, or Infirmity, therof. Sensible Experiments against it are manifold; and there is such a Constellation therof in the whole Sphere of the Universal Nature, that I shall collect them all into one Statike Rule, that is, no Weight nor Power can wholy Remove any Body out of the present Place therof (though it may Rarefy or Expand it and so Exue part therof) unles another Body may Succeed: and if it do so Remove any Body, another doth Naturaly and so must Necessarily Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. As let Air be suck'd out of a Bladder the Sides therof will Proportionably Approach, and at last Close together; and if by an Airpump or <hi>Expansor</hi> the Operation should be so Strong as exceed the Consistence and Strength of the Glass, such an Exucti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would also break the very Receiver. Now certeinly there is no other Caus or Reason of the Adhesion of the Air to the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or Glass (which are Heterogeneous, and therefore Disconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Spiritualy) but only the Continuity of Matter and Motion therof to Union, as I have said: which is to prevent Vacuity, or any Discontinuity of the Universal Matter. So in a <hi>Siphon,</hi> though the overweight of Water in the longer Leg be requisite, yet the Motion of Descent by the Gravity doth not otherwise Caus so great a weight of Water in the shorter Leg to Ascend then only by its own Natural Decession whereby the other doth as Naturaly Succeed, as may appear if any Ai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And Air Rarefied by Flame in a Glass, though much Lighter, Draweth up Water, which is Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier,

by being again Condensated in itself by Cold after the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of the Flame or Fire, whereby it occupys a less Space; and the Water doth Succeed it, and Ascend as Naturaly to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Vacuity as it doth Descend in a Whirlpitt; Yea as I have shewed this Motion to Union is most Natural and Predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, even over Motion to Station, and no Body can Move any way in the whole Orb of Matter by any Private Motion whatsoever, unles the Universal Body therof be first Completed. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the whole Body of the World is, and must be, as I have said, Orbicular; not only becaus the Superaether is most Rare, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I suppose most Fluid: and all Fluidity doth Naturaly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>globate, as I have before shewed: but though we should suppose it most Dens, and Firm or Consistent, yet it must be Perfectly Globous; becaus that is the Proper and only Perfect Figure of Union, to which this most Natural Motion to Union of the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

Now as all Sens doth militate against Vacuity, so I know no Sensible Experiment which hath ever yet been offered to prove it, but such as when Vacuists themselvs have farther consydered it, they have at last found therin some Plenitude, which they did not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern at first: and I very much wonder how ever any man first fansied such a Vacuity other then as a Notion of such a part<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Having thus Consydered Matter as it is in itself, with the Corporeal Quantity or Extension, and other Accidents or Affections therof, whereby only we can know it, as we may Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits by their Spiritual Qualitys; let us now so Review it simply as it is in itself, with all the Accidents or Affections therof, and severaly and distinctly from any Spirit or Spiritual Quality what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:61550:61"/>
wherof I shall discours heerafter, and see if we can make of itself alone, or with all its own <hi>Apparatus,</hi> any such Spirit or Spiritual Quality, as some would Produce out of it, and the Atoms or Corpuscles therof: wheras it is in itself only one Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Homogeneous and most Intire Body, which though it hath Aggregate Atoms and Corpuscles in its own whole, Mathematica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet there are indeed no such Segregate Atoms or Corpuscles therof Physicaly as they do Imagin, nor can any such Possibly be without Intervening Vacuity, which we have sufficiently disproved. And therefore the Antient Atomists did also hold Vacuity, and so their Doctrine, though most fals, yet was more Consistent in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, then the other of our Modern Corpuscularians, who affirm Segregate Corpuscles of Matter, and yet no Vacuity, but other Matter Intervening, which is a plain Contradiction or Matter Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate, and not Segregate: and that Segregation therof which they pretend is only the Discontinuity of the Bodys of several <hi>Composita</hi> by their Individual Spirits, which are Heterogeneous, and not by the Matter, which is one Homogeneous and Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Body in itself, as I have said; and even Heterogeneous <hi>Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sita,</hi> which are Spiritualy Discontinuous, are yet Materialy as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuous, as Homogeneous: And so polished Metall and Marble, Drops of Water and Glass, Brick and Mortar, cannot be Divelled or Discontinued, unles Air or other Matter may Succeed to prevent Vacuity, and supply the Continuity of the whole Body of Matter and Extension therof; which is Absolutely Necessary: and the Spiritual Continuity of any <hi>Compositum,</hi> which is Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and Corruptible, is only Respectively Requisite for the preservation therof, and whereby it doth Continue its own Body, as much, and as long as it can, and defend itself from other Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bient Bodys, which do Besiege and Assalt the Spiritual Qualitys therof, with their Heterogeneous Spiritual Qualitys; and by the Menstruous Power therof enter and Corrupt it if they can: wheras if there be any Discontinuity in the Matter of the Bodily <hi>Compositum,</hi> the next Ambient Bodys, whatsoever they be, do and must Immediately Succeed to Complete the Great Body of Matter, which can suffer no Discontinuity, as I have shewed. And yet we will afford them such Materials as they would have, that is, supposed Segregate Atoms or Corpuscles, and then let them Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and Confabricate them as they please into any Body, having
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:61550:61"/>
Longitude, Latitude, and Profundity; that is, Corporeal Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; yet certeinly this will be only Matter so Extended, and no other thing whatsoever, either Aether, or Air, or Water, or Earth, or Tree, or Brute, or Man, or Angel. And this Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Matter itself will only, as I have said, be Orbicular, for though all other Figures be in Extension Potentialy, yet any Variation from this most Homogeneous Figure of Union is by the Heterogeneity of Spirits, and the Plastike Virtue therof, which as the Architect or Statuary doth superinduce them, by Varying that one Universal Figure of the Matter. And yet we will also allow them, without any Spirits or Spiritual Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>alitys, to Mold the Matter into what Figure they please; which will be none other then Matter so Figured and Effigiated, and only as so many Statues of Elements, Vegetatives, Sensitives, and Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligences, but not the Things themselvs. Also though all Matter be Equidens in itself, and consequently Equigrave, and the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations therof only superinduced in it by the Spirits, and are therefore by some termed Qualitys, yet we will allow them to Densify or Rarify, Gravitate, or Levitate, those Statues as they pleas; which will be made thereby no other then they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; but only more Dens, or Rare, Grave, or Light. And lastly, though all Matter doth Naturaly affect Rest, and all the Natural Motion therof is only to Rest, as I have shewed, when it is at any time Violently Removed and Dislocated by Spirits or Disturbed by their Spiritual Operations; yet we will also allow them all the Motions of Matter, that is only Local Motions; and then let them either Move their whole Statues or any Parts, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puscles, or Atoms therof, this way, or that way, or every way, as they please; and make them as Automatous as they can sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them to be Moved by or with any such Local Motions: yet as the whole Statues Moving Upward, or Downward, Progressively or Circularly, and the like, will only be Statues; so every one of their Parts, Corpuscles, or Atoms, so Moving therin, will be only such Parts, Corpuscles, or Atoms therof, as they were before; and so consequently the Whole also the same as it was before; only with such Variations of the Local Motion of the Matter or Parts therof, and of other Affections of the Matter, as of Gravity Levity Density and Rarity producing those Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Motions, or of Figure and Extension produced thereby, but
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:61550:62"/>
still the Statues will be only Matter, having such or such Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, Figure, Density, Rarity, Gravity, Motion, or Rest, and the like Affections of Matter: which are Formaly in themselvs and all together only such as they are, and render the Matter only such or such a Statue: but can induce no Spirits and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Qualitys; Heat, Cold, Moisture, Drines, Vegetation, Sensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Intellection; which, as I have said, are formaly in themselves other things farr Different from Matter, and any or all the Affections therof: and so I shall more particularly prove them to be in my following Discourses: though I have already acknowledged, that as Matter is the Body of Spirits, so all the Affections therof are the instruments of Spiritual Qualitys and their Operations, and so as I have said before (though now I have admitted it to be otherwise only by way of Supposition) they are superinduced in the Matter by the Spirit, to make it a fitt Hous and Work hous for itself, and then they both dwell and Work therin; and so Spirits are Instrumental to Matter, and Matter to Spirits. But yet as when I see a Ship sailing upon the Sea, and steering her Cours according to the Art of Navigation, with her Sails spread, Tackling, and Rudder, and the rest of her Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture rightly Instructed and Gubernated, I may not therefore conceiv that she can thus perform the Voiage of herself, and by all those Instrumentalitys, but that as she was first thus rigged and fitted by men, so she hath still men abord who thus guide her, though I may not see them upon the Deck; So when I Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the Active Operations of the several <hi>Composita,</hi> I know that the Rude and Common Matter could never so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ffigiate and Diversify itself, but that the Spirits did so Prepare it for themselvs, and that they still do Act it and Operate in it. Also I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, that therefore there is not only some Correspondence and Analogy between all Created Nature as it is one Univers and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publike; but more or less between all the several Creatures, as I have observed, to be between all Quantitys: and so there is also between all the Affections of Matter among themselvs, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise between Matter, and the Affections therof, and Spirits, and their Spiritual Qualitys, which are all conteined within the same Extension of the whole Body of Matter, and the several Figures therof are the Hieroglyphical Images of the Various Spirits, and may have some kind of Signature therof: and so Condensation is
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:61550:62"/>
Analogous to Intension, and Rarity to Remission of Qualitys, and <hi>Pondus</hi> to <hi>Potentia,</hi> and the rest; but especialy Motion is Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gous to the very Activity of Spirits; and yet as Matter and Spirit, so all Material and Spiritual Accidents are Genericaly Different, and particularly Local Motion from the Active and Generative or Corruptive Motion of Elementary Spirits; and much more from Vegetation, Sensation, and Intellection, which are Motions of a farr other Nature, as I shall shew heerafter. Again, as Matter and Material Accidents are not, nor can not be Formaly the very Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and Spiritual Qualitys, so neither are they Potentialy as others have supposed, and so would Educe them all out of I know not what <hi>Potentia Materiae,</hi> and some Christian Philosophers in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance therwith have supposed the first <hi>Chaos</hi> to be only such a <hi>Materia Prima</hi>; though God saith expresly that in the very Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he Created Heaven and Earth, Comprehending Superaether and all the fower Elements, as I have said; and that the Matter had not only, as a <hi>Materia Prima,</hi> the first and common Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons therof, that is, one Extension, one Orbicular Figure, Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>density, and Equigravity, and the like, but particular Diversifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Variations of Spheres, of several Figures, Densitys, and Gravitys, and the like: and the Superaether then probably was Created Perfect, and adorned with all the Furniture therof, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it is: and the Elements were Created in such a maner as did Denominate them Aethereal, and Aereal Heavens, Earth, and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, (yea the very Heavens and the very Earth, as some have Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caly observed) though Inform, and Inane, and without Motion, which is Secondary and Subordinate to Rest, and wherof there was no Need nor Use before Generation and Corruption were Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined afterward in the Six Days.

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:61550:64"/>
But I presume rather, that as God made all things for himself, and the manifestation of his own Glory to his Intellective Creatures, Angels, and Men, so Angels were Created in the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in and with their Native Region of the Highest Heaven, that they, who can Intuitively behold all things, and needed no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Light to Inspect the Dark <hi>Chaos</hi> (and so I suppose, the whole World and Frame of Nature is Transparent to them) might Contemplate all the Works of God in the Improper Creations of the Inferior Elementary World; which was to be the Region of Man, as he, who is the other Intelligence, was made last, to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view (as God himself afterward did) all the Works which he had made, and to celebrate that Sabbath of Rest which God Instituted, and as it is said, made for him. And as the Divine Spirit was the only Creator, and Angelical Spirits no Subcreators; so much less was there, or is there, any such <hi>Archaus Faber,</hi> or <hi>Plastes, Demiurgus,</hi> or <hi>Demogorgon,</hi> or I know not what Fictitious Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, which some have substituted. And though there be, as I have said, one Universal Body of Matter, or <hi>Corpus Mundi</hi>; yet there is not therefore one Universal Spirit, or <hi>Anima Mundi,</hi> as others have fansied: for then all had been Perfected in the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, both the whole Body, and Spirit of the World; and all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Generation and Corruption had commenced from thence, and should so have continued; and there had needed no such far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther several Creations in the Six several Days, for setting in Order the several Courses therof; from which they did Originaly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence, and so have continued: Wheras though the Matter be one Homogeneous Body, yet the Spirits are many and several, and their Spiritual Qualitys Contrary one unto another, which cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from one and the same Principle; but plainly discover several Spiritual Principles therof: as I have shewed. And though they are United together in one <hi>Compositum,</hi> as in a Beast, or the like; yet they remain several Spirits in their own Natures, as they were before, Elementary, Vegetative, and Sensitive Spirits; and were not, nor are not, made one Universal Spirit of that one <hi>Compositum</hi>; much less is there any such Universal Spirit of all the several <hi>Composita</hi> in the whole Body of the World. And more apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Man, besides all these, there is also an Intellective Spirit, which is farr different from all, or any of these. So that Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caly there is no such Universal Spirit, which is only one in Nature,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:61550:64"/>
as Matter is one, whereby the whole Body and Spirit of the World should be one <hi>Individuum,</hi> but only Metaphysicaly, and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricaly, as there is one Univers, and as Spirit is another Active Principle, or Substantial Activity, and so common to all Spirits, (though Specificaly Heterogeneous in themselvs) wherin they all agree, and which doth Subsist in them all, as a Real Relation of all their Substances so agreeing and Relating, which yet are so Heterogeneous and several in themselvs; but not as any Total Substance in itself, like Matter, and wherof they are all only so many Parts, like the Particular Bodys of Matter. Neither is there any such <hi>Potentia Materiae</hi> which may be the Universal Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of all <hi>Spirits</hi>; nor are they only Diversifications of the Matter, or of any, or all the Affections therof, as I have shewed. And there are Immaterial Spirits of Angels, and Men, Separate, or Separable, from the Matter (otherwise, then as they are in the <hi>Ubi</hi> of the Universal Body therof, which is only a Locality, or Local Circumstance, and not the Formality of their Spiritual Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) and so neither is Consubstantiation of the Matter the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality of Spirits, which we therefore call Material, (as we call some <hi>Animals</hi> Corporeal) and might as well for the same Reason call their Bodys of Matter Spiritual as it is said <hi>There is a Spiritual Body,</hi> and yet even these are Spirits Genericaly as well as Angels, though they are Farr Inferior to them Specificaly; becaus Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are Specificaly Heterogeneous, and may thus differ; though Matter be Homogeneous, and only one and the same. Nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is there or can there be any such <hi>Potentia,</hi> either of Matter, or Spirits, whereby they may Produce any Substance; which is never Potential, but always Actual: because it alway Subsisteth in itself, and therefore cannot be Produced out of Potentiality into Actuality; (but only by Mistion or Union in a Substantial <hi>Compositum</hi>) not like Accidents, which may be Potential; becaus they can Subsist in their Substances, when they are not Actualy in themselvs, nor are they like the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And so in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation of Matter and Spirit, the Matter doth no more Produce the Spirit, then the Spirit doth the Matter; as also in Accidental Composition of several Accidents, one Accident doth not Produce the Essence of another. Thus the true <hi>Potentia</hi> of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:61550:65"/>
the Matter is only the Power of Producing its Proper Accidents, or Affections, out of its own Substance; as Spirits also do theirs out of their own Substances: And yet though the General Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, or Affections, of Matter be Produced out of itself, the Particular D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>versifications therof Instrumentaly are Superinduced by the Spirits, as I have shewed: whereas an Immaterial Spirit, as an Angel, Produceth his own Accidents, or Affections, not only out of his Substance but by it alone, and without any Matter; And Matter, which is otherwise more rightly said to be Receptive of all Spirits Extrinsecaly, is not therefore Productive of them Intrinsecaly. Nor indeed could both Matter and Spirits Produce either themselvs, or one another, or their own Accidents or Affections, or any Thing whatsoever, Properly without a Proper Creation, nor Improperly out of their <hi>Chaos</hi> of Potentiality, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out out an Improper Creation; nor do any Substances now Produce any Accidents, or Substantial or Accidental <hi>Composita</hi> Naturaly, or by Natural Generation and Corruption, otherwise then by the Successive Power and Virtue of the first Institution therof, and Divine Benediction by the Spirit of God; who so Created them, both by a Proper and Improper Creation, as I have shewed; whereby the Cours of Nature, and of all Natural Generation and Corruption, doth continue accordingly. But this Original Generation, which was a Secondary and Improper Creation, did commence from the First and Proper Creation, by the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Preparation and Predisposition of the <hi>Chaos</hi> by the Divine Spirit: and as it was not Immediately from Nonentity, so neither from Corruption; becaus there was yet no such Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated <hi>Compositum</hi> which might be Corrupted; but there were only the Simple Essences of Substances and Accidents Created in the Begining in the <hi>Chaos</hi> of their Potentiality, and Produced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Actuality afterward, wheras Natural Generation doth alway commence from Corruption of some former <hi>Compositum</hi>; which if it should still remain as it was before Generated, there could not be any new Generation of another; and therefore it doth neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily require and presuppose such a Corruption therof.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Thus the <hi>Potentia</hi> of Matter, or Spirits, is only the Power of Educing somthing Subsisting in themselvs, and apt to proceed and flow from them, out of Potentiality into Actuality; as I have
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:61550:65"/>
often said, and shall now prove, when I have first explained my Terms.

                  </gap>t in some others; and therefore alway is Essentialy, though not Existentialy. And when the Essence is Produced out of that Potentiality into the Actuality, then there is a Generation therof; and when again that Actuality is Reduced into the Potentiality, then there is a Corruption therof, But Simple Substances which subsist in themselvs, therefore always are Actualy in themselvs; and are Ingenerable, and Incorruptible: Thus in the Begining there was not only the Matter, nor only the Spirit of the Superaether, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualy Subsisting, but also of Aether, Air, Water, and Earth; which did so Denominate those first Elementary <hi>Composita</hi> of the Matter and their several Spirits, the Heavens, and the Earth, as I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And so there were also in them, and with them, all the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial Simple Vegetative, and Sensitive Spirits, Subsisting Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aly in themselvs; though there were yet no such Mist <hi>Composita</hi> of the Elements themselvs as afterward which might Denominate them Stone, Metall, and the like; nor any Composition of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Spirits with the Vegetative, or of Elementary and Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive with Sensitive, which might so Denominate them Trees, Beasts, and the like; untill such <hi>Composita</hi> were Produced in the Six Days afterward. And so also there were all the Intrinsecal Created Essences, or Entitys, of Simple Accidents, aswell as Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, which were also Created together in the Begining, in and with their Substances, though only the Universal Accidents of Matter, Extension, Orbicular Figure, Density, Rest, and the like, did then Actualy and Extrinsecaly Exist in the Matter; and there were yet none of those Particular Variations therof, which were afterward superinduced by the Spiritual Qualitys of Spirits; becaus those Spiritual Accidents did not yet Exist themselvs: and so not only Substantial <hi>Composita,</hi> but also such Simple Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents were in their <hi>Chaos</hi> of Potentiality.

And as all these Mistions, Compositions, Figures, and Virtues, which were afterward Produced in the Six Days, were Potentialy in this first General <hi>Chaos</hi>; so every thing now in the Cours of any Generation, or Corruption, while it is in Potenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, is so farr forth in the Particular <hi>Chaos</hi> therof; and when it is Actuated, is Produced out of it: and there is no other difference heerin between them, but that the first Production was by the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Power of the Divine Spirit, and the others by the Power of Instituted Nature, or Application of Art: so that this Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality is not Relative to Essence, or Entity; as if it were only a
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:61550:66"/>
Possibility of something, which yet hath no Essence, or Entity, in any maner whatsoever; but only to Actuality of the Essence, or Entity, therof, which is not yet in such a maner as Potentialy it may be, not only by Divine Power, which may Create it Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, or Improperly, but according to the ordinary Cours of Nature, or Art, which may so Generate it Naturaly, or Artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aly. And so the Existence itself or this Realy Dif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erent maner of Being is an Entity, Potentialy in the Essence before it Exists, and Actualy when it doth Actualy Exist. And whatsoever is not so Actualy Existent must necessarily Be before in the Essence therof Potentialy; otherwise it could never be Produced, or made Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aly to Exist by any Power of Nature, or Art. And these Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences, or Entitys, which are yet in their <hi>Chaos</hi> of Potentiality, do then Actualy Exist, when, as I may so say, they come forth upon the Stage of Nature, and there Appear, and Act, or might so Appear, and would so Act, if there were no Violent Impediment; as Accidents, which are the Emissarys and Instruments of Spirits, do Exist, when they are Actualy so Emitted and Instructed, and consequently Actuated, whereby the Spirits of Sensible <hi>Composita</hi> do Immediately Act or Operate upon our Senses, or Sensitive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultys; which are also Accidents, and thereby Mediately upon our Substantial Spirits: and yet there may be such a Violent Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment whereby like Substantial Spirits which always Exist, though sometimes Latent, they may not so Appear, and Act, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, or upon us, though they Exist Actualy in themselvs; as a Picture under a Curtain, or the like. And so there may be also an Erupturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Endeavour, which we call <hi>Nisus,</hi> when they can not Appear, and Act, as otherwise they might, and would, by reason of some more immediate Obstruction (like Retention by any Spontaneous Power with some Strife and Difficulty) which plainly shews them to be so far Actual; becaus there is no Actual Contention of or between any Accidents, while they are in Potentiality, though their Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Natures be most Contrary one to another. And I conceiv that all Mistion, and Contemperature, of Contrary Qualitys, is first begun, while they are in the <hi>Chaos</hi> of their several Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialitys; as they were so Prepared and Predisposed by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit in the Universal <hi>Chaos,</hi> as I have before shewed, and then there being no Actual Contrariety between them, they are easily Mist at first, and so by Degrees, are more and more Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aly
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:61550:67"/>
Mist, as their Contrary Essences are more and more Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated and Produced into Existence by a mutual Contemperation, and Gradual Process therof. Thus I have more largely explained what I intend by Actuality and Potentiality; becaus the right Understanding therof is, as I conceiv, and shall shew heerafter, the Fundamental Knowledg of the whole Doctrine of Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Corruption. And now I shall proceed to prove it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly: It is said of the first <hi>Chaos,</hi> that it was Inform, and and Inane, without any of those Actual Mistions, Compositions, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, and Virtues which were afterward Produced in the Six Days; wherof all the Essence or Entity was Created in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining; and which to Produce were the several Works therof: but there were all the Simple Essences and Entitys therof Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialy in that <hi>Chaos,</hi> otherwise they had not been Created in the Begining, nor had it been such a <hi>Chaos</hi> therof, Inform, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane, in respect of those Essenses, which it had in itself Potentialy, and ought to have Actualy also Existent, but yet had not, and which were afterward Produced into their several Actualitys, and Existences, in the Six Days; wherin there was no Proper Creation of any new Essence or Entity (but only of the Spirit of Man as I shall shew afterward) and the Improper Creations therin were only the Productions of these Potentialitys into their Actualitys by the supernatural Power of the Divine Spirit, which was the Original Institution of Natural Generation and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as I have often inculcated, and shall now declare by a more particular Enumeration. Thus in the first Day Light was Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced out of Aether (wherin it was Potentialy before) by the Mistion therof, into Actuality; and there was no new Creation of the Essence or Entity therof: and therfore it is said, <hi>Sit,</hi> or <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ista<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the Second Day Vapors, which were no new Created Substances, or Essences, but only Water Rarified, did Ascend out of the Water into the Air; and the Qualitys of the Air, or <hi>Expansum,</hi> were Probably then Produced by the Mistion therof. And in the Third Day the Waters and Earth were Distributed, and Disposed, and Drines, Moisture, and Probably the other Qualitys therof Produced by
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:61550:67"/>
the Mistions therof. And in the Fourth Day the Sun and Moon and Starrs were made of the Aethereal Substance, and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably all the Qualitys therof Produced. And in the Fifth Day the Water is said to bring forth or Produce Fishes; and so also Fowls were Produced accordingly. And in the Sixth Day the Earth is said to Produce Beasts, which could not be so Produced in their <hi>Composita,</hi> unles they were there before in all their Simple Essences, or Entitys, which were all Created in the Begining. And in these Six Days there were both Compositions and Mistions, or <hi>Formae Mistorum,</hi> and also Simple Substantial Spirits which were before Created in the Begining were then Produced, as is expressly Interpreted afterward of them all, and their Improper Creation or Making, that he <hi>Rested from all his Works which God Created, and made</hi>; or Originaly, <hi>Created to Make,</hi> that is, Created in the Begining to Make or Perfect afterward in the Six Days. And the Apostle like a Divine Philosopher doth also so Interpret it, <hi>Through Faith we understand that the Worlds were framed by the Word of God; so that things which are seen were not made of things which do Appear:</hi> that is, the <hi>Secula</hi> or Generations were so Framed and Ordered by God in the First Institution therof, that in all Successive Generations no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing should be made of any former <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> or things which do Appear, by any Transpeciation or Conversion therof into other Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences or Entitys, but of their own Essences or Entitys, which he Immediately Created in the Begining, and in their first <hi>Chaos</hi> of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiality, wherin they then were not any such Actual <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> or Appearances, but were made to be such afterward, and so still continue to be Generated out of their Potentiality into Actuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Which as every Christian understandeth by Faith, according to this Divine History of the Creation, and first <hi>Chaos</hi>; so also any Heathen, who wisely consydereth the same Cours of Successive Generation and Corruption, must acknowledg to be according to Natural Reason, and Sen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. And as the first Universal <hi>Chaos,</hi> so every Particular Successive <hi>Chaos,</hi> is Hebraicaly called Gods Treasury, or Storehous, out of which he Produceth or bringeth forth all things Generable, or Corruptible, Expending and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying them in their Appearances and Operations, which is their Actual Use and Office: and so we read of his Treasures of Rain, Snow, Hail, Wind, and the like. And the Author of <hi>Esdras</hi> saith particularly of the Light, which was first so Produced: <hi>Then
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:61550:68"/>
commandedst thou a fair Light to come forth of thy Treasures, that thy Work might Appear</hi>; that is, to Exist Actualy, which before was Latent in the <hi>Chaos</hi> of Potentiality. And certeinly no Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive Generation in the Present Cours of Nature can be a greater Work then those Primitive Generations, which were the Immediate Works of God, and Improper Creations. Wheras if Natural Generation should be any other then the Production of Created Essences into their Actual Existences, or Corruption then such Reduction therof, they should be Proper Creation and Annihilation: For if any new Essence or Entity whatsoever, which was not before, should be Caused to Be by Generation, then it must be Properly Created; and if that which was before be Caused Not to be by Corruption, then it must be Properly Annihilated. Nor doth it suffice to say, that Generation or Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are not of any Simple Substances, either Matter, or Spirits, but only of <hi>Composita,</hi> and Accidents, or Modes, or whatsoever they pleas to call them; for whatsoever they are, or howsoever Exile, or Desultory their Nature may be, yet they are Real, and Entitative Somthings, not only in our Reason, but in Nature, as I have shewed: and indeed otherwise Generation and Corruption should be no Real Alterations; but the things Generated or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted should be Realy the same as they were before; and so we should deny all Generation and Corruption: wheras they Realy are, and do Produce Real Alterations, or some new thing Actualy, which was before only Pontentialy; as every <hi>Compositum,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Substantial, as any Elementary Substance by Mistion of the fower Elements, or Accidental, as Green by Mistion of Blew and Yellow, and the like. Also this doth Sensibly appear in and by all Generations and Corruptions whatsoever: as of all Substantial <hi>Composita,</hi> wherof there is only such a Composition; otherwise they should not be <hi>Composita:</hi> and certeinly the Simple Substances were before Actualy Subsisting in themselvs, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they should not be Substances; and so likewise were the Simple Essences of Accidental <hi>Composita</hi>; as of Green, wherof certeinly the Blew and Yellow were before Actualy Existent, and the Green Potentialy in both. And so of more Simple Accidents Produced out of their Potentiality into their Actuality: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Matter, as this or that Particular Extension, Figure, Density, and the rest; which are Produced Actualy, yet were
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:61550:68"/>
before Potentialy in Universal Extension, Figure, Density, and the rest; otherwise they could not be so Produced; nor can they be Produced into more Actualy then they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Potentialy. Or of the Spirits; as Light, and Heat, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced out of <hi>Calx viva,</hi> Thunderclowds, Haystacks, Firecanes, or any other Inflammable Bodys whatsoever, were before in the Substantial Fire therof Potentialy; otherwise they could not be so Produced; nor can they be Produced into more Actualy then they were before Potentialy. And so we commonly say of Spices, Wines, and the like; that they are Cold Actualy, but Hott Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentialy. And so Vegetatives Produce many Qualitys Actualy in Summer, which were Potentialy Latent in them in Winter: and Sensitives such in their more Adult State, which were Potentialy in them while they were Embryons. And this is the very Natural Cours of Generation and Corruption, and of all the mutual Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procations therof; whereby <hi>Generatio unius est Corruptio alterius,</hi> and <hi>Corruptio unius est Generatio alterius</hi>; which is the <hi>Rota,</hi> or Figline Wheel of Nature, turning about in the perpetual Revolutions and Conversions therof by such Production and Reduction, as I have before declared. Between which two doth always intercede Privation; as it was Antecedent in the first <hi>Chaos,</hi> which being In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and Inane, was the Universal Privation of all those Actual Existences which were afterward Produced in the Six Days; for so Existence is capable of Privation, but Essence only of Negation. But Privation is not any such Positive Principle in Generation or Corruption as Matter and Spirit, which are the Simple Substances whereby the <hi>Compositum</hi> is Consubstantiated, becaus it is only Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative: nor as the Essences of Accidents in their Potentiality, which are Positive Entitys; but only the very Potentiality therof; which as it Relates to Actuality, is called Potentiality, and as it Relates to Existence, Privation. Thus both Matter, and Spirit, or Form, and also Privation, are all Comprehended in the <hi>Chaos.</hi> And from this Dark <hi>Chaos</hi> of Potentiality by the Revelation of the same Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit, (which first Moved in it, and brought forth Light out of Darknes) we may discover the <hi>Magnum Arcanum,</hi> or Grand Secret, of Natural Generation and Corruption; and plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv how all the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> were therin no such <hi>Phaenomena</hi> as since they are, but first Created Potentialy, and then Produced into their Actualitys, and Appearances, Originaly in the Six Days, and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:61550:69"/>
since Successively in all the <hi>Secula</hi> therof. Wheras all Human Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, being ignorant heerof, hath groped in the Darknes of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Imaginary Notions, which the several Sects therof have In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented to themselvs, and so in stead of this <hi>Chaos</hi> and Creation have supposed an Eternity, and Selfsufficiency of Matter, and the <hi>Potentia</hi> therof, or Matter and Motion, Equivocal Generations, Transpeciations, and the like; and though <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> in his <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moeomeria</hi> hath approached somwhat neerer to the Truth, yet his Conception therof is very gross and rude, and like the rest, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth that also to have been Eternal. And now, though I have so largely explained and fully proved this Doctrine of Natural Generation and Corruption; yet becaus I conceiv it to be so Fundamental, and therefore very requisite that we should most clearly and familiarly understand it, and discern this Divine Light; and that I may produce it out of the dark Crepuscula and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused Notions of the antient Philosophers, who have partly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged it in their Potentialitys, Eminences, and <hi>Homoeomeria,</hi> and the like; and again obscured it with the denial of a Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; I shall now summ up together the Effect of all I have said before. That God in the Begining Created all Essences of any Generable and Corruptible things either in their Actualitys, or Potentialitys, and all the Real Modalitys therof whatsoever where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they were made Generable and Corruptible, and indeed every thing of them or in them that is Entitative in any kind or maner whatsoever; that is, all the Simple Substances of Matter and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; Elementary, Vegetative, and Sensitive, which Subfist in themselves, in their own Actualitys, which therefore in themselvs are Ingenerable and Incorruptible. But wheras they of the same <hi>Classis</hi> may be Mist together, when they are so Mist, they all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one <hi>Mistum,</hi> which is the Thing Generated, and Realy is another Somthing Different from them; but Actualy Subsisting in them, which therefore was before Potentialy in them; that is, in their Power to Produce it, and in its own Potentiality to be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced out of them; and the Form therof is, that which I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore call <hi>Forma Misti</hi>; as of Stones, Metalls, Mules, and the like: and if they be of several <hi>Classes</hi> which cannot be Mist, yet they may be Composited together; as indeed there is no Mis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ion without some such Composition; for so the very Elementary <hi>Mista</hi> are Composited with the Matter, and Vegetatives with
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:61550:69"/>
them, and the like; and therefore the Form therof may be more rightly termed <hi>Forma Compositi.</hi> And as this <hi>Forma Misti,</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positi,</hi> is thus Generable or Corruptible, becaus it doth Subsist in the Simple Substances, and so may be Produced out of them wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it was Potentialy; and then it is Generated, and in its Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality; or Reduced again from it into its Potentiality, and so Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted: so also Simple Accidents, which clearly were Created in and with their Simple Substances, as Extension, Figure, Density, Rest, and the like, in and with the Matter; becaus they also Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist not in themselvs, but in their Substances, they may be so Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and Varied by Generation and Corruption, as to be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced out of their Potentiality into Actuality, and Reduced from their Actuality to Potentiality again: thus Heat and Cold, and the like, do sometimes Actualy Exist, and sometimes do not, but are in their Potentialitys: and so also they may be Mist or Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited, as <hi>Tepor,</hi> and the like: and all such Accidental Mist or Composited Forms Subsist Immediately in one another, and all of them Mediately or Immediately in their Substances. And this is that which I intend; wherin I can not conceiv how any, who doth not deny a Creation, can differ in the Thing, but only about Terms; concerning which I must assign one Distinction, the want wherof I suppose hath much hindred the right understanding of the thing itself; that is, between this Potentiality, which we all mention generaly, but more strictly is to be restrained only to things Generable and Corruptible, whose Simple Essences were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Created, as I have shewed, in their Potentialitys; and Possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, which may be also of any thing Creable or Annihilable: For though Possibility is not nor can not be Infinite, (becaus there can be no other Infinite besides God, who always Actualy is; nor Notfinite, becaus there can be no other Notfinite besides Nonen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, which always Actualy is not) yet it is Properly Indefinite, and as boundless as Infinite Omnipotence, which only can not Create another Infinite; and not such an Improperly Indefinite, as the Dust of the Earth, and the like, which I formerly menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned. But it is to be distinguished from Potentiality, as that which hath no maner of being in Nature, neither Actualy, nor yet Potentialy; for then it should not be only Possible, or Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, which is yet in Notfinite Nonentity, and only may be Caused to Be by Infinite Entity or Divine Omnipotence; wheras whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:61550:70"/>
is in Natural Potentiality was Created in the Begining, and may be Produced into Actuality by the Finite Power of Natural Generation. Wherefore I conclude, that whatsoever is in Natural Potentiality is Entitative, even while it is Potential: becaus other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise Generation and Corruption should either be Creation and Annihilation, which is Impossible; or no Real Alterations, which is most fals. But Divine Philosophy, which is only true and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory, doth lead us back from the present Cours of Natural Generation and Corruption to the Original Institution therof in the Six Days, and from thence to this first <hi>Chaos</hi> of Potentialitys, and from thence to the Creation, and so terminates in one Infinite Creator of all things Actual or Potential.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Thus Generation rightly understood is and must be always Univocal; that is, not only of the same Name, but also Unige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, or of the very same Nature. But we must distinguish between the Generation itself, which I now Intend, whereby any thing is Formaly Caused, or Intrinsecaly Generated in itself, and the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerator, or Extrinsecal Efficient Caus, which indeed may be either Equivocal, as when an Hors and Ass beget a Mule, and the like; as well as it may also be Univocal in that respect, as when Horses be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get an Hors, and Asses beget an Ass, and the like: Yet in both these the Generation itself is Univocal with itself; becaus it is, as I have shewed, only the Production of somthing out of its Essence into its Existence, which is most Unigenous; becaus the Existence Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced is only the Existence of the Essence therof, which was Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God with a Potentiality of Existence, and cannot be Annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Generation, but is only Altered thereby, being so Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into the Actuality of that which it was before Potentialy in itself; and so it is only its own Existence of its own Essence; then which nothing can be more Univocal, or Unigenous. But the Generator, only as an Extrinsecal Agent or Efficient, doth collect and concoct the Seed, Preparing and Predisposing it for the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and then deciding and casting it forth from it self, or conteining it in itself, as some other thing besides itself, and its own Individuality, as it is said of Vegetatives, <hi>Cujus Semen seipsum Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minet</hi>; and so a Beast doth contein the <hi>Faetus</hi> in its Womb, cherish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and fostering it as a Fowl doth an Egg Excluded; and a Fowl doth hatch Eggs by Incubation and the Heat of its own Body; as
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:61550:70"/>
Eggs of Fishes are cherished and fostered by the Heat of the Sun in the Water, or as Seeds of Vegetatives in the Earth; which are no more more then is performed by Egyptian Ovens, or Italian Capons: but the Seeds by their own Plastical Virtue and Power do Effigiate, Compose, and Generate, themselvs Intrinsecaly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own <hi>Species,</hi> and Individual Nature. And thus Horses and Asses Generate Mules Equivocaly, no otherwise then Horses begett Horses, and Asses Univocaly, by an Extrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and Instrumental Causality, which is like the Spear that wounded the pregnant Sow in the <hi>Spectaculum,</hi> whereby she brought forth Pigs, and in some Generations, as of Sound, this Instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality is Necessary. Only Univocal Generators are more Proper, and more Natural and Efficacious, Efficients then Equivocal; and even some Equivocal Generators as they are more Homoeogeneous are also more Instrumental then others; but always the Generation itself, or Production of the Essence into the Existence of the thing Generated, is most Univocal; and is not, nor can not be Equivocal by Transpeciation, or any Transmutation, ór Conversion of one Essence into another, but only of the same Essence into Existence, for as it is most true, <hi>Ex Nihilo Nihil fit,</hi> by any such Conversion of Nothing into Somthing, which is Impossible, as I have shewed; so, <hi>Nihil dat quod non habet,</hi> is also as true and tantamount. And yet they who Deny the one can Affirm the other, with the Addition of Fictitious Eminences, and Transcendent <hi>Potentiae,</hi> or Creations by the Finite Power of Natural Generation instead of the true <hi>Chaos,</hi> and Creation by the Infinite Power of a Divine Creator, who is indeed the only true Eminent Caus. Nor do any of their Instances prove any such Equivocal Generation in itself, but clearly disprove it. So when an Hors and Ass beget a Mule, that Generation is as Conformable to the Mist Seeds of both Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, as when Horses beget Horses and Asses beget Asses. Only that Instance affordeth this farther discovery, that the Seed of the Female Hors doth Contribute to the Generation, aswell as the Seed of the Male Ass; becaus the Mule is of a <hi>Species</hi> Mist of both. And the Burning Glass proves the Sun to be Actualy Hott; which yet some deny, and so from one Falsity would prove another. But their most common Instance of Conversion of Water into Air, and so Reciprocaly, is very fond; for the Water is not Converted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Air, but only Rarefied in itself, and then we call it Vapor;
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:61550:71"/>
which Differs as much from Air, as Air doth from Aether or Aethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Matter, as they term it, which I shall shew heerafter to be very Different.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. I shall now inquire generaly into the Maner, Method, or Process of Natural Generation and Corruption, and how they are performed. All Generated Substances, or Substantial <hi>Composita,</hi> are as I have said, Composed of Matter and Spirits. Wherefore in their Substantial Generation there must first be Matter, and a requisite Body therof, which though it may be Rarefied, or Densified, yet can not be Augmented, or Diminished, without a new Creation, or Annihilation; which is beyond the Finite Power of Natural Generation and Corruption. And as there must be such a Body of Matter, so also Spirit, and such Spirits Subordinate or Coordinate as are Requisite according to the Law of Nature, and of the particular <hi>Compositum.</hi> Also the Matter and the several Material Spirits must Consubstantiate one another, that is, Sensitive Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Vegetative Elementary and they the Matter being all Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect in themselvs, which can not otherwise be Generated; but the Human Spirit being a Perfect Substance in itself, is only Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posited; Also Coordinate Spirits of the same <hi>Classis</hi> may be Mist to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as the Elements must always be so Mist; which appears by the Mistion of their Qualitys as in <hi>Tepor</hi> and the like: wheras Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, Heat, Plastical Virtue, and the like are not so Mist in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation. And as in Original, so also in Successive Generation the Composition and Mistion must be such as doth Produce the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite Accidents both of Matter, and Spirits into their Actualitys: without which their Substances cannot Act, nor Appear to us, but are unto us, as if they were not, and as in their first <hi>Chaos,</hi> Us<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>les, and Ineffectual. And this is carefully to be observed by Chymis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, and Physicians, and all such Operators; that there be not only requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site Matter, and Spirits, Ingredient in their Compositions; but also such a fitt Mistion Internaly, and such Instrumental Causali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys Externaly, as may Evoke and Actuate the Accidents or Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons therof, without which they will not Operate or Appear; and whereby their Operations and Appearances will be very strangely and suddenly Altered, as I have said of Wine, and Spices, which are Actualy Cold to the Touch, but Hott to the Tast; and so some may be Cold to the Tast, which will afterward become Hott by
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:61550:71"/>
farther Concoction in the Stomack, and the like. Now this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Local Mistion of Matter and Spirits must not only be <hi>per mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nima Corpuscula,</hi> but <hi>per omnia Puncta,</hi> though Maceration and Comminution are indeed Degrees therof, and Preparatory to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, and every <hi>Compositum</hi> being Macerated and Comminuted is thereby Prepared for Corruption, and so for a new Generation; according to that general Maxim in Nature, that Union doth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify, and Disunion weaken; not only Proportionably, according to the respective Parts, but in the Whole. And so the more the Maceration and Comminution is into less and less Particles, the more Preparation is there for a new Generation, which is by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Mistion, or Adunation, and not by Aggregation only; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus without such Adunation there is no Generative Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor indeed any Mistion, but a Local Separation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently no <hi>Compositum</hi> Generated, either Substantial, (for so a Mule must be Perfectly Mist and Composed of an Equine and Asinine Substance, otherwise it should consist of Indefinite Equine and Asinine Particles, which should not be a Perfect Mule, but a greater Monster then any Poetical Hippocentaur, or Hirco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerv, (which is only half of one Kind, and half of another) or Accidental, as of Contrary Qualitys, Heat, and Cold, and the like, wherof there can be no Contemperature without such a Mistion; for such Qualitys are not like Passive Affections of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having only Degrees in themselvs, as Density, and Rarity, Gravity, and Levity, and the like, but being also Active in their own Nature would Naturaly Act to the utmost, and be most Intens in themselvs, if they were not either Violently Obstructed by some Contrarietys or Impediments, which by their <hi>Nisus</hi> they also endeavor to overcome and break through, or Contemperated by a Natural Mistion of their Contrary Qualitys <hi>per omnia</hi> in and by the Primitive Generation therof out of their Potentiality into Actuality by Degrees; and which is their Natural Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. For their Temperature must be by a Perfect Union of both whereby neither hath any Advantage over or against the other, by being in the least Disunited, or having any private Sphere of Activity in itself, for then it fights against the other to the utmost, as Fire and Water, and the like: which if it were so in their Composition there should never be any Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Continuing Contemperature thereby, but the most Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:61550:72"/>
Flesh should have only so many several Pricks, or Needles, of Intens Heat, and Intense Cold, which would be rather a double Torture, then any gratefull Temperature. And so <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretius</hi> his Meadow of Flowers, though at a distance, through the Infirmity of Sight, it may represent one Confused Color, yet Sensibly hath so many several and distinct Colors: and so dry Powders of Blew and Yellow being very finely Pulverisated and M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>xt together by a close Aggregation may appear Confusedly Greenish; which is only the same Infirmity of Sight, and may be rectified by a Microscope: wheras Nature is certeinly Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that is, most Genuine, and Real, in all her Operations, and not, as such Uncouth Opinions would render her, only External Violence, and Imposture. And as there must be such a Local Union of Spirits <hi>per omnia Puncta</hi> of the Body of Matter to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiate it and Appropriate it as a Particular Body for itself, which otherwise could not be so Consubstantiated <hi>per omnia</hi>; so the proper Union or Mistion of Spirits among themselvs though it be Coextensively <hi>per omnia,</hi> yet if it be not also Spiritual, that is Spiritualy Contemperated, and Coadunated, the Generation will be Imperfect, and either Momentany, or Meteorical. As if Cloth or Paper be wetted with Water, though there be a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Imbibition therof by the Cloth or Paper, yet they are not Perfectly Impregnated, and so there is no Perfect Generation; but they seem still to remain Cloth, or Paper, and Water, seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raly and distinctly in their own Natures; and not to be Mist, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one <hi>Compositum</hi>: and yet that Imbibition is an Inception therof, so that when they are Perfectly Separated again by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iccation, and Evaporation, the Vapor which is a very Subtle and Intenerating <hi>Menstruum,</hi> as I shall shew heerafter, doth Evoke and carry away with it some of the Spirit of the Cloth, or Paper, Mist with it. But Oiled Paper seemeth to have a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Degree of Imbibition, and is not so easily Separable, and is like Staining with Colorate Corpuscles, Liqued that are so Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed, which is of a midle kind between Mingling of dry Colors and Dying in Grain. And there is a Perfect Coextension or Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Union <hi>per omnia</hi> of Emanant Colors, which yet is not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete Generation, becaus their Substantial Spirits are not Localy United, though the Emanant Qualitys are Localy Mist <hi>per omnia</hi>; as if Rays of Light be Transmitted through a Blew and through
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:61550:72"/>
a Yellow Glass so as they Intersect and are thereby Localy Mist <hi>per omnia,</hi> there will be a Green Generated by that Intersection; or if you hold the two Glasses Partly one over the other against the Sun where they are Single they will appear Blew, and Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and where Double a very Orient and Smaragdine Green: and yet these being Emanant Rays, belonging to their several Inherent Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

And in all Generations, which are not Momentany (as that of Emanant Colors, and the like) there are first Inceptions, and Embryons therof, and so more and more Perfect <hi>Composita</hi> by Degrees, in every Instant of the Process therof, which if it be produced to the Perfection of the Species, is Perfect, and otherwise more or less Meteorical and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect. But though Local Union only doth not make a Perfect Generation of the <hi>Compositum</hi>; which therefore is as suddenly Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable, as it is Miscible, yet no perfect Generation can be without such a Local Union <hi>per omnia,</hi> as well as Spiritual Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as I have said: and such a Generated <hi>Compositum</hi> as is by
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:61550:73"/>
both is not easily Separable, or Corruptible. And I desire that trial may be farther made heerof, whether any Substances so Separable were ever so Generated and Spiritualy Impregnated <hi>per omnia</hi>; (as Metall Corroded or dissolved by <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> which will again return into its own Body, and perhaps was only Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minuted and made more Fusile, but never Impregnated by the <hi>Aqua fortis</hi>) which commonly appears by Alteration of the Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of the Body. But Flame which is a most Momentany Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial <hi>Compositum,</hi> as I shall shew heerafter, is a more Perfect Production of the Actual Fire out of the Potentiality of the Fiery Vapour, and so seems continualy to be Corrupted and pass away with every Individual part of the Fume. And I suppose Brine to be a Perfect <hi>Compositum</hi> of Water and Salt, which can not be Praecipitated, nor Percolated, or the like. And it appears plainly that they are so Mist <hi>per omnia</hi> by the former Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Condensation, which can not Possibly be only by Aggregation or Allocation. Nor can they be sever'd by any Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, though never so Subtle and Powerfull, as may be tried by Mint, Willow, or the like sett in a Glass of Brine, which will draw up both the Water and Salt together; and though by the Vegetative Power and Plastical Virtue therof it will after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Excern and Expume the Salt a while, yet it will be soon overcome and killd by it, as Salt doth generaly kill all Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getatives (except some Seaweeds which require and retein a Saltnes in themselves) if it be too strong, though a little Saltness, and such as the Plastick Virtue can overcome and subordinate to itself, may excite Vegetation both in the Earth and Seeds. Thus as Matter is Consubstantiated with Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Spirits, and they one with another, so also with Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and they with Sensitives; and so certeinly Vegetatives; might be Mist one with another, as well as Sensitives are in a Mule and the like, which are more Intire and Indivisible in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs, and not so Miscible as Vegetative Spirits, as I shall shew heerafter: though they are none of them Properly Indivisible like Immaterial Spirits, becaus they are Material and do Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately or Meditately Consubstantiate the Matter, which is Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. But probably none of these Spirits are necessarily Ingaged in any Particular Body or part of Matter nor Confined unto it, but only Conteined within the Universal Body therof, as I have
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:61550:73"/>
said; becaus no Matter, which is equaly Indifferent to all Spirits, and Receptive therof, is so mutualy Ingaged to them. Yet as Elementary Spirits do require a several Density or Rarity of their Bodily <hi>Composita</hi> (which they Form for themselvs according to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite Degrees of Density and Rarity, though generaly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Regular or Symmetrical Figures) So Vegetative Spirits have a Plastike Virtue whereby they do also Regularly and Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricaly Effigiate their own Bodys, and the Bodys of Sensitives whereunto they are subordinate, and make them more Organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, as fitt Officines, and Instruments for those more Regular and Oeconomical Spirits (which Oeconomy is only Potential, and not Actual, untill Generation.) And then, becaus they are also very Vehement and Operative Spirits, and like Culinary Fire would soon be Extinguished, they require a constant Fuel and Nutriment; yet that Nutriment is not like the Fomes of Flame, which is only <hi>Fumus Accensus,</hi> and so the Individuality of the Flame is continualy changed with the Individuality of the Fume, but a subordinate Nutriment of Vegetative Spirits by Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and of Sensitive by Vegetative; which are so Subordinate one unto another, as I shall shew heerafter. And the <hi>Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> Vegetative, or Sensitive (which, as I have said, is more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and Indivisible, as it is also more Oeconomical) remains the same in its Oeconomical Individuality till it be corrupted: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise a Tree, as an Oak, or the like, should be like <hi>Theseus</hi> his Ship, at last not the same which it was at first; and so an old Beast should not Remember what he did when he was young, if he should not continue Individualy the same. But though the more Excremental Parts as Leavs, Flowers, Hairs, Nails, and the like do often decay, and are as often renewed, and the more Integral Parts less, as Pith, Bark, Flesh, and the Like; and the more Noble and Constituent Parts least, as Root Wood, the Skeleton, Veins; Arterys, Nervs, Intestines, and Organs; yet certainly the Individual Predominant Spirit Vegetative or Sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, which Denominates the <hi>Compositum,</hi> and renders it Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual, doth remain untill the Dissolution therof. The Excess of Nutriment is turned into Augment of all those Parts, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps of the Spirit itself, which as it may be Mist with other He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogeneous Spirits, as in a Mule; so may also Unite with more of its own Homogeneous Spirit, and be Augmented thereby, untill
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:61550:74"/>
it attein its <hi>Acme.</hi> Nor is there Properly any Consistent State without any Growth or Decay, as in a Square; but when the Growth ends the Decay begins, though more like the Ascent and Descent of an Arch, then of an <hi>Isosceles</hi>; that is, most at first and last, and least in the midst. The Excess of Nutriment and Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth Generate other Individuals of the same <hi>Species,</hi> and though Generation be during Nutrition, and Nutrition during Augmentation, if the Nutriment be Copious, and the Actual Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Spirit Vigorous, which can Concoct to all those De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and accordingly Decide what is requisite for those several Uses; yet if otherwise a Beast or Tree be Penuriously Nourished, it will be Dwarfed, or very little Augmented, and Generate less; becaus Nutrition is First and most Necessary for the Individual <hi>Compositum,</hi> Augmentation Next and Less, and Generation Last and Least. And indeed Nutrition and Augmentation, are, as other Subordinate Generations, for the Preservation and Growth of the Individual <hi>Compositum</hi>; and for the other, which is therefore more specialy called Generation, becaus it is Coordinate and Specifical, for the Propagation of another like Individual <hi>Compositum</hi>; which is by Collecting and Composing another Specifical Spirit and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy into the <hi>Epitome</hi> of the Seed, which, as I have said, by its own Intrinsecal Virtue doth Intrinsecaly Generate itself, and so becomes another <hi>Compositum</hi> in itself, Effigiating its own Body, and Nourishing and Augmenting it, and afterward also Generating another by the Plastike Virtue therof, and other Internal Spiritual Powers, which God first Created in and with the Spirits in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining, and were afterward Actuated and sett in Order by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit, who was the Supernatural and Universal <hi>Protoplastes</hi> of them all, as I have shewed. And so they still continue in their Successive Generations and Corruptions; wherin, though the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and Spiritual Qualitys be the chief Operators and Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects, yet the Matter is the Body, and all the Accidents, and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections therof are accordingly Instrumental therin: and so are also all Common Accidents; as Number, wherof the chief Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentality is Unity, which doth Fortify and reduce several Principles into one <hi>Compositum</hi> Oeconomy and Individuality. Nor indeed can I conceiv any other Power to be in Number, which is only so many Units; and the very Multiplication therof or Duality is rather Instrumental in Corruption then in Generation. Also Time
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:61550:74"/>
is very requisite in the Process of Generation,, as I have shewed. And so likewise Extension; for no Body either Elementary, or Vegetative, or Sensitive, can possibly be only a Point; which can not Exist severaly, And though every Part or Particle of Water be Water, and the like, yet Organical Bodys must have several Organs, or so many Members or less Corpuscles wherof the Whole must be Composed; and that according to the <hi>Species</hi> therof must be of some requisite Magnitude; for though Oaks and less Trees may be of several S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>zes, yet none of them can be so small as some Herbs, and Grass; and so though there be Dogs of very Different Bignes, yet none can be so little as a Mite, or some almost Ato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical <hi>Animals.</hi> Also Figure is very Instrumental heerin, as well as in Mechanical Tools, or in the Body of an Army; where the <hi>Globus,</hi> or Orbicular Figure, is for Safety round about, the Square <hi>Phalanx</hi> for Strength, the <hi>Cuneus</hi> or Wedg to make Impressions, and the like. And so they and others are also requisite in Nature and Natural Operations, especialy in Organical <hi>Composita</hi> which require Bodys fitt for such Operations, of Various Figures, and most Symmetricaly Composed. And no Art of Statuary, or Painter, can so farr Imitate them as to endure the Criticism of a Microscope. And the whole Feature and Beauty of Organical Bodys is only the Symmetrical Conformity of their Various Figures. Porosity serveth for Excerning, and thereby for Preservation of the <hi>Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>situm,</hi> and also for Corruption by more easie admission of any Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solvent or <hi>Menstruum,</hi> being a Partial Comminution or Dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Body in itself, as Perfect Continuity doth fortify. And therefore also Density doth Preserv, not only in Proportion to the Parts, but in the Whole, as it is more United in itself and in all the Parts therof: and hath Proportionably more of the Spirit, and more United. And as Maceration doth weaken, so also Rarefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And every Specifical Spirit doth require a Body of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Density or Rarity, wherof there are Innumerable Degrees, and it can hardly be supposed that any two Bodys of Spirits Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficaly Different are of the same Degree of Density exactly, but either more or less. And as the <hi>Compositum</hi> is Varied by a new Predominating Spirit, so the Density or Rarity of the Body therof is Varied likewise: as may appear by Impregnating, and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>impregnating, and the like. And so likewise Gravity and Levity and the Motion therof to Station, but especialy the Principal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:61550:75"/>
to Union or Contact, are very Instrumental in Generation and Corruption, as appears by the Local Union of Emanant Rays. Yet Matter and all these Various Affections therof are no Formal Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salitys of Spirits, or Spiritual Qualitys, or of the whole <hi>Composita</hi> Consubstantiated and fitted thereby, as I have shewed. But when the <hi>Compositum</hi> is thus Composed M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And so were the Original <hi>Composita</hi> Produced by the Divine Spirit in the Six Days, and have ever since, and still do continue according to that Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Cours of Nature; From which when God himself doth Vary, it is Miraculous, and when Nature doth Aberr, it is Monstrous: and yet even those particular Monstrositys are generaly Comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within this Universal Law of Generation and Corruption; as all Equivocal Productions, and the like; being otherwise gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raly Conformable therunto, as I have shewed. And as Nature doth only work by those Ingenerable and Incorruptible Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Powers, and Virtues, which God first Created in the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and then sett in Order in the Six Days; so Art can only work by Application of these Natural Principles, Powers, and Virtues, which is also Monstrous and Disorderly in respect of the Constant Cours of Nature that was Produced in the Six Days, though it be according to the Nature of Intellectives, and Sensitives, being External Operators, so Ingeniously and Artificialy to Apply them, by their Natural Wit and Art, which is somthing more Divine, and more like to the Operation of the Divine Spirit, even thus by Disordering to Order and Improve Nature for their own Use and Service. But neither Nature, nor Art, can work Miracles, much less Create, or Annihilate, any thing.

                  </gap>ural Generation and Corruption, so I shall from the Review therof Deduce the whole Scale and Order of all Generable and Corruptible Natures. Wherof Matter is the Lowest, which is the Common Body of all such Spirits as do Consubstantiate it, Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, or Mediately, and Mansion of others which do only Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit it. And no Matter can be without some Spirit Consubstantiating it, being only an Imperfect Substance in itself, and therefore in the Begining had a Superaethereal Spirit to Consubstantiate the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aethereal Body of Matter, whence it is Denominated Heaven, as well as Aether and Air, and therefore also Superaether, though it be not Elementary yet is of the same <hi>Classis,</hi> becaus it doth Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately Consubstantiate the Matter, as well as Elementary. But though the Matter can not be without some Material Spirit so Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiating it, yet, as I said, they are not Ingaged to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Matter but may Remove from one part of Matter to another, as Matter may from one Place to another in the Universal Body therof; and clearly Immaterial Spirits, which do not Consubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate the Matter, need no Consubstantiation by it, and may be in this or that Extension of the Matter, but can not pass beyond it into any Imaginary Inanity, or Nonentity; becaus they also are Entitys; and within one and the same Universal Province and Law therof. Much less can any Matter wander beyond the Utmost Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of itself which is the Circumferential <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Highest Orb therof, beyond which it can not Ascend, as it can not Descend below the Center. Wherefore that Fansy of <hi>Lucretius</hi> is very Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile and Vain, that if an Arrow were shott forth beyond that Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference it would fly forward Perpetualy; for then it must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Ascend from the Center of the World, and never attein any other Center of Rest; which is most contrary to the Law of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Station; and also might Exist, Localy beyond the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:61550:76"/>
Extension of the whole Body of the World, and be another less World or Univers in itself, which is most contrary to the Law of Motion to Union; whereby, as I have said, the whole Body of Matter is Naturaly Constituted such an Orbicular Body, by such a Perfect Circumference and Center, and is not Protuberant in any Part of itself or other then a most exact Globe, becaus that is the most United Figure, wherunto the most Universal Law of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth Oblige the whole Matter therof: and even Spirits them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs do Exist only within the Universal Coextension and Locality; becaus beyond it there is no Place, or <hi>Ubi,</hi> or Entity, wherin they may Possibly Exist; for as they have no Extension of themselvs, so also no Place, or <hi>Vbi,</hi> whatsoever, but only in the Extension and Body of Matter, wherof, and wherin, they are Such Active and Operative Substances and Spirits. The next in this Scale of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are the fower Elements; Aether, Air, Water, and Earth; which none can deny to be, and I shall now prove them to be Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when I have first explained the Term, which will plainly Elucidate the Thing: and I shall do it Exemplarily by Matter it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, which is indeed the most Common Element, or Praeelement therof, and Immediately Consubstantiated by them, and the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraetheral Spirit: and so Matter is their first Body, or Element, which is the true Notion of an Element; and so I intend it to be a Natural <hi>Substratum</hi> of some other Superior and more Active Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and which may be so Composited or United with it, as a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with a Spirit but not that the Spirit is Produced out of any <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia,</hi> or Equivocal Causality therof, which I have already s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o one <hi>Compositum,</hi> which is the very Generation therof. And these fower Elements are commonly so called in respect of the Superior Spirits, wherof they, with the Matter, become a Second Matter, or Prepared Body therof, as the Matter was of them, for they only, and the Superaethereal Spirit, can Immediately Inform the Matter, and the Superior Spirits only Mediately by them, and so one by another, according to their <hi>Classes</hi> and Ranks in the Scale of Nature, as I shall now shew. And though any one Elementary Spirit might Consubstantiate the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the first <hi>Chaos,</hi> as well as the Superaethereal Spirit, yet until they were all Prepared and Predisposed by the Divine Spirit, and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:61550:76"/>
fitly Mist together in the Three first Days, no Vegetative or other Superior Spirit could be Produced, or Inform any one of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and also the Matter; becaus not any one of them alone together with the Matter is a fitt Body of the Superior Spirits, more then the Superaether, which is Superelementary, and no such Elementary Body of any other Spirit whatsoever. But these Fower Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments must be all Mist together as they were in the Three first Days, and never since were, nor shall be, untill the Dissolution of the World, wholy Unmist and Separate, as they were in the first <hi>Chaos</hi>; though that Mistion is and must be Varied by continual Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and Corruption, to make them more particularly fitt Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys for the several Superior Spirits, wherof probably every <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> doth require a Various Mistion, aswell as some Variation of the Figure and Density of the Matter, which is so Varied by the Various Mistion of these Elementary Spirits. Now that they are fower such Elements as I have described, doth plainly appear by their Denominations in the first <hi>Chaos,</hi> and their orderly Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration in the Three first Days, for the Production of the Superior Spirits, Vegetative, and Sensitive; which I shall more fully dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover in my ensuing Discourses therof. And as I have proved that they are not only Matte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, nor any Diversifications therof; but do so diversify the Matter, as their Body for themselvs; (and much less are they Produced out of any <hi>Potentia</hi> of the Matter) so also are the Superiour Spirits no Diversifications of them, but do so Diversify them for themselvs in their Various Mistions. By all which precedent Discourses I have sufficiently proved that there are such Inferior Substances and Spirits which are the Bodys or Elements of the Superior, otherwise all Material Spirits should only be Matter, or they should be without their Bodys, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently Immaterial: wherefore if they have such Bodys, and yet are not the same with those Bodys, then plainly they are the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, or more Active and Operative Substances which Inform or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirit those Bodys, and Reside, and Operate therin, as their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micils, and Officines; which I therefore call their Element or Subordinate, and Preparatory Substance, or Elementary Principle, of the <hi>Compositum,</hi> which together with the Predominant Spirit therof doth Constitute it such a <hi>Compositum</hi> as it is: by which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position and Constitution it is Generated, and so Denominated by the Predominant Spirit therof to be of this or that <hi>Classis</hi> in the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:61550:77"/>
Scale of Nature. And this is all that I intend by Element gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raly; and whosoever frames any other Notion therof, may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by doubt and dispute it, and fight with his own shadow; though more particularly we call these first and lowest Spirits which Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately Consubstantiate the Matter Elementary, and so the fower Elements; becaus they are the first and lowest of Spirits, and the first Elements therof. And sensibly in all Dissolutions of any Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial <hi>Composita,</hi> as we may still deprehend Matter, which is the Praeelement of all others, so also these fower Elements, which can not now Naturaly Exist Pure, as they did in the first <hi>Chaos,</hi> though we call them this or that Element, as any of them is more Predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. And so in the Carcass of any Beast, when it is dead, yet there may be still some other Spirits remaining, but most apparently the Elementary; and so in the Trunk of a dead Tree, or Timber, or the like: and there is not only one, but all Fower, which also do always remain in all Chymical Separations whatsoever; so that the <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> is not only Matter, or only one Element, as in the first <hi>Chao<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nor is it Possible for any Art, or any Power of Nature (according to the present State therof which was first Instituted by God) to Separate these fower Elements one from another; though they are and may be Variously Mist one with another, as also it is not Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to destroy their fower great Elementary Bodys, Ae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And accordingly they are as fower several Provinces, Variously Inhabited and Furnished with all the <hi>Composita,</hi> Starrs, Vapors, and Meteors, Fishes, Beasts, and the like, and Situated according to the Predominance of their proper Elementary Bodys, and requisite Station therof in several Spheres one above another, so as no Planetical Orbs are. And heer I must also observ from my Text, that there are only fower such Elements, and no more (nor any such several Kinds of them, or of any of them; as is expressly said of Vegetatives, and Sensitives, as I shall shew heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.) And therefore we have no mention of Stones, Metalls, and the like, in this History of the Creation, as of several Elementary Kinds, becaus they are only several <hi>Composita</hi> of these fower Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Wherefore we must also understand that there are not only fower first Qualitys of these fower first Elements, as some have supposed, which could never make so many and so very Different Sorts of Elementary <hi>Composita,</hi> as there are in Nature; nor yet may we assigne to any one Element besides its own Proper first Quality some other Social Quality of another Element in a more Remiss Degree, as to Ae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:61550:78"/>
though they be not Homogeneous, as I shall shew heerafter: and thus Drines is more Concordant with Heat then with Cold, which is Contrary to Heat; though neither of them be any Proper Qualitys of the same Spirit of Aether, or Fire, but of other Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: nor doth Heat Properly or Directly Dry more then Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten, but only Consequentialy, as I shall also shew heerafter. But they who can affirm all the Elementary Spirits to be Educed out of the <hi>Potentia</hi> of Matter, and that one Element may be Transpeciated or Converted into another, may also affirm what they pleas of their Qualitys, and transfer them from one to another: which Suzugy of Qualitys they have also Invented, as they suppose to Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile and Mediate between Contrary Qualitys; though they be not any Degrees of either of them, but Proper Qualitys in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs, and Accidents of other Substantial Spirits: nor doth that Contrariety of Qualitys need any such Mediation, being Produced by Degrees out of their Potentialitys, which are not Contrary Actualy, or otherwise Mist by Degrees into their Actual Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature. The Ignorance of which Doctrine of the <hi>Chaos,</hi> and the Potentialitys therof, and the Imaginary Supposition of such a <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia</hi> of the Matter, out of which not only Existences, but the very Essences both of Accidents, and also Substances, may be Educed, by Equivocal Causalitys, Transpeciations, and such new kinds of Creation, and Annihilation, as men have pleased to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, instead of the true Creation, and <hi>Chaos,</hi> which God hath Made, and Revealed to us, hath been the Fundamental Error, and Root of all the Consequential Absurditys. But yet while they thus Grope in the Dark, they Catch at some Shadows of Truth; as plainly their <hi>Potentia</hi> doth allude to the Doctrine of Potentialitys, and is Substituted instead therof: and so this Supposition of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Different Qualitys in the same Substance doth partly Intimate another great Mystery in Nature, which I shall now discover and unfold; that is, That indeed there are several Qualitys also Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Essentialy in one and the same Substance, Proper to itself, and so subsisting in it, and flowing from it, as I have already declared concerning Matter and the Affections therof; not only Mediately, as Figure from Extension, and Gravity from Density, and the like, (which are only several and Realy distinct Products or Propertys of the same Qualitys) but as others Immediately Subsisting in, and flowing from it; as Extension, and Density, which are not such
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:61550:78"/>
several Propertys one of another, for so the same Orbicular or Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bical Extension and Figure may be either Dens or Rare, Grave or Ligh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And thus in the Aether there is not only Heat, but also Light, and Planetary or Circular Motion, and perhaps several other Principles of Influential Virtues and Qualitys not only proceeding one from another, as Particular Propertys, but Immediately Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in, and flowing from the Ae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Of all which I shall Discours heerafter, and now only observ that of these, and the Various Mistures and Temperatures therof, all the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary <hi>Composita,</hi> like so many Arithmetical Changes, are Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, which therefore are not mentioned in this History of the Creation; becaus they are only Compounded of such other Simple Essences before mentioned, and not of any new Essence Created in the Begining, and not before mentioned, as Vegetative, and Sensitive Spirits, and the particular Sydereous Spirits: wheras all Sulphureous, Mercurial, Saline, Sanguineous, Bilious, Phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike, Oleous, Saxeous, Vitreous, Ligneous, Carneous, Coriaceous, Osseous, Corneous, and many other such Elementary Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if we could Investigate and find out all those Simple Qualitys (wherof very many are still Occult to us) none of these Compound Qualitys could be any longer Occult. And yet many Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and Chymical Wits, becaus they will not freely acknowledg their own, which yet indeed is Human Ignorance, and Common to us all, will also Substitute as Simple Principles, such Compound Qualitys of <hi>Sal, Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> though others among themselvs not satisfied heerwith do also assigne many more of the rest; and yet none of them all are Principles or Simple Essences,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:61550:79"/>
but only Compounds, and Decompounds of others, or one of another. And the last Chymical Separation that can be made, Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly will be only a Reduction to the fower first Elements, that is, to somthing wher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus <hi>Sulphur</hi> is as Fire, Predominant in the Composition therof, <hi>Mercury</hi> as Water, and <hi>Sal</hi> as Earth; but becaus Air is the most Insensible of all Elements, therefore they have not observed it among the rest in their Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nor in this or any other of their Distributions: so that if we should wholy trust to Chymists, we might even lose one of the fower Elements; though they are to be commended heerin that they have not assigned or set up Mercury Volant, which is only a Vapor, instead of it. Also like Air there are many other Simple Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences of Elementary Qualitys, which in their Mistion with others do not Sensibly so betray themselvs, as those which they call the fower first Qualitys, and yet Philosophers have found out the Sent of some of them, as Opacity, Magnetical Virtue, and the like; which I shall endeavour to prosecute and promote as farr as I may in some previous Essays, and so recommend the more Curious Search therof unto others, as one of the greatest <hi>Desiderata</hi> in Philosophy: and now proceed farther. As Elements are the Second Matter, or Prepared Body of Vegetatives, so are they also of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitives, as a Third Matter, or Prepared Body therof; and so Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitives do Comprehend Subordinately in their Composition Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives Immediately, and Mediately the Elementary Spirits, and by them more Mediately the Matter, and Vegetatives Immediately the Elementary Spirits, and Mediately the Matter, and Elementary Spirits Immediately the Matter; but not Convertibly; nor are any of the Superior Educed out of the <hi>Potentia</hi> of the Inferior, becaus they are Superior, but only Subordinate them unto themselves, as I haue said. And as Elementary Spirits require several Diversifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the Matter to make fitt Bodys therof for themselvs, and accordingly diversifie it by their own Architecture, so do Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Spirits both it and the Elementary Bodys, and so Effigiate it, and Temper them, for their own Proper Use, as I have said. And I suppose all Plastike Virtue to be from these Inferior Spirits; that is, Inorganical from Elementary, and Organical from Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative: and though the Sensitive Spirits do Predominate and may

And though Elementary Spirits are Definitely Fower and no more, yet these Vegetative and also Sensitive Spirits, are Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite; and it is so said of them, that they were brought forth after their kinds Indefinitely, and so all these <hi>Species</hi> of Beasts and Fowls were preserved in the Ark, and can not be Multiplied, nor shall be Diminished. Nor are there only such several Spirits of Trees, Herbs, Grass, and of every <hi>Species</hi> of them, which by a Proper Plastical Virtue Created in and with them by God do severaly Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figiate their Proper Bodys, and the Organism therof, but also Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Subordinate Vegetative Spirits of Fishes, Fowls, and Beasts, and of every <hi>Species</hi> of them, which doth so Effig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

according to the Particular Nature and Orb therof, which is heerin a Module of the great Orb of the Univers. So also all Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical Natures, which are Homogeneous, do Comply and Consort together and open their Bodys one to another, and so also Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate one another, and there is some Accord, though less among Homaeogeneous, and as we say, <hi>Par Pari</hi>; and there are certein Analogys and Confederacys between Heterogeneous; yea even Advers and Contrary Natures do thus Conspire together for the Common Good, as Rest and Motion to Union, which may be Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and to Station which is downward, and so Heat and Cold, Moisture and Drines, do all make a fitt Temperature for all Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary, as well as Vegetative, and Sensitive <hi>Composita.</hi> And their own Proper Qualitys can not Actualy Exist without such Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature of and with the rest; which is their Political Perfection, though the others be their own Proper and Private Perfections. and therefore in the <hi>Chaos,</hi> though the Elementary Spirits did then accordingly Constitute the Matter of their Fower great Bodys by requisite Proportions of Extension, Spherical, and Globular Figures, Density, Rarity, and their several Stations, and the like; yet they could not Actualy Produce their own Heat, Cold, Moisture, Dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and their other Active Qualitys, before they were Prepared and Predisposed by the Divine Spirit with fitt Mistions and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperations; nor could they, or can they, yet Exist in their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Vehemence and Intension, without such Contemperation (which as I have said is most wonderfully Produced by Degrees out of their Potentialitys into such Mist and Contemperate Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alitys, more Naturaly then by their Actual Extremitys, which Violently Oppugn one another, and thereby endeavor to destroy one another) and Such Actual Concertation and Oppugnation, which at last doth destroy one or both of them; as Flame, which is almost continualy Incensed and Extinguished, and the like: and yet these Contrary Qualitys of the Elementary Spirits are thus Naturaly Miscible, wheras the Proper Accidents or Affections of any Substances of Different <hi>Classes</hi> are not nor can not be so M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And becaus Individual and Specifical Natures do thus Confederate, therefore there is also such a Polity and Oeconomy of the Universal Nature which doth Subsist in them all; and not only a Scale of Degrees, wherof I discoursed before, but a Republike of all the <hi>Cives</hi> and Societys therof. And as Beauty, Virtue, Piety, and their Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrical and Conformable Excellencys, are the most Excellent things in Nature, so is this Polity, and Oeconomy, the Strength, Goodnes, and Glory therof.

And I rather fear that all this, and much more that may be said, will not be sufficient to convince them, whose Delicate Witts are grown so Wanton, that they can not be pleased with any thing unles it be some Curious Novelty, and Ingenious Error, and so much delight to wander in the wild Labyrinth therof; that they care not to be brought out of it; where I shall therefore leav them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs,

And some of their Philosophers induced therunto, or in compliance with the Popular Religion, did not only deny the Aether to be Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary, and Igneous; but also seemed to doubt whether the very Matter therof were Common and Homogeneous with Elementary Matter; as certeinly it must be, if it be M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>her is most Rare of all the Elements, becaus the Spirit therof doth so Require it, and Caus it to be; and therefore, as I have said, it is Highest of all Elements, though not so Rare as the Superaether, which is therefore the Highest of all Bodys. And so Rarity of Matter, becaus it hath less Matter in the same Extension, hath therefore some fitnes and Analogy to a more Spiritual Substance, and is as it were a more Spiritual Body, as more gross Spirits are more Material: and this chief Elementary Spirit of Aether requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a more Rare Matter then the rest, and so also doth Culinary Fire Rarefy, as I shall shew heerafter; but yet, as I have said, the most Rare Matter is Matter, as well as the most Dens, and not Spirit, but of another Different <hi>Classis.</hi> And as the Body therof is very Rare, so also it is very Fluid, though Rarity and Fluidity be not one and the same, more then Density and Consistence; yet as Density is Analogous to Consistence, so is Rarity to Inconsistence or Fluidity. And therefore an Adamantine, Golden, Brazen, or Specular Aether, or Planets therin, are rather Poetical, then Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical. And wheras <hi>Elihu</hi> saith, <hi>Hast thou with him spread out the Sky, which is strong, and as a molten Looking Glass,</hi> or <hi>Speculum</hi>?
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:61550:84"/>
The word Sky, also signifieth Upper Clouds in the Original, and if it were to be rendred Sky, might be aswell understood of the Air, which is an <hi>Expansum,</hi> and spread out, as well as Aether; and that very Expansion seems to imply no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence in either of them: and the Comparison is not of a Consistent, but a Molten or Fusile <hi>Speculum,</hi> such as Water or the like: Now plainly the Text intendeth the Upper Clouds, wherof the precedent Discours is in the Context, and which being Anhydrous do so Reflect the Light, like such a Molten Looking Glass. And yet Translators render <hi>Expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum</hi> (as it is Originaly) Firmament, in favor and compliance with Graecian Philosophy; wheras certeinly the Air, which is also termed <hi>Expansum</hi> as well as Aether, is not Solid or Firm. And the Reason assigned why the Aether should be Solid and Firm is more Vain then the <hi>Hypothesis</hi>; which is, becaus it Moves one way, and the Planets therin another way, and therefore there must be Seaven Spheres of them, and an Eighth of the Fixed Starrs, and to these is since added a Ninth, and a Tenth, which must be the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum Mobile,</hi> to solv these <hi>Phaenomena.</hi> Wheras in the First Day there was only one Circumvolution of the whole Aether, one and the same way, to make Day and Night, and so untill the Fourth Day; and then we do not read of any such Division therof into Spheres, as of the Disposition of the Water and Earth into a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raqueous Globe, but only of the Creation of the Starrs. Nor is this Supposition of Aethereal Spheres any Solution of the several Advers Motions; for perhaps the slower Motions of the Fixed Star<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Also the Circumvolution of them by the <hi>Primum Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile</hi> must be either by a Corporeal and External Impu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

the others so many several ways; Or it must be by some Spiritual <hi>Potentia</hi> which must be either of another Spirit, and so Infinitely; or of itself, as indeed it is, and then the several Planets and Starrs may also aswell have such several <hi>Potentiae</hi> in themselvs, as the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum Mobile,</hi> and so many several Spheres Moving themselvs and their several Planets in them by such several and Advers Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Also firmnes or Consistence is a Proper Quality of Earth, as I shall shew heerafter, and not of Aether; and though the Aether be Mist with all the other Elements in some small Proportion, yet the Consistence which it ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and though the Proper Aethereal Virtue according to that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Power therof doth so carry it about with a Perfect Regulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet since it hath been Accursed and Blasted as well as Earth for the Sin of Man there are many particular Alterations, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, and Corruptions, appearing in it, such as <hi>Maculae,</hi> Comets, and the like; as I shall shew heerafter, which plainly prove both that it was Mist with the other Elements, and was a Generated <hi>Compositum</hi> in the first Perfection therof, and that now it is Imperfect: and yet the Diurnal Motion therof is still as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular as before, as well as the constant and Immovable Position of the Earth: and therefore most probably there is some other Special Quality which doth Preserv it in that Regularity, as Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticity doth the Earth and Magnets in their Polar Positions. And as this Element is most Active and Operative, so God, who doth nothing in vain, and is stiled <hi>The God of Order, and not of Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> did therefore first Perfect it, and Produce the Active Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litys therof, as the Chymical Instruments of Nature, whereby it was first sett on work; and so at last when he shall Dissolv this whole Elementary World, it shall be by Fire, both Aethereal, and Culinary, Congregated and Condensated (as before the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the great Deep were broken up, and also the Cataracts of Heaven opened) and shall thereby again Melt down this whole Inferior Globe, if I may so speak, with a Deluge of Fire, as he did formerly overflow the Terraqueous Globe, with a Deluge of Water; wherof he hath thus farr declared unto us the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but not the Time; for <hi>Of that Day and Hour knoweth no Man, no not the Angels in Heaven</hi>; nor may we compute it by any Motions of the Heavenly Bodys, or of any of them; for this Dissolution not being Natural, but Violent, doth therefore attend no Natural Causality, but may be at one Time as well as another.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The Spirit of Aether being Fire, the most Proper Qualitys therof are apparently Heat, and Light; which are neither one and the same in themselvs, nor do Immediately Subsist or Proceed in, or from one another, but both in and from the Substantial Spirit. For apparently one may be Actualy without the other, as Heat without Light, in Fume; and if there be not also Light without Heat, as in the Gloworm, and other such Bodys, yet certeinly
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:61550:86"/>
the Actual Heat is not Proportionable to the Actual Light ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: and heer in the Text Light only is Named, and not Heat, though they are partly Synonymous in their Original Etymology, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Congenerous and Social Qualitys in Nature, Proceeding from the same Substantial Spirit. But I can not conceiv Drines, as I have said, to be any Second Quality Proceeding from Heat, nor indeed very Symbolical or Homaeogeneous with it, but rather another Collateral Quality of Earth, and Indifferent between Heat, and Cold; for Vapors, Oils, and the like, which are very Moist Bodys, are more Inflammable then Salts, and Ashes, which are very Dry, and all Heat doth Melt or prepare for Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, which doth Actuate Moisture; wherefore all Consistent Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys generaly are Actualy Cold, and Actualy Dry, or at least, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to either Heat, or Cold, to be Actuated in them. But the Proper Action of Heat is to Heat, or Univocaly to Generate or Produce Heat out of other Inflammable Bodys; which thereby it doth also Move, becaus as I have said, it requires a most Rare Body, and so when Heat begins to be Actuated, it begins to Rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the Body Heated, which being an Expansion therof, necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily causeth some Local Motion: and so it Melteth and prepareth for Fusion by Rarefaction, and even Iron Heated doth Swell before it Melt; and in order therunto it doth Convell and Corrode the Parts of the Bodys, as may appear by the Operation of <hi>Aqua for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi> in Dissolution of Metalls: and as it thus Operateth in respect of Corporeal Rarefaction, or Comminution, which is Preparato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry therunto, so it is Spiritualy Active in itself, and Causeth Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as a fitt and Analogous Instrument therof, aswell as in its own Aether, as I have shewed; though that be probably as Rare as it can Naturaly be, becaus it is the most Rare Element, and can not be more Rarefied by any other Elementary Quality, and hath already Produced the greatest Rarity that it can in itself. But though Motion be such a notable Instrument of Heat, as generaly it is also of all the Operations of Material Spirits upon the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet neither Heat nor any others are only Motion, as I have formerly shewed generaly, and shall now shew particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Heat, which is not so much Caused Originaly by Motion, as it is a Caus therof, though the Generator may Generate Heat, which was Potentialy before in the Body wherin it is Actuated, by Motion, as I have said, Mediately, but more Immediately by

And if any can sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that Heat is a Motion one way, and Cold another way, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire them to assigne the different Local Motions of these, or any other Spiritual Qualitys, which they never yet have done, nor indeed can do, becaus they are no such Motions Naturaly. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinly Heat and Cold, which are most Contrary Qualitys, require answerably Contrary Motions: but as there is no such Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety between Rest and Motion, so neither is there in Motion it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, wherof there is only a Local Opposition, as I have said: for Motion is only one and the same Principle, from which no such Active Contrariety can Possibly proceed: though it may be an Indifferent Instrument of Contrary Agents, as of Heat, and Cold. Again, Heat and Cold may be M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>st together into one Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which we call <hi>Tepor,</hi> and that is both Hott and Cold, though Mist, and more Remiss thereby; wheras Opposite Motions can not be so Mist, for if Heat should be by Local Motion one way, and Cold by it another way (which though not Properly Contrary, yet must be Diametricaly Opposite and Advers) then one such Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion must necessarily stay and stop the other, mutualy, whereby there should be no Motion at all, and consequently neither Heat nor Cold: and this <hi>Tepor</hi> is, as I have said, <hi>per omnia,</hi> and not only <hi>per minima,</hi> much less by any Imaginary Parallel, or Meridional Lines, or the like, which yet must Intersect, and thereby also the Moving Parts must stay and stop one another: and I suppose if
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:61550:87"/>
Mathematical Philosophers would pleas to reconsyder Local Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion according to Mathematical Rules, they would easily disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Vanity of any such <hi>Hypotheses.</hi> But as Heat doth thus Caus Motion by Rarefaction, Segregation, Corrosion, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution, of some Parts, so consequently by Condensation, and Congregation of others; and so it is said to Segregate Heterogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and Congregate Homogeneous Parts; becaus, when the whole Body is Rarefied and in Fusion, the Homogeneous Parts Naturaly Congregate themselvs, and the Heterogeneous are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Segregated. And so in making of Salt the Vapors go one way and fly Upward, and thereby the Salt goeth together another way, and Sinks Downward. Also thus though Heat doth Immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Rarefy, it may Mediately Condensate; and as it doth Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately Melt, so also Mediately Constipate; as by Rarefying the Water, and Melting it more into Vapor, it Condensates and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stipates the Salt, and more notably in Syrups, Tarr, and the like, which will be boiled into a Gumm, or Pitch, or into a Consistence beyond them. And so it may have many other such Collateral and Consequential Operations and Effects. But there is not only Heat Inherent in the Igneous Body; for plainly it heats at a very great distance, which must be by Heat Emanant, becaus all Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is by Contact; for as there is no Vacuity between Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys, so neither in Operations, between the Operator and Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated: and that there is such Emanation both of Heat and Light I shall plainly shew heerafter, and also now observ, that there is another wonderfull Property of Emanant Heat, which is Attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and this is indeed the chief End of the Emanation therof, by which it doth not only heat at a distance, but also draw other Bodys to it, whereby it may more neerly and more strongly Operate upon them by its Inherent Quality from which the Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant floweth forth, as I shall also plainly shew heerafter concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Electricity. And such an Attractive Heat is that which is called Vital, whereby Animals Nourish themselvs, Attracting their <hi>Fomes,</hi> or <hi>Materia Nutritiva,</hi> by this Heat, and then Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting, Concocting, Congregating, Segregating, and Exercising all the other Properties therof in order to their Nutrition. Also to this purpose there is a double Power, or rather several Degrees of Heat, wherof one is Calefactive, and more Moderate, and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, which Generates, Nourishes and Fosters, as the <hi>Te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

the Spring, Incubation of Fowls, and the like; and the other Caustike, and more Intens and Torrid; which Corrupts, Destroys, and Burns, as in all <hi>Incendia.</hi> But certeinly Heat itself is Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated only by Production out of Potentiality into Actuality, as I have said, either Univocaly by Fire alone; as when Wood burns in the Fire, and the like; or Equivocaly, which may be by many other Equivocal Causes, whereby the Potential Heat may be freed and delivered out of its <hi>Chaos,</hi> and Prison of Potentiality. And so it is Generated by Motion, as by Collision of a Flint and Steel, or by rubbing of Firecanes, wherin one may smell the Fire before any such Collision or rubbing, which was ready to break forth, and is freed by such Commotion, and the Fiery Vapors or Corpuscles thereby discharged; and so by Contrition, as Coachwheels will sometimes be fired; and generaly all Terrene Bodies Rubbed do heat, becaus, as Earth hath the greatest and grossest Mistion with all the other Elements, so it hath commonly a notable Portion of Fire in it. And it plainly appears that the Motion is only Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental heerin, becaus other things do thus also Equivocaly Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate Heat; as Water cast upon Quick-lime, and Vapor in Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-clouds, Hay-stacks, and the like: and it likewise appears that they do only thus Equivocaly and Instrumentaly Generate or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it, because the Flame therof afterward will be Extinguished by Water, or blown out by Motion like any other Fire. Nor may we wonder much at the large quantity of Fiery Flame which is thus Produced out of a little Wood, or Gunpowder, or the like, when we consyder <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Certeinly <hi>Ignes Fatui, Stellae Cadentes,</hi> and the like, Continue much longer in their Individualitys; which is through their more Temperate and Generative Heat, wheras the Fire of Flame is more Caustike and Corruptive, and both Generates and Corrupts so suddenly. But Fire in Iron Candent (which is not Iron and Fire Individualy several, nor Fire only in the Pores of the Iron, as hath been supposed any more then in Fume) for so
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:61550:88"/>
Glass which is Imporous will also be Candent; but, as I have said, the Fire wherewith the Earth of the Iron is Mist, and which was before in it Potentialy, being now Actuated, doth Appear and Operate in it; and becaus it doth Emitt none or very little of the Fiery Vapor or Fume, therefore doth not Flame, or very little, and so reteineth the same Individual Fire Actualy in itself much longer; which may be so Actuated in it again, and again; becaus the Fire therof is more fixed in the Mistion, and less Volatile: wheras if a very strong Coal, as of the best Oak, or Birch, or the like, be Incensed and Inflamed very long in a Furnace, (which it will endure and yet come out Whole and Firm) though it may be made Candent again, yet it will not so kindle nor burn afterward, as it did before the Fiery Vapor therof was Emitted and Volatilised. And wheras some have Projected to make Fire Perpetual, I esteem it Possible if the same Individual Fire could alway be continued in A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And so Perpetual Fire would make a Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Motion, which is Possible, and not only Actual in Aether, but also in Water, and yet not found to be Practicable by Art. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so Fire is Corrupted by its own Vehemence; for by Rarefying the Body wherin it is, it Dilates and weakens itself; and lieth more open to the Air, which thereby hath greater Advantage, and Power over it, nor indeed can any of these Contrary Qualitys Exist in their utmost Intension and Extremity, which is contrary to the Common Law of Nature, and their own Particular Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is to be Mist in Contemperature, or at least to Oppugn others; and if either that Mistion, or Combat ceaseth, their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity also ceaseth; and so they return into their Potentiality, as I have before shewed. But Fire as it is a Hott Spirit may be overcome with Cold, as Flame by the Ambient Air; and as it requireth a Rare Body, so it is Opprest or Choaked by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

(though it hath some Actual Cold in it) so much as by the Fluid Density therof, which Insinuateth into, and Invadeth all the Fiery Body; and so Water Actualy Heated will quench Fire as well as Actualy Cold; for that Actual Cold is very soon &amp; easily overcome by the Fire: and W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rm Water is somwhat more Rare Vaporous and Insinuative, and by the Actual Heat the Fiery Body is more opened unto it (as Univocal Spirits do generaly open their Bodys one unto another) whereby it doth as well or better prevail against it then Cold Water. Also warm Liquors Tinge or Dy better then Cold by their Insinuation, but Clammy, as Milk, and the like do most notably Suffocate Fire, yet if the Fire be not by such Insinuation Penetrated, but only covered with some Continuous Bodys it will not be Suffocated, because its own Body is the same, and not Altered thereby; and therefore Iron Candent in a Box continues hott almost as long as it would out of it, wheras Flame which is only a Fiery Vapor is soon putt out by an Extinguisher; which returns the Vapor upon itself, and so stifles the Flame: And if Coals of Fire be covered with some Ashes, the Fire in the Body so covered doth long continue, though the Flame Emitted be presently Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished thereby. And therefore it is to be observed, that as Fume is a Niggard, becaus it is not Incensed, so Flame which is so continualy Emitted, is a great Waster of Fuel, and of the Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Heat therof, which still passeth way; and becaus it Ascends, doth less Diffuse the Heat, but is therefore fitter for Boiling; for it being a Fluid and Subtile Vapor, doth embrace other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys with the Inherent Heat therof, which is much stronger then Emanant Proportionably, and by such Insinuative Penetration it doth better Melt Brass, and such other Metalls, that are more Penetrable by it, and more easily Fusible in themselvs; wheras Iron is so Robust Contumacious and Consistent in itself, that it doth not yield much to Flame, but is to be Melted by the Contact of Inherent Fire of Charcoal, and the like. Again, if Fire can overcome its Enemy wholy, then it is more Augmented by the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential Fire therof, which it Univocaly Generateth and Produceth also into the same Actuality with itself; as Water cast in a small Proportion upon a very Ardent Fire doth increas it, and Assist it (as Smiths commonly find by such Practice) and I suppose Fire may be made so Intens, as to burn and spend the very Fume and <hi>Fuligo</hi> of the Fuel. Also there is apparently an <hi>Antiperistasis</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:61550:89"/>
such Contrary Qualitys (though some pleas to deny it by a greater <hi>Antiperistasis</hi> of Contradiction) which doth Excite them mutualy, but especialy the Victor, which is commonly Fire; and this is the very Nature of their Contrariety, which, as I have said, <hi>Marcet sine Adversario,</hi> and the Conqueror is both Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in his Actual<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And that I may not seem to speak Metaphoricaly; I shall plainly shew that there is Realy such an Intentional Conflict in these Inferior Natures, though neither Sensitive, nor Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive in themselvs. For thus is this Combat between Heat and Cold Managed, as it were, in a formed Batell; wherin first they draw out their Forces to their Frontires, not only their Emanant, but also their Inherent Powers, and not Circumferentialy after their ordinary maner, but Purposely and Directly, to that Part, and toward that Point, where the greatest Opposition is; and wheras otherwise their greatest Power is generaly in their Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where it may best Unite and Fortify itself, (for the same Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litike Reason to Preserv and Defend itself) it doth now Issue forth to the very Confines of its own Body, and there Encounter the Contrary Quality which would destroy it. As in a Boiling Pott the Bottom therof which is next to the Fire is most Cold, so as you may safely feel it with your Hand; and so it is observed that the Vital Heat is Internaly greater in Winter then in Summer: for Contrary Qualitys not Mist but Actuated in several Substances do thus Resist one another, as Homogeneous Qualitys do Evoke and open their Bodys one to another, and are more ready to U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and Combine together. And where one Contrary Quality doth begin to prevail against the other, that Retireth back again to its Center where it is strongest, as Heat to the Stomack. And so in Vesse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now wheras it is said that the Motion of Fire is upward toward its own Element, though it be true that generaly it is so, yet I do not conceiv that to be the Reason therof, becaus Local Motion Upward, or Downward, is Immediately of the Matter and Body, and not of the Spirit; and therefore Aether is Uppermost, Becaus it hath a most Rare Body, and so Flame Ascends Upward, becaus it is Vapor Accensed, which
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:61550:90"/>
by that Accension is also more Rarefied; and wheras that is Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Culinary Fire (wherin anyother Element may be Predominant in the Mistion therof) Vapor or Water Rarefied is the most fitt Body to retein it in its Actuality; for Air, though as Rare, yet hath a Proper Quality Contrary to Heat, that is Cold, as I shall shew heerafter; wheras the Moisture of Vapor is Indifferent, as I have said, and therefore it exhibiteth a most Lucid and Subtile Fire, and such as is most like to Aethereal: but if the Fire be Actuated in a more Aqueous or Terrene Body it doth, and necessarily must, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend; and <hi>Aurum Fulminans</hi> Incensed flys every way, with the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Bodys more Rare, or more Dens, that are Segregated and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spelled by the Explosion.</p>

The other Quality of Aether is Light; which as it is most Glorious in itself, and doth Actuate the Visibility of all this Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable World, so by the Spiritual Analogy therof, it doth not only discover the Nature of other Elementary Qualitys, but also of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getative and Sensitive Qualitys, and the very Substances of Spirits in some respects, Symbolicaly and Hieroglyphicaly; so as I can not conceiv a fitter representation therof to Sens then Emanan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And as Heat is the most Chymical Instrument in Nature, (and therefore some Chymists have stiled themselvs Philosophers by Fire) so Light is a most Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical Instrument; and a more exact Study of Optike, Diop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trike, and Catoptrike (that is, of Physical rather then Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal) might render us Philosophers by Light; wherefore as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend the more Curious and particular Inquisition therof to others; so I shall now generaly and occasionaly heerafter make some Philosophical Observations therupon in my ensuing Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourses. But though Light be such a Conspicuous and Consyde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Quality, yet I do not therefore suppose it to be any Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, much less a Body, or having any Corporeity in itself; and shall prove it to be no more a Corporeal Substance then Heat; and yet I do not remember that ever any hath affirmed Heat to
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:61550:90"/>
be any such Substance, though Heat and Light be very Homogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Analogous, and which is yet more strange, not Inherent Light, but only Emanant is thus esteemed Corporeal, though In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent be farr more like to such a Substance then Emanant: but becaus Inherent is already in a Body, we look upon it and the Body in Gross, and so take them both together; wheras Emanant is Emit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of the Body, and is not Inherent in any other Body, and therefore some suppose it to be a Bodily Substance in itself; becaus they do not distinguish between Substances, and Accidents, whose Difference nothing can more discover unto us then this Emanant Quality, which is so far Different from the Substance that it is even Localy Separated from it, though Originaly and Continualy Radica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and Subsisting in it. I have already shewed that the whole Work of the Six Days was no Creation of any new Elementary Entitys, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Substances, or Accidents, but only a Production of Substantial <hi>Composita,</hi> or of the Actualitys of Accidents out of their Potentiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys; and such, &amp; none other, was this Production of Light in the First Day, as I have also more particularly shewed in my former Enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all the Six Days Works: wheras the Substantial Aether was one of the Heavens expressly mentioned to have been Created in the Begining, and so the Air was another, and both were then totaly Dark, and afterward Illuminated by this Production of Light out of Darknes, as a Lamp is now Lighted by Successive Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, or Production of Light, as an Accident out of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiality therof into Actuality; which also declareth the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Generation therof to have been none other; though Incension seem to be as like to a Creation, and Extinction to Annihilation, as any other Instances I know in N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ture. Also the first Light was only Inherent in the Aether, or Emanant from that Part therof wherin it was Inherent into other parts of it, but not into the Air which was not yet Expanded or made Diaphanous and fitt to Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt it, still in the <hi>Chaos</hi> of itself as well as Water, and Earth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Second Day: for if the Light, then also the Heat of Aether, should have been Emanant into it, and that should have been Transmitted to the Water, and so caused the Vapors to Ascend in the First Day; which plainly was not, untill the Second Day. Wherefore if this Light were a Substance in the Air and Water, and not only an Emanant Quality, flowing from the Inherent Light of Aether, then either God must have Created more parts
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:61550:91"/>
of that Luminous Substance in the Air and Water in the Second and Third Days, which is Fals; or Produce it out of them as he did before out of Aether: and so we must affirm the Air and Water to be Inherently Luminous in themselvs, which they are not; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise there should be no Day and Night Artificial in them, as there is; or they must produce out of themselves a new Substance, which was not in them before, that is, Create it, which is Impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible: wherefore it must necessarily be only such an Emanan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the very maner and way of Emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being a Transition Localy from the Inherent Quality, which is Localy in the Substance, into the Diaphanous Body, which is Localy Distant from it, doth plainly prove it to be an Accident, or Accidental Quality both Realy and Localy Different from the Inherent Light, and also from the Lucid Substance; becaus it is Originaly and Continualy Radicated in the Inherent Light Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and Mediately in the Lucid Substance, wherin it doth Subsist and not in the Diaphanous Body, into which it is Emanant; nor is it any Part therof, nor Mist, or in any kind Congenerous with it, which doth plainly shew Emanant Light, and all other such Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant things not only to be Accidents, and of an Inferior and Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Nature from Substances, but also from Inherent Qualitys; for though Emanant Qualitys do Spiritualy according to their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Nature Subsist in their Lucid Substance by the Mediation of their Inherent Qualitys, yet Coextensively and Localy they Exist in the Diaphanous Body; wherin they do not so Subsist, as in the Lucid Body, neither do they so subsist in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs, but are Instantly Removed with the Lucid Body; wherefore they are neither Substances in themselvs, nor Mist with the Diapha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Body wherin they Localy are, but do not Spiritualy Subsist. And conformable heerunto are all the <hi>Phaenomenae</hi> and Sensible Experiments of Emanant Light, for so it is Moved and Altered in the very Locality therof according to any Local Alteration of the Inherent Light, and Lucid Substance, and not according to any

And this Locality therof in another Body Coextensively doth Sensibly represent the Coextension of Spirits in Matter. And as it is never Actualy in the Inherent Quality of Light or Substance of the Lucid Body, becaus it is Emanant out of them both, so it is never Potentialy in the Diaphanous Body, as it is such, becaus as such it is only Diaphanous or fitt to Receiv it into itself, as Matter doth Spirits; (which it may also represent unto us.) And itself is sometimes Actualy, and sometimes Potentialy, Produced and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by a most Momentaneous Generation, for if the Lucid Body be in a Diaphanous Body, the Emanant Light will be as Actual as the Inherent; and if it be Obnubilated with an Opacous Body, it is in the same Moment Reduced to Potentiality, which also sensibly discovereth Actuality and Potentiality. And so in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it passeth from Heaven to Earth, though I do not affirm, or conceiv, that Motion to be Instantaneous which is through so vast a Space, (wheras no Motion can be through any Space or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension, which hath Part beyond Part, though it be never so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, Properly in an Instant; becaus it is from one Part or Term to another; as I have said) yet it is so Momentaneous, that to us it is as it were Instantaneous, so as no Mathematical Science, or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Wit whatsoever, can perceiv, and assigne any Difference: and yet we must acknowledg that it is vastly Different in itself, which is also another very wonderfull Contemplation, if it be Curiously consydered, and may well be Reposited among the other Mathematical Mysterys which I have formerly mentioned. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinly there is not, nor Possibly can be, any Physical Discrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Dissection therof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as of a Body or Bodily Substance; for it is Impossible by any other the quickest Motion in Nature of any Opacous Body Interposed to cutt off any Part of a Ray, or to prevent the Reflection therof; which also Sensibly proves it not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be no Corporeal Substance, but of another Nature farr Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from it, and also Different from Inherent Light, for it doth not thereby Return or Recoil into it, but Reflect itsel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:61550:92"/>
nor Gravitate it: and yet if it were Matter Impregnating the Water, or Penetrating the supposed Pores of any Diaphanous Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, it should thereby Gravitate; but indeed there is no such Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration of Pores by Emanant Light; which certeinly is not a Body, becaus though it be not Mist with it, yet it Penetrateth the very Diaphanous Body itself <hi>per omnia Punctae,</hi> for turn an Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Diaphanous Globule against the Light which way you pleas, it will be Equaly as Diaphanous one way as another; which could not be if the Rays did pass only through Pores, as some suppose; unles we should also suppose it to be all Pores, and consequently no such Globulous Body. Also this is most apparently contrary to all the Laws of Refraction, which are always in Direct Lines from one Point to another within the Diaphanous Body itself, and by most Regular Inflections, as I shall shew heerafter, and not through any such Porous <hi>Meanders</hi> and Diverticles: and indeed Diaphanous Bodys, as Aether itself, through which the Sun doth Eradiate, are of all others least Porous; and if the Light did only Penetrate through some more Rare Matter in these Pores, then that being therefore Diaphanous, it must Penetrate through the very Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Matter therof, which no Body can do, or through other Pores of that Porous Matter, and so Infinitely, as I have shewed, or through Interspersed Vacuitys, which is as Impossible as the other; and if it were Possible, yet it should be no Diaphaneity, but only a plain Phaneity; as when we look through a Sive, or Silk, we do not therefore say that the Sive or Silk is Diaphanous, as the Air; and the Air could not be so Totaly Diaphanous as it is, unles it were a Diaphanous Body throughout in the whole, and not only in the Pores therof. And as several Specifical Qualitys may be in the same Place <hi>per omnia,</hi> as Heat, and Light, so also several Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Lights Emanant, which must necessarily D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So if the fower Walls of a Room be painted with fower several Colors, Black, White, Blew, and Yellow, though the Rays of Light Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected from them Penetrate one another <hi>per omnia,</hi> becaus they fill the whole Room, whereby the several Colors may be seen in every Point therof, yet we see them several and Distinct, and not

Mist or Confounded. By all which it plainly appears that Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Union <hi>per omnia</hi> is no Perfect Generative M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>stion, and much less Aggregation. Also when Rays Intersect one another in the same Point, and are Decussated and Inverted, yet being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Reflected, whereby they become Objective to the Sight, they represent their several Colors Inverted. But if they be Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorate themselvs, being Tinged by passing through several Painted Glasses, and be so Reflected Objectively in their Local Union, they represent a Mist Color, as I have formerly shewed; though that be only a Local, and no Perfect Union; becaus they are still several Individuals belonging to their Individualy several Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Qualitys, and Substances; and therefore are not United into one Proper or Perfect <hi>Compositum,</hi> but only become Objectively such to the Sight; and when the Rays of Light are Incolorous themselvs, becaus they are not Objective, but Vehicular, as in the whole Room, though they be then also Localy United, yet they do not represent any Mist Color, but their several Colors, otherwise we could not see them Distinctly: and the Image therof will never be so Confounded in the <hi>Focus</hi> by such their Intersection, but that being Reflected they still appear several. And thus as Light, and other Spiritual Qualitys, so also several Spirits or Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Substances may be together in the same Place, and Penetrate one another <hi>per omnia,</hi> as well as they do the Matter in Consubstantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; becaus, as I have said, they are only in such an <hi>Ubi</hi> Definitively, which is Common to them all, and not Proper to any of them, as Circumscriptive Extension is to the Matter; but therefore several Bodys Unmist, and of several Extensions can not Possibly be in the same Place; which, as I have before observed, is one of the grand Differences between Bodys and their Extension; and Spirits and their Spiritual Qualitys, and the Coextension therof, and doth plainly prove Emanant Light to be such a Spiritual Quality; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus apparently Several L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And so also the Motion therof is not only Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, but Advers to that of the Matter, which is from the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference to the Center, wheras this is most evidently from the Center to the Circumference, otherwise it should not be Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. And now I shall farther discours of the Emanation, Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, and Retreat of Light, which are all such Spiritual Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as shall plainly discover them to be farr Different from the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:61550:93"/>
Motions of Matter, or any Affections therof, and also most won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull in their own Spiritual Nature. And first, the Emanation therof is very Consyderable and Admirable, as I have before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed it, Subsisting in one Substance, and Existing in another, and heerin more Admirable then the very Inherent Light, which doth Immediately Subsist in the same Substantial Spirit therof, and doth Exist alway Localy with it in the same Body: but becaus these most Active and Energetical Qualitys of the first and most excellent Element, Heat, and Light, are thus Originaly Inherent and Confined to the Body of their Substantial Spirit, and no Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration can be at any Distance, but only by Immediate Contact of Substances, or Qualitys; therefore they are Armed and Instructed with these Emissarys, which they send forth through all their Sphere of Activity, which perhaps may be as large as the whole Elementary Globe, but as the Inherent Qualitys are strongest in their own Center, wherin they are most United; so they are the Centers of Emanant, from which they proceed, and wherun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they return again; and these Emanant Qualitys are Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably Stronger, or Weaker, as they are neerer, or farther from the Inherent Qualitys: but in the very Confines between them both, and from which they are first Emanant, they are much Weaker, then Inherent, which Subsist Immediately in the Spirit, and these in them. As suppose an Iron Candent Equilateraly Triangular, wherof the Center is Exactly that Point which is also the Center of a Circle Circumscribed about such a Triangle, in a third part of the Perpendicular Line, above the <hi>Basis</hi>; yet if you touch the Candent Iron at any Angle it shall Burn more, then if you place your Finger in any midle Point of the Cir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>le, so Circumscribed between the Angles; though all the Points of a Circle be Equidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from the Center, becaus at the Angles you feel the Inherent Qual<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ty of the Candent Iron itself, and in the other Points only the Emanant Quality therof. Also I must observ that though we call these Emanations, Eradiations, and so describe them by Rays or <hi>Radii,</hi> or as the Poets stile them <hi>Spicula,</hi> or <hi>Crines,</hi> as so many several Darts, or as the Spokes of a Wheel, or Hairs of an Head, Discontinued between themselvs more and more as they proceed farther from the Nave, or Skull, though Originaly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the Root of them all, that is, in the Inherent Quality (and so I shall make use of this Common Term) yet Properly there are
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:61550:94"/>
no such several Rays therof, nor are they at all Discontinued, but fill their whole Sphere Continuously and Completely in every Part and Point therof, and we only Metaphoricaly fansy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe them by such an Eradiation, as we Mathematicaly in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuous Extension Imagin Lines passing from one and the same Center to every Point of the Circumference, which are Indefinite and Innumerable, and therefore it can not Realy be so in Nature, unles an Unit and Number almost Innumerable should be Equal, which is Contradictory, as I have shewed. But as they are only Extension, so the true Emanation is not any such Eradiation, but one Continuous Flux from the Inherent Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ality through the whole Sphere unto the Circumference therof. And I suppose it to be a Perfect Sphere alway, though not Equaly, Lucid, and that it is not any Spheroid, although the Lucid Body may be of any other Figure, as the Triangular Iron Candent, and the like; and so it seemeth that the <hi>Halo</hi> of a Candle in a Mist or Foggy Vapor is Orbicular, though the Flame be Pyramidal; which therefore Painters so represent; as also the <hi>Halo</hi> about the Head of a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus.</hi> But this <hi>Halo</hi> about a Candle, and Barr about the Moon, and the like, are as it were midle Spheres between the Inherent Light and Utmost Sphere of the Emanant Light, Caused by the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction and Partial Repercussion from the Mists and Foggs about the Luminary, whereby the Rays are partly Reflected which make the <hi>Halo,</hi> and Partly Transmitted (at in a Comet) which make the Utmost Sphere of the Activity therof. Yet these Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary <hi>Radii</hi> of Emanant Light are as Direct Lines, as the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Lines of a Mathematical Circle from the Center to the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference: and if they be Interrupted or Offended by any other Body Refracting or Reflecting them, as often as they are so Interrupted or Offended, they are Inflected and also pass from any such point of Inflection to another in Direct Lines. And that which so Interrupteth and Offendeth their Emanation is somthing Contrary therunto, as Cold is Contrary to Heat: and that can be no Privative, as Darknes which Light alway overcomes; for such Contrariety is between Positives; nor any thing which is not Active in itself, as Density, or any other Affection of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which as they are not thus Actively Contrary to Heat, so neither to Light, or to any other Spiritual Qualitys whatsoever, though according to the Universal Polity and Consociation of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:61550:94"/>
they may be more or less Symbolical, or Asymbolical. And particularly Density is thus a Symbolical Affection of the Matter with that which is Contrary to Light, as Rarity is with it, and other Qualitys of Aether; which, as I have said, requireth a very Rare Body: and so Density is a Corporeal Affection Requisite and Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logous to the one, and Rarity to the other: but as there may be less Inherent Light in a more Rare Body then in a more Dens; as in the Flame of Spirit of Wine, then of Pitch, which certeinly is a more Dens and Fuliginous Fume, then the other; so more of Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Light in a more Dens Body; as Glass is more Diaphanous then thick Water through which it will sink, and yet is more Opacous. Wherefore there is somthing besides Density that is Contrary to Light, which hath been well observed by others, and acquired a Name whereby it may be known, and is called Opacity, which is a Quality of Earth; as I shall shew heerafter. And this is one of the other Qualitys of the Elements, besides those commonly called the Fower First Qualitys, which are to be Consydered and Regarded by Philosophers, as well as them; and as we may not Invent any new fictitious Qualitys, which God hath not Created, so neither may we lose any of them which he hath made to be in Nature, nor Confound any Simple Qualitys with Compound, nor Compound with Simple, which God Created in the Begining be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was any such Composition: and though indeed <hi>Entia non sunt multiplicanda sine Necess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

For at it is said of the Divine Word, so we must also Consyder and Discours of the World as it is; and none can Add to it, or Diminish from it. And God in his Infinite Wisedom did so Create the Heavens and the Earth in the Begining with all their Various Furniture of several Simple Essences, becaus as it is his Infinite Perfection to be One in Himself, so it is also the Perfection of Finite Nature to be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in One, whereby all the Various Perfections therof are Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously Expressed, which could not be only by One. Wherefore I shall sett the same Bound to my self, which God himself hath sett in Nature, neither to go beyond the Begining of the World, nor any thing which he Created therin, nor to fall short therof, or
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:61550:95"/>
fear to affirm these Original Entitys to be such, becaus God who is the First Caus hath so Created them, without seeking any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Caus or Reason therof; or to deny any Natural Mistions or Compositions to be any such Simple Principles or Original Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences though he hath also joined them together, with others, so that we can not sett them asunder Localy by any Chymical Separation. And such an Original Quality I find expressly Light to have been, Produced into Actuality in the First Day, which lay hid before in the Dark <hi>Chaos</hi> of Potentiality; and by the same Reason I know that Opacity was also Produced together with Light, and Mist with it in the Mistion of Aether, with Earth, as well as with the other Elements: becaus there is neither <hi>Pura Lux,</hi> nor <hi>Purae Tene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And this Opacity is a Terrene Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, wherunto the Density therof is Assistant; and so Earth itself is most Opacous, and Water less, yet having some Opacity that causeth Refraction, which is a Partial Reflection; and so Air, and Aether, and all Diaphanous Bodys; for there is no Pure Diaphanei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty without any Opacity. And this Opacity doth not only Reflect, and Refract; but is also Mist with Light in Colors, and in Light itself, which hath some Desultory Color, and is not simply Visible of itself, as I shall shew heerafter: Thus the more fixed Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>alitys of Earth do fix the more Agile and Volatile Qualitys of the rest of the Elements, being as an Alloy to Metall which makes it more Malleable. And so particularly is Terrene Opacity to Aethereal Light; for as Owls can not see by Daylight, so the strongest Sight could not see the Pure Light, nor can it Exist in its own Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Vehemence without the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sture of Opacity. And these Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Mistions are the Natural Perfections of the Simple Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, and Accidents; which do therefore require it, as well as Matter and Material Spirits do Consubstantiation, as I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Now Diaphaneity being only a less Degree of Opacity as
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:61550:95"/>
Rarity is of Density, it is also Partly Opacous, and therefore, as I have said, doth Refr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ct, which is a Partial Reflection, or rather Inflection of the Rays from their own Natural Direction; and there is no Diaphanous Body which doth not Refract more or less, and none that doth Refract, but doth also Reflect. But in all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraction and Reflection the Perpendicular Rays pass through the Diaphanous Body Perpendicularly, and all Emanations Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately are Perpendicular, and neither <hi>A Perpendiculo,</hi> nor <hi>Ad Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiculum,</hi> as in Refraction, or Reflection; which, as we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly Intend by those Terms, are always Oblique Lines. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I suppose that the Rays of any Lucid Body are not so Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fracted in the Immediate <hi>Medium</hi> wherin it is, as of the Sun in the Aether, or of the Flame of a Candle in the Air; for, as I have said, the Flux or Eradiation of the Rays therof issues forth Immediately from the Inherent Light in most direct Rays, and so they must Circumferentialy every way Penetrate their Immediate <hi>Medium</hi> with all their Rays Directly, and not Obliquely, as well as the Perpendicular Ray doth any Diaphanous Body which doth Refract the rest. But we must also observ, that as Opacity doth caus Refraction and Reflexion of the Rays, so the Density of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aphanous Bodys doth Ampliate or Distend the Rays of Expansion, whereby it also weakens them: So I conceiv that Refraction and Reflection are, when the Rays having passed their Immediate <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi> do meet with another <hi>Medium</hi> of a Diaphanous Body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Unequal Opacity, as Air is in Respect of Aether, and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Air, and the like; and as often as the <hi>Medium</hi> is so Varied, there may be so many Inflections of the Rays from every Point of the Variation therof, as I have said; and according to that Une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Opacity so is the Refraction, or Reflection, greater, or less. And which is most wonderfull, and truly Spiritual, the Inherent Light is not less Lucid in itself by all the Rays which it doth Emitt; becaus, as I have said, they are Different Entitys in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs, and when they are Emitted Actualy, are only Produced ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of their Potentiality in the Inherent Light, wherin they subsist, and from which they flow forth into their Actuality: nor is it more Lucid when they return into it again; becaus they only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from their own Actuality into their own Potentiality. And thus the Inherent Light, having such a <hi>Potentia</hi> of Producing the Emanant Rays therof, like an Inexhaustible Fountain, doth not only
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:61550:96"/>
send them forth to Complete the Sphere of the Activity therof, but if they be Refracted, or Reflected, or do Converge, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verge, or however they be Disordered, yet still fills the Sphere, as before, so farr as it is not hindered by any Interposing Opa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. Also even these Emanant Rays have other Secondary Rays Inherent in them, and which they do likewise Emitt to fill the Sphere, as well, and as farr as they can, where themselvs can not approach; as the <hi>Crepuscula</hi> are such Secondary Rays of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Solar Rays, when they Decline by the Suns setting and sink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beneath the <hi>Horizon</hi>; and so Rays that pass into the <hi>Foramen</hi> of a Dark Room make it more Luminous by their Secondary Rays then otherwise it would be, and without which the Principal Rays themselvs could not be seen, though the Secondary are much weaker, and less Lucid; whereby the others, which are notably more Lucid, are seen Objectively. But as I have said the Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Rays are never Actual in the Lucid Body, becaus they are always Emanant in their Actuality, and all the Light in the Lucid Body is Inherent; nor is it Properly any Actual <hi>Nisus</hi> of the Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manant Rays in the Lucid Body to Produce themselvs, but of the Inherent Light to Produce and bring them forth, as the Lucid Substance doth the Inherent Light: and therefore Emanant Rays never Intersect, or Penetrate, the Lucid Body in their Ema<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Refractions, or Reflections; becaus they never Actualy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ist in it, for then they should be Inherent. And now I shall discover a farther Mystery of Light Emanant; whereby I shall shew not only how the Motion therof is farr Different from the Motion of Matter, but how it is a Political and Intentional Motion, as I may so term it, Effectively, for the Preservation and Orderly Position of itself. Thus Emanant Rays first pass into their Immediate <hi>Medium</hi> in Direct Lines or Rays Circumferentialy, as I have said; and where they are first Interrupted in that Cours, and thereby Offended, all the Collateral Rays, so farr as they may, without Intersecting their own Lucid Body (which would Reduce them into Potentiality in the Inherent Light) do Incline on either side to Assist that Perpendicular Ray that is first Interrupted: As if the <hi>Superficies</hi> of any Opacous <hi>Speculum</hi> be Convex, the first Ray that is Interrupted thereby is that which is most Directly Opposite to the <hi>Vmbo,</hi> or Summit therof; becaus that is the neerest Point of the <hi>Speculum</hi> to the Opposite Lucid Body, and the Collateral
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:61550:96"/>
Rays on both sides do therefore Incline thitherward as farr as they may to Assist it; which is the very Reason why the Image Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from such a <hi>Speculum</hi> appears Proportionably less, becaus the Rays by such Inclination do Converge more together; and if many such <hi>Specula</hi> be placed together in one Table, as Baby Glasses, and the like, there will be as many Images of the same Face; becaus, as I have said, the Inherent Light doth always Emitt Emanant Rays, enough to fill the Sphere, whether they Converge, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verge, or however they be Disturbed or Disordered in their Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: and accordingly every one of these Images will be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably less, if the Convexity of the <hi>Specula</hi> be the same, or greater, as they are more, or less Convex. And the farther the Face is drawn back from any such <hi>Speculum,</hi> or the <hi>Speculum</hi> from it, the less Proportionably will the Image appear, according to the Mathematical Proportion of such a Pyramidal Figure, wherof the Face is the <hi>Basis,</hi> and the <hi>Speculum</hi> the Cone: for though the violent Motions of Refraction or Reflection do much vary from Mathematical Rules and the common Motion of Matter, yet the Natural Motion of Emanation from the Lucid Body into the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate <hi>Medium,</hi> and after Refraction, or Reflection from Point to Point, is Exactly Mathematical, and the Foundation of Catop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trike, as the other is of Dioptrike. But though the Object and Convex <hi>Speculum</hi> be never so farr Distanced, yet the Image will never be Contracted into a Point, (whereby it should become no Image) becaus the Perpendicular Ray which is Midst, and hath also some Latitude, will alway keep the Collateral Rays asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; so that though they Intersect, and Invert themselvs, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But it is alway least next to the <hi>Focus,</hi> wheresoever that is. And so also through a <hi>Lens,</hi> or any open Convex Glass. Now this Motion thus Interrupted and Disturbed is not Mathematical, but very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers from it: for if the Base of any Pyramid or <hi>Isosceles</hi> made of Wires Inserted in a <hi>Foramen</hi> be Inlarged by any farther Production therof according to the same Figure, yet the Cone will be where it was before, becaus the Pyramid or <hi>Isosceles</hi> is only Produced from the same Point Contracted; whereas if the Base of the Object be either way Inlarged, the Cone or <hi>Focus</hi> shall still be neerer and neerer to the <hi>Foramen</hi>; and yet the <hi>Foramen</hi> is still the same, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Rays, whether the Base of the Object be farther, or neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, greater, or less; but when it is farther there are more Rays of the Object Inlarged Proportionably, which Converge more toward the <hi>Limbus</hi> of the <hi>Foramen,</hi> and they being more Inflected thereby Intersect sooner, and neerer to it Proportionably according to the Longinquity, and Length of the Rays; as if the Wires were so Decussated through the <hi>Foramen,</hi> and then were Distended and farther Separated at their other Ends without the <hi>Foramen,</hi> the more they are Distended the sooner they Converge and Intersect within it: Also where there is such Interruption of Bodys in their Motion; yet their Inflection is not like that of Emanant Rays; nor is it Refracted the same way but farr otherwise; as if a Bullet be shott Obliquely into Water, which doth Divert the Motion ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it doth I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:61550:97"/>
Proportionably, as it would make it to Graze or Reflect in the Air, which is more Rare: wheras Emanant Light being no Body, but a Spiritual and Active Quality, whose Motion is Circumferentialy from the Center, and which can Penetrate, and is not hindred by a Diaphanous Body, as it is a Body, but only as it is partly Opa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous, (which is another Spiritual Quality Actively Contrary to it) doth not only pass through it, as it is Diaphanous, but as farr as it can doth also Decline from its own Motion to Assist any other Rays interrupted by it, (as in the former Examples) toward which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the rest do Converge and Incline as farr as they may: and thus Spiritual Qualitys can Vary their Motion (which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise also is Mathematical) either to Encounter a Contrary Quality, or to Assist one another: and this is from the same Political Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in Nature of Preserving itself both in its Universal Entity, and in its Specifical Homogeneity, and also in its Individuality; whereby it plainly appears that there is such an Universal Nature, and also such Specifical, and Individual Natures, becaus there are such Real Unions and Confederacys, and such Real Effects therof. And thus Emanant Rays are Refracted in Diaphanous, or Reflected by Opacous Bodys; and do Converge, both in Convex, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave, <hi>Superficies,</hi> toward the <hi>Vmbo</hi> or toward the <hi>Limbus:</hi> and though the Image in one be Erected, and in the other Inverted, yet in both it is Proportionably less; which doth plainly shew the Convergence of the Rays, in the Image: and if the <hi>Superficies</hi> be Lenticular, and not so Orbicular, whereby it is as it were Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convex and Semiconcave (as one Bank is also half of the Vally) there may be a double Image Reflected, wherof one shall be Erect, and the other Invers: yet they shall both be Proportionably less, as before: And if the <hi>Speculum</hi> be Plane, it Reflects almost Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, unles the Lucid Body be Orbicular; as a full Moon, which in a Looking Glass appears somwhat less; becaus the lowest Ray of her Lucid Orb is somwhat neerer to the <hi>Speculum</hi> then the rest, and therefore first Interrupted. And when the Rays have Penetrated the Diaphanous Body, though they are Refracted according to their Points of Incidence, and Inflection, and are so Directed thereby, yet they pass through it in Direct Lines, as I have said, from Point to Point, untill they meet with somthing of Different Diaphaneity therin, which as another <hi>Medium</hi> will again Inflect them, and so when they go forth by the other Opposite <hi>Superficies</hi> Convex, Concave, or
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:61550:98"/>
Plane, into another <hi>Medium,</hi> they have another Point of Excidence, as I may so call it, and another Inflection thereby more, or less, as that other <hi>Superficies</hi> is Figured, or the <hi>Medium</hi> is more, or less, Diaphanous: and so they Incline to the Rays first Interrupted, or last Ingaged either in the lower <hi>Vmbo</hi> of a Convex, or <hi>Limbus</hi> of a Concave, or Indifferently of a Plane. But if they afterward In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tersect, yet the <hi>Focus</hi> will never be a Point; becaus, as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of an Image, the Perpendicular Ray doth alway caus some Latitude therof. And this I conceiv to be the Cours of Emanation of Rays of Light, which Naturaly is Circumferential, and when it is Interrupted, doth thus Converge as farr as it may, though it be also said to Diverge as in the Concave <hi>Speculum,</hi> becaus the Rays which so Converge to assist the Interrupted Rays one way, do indeed Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verge from others the other way; and the whole <hi>Limbus</hi> so Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting them they so Converge to every Point therof. And now as I have shewed the Motion of Emanant Light to be very Different from Corporeal Motion of Matter, so I shall also shew that any Light is not only Motion, or Puls of the <hi>Diaphanum,</hi> or som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that kind, which others have affirmed it to be, whereby I suppose they Intend also a Corporeal Motion, which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready disproved; but yet as I have particularly discoursed of the Motion of Heat, so I shall now also of Light; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinly if Heat be a Motion, and Light also a Motion, they may not be one and the same Motion; for then Heat should be Light, and Light Heat; and so we should not need to argue any farther par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly concerning Light, having argued it already against Heat: but I do acknowledg them to be several and Different Qualitys of Aether, and desire such who affirm them to be Motions to assigne their several and Different Local Motions, which if they be seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Different, must Impede and Obstruct one another, as I have said; for Heat and Light are Localy United <hi>per omnia,</hi> and therefore their Local Motions must be also <hi>per omnia,</hi> as a Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beam or Flame are very Lucid, and very Hott <hi>per omnia.</hi> And now let any such satisfie themselvs how the same Body, in the same Place, and the same Time, can Possibly Move by several Motions <hi>per omnia Puncta.</hi> Again, if the Motion of Light consydered di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly by itself be only a Corporeal Puls, then it must be so Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by some other Corporeal Mover, and then they must also assigne some particular Motions and Impressions of the Body Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:61550:98"/>
whereby it doth so Impell the Body Moved, as to Generate Light; otherwise any Body that Moves the <hi>Diaphanum</hi> in any maner might, as well as the Sun, thereby Generate Light; and Collision of Icicles should Generate it and Heat, as well as of Flint and Steel. Also let them shew what Connatural Analogy there is between these two very Different Motions of Circulation, and Collision, which yet do both Generate Light. But I suppose I may fully satisfy them with one Consyderation, which is, that the Motion of Emanant Light is so Swift and Momentaneous, that there is no Corporeal Mover in Nature which may Move the <hi>Diaphanum</hi> so swiftly, certeinly the Motion of the Sun is Comparatively, as Rest and Sloth in respect therof, and therefore can not Generate Light by his Impulses; becaus the Pulses Caused thereby can not be Swifter then the first Impressions. And though it be true that any Consistent Body, though never so long being Moved in any Part or Point, is Moved in the Whole, almost Instantaneously and Simultaneously, becaus it is Consistent; yet Air, which is the great <hi>Diaphanum</hi> and Vehicle of Light, is not Consistent, but Fluid; and so is Aether; as I have before shewed: and a Ship sailing in Water, which is more Consistent then either of them, doth not Move it many Leuks; as a Stone thrown into a Calm Sea will not make Circles therin many Miles: much less can the Circumgyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or any other Motion of the Sun, Caus such Pulses in all the vast Aether, Air, and Water, and wheresoever there is any Aethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Light. Nor doth every Motion of one Body in another make a Commotion and Puls therin: as a most smooth Globe turning round in Air or Water doth not Impell much, nor make any great Friction or Attrition, but only slideth by the Ambient Body; and the more Swiftly it so Moveth, the less Commotion it maketh in any other Body; or as an Intire and Solid Bullet flying in the Air maketh litle or no Nois, which is only made by Commotion, as I shall shew heerafter.

               <p n="4">IV. Having discovered such a Quality in Nature as Opacity, which is Contrary to Light, though it be not so Conspicuous, and therefore is not so much regarded, but denied or neglected by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as many such Antiqualitys, as I may so call them, are, becaus they are not so Agile and Active as their Contrary Qualitys, but are for Contemperation &amp; Fixation therof; I shall now proceed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syder this Opacity in the Mistion therof with Light, whereby it doth so Contemper, and Fix it, and whereby also we may very plainly discover it. For as the Mistion of the fower Elements doth Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce so many Various Quintessential <hi>Composita</hi> by the Production and Actuation of perhaps more then fower several Qualitys in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them, and Variation of them, and their several Degrees, according to that Arithmetical Rule of Changes, which I formerly mentioned, so particularly the very Mistion of Light and Opaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Various Degrees therof, Produce many notable Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations. And so not only Color generaly is Produced by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Mistion therof, but all particular Colors by the particular
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:61550:99"/>
Variations therof. And first as I have shewed Light itself could not Exist without some Opacity, and much less be Visible without it, any more then Opacity without Light; and therefore Light Objective and Visible doth always appear in some Color or other, whether it be Direct, as in the Sun, which is a Radiant Yellow, and in the Moon, which is White, and the Aether, which is Blew, or of some such Colors; or Reflex, as in the Rainbow, wherin all those Simple and other Mist Colors do appear; and though Light which is not Objective doth cast a Brightnes, and Darknes a Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and thereby may Intend or Remit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Colors, yet they Caus not any Color, more then Colors them, which yet cast some such Proportionable Brightnes, or Sadnes, as Rooms Painted White, or Black; but the Light of the Sun Reflected from Water is Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and the Moon White, and the Aether Blew, (which also ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Seas and Hills at a distance in Sude Weather to appear Blew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish) though, as I have said, Density and Profundity are also in that Aethereal Blewnes Analogous, and somwhat Assistant, to Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene Opacity, as Rarity and Tenuity are to the Aethereal Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. But if the Common Light (though that also have some small Misture of Opacity) were Visible in itself without Opacity, we should see nothing besides it, as we can not well see through Flame which is Objective Light; wheras Light doth render all things Visible, and more Visible by the greater Illustration therof; and so it is said to be <hi>Actus Diaphani,</hi> rendring it Actualy Perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous, which was Potentialy such before in itself; and so also it doth Actuate the Visibility of Fixed Colors, but not the Colors themselvs which are Fixed by Mistion Internaly in themselvs; and doth Externaly Illustrate them exceedingly by any greater Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes therof. But Light passing through Painted Glass is by the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on therewith, and Direct <hi>Species</hi> of the Colors also passing through it, with the Direct Rays of Light, Imperfectly Tinged; as the Yellow and Blew of the two several Painted Glasses is by the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Union therof; and such Tinged Rays of Light being Reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are Visibly Colorous; becaus they were Tinged before by their Passage and Penetration through the Body of the Diaphanous Glass: and so being Localy United with the Inherent Color of the Glass, the Emanant Color or <hi>Species</hi> and the Light Emanant after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward continues to be so United, whereby the Light becomes Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous; as when we look through a Painted Glass and Inherent

And if the Emanant Light be not Radiant it is not Colorous, or if it be not first United with the Inherent Light in the Colorate Body then it is not Colored at all, as in the Reflection of Light from a Colored Wall: and so also if it be only Reflected from the Outward <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Painted Glass, and not Transmitted through it, so that the Wall or Glass is the Object of our Sight, and the Common Light serveth only to Actuate the Visibility therof, and is not Colorous and Objective in itself, or in its own Rays; and yet if they be Conspissated by passing through a <hi>Fora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> or <hi>Lens,</hi> or by R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject doth not appear beyond it, becaus the Rays do not Penetrate
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:61550:100"/>
the Profundity. And these Local Unions of Light and Opacity, or of Light and Colors, which are partly Opacous, being Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualy only External though Localy Internal Unions <hi>per omnia,</hi> do not Produce a Perfect Mistion or Generation, as I have shewed, and therefore are Momentany being Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And such is the Momentaneous Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and Corruption of some Colors which are therefore truly called Desultory, but wheras they are called Apparent, I can also admitt it in respect of the general Nature of Color which is to make Objects to Appear at Distance, by the Contact of their Emanant <hi>Species</hi>; and so indeed all Colors may be termed Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; but any such Distinction as is by some made between Colors themselvs, Real, or Apparent, as though some Colors were not Real, I can not admit; and though some affirm only Fixed Colors to be Real, and others deny even the Reality of them, I must affirm both Fixed and Desultory to be Real, according to my Rule, which I have formerly sett down; and so certeinly they are both Realy in Nature, and Real Objects of our Sens, and not only in our Mind and Reason; like the Fantastical <hi>Species</hi> of Colors which Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholike and Madmen do Imaginate and Contemplate, and which are the only Apparent Colors that I know (becaus they are only <hi>Species</hi> and Images therof and no Real Colors in themselvs) unles we also acknowledg all Mankind to be as Fantastical, as some such indeed are, and the Assertors of this Opinion make themselvs to be, and none to have any true and Real Sens and Sight: for let these Desultory Colors in the same Position, and with all the same Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, be Inspected by a thousand Sane Men one after another, and they shall all give in the same Verdict of them, which shews that they are Realy such in their own Nature, and there is not, nor can there be, in any Man any other Sensation therof: wheras any Infirmity of Sens may be rectified by a rectified Sensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as I shall shew heerafter; and though they were only Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasms, as the others in Imagination, yet they should be Real Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasms, or <hi>Entia Sensationis,</hi> as I have said. Thus let the Yellow and Blew Glasses be always laid over one another and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and you shall alway see a Green through them against the Sun, by that Local Union, as well as of any Green Produced by a Spiritual Union of both those Colors, by dying, or the like: and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:61550:101"/>
though as their Generation is Momentany, so their Corruption may also be, yet you may continue them as long time as you pleas to continue the Local Union. And so also more Fixed Colors made by several Infusions of Chymical Spirits may be almost as Momentaneously Generated and Corrupted, and yet if any Chymist shall therefore deny such Fixed Colors to be Real, I desire him to reconsyder Flame, which is as Momentaneously Generated and Corrupted in the Successive Individualitys therof every Moment, and I suppose he will not deny Flame to be Real, (which is the chief Instrument of his Art) and Sound certeinly is a Real Sensible, and yet never fixed but Desultory. But the true Difference between them is, as I have said, that Desultory Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors are Generated only by Local Union Extrinsecaly, and Fixed Colors by Spiritual Mistion Intrinsecaly; and therefore Desultory Colors, wherof External Light is one Principle, as in the Prism, <hi>Iris,</hi> Pigeons Neck, and the like, have not only their Visibility, but also their very Coloration Actuated by the External Light; as in the Yellow &amp; Blew Glasses laid over one another, which yet are not made Green without the Transmission of the Light through both: so that indeed all Desultory Colors are Actuated by External Light, but Fixed Colors are Actualy in themselvs what they are, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any External Light, which doth only Actuate the Visibility thereof whereby they Appear to our Sight by drawing forth the Visible <hi>Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

as it doth Actuate the Visibility of both the Colors Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naly, but I suppose that as it doth pass together in the same Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Rays with the Heat, and so meet with the Internal Light of the White, the Whitenes, which is more Lucid in itself doth, as all Homogeneous Natures, Univocaly Conspire with it and Dilate itself therewith, which is called a Segregation of Rays, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Heat in the same Rays is also Diffused, and so Weakned, and therefore can not Operate so Intens<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And thus they make all Colors to be only certein Desultory Variati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the External Light upon the <hi>Superficies</hi> of Bodys, and the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:61550:102"/>
of the most Noble Sens to be only a fictitious Imposture, affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Black to be from the Suffocation of the Rays by an Unequal and Porous <hi>Superficies,</hi> and White the Contrary, and so all other Intermediate Colors only more or less such Suffocations of the Rays; which is most Sensibly fals, if we may believ our own Eys; for Snow is most Porous, and yet most White, Jett polished least Porous, and yet most Black; and so Painted Glass is either White or Black, and yet the Rays Penetrate more through the White then the Black, and both of them are apparently White and Black in themselvs before, and without any such Penetration; and so Bodys of a like Surface are Indifferently either White or Black; as polished Marble, Skins of <hi>Europaeans,</hi> and <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> and the like. All which may also Chymicaly be Demonstrated by the Generation of Colors in Flame; which though they are as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaneous as the Flame, yet are no otherwise Desultory then the Flame itself, as I have said; wherin, when the <hi>Fomes</hi> therof, as the Wax, or Tallow of a Candle, is first Incensed, there is before it be Inflamed or below the Flame a manifest Black, and so in the <hi>Fuligo,</hi> and assoon as it is Inflamed a Blew, and in the purest Flame, a White, and in that which is in the <hi>Cuspis,</hi> a Yellow, and if it be very Fuliginous, Red, (which is also very manifest in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bust Fire of the Wike) whereby it plainly appears that Black is from a Terrene Quality in the <hi>Fomes,</hi> and <hi>Fuligo</hi>; and White from the Aethereal Quality of the Flame: wherof I call the one Opacity, and the other Light; though both of these be Mist toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as all the Elements and their Contrary Qualitys are; but Opacity is notably Predominant in Black, and Light in White, and all other Simple Colors are only Gradual Predominations of either of them; as Blew of less Opacity and more Light then Black; and Yellow of less Light and more Opacity then White; and I suppose Red to be a more Intens and CondensYellow, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps of a midle Degree between Yellow and Blew, as seems by Local Union of any <hi>Fuligo</hi> with Yellow which renders it more Reddish; but certeinly it is not Mist of both, for that is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Color, which is Green, as Gray is of Black and White; and so all other Compounds, and Decompounds, which Painters, and Diers, make of these Simple Colors. And as these Meteori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Colors, so also all other more Perfect Generations of Fixed Colors are by Actuating the Internal Lucidity or Opacity therof,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:61550:102"/>
more, or less: and their Corruption by Reducing it into Potenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality. As the most White Wood by Actuating the Fuliginous Opa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city therof in Charking becomes a Black Coal; and when that <hi>Fuligo</hi> is Emitted by Burning, it becomes again a Whitish Ash, or Grey, Mist of both.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The Antecedent Darknes, which was in the first <hi>Chaos,</hi> was the Pure Evening therof, before any Light, which was Created after it; and therefore Light, rather then Heat, is particularly mentioned in the Work of this First Day; becaus thereby this, and all Successive Days, were made and Divided into Day and Night Artificial; as it followeth therupon, <hi>And God Divided the Light from the Darkness,</hi> &amp;c. And so in this whole History of the Creation (which is as the Decalog, and the like, very Compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and Comprehensive) though only some more General or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal things be mentioned, yet all others that are Coordinate and Connatural must also be Intended: and certeinly there never was any System of the World declared and described either more tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or in a more short <hi>Epitome.</hi> Now wheras the Antecedent Darknes did continue for some Time on the face of the Deep, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Spirit of God Moved upon it, it may be Curiously Inquired, how long that Space of Time was, wherin the Antecedent Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes was and continued, before the first Light was Created? but as Divine Wisedom doth not regard Human Curiosity, nor attend to satisfy it, so I esteem it Impertinent, though I may discours it <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitus.</hi> However I must conceiv, as I have said, that the Spirit of God did not only Move or Incubate on the first <hi>Chaos</hi> to Prepare and Predispose it before and untill the Light was Created, but Conformably untill all the other Original Creatures in all the Six Days were Produced, and the whole Creation and Cours of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture finished: for they were all Supernatural and the Immediate Works of God. And concerning the particular Space of Time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the General and Proper Creation or Begining, and the first Improper Creation of Light, I conceiv it probably to have been Twelv Hours, and somwhat more, and that there was neither any Diurnal, nor any Nocturnal Light, during that Time: For so the Computation of all the Six Days is by Evening and Morning aswell as of the First; and the Evening and Morning made the First Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Day Natural, which most probably was Equinoctial, and was
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:61550:103"/>
afterward Divided into Day and Night Artificial; and the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is alway sett before the Morning, as it was before it in Time, but the Day before the Night, as it is before it in Nature; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus the Day Artificial was first so made by Dividing the Light from the Darknes, that is, into a Diurnal, and Nocturnal Light, and so God saith, <hi>I form the Light and Create Darknes,</hi> as he did in the First Day Originaly; wheras Pure Darknes is not Creable, but the Night which is called Dark Comparatively. Wherefore as this Improper Creation in the Six Days was Original Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherunto all Successive is Conformable, so I suppose that as the whole Day, according to the Diurnal Cours of the Aether then first putt into Motion, and so still continuing is fower and twenty Hours and somwhat more; so the two Halvs therof, or first Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Morning must be supposed to have been also of the same Duration, and each of them Equal, as well as the Second and Third, before the Sun and Moon were Created. Nor can I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv how there could be any such Day and Night Artificial in the First Day, as since; becaus they were then first so Created after the first Evening was ended; but could not Possibly be before they were so Created: And when Light was Created it was Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all the Aether in respect of the Precedent Evening, and so there was never since any such Evening and Morning, as made the first Day Natural: becaus there is no such Pure Darknes, but only Comparative Darknes, whereby Night was made after the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was ended, by the first Creation of Light, which was the first Morning; and God in that Morning did afterward Divide the Light into a Diurnal and Nocturnal Proportion therof, whereby he made Day and Night Artificial. And thus, though Time was Created in the Begining, from whence also the most Proper Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Day did Commence, yet the Artificial was Created in that First Natural Day; and the Day Natural according to the Cours of the Sun in the Fourth Day, and the two Parts of that Day which we commonly but more Improperly call Day Natural, that is, Night and Day are not always Equal with the Parts of all other Days: wheras the two Parts of the Proper Day Natural, that is, the Evening and Morning being Computed from the Begining are always Equal and each of them Twelv Hours and somwhat more. And becaus the Parts of the Solar or Improper Day Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, except Equinoctial, are Unequal, therefore the Whole may
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:61550:103"/>
be sooner as in Summer, or later as in Winter; but the Proper Natural Day is never sooner or later, becaus it is the Succession of Fower and Twenty Hours Daily from the first Fower and Twenty Hours, and Begining of the first Day Natural: and so all the Six Days both before and after the Sun and Moon were made to Rule the Day and Night, and also the Seaventh or Sabbath are Computed accordingly. Wherefore becaus this Day is most Even Exact and Invariable according to Time, God also appointed it, and not the Improper Day Natural, to be the Measure of Time <hi>in Sacris,</hi> and so it is said <hi>from Even to Even shall ye cele<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now as there was not only a Proper Natural Day, but also a Division therin of the Light from the Comparative Darknes, and so Day and Night Artificial made thereby in the First Day Originaly, and Successively in the Second and Third Day, before the Sun or Moon were made to Rule them, more particularly, as I shall shew heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; so certeinly there must have been some Circumrotation of the Aether, and of the Light Inherent therin in the Precedent Days; for if the Light were Equaly in all the Aether, then there should have been Equaly all Day in all the Ae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Certeinly the Earth, Water, or Air, or any of them could not so Move in this First Day, becaus they were not yet Improperly Created, or so Made, as it is said of the Air that God <hi>Made</hi> or fitted <hi>the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament</hi> therof, or <hi>Expansum,</hi> in the Second Day, (though they were Properly Created in the Begining in their several Bodys and Spheres) but were then all in Rest, and only the Spirit of God Moved among them, and as the Irregular Winds, and the Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Courses of the Tides and of the Sun, Moon and Starrs were not before, or untill those other Elementary Bodys were Improperly Created, so neither was there any Motion of the Earth; wherof if we could suppose any such Motion, yet we may not reasonably suppose it to have been before the Third Day, and Improper Creation of the Earth therin; concerning which I shall Discours heerafter, and now only add one other Observation; that as the Sun, though farr less then one Hemisphere of the Aether, yet maketh Day therin by his Emanant Rays, so probably the Diurnal Light in this First Day did not fill one whole Hemisphere, but only some such part therof, as according to the Vigor and Extent of the Emanant Rays therof did make Day Artificial in one Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphere, and perhaps with some such <hi>Crepuscula,</hi> as the Sun now doth make, for we may well conceiv, that First Day and Night to have been Analogous to every Day since in all the general Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances therof (besides only such as are more specialy superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the Variations of sooner, or later, more, or less, by the Courses of the Sun and Moon) wheras if that Diurnal Light Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent should have filled one whole Hemisphere, the Emanant Rays therof would have extended much farther, and the Inherent Light should have been Hemispherical, which is not Conformable to the Natural Figure therof: and therefore I rather conceiv, that it was a Particular Globe <hi>Glomus</hi> or <hi>Confluvium</hi> collected from the Light, which was first Generaly and Diffusively Created in the whole Aether, and that which was left in the common Body therof is therefore Comparatively called Darknes; and though it were not strictly such Darknes, as was in the <hi>Chaos,</hi> yet the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression is not therefore Popular, so as some would make all the Philosophical Expressions in Scripture to be but Necessarily to be
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:61550:104"/>
so understood, for there are no <hi>Purae Tenebrae</hi> in the whole Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Nature, and in the Superaether there is either a Superaethereal Light, or neither Light, nor Darknes; for where there is not, nor Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaly ought to be any Positive, there is no Privative, which is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Positive, &amp; is only the Privation therof; as in a Stone there is neither Sight nor Blindnes: wherefore after the first Creation of Light, that Darknes must necessarily be understood of Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Darknes only; and this is the Natural Darknes which God Created, and is also sufficiently so explained in the ensuing words, <hi>And the Darknes he called Night,</hi> which hath its Nocturnal Light: whereby it is expressly and most exactly Distinguished from a Pure Privation of Light, such as was Antecedently in the <hi>Chaos,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there was neither Day nor Night. And heer again Cavillation, which is endles, may proceed to term these Expressions, <hi>God Said,</hi> or <hi>Called,</hi> and the like, Popular; though as the others, so these also are most Necessary; for indeed nothing can be Properly spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of God, either as he is in Essence, or in Operation, and there can be no Expression more apposite, then that the Creatures are <hi>Verba Mentis Divinae.</hi> And heer I must affirm of this whole History of Creation that it is not Popular, as some would have it, and thereby render it Insignificant unto all others, as well as to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs; whereby they have lost the Benefit of so great a Treasure, which hath been a <hi>Chaos</hi> to this Day, and is still hid from the Wise and Prudent; or rather they thus hide it from themselvs: though I am confident that neither themselvs, nor any other, can ever declare or describe such a System of the World in more brief or less Popular Expressions. Wherefore I term it a Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that is, of Matter of Fact; which hath only such apt Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions as serv to declare and describe the Matter of Fact, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore certeinly are not Popular; otherwise we may call all the Sacred History of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> of <hi>Noah,</hi> of <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and of all the Patriarchs, Judges, and Kings, and Governors, and of <hi>Christ</hi> and his Apostles, Popular; and reject all the Matters of Fact Recorded both in the Old, and New Testament, and our very Creed; which should be most Irreligious and also Irrational. Thus when God saith, <hi>In the Begining he Created the Heaven and the Earth</hi>; shall any say, he did not, and so of the rest? And if any may be so Irreligious as to deny the Verity of the Fact, yet he may not be so Irrational as to deny the Veracity of the Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:61550:105"/>
or to affirm that the Scripture doth not say, that <hi>In the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God Created the Heaven and the Earth,</hi> and so of the rest. But that we may not frame any Popular Notion of what we intend by a Popular Expression, and so Confound our Discours therof, as I have hitherto strictly examined other Terms and Expressions, so I shall also now examin this very Expression of an Expression. And I acknowledg generaly all Language to be Popular; becaus Words are no Natural Signatures, but only Instituted <hi>Tesserae,</hi> or <hi>Symbola</hi> of Things, Coined by Men, and so made to pass Current among themselvs. And since the Confusion of Languages every National Language is more particularly Popular, or peculiar to the People of that Nation; and the same Word may signify one Thing in one Tong, and another in another; as <hi>Nay</hi> in <hi>English</hi> hath a Contrary Signification in <hi>Greek.</hi> Wherefore I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg also that there is such Popularity in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tong, and also many Idiotisms therof, as well as in others; but I suppose this is not the Popularity Intended; for then we should also Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidate all Language as well as this, and all Books as well as the Bible. Also there are certein General Propertys and Modificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all Human Language, as well as several Idiotisms of Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Languages. As that which is spoken Respectively of any Thing, or in one Respect, according to that which is the Subject Matter of the present Discours, can not reasonably by any Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Men in any Language be Interpreted Absolutely, or in all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects whatsoever. And so again, as I have before noted, that which no Human Language can Properly Express may not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably by any Rational Men be Interpreted Properly, and the like; which if we should not allow, we should destroy all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Discours; and otherwise then so, I know not one Popular Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression in this whole History of the Creation; and such Populari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty also is, and must be, in any other History of Matter of Fact: and therefore this can be no reason why any should regard it less then any other Philosophical Discourses whatsoever. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they must rather Intend by Popular Expressions such as are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to false Apprehensions of Common People, or Decepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Sens, and the like; and I suppose, they can not shew any one such in all this Narration, and indeed it is great Impiety to conceiv that there should be any such in it, which doth so Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caly and Intentionaly declare and describe the <hi>Genesis</hi> of the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:61550:105"/>
World: though in other parts of the Scripture, which are not so Historical and Intentional, I also acknowledg that there are all the Varietys of Human Language, and so there are many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions which are spoke, as we say <hi>Rotunde,</hi> and so indeed Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly for common Use, and such as are allowed in all Arts and Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, even Mathematical; and many Figurative Expressions, yea Hyperbolical and Ironical, in some more Poetical and Rhetorical parts therof; which yet may as easily be discerned as in any ordinary Discours: but certeinly the Divine Verity doth not any where offer any thing of Falsity or Deception, but Expresseth most In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Truth in the common Language of Mankind, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly according to those Tongs, wherin it is writ; and most Wisely Ordereth and Varieth the Expressions according to the Occasion and Intention therof: and so heer concerning the <hi>Genesis</hi> of the World it speak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

litle more satisfaction from it then from any other Human Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy; though it be the only Standard of Truth, and the first Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence therof, <hi>In the Begining,</hi> &amp;c. the very <hi>Alpha</hi> of all Divine Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the Foundation of all that Divinity, and Morality, or our whole Duty toward God and Man that is conteined in the whole Scripture: whereby it plainly appears how firm a Connexion there is between Theology, Morality, and Natural Philosophy; and of what Consequence and Concernment, according to Divine Wisdom, a right and sound Knowledg therof is both in Church, and State: and I dare affirm that there never was extant in the World any other Writing that hath more firmly and plainly laid the Foundations of these three most Noble and Profitable Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences: and as it is my Designe to Demonstrate it even in Natural Philosophy, (which perhaps men may least expect,) so I may sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, if I shall perform and obtein this, they will easily grant it of the others: And I hope, though I may fall short of mine own Intention and their Satisfaction, yet I shall discover so much Light therof, that others will begin to believ that more may be derived from this Fountain, and so proceed to perfect what I have begun. Certeinly whatsoever is in this Sacred History, is Truth, and all that Truth is Fundamental, wherupon Human Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son (to which God hath left the rest for the Exercitation and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement therof) may proceed to build; but other Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then this can no Man lay. And though the Divine Spirit in Inditing it did not intend to satisfy the more Curious and Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, yet such things as no Memory of Man hath otherwise Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served and Delivered, nor our Reason and Judgment could have Retrived, are heer clearly Reveled, and faithfully Recorded. As not only that there was a Creation and a Begining, but how many Thousand Years since, and all the Succeeding Chronology of the World, and the whole Order and Process of Created Nature, how it was first Ordained and Instituted in Six several Days, and the like: and as all Christian Historians have rectified the Fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Chronology of Pagans by the former, so should Christian Philosophers their Contradictory and Unsatisfactory Philosophy by the latter. But again on the other hand we must carefully avoid all Cabalistical and Allegorical Interpretations therof, and satisfy our selvs with the plain and simple Sens of the Text, according to the Subject Matter therof, and Context of Scripture. And thus
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:61550:106"/>
wheras the Rabbins from those former Expressions, <hi>God said,</hi> and <hi>God called it,</hi> and the like, have asserted the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, wherin this History of the Creation was writ by <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Names of Day, Night, Heaven, Sea, Earth, and the like, which are said thus to be Named by God, to be therefore the Primitive Language Instituted by God, and Original of all others, I dare not so affirm, though I otherwise grant it to be the most antient of all Languages now Extant, becaus that Book is the most antient of all Books now Extant. But God is also said to <hi>call the Starrs by their Names,</hi> though all of them be not Expressed: for their Names to him who is the Creator of all things are their Created
Natures, by which he knows them Immediately and Essentialy, and so he speaks by Real Language, or by his Works, which, as I have said, are the Extrinsecal and Artificial Words of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Mind, and his Word is only a Comment therupon, and so the Heaven and Earth were Denominated by their Created Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and when he made Day and Night, he so denominated them by making them to be such. And heerin Divine Language and Human Differ; for wheras <hi>Adam</hi> afterward gave Names unto the Creatures, he only Verbaly called them by some Instituted Names, Expressive of such Natures as God had made them; but did no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, nor could Realy make them to be such. And the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Language, whatsoever it was, may rather be referred to him; for it is Mans Creature, and of Human Institution; and possibly he might speak that Language: and so it is said, <hi>Adam</hi> called his wife <hi>Chevah,</hi> and she her son <hi>Sheth.</hi> However it is certein they both spake some Language, which also declares the great Perfection of their Created Witt, which could so soon frame such a Common Language whereby they understood one another, and that must be Primitive, becaus they were the first Man and Woman. And if God afterward spake unto them Vocaly and <hi>Humanitus,</hi> he also spake their Language, by which they might understand him: And it is expressly said that God brought the Beasts and Fowls to <hi>Adam, To see what he would Call them: And whatsoever Adam Called every Living Creature, that was the Name therof. And Adam gave Names to all Catell, and to the Fouls of the Air, and to every Beast of the Field:</hi> so that plainly all these Names were Instituted Originaly by <hi>Adam,</hi> and not by God himself Immediately, who is said to bring them unto him, <hi>To see what he would Call them</hi>; that
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:61550:107"/>
is, to Exercise his Human Facultys both of Speech and Reason: and accordingly <hi>Adam</hi> did give to every one his Specifical Name, and <hi>that was the Name therof.</hi> Therefore wheras they make the Divine Institution of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language to be the Foundation of their <hi>Cabal,</hi> that very Foundation is too Cabalistical, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to be proved: and perhaps though that Language generaly were Primitive, yet the Dialect therof, as of all others, might be much Altered before the Confusion, but especialy after it, and most probably it was first spoken without the Character, which they also make to be Cabalistical. And there are some such Criticks who accuse the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language itself of many Defects; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore certe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore as, I conceiv, there is nothing Mystical or Caba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listical in Numbers, so neither in Letters or Figures, or any other Quantitys; and as there is only a plain Signature of the Notion rather then of the Thing in any such Literal Characters, so also in Words which are only Sounds. And so the Names which <hi>Adam</hi> gave, did signify only Notionaly and Intellectualy; whereby al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so it appears, that he had a most Perfect Philosophical Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Inspection of their Natures, according to his most Perfect Reason and Natural Understanding: which God, who had Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Intellective Spirit, and given him Dominion thereby over all Sensitive and Inferior Natures, brought these most Curious and D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:61550:107"/>
according to his Perfect Human Nature in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct State therof wherin he was Created. But yet I do not conceiv that he did know, or could even then know such things as are Naturaly in themselvs Indemonstrable and Incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to any Human Reason, as Mathematical Points, and other <hi>Asymmetra,</hi> which yet are the very least and lowest of Entitys; becaus, as I have shewed, they are Demonstrably Indemonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and were purposely so secreted by God for the Humiliation of Man in his most Perfect State, and for the Admiration of himself Seen in his meanest Workmanship: for as there is still left in Nature <hi>Veritas in Profundo,</hi> for the Exercise of Human Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Study, and it is Sloth and Idlenes in us not to D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Expansum,</hi> as well as the Aether, and also Heaven, as well as the Superaether. And becaus it is the next and Immediate Heaven to us, therefore the general Name of Heaven is according to Hebraical Etymology most Proper and Peculiar to it, though the Superaether be the most Stupendous Excellent Heaven in its own Nature, as I have said. And as we generaly call all that is above us Heaven, so in that respect this is the First Heaven, Aether the Second, and Superaether the Third. But it is in itself very Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from both them above it, and also from Water, and Earth below it; and as Different from all the other Elements, as they are generaly one from another, becaus they are several Elements; though particularly as they are neerer in Situation, so also in Nature one to another. And Air is of a Midle Nature between Aether and Water, as Water is between Air and Earth; and so consydered with the Aethereal Rays Emanant into it may be called an Aeriaethereous Sphere, and with the Vapors and the <hi>Effluvia</hi> therof Ascending into it an Aquaereous Sphere, as Water and Earth are a Terraqueous Globe. And though becaus it hath Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualy less Sensible Qualitys then Aether, and a less Dens or Gross Body then Water (so that any Vessel filled with it is Compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Also though it be farr more Rare then Water which is supposed to be about a thousand times more Dens then the Atmosphere ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Common Temper therof, and may be many times more Dens then Air Rarefied or Expanded; yet perhaps as Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Earth do more agree in Density, so also Air and Aether (which are both called <hi>Expansa</hi>) in Rarity. But as Air is thus Rare, so it is not only capable of Compression more then Water, but also of Dilatation or Expansion more then Aether; which Expansion therof is now made famous by the Name of Elast<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:61550:110"/>
indeed they have both only their own Proper Regions, which are several, becaus they are both of several Density and Rarity, and of several Elementary Natures; and so with the other two Divide the whole Elementary Globe into their fower several Provinces, as I have shewed; and if any could shew us any such Division Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal, and Spiritual, or either of them, in the Aether or Air them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs, they should Prove what they Say, and not only Say what they Imagin. But though no Colorable Caus be offered to make such Partitions in Aether, except the Various Motions of the Sydereous Bodys, which Move in the Aether, and are Moved with the Aether, and need no such Proper Spheres, as I have shewed; yet there is a more Sensible Pretension to prove Three several Regions in the Air, which will be also found to be like them in the Aether, only in Notion, and not in Nature: for wheras they assigne the First Region to be and extend so farr as the Emanant Rays of Aether are Reflected from the Earth, the Midle to be where that Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction endeth, and wherin the Meteors are, and the Third above them, and so Immediately Contiguous to the Aether; I find no such Partition therof, neither in the Text, nor in Nature. For them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs do not apprehend the First Region to be many Miles high, (nor indeed can it be of any great Hight, if it be below all Mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, Vapors, Dews, and the like, which continualy Ascend into it from the Terraqueous Globe, and are not very high) but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinly the Rays are Reflected much farther then any hath yet as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed the utmost Hight of the whole Air to be. It is reported that the Pike of <hi>Teneriff,</hi> and some such other Eminences of the Earth, may be seen at the Distance of about three Degrees from them, which can not be by the Direct Rays therof, being no Lucid Bodys, and therefore must be by the Reflected Rays of Aether, which are Reflected so farr through the Air; otherwise there could be no Vision of the Object at such a Distance: though indeed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection be farr shorter then Direct Emanation, (and perhaps there may be some such Proportions therof, as there are of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent and Reflected Motion of any Ball or Stone from a Paviment.) And therefore we can not see so farr by the Reflected Rays of a Candle in the Night, as we may see the Candle itself by the Direct Rays therof. Now Heat is a Congenerous Quality of Light, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manant with it in the same Aethereal Rays, as appears by the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:61550:110"/>
by the Opacity therof, which is not Contrary therunto, but to Light, and is only hindered by the Density, and so may not be Reflected altogether so much, becaus it Penetrates more (which also proves Heat and Light to be several Qualitys) yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinly Heat can not so farr fall short of the Light, but rather there is some Degree of Heat Reflected with the Light unto the very Aether, though Proportionably less; and then, according to their own assignment, there is but one Region of the Air. Again the Vapors of Water are said to Ascend above the Airy <hi>Expansum</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely, which may be to the utmost Hight therof, as well as all over it: and as there are Bright and Dry Clouds above the Moist, and <hi>Stellae Cadentes,</hi> and Comets, and the like, above them, so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably other Tenuious and Invisible Vapors above them; and then also, according to their own assignment, there is but one Region of the Air; and they who assigne must prove that there are not any Meteors or Vapors above their Second Region assigned, which they can never do. But the truth is, that though the Aethereal Rays be Reflected from Earth to Aether, yet that Reflection both of Light and Heat, as all others, is stronger and longer as it is neerer, and weaker and shorter as it is farther from the Body Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting; as well as Emanation is stronger as it is neerer, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er as it is farther from the Body of the Inherent Quality which doth Emitt it: and so the Reflection of the Aethereal Rays from the Terraqueous Globe back again to the Ae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>her is Gradual, and of different Degrees; and thereby doth Produce Different De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Vapors, and several sorts of Meteors in several parts of the Air; and accordingly they attein several Situations therin; and by the Variation of many Circumstantial Causalitys the same Meteors poised therin almost as Glass Bubbles in Water are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times higher, and sometimes lower, and have no such Planetary Position in themselvs, as Starrs in Aether: nor is the Air so Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable as it. The Spirit of Air is not Exprest by any known Name, and I know not therefore well how to Express it, unles we should call it, <hi>Aura:</hi> or the like. And indeed Philosophers generaly have so much attended the Gross Matter, and so litle regarded Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Spirits, that they have not so much as found out any <hi>Vocabu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:61550:111"/>
which yet hath not been Determined concerning all the Elements, what are their first Proper Qualitys, as I shall heerafter shew, and particularly prove Cold to be the Proper Quality of Air<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as Heat is of Aether. Also Air hath apparently another Quality which is Sound, and that is very Sensible, almost as much as Light; but is not so much consydered, becaus it is not so Permanent; and indeed Sound is farr more Desultory then Color, as I have said, for though Desultory Color is not, and can not be, Fixed as an Image can not be fixed on a <hi>Speculum</hi> (which if it could be, would Excuse and Exceed the Art of any Painter) yet it may be Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the same Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And yet as all the other Heavens are Hebraicaly Denominated from this first Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Air, so also all Spirits from the Spirit therof, almost in all Languages. Air hath also a Mistion with all the other Elements as well as Aether, and perhaps more, as Water hath more then it, and Earth most of them all: and so it hath more of the Terrene Qualitys then Aether, and less then Water, as it hath more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fracting Opacity then the one, and less then the other; and so also more Consistence, then the one, and less then the other; and therefore is probably less Fluid then Aether, as it is apparently more Fluid then Water.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The Aether, as I have said, is most Rare, and probably can not be more Rarefied then it is in its own Element; and so the Earth most Dens, and can not be more Densified. And though I know not whether Aether may be more Densified, yet certeinly Earth may be very much Rarefied, as in Soot, Camphire, Salts Volatilised, and the like. But Water is most notably capable of Rarefaction into Vapors, and they are as much Condensated again into Waters, though I suppose it can not be so much Violently Expanded or Comprest, and that Air can not be so much Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densated or Rarefied as it may be Comprest or Expanded. And of all other Elements Air is most capable of Compression as in the Windgun, and of Expansion as in the Airpump: (which from thence may be rightly termed the <hi>Expansor</hi>) and from this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression and Expansion therof there follows a Natural <hi>Motus</hi> or
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:61550:111"/>
                  <hi>Nisus ad Restitutionem,</hi> or Resilience, which is now Superscribed with a new Title of Elasticity, though the Term properly signify rather Abaction or Pulsion then any such Return or Restitution, as is or ought to be Intended thereby, and in plain <hi>English</hi> is better termed Springines, which is more Proper to Compression then Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pansion; though as it is Confusedly used for both, I am forced also so to use it, only for more clearnes and distinction I shall rather ascribe Elasticity to Fluid Bodys, as Air, and the like, and Springines to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent, as Steel, and the like. But heer I must Remind what I have formerly Observed, that there is a very great Difference between Rarefaction and Condensation which are Spiritual, and by Intrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Generation, and Expansion and Compression which are Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real, &amp; by Extrinsecal Violence: which Difference doth most plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear by this very Elasticity: for no Elasticity and Motion or <hi>Nisus</hi> to Restitution doth ensue from the former, becaus they are so Intrinsecaly Altered by Natural Generation; whereby the Predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant Spirit having in the Generation reduced the Body to a fit Rarity or Density for itself, doth so continue it as long as it doth Predominate; but only from the latter, when only the Body is by any External Violence so Expanded or Comprest, and the Predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Spirit not Varied by Corruption, and therefore it reteineth still such an Actual <hi>Nisus</hi>; which, when the External Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence is removed, becomes a <hi>Motus ad Restitutionem.</hi> And yet both the former and the latter are generaly Confounded together, which hath so much Confounded the right Knowledg and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing therof: but being thus clearly Explained and Distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will very much facilitate and clear our Discours therof. And this may evidently appear in all the Experiments of Rarefaction and Condensation, or of Expansion and Compression. As first in the Sealed Weather-glass, which is the true <hi>Thermometer</hi> without any Communication with the External Air, and accordingly with the Variation of the Density or Rarity of the Body therof; from which it is defended by being so Sealed, and is only Varied in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self by Heat or Cold, which are Spiritual Qualitys, Penetrating the Glass, or Operating upon it by their Emanant Contact, and consequently upon the Water, or any other Liquor within it (which whatsoever it be, we will generaly call Water) and if Cold have no Emanant Rays like Heat, yet it may, as I have shewed, Generate Univocaly a Potential Cold in the Glass, and so thereby
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:61550:112"/>
also in the Water by Producing the Potential Cold therof into Actuality (as also Sound which is another Quality of Air Mist in the <hi>Compositum</hi> therof may be so Produced, as I shall shew heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.) And therefore the Water in the Sealed Weather-glass doth not Fall in Hotter Weather, nor Rise in Colder, as in the Open Weather-glass, but Contrarily Rise in Hotter, and Fall in Colder Weather; becaus the Included Water being Intrinsecaly Rarefied by the Heat doth Extrinsecaly Compress the Air, which also would itself be Rarefied, and hath therefore an Intrinsecal <hi>Nisus</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto in itself; but yet is Comprest Violently by the Water, which is more Dens and Robust in itself, and the Air more Rare and Tender in itself; and so again the Included Water being Intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secaly Condensated by Cold, doth Extrinsecaly Expand the Air, which also would of itself be so Condensated, and hath therefore an Intrinsecal <hi>Nisus</hi> therunto in itself; but yet is expanded Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently by the Water which is Condensated, and being more Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, as I have said, doth so Expand and draw down the Air to fill the Space which it hath left, <hi>Ne detur Vacuum.</hi> Also if the Sealed Weather-glass be carried up to the Top of the highest Steeple or Hill, where the External Air is much more Rare then at the Bottom, yet the Water will not suddenly Fall, as in an Open Weather-glass; becaus the Water and Air in the Sealed Weather-glass have no such Communication with the External Air, and the Corporeal Rarity or Density therof; but is only Rarefied or Condensated by Internal Heat, or Cold; and that can not so suddenly be Produced in it as to make any such Variations: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in the Open Weather-glass; becaus it is Open, the External Air doth Corporealy Communicate with the Included Air, and so by Mingling with it doth suddenly Vary the Rarity or Density therof, as Vinegar Mingled with thick Ink, or the like: And therefore the Included Air is suddenly Varied, and sooner by the Rarity or Density of the External Air, then by the Heat or Cold therof, which require more Time Univocaly to Generate Heat or Cold in the Included Air, whereby it may be Rarefied or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densated in itself: wheras if the External Air be Actualy more Rare, though more Cold (from other Circumstantial Causalitys, as in clear frosty Weather, or the like) the Included Air in the Open Weather-glass will also be more Rare; becaus, as I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it doth Communicate and Mingle with it; and so if it be more
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:61550:112"/>
Dens, though more Hott; as in a Minepitt, the Included Air will be also more Dens, for the same Reason; and consequently the Water will Fall in the former, and Rise in the latter Experiment, so that the Open Weather-glass is indeed rather a <hi>Pycnometer,</hi> as I may call it. Also in the common Experiment of drawing up Water in an Urinal or other Vessel by Flame, or heating the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, assoon as the Actual Flame, which did Actualy Rarefy it, is Extinct, the Air is again Condensated, and the Water will ascend suddenly, (or more slowly if it be heated,) and afterward so Mingle with the External Air, and Participate of the Rarity or Density therof, like any other such <hi>Pycnometer</hi>; for so it stands at that Hight wherunto it hath Ascended, and will be Varied af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward as in any Open Weather-glass by applying Heat to the outside of the Glass, which will make it to Fall, and when that is abated to Rise again, and not stand afterward as low as it Fell, as it doth at that Hight which it atteined by the Calefaction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And it is consyderable in this Experiment, that the Air is Rarefied so notably in the Glass by Flame or Fire within the Glass, together with all the Fume therof; and yet the Rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of both, which is Proportionably as much in Extension as the Water which Ascendeth afterward, doth not Depress it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the <hi>Stagnum</hi> therof in the Basin; wherefore certeinly it must pass out of the Glass, (whose Neck is filled and closed with the Water therin equaly with the Levell of the Water in the Basin, as the Top of the Torricellian Tube is with the Mercury that is in it) by some such ways and passages, as I shall heerafter disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and declare concerning the Torricellian Experiment. And it doth not depress the Water below the <hi>Stagnum</hi> therof in the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin, as Air Rarefied within an Open Weatherglass doth the Water therin below the Standard therof; becaus in this Experiment the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not having yet Ascended above the Levell therof in the Basin, doth not Superpend, nor hath any such <hi>Nisus</hi> to Return down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or descend, as in the Open Weather-glass, or Torricellian Tube, wherin the <hi>Cylinder</hi> of Water, or Mercury, doth so Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perpend upon and above the <hi>Stagnum,</hi> and therefore hath such a <hi>Nisus</hi> of Returning again Downward, as I shall also shew after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. And so also in this Experiment, after the Water hath Ascended in the Glass, and hath thereby such a <hi>Nisus</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning Downward again, if the Air above it within the Glass
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:61550:113"/>
be then Rarefied again by heating, or the like, the Water will fall as well as in any other Open Weather-glass, as I have shewed. And the true Reason heerof is not from any Natural Springe of the Air, or Abaction or Pulsion outwardly, as I before noted; becaus the Expansion is Violent and beyond the Natural Density of the Common Air, and the Restitution to it Inwardly Natural; as of bent Steel to its own Natural Figure: for that which is more Constant and Proper is Natural, and the other Violent.

the Air Outwardly in the Receiver wherin it is placed, the Mercury in the <hi>Stagnum</hi> is thereby drawn Outwardly Upward, and consequently it must Descend Inwardly Downward in the Tube (as that Engine is said to draw up a very great Weight) and yet it Proportionably also draws the Included Air at the other End, though not so freely, and therefore not so strongly, nor can so Communicate with it as the Rarefaction of the External Air doth not so freely Communicate with the Inte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nal Air, as I have said. And this I conceiv to be the true Reason of the Torricellian Experiment, and also of the Paschalian Experiment, which are the same Proportionably according to the Different Weight of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury and Water, and both of them Differ from the Common Open Weather-glass only in this, that they are Erected to the Highest Standard, which can be made of any such Experiments, wheras the Weather-glass is only a Partial Experiment; as when the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricellian Tube is shorter then the Standard, yet the Mercury will stand at that Hight: but a Pump doth Correspond with the Pascha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian Experiment, if it be as High; for the Water will not so stand therin above the Standard, though by Forcers and Buckets below the Standard, and the like, it may be raised higher, as the Waterwork at <hi>London</hi>-bridg; and I know a Pump neer the place where I dwell, which servs an hous with Water pumped up about fifty feet high, by making two Pump posts, wherof the lower is about two Inches Bore, and the upper about five with Poles, and a Bucket in it, and two Valvs at the Bottom of the Bucket and top of the lower Post. Also the <hi>Siphon,</hi> as to this Purpose, is only a double Pump or double Tube Inverted. But the great Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning the Torricellian Experiment hath been, how the Air should come into the Tube, and Ascend above the Mercurial <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder</hi>; which first seemed so Impossible, as that it was generaly Proclaimed to be a Sensible Instance of Vacuity; though it doth as Sensibly Disprove it by the very S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And this may further appear if you open the first Close End of the Extratorricellian Tube, for then the Included Air therin so Comprest will issue forth with a litle Poppysm, which is a manifest sig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And yet more Visibly if you carefully close the first Closed End of the Extratorricellian Tube with a litle piece of Bladder, when both the Tubes are Inverted as before the Bladder will apparently strutt, and stiffly rise up, and not be born down by the Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphere, as hath been supposed; and then the Mercurial <hi>Cylinder</hi> will not stand altogether so high as before, but proportionably low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, according to the more Space gained by the strutting of the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. And if the Torricellian Tube be Open at both Ends, and you stop one with your Finger beneath, and then it be filled with Mercury, and so you Invert it with your other hand, and place it in the <hi>Stagnum,</hi> it will notably Introsuct your Finger (which by the Inversion will then be above it) in stead of Air, becaus it is
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:61550:115"/>
next to the Mercurial <hi>Cylinder,</hi> and Weight therof; and yet it will also Introsuct Air below it to fill the Space above it; and all such Introsuctions are manifest Symptoms of Air Expanded, and not of any Vacuity, which as it can not Extrude, so neither can it Introsuct any Body, nor doth need any Body to succeed, as Plenitude doth; but those forcible Introsuctions are from that Elastical <hi>Potentia</hi> of a Body Expanded, which is to Restore itself to its own Natural Density, and other Successions of any Body against the Natural Motion therof are, as I have shewed, only to prevent Vacuity. Nor is such Introsuction any Pressure of the Atmosphere above the Finger, but most Sensibly only a Torture beneath it. Wherefore it is sufficiently evident that the Space above the Mercurial <hi>Cylinder</hi> is filled only with Expanded Air, which they who deny, do thereby shutt their Eyes against a very Curious Improvement which otherwise they might make therof by Inquiring farther how very subtily and strangely the Air doth pass into the Torricellian Tube so prepossessed with the Mercury. Which I shall now also consyder. And I can easily grant to others and my self, that it doth not nor, can it Possibly pass and Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate through the Extensive Body of the Glass or Mercury, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus itself is also an Extensive Body, and two such severaly Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensive Bodys can not be in the same Place (which, as I have said, is only Extension in Relation to the Substance of the Body itself, which thereby is in such a Position and Place as it is, (in respect of all other Bodys in the Univers) nor can there be any such Penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Extensions, or two Extensions in the same <hi>Vbi,</hi> becaus it is the Position of the Extensions, and so there can not be two Positions of one and the same Extension, though by Condensation and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refaction, Compression and Expansion the Extension itself may be Varied, the Matter being the same, as I have formerly shewed, and doth plainly appear by these and all other Instances therof. Also I conceiv that neither the Glass which is a very Imporous Body, nor the Mercury which is Fluid hath any such Pores in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self through which the Air might pass without Penetration; but that the very great Force and Violence of the Introsuction, which I have before discovered, doth make Temporary Pores, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther some pervious Passages, which are those very close and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discernible Strainers through which the Air doth pass in the Body of the Mercury itself into the Tube, and thereby is so very

And being so Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sucted by the Overweight of the Mercury, and to Prevent Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity the Weight of the Mercurial <hi>Cylinder</hi> below it is as if there were an Introsuctive <hi>Potentia</hi> above it, which might be sufficient so to Introsuct Air through it, as the Breath of a Man is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to Introsuct it through a litle Body of Water, wheras the <hi>Pondus</hi> of the Mercurial <hi>Cylinder</hi> is farr greater then the <hi>Potentia</hi> of any Mans Breath. And the Mercurial <hi>Cylinder</hi> by the Weight therof doth very hardly Introduce the Air through or between the Body therof, and may be sett in such a quiet Posture as it will not so Operate, untill it be Jogged, and begin to Fall; and when it doth Operate the Passages through the Body therof are
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:61550:116"/>
opened with great Reluctance and Commotion; as Water by the Weight therof doth so open its own Body to let out Bubbles with an Ebullition and Undulation in itself; and so the Mercurial <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder</hi> plainly discovereth a very notable Commotion by the Ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition and Undulation in the Surface and Top therof, which is to me a most plain Evidence of Air passing through it the same way, as it doth through Water; and so indeed it doth pass through Water in the Paschalian Experiment: and if any may yet conceiv a Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between Bubbles which are first forced into the Water, and so must necessarily pass out again, or Fume Introsucted by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Air Introduced by the Water or Mercury itself, and the Overweight therof, let him try and satisfy himself with the other Experiment of filling a Torricellian Tube almost full with Water or Mercury, and then stopping it with his Finger (or if he pleas Hermeticaly sealing it) suddenly Invert it, and he shall find that there will be both the same <hi>Phaenomena</hi> Proportionably of the Commotions, and the same Effect at last of the Air Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding above the <hi>Cylinder</hi> of Water or Mercury, and of that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siding beneath it: and, as I have said before, that the Space above the Mercurial <hi>Cylinder</hi> is and can be filled with nothing but the Air, so Included before in it; so in all these or in any other such Experiments, the Air passeth into the Glass as it doth out of it in the former Experiment, and though the Air be Included in the same Tube with the Mercury in the Torricellian Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet in this last mentioned Experiment, when the Tube is Inverted, it is thereby placed beneath, and without it (though the Air were before in the Tube) as well as any External Air; and must some way or other pass to Ascend above and within the Mercury, which plainly it doth by the Weight and Pressure of the Mercurial <hi>Cylinder</hi> itself; and so the Air Included in the Tube with the Mercury when the Tube is Inverted is by the Weight of the Mercury first Comprest beneath, and by litle and litle Transmitted through the Mercury into the Space above it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is Expanded above, and then again Reduced to its former Density, which fills the same Space above, as it did beneath. And though I sometimes conceived that the External Air might in the Torricellian Tube and Experiment pass between the Glass and the Mercury, (as generaly Air will, if it can, pass that way; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus those two Bodys are only Contiguous and not Continuous,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:61550:116"/>
as the Water is in itself; and so probably some Air doth so pass in the Torricellian Experiment) yet certainly it passeth also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween or through the very Body of the Mercury by those secret Passages which it so maketh, as may appear by the Commotion in the whole <hi>Cylinder,</hi> and more plainly by filling the Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torricellian Tube with Water or Oil, so as when both the Tubes are Inverted, the Water or Oil shall stand above the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricellian Tube, and every way Encompass and Drown both Tube and Mercury itself; and then let the first Closed End be opened at the Top of the Extratorricellian Tube Inverted, and the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial <hi>Cylinder</hi> will Subside to a Proportionable Standard (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting also for the Overweight of Water or Oil) as in the first Experiment, wherin only Air was left in the Extratorricellian Tube. Wherefore I apprehend it so to pass through pervious Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of the Water or Oil, and also of the Mercury, and that the Proportionable Weight of Water in the Paschalian Experiment is Equivalent to the Weight of the Mercurial <hi>Cylinder,</hi> and doth Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pand the Air Percolated through it as much: and so the Air which is so Expanded, when it is above the <hi>Cylinder</hi> by that Elastical <hi>Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> therof doth Suspend the like Weight either of Water, or Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury below it; which after they come to an <hi>Aequipotentia</hi> of the one, and <hi>Aequipondium</hi> of the other, Equaly and Mutualy Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>responding one with another there and then rest and setle in their Standard, without any more Commotions and Vibrations. And though the Mercurial Tube be never so Long, yet the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weight of the <hi>Cylinder</hi> will have the same Operation and Effect Proportionably; And so I suppose, that if the <hi>Stagnum</hi> of the Mercury were never so Deep, and the Torricellian Tube were plunged in it with the Orifice downward, and any Air left in it, or not, and then drawn upward to any Hight whatsoever, yet it shall never be raised above the Standard, nor shall the Air be ever the more Expanded, though there may be several Degrees of the Expansion therof beneath the Standard. And the Torri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellian Experiment when it is finished, is also a Weather-glass, and will Rise and Fall as well as a common <hi>Pycnometer,</hi> (but somwhat otherwise, and not so much in Measure) by Communication of the External Air with the Internal in the Torricellian Tube, as well as any other open Weather-glass; and I therefore conceiv, that the pervious Passages between the Glass and Mercury, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:61550:117"/>
also in the Body of the Mercury still stand open to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile and Imperceptible Air therin, and which doth still Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene between the Internal and External Air, whereby they so Communicate one with another; And some have observed litle No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And thus I suppose that there is the same Reason Proportionably of the Weather-glass, Pumps, <hi>Siphons,</hi> the Paschalian, and Torricel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian Experiments, and the like, from the Expansion by the Weight of Water or Mercury and Elastical <hi>Potentia</hi> of the Air itself, by Retraction and not by Pulsion, or any Pressure therof, which they do no more prove, then they did prove the preconceived Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Vacuity; and yet Men are so Fond of their own Fansys that they would perswade not only other Men, but also Nature and Experiments themselves, to be of their Opinion, and thus have very Confidently Inscribed on the Torricellian Experiment the Title of a <hi>Barometer</hi>; supposing the Atmosphere to press down the <hi>Stagnum,</hi> and so to raise the Mercurial <hi>Cylinder</hi> in the Tube to the Standard therof; wheras in the Extratorricellian Experiment after the First Closed End is opened and the Atmosphere admitted the Mercurial <hi>Cylinder</hi> doth Subside; and so certeinly the whole Pressure therof can not be so much as the <hi>Potentia</hi> of the litle Compression of Air in the Extratorricellian Tube before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Thus the Torricellian Experiment is grown famous only by certein Errors affixed to it, rather then by any Sensible Truth gained thereby, more then formerly; it being in itself, only the utmost Extent of a Weather-glass, and <hi>Epitome</hi> of a Pump.</p>

Also it doth very Sensibly appear by Wind or the Motion of Air, which Cooleth, and if it be not Vaporous, but Pure and Clear Air, though most Cold, it drieth rather then Moistneth: though, as I have said before of Heat, Drines, or Moisture, are not Congenerous with either, but Indifferent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both it and Cold, and may accompany one or other, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Circumstantial Causalytys.

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:61550:118"/>
may appear by Washing, and especialy by Laving or Waving the Hand in it, which Motion doth more Actuate the Cold of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as Winds do Actuate the Cold of Air: though as Heat in a Burning Glass doth not Instantly Burn, so Cold which is less Active, may not suddenly Cool; and being Mingled with Vapor in all the Atmosphere, the Air is thereby Tempered, and doth Cool less: and from many such Circumstantial Causalitys the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity therof may be much abated. And though it be generaly Actuated by Motion, yet it is not therefore Motion, as I have said of Heat, and therin also proved Cold not to be either Rest, or Motion formaly in itself: and though Heat generaly caus some Motion, yet Cold may be without any Sensible Motion; as in Ice, wherof the whole Body, and all the Parts therof <hi>per om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> are Consistent and Immote. And there may be a very nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Motion and Commotion, without any notable Variation of Heat or Cold, as if the Torricellian Tube be filled almost with Mercury or Water and some Air left in it, and then stop'd with your finger, and suddenly Inverted, as I before mentioned, you shall observ a very notable Commotion in the Ascent of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded Air through the Body of the Water or Mercury, almost like the Commotion that appears in the Dissolution of Metalls by <hi>Aqua fortis</hi>; and yet no notable Variation of Heat, or Cold; which plainly shews that the notable Heat in the other is not from the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but rather the Motion from the Heat, as heer it is from the Weight: and so Motion being a Common Instrument both of Bodys and Spirits, is Caused by any of them, and sometimes doth Caus them Equivocaly; but is not Univocaly in itself any other thing then Motion, as I have shewed before generaly, and shall still proceed to shew particularly in every thing which may Colorably be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected to be only Motion.

Thus Heat by Contact, or otherwise so Intens as to prevail against Cold, doth sooner overcome it then Cold Heat; as Fire Warms the Ambient Air almost Insta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ntly; but the Ambient Air doth not so suddenly Extinguish Fire in

and Physicians observ the like of Bones of <hi>Animals.</hi> Thus also Cold is a Dissolvent as well as Heat, and doth caus Vitrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Crystallisation sometimes suddenly; and I suppose might Effect more by long and Mature Generation, if it were tried; for though it is not so strong and quick a Generator as Heat, yet as a weaker Magnetical Virtue by long continuance doth Produce Magnetism in other Bodys; and Violent Tension of a Springe of Steel, if it be long continued will by Degrees over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Elastical <hi>Potentia</hi> therof, and make the very Spirit to Conform to that Figure of the Body; so there are many neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Operators in Nature, which though more weak and dull may in longer time Produce very notable Effects.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. As Aether Produceth Color, so doth Air Sound; which yet as the other seemeth to me to be no Simple, but a Mist Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And though it hath been antiently observed that Color is Mist of Light and Opacity, yet no notice hath been taken of any such Misture in Sound, which is the great Instrument of Human Speech and Discours, and yet there is none of those other Sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, whose Intrinsecal Nature is less known unto us. And I I find it very difficult farther to explain any thing therof, becaus I want even Common Terms, and words whereby to express my Conceptions. I have already proposed generaly, that as Earth hath some Proper Qualitys, as Consistence, and Magnetical Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, whereby to Fix itself; so it hath also other Connatural Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litys in itself, whereby it doth Fix the more Agile Qualitys of the other three Fluid Elements, which also require their Contrary Qualitys, wherewith to be Mist and Contemperated, as well as the fower First Qualitys. And thus we have discovered Opa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to be a Simple Quality Contrary to Light, and that by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion therof Color is Produced. And that as Light is an Aethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Quality, so Opacity is a Terrene Quality; as plainly the Earth is most Opacous, and there are no Fixed Colors without some Terreity, and the most Fixed are in such Bodys as are also Consistent. But yet I fear to seem too Curious and Novell in asserting any such Analogy in Sound; however, as I have promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, I shall adventure, and make a farther Essay therof. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the best Musical Terms that I know, shall call the two Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Contrary Qualitys, which I conceiv to be the Principles of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:61550:119"/>
Sound <hi>Acutum</hi> and <hi>Grave,</hi> or Shrill and Flatt: wherof Shrilnes is the Aereal, and more Agile Quality; and Flatnes the Terrene, and more Fixative Quality: or if we will accept of <hi>Latin</hi> Terms Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical to Light and Colors, we may call a Sound or Voice wherin Shrilnes doth Predominate, <hi>Vox Clara</hi>; and wherin Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, <hi>Vox Fusca</hi>: but as Pure Light or Pure Opacity are not Visible, so I suppose Pure Shrilnes, or Pure Flatnes, are not Audible, nor indeed that they can Actualy Exist in their own Simple Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys. And as Light is not the least Degree of Opacity, nor Opa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Light, but Different and Contrary Qualitys; so that which I intend by <hi>Acutum</hi> and <hi>Grave,</hi> and their Shrilnes and Flatnes is no Degree; as Tones or the several Not es of the <hi>Gamut,</hi> and the like, but Contrary and Different Qualitys. Yet I also observ one general Difference of Degrees between Color and Sound, that is, as all Fixed Colors have a notable Degree of Terreity, which fixeth them, and Desultory Colors less; so Sound, which is only Desultory and Momentaneous Individualy, as I have said, requires a less share of Terreity then Desultory Color, though it be commonly Produced by Collision of Terrene Bodys Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naly. And as Fire Produced by Collision Originaly may fire a whole Train of Gunpowder Successively, so doth the Original Collision Produce Sound, that is afterward Continued by its own Spiritual Quality, which is alway Potentialy in all the Air, and Actuated by such Collision of the Air, which hath also, as I have said, some Earth in the Mistion therof, as well as the other Elements (and as we may see Terreous Motes and Corpuscles to float therin). And it is so Produced Instrumentaly and Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caly by Motion, or rather Commotion; for as the Original In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument therof is Collision, so the Immediate Caus of any Sound is the <hi>Tremor,</hi> which is only caused by Commotion. Wherefore Aether and Planets though most Swift Movers, yet becaus they Move in Fluid Ambient Bodys most Equaly, and thereby make no Commotion therof, therefore also they make no Sound, or Nois, or Pythagorean Musike: yea Aqueous or Terreous Bodys so Moving in Air, make litle or no Sound; as a <hi>Stella Cadens,</hi> Snow, Rain, Hail, in the fall before they come to the Earth: so a Round and Smooth Bullet, that is not hollow, shott from a Gun makes no Proportionable Nois, becaus by the swift Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on therof it preventeth the Resistance of the Air, as I have
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:61550:120"/>
said, and so maketh litle or no Commotion therin; wheras a Rod, or Whip, by a Smart Percussion of the Air Resisting it, and thereby suffering a Commotion, maketh a notable Sound; and especialy Thunder, which suddenly breaking out of the Cloudy Meteor teareth it asunder, every way, and dasheth it upon the Air, and by sudden Expansion of the Inflamed Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning maketh such a Terrible Report (like the Flame of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder out of a Gun) and so fluid Bodys by mutual Resistance, and by the sudden Impuls that will not suffer them to Mingle peaceably, make a Violent Commotion, and Produce Sound; as Water suddenly dashed against Water; wheras in a gentle Flux and Mixture it makes litle or no Commotion, or Sound. But to Continue the Sound, there must be a Continued <hi>Tremor</hi> in the Solid Body, as Bells, Strings, and the like: and where there is no such <hi>Tremor</hi> Originaly by Commotion, there is no Sound, as I have said; as in Collition of Wooll; and if it be not Continued the Sound ceaseth; as by stopping a Bell. But any <hi>Tremor</hi> of a Body in the outward <hi>Superficies</hi> therof, may so caus the Sound to be heard without the Body; as is reported of the <hi>Aetites,</hi> and of a Bell of Gold being Closed round with a Stone, or Clapper, within it; and so Commotion under Water, which makes a <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor</hi> also in the <hi>Superficies</hi> therof, may caus a Sound to be heard in the Air; though also Water and Ice, Glass, and the like Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raqueous <hi>Composita</hi> have much Air, as well as Earth, in their Mistions and so may be Proportionably capable of Sound, which is Mist of the two Simple Qualitys, Proper to Air, and Earth. And though this <hi>Tremor</hi> is the most Notable and Immediate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of Sound, yet the Multiplication of the Sound in the Air is, as I have said, only of the Spiritual Quality itself so first Actuated thereby without any more Commotion. And indeed Sound doth not caus any such Undulation or Waveing therof up and down, like Circles in a Pond, as hath been supposed. Much less is Sound or Voice, though Articulate, any figuration of the Air, or Carving therof into Characters, like written Letters; for then we could not hear two several Sounds together, as we may if they be very Dissonant; as of a Voice and of a Musical Instrument; or any one Sound of one of the Voices in Consort by attending more to it then to others: and certeinly several Auditors may so attend to, and hear several Voices: for the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:61550:120"/>
Figure of the one Intersecting the other would thereby Disfigure and Deface one another. Nor could an <hi>Echo</hi> then return any Articulate Voice, when the Figured Air is dashed against a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave Bank or Wall, unless the Bank or Wall had also such Orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Parts, whereby to Figurate it again, and so Return it: but only the Air as I have said, having the sound Actuated in it, and being Reverberated, doth Return it with the Sound in it; which is by a Stop therof, as it may also be Diverted by Wind. And in an <hi>Echo</hi> we only Hear the last Word Because it is last, for the precedent Words by that Stop being overtaken by the following are somwhat drowned, as the last is not. Nor do great Winds or Wafts of the Air caus Proportionable Sounds, unles they Collide the Air against Trees or Houses, or the like, whereby they caus such a <hi>Tremor</hi> in it; wheras the Motion or Undulation of the Air in itself, causeth neither <hi>Tremor,</hi> nor Sound. And the Sound or Voice is Continualy Propagated in the Air by the first Sound or Voice Actuated in it: and so doth pass away continualy; and as it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> said, <hi>Nescit Vox missa reverti</hi>; nor can the same Voice (otherwise then by an <hi>Echo</hi>) be heard twice by one man, unles he could fly away Faster then it, and hear it again, as another man doth at a farther Distance, which is Impossible: for it is very swift, though not like Emanant Light of Lightning, which is seen before we hear the Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clap, and if we estimate the distance of the Thunder cloud and different Space of Time, between the first Sight of the Flash, and Hearing of the Clap, we may partly judg of their different Velocitys. Also Sound is very Longinquous, though not so farr as Light Emanant: Broad sides in a late Naval Batell have been heard an hundred Miles from the Place. Nor is Sound Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, but always Inherent, though never Immanent, but Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sient, and therefore hath no Refraction, nor Reflection of itself; but as the Air (in which it is Inherent) is only Moved by the Wind, which yet doth not wholy Divert it; becaus it is so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly Propagated in the Air, and Penetrateth and passeth away more swiftly, then the Body of the Air can Move in itself by any Corporeal Motion: and it is Reflected in an <hi>Echo</hi> only by the Reverberation of the Air itself; otherwise it terminateth and abateth itself by less and less Degrees. And yet while it continues, it is not Spent, or Exhausted by Hearing, as Odors,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:61550:121"/>
and Sapors, which are more Gross, and more Immersed in the Vapors, and Liquors, therof; but a whole Army of Soldiers may all Hear the Oration of their General: which also plainly sheweth it not to be any Figurative, or Corporeal thing, but a most wonderfull Spiritual Quality; which successively and by Innumerable Propagated Individualitys so conveys itself to the very Organ of Hearing, yet not corporealy striking upon the <hi>Tympanum</hi> therof; as Anatomists generaly suppose, and so also call some Internal Parts of the Ear by such Significant Names, <hi>Incus</hi> and <hi>Malleus</hi>; for plainly in Hearing we do not Perceiv any the least Commotion or <hi>Tremor,</hi> but only the Spiritual Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity itself, which is the Proper Sensible and Object of the Sens; and if we feel any Commotion, as in discharging a Gun neer to the Ear, that is only the Waft of Air which the Ear feels, as any other Part of the Body also may by the Sens of Feeling, but doth Hear only the Vehement Sensible of Sound by the Sens of Hearing. Nor yet are there any Rays of Sound as of Light, so to convey unto the Sense the Image therof, and so several Images to several mens Senses; but only the same Spiritual Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is so propagated <hi>per omnia</hi>; which is very Admirable and Curious, and deserving more Notice and Consyderation then Philosophy hath hitherto bestowed upon it. Also several Sounds do Penetrate one another <hi>per omnia,</hi> so as to Convey the whole Sound in every Point of the Air, and to every Ear within the Sphere therof, and not Confound any of them so being Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in the Air, which yet is not only Directed by the Breath of the Speaker, and the like, but also Diverted by Winds, and Reflected by <hi>Echo's</hi>: and several Sounds seem somwhat to hinder and Interrupt one another, if that be not rather an Infirmity of the Sens, then any Confusion of the Sensible Qualitys, as the Ey can not so distinctly See several Visibles, though certeinly the Images therof do not Confound one another. And as Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Magnitude, or Ampliation by Multiplication of several Parts into one Total, doth, as I have observed, Augment the whole beyond the Proportions of the Particulars; so many Sounds together are Heard farther then any one of them Singly; as a whole Broadside, or Cry of Hounds; like a great Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, which is farther Visible in the Whole then any Part alone could be Seen. And Sound reflected at a great Distance is heard
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:61550:121"/>
better then Directly, but best neer to the Reflection (like Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected Rays of Heat or Light) becaus though the Reflection doth not make any new figuration of the Sound or Voice, yet it doth Return and Reduplicate it so Generating itself Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively in the Air, as I have shewed. But the greatest Mystery and <hi>Incognitum</hi> is, how the Air which plainly is not Configu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated or Effigiated by Sound or Voice, but only putt into such or such a <hi>Tremor</hi> by the first Collision therof, whereby the Sound or Voice is first Actuated and Specificated Equivocaly, should afterward Univocaly Generate it in itself Successively without any more Collision Commotion or <hi>Tremor</hi> in itself. For there seemeth to be none such afterward in the Air; as you may try by a Flame of a Candle or the least Feather hung by a Thread in an upper Chamber, and let the greatest Sound, or Noise, be made under the Chamber window in the open Air, so as the Chamber be not shaken, nor the Waft of Air come toward it, but go the other way from it; which, as I have said, doth not at all concern the Sound: and then observe whether there be any Motion or <hi>Tremor</hi> in the Flame or Feather, more then would be without any such Sound or Nois: certeinly it will not be in any maner Proportionable to the greatnes of the Sound or Nois, as it should be if it were the very Sound or Nois. But I shall not Penetrate any farther into this very Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Secret of Nature, nor Pronounce what Sound is Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly; only Affirming it generaly to be a Spiritual Quality, and not any Corporeal Motion, though it be alway first Equivocaly Generated by Motion, which is therefore so Concom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yet we must carefully Distinguish, as I have said, between the very Essence and Formality of any thing, and any most necessary Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentality therof whatsoever; otherwise we should know no Difference between our own Bodys and Spirits in this Conjunct State therof. And whosoever will not so Distinguish between the Spiritual Quality of Sound (which is a Proper Sensible and the first Collision Motion and <hi>Tremor</hi> which is only the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal Generator therof, though alway necessarily requisite as an Instrument, and yet, in itself hardly so much as a Common Sensible, nor Perceptible in and with the Sound by the same

Nor can I conceive that all these Unnecessary and Deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Meteors, which now appear in the Air, were so in it when it was first made, or before the Fall of Man; for whose sake, not only Earth, but all the Elements were Accursed; and that Curs hath produced many Sensitive <hi>Anomala</hi>; and not only Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars and Thorns, but also Inundations, Meteors, Comets, and all the Imperfections Monsters and <hi>Anomala</hi> of Nature, which was first made Perfect and truly Natural: and we only read of Vapors then in the Air which are the Natural <hi>Effluvia</hi> of Water, (as Rays are the Emanations of Aether) and most wonderfull <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:61550:122"/>
the Earth,</hi> which was Watered only with Vapors and that, <hi>There went up a Mist from the Earth, and Watered the whole face of the Ground</hi>; and so also supplied the Fountains Springs and Rivers of Fresh Water. Wherefore, as I have before Ingaged, I shall now plainly prove Vapor to be only Water Rarefied, and not Air. It is expressly so termed in the Text, Waters above, in respect of the other Elementary Water or <hi>Waters beneath.</hi> And it is Demonstrable that it is so, becaus it hath all the Propertys of Water, and none of Air, except only the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal and Common Affection of Rarity; but as Air if it be never so much Rarefied or Expanded, yet doth not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ceas to be Air, so neither Water Rarefied into Vapor, to be Water. Also it is not, as I have said, so Cold as Air, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tepid; nor so Diaphanous, but Refracts more; nor so Sonorous, for any Voice is better and farther heard in Sude and Serene Weather, then in Mists and Foggs; and it is confessed by all that it Moistens more then Air, which is the true Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Water. And we have most Sensible Experiment int he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Return therof into Water, as well as the Efflux therof from Water, which is only by Condensation and Rarefaction, and no Transpeciation. Certeinly we may as well affirm Ice to be Earth, as Vapor Air. Nor are all those Bubbles which appear in Expansion of Fluid Bodys always Air, as is supposed, but commonly Vapor; and therefore have a greater aptitude to be Imbibed by Dry Bodys, and to Insinuate themselves into them more then into Pores, into which Air doth more readily enter; and they stick longer to Glass, Stone, Metalls, and the like, then Air; and Moisten more; with many such Symptoms, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may be Discerned, being in themselves of very Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Natures. And we must also Distinguish between Vapors themselves, which are either Produced by the more gentle and Calefactive Power of Heat, and were, as I have said, so made in this Second Day, and readily Return again into Water; as in Rain, or any Distillation, and still continue Actualy Moist; and these Vapors are also more Fluid, and only Conglomerate toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with litle Consistence in more Dark Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ts and Foggs in the Air, such as we see to rise from Rivers and Vallys in a Morning, or Evening; yet they are not Common Elementary Water or Waters beneath, but Waters above; which therefore
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:61550:123"/>
are so easily Trasmuted, Neither are Clouds any Cisterns, Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, or Sponges, conteining Rain; for indeed Rain-water is such a Ponderous Body as could not Possibly be Suspended in the Air, but would fall down in Cataracts, and destroy the <hi>Terricolae</hi>; wheras these Vapors being suddenly Rarefied by Heat, and as suddenly Condensated again by Cold, or Comprest by Wind, do accordingly Descend leasurely in greater or less Drops, and the main Body therof is in the mean time carried about to Water a greater Space of Ground; and so Dews, which are Vapors not drawn up so forcibly, nor so high, (commonly by the Nocturnal <hi>Tepor,</hi>) soon fall down again upon Trees and Herbs, and are there collected and hang in Drops. And if the Air be very Cold, whereby these Moist Vapors are Congela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, then accordingly they either fall in Hail (as Icicles, and <hi>Stiriae</hi> in some Cold Caverns of the Earth) and by their very Stillicidation and Agitation are formed into such Corpuscular Figures, which could not be, if they had ever been one Intire Body of Ice in the Air. And if the Cold be not so Intens, and the Vapors much Agitated before and in their Congelation, then they are turned into Snow, which is only frozen Spume, and being a Lighter Body is therefore longer Suspended in the Air, and there Congeled in whole Lumps as appears plainly in the Alps, but falling lower in our lower Regions breaks into Flakes. And Dews which do not Ascend higher are turned into Frosts. Or there is another kind of Vapor Produced by the more Violent and Caustike Power of Heat, and which is Burnt and Adust thereby, and therefore we call it, Fume, or Smoak; which is more Desiccated and Consistent, and hath such Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene Qualitys, wherwith Water is Mist, Actuated in it; and so will continue longer, and is rather Actualy Dry then Moist. And there are some such Dry Mists lower in Summer; and they portend Dry Weather commonly; And of these Fumes are the Bright Clouds (which indeed are more Properly Clouds, and have a particular Name in Hebrew) Composed; and they are usualy higher in the Air then the others, being so raised by the greater Heat, and so the Sky is also Exprest by their Name. And more moist Thunderclouds which are of the other kind and usualy Resolved into Rain are lower then these Bright Clouds, and many times go one way while the others go another way.
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:61550:123"/>
But I suppose that these Bright Clouds (which are therefore so called becaus they do more Equaly Reflect the Sun beams like a Molten <hi>Speculum</hi> as hath been said) commonly are not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved into Rain, and therefore are termed <hi>Clouds without Water,</hi> but that according to the Hebraical Etymology by farther Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction and Condensation or Compression and the Agitation of the Air they are at length broken and Comminuted into those litle Bodys or Pulviscles which we call Motes, and are Visibly seen in Sun beams, and continue so in the Air floating up and down longer then any dust of the Earth (or, as the Poet calleth it, Cloud of Dust) which almost as suddenly falleth as it riseth; Wheras these being more Fuliginous and Light do wander up and down much longer; though at length they also Descend and Subside on the Earth, otherwise they should clogg and choak the Atmosphere; which yet is usualy replenished with them, and we drink them in continualy as Horses do Mudd the Water to thicken it; And so Fishes Introsuct Air, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily doth Temper their more Dens Drink and make it more Thin, and which they suck in and through the Water, as I have shewed in the Torricellian Experiment, and when they would suck it in more freely come toward the Top of the Water, whereby the Air in the Introsuction therof passeth through a less Strainer, and they cannot long Live without some Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suction of Air; as appears in Ponds frozen, wherin we use to break Holes in the Ice for that purpose; and accordingly the Fishes come to them, even to the very Top of the Water, to Refresh themselves with the fresh Air, which they there Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suct, and are so greedy of it, or sick for want of it, that they are easily taken: though also several sorts of Fishes require se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraly more Rare or more Dens Drink, as River fish will be stifled with Mudding the Water, and Seafish grow faint in fresh Water, and the like. And indeed our Atmosphere is not nor may not be pure Air, as is found by them who have been in the Tops of the <hi>Andes,</hi> and by the Experiments of Birds and Beasts in the Airpump or <hi>expansor,</hi> which are almost Exanima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereby; and also by the Tension and Elastici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="234" facs="tcp:61550:124"/>
more Inspired then Respired, which is the Atmospherical Drink, and perhaps some kind of Aliment of the Spirits, but very much Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por is Excreted by Perspiration. And there is very great Difference of the Atmosphere in several Habitations, Higher, or Lower; as may appear by the <hi>Pycnometer.</hi> But I conceive generaly that such a Temper of the Atmosphere, as was in the first <hi>Expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum,</hi> is most desirable and healthfull; which, whatsoever it might be otherwise, was rather Mingled with Vapor or Waters above then with Fume; And it is requisite in an Healthfull Air also that Excrementitious Vapors as well as Fumes, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinualy Ascend into the Air, be Purged and Dispersed continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aly by Wind, or some Agitation of Open Air, and therefore Close Rooms are very Offensive, and almost Stifle the Breath, especialy if they be Vaporous as newly Plasterd, or With a Charcoal Fire in them, which strangely Alters the Air by a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and vehement Rarefaction; And because the Water doth most evaporate, therefore there is a chief Consyderation to be had therof, whether it be Pure, or Moorish or Brackish; for Salt also will be Volatilised, as I have said; and because the Earth doth also Evaporate, and not only the Vapors therin, but Rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Corpuscles of Earth do also Ascend with the Vapors, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syderation is to be had therof; as whether it be Sandy or Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky, which Emitt least or best Corpuscles, or Fenny or Slimy, which are worst. So that in the Situation of Houses there is also regard to be had of the Soil, and of the Atmosphere, which is an Aliment, or at least a great and continual Instrument of Life, and must be Consydered as some part of Houskeeping. The Wind which Purifys the Atmosphere is rightly termed <hi>Aer Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> (as the same <hi>Hebrew</hi> word signifys both) and I easily grant it to be no special Quality in itself, but only Motion and Agitation of the Air which is a very Fluid and Mobile Body, and is Moved Variously by the Vapors Variously Ascending into it, and other Meteors in it, and such Circumstantial Causalitys, more or less Condensating or Rarefying it, and which render the Weather-cock as Unstable as the Weather-glass. And where the Motion begins, it drives forward the Parts of the Mobile Body of the Air one upon another; and where they find any Vent or Passage, they being in Motion flow thither, like Water; whereby in some places there are more Constant <hi>Etesiae,</hi> and Tradewinds, as they

call them, like <hi>Vento's</hi> or Ventiducts made by Art; and this was one of <hi>Columbus</hi> his Arguments that there was more Earth. And as the Winds are thus caused by Vapors, so the Southern parts of the World being more Watery, are therefore, as I have said, more Tepid or Warm, and Rainy or Misty; and the Northern parts being more Terreous, and Emitting more of the Terreitys, therefore the Northwind is contrarily more Cold and Dry. And the Sun in the Diurnal Motion of the Aether being carried from East to West, and so better Concocting the Vapors which he hath before raised and passed over in such his Diurnal Cours, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore generaly Eastern Winds are also more Cold and Dry, and Western Warmer and Moister; and some Winds are observed to Rise and Fall with the Rising and Setting of the Sun. But if any Wind or Weather be so Copious and Durable as to be carried about the whole Terraqueous Globe, then the same Wind may be of a Contrary Temper from the same Caus; and so many times Rains come from the North and East; and commonly they are very great, becaus they are so Copious and Durable; and so in <hi>Africa,</hi> and other hot Climes, there are Infrequent Rains, but when they happen they are Excessive, becaus the Sun doth very Copiously rais Vapors, and if it happen by any Circumstantial Causality that he can not Concremate and Desiccate them as much, they all turn into Rain. And so the Hot Meteor of a Thunder-cloud draws very Copious and Dark Vapors, which, when the Heat breaks forth in Lightning, are presently Resolved into Rain: though otherwise, when there are few other such Vapors in the Air neer to it, there are also dry Lightnings without any great Nois; becaus they are not Exploded out of such Clouds as the others: and Thunder-clouds may go against the Wind, as we say; becaus they are Moved and Impelled by their own Heat, and by their great Commotion after the Explosion of the Lightning they commonly turn the Wind. And Concurrent Causes may Move and Impell the Mobile Air every way, and when it cannot Move fast enough Progressively, then, as I have said, it must Move Circularly; whereby it becomes a <hi>Turbo</hi> or Whirlwind, which I conceive rather to be such, then all the Winds blowing against one another. <hi>Ignes fatui</hi> are Inflamed Exhalations, more Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid, and less Fiery, having some Fatt and Viscous Corpuscles of Earth in their Misture; and arise generaly from such Soils.

All which Violent and Excessive Meteors are, as I have said, general Effects of the Divine Curs; and so Thunder is called the Voice of God; and ought to be regarded: but I do not apprehend these general Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects to be any such special Prodigys and Portents, as some would have them to be. The <hi>Iris,</hi> and the like, are Properly no Meteors, but only Reflections of the Sun-beams from a Vaporous Cloud like a Prism, being also more Opacous then the Bright Clouds. And I doubt not but that there were Rainbows before the Deluge, (though not before the Fall) as well as Lambs before the Pass-over, Water and Bread and Wine before Baptism and the Lords Supper: for all such Sacramental Elements are in themselvs Natural, and only su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturaly Instituted to be Symbolical Signes; and so was the Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, which signifys Sunshine after Rain, and doth very fitly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the Covenant that God made with <hi>Noah</hi>; that as he and his Family were then saved from the Deluge, so it should never after come upon his Posterity: and as God said, <hi>I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting Covenant between God and every Living Creature of all flesh that is upon the Earth,</hi> so should we, when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold this his Bow in the Clouds, thankfully remember his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Deliverance; both that which is past, wherin we all who were then in the loins of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Sons were preserved, and also future; concerning which God hath given us such an everlasting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and this Signe therof.</p>

               <p>God having before caused part of the Water to ascend in Vapors into the Air, did afterward caus the rest to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, and be derived into certein Canales in the Earth, which he had also prepared for it: and so made the Surface of the Earth, which before was covered with

And this Ordination of all these three Elements was their Goodness and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And when God had thus prepared all the fower Elements, he caused the Earth, being pregnant with Vegetative Principles, accordingly to bring forth Grass, Herbs, and Trees, above the Surface therof, after their several Kinds: and the Herbs and Trees had also their several Seeds and Seminal Virtues in themselves, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to Propagate and Multiply afterward.

But how farr the Waters are beneath the Levell or <hi>Campus</hi> of the Earth is not particularly expressed; yet we read of a great Deep or Ocean, and of Fountains therof or
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:61550:127"/>
therin; (as we so say <hi>Fons. Blundusii,</hi> and the like) not that there is, besides the Ocean, any Fountain therof beneath it, which feeds and supplys it; for it is called the Deep, becaus it is the deepest of all Waters: and so Fountains and Depths of Waters are used indifferently, as it is said, <hi>A Land of Brooks of Water, of Fountains, and Depths, that spring out of Vallys and Hills</hi>: and both are said to be under the Earth; wherefore becaus Rain and Waters in those dry Countrys were accounted great Blessings, <hi>Iacob</hi> blesseth <hi>Ioseph</hi> with <hi>Blessings of Heaven above, and Blessings of the deep that lieth under,</hi> which <hi>Moses</hi> also repeateth: nor is it said that there is a Deep, and also Fountains therof, beneath, and besides it, but they are alway termed the Fountains of the Deep, not only in respect of itself, but also of all Vapors, Rain and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, wherof the Deep or Sea is the Fountain; to which that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression seems to refer, for so they are joined together, as it is said, that there were <hi>the Fountains of the Great Deep broken up, and the Windows of Heaven were opened</hi>: and indeed they are so made to be Fountains one unto another mutualy and reciprocaly, as I shall shew heerafter: and in the Deluge, the Conflux of all the Waters was gathered together, to cover the whole Earth, not as it did at first equaly cover the whole Surface therof, but the Canales, <hi>Campus,</hi> and highest Hills, as they then stood and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued: <hi>fifteen Cubits did the Waters prevail, and the Mountains were covered.</hi> Whereby we may partly estimate the quantity of the whole Body of Waters, which yet may be Rarefied or Condensated more or less: nor can we exactly tell what is the Proportion of the Surface of the Waters to the Surface of Dry Land in the whole Terraqueous Globe.

And I shall heer observ, that as Vapors, or Waters above, were so made by special Creation in the Second Day, so they are of speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Use and Consideration, being a very Subtile and Spirituous <hi>Effluvium,</hi> and a notable Instrument of Nature, and also a <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struum</hi> carrying forth with it not only part of the Body, but also much of the Spirit: and this is indeed that which Chymists com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call, Spirit, as it so carrieth forth the Spiritual Qualitys with itself; being a very fitt Vehicle therof: whence some have fansied a Conversion and Transpeciation in itself, which I have already refuted: but certeinly it causeth a very great Alteration of the Bodys out of which it is emitted, and Translation of the Spirits therof; being not so Dens or Consistent as Earth, nor as Water out of which it is produced; and almost as Rare as Air and Aether: and so Intercedeth and Mediateth between all the Elements, and doth Evoke the Spirits therof; as is commonly observed of the firmest Timber, that if it be often Wett and Dry again, it soon Rotts; which also takes away the State of Hay, as Husbandmen say, in their Chymical expression therof. Yea, I suppose, that what is intended by the famous Chymical Term of Fermentation is only the Operation of a Hott Spirit on a Moist, Intrinsecaly within the Body therof, by Vaporation; which plainly discovers itself accordingly by some Turgescence and Ebullition; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Benigne and Homogeneous Spirits are better Concocted and more equaly Distributed, which doth exceedingly Meliorate and Maturate; and the more Maligne and Heterogeneous do Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate, or otherwise the Spirits being in agitation, by any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate Excess, or Defect, become more Corrupt and Putrid. Thus Heat and Moisture Operating and Fermenting within Bodys produce all Elementary Generation and Corruption, and are thereby also very subservient to Vegetation, and Vivification. Now as I said before of Air, so the very Spirit of Water is unknown to us, nor have we any apt <hi>Vocabulum</hi> therof; or if we had, yet we could not thereby know the Substantial Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit itself, or the Nature therof; but only by those Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:61550:128"/>
or Spiritual Qualitys, wherof I shall now proceed to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scours.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The first or principal Quality of Water is Moisture, as I have already proved: and indeed, unless Water be Moist, I neither know what is Water, nor what is Moisture. And I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that Elementary Water is most Moist, that is, it doth Moisten most strongly, though Vapor, being more Rare and Subtile, may sooner penetrate; as Fixed Fire doth certeinly Heat most, though Volatile Flame doth most penetrate: and yet when Vapor hath thus penetrated, it doth most Moisten by being Condensated again into Water: but Vapor may be also Adusted and turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Smoak, which is Actualy Dry, as I have shewed, and that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be supposed of Water Immediately, untill it be first turned into Vapor. And Oil seemeth to Moisten more then Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Water, becaus it is more Unctuous, and Evaporateth less, whereby it reteins the Moisture longer; as a boiling pot of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being covered, doth retein the Vapor and Moisture more then uncovered, and therefore that Water is longer in boiling away, and so is Oil then Water; thus though pure Water doth, as I said, Moisten most, becaus Moisture is the Proper Quality ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and all others Moisten only by participation of Water; yet it doth also Evaporate most, whereby it becomes Vapor and Water above, which is also another Proper Quality therof, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by drys away soonest. Also though it moisten most, yet in Wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it may be advantaged by other Bodys; as pure Water doth not Rens or Scowr so well, as if it be mingled with Earthy particles of Chalk, Marl, Bran, or the like, which render it more Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stersive, and make it, as Huswives say, bear Soap better; becaus those Terreous Corpuscles do Imbibe Unctuous Bodys better then Water, and thereby reconcile them together, yet not without heating, beating, laving, or the like: and so Water and Milk mingle together, the Oleous parts of the <hi>Butyrum</hi> being reconciled to the Water by the <hi>Serum</hi>; wheras Butter itself, Oil, Turpentine, Mercury, and the like, will not so easily mingle with Water; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus they are not so Aqueous; which appears by their less Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration: nor will Water easily mingle with Vapor, while they continue such; because God hath so vastly differenced them in their Creation, that they shall be either Waters beneath, or Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:61550:129"/>
above; whose different Density is as a Thousand to One, and they can hardly continue in any of those thousand Degrees between them, though they pass from one to the other by them all; as may appear by the Motion of Water boiling in a pott, which first is scarcely seen to Move, and then Simpers, as they say, and so boils up more and more, though they will continue in some Degrees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that proportion, as Meteors in any Region of the Air. And Evaporation is such a notable Property of Water, and Symptom of the Aqueous Nature, that I suppose all Elementary Water, if it be not frozen with Cold, will Evaporate always with any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Heat, or <hi>Tep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And, I suppose, the Experiment of the Capillar Tube to be from this Cohesion and the Homogeneity of Water, and another Conjunct Reason (which I shall assigne afterward) for I know no such Spiritual Homogeneity between Water and Glass, which is rather Terreous (though Poets call Water Vitreous) but as I have shewed the whole Body of Matter is Homogeneous in itself, and Continuous with itself, though Spirits may be Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous, and by their Heterogeneity Discontinue their Bodys of Matter; therefore, as when by reason of their Consistence, or otherwise, they cannot perfectly close together, other Bodys do and must Intervene, to prevent Vacuity; so when themselvs can so close, they also in like maner prevent it themselvs, and so need no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

or Heterogeneous; becaus they are all Bodys of Matter, whatsoever their Spirits may be: and so polished Metalls will Cohere to Marble, aswell as Metall to Metall, or Marble to Marble: and thus Water being Naturaly as Smooth, and of as equal a Surface, as any Glass can be made Artificialy, and being Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous to the Capillar Glass, doth notably Cohere, as it will to any Smooth Glass, so that it can very hardly be shaken off by swinging, or the like; though it will more easily slide by its own Weight or <hi>Pondus,</hi> as polished Marbles will one from another be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moved by any <hi>Potentia,</hi> whereby Air may succeed at the Edges therof; though otherwise they will not be pulled one from another Parpendicularly with less Power then if they were so farr Imperfectly Continuous: and so according to the proportionable Weight of the Water in the Capillar Tube, it doth descend and depart from its Contiguity. And thus the Inside of the Tube of Glass, (which is therefore Capillar, becaus the Cavity therof is not much bigger then an Hair) being Madefied, either by other Water, or by the Vapor of that Water wherin it stands (which as I have said doth always Evaporate, if it be not obstructed) Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Glass by Degrees, though very slowly, and in much longer time, and the Glass being either way Madefied with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Inside therof, which, as I said, sticks so closely to the Consistent Body therof, and reaching down to the Water wherin it stands, and which is Homogeneous with it, both the Waters do mingle, and would flow together, as all Aqueous Bodys Naturaly do; and becaus the Water in which it stands being Stagnant, and having no Actual Weight, cannot draw the other down to itself being so strongly Coherent to the Inside of the Glass, as I have shewed that upper Water according to the strength of the Cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion draws up th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he Weight of the Water so drawn up doth oversway it; and accordingly it lifts up and keeps suspended a proportionable <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder</hi> of Water, higher, or lower, as the Cavity of the Tube is less, or greater; and becaus that <hi>Cylinder</hi> of Water is supported, as I said, by the Cohesion to the Sides of the Tube, which is therefore strongest at the Sides, the Water so supported is there highest, and so less, and less, and lowest in the midst; whereby the Surface of the <hi>Cylinder</hi> becomes Concave: wheras Mercury will not so ascend by reason of its over-weight, which, as I have said,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:61550:130"/>
doth prevail against any such Cohesion with Glass; and therefore also if the Capillar Tube be sett in it, the Surface within the Orifice therof will not be Concave, but Convex; becaus by the Orifice of the Tube, the Mercury, which is a farr more Consistent Body then Water, is deprest most at the Sides, and so thereby less, and less, and therefore is highest in the midst. Also Water hath some Consistence in it from the Terreity, that is in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion therof; and this is the other Concurrent Reason which I before intimated; for if it were wholy Consistent, as Earth; or Fluid, as Aether, the Experiment would not Succeed; but by the partial Consistence therof, it doth also somwhat Rope, as we say, or hang together, and so by the Homogeneity of the Water in the Tube, and that wherin it stands, meeting and mingling together, and being apt to flow together one way or other, the Water in the Tube, having the advantage of Cohesion, and Prevalence therof above the Weight of the Water in which it stands, doth so farr draw it up, untill they both become Equipollent, and then there they stand. And thus if you fill a Glass Cruet almost to the top with Water, and then incline it toward the Nose therof, so as the Water may run farther into it then when it stood erected Perpendicularly, and then very gently revers it, and erect it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain Perpendicularly as before; the Water will stand in the Nose proportionably above the Levell therof in the Neck of the Cruet, as it will in the Capillar Tube; and both are from the same Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current Reasons, which I have declared. Nor do we discover the Symptoms of any other Motions of the Water afterward, or any farther advantage gained by such Elevation therof, neither will it so run in a <hi>Siphon</hi> higher, or more swiftly, then it would do otherwise. And though the Subsilience of the Water in the Capillar Tube be very quick, and <hi>per Saltum,</hi> (as generaly such Motions are) yet it is not very strong, as you may perceiv, if you stop the upper Orifice of the Tube with your Finger, which will hinder the Ascent therof, becaus it hath not sufficient strength to Compress the Included Air. But this Experiment plainly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers the Continuity of Matter, and Spiritual Appetite of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is between Homogeneous Natures, especialy Elementary, being next to Matter, which can never be Disunited from itself, as Material Spirits and their Bodys may be; which yet being Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aly United, will flow together, if they may, and cannot be so

easily Divelled, as Heterogeneous. And it shews that there is some Earthy Consistence, even in Water; which appears also in Bubbles, that are as Skins of Water including Air; and as the Heterogeneous Air doth Conglobate within, which makes the Bubble Spherical, so it doth thereby resist the Air without. Also not only thicker Liquors, but even standing Water hath some such Skin upon it; so that a Needle very gently laid upon it will not sink so fast at first, as when it hath broken through that Skin: And so we see such Cobwebs on the ground, as Husbandmen call them; but this Terreity most notably appears in Vapor Adust, or Fume, which turns into a Soot in Chimnys not only as Motes, but in larger Pulviscles; and so in Conglaciation of Ice, which discover plainly a Misture of Drines and Consistence, that are Earthy Qualitys, with the Moisture of Water: Also we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv how in Filtratio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">III. Though I suppose there may be several other Simple Qualitys both of Air, and Water, besides the First, as they are called, that is, Cold of Air, and Moisture of Water, as well as Light and others, besides Heat, in Aether; and Consistence and others, besides Drines, in Earth; yet becaus they are not so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, I shall not now hunt after them farther then I meet with them in such Sensibles, wherin I conceiv Water and some Simple Quality therof to be Predominant, as I have before observed of Color, and Sound. Now these Aqueous Sensibles are Odors, and Sapors; and as God divided the Waters into Water beneath, and above, or Gross Water, and Subtile Vapor; so these two se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Sensibles are severaly Inherent in them, that is, Odor in the Vapor and <hi>Effluvium,</hi> and Sapor in the Grosser Water. And yet Odor is more Gross then Sound, as Sound is then Color, and neither Transient as Sound, nor Emanant as Color, but more Fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Inherent in the Odorous <hi>Effluvium</hi>; and is accordingly varied and carried away with it: and as the Vapor is more Dens, or Rare, so generaly is the Odor more Gross, or Fine: and as the Vapor, so the Odor, is more Dens and Gross, as it is more neer
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:61550:131"/>
to the Aqueous Body; and more Rare and Fine as it is farther Effluent from it, and more Dispersed thereby: and yet there is a very longinquous Efflux and Waft of Odors in such diffusion of Vapors; as is sensibly perceived by the Sent of Heaths of Rosemary very far at Sea, and by the Convolation of Ravens and Vulturs to Carcasses very farr distant. Also as Odors are of an Aqueous nature, so there is a very quick and permanent Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion therof to Moist Bodys; for so the Sent of an Hares or Deers Foot continues long on the Moist ground in every <hi>Vestigium</hi> therof, though they run very swiftly over it; which could not be so deteined without the Subtile Vapor, in which it is Inherent, and which sticketh to the ground; and is not so easily discharged as a Cloud of Breath from a D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s Spices, and the like; becaus such Vapors are also more strong, and there is a Terreous Quality, as well as Aqueous, wherof Odor is Compounded, as I shall afterward shew: but commonly the Odorous Evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is more Actuated and produced by Moisture; as Flowers and Herbs after Rain smell more sweetly: and Dry or Unctuous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes, by Infrication of the Powder, or Imbibition of the Oil or Butter, are more strong and durable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becaus thereby there is an Incorporation of the very Odorous Bodys, which are the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the Odors, as I said: and generaly all Dissolutions, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Maceration Externaly, or Putrefaction Internaly, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Vapors are more freely Emitted, and the Odors Actuated, do caus greater Sents: also long restraint of the Actual Vapors and Odors, as in close Vessels, or Rooms, when they are first opened cause stronger Smells, becaus they are so Copious. Now as Odor is a Proper Sensible in itself, so it is also Previous to Sapor, and Smelling, as it were, a Pregustator of the Sens of Tast; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus Odor and Sapor, as I said, are Connatural Qualitys chiefly Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in the same Element of Water; though they are very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:61550:131"/>
in themselvs, as Heat and Light are in Aether, and perhaps more, becaus they are not Simple, but Compounded with other Terreous Qualitys, and require such several Bodys of their own Element, as Waters above, and beneath; and certeinly they must so differ, becaus they are several Sensibles of several Senses, which also very sensibly proves Heat and Light to be Realy D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>fferent, becaus Heat is an Object of Tact, and Light of Sight. Thus there may be more Odor, or more pleasing or displeasing, then Sapor; and so convertibly, in the same Body; but such as are of fetid Sapors have also commonly fetid Odors, and pleasing Sapors no displeasing Odors. And I suppose that vehement and strong O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors or Vapors in any Body do indicate and declare it to be some notable <hi>Pharmacum,</hi> especialy if they be such as are not very grateful to the Senses, which declare it to be not of any Dietical, or ordinary, but extraordinary Use and Virtue. Now as it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that Actual Odors are Immediately Inherent in Vaporous <hi>Effluvia,</hi> which the very Organ of Smelling, that is, the Mammil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary Processes, do sufficiently attest, being situated above the <hi>Nares,</hi> through which, as Tonells, those Vapors do pass; so it is as apparent that Sapors do Inhere in the Watery Juice of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid Body, becaus if that be expressed, it becomes Insipid and the expressed Juyce more Sapid, as Wine, Cider, Perry, Gravy or Juice of Fleshmeat, and the like. And it also appears to me that Odors or Sapors are no Simple Qualitys of Water only, (as Sound and Color are not of Air, or Aether only) but that they are all Mist with some Terreous Simple Qualitys, which are unknown to us, what they are, and yet we may also know, that they are not Odorous or Saporous in themselvs; becaus Elementary Water, or Earth, do not either Smell, or Tast much; as Lucidity and Opacity are not much seen of themselvs, and indeed not without the advantage of Conspissation or some small Mistion, or the like: but, as I confess, I first derived this Notion from the antient Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, who have discovered <hi>Lucidum</hi> and <hi>Opacum</hi> to be the Principles of Color, which I have thus farr improved and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the other three Sensibles, Sound, Odor, and Sapor, that is, all the proper Sensibles, except the fower first Qualitys (which are also in themselvs Simple, and Mist to be made Sensible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too strong and vehement in their own Elementary Bodys) and they are indeed Social, and perhaps Auxiliary Qualitys, with all
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:61550:132"/>
and every the Simple Qualitys of the other Sensibles; as their Proper Sens, which is Tact, is the Fundamental Sens of all the other Senses, as I shall shew heerafter: so I fear to seem too Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and Novell heerin to others, and also doubt, lest by putting too much of this new Wine into old bottles I should offend others; having not any Current <hi>Vocabula</hi> whereby to express the very Names of these Principles, nor Authority enough to Coin them; yet I shall generaly express my Sentiment; of the more Active and Aqueous Principle both of Odor, and Sapor, which I call <hi>Acidum</hi> or Sharp, as also of the Terreous Principle therof, which I shall call <hi>Fatuum</hi> or Vapid; and so leav it to others more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to distribute them. And so I conceiv, that according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Chymical Separation the Vaporous Spirits or Effluxes are more Acid, and the <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> more Fatuous and Stupid; and in Natural Generation and the Process therof, the <hi>Succus</hi> of Fruits, and the like, is first Acid, or more Acerb; and afterward more Sweet, then Strong or Rancid; and at last Vapid: wherin the more Active Quality first prevailing in the Fermentation, doth Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate some such Acid Humor, which makes the Fruit, or the like, more Acid and Poinant, and then by expens of the eagernes therof, by Evaporation, and a more equal Distribution in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of both Qualitys, it becomes more grateful to the Sens, or Sweet; and as that Temperature begins again to be dissolved, more Rancid; and at last when the Active Quality is wholy emit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the <hi>Effluvia,</hi> or Consopited and overcome by the Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Vapid. Thus also the Mouth, which tasteth Meat, hath judged therof,
<q>
                     <l>Infanti Melimela dato <hi>fatuaf<expan>
                              <am>

                  </q>
And therefore generaly elder men delight more in such Acid and Poinant Sapors; becaus their Sens of Tasting is more Weak, and as I may so say, Insipid in itself; and children in Sweet-meats, which are of a more equal Temper, and consequently more suitable to their more exact Sensation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There is an old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem, whether Odors do Nourish? which I suppose may easily be resolved, that they do not, nor cannot Nourish, as Odors; for so Sapors, as Sapors, do not Nourish; becaus they are only Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual

to be Nutritive, yet I know not why Vapors may not Nourish as well as Drink, since they are only Water Rarefied: and there is not only Air, but also much Vapor in the Atmosphere wherin we breath, and which we continualy suck in by such Inspiration: and if that be too pure an Air, and not sufficiently Vaporous, as in the <hi>Andes</hi>; or if the Vapors be more Adusted by Fire of Charcoal, or the like; or Corrupted by much breathing in a close Room, or the like; we feel great want of a more Nutritive as well as Refrigerative Air: and plainly the Birth or <hi>Foetus</hi> while it it in the Mothers Womb, and is Nourished by her, hath no Use of the Lungs, nor Inspiration thereby; but assoon as it is brought forth, it needeth this <hi>Breath of Life,</hi> as it is termed, as well as any other Nourishment, and cannot live, as before, without it; though there was before the same Motion and Heat of the Heart, which did need as much Refrigeration as afterward: and though it may seem very strange that Vapor thus passing Immediately from the Lungs by the other passages through the Heart into the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terys, and not like other Meat and Drink first into the Stomack, should Nourish, without any more Process of Concoction, yet it may be also consydered how much sooner Drink in an empty Stomack is Concocted then Meat; and whether Vapor, which is so much more Rare and Fusile then Drink, need any such Process, and may not by the Heat and Mot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And Springs rise first out of the Earth in very small Sources, and not from
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:61550:134"/>
any such Subterraneous Rivers, as some have supposed, flowing in great Canales under the Earth, and Impelled by I know not what Subterraneous Vapors, like Bloud in the Veins. But though all Water will run to its Levell, yet if it be not also some way Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled, it will run very slowly, and so swell and mingle by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees as it can hardly be perceived to run: wherefore it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in such Cutts and Aqueducts, that if about a foot Fall be not allowed for every Mile, there will be a very litle Current of the Water, wheras Rivers run very swiftly, and some of them with a very Rapid Current; which must be by a farr greater Fall: and therefore the Springs or Sources of all great Rivers must be farr within Land, and also fall from much higher ground; as the Author of <hi>Esdr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

As I suppose, that Rivers run from the higher parts of the Earth, so also that the Main Ocean into which they run is some lower part of the <hi>Cortex</hi> therof, which is the fittest <hi>Alveus</hi> to receiv it; and therefore it is called the Deep: and though I know not how deep the <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> therof is, yet certeinly it must be farr deeper then any of the Narrow Seas, which run into it, otherwise they could not so run into it; and the Narrow Seas must also be deeper then the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers which run into them: and they not only run one into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but with such a force and Current as doth plainly declare a proportionable Fall. And while the Rivers so run into the Sea, yet the Sea is not full; and all these Waters certeinly do
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:61550:135"/>
not sink into the Earth below the <hi>Fundus,</hi> or into any vast <hi>Bara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrum</hi> therof, which would long since have been filled, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently they Flow and Reflow continualy: nor are they Imbibed by the Shores, or Absorbed by Evaporation, which is continualy according to that Reciprocation of Waters and Vapors that I before described, and any Inequality therof can make very litle or no difference in this case. Also we know that Water Impel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Water by Fall or Force, if it hath no Vent or farther Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, will caus the Water so Impelled to rise before it; becaus the Impuls driving it forward, and consequently hindring it from flowing back, when and where it is stop'd, must caus it to rise and swell. Thus the Rivers runing forcibly with such an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puls into the Narrow Seas, and they into the Ocean, beyond which they do not, nor cannot pass, do certeinly caus it to rise and swell toward the Midle by such Motive Impuls and Current of all the Rivers and Narrow Seas on every side therof; and then when it hath so raised the <hi>Pondus</hi> of the Water somwhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Levell of the Ocean, and so farr, as it can rais it no higher; when that prevails against the Impuls, and the Water of the Ocean begins to fall again, it will drive all the Water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween (being a Voluble and Undulating Body) as fast and as farr back again; becaus it was Equivalent to the Impuls which so raised it: whereby the Water between the highest Watermark of the Ocean (to which it did so rise and swell, and from which by reason of the greatest <hi>Pondus</hi> therof it began to fall back) and the highest Watermark of the Rivers, to which it can so fall back, reflows into the Narrow Seas and Rivers accordingly: that is, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Levell in the Rivers, as it before proportionably rose above the Levell of the Ocean: becaus, as I said, it is a Rowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Fluctuating Motion, which will ever be Reciprocaly higher at each end, like the shorter Vibrations of a <hi>Pendulum:</hi> and it doth not rais it so high as the Springs, from which the Fall of the Rivers first began; becaus the Fluctuation doth not reach so farr, forward, or backward; and probably so much Water as is beyond the highest Watermark of the Rivers in the Canales therof, and from thence to the Springs, is by Evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration continualy Exhausted from the Sea; which returning to the Earth doth serv continualy to supply the Rivers, though more or less, according to the Operation of the Aether and
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:61550:135"/>
Planets, especialy the Moon, which caus and regulate the Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration; but generaly so as the Sea is never full, nor the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers empty: and by this Constant supply of the Springs and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers there is accordingly a Constant Fall of the Waters one way, and an answerable Return therof by the <hi>Pondus</hi> of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Ocean so raised thereby, as I have shewed, the other way: as if we suppose a <hi>Pendulum</hi> having a Constant and almost equal Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puls added to it one way, and so Impelling it in every Vibration, it will certeinly so return by its own <hi>Pondus</hi> and thereby Constantly and Equaly Vibrate. And this I conceiv to be the account of Tides generaly; though there are many particular Variations therof, both Ordinary, as the Menstruous; and Extraordinary, as Annual, and Casual: and I suppose the Menstruous, and indeed the Diurnal Variation of the Tides therin, to be from the Moon; not that they do follow her Cours, which is from West to East, for so plainly they do not, the Flux and Reflux being from all Shores to the Ocean, and back again: but as I conceiv, that as the Sun raiseth those Dry Vapors or Fumes, wherof I before dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed, by his vehement Heat; and which caus no such Increas of Waters, as I before mentioned; so the Moon by her more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Heat principaly raiseth those Moist Vapors, which so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into Waters, and caus the Increas therof: and this Influence of the Moon is sufficiently known in many other Instances, but most eminently in Tides, which accordingly observ her two <hi>Apogaea</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when she is farthest from the Earth, and her Heat then most mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate; and so the Tides are then highest when she is New in her first <hi>Apogaeum,</hi> and Full in her Second, every Month, and so propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably every Day between them. Thus I have briefly delivered my Conception of this great <hi>Arcanum</hi>; which I shall leav to be farther examined by others, especialy the most expert Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; and desire them to try it by these <hi>Criteria</hi>: Whether the Tides do not Impell the Main Ocean from both the opposite Shores at the same time? as most probably they should; becaus the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puls of the Rivers and Narrow Seas will not last so farr, and so long, as to drive the Water from one Shore to another cross the whole Ocean, nor perhaps very farr into it; but rather by driving it from both the advers Shores at the same time they make the Ocean to rise and swell a litle toward the midle; as if several men with Brooms, or the like, at the two ends of some long Chanell,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:61550:136"/>
should sweep the Water therin forward both ways, following close after one another, it will thereby be Impelled, rising and swelling toward the midle; and when they ceas, by its own Weight, fall and return both ways back again. Again whether Tides be not less, and less, toward the midle of the Ocean, and about the midle, perhaps Imperceptible, from which the Rivers and Narrow Seas Impelling it are farthest, and so their Impuls more, and more, abated; and the Water driven before them still rising and swelling, the Weight therof is increased; which at length makes the Return therof back again into the Narrow Seas and Rivers? Also whether there be any Perceptible Tide in Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Seas and Rivers between such Tracts of Land which are most longinquous and farthest from the Ocean? or whether they are not proportionably less, and less, as they are farther from it in any Parallel of the Earth? becaus the <hi>Pondus</hi> of the Water rising and swelling therin, as I have shewed, and thereby returning the Waters back again, doth abate by degrees, and may not reach so farr as such longinquous Seas and Rivers. Lastly, I desire it may once be ascerteined by them, whether indeed there be any such Circumterranean Tide, or Cours of the Main Ocean from East to West, as is commonly supposed? which certeinly is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Cours of the Moon, nor do I find any ground or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in my <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> that might induce me to affirm it; nor can the supposed Motion of the Earth solv all the Tides every way. And this Circumterranean Sea is the Main Ocean that I intend, and which, as I conceiv, is chiefly intended by the Congregation and gathering together of Waters, mentioned in the Creation therof, to and from which the Rivers thus flow and reflow, and though it cannot return to cover the Earth, as it did in the first <hi>Chaos,</hi> or since in the Deluge, yet as a <hi>Fascia</hi> it still envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneth it round about, and is the great Province of Elementary Water. Extraordinary Tides are not so consyderable, being Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and Casual; and as they proceed from no such constant and certein Causes, so they have no such certein and constant Courses. The Annual Tides are observed by us in our Southern Coast to be generaly greater about <hi>November,</hi> and <hi>February</hi>; and accordingly we observ that about <hi>November,</hi> when the Heat of the Summer is past, and the Earth is filled first with Water, the Springs begin to rise, as we say, in Fountains, Wells, and

But there are some litle Tides and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripi,</hi> so very strange and wonderful, as have puzled the greatest Philosophers, and I know no Colorable reason or account, which any have ever yet given therof; nor am I such an <hi>Oedipus,</hi> as to unfold these Ridles of Nature, which though they seem to be her ludicrous Disports and Galliards, yet certeinly are accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to some Harmonious Measures, of answerable Causalitys; though we may not hear them or do not hearken to them. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which I shall only relate an Experiment, of which I must freely say, — <hi>Non inventa reperta est:</hi> for I confess I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it from another, who declared to me the Matter of Fact that he had done it, but was not pleased to revele the Secret how it was done, which yet after I had found out he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged unto me to be the same. The Invention was to make a Waterdial, wherin the Water should rise and fall every twelv hours, in this maner. Let there be a Font or Basin of the Dial made with a Hole at the bottom, and let there be a Pipe open at each end, wherof one end must be applied to a Subterraneous Spring, or the like Flux of Water, and the other end closed to
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:61550:137"/>
the Hole in the bottom of the Basin, so as the Water may descend from the Spring (being as high as the top of the Basin) to the Hole in the bottom, and through it reascend in the Basin in twelv Hours: and as it so ascends by degrees every hour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe Lines in that side within the Basin: And at the twelfth and last Line make another Hole in the other side of the Basin, and let a <hi>Siphon</hi> be inserted toward the top of the Basin, and closed to it, so as the Water in the Basin may fill the shorter Leg therof hanging down to the very bottom of the Basin, and just turn over at the <hi>Vertex</hi> of the <hi>Siphon</hi>: and the Cavity of this <hi>Siphon</hi> must be doubly as capacious as the Cavity of the former Pipe, so as to convey away doubly as much Water in the same time by the longer Leg therof out of the Basin, as ran into it through the Pipe; whereby though it continue still to run through the Pipe from the Spring, yet the Cavity of the Pipe being only half so capacious as the Cavity of the <hi>Siphon,</hi> it can run in only half so fast by the Pipe as it runs out by the <hi>Siphon</hi>; which will be sett on runing by the Water ascending into the shorter Leg therof within the Basin, when it rises to the Line of the twelfth hour, and there turns over at the <hi>Vertex</hi> into the longer Leg without the Basin, and that will carry it away doubly as fast, untill the <hi>Siphon</hi> be emptied; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently caus the Water to descend in other like twelv hours: which must also be noted by Lines described on the other side of the Basin: and when the <hi>Siphon</hi> is empty it will ceas runing; and then the Water runing through the Pipe only will ascend into the Basin in other twelv hours, as before, and so conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nualy. But becaus it is somwhat Curious and difficult exactly to make the Cavity of the <hi>Siphon</hi> doubly as capacious as the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Pipe, a Stopcock may be inserted into one, or both of them, whereby the just proportion of Water in them may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly regulated. Now, though I can neither affirm, nor do I know, that there are any such Fonts, Urns, or Caverns, in the Earth, so disposed as in this Experiment, whereby the <hi>Euripi</hi> are caused, yet I know that it may possibly be so; and if not, yet I am assured that both this and any other Regularitys in Elementary Nature, wherin there is neither <hi>Plastes,</hi> nor Artist, must be by some answerable Causalitys; which I leav to others more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to Investigate.</p>

Regions, not only Mathematicaly such, as some have made, both in Aether, and Air, where they are not; but Physicaly such; and yet they have not found them out where they are: for as there are Waters above, and beneath, so there is manifestly both a <hi>Cortex</hi> of the Earth, wherin there are not only many other <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posita,</hi> and many sorts of Earths, Metalls, Minerals, Stones, Chalk, Clay, Marl, Loam, Sand, and several others, which thereby disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and declare it not to be the very Elementary Earth, but also Water flowing in the Canales therof and imbibed by all this Spongy <hi>Cortex,</hi> whence it is denominated Terraqueous, and is almost as much Elementary Water, as Earth: nor is any part therof in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self so purely Elementary Earth, as the Ocean is Elementary Water; wherefore there is most probably another Elementary and Subco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

call Magnetical, is of the same kind with any Cortical Magnets; as they are not of the same kind with Iron Stone, or Mine, though both have a Magnetike Quality: but rather that it is farr more Dens then them, as I have said, as it is also farr more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent then Gold. Nor is it vain or useless (as other Terreous <hi>Composita</hi> below the <hi>Cortex</hi> should be) but very proper and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilite in every respect: for as by the most solid Consistence therof it becomes the Foundation, and <hi>Basis</hi> of the <hi>Cortex</hi> (as they are therefore termed <hi>Strong Foundations</hi> and <hi>Pillars of the Earth</hi>) and indeed of all the Superior Spheres, and of the whole Body of the Universal Globe; so by its Magnetical Polarity it doth continue its own Body in one Immovable Position, as I shall shew heerafter: and most probably it hath no Pores where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it may be penetrated, convelled, or comminuted by any others, or one part therof severed from another; and so many Bodys in the <hi>Cortex,</hi> Marble, Glass, Gemms are Imporous, as I have shewed, much more this most Dens, Compact, and Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantine Body of the Elementary Earth.

Thus though Earth be most Base and Brute of all the Elements, yet it hath also its proper Excellency and Glory, having the greatest Bodily perfection of the Density of the Matter, to which it doth most approxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; and the Spirit therof hath the greatest Stability and Fix<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yet; as I said, Drines is an Active Quality, and Actively contrary to Moisture, and not any less Degree ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and much less only a Privation of Moisture; and though Moisture doth more notably Operate in and upon it, as Heat doth upon Cold; and if it be weakned by Comminution into Dust, or Ashes, and the like, it seems not much to Resist, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Imbibe Moisture, and almost to be Receptive of it; as Matter is of Spirits; yet there is some Mutual Operation, as well as Active Contrariety between them; and so Earth itself is called Dry Land, and contradistinguished from Water in the Terra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queous Globe of them both: and it is known accordingly to Operate by Drines, both to Physicians in their Desiccating <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plastra,</hi> and to Mechanikes in their Cementations; and that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siccation is not only by Evaporation or Exclusion of the Moisture, but also by Mistion of both, and Predomination, and Prevalence of the Drines over Moisture; for so in the utmost Adustion of
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:61550:139"/>
Ashes, or any <hi>Terra damnata,</hi> there is Water, and consequently Moisture in the Mistion therof, which yet is not Actual, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to Potentiality by Driness: and apparently in Congelation of Ice, Glew, Metalls, and the like, there is Water, and so Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture Potentialy, which is again Actuated by Fusion, but is not Actual before they be melted. And, as I said, Moisture, and so Drines, are Indifferent between the other two Qualitys, Heat, and Cold, and they between Moisture, and Drines, and they are no Secondary Qualitys each of other, but Operate only by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs Univocaly and Efficiently; for as Heat only doth heat, and Cold cool, and Moisture moisten, so Drines, and no other Quality but that, doth properly dry; though Equivocaly or Instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly either Heat, or Cold, may dry, as I have shewed. And as I have observed of Heat, that being the most Active and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant of all the Elementary Qualitys, it hath also the most Confinements, Imprisonments, and Restraints, and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ways of Reducing it into Potentiality, as I have formerly shewed, farr more then Cold, which thereby hath such ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage against it; so hath Drines against Moisture by the very Cession therof; for though Drines cannot easily Profligate it, yet is it Naturaly so very Fugitive of itself, that it is still Flying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; wheras Drines is more Fixed, and much assisted therin by its own Connatural Quality of Consistence; so that there is not any Body Dry, which is not Consistent, nor Moist that is not Fluid: and yet Consistence is a several and distinct Quality, both from Moisture, and Drines; becaus they are Actively contrary one unto another; but neither of them to Consistence, nor Consistence to them.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. As Drines and Consistence are not one and the same Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Earth; besides which there are also many other Qualitys therof, as Magnetike Virtue, and the like; and so Heat, and Light, of Aether, besides many other Qualitys therof, as Planeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Virtue, and the like; so likewise are there several Qualitys of Air besides Cold, and of Water besides Moisture, which though unknown to us what they are particularly, yet do generaly appear in the many various Mistions of all the Elementary Bodys; and that want of a more particular knowledg therof is a chief caus and reason why we know so litle of Elementary Mistions: wherefore I
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:61550:140"/>
have begun to pry into them, and advanced some few steps to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them, to shew the way to others; and though I may by some be judged to be too Curious heerin, yet I am confident that there are such other Qualitys of every Element, besides those which are commonly called First, and that I have sufficiently made it to appear that they are such as do not, like Second Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litys, subsist Immediately in the First, and Mediately by them in the Substantial Spirit, but every one of them Immediately therin, as well as another: and so I conceiv Consistence or Firmnes and Drines only to be Connatural Qualitys of the same Element of Earth, and that Consistence doth Immediately Subsist in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Spirit therof, and not in Drines; as Fluidity is not from the other Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>alitys, but rather from the Matter, for so indeed all the other Elements are Fluid; and Consistence is a proper and more particular Property of Earth alone; which hath no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, as Drines hath, nor doth contrarily oppose any one Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the other Elements; but only is that whereby the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Spirit of Earth doth render its own Body Firm and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, so as no other Elementary Spirit, not having any such Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, can Confirm or Consolidate its own Body, which therefore remains Fluid and Weak, as the Matter itself. And this Terrene Consistence as it is not only Drines, nor any Second Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ality ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; so much less is it Density (for so Mercury is Dens but not Consistent) though that also be assistant to it, as well as Drines; for Density, as I have shewed, is not any Active or Spiritual Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, but only an Affection of Matter itself, superinduced or varied by the Densefaction of Spirits, and Spiritual Qualitys; as Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, which is plainly an Affection of the Matter, is superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and varied by the Spiritual Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>alitys: and therefore Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity and Consistence are as different, as Matter and Spirits, wherin they do respectively Subsist: and as I have thus distinguished Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence from other Qualitys or Affections of the Spirit and Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Earth, that thereby we may more discern it, so I shall now shew that it is a Spiritual Quality, and particularly what it is; becaus I do not find it to be sufficiently explained by others; and becaus indeed it is a very Noble Quality of Earth, and of great Mechanical Use: for it is not only a Compaction and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solidation of all the parts of the Earthy Body, but, as it is also termed, a Firmnes or Stability of the whole Body therof, both
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:61550:140"/>
which I comprehend under the name of Consistence; whereby I also intend that Strength and Rigor of the Consistent Body, which though it be no such Vigor or Force whereby it can Move other Bodys, like the Angelical Powers, nor its own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as Material Spirits, nor yet like the Motion of Matter to Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Station, (whereby indeed Matter Moves itself, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Activity or Strength, only by a Recumbence or Succum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bence, as I have shewed) and so Fluidity is only an Inconsistence therof, or Falling every way, without any Consistent Strength, or Stability holding it together; whereby it doth plainly appear that such Motion of the Matter, as well as of Fluid Bodys, is not from any Spiritual Activity or Vigor, but contrarily from Infirmity and Weaknes of the Bodys themselvs: yet Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence doth Spiritualy and Actively Unite and Contein all the parts therof, and also Arrect and Fortify the whole Body, having a proper Center therin, as all Spirits and Spiritual Qualitys have, without any respect to the Center of Matter; which, as I have shewed, is the Universal Center of the whole Body of the World: and so a Timberlogg floating upon Water, or suspended in the Air farr enough from that Universal Center, yet hath in itself a Center of its own Consistence, where it is strongest, and is most hardly Bent or Broken, and from which it proportionably extendeth that Strength or Rigor through all the parts therof unto the Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitys, and so this Consistence therof is Mechanicaly useful to make it a Boat, or Beam of a Balance, which though it be suspended in the more Rare Air only at the Center, yet by this Strength and Rigor all the other parts therof being so Consistent in the whole (though otherwise hanging freely in the same Air) are Arrect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and upheld from falling or bending downward, as otherwise they would; and though the parts therof weigh most toward the Extremitys, becaus Gravity is an Affection of the Matter, and therefore weighs most downward in the Extremitys, which are farthest from the Center of the Consistent Strength, which is a Spiritual Quality; yet that is strongest in the Center, which is most opposite, and farthest distant from the Extremitys; and plainly shews that Consistence is not Density, nor Gravity, which Subsisteth in Density, and that any bowing downward in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitys is rather from the Fluidity of the Matter, whereby all the parts of that Wooden Balance would flow downward, like
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:61550:141"/>
Water, if they were not so upheld by Terrene Consistence. Nor doth Matter Move from, but toward the Center; wheras Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence, as all other Spiritual Qualitys, issueth forth from the Center to the Extremitys, though it be stronger in the Center then in the Extremitys; which Matter is not, as it is Matter; for it is not more Heavy, nor doth it Move more strongly, or rather swiftly as it is neerer to the Center, by reason of the Center; but by reason of the longinquity of the Motion; which would be the same, whether the Body Move in such a Space, and through the same <hi>Medium,</hi> farther from, or neerer to the Center; and so the Weight of a Clock doth not Weigh more, or Move faster when it is almost down, then at first. Also Consistence, which is a firm Union of all the Parts in the Whole, may be such to the Parts in their Private Whole, as Station of Matter is to itself in the Publike Whole therof: for so it keepeth the Parts of any Fluid Body within a Consistent Vessel in Rest, as I have formerly shewed; becaus the Consistence is a Fulciment, which is <hi>quasi</hi> a Center unto them, and wherupon they rest as well as in the N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Station of a more Rare above any more Dens Body, or as they would if they were Immediately next to the Center. Again, Consistence, which is a Spiritual and Active Quality only for the Fixation of its own Body, hath, as I said, no Contrary; being heerin like to Magnetical Virtue, which is for the Polar Positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Body: for Fluidity, as I said, is only an Inconsistence and Infirmity of the Matter, which is not a Contrary, but a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Consistence: and though there be an Universal Union and Coherence of the Matter to and with itself in the Whole, yet there is also such a Mobility of the Parts therof within that Whole, that they will easily be removed, and flow any way, unles they be made to Consist by this Spiritual Quality of Earth; and no other Elementary Body doth Consist by any other Quality of the Spirit therof, but only by this Spiritual Quality of the Earth that is in the Mistion therof: and accordingly Water, which hath more of Earth in the Mistion therof, doth Consist more then Air, and Air then Aether, as I have shewed: and so Terrene Bodys do more Consist as they are less Mist with the other Elements. Nor is the Incoherence of many Terreous Corpuscles, Fluidity, though it seem to be Complexively such; for every Corpuscle therof Simply is Consistent in itself, (as I have before observed of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity) and so though there be many Sands in an heap, yet every
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:61550:141"/>
one of them in itself is as Consistent as a Sandstone, and Dusts of Steel, or Brass, as the Steel or Brass itself: and though by Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therof there may be a Motion every way like the Motion of Fluid Bodys, yet that is not from the Consistent Corpuscles, or any of them in themselvs, but from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he Interspersed Fluidity of Air; as if there be Innumerable Terreous Motes in Water, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les they be Mist and made into a Past, the Water in itself is not thereby made more Consistent. But Bodys which have a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence in themselvs, and have also other Fluid Bodys Interspersed, are made more to Consist in and with themselvs, by exclusion of the Fluid Bodys out of their Pores; as a Cable being stretched very stiffly will be made to Consist almost as much as Wood, and so is used by <hi>Funambuli</hi>; for by stretching the Air is excluded, and the Pores are drawn together and Contracted: and a Wett Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble will be farr more stiff of itself, and not so easily stretched as a Dry; becaus, as I said, Water hath more Consistence then Air, and is not so easily excluded or squeezed out of the Pores; also it is more Imbibed, and thereby more Mist with the Terreous Body of the Cable, then Air, and therefore not so easily Extru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. But heer I must observ, that as it is a general Rule and Canon of Nature, that in all Spiritual Powers and Operat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As a Barr of Wood one Inch square will bear about eight times so much Weight, as if it be equaly divided into fower quarters, any one of those fower quarters will bear; though that hath a fourth part of the whole Magnitude of the other: whereby it appears that the Increment
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:61550:142"/>
of the Consistent Strength therof is about doubly as much as the proportion of the Magnitude; though I do not conceiv that it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way so doubles, but that where the disproportion is greater of the Magnitude, it will be greater also of the Increment, and where less, less. As suppose the Barr of Wood an Inch Square and a yard long, and being equaly supported by Fulciments at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitys to bear two hundred pounds Weight hanging at the Center therof, and a Barr of a fourth part of the Magnitude therof to bear a quarter of one hundred pounds Weight, so that the greater Barr bears eight times as much as the less Barr, which yet hath a fourth part of the Magnitude therof; then also suppose another Barr two Inches square, which hath fower times the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude of the Barr an Inch Square, the Increment of the Strength therof must proportionably be doubled in respect of that, as the Increment of the Strength of that was in respect of the other, and consequently, if the Barr of an Inch square did bear two hundred, as I supposed, the Barr two Inches square must be supposed to bear sixteen hundred pounds Weight; that is, fower two hundreds doubled, as the Barr an Inch square did bear two hundred; that is, fower quarters of one hundred doubled: now the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Magnitudes between these three Barrs are, as I said, of the least to the midst as one to fower, and to the greatest as one to sixteen; and the Increment of the midst in respect of the least is as eight to one, which is doubly fower; and of the greatest in respect of the least, as sixty fower to one, which is fower times sixteen. Also it may be tried in Barrs of other Figures; as of round Barrs of an Inch Diameter, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

And heerin may plainly appear another difference between Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the Affections therof, and Spirits and their Spiritual Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litys: for though Matter by Union doth fortify and defend it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in the Whole against any Nonentity, as I have said; becaus the Extension therof, being Quantity Consistent (which is the only Consistence of Matter) must Consist together through the whole Quantity of the Universal Body therof, as the Extension of any Particular Body must Consist and be Continued through all the Parts therof; otherwise it should not be the same Extension as it is: and therefore though one Part may be removed from one Place in the whole Body of the World to another, yet ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Part must necessarily succeed, to Continue the whole Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion therof, and thereby to render the same whole Body Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete and Intire, and the whole Extension therof Consistent: ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the Union of Part to Part, though never so many, doth not make any Increment of the whole Extension above the Total of all the Proportions of all the Parts; and so an hundred several Weights of one pound of Lead, being melted or otherwise uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together, will not weigh in all more then one hundred pounds; or if the same Matter in a greater Extension be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densated into a less Extension, it weighs only according to the Mass of the whole Matter, and not according to the Extension; and therefore is the same, whether the Extension be greater, or less; though as it is so much Matter in a less Extension, it will penetrate and sink through an equal portion of Matter in a greater Extension, as I have shewed: but yet doth not by such Conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation acquire any greater Gravity in itself, then proportionable to the whole Body of the Matter; as we say, that a pound of

                  </gap> the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Body of Matter, as I have declared: whereas this Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous Consistence being a Spiritual Quality gaineth an Increment of Strength in itself by such Physical Union above the proportions of all the Parts United or added together Arithmeticaly; and so Fire of so many equal Parts United together Physicaly into one Body will heat and burn more then so many several Sparks equal to those Parts, as being United or added together Arithmeticaly will amount to an equal Total. Also a Wire of Iron may be made so small and so long as that it will not bear its own weight at the Extremitys, and Glass so Capillar, as may be wound about the finger, though Glass be very fragile. And though I conceiv Hardnes and Softnes to be only different Sensibilitys of Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence or the degrees therof, as more Consistent doth more resist the Touch, and less less; yet Fragility and Ductility are different kinds of Consistence itself: for Consistence hath both a Strength and Rigor of the whole Body, which Fragility also hath, and Ductility hath not; and likewise a Spiritual Cohesion and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacity of all the parts therof, which Ductility hath, and Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gility hath not so perfectly as proper Consistence: and therefore Fragile Bodys, as Glass, are easily Broken, but will not so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily Bend; and Ductile Bodys, as Wax, will easily Bend, but are not so easily Broken: nor indeed do I conceiv any Body to be properly Consistent, and such as will neither Break nor Bend, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept only the Subcortical Earth, which is Elementary, and hath the proper Qualitys therof in their greatest Actuality; as Aether hath Heat, and Light: wheras other Cortical Bodys, though most Rigid, as Iron, and the like, may be Broken, or Bent; yea by Fusion become Ductile and Fluid: so that Ductility is partly from Moisture; and is only an imperfect Consistence, which though it be not the same with Drines, is very much assisted by it, as I have shewed. Also Fragile Bodys of less Crassitude may Bend more, as I said before of very slender Glass; becaus there is less Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stortion, that is, less Expansion in the outward Convexity, and Compression in the inward Concavity of the Arch, or Angle, that it makes in Bending: and the very Bending before it Breaks shews that there is some Ductility in it, which is an Imperfection
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:61550:143"/>
of Consistence: and this doth plainly appear in Glass heated, which is farr more Ductile, and molten, which is Fusile: whence also it hath that other Imperfection therof, that is, Fragility, which it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trays when it is cooled: but I conceiv that Fragility is a less Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of Consistence then Ductility; becaus that appears in Actual Drines, and this in Actual Moisture. And Fragile Bodys, though somwhat Flexile, yet, if they be not over-bent, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again very smartly to their Position, which we call Springi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and will not stand bent, as we say, as Ductile, unles the Rigor (which is properly every way, as it were, by so many <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dii</hi> from the Center to the Circumference) be overcome by long continuance. And this Springines is only a Return to the Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Consistent Body; (and not as Elastical <hi>Potentia,</hi> which is to the Density or Rarity of more Fluid Bodys) according to that Natural Rigor, or Temper of Bodys, which the Spirits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, and caus to be in them, and from which they are Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently diverted, and therefore so suddenly and forcibly return unto it again, if the Violence do not continue so long as to caus the very Spirit to conform unto that Figure, as I have shewed, though it will hardly conform to that Temper, in Elastical Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys: as also Vegetative and Sensitive Spirits will hardly conform to Inorganical Figures. Now Consistence being not a Compound, but Simple Quality of Earth, therefore it doth contein Earthy Bodys together, if they be Continuous, though very various and different <hi>Composita</hi>; for so it conteins both the Subcortical, and Cortical Earth, and all the Rocks, Mountains, and Eminences therof, as one <hi>Compages:</hi> and so Brick, and Mortar when it is dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, do not only Adhere, as Water and Glass, but Cohere and Consist together; becaus though they be several <hi>Composita</hi> or <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta</hi> of all the Elements, yet their Consistence is common to them all, as they are Earthy Bodys: as Matter doth therefore so Unite it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in all the Bodys of various <hi>Composita</hi> in the World: I have seen an old Brick Chimny undermined and pulled down to fall like a Pillar of Timber without any Breaking; which consequently had one Center of Consistence, that did contein all the Earthy parts therof together, as a Needle hath, which is half Silver and half Steel; and as the whole Body of Matter hath one Center, to which it all tendeth, though varied into the several Bodys of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable <hi>Composita.</hi>

As Siccity and Consistence are not one and the same Quality of Earth, so much less Consistence and Magnetical Virtue, though that require a Consistence, as Consistence doth Siccity: but, as I have said, Consistence doth only Contein and Arrect the Parts in the whole Body generaly and indifferently every way; wheras Magnetical Virtue doth Direct it particularly in one Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Place or Position, (which we call Polar) unto North and South; whereby the Difference between Positive Extension in its own <hi>Vbi</hi> and Relative Place may plainly appear: for a Magnet is in its own <hi>Ubi</hi> as any other Body, but besides it hath such a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Position, which is Polar, whereby the Polar Points therof, North, and South, are so Directed as that they will not be placed otherwise, and so thereby consequently all the other Points and Parts therof in the Whole, though the Whole be only in its own <hi>Vbi,</hi> as any other Body. Also Consistence is without any Motion, for it is the same whether the Body Move, or not; but Magnetical Virtue hath a Verticity to reduce it to its Polar Position. Again Consistence is Orbicular, as the Strength of a Wooden Wheel is equal at the Extremity of every <hi>Radius,</hi> being equidistant from the Center; but Magnetical Virtue is much stronger at the Poles then at the Extremitys of the <hi>Aequator,</hi> as I shall shew heeraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and indeed otherwise it should not be so Polar, or North, and South, more then East, and West. Also Consistence hath no Emanation like Magnetical Virtue; and there are many such other Differences. But yet, as I said, Consistence is an Auxiliary Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity therof, being both Connatural Qualitys of the same Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And so the Elementary Earth probably is most Consistent, and most Magnetical: and the Magnet-Stone is also very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent, and so is Iron Mine, and especialy Iron, and Steel, which are the Extractions therof: and I know not whether there might not be some such Extraction of the Magnet Stone more Magnetical then the Stone or Mine therof: but certeinly the Elementary Earth is farr more Magnetical then any other Magnet, becaus it is Elementary; and also becaus it is so vastly great, whereby there is a proportionable Increment of the Virtue: and this is proved by the very strong Emanations therof which penetrate the whole <hi>Cortex</hi> of the Earth; as appears by the Inclinatory Needle; for Magnetical Virtue, like Consistence, hath no Contrary; becaus
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:61550:144"/>
it is only for Direction and Position of its own Body: though Density, as well as Longinquity, may hinder, or abate it, as they do any other Spiritual Powers whatsoever, but not repell, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect it. Also the Magnetike Earth by the Emanations therof doth Excite and Actuate the Potential Polarity which is in some Cortical Bodys; as Iron Barrs, which have stood long in a Polar Position, or Iron, and as some say Brick-earth, heated and laid to cool North and South; which is not by any communication of the Magnetical Virtue of the Earth, (for no Accident can so Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate out of its own Substance, wherin it doth Subsist, into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) but, according to the Doctrine of Potentiality, which I have formerly delivered, by Univocal Generation or Production of the Magnetical Virtue Potentialy being and Subsisting in those less and weaker Magnets into their Actuality. Also if the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of them or the Magnet Stone be Actual, and they laid in a Position not Polar, as suppose East and West, yet if they ly so long, the Magnetike Virtue of the Earth will Predominate, and vary that Polarity to its own North and South, which is very observable; and as it sheweth that the Earth is the great Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, which in time can so over-rule all these less Magnets; so also that these less Magnets, or <hi>Terrellae,</hi> are such Individualy in themselvs, becaus while they are laid in that Position East and West, which is not Polar, yet they retein their own Individual Polarity, in such a Position as is opposite to the Polarity of the Earth; and though the Earth will at last over-rule them, or if they were freely suspended in the Air they would Naturaly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themselvs to the Poles of the Earth, yet while they are so Violently laid in an opposite Position, they still retein their own Individual Center, <hi>Axis,</hi> Poles, and <hi>Aequator,</hi> apparently distinct, and opposite to those of the Earth; and in that Position will turn another less Magnet freely suspended within the Orb therof from the Pol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Nor is the Polarity from both Northern and Southern <hi>Effluvia,</hi> as others affirm, which cannot penetrate Glass, as Magnetical Virtue doth; for neither is there any penetration of several Bodys, nor is Glass Porous, nor yet Fluid, as Water, or Air, or the like, wherin we may suppose a Cession to any such Imperceptible Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puscles; which are only the Spawn of <hi>Epicurus</hi> his Atoms, and can never be perceived by Sens in any greater or less Bodys so to pass; nor are any <hi>Phaenomena</hi> themselvs, and yet are Introduced to solv the <hi>Phaenomena</hi>: and though they be supposed to be so Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptibly Minute, yet must not only Move litle Needles, but also contein the vast Magnetike Earth in its constant Polar Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, against all the furious assalts of Air and Water, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined force of their Storms and Tempests, being such as could ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily divert these Corporeal <hi>Effluvia,</hi> and so prevent their <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinly the Magnetical Virtue in a Needle is not from any Northern and Southern Atoms or Corpuscles, for plainly it is Excited by another Magnet Actualy, being what it is Potentialy before in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: which evidently appears by the very quick and sudden Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation therof, almost like Heat, and Light, or Sound, and the like;

though it will last longer in the State of Actuality then they, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus it hath no Contrary to oppugn and Corrupt it, like them: and yet rubbing it with another Magnet the contrary way doth assoon reduce it to Potentiality, by drawing it from its Polar Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude, and destroying the <hi>Axis</hi> thereof; (and nothing doth more approve the Doctrine of Potentiality then such Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) The Magnetical Virtue and Motions therof are most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently discovered by the Magnetical Needle carried about a round <hi>Terrella</hi>; for at the <hi>Aequator</hi> it doth apply itself Lateraly to the Magnetical <hi>Terrella</hi> and Parallel to the <hi>Axis,</hi> becaus the <hi>Aequator</hi> of the Magnet, or <hi>Terrella,</hi> doth equaly attract the <hi>Aequator</hi> of the Needle, as also the Poles of the Magnet do the Poles of the Needle, when it is so applied to either of them.

Also it may be tried, how much less the Attractive Power of the <hi>Aequator</hi> is then of the Poles:
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:61550:146"/>
for certeinly the Magnetical Virtue is not equaly Orbicular, but rather Oval, (and that perhaps may discover it, as I before inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated) though we call it an Orb, and it may be so; as there is an Orb of the Emanation of Light from an Elliptical, or other Inorbicular Lucid Body, and yet the Power therof is not equaly Orbicular, as I have shewed: for though the Circumferential Extension from the Center be equal, yet the Circumferential Power in that Extension may be unequal: however it is evident in Magnets that though they be Orbicular, yet their Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is Oval; and so in their Orbs of Magnetical Emanations, the Virtue is greater at the Poles, and neerer to them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably, and less at the <hi>Aequator,</hi> and neerer to it propro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably. And not only the Center, but also the Poles are very Points; as may appear by two Needles placed at one of the Poles, which will thrust one against another to attein the very Polar Point, which doth most strongly attract them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Divaricate at their other ends: as they must according to Statike Law; for there can be no Angular Point of two several Lines concurring in it, without a Divergence of the two Lines from it. Now in this Circular cours of the Needle about the round Magnet it is very observable, that if it be moved about it at a distance, it doth observ the Poles and <hi>Aequator</hi> of the Orb of the Emanant, and not the Inherent Virtue therof, in the Magnet it self, though the Emanant Virtue be not C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now wheras it is a general Magnetike Rule, that the Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Pole of one Magnet to another is of a contrary Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as of North to South, and South to North, the Magnets are accordingly found to Conform themselvs, and the less Magnet will turn about itself so to apply its Correspondent Pole unto the other: which is no Flight of each others Poles, as some have supposed, but a Concordance, and Conformity according to the Magnetike Law of their Nature: and it doth so, not only by Contact of the greater Magnet, but at any distance within the Emanant Orb therof; becaus as the Inherent and Emanant Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the same Magnet make one Intire Orb of the Magnetical
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:61550:146"/>
Virtue therof, though of several and unequal Powers; so also doth the less Magnet endeavour thus to Conform itself within the Orb of the greater Magnet. And it may be tried, whether, as two several Lights in the same place do Colluminate, so these two Magnetike Virtues being so placed together do Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate by their Emanant Virtues. Also if one and the same Magnet be divided into several Magnets, the Individual Pola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Whole will be doubled; and accordingly as they are made by the Dissection two less Wholes, so they will also have two Individualy less Magnetike Virtues; and according to the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>section so will the Polarity of each of them be: for if the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net be dissected by a Line cutting the <hi>Axis</hi> and Parallel to the <hi>Aequator,</hi> then the Poles, Center, <hi>Axis</hi> and <hi>Aequator,</hi> are only doubled; that is, the former Northern Pole in the one, and Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Pole in the other, still remain, and where the Dissection is, there is a new Southern Pole opposite to the former Northern Pole, and a new Northern Pole opposite to the former Southern Pole, and the <hi>Axis</hi> is divided into two, and the former Center and <hi>Aequator</hi> are also changed into two new Centers and <hi>Aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> conformable to the Position of these double Poles: but if the Magnet be dissected by a Line cutting the <hi>Aequator</hi> and Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel to the <hi>Axis,</hi> then the Continuity remaining untill the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>section be finished, (which doth end toward one of the Poles) it is as if Wax were so divided by a Dissection almost throughout, but did stick together only at one end; and then the two branches therof produced and erected one above another, and after the upper part wholy severed from the neather, whereby that last Dissection doth not cutt the <hi>Aequator,</hi> as the first did, but the <hi>Axis,</hi> by a Line Parallel to the <hi>Aequator,</hi> as in the former In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance: and if we could suppose the Magnet to be so produced and erected Corporealy, and then wholy severed, there would be one Pole at the end of the greater part of the Magnet, which we will suppose to continue in the same Position as it was before; and the other part, which is first divided, and then supposed to be so produced and erected above it, must necessarily have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pole opposite therunto, and consequently to that which it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self had before when it was conjoined to the other; and so when it is wholy severed, that part seems to acquire two new Poles of contrary Denominations to the other, though indeed

And heerby we may plainly perceiv the Real Individuality of any Elementary <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positum,</hi> while it is Continuous in itself and Discontinued from others, and the Individual Oeconomy therof in itself; for so the Magnet, while it is one, hath but one Center, <hi>Axis,</hi> Poles, and <hi>Aequator</hi>; and assoon as it is Discontinued, the two Parts have each of them all the same <hi>Apparatus</hi> which is doubled, and so even Elementary Spirits have their Oeconomy, and are Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Majoration and Consociation, as I have shewed. And these two Elements, Aether, and Earth, have not only their Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Qualitys, but also Emanant; becaus they are most remote, and therefore their Emanations are their Emissarys, whereby to operate at distance; wheras Water, and Air, have their <hi>Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via:</hi> but I know not whether they also have any such Emanant Qualitys (which deservs farther Inquisition) for Water, and Air may otherwise Operate at distance; that is, Water by Vapors, and Air by its own Body, which enters into any Pores of other Bodys, or may be Introsucted through them by their Cession, if they be Fluid, as Bubbles are through Water. These two Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

Also they differ in many other things, as in that which I have mentioned, that the Emanant Orb of a round Magnets Body is not of equal Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumferential Power, like the Luminous Orb of a Starr, or other such Orbicular Lucid Body; which plainly proves Magnetical Virtue and Planetary to be very different; and that Magnetical Virtue having no Contrary, like Light, or Heat, is not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fracted, or Reflected; and so the <hi>Radii</hi> therof cannot be conspis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sated and Intended, as the Sunbeams by a Burning glass. And though they do both attract, yet their Attraction is also very different: for Magnets do only attract such other Bodys that are either Actualy or Potentialy Magnetical, and wherof the Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality is first Actuated by them: so that it is indeed rather a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours or mutual Embrace of both, then Attraction of one by the other, like the Attraction of Heat; and Heat may attract cold Bodys as well as hott; for though Cold be contrary to Heat, yet it is not contrary to the Attractive Virtue therof, which doth attract a cold Body, as it is a Body generaly, whether hott or cold; and is hindred only by the Gravity therof, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so some <hi>Remora</hi> to Magnetike Attraction, though both that, and Heat, if they can once overcome the Gravity of the Body at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, do attract with a very quick and smart Motion by their Emanant Rays; and the Magnet very notably, so that an Iron wheel, or Steel <hi>Pendulum,</hi> will either be wholy staid by a Magnet, and suspended like the Inclinatory Needle; or otherwise Move as freely, as if it were out of the Orb therof by its own Gravity: for though Motion of Matter is <hi>per Gradum,</hi> yet Spiritual Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

                  </gap>her. The Attraction of Heat is either by the Inherent Quality therof, which though our new Philosophers deride, yet it is most evident, not only by the Attractive Power of the Vital Heat in Sensitive Bodys In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternaly, but also Externaly of the Heat of Wooll, raw Silk, hott Spices, <hi>Tobacco,</hi> and many Medicaments, which do notably draw; and it may be also very strong, yea stronger then the draught of Hors, or Ox, as all workmen in Furnaces and Saltworks can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test. And this Attraction of Inherent Heat may be not only Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by Contact, but also Mediately by the Emanation ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as in the former Instances: but if the Inherent Heat be not constant, and Fixed, as if it be excited by a litle rubbing, or otherwise, so as it is ready to return again suddenly into its Potentiality, then it attracteth not constantly, but suddenly in a special maner, which is called Electricity, and appears by such rubbing of <hi>Electrum</hi> or Amber, Jett, hard Wax, and some Stones: and is somwhat like to Elasticity, but from another reason; for that is only by violent Expansion of a Body, which the Spirit therof again reducing to its former Density, doth thereby draw other Bodys after it to avoid Vacuity, as I have said: wheras Electricity is by the sudden Generation of Heat, which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly emitteth its Emanant Rays, and then this sudden Cale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction as suddenly ceasing, and the Inherent Heat returning into its Potentiality, the Emanant Rays, which do Subsist in it, must also return into it, and in their Retreat or Resilience, which, as I have shewed, is very sudden and momentaneous, bring back with them small Bodys within the Orb therof, whose Gravity doth not hinder and prevail against the Spiritual <hi>Potentia</hi> therof: wheras a more Constant and Fixed Heat, though it may otherwise draw more strongly and durably, yet doth not attract so Electricaly; as may appear by hard Wax melted, which will not attract so Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctricaly, as if it be only rubbed, and not melted: nor doth the Heat of Flame attract Electricaly, though it be very sudden and momentaneous; becaus it as suddenly passeth away in the Fume
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:61550:148"/>
and Body therof; but yet the Successive Fire therof in the Candle or Wood doth attract, like Inherent Heat; And heerby it plainly appears that Emanant Rays do Subsist in, and flow from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Quality in the Substance, becaus they do thus return to it again; and that even Emanant Accidents, though they flow forth out of their Substances, yet do not Migrate into others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus they do thus return to them again. And now upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, and more fully to explain this very strange Electrical Motion, as I have before discoursed of the Motion of Matter to Union, or Station, Recumbence, or Succumbence, (which though Local Motions, are only such as leaning to, or falling on, without any Active Power or Strength) so I shall now discours of the Motions of Spirits, which are properly Active and Vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and truly Spiritual: and such are the Motions of Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Spirits, which are the very lowest <hi>Classis</hi> of all Substantial Activitys. Thus Heat and Moisture Rarefy their own Bodys of Matter, as may appear in Fusion; and Cold and Drines Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densate them again, when they return to their Consistence: and in all these Variations of the Density or Rarity of their Bodys, there is a Local Motion of the Matter itself Intrinsecaly in the Body therof, otherwise there should be no such Rarefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Condensation; and the Motion of the Matter therin is only Passive, but the Motive <hi>Potentia</hi> of the Spirit, which by its Qualitys doth so Intrinsecaly Distend and Contract its own Body, is properly Active, as well as when it doth Extrinsecaly Expand or Compress another Body; which it may do consequentialy by Rarefying or Condensating its own Body: for so Fire by Rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Powder into Flame and Fume doth explode a Bullet; and though when it Densefieth its own Body the next commonly succeeds by Motion of the Matter to prevent Vacuity, yet this notable Instance of Electricity and all other Attractions by Heat shew also how it may attract another Body, not only by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursion, as two Magnets mutualy meet one another, but by plain drawing without any Corporeal Instruments, and Imm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="285" facs="tcp:61550:149"/>
Balists) doth all together prevail over the resistance, which in longer time and by degrees might prevail against it: and thus if the Rarefaction of Vapor be very great and very sudden, the Execution will be very forcible and quick, and if less, less pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably: nor can I conceiv any other caus of those vast Erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Ejaculations of whole Torrents of such massy Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from Mount <hi>Aetna</hi> to so great a distance, but only the great, sudden, and continual Rarefaction of Vapors happening in some fitt Caverns therof. Also the Planetary Motions of those vast Orbs in such rapid and perpetual courses is very wonderful: which yet are only Elementary. Thus Magnetical, Electrical, and Planetary Motions are indeed by such Natural Magike as I have described; and though I also acknowledg that Emanations may be at the greatest distances, and <hi>Effluvia</hi> may pass very farr, yet I cannot conceiv how any Sympathetical Operations can Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaly have an equal Effect at the farthest distance as at the neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, since no Emanations, <hi>Effluvia,</hi> nor Angels themselvs, do, or can so Operate. Now <hi>Effluvia,</hi> as I have said, are of Inherent Qualitys, as odorous, or others, in and with their Vaporous Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys, and not like Emanations, which are only of Emanant Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys, and which, though weaker then Inherent, yet are more Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Separate from the Matter; and may be easily distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the others; for they penetrate the very Bodys, wheras <hi>Effluvia</hi> only pierce and enter into the Pores therof; also Emanant Qualitys are never Exhausted, but always (while they are in Act and not obstructed) fill their whole Sphere; nor do they weigh, or by their Emanation make their Substantial Bodys to be Lighter; wheras <hi>Effluvia,</hi> though they may be very Rare and Subtile, yet do proportionably diminish their Bodys, and accordingly make them to weigh somwhat less, unless they be also continualy renewed. There is also a great Cohesion and Continuation of Homogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Bodys, which I have formerly observed, though few of them do so attract or concurr as Magnets. It is said, that Gold doth attract the Fume of Mercury, and workmen use to hold a piece of Gold in their mouths to receiv it, which will be notably silver'd thereby; but that may be only by so much of the Fume as doth happen to fall upon the Gold, as Dew upon leavs of Trees or Herbs; yet certeinly when the Mercury doth so fall upon the Gold, it doth notably retein it, being, as I suppose, very Homogeneous
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:61550:150"/>
with it, and that there is much Mercury in the Composition of Gold, and so fixed in it, as that no Fume therof will again be emitted by any Operation of the most Intens Fire, though never so long continued: but there is also some other predominant Principle in the Composition therof, which apparently renders it heavier then Mercury; though probably Mercury be one Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in the Composition of all Metalls (except perhaps of Iron which is Magnetical, and will not be Corroded by it.) There is also a Fume emitted in melting Lead somwhat like that of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, very hurtfull to workmen, and which doth strangely allure Cats, as a sweet Poison, and thereby kill them. But I shall not proceed to discours of Metalls, and Minerals, and the like, which I conceiv to be <hi>Composita,</hi> and the Spirits therof no Simple Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, Created in the Begining, but that they are Mist of such several Simple and Created Principles; and therefore not menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in all the Six Days works, though they and all other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Mista</hi> were then also Improperly Created; and so we read of Gold, <hi>Bdellium,</hi> and <hi>Onyx</hi>: but this general System mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth only such grand <hi>Mista,</hi> as Elements, and Planets, which in the Whole are Ingenerable, and Incorruptible, and therefore are particularly mentioned, as they were so specialy Created.</p>

The Earth, being such as I have described, doth plainly declate itself to be Immovable, that is, not apt to Move itself, (if possible to be Moved by any others) Yet there are some, who not by any Natural Power, nor by Faith, but Fansy, can remove, not only Mountains, but the whole Earth; not by heaping and raising it up to Heaven, as the Poets report of the Giants; but, as if they had obtained the Victory for it, can place it among those Idol Gods, <hi>Saturn, Iupiter, Mars,</hi> and others; which I shall now disprove, having already shewed how the Earth is one whole Element in itself Naturaly, and only Localy United with Water in the surface therof, and so made one Terraqueous Globe in this Third Day; but not with the Aery <hi>Expansum,</hi> which was made in the Second Day; and how in the First Day the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was made to Move about the Earth with the Light therin, Diurnaly, which made Day and Night; and that the Earth was not made to Move about it, but remained in its <hi>Chaos,</hi> untill this Third Day.

Again, as by its own Gravity it is thus united to the Center, so by its own Consistence it doth unite all its Parts together, whereby they will not, nor cannot, Move in the Whole, as Motes in Water: and though it should be supposed to have more Consistent Parts one way then another, yet becaus they are all Consistent, they do not flow every way to fill the Sphere, but all weigh Perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicularly downward upon the same Center, without any Fluctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, Trepidation, or Inclination any other way. And to keep it from being Moved in the Whole about the Center any way, it hath Magnetical Virtue to fix it in one determinate Polar Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, North and South; so that it can neither be Moved out of its Place, nor in its Place, but is wholy Immobile.

to prove it Motive, (and so the Planets are also said to be Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, and both confounded together, which are most different in Nature) I shall now more largely disprove that Assertion, and thereby plainly prove the Earth not to Move. I have granted the Earth to be Magnetical, and I do also grant the Aether to be Planetary; and shall observ a wonderfull Analogy between them; that is, that the Poles of the Earth do so Correspond with the Poles of the Aether, that if the Magnetical <hi>Axis</hi> of the Earth were produced, it would Intersect the Poles of the Ae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I suppose, we all agree, that the Verticity of a Magnet is a Motion from Pole to Pole, that is, from North to South, or from South to North, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridionaly according to the Magnetike <hi>Axis</hi> therof, and not from East to West, or from West to East, about the <hi>Axis,</hi> and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Aequator</hi> therof; and also, that if the Earth did Move Diurnaly, it must Move from East to West, or West to East, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus it is so Illuminated. Now I say, that no Magnet doth, or can so Move, but only from North to South, or from South to North, as may be tried by any Magnet, or <hi>Terrella,</hi> which hath Verticity: Wherefore they greatly err who affirm any such Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Earth, or of any Magnet about its <hi>Axis</hi>; for indeed, if it should so Move about its <hi>Axis,</hi> according to the <hi>Aequator,</hi> it could not also Move from Pole to Pole, according to the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, as I shall also shew heerafter. Nor did the Antients so express the Earth to Move about its <hi>Axis,</hi> but <hi>Circa Medium,</hi> or about its Center; which yet, as I have shewed, it cannot do Diurnaly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus that Motion is according to the <hi>Aequator.</hi> Again, Verti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city which is the only Motion of one and the same Magnet by it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self is not Circular, but only from Pole to Pole Semicircularly; and Concursion of one Magnet to another is not Circular, but Directly Progressive; and therefore it may not be Imagined, that
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:61550:151"/>
the Earth, or Planets, do so Magneticaly Move one about ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as I shall shew heerafter. And though the Verticity of the Earth be Potentialy in it, yet it never is, nor shall be Actual; for unless it could be Moved from its Polar Position, there is no need nor use therof: and such Potentialitys, though they be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reduced into Act<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are not vain, becaus they are Hypothetical, and first suppose a violence, which Nature abhorreth: and so Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraether, as it is Matter, hath Motion as well as all other Bodys Potentialy, but never Actualy: and so the whole Earth hath also Gravity, and the like. And as I have now disproved this pretended Motion of the Earth, by the Magnetical virtue therof, so I know no other Caus assigned of such a rapid Motion therof as must be supposed, that is, about fifteen Miles every Minute Diurnaly, and almost fifty Annualy; and the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nor is there any difference of a Bullet shott from a Gun East, or West, as there should be very consyderably according to this common Calculation, and so of a Bullet drop'd from a a Steeple: but they say, the Bullet also is a <hi>Terrella,</hi> and Moves with the Motion of the Earth; and would prove it by the falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Experiment of an Arrow shot upright from a Ship sailing, and falling down again in the same place: but then if the Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple also were removed, as much as the Ship saileth, the Bullet dropped from it should follow it, which certeinly is not according to the Motion of the Earth, or <hi>Terrella:</hi> and therefore to defend this they have invented another wors Absurdity: That there is, I know not what, Magical Line of Motion still continuing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceding between the Mover and Moved, after the Impression past, and Contact discontinued: but neither doth the Arrow fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing spin any such Corporeal Thread or Line, like a Spider; nor the Archer shooting emitt any such Spiritual <hi>Radius,</hi> like Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Heat, which may so direct the Motion.

Magnetical Stake reaching from the Subcortical Earth, through the <hi>Cortex,</hi> Water, and Air, and, as some say, to the Moon; for Magnetical Virtue hath no such long or strong Orb, like Light, or Heat; as no particular Magnet, or <hi>Terrella,</hi> doth Eradiate like a Candle, or Spark of Fire. Or if it should, yet it could not Move Magneticaly any other Body, that is not Magnetical, or indeed that is not Consistent; as a Stake in a Pond cannot direct the Motion of the Water in it, or Air above it; becaus they are Fluid and not Consistent. Certeinly Birds in the Air, though more Consistent, are not Magnetical; and though a Bullet of Iron be Consistent, and Magnetical, Potentialy, yet if it be not so Actualy, the former Experiments will be the same, as if it were; and if it have the Magnetical Virtue therof Actualy excited in itself, then it is a <hi>Terrella</hi> in itself, and consequently, if the Earth, which is the great Magnet, Move round, so should every such <hi>Terrella,</hi> which it doth not, as may be tried by any such round Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, or Magnet, placed upon its <hi>Axis</hi> in the most exact <hi>Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>librium:</hi> wheras every part of Water, severed from the Element therof, is Water, having all the Propertys therof; and so should every such Magnet be a <hi>Terrella,</hi> as indeed they call it, having all the Magnetical Propertys therof: and some Magnetical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors do therefore affirm, very falsly, that a <hi>Terrella</hi> so placed will Move round like the Earth; who thereby, very truly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg this Consequence; that if the Earth so Move, the <hi>Terrella</hi> must also so Move; wherefore since the <hi>Terrella</hi> doth not so Move, neither doth the Earth so Move: and though a Bullet flying when it is shot from a Gun, by that Violent Motion, doth also Move round, as I have formerly shewed from another reason; yet that may be any other way as well as the same way with the supposed Motion of the Earth; and the Bullet drop'd from a Steeple, and so falling downward, by a Natural Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, doth not, as I suppose, Move round, or not the same way with the supposed Motion of the Earth. Thus every less Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, not being one and the same with the Earth, but Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dualy such in itself, and having its own Poles, <hi>Axis,</hi> Center, and <hi>Aequator,</hi> as well as the Earth, (as may appear if it be laid East and West, in which Position it will a long time retein its own Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, not only different, but advers to the Polarity of the Earth,

And yet we must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev all the Motions therof, which some Philosophers very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently Suppose, and vehemently Impose upon us, maugre all our own Faith, Reason, and Sens; becaus they tell us Scripture is Popular, Reason Ancipitous, and Sens Fallacious; and so all other men must be governed only by the Magistery of their Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sys, which, whatsoever it may be to themselvs, is certeinly no more to others then they can prove by Scripture, Reason, and Sens; in which there is no Fallacy, but only in our Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, which are indeed our Infirmitys, and ought to be rectified and corrected by other right Ratiocinations and Sensations, and not by other Imaginations. Thus wheras I have granted that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the Earth to Move constantly and equaly, though never so swiftly, if we were also carried on it, we should not feel it to Move; becaus we our selvs do not Move, and yet I say, that our Bodys, being also in the Air, should feel themselvs Moved against the Air, though never so calm, but especialy when the Wind bloweth the other way against the pretended Motion of the Earth, which certeinly could not be Insensible; but, as I rather suppose, Intolerable; if their Imagination did not also Summove the Air for us, by supposing both Water and Air to be parts of the great Magnet, the Earth; which is as contrary to all Sens as the other: this Insensibility or Deception of Sens ought to be rectified by other right Sensations, and not by such other Imaginations and Insensibilitys. Again, according to the very Analogy of Decepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the Sens senseth falsly in one case, so it doth likewise in all like cases, becaus there is the same reason therof: And now also I will examin the supposed Motion of the Earth according to this Analogy of that Deception, which they so strongly urge for it, and I shall only change that Vers (which is their usual Tex) accordingly

There is one who saith that both the Earth and also the Aether do Move; becaus, as he supposeth, while one Moveth from the other, the other also Moveth from it; and so that it is all one and the same, whether we affirm the Earth or Aether to Move; whereby he can solv this very <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> of their Motion either way, which I have already re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore having discoursed of the Terraqueous Globe, I shall review it, and consyder whether only Matter and Motion could produce the Spirits and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Qualitys therof; certeinly not Moisture, which is the same whether the Water be Stagnant, or Fluent; nor Drines which is generaly Consistent, and so of the rest (which to prosecute parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly were supervacaneous) but I will now only alter the Scene, and transfer it from Air and Aether to Water; and suppose it to be Tepid, that is, partly Hott, and partly Cold, and also Lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, as it is Diaphanous, and we will admitt it Sonorous and Saporous, and if you pleas, Odorous; besides Moisture, and the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:61550:153"/>
other Simple Qualitys therof; all which may be in the same Instant <hi>per omnia Puncta</hi> of the Water: and if all these which are so Specificaly different in their own Nature, could be only so many several Motions of the same Matter, and we might Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croscopicaly behold them, we should see a most strange Moorish dance, not only of every dancing Corpuscle, but, even in every Joint and Point therof, so many several different and advers ways as must be assigned to make all their several Natures Specifical, and Individual, Simple, and Compound, which is indeed Impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and so ridiculous, as needeth no farther refutation. Again, once more we will alter the Scene from Water to Earth; which becaus I have affirmed to be Immovable in the whole Body of the Matter therof, and also the Spirits and Spiritual Qualitys therof to be least Active, I will likewise inquire into one thing more, which I doubt our new Philosophers had forgott, and that is, whether as Motion in others, so also Rest in the Matter of Earth may not produce the Spirit and Spiritual Qualitys therof, as Dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and others? which though they be indeed less Active then others, yet they are Active and Motive in themselvs: and so Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence though it be most like the Rest of Matter, yet hath a Strength and Center therof, very different from that of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which also of itself is Fluid, as I have shewed: and Magnetike Virtue, though it affect Polar Rest, yet hath also an Intrinsecal Motion of Verticity in itself to restore it unto it. Nor can all the Terreous Qualitys be only less Active Motions of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becaus they are all in the same Instant <hi>per omnia Puncta</hi> in the same Matter, and cannot be so made severaly by one and the same Motion of the Matter, nor can there be so many several Motions therof together, whether more or less Active; wheras all the Terreous Qualitys may be Actualy together in the same Matter, as I have before sufficiently declared of all the other Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and their Spirits and Spiritual Qualitys; and I now shall conclude, that even Elementary Spirits and Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and so Vegetatives were not produced untill the Elements were all Perfected, becaus Vegetatives require an Elementary Mistion of them all, and indeed, a proper Mistion therof, which every Spirit ordereth and governeth, both as Subordinate and Subservi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to itself; but they are not governed by the special Influence of any Planet or Starr, as the Rabbins say, there is not a Starr in Heaven which doth not point to an Herb on Earth, and bid it grow; for as the Globe of Light in the First Day sufficed to make Day and Night, so also the Heat therof was sufficient for Vegetation; as may plainly appear, in that Vegetatives were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced before the Sun, Moon, or Starrs, (and so also Metalls, though others ascribe the Production therof to Planets) which yet are more particularly Inservient and Beneficial to them; as they do also more particularly vary Days and Nights, and all the Seasons of the Year. But Vegetatives were, and still are produced out of the Earth, or Terraqueous Globe, as it is moistned with Water; for the Earth is the Region both of Vegetatives, and Sensitives, and also of Man: and so it is said, <hi>The Earth brought forth Grass,</hi> &amp;c. and it is observed that the first <hi>Produxit</hi> is of Vegetatives; for the Elements which Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately Consubstantiate the Matter were not produced, but so Created in, and with it, in the Begining, whereby they were then Denominated Heavens and Earth, and so are Inseparably united unto it, though they were afterward Perfected in their Mistions, and production of their Qualitys thereby, as I have shewed; and so there is no <hi>Produxit</hi> of Planets, becaus they also are Elementary: wheras, though Vegetative Spirits were Created in the Begining, as it is said, <hi>God made every Plant of the field before it was in the Earth, and every Herb before it grew</hi>; yet they were only Latent in their Elements, and not produced, before the Elements were Perfected in their Mistions and Qualitys; which was previous and requisite to their production, as they also were to the production of Sensitives, as I shall shew heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: and though Vegetatives are of a farr higher and more excellent nature then Elements, yet they were Created in this same Third Day, wherin Earth and Water were Perfected, and were pregnant and parturient of them, and they ready to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, to shew the Continuation of the Work of Creation by God, who never Rested untill the last Instant of the Sixth Day, as I shall shew heerafter, and also the Combination of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:61550:154"/>
Natures with the Inferior; as Man also was Created in the same last Day with Beasts: yet neither could the Elements so Perfected, (and much less Matter) so produce them, nor they produce themselvs, as the Earth now brings them forth, and they Generate others, untill God said, <hi>Let the Earth bring forth Grass,</hi> &amp;c. or as it is Originaly, <hi>Germinet germen</hi>; which imports another way of special production, then the Mistion of Elements, that is, by Germination or growing out of the Earth, so as no Elementary <hi>Mista</hi> are brought forth, and therefore plainly Stones, Metalls, Minerals, and the like, do not Vegetate; for they are neither Grass, Herbs, nor Trees, nor of any such Kind, but only Elementary <hi>Composita,</hi> and Classicaly Inferior to Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives (and so also are the Planets and Starrs, as I shall shew heerafter) nor are they of any midle nature between Elementary and Vegetative, becaus there are no such <hi>Participia</hi> in the Scale of Nature; and though Elementary Spirits are so farr forth Plastical, as to superinduce a requisite Density or Rarity in their Bodys of Matter, and some Regular Figuration, as Orbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and sometimes perhaps Angular; yet they do not Organise them, and make such Members, and Joints, and the whole <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pages</hi> therof, as the Bodys of Vegetatives certeinly; they have no Vegetative Nutrition, Augmentation, and Generation, though they may seem to Grow by Accretion, as Fire doth Generate Fire Univocaly in Bodys pregnant therwith; nor do they grow or sprout of the Earth; or as it is said, <hi>upon the Earth,</hi> as Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens; but abide in their Element. Also Vegetatives commonly grow out of them, as well as out of Earth, and not only Moss, and Ivy, and the like, but great Trees are seen to grow out of Stones, Rooting into them, and as I suppose, cleaving them asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if perhaps the Seeds did not first fall into such clefts; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it is a Noble Instance of the Predominant <hi>Potentia</hi> of Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Spirits over Elementary: for the Root of the Tree is a farr softer Body then the Stone, and therefore cannot cleav it by any Corporeal, but only by a Spiritual Power: wheras I have seen a Birch grow out of an Oak, and not cleav it; which, as I suppose, was produced first by a Seed falling into the Crown of the Oak, where was some Earth, wherin it first Rooted itself, and so grew to be another Individual and Intire Tree in itself; and not like a Branch Ingraffed into another Tree, having one and the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:61550:155"/>
same common Root: and wheras all Vegetatives have Roots, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinly no Metalls, or Starrs, or the like, have any; and Stones are only Poeticaly termed Vive, when they are in their proper Beds, but neither Live, nor Vegetate, any more then when they are out of them. And indeed though Vegetatives do Vegetate, yet they do not properly Live, as I shall shew heerafter, but all their Operations, though farr above Elementary, are as farr be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Sensitive; and are as Subordinate to Sensitive Spirits, as Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary are to them: but as Elementary are Mist one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Composited only with the Matter, so Vegetatives are Composited with them, and are the first kind of Spirits that are Composited with other Spirits; and therefore are first said to be produced, as I have shewed. And as Elementary <hi>Composita</hi> are variously Mist among themselvs, and by their various Qualitys, (which are many more then only one First with a Second Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of another Element attending it, as some have very falsly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, in every one of them) and by all the Changes therof, in their Compositions, and Decompositions, as I have observed, whereby Glass, Stones, Metalls, Minerals, and such like only Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary things, are Generated; so, as I said, there are Ligneous, and other Elementary <hi>Mista,</hi> properly Subordinate unto Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and most probably some proper Mistion to every <hi>Species</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as there is a proper Vegetative Spirit Subordinate to every Sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>Species:</hi> for certeinly the proper Plastical Virtue of any Grass, Herb, or Tree, which doth accordingly Organise and Effigiate it, cannot Organise and Effigiate another Specificaly different from it, and much less any Sensitive Body, which yet is so Organised and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figiated by a Vegetative Spirit, as I shall shew heerafter: nor indeed can the proper Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>alitys of one Spirit Subsist in another; which to affirm, as some do, is more absurd then Migration of Accidents, as it is more to produce any thing Originaly out of itself, then being first produced by another to receiv and entertein it into it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: nor yet hath any Superior Spirit Eminently, as they say, in itself the proper Qualitys of any Inferior Spirit, becaus they are proper to the other; which though Inferior, yet hath also its own proper excellencys, whereby it is known to be, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is what it is; and so Vegetative Spirits only do Vegetate, as well as Sensitive only Sens, and Intellective only understand. Thus though there are fower Elements, and no more, of which all the
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:61550:155"/>
various Elementary <hi>Mista</hi> are made, yet Vegetative Spirits are Indefinite, and so it is Indefinitely said of them, that they were brought forth after their Kinds; and perhaps Vegetative Spirits are more various then any others, becaus they are also Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to every Sensitive <hi>Species,</hi> wheras there is only one Sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Spirit so Subordinate to Intellective, that is, to the Spirit of Man. But though the <hi>Species</hi> of Vegetatives are not enumerated, yet there are three <hi>Genera</hi> therof mentioned, Grass, Herbs, and Trees, if the same Word <hi>Germen</hi> may also signify <hi>Gramen,</hi> and be not only a general Name of all Vegetatives, which then must be subdivided only into Herbs, and Trees, (as they only are menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned afterward to be for food of Man) but as it is often rendred Grass, so I rather conceiv it in the largest sens: certeinly it is not only a Tender Blade, for they were all made Perfect and Mature; and wheras Herbs are said to have Seed, and Trees Fruit, if there is Grass also, which hath neither Fruit, nor Seed, I conceiv it ought so to be intended therof. Yet I do not sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Mold, or the like, to be any perfect Vegetatives, Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately Created by God, but rather Meteorical Vegetative <hi>Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sita,</hi> and only Imperfect Rudiments of Vegetation; and so likewise the Excrescences of Vegetatives, as Jews Ear, Sponk, Agarike, and the like, which are somwhat like Wens in Sensitives; as there are such <hi>Anomala</hi> of any Material Spirits, which are Generable and Corruptible, though neither of Matter, nor Immaterial Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which are Ingenerable and Incorruptible. And thus I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Vegetatives growing in Water, as Duckweed, and the like, to be Anomalous; for it is said of perfect Vegetatives in their Creation, Let the Earth bring them forth; and so they were said to be upon the Earth, and not upon the Water: and as all Grass hath a Root, so I conceiv any Vegetative which hath no Root, to be Anomalous. Also Moss, and Sponge, which is a kind of Seamoss, are Imperfect Grass; but that which we commonly call Grass, having a Root, Leaf, and Spire of Grass, is, as I suppose, the first perfect Vegetative. And I shall consyder first the Root, which is a Bulbous Substance, and hath generaly more of the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getative Virtue in it then the Blade of Grass, or <hi>Calamus</hi> of Herbs, or solid Trunk of a Tree, being also Esculent and Medicinal; and is in itself the Mouth of Vegetatives sett Downward in the Earth, wheras the Mouths of Sensitives are Upward, and not fixed to their
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:61550:156"/>
Element, but more discontinued, becaus Sensitive Spirits are not so united to the Matter as Vegetative, nor Vegetative as Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary. Also though the Root be the Mouth, and partly as the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach of Vegetatives, yet the upper parts of Plants above the Earth do likewise perform the Concoction, as may appear by a Cion, which doth over-rule the Stock heerin; and the Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the Root is for Nourishment of itself, and perhaps pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory for the upper parts, as that of the Oak is for Ivy, or Mistleto; for properly Plants have no Stomach, or such a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Coquine, as Sensitives; though as they have a more special and proper Elementary Mistion which they order and govern for themselves, as I said, so consequently a Radical Heat, Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, and those other Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>alitys, with a certein Proportion and <hi>Acme</hi> therof, to which they grow up, and then decay again, as well as Sensitives<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but these seem not to be so Powerfull and Operative in themselvs, as the Vital Heat, and the like, in Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitives, and are much assisted by external Heat, and the like, and therefore grow most in hotter and moister weather: and this Woodmen observ in their situation to the Sun and Winds, and notably in cutting Wood in the Spring, that as the Air is more hott, or cold, and the Wind changeth from South to North, the Sap will rise and fall again, as Water in a Weatherglass: but it riseth in hotter, and falleth in colder weather, and not contrarily, as it doth in the Weatherglass, becaus it is not ruled by any such Expansion, and Elastical <hi>Potentia,</hi> as I have shewed of the open Weatherglass, but only by Rarefaction of the Juyce itself, which plainly causeth it to ascend through the Pores or Cavitys of the Plant, like Vapor in the Air: nor are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts of Vegetatives so Actualy hott, as of Sensitives, whose Concoction is generaly best performed, when the Ambient Air is more Cold, and not as of Vegetatives, when it is more hott. Yet the upper parts of Plants seem also to Attract by their Heat, though not so much as Sensitives. It is a Curiosity much affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to make Equivocal Plants and Fruits, which cannot be so well effected as in Sensitives, whose Seeds are Fluid, and more easily Mist; though I conceiv the most probable way to be by some Unition of their Seeds, and especialy such as are Homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous, or more Homoeogeneous, as Mules are commonly Generated by the Mistion of Equine and Asinine Seeds: also it
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:61550:156"/>
may be tried by Unition of their Roots, but then care must be had in slitting and dividing them; for Gardiners say there is a Centrical part of the Root, which if it be pricked through with a Pin, it will never grow; as there is an <hi>Apex</hi> or <hi>Gemma</hi> which Ants bite off in Seeds. The Leaf or Blade of Grass, which is only an Ornament of other Plants, is the Body therof above ground, and is more Esculent then Leavs of Trees; but both Blades and Leavs are generaly Green, which is a most equaly Mist, and therefore most gratefull and inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Color, and so most fitt for their common Covering; and they plainly shew, how Green is Mist of Blew and Yellow, for when the Blew, which is more Opacous, and Subsists in the stronger Juice, decays, together with it the Leavs turn Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and fall. The next Rank is of Herbs, which besides Leavs have a Stalk to exalt and support them, interceding between the Root and the Leavs; and that is generaly an hollow <hi>Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> not so strong and Ligneous as the Trunks of Trees, but more Stramineous, and first only a Blade of Grass, and not any <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus,</hi> and it is commonly strengthned by Joints and Knotts, which also serv, as Val<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="300" facs="tcp:61550:157"/>
Plant doth Univocaly Generate after its Kind, as I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Third sort is of all other perfect Vegetatives, which are neither of the others; and they are described to be Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, as the Original word imports, that is, Arboreous; and though some of them, as Vines, Brambles, and the like, be less Ligneous, and need other Trees to support them, yet themselvs also are Trees, according to this general distribution of Plants, and we do not call them Herbs; as Terrene Reptiles are Beasts, and not Fishes. And all Trees grow up first from softer <hi>Sur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I have seen Oaken wood digged out of the Sea Beach (where formerly the Tree had grown, and was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown and overwhelmed by Inundations, after long lying in the Salt Juice therof) as hard and firm as the beforemention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Corall also, which is a <hi>Frutex</hi> of the Rocks, is very hard, when it is out of the Water; and perhaps not so very tender under it as is commonly reported; though when the thick Juice therof is desiccated, it is most Lapideous. And I suppose some such cold and gross Juice is the caus of Petrification; not so much by Conglaciation, as by reduction of a fitt Juice in the Body therof to such a Consistence; and plainly Stones of Fruits are so denominated from their almost Saxeous hardnes. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they become such Caskets for Seeds, which are Natures Gemms; and yet we cannot conceiv their Induration to be any Conglaciation, but rather Desiccation; for Earth and Water are most Congenerous Elements, and as they are composed into one Terraqueous Globe, so they have a greater Intermistion: and as Metalls may become Fluid by Fusion, so may these <hi>Succi</hi> be Indurated and fixed by Drines and Consistence; though as Heat is assistant in the one, so may Cold be in the other. But Trunks of Trees, though not hollow as Stalks of Herbs, have their Porous passages through which the Sap doth ascend, and commonly by the most Spongy part therof, that is, the Pith, which is formed by the Bubbling and Spumeous Vapor ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it, and is fixed by degrees; as may be seen by Birds Quills, which have litle Bladders left in the Cavitys therof, though their Pith is more Constipated in the Feather. And
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:61550:157"/>
there is observed to be some such hollownes in Hairs; and both Feathers and Hairs are Vegetatives, though Subordinate parts of Sensitive Bodys; and yet they have neither Seed, nor Root properly, becaus they are not properly Individuals in themselvs, but parts of others; and so they are Analogous to Leavs and Flowers, and of as Beautifull and more strong Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, and many of them perfectly Black. Also the Sap doth not only ascend through the Pith, but notably between the Wood and the Bark; and in the ascent is Concocted into Wood every year, as may appear by the Circles therof very visibly in more sappy Trees, as Willow, Ash, Birch, and the like, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, knowing the several years growth therof, you may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the Gain or Loss, according to the proportion of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority of the latter Circles, and Interest of the yearly Rents precedent: and the Sap may also rise between these Circles, and through the very Pores of the Wood, as Bloud in Sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Bodys may Transudat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> through the Flesh; for the Tree will sprout, and shoot forth, every where; and hollow Trees without any Pith may bear Fruit: and indeed the Bark or Skin, which is outward, is more requisite to the Vegetation of the Tree, then the Pith or <hi>Medulla,</hi> which is inward: and as it will hardly Live, as they term it, without a Bark, so if that be bound, it will not thrive, which therefore is cured by cutting: for, as I said, Vegetative Spirits in Plants being much assisted by the Temperature of External Qualitys (as also by Internal in <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals</hi>) are as easily hurt by the Distemperature therof, from which the Bark servs to defend it; and as it so defends the Body of the Tree, it thereby suffers much weather-beating and adu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion in itself, which makes it so Rugous and harsh. And becaus the External Heat draws the Sap outward, as well as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, therefore the Pith is commonly Insipid, but the Bark very strong and Stiptike, as may appear by Tan; and so is the Wood itself more then Pith, as appears by the Salivous Oil of Oaken wood which issueth out at the ends in burning, and is very Astringent and Desiccating: so also the Rinds of some Fruits, as Orenges, Lemons, Citrons, and the like, are very Spirituous and Sapid; but then that Pith, which is next to them, is very Insipid. There is another Character of Trees, which is their Fruit; not particularly of every Kind of them, for all
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:61550:158"/>
are not Frugiferous, but generaly, becaus most of them are such, and others which are not so, yet being Ligneous, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise like unto them (and so not to be accounted Herbs, or Grass) are therefore also Trees: and they are generaly thus described, becaus this was the chief end of Vegetatives, to be food for Sensitives; and the Fruits are most Esculent, wherin also, as in Flowers of Herbs, the Seeds of Trees are conteined more Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, as it is so said, <hi>whose Seed is in it.</hi> All Plants grow out of the Earth Perpendicularly, and so the Earth doth nourish them: and thus all Grounds bear only according to the Plane or Levell therof, and not according to any Convex or Concave <hi>Superficies:</hi> as a Park may be Impaled with as few Pales, though the ground be rising and Indented, as if it were plain and Poll; becaus all the Pales stand Perpendicularly, though it require more Rail proportionably, becaus the Rail runs Horizontaly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Superficies,</hi> and yet we thus measure and purchase Lands, which bring forth the other way. And heer I shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv, that wheras it is said, <hi>The Earth brought forth Grass, and Herb yielding Seed after his Kind, and the Tree yielding Fruit, whose Seed was in itself,</hi> God in these Six Days made them and all other things in their <hi>Acme</hi> of Perfection, as well as <hi>Adam</hi> in his Adult State, and so every way Good; for thus Vegetatives were made not only Complete in themselves, but pregnant with their Seeds, and ready to propagate others; and to this Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Perfection of Vegetatives and Sensitives was added the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Benediction, <hi>Increas and Multiply</hi>; according to the Kind Specificaly: and so God having sett in order Original Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration by Improper Creation, as I have shewed, transmitted it to the Successive Generations of Nature. And wheras it is a common Problem whether any Poisonous Vegetatives, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise Noxious, as Briars, and Thorns, were before the Fall and Curs? I suppose by Analogy of Nature, that as then, though there could be no Elementary Qualitys Actualy Existing in their Extremitys, yet they were very Intens and Predominant in their own Elementary Bodys; as the Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

as now, which we therefore call Poisons in respect to <hi>Animals,</hi> though they be indeed Eminences of Nature in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs; and so also Briars, and Thorns, and such others, as are no Anomalous but Perfect Plants: but I suppose that <hi>Animals</hi> were preserved from Poisons by a Natural Abhorrence, and Discretion, having all their most exact Senses, and Bodily Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraments, which would not accept of any other food then what was suitable therunto; and so they might also avoid Briars, and Thorns, and the like, as they pleased; whose Berrys are also food for Fowls: but I also suppose that there was no such Excessive Quantity therof, as since; and that this was the import of that Curs of the Earth, <hi>Thorns and Thistles it shall bring forth</hi>: that is, wheras before of itself it brought forth abundantly all sorts of Vegetative food for Man and Beasts, and such Poisonous Herbs, and Noxious Plants, as rarely as it doth now good Fruits; so then <hi>vice versa</hi> it should bring forth abundantly Weeds, Thorns, and Thistles, and the like. Thus I have briefly and generaly discoursed of Vegetatives, as before of the fower Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, according to this Divine History, which is an Universal System of the World, both in the Proper and Improper Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on therof: nor do I intend any particular Historys of them, as <hi>Solomon</hi> spake of them all, from the Ceder of <hi>Lebanon</hi> to the Hysop that is on the wall. But heer, before I conclude, I shall again desire any who will rightly consyder the Nature of Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives, to try whether they also may be made only by Matter and Motion, without their own proper Plastical Spirits, which the Earth did bring forth; and as I have observed the fower Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were before perfected and prepared in order therunto, without which the Matter alone, as so consydered in itself (though indeed it can never be without the Consubstantiation of Elementary or the Superaethereal Spirit) hath no Automatous Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of itself, nor, when it is dislocated, any other then to Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Station, as I have shewed, which is only to recover its due Rest and Position; and therefore certeinly it cannot also Move from Rest, which is Naturaly contrary therunto, (as Verti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city is to Polar Position, and therefore cannot be from it) nor hath it any such Plastical Virtue of itself which may guide the Motions therof, but would be only Equidens and Orbicular; wheras Plastical Formation of all Vegetative Bodys, and much

more of the Bodys of Sensitives, is constantly so Symmetrical Organical and Curious according to every Kind, and <hi>Species,</hi> and the successive Propagation therof, and they so very various and different, that he who will not believ Divine Authority, nor Natural Reason heerin, may satisfy himself by his own Sensation, and making use of his Microscope Inspect the most admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Structure and Mechanism of the least Vegetative, or Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive, which is composed farr otherwise, and beyond the most admired workmanship of any <hi>Bezaleel, Daedalus, Apelles,</hi> or <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

And I also observ, that wheras it is said of all the other Days Works, when they were finished and perfected, generaly, <hi>God saw that it was Good</hi>; it is said of that first Created Light more particularly, <hi>God saw the Light that it was Good</hi>; though also afterward in the same Day he divided the Light from the Darkness: but as I have before observed of the three Inferior Elements, Air, Water, and Earth, that it is not said, <hi>God saw that it was Good,</hi> untill they were all

perfected, and the whole Work finished; so though Day and Night Artificial were made generaly by the division of the Light from the Darknes in the First Day Natural, yet becaus they were also to be more particularly distinguished by the Luminarys, and to be so ruled by the two great Lights expressly made for that purpose, that is, the Sun to rule the Day, and the Moon to rule the Night, therefore the Goodnes is not pronounced of Day and Night in the First Day, but in this Fourth Day, wherin the whole perfection therof was consummated: so accurately exact is God the Author of Nature, and Scripture, both in his Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Expressions. And though the common Light, and Day and Night thereby, in Aether, and the ascent of Vapors in Air, and eduction of Earth above the Waters, and madefaction ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by them, was sufficient for the product<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>on of Vegetatives, which therupon were Immediately produced, as I have shewed; yet before the Introduction of Fishes and Fowls into the Water, and Air; and Beasts and Man into Earth; it was requisite that the Aether, which Sensitive <hi>Animals</hi> only can behold, and by the Ligh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And though these Luminarys were made after Vegetatives, yet they are not therefore Vegetative, or of a Superior Nature above Vegetatives, as Vegetatives are above all that were made before them, and as Man the chief of all was made last; for though indeed this Order is observed in each of the Parts of the Creation; and so the Creatures made in the last were respective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more excell ent, then they which were made in the first Part therof; yet the Luminarys, which were made in the first of the last three Days, are much Inferior to Vegetatives, which were made in the last of the three first Days; for they are Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and of the Elementary <hi>Classis,</hi> though chief <hi>Composita</hi> of the chief Element, Aether: but all Elements and Elementary things are Classicaly below Vegetatives; and though Planets have Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comotion out of their places, which Vegetatives have not, but only in their places, being all Rooted in the Earth; yet Loco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion is also in the Matter, when it is dislocated, and indeed

<pb n="312" facs="tcp:61550:164"/>
doth not, as I shall heerafter demonstrate of the Moon. Thus the Magnetical Planetary Motions are very different, and indeed oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site in their very Natures, and Ends; for Planetary Virtue makes the Planets to abhorr all Rest, and Magnetical Verticity is to reduce Magnets to their Polar Rest. Wherefore we may not confound them, though they are both Elementary Motions, and not only Motions of the Matter, or only by the <hi>Pondus</hi> therof, as the Flux and Reflux of Water; nor by Impuls, like Winds in the Air, wherof I have formerly discoursed; nor yet any Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, Sensitive, or Intellective Motions, wherof I shall discours heerafter: as indeed all things are Motive or Mobile one way or other within the whole Globe of the World, and the Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rential Superaether, and Centrical Earth are only Immobile: and as we are Sensibly satisfied concerning Magnetical Verticity, so thereby we may conceiv of these other Planetary Virtues, which God produced in this Fourth Day in the Planets, as he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Magnetical Virtue in the Earth and Magnets. Whereby also it plainly appears that Motion is not only of the Matter, but also that Elementary Spirits may have a Motive and Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Power in themselvs, as well as any other Superior Spirits; and from their different kinds and ways of Motion we may collect the very different Motive Powers and Virtues of the several Movers: wherof Matter is most general, and only tending unto a State of Rest in the whole Body therof, and Center of itself; wheras Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets have a more particular Position of their Bodys, which is Polar Rest, North and South, and a Verticity particularly to reduce them to it; and Planets have their several and various Positions, and Courses, and an answerable Planetary Virtue, which so setts them, and Moves them, and makes them to abhorr all Rest, and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getative Spirits are more Plastical, but Involuntary, and Sensitive Spontaneous or Voluntary Movers, and more indifferent either to Motion or Rest. And thus as Magnetical Bodys may Move from Pole to Pole Semicircularly by their Magnetical Verticity, so we may very well conceiv how also Planets may Move Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, which is only a continuation of Motion through the whole Circle, whereby also they may so Move Perpetualy; and as the Needle doth leap to the Loadstone by the Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Virtue Actuated in itself, which Motion is Progressively Locomotive, so may also Planets by their Planetary Virtue,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:61550:164"/>
which is always Actual in them, Move Progressively in the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which they describe; but though the Magnetical Virtue which setts the Magnetical Body in one determinate Polar Position may be removed, as I have shewed, and pass from that part of the Magnet wherin it now seats itself, and which thereby becomes Polar, unto any other part therof, and so render that Polar, as may be sensibly seen in any <hi>Terrella,</hi> (whereby it is plainly proved that the Magnetical Virtue is a Spiritual Quality, which can so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move itself from any part of the Body of the Matter to another, and not any fixed Affection of the Matter itself) yet Planetary Virtue, being seated in the whole Orbicular Body of the Planet, doth not, nor can it, so remove itself; becaus it always posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the whole Body, not Polarly, or Ovaly, but Orbicularly; or at least it is therefore not to be discerned so to vary its own Situation in the Planetary Body. Now, as God in the First Day did Actuate that proper Aethereal Virtue, which also may be termed Planetary, causing it thereby to Move about the Inferior Globe from East to West in fower and twenty hours or therabout, whereby he made Day and Night, which could not otherwise be, without such a Circumgyration of the Aether, and of the Globe of Light therin, as now the Aether doth still Move with all the Planets and Starrs in it, (whose Planetary Virtue is diversified into several other Motions, which yet are all only Planetary Motion Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricaly; as if, wheras the Polar Position of the Magnetike Earth is only North and South, God should have diversified it in other Magnets or <hi>Terrellae,</hi> and made some East and West, and so to any other Points) so it is also said that in this Fourth Day he made <hi>Lights in the Firmament of Heaven to divide the Day from the Night</hi>; that is, to caus more particular Variations therof, longer, or shorter, sooner, or later, and the like; which must be by their Planetary Virtues Actuated in them, whereby they Move respectively in the Aether, as the Aether doth about the Inferior Globe; and so they were not only for Days, but also for Years, Months, and the like, which, though more or less then the Solar Year, are the respective Years of their particular Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, Lunar, Jovial, or the like, as we commonly call them. And so God made not only the two great Lights to rule the Day and the Night, (that is, the Sun and Moon as both Scripture and Nature do declare) but it is said, <hi>He made the Starrs also.</hi> And
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:61550:165"/>
                  <hi>God sett them in the Firmament of Heaven,</hi> so as to perform these several Offices by all their various Courses. Thus I conceiv that the Aether having the Planetary Virtue therof Actuated in it in the First Day, when God said, <hi>Let there be Light,</hi> a great part of that Aethereal Light was divided from the common Light of Aether, which was left and still is in the whole Body ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, though not so Visible to us; and that Globe of Light, as it was generaly Connatural with the Aethereal Light, being in one He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mispere of Aether, was carried about Diurnaly by it and with it, and not any other way by any special Planetary Virtue in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, which was not Actuated before this Fourth Day; but that this common Globe of Light so divided, and wherof we have no other account, was the <hi>Chaos</hi> of the Potentialitys of all the Plane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Virtues, which were afterward educed out of it; and that then they were not only Moved in and with the common Aether Diurnaly, but by their own special Planetary Virtues Predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in them, and directing every one of them to Move accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their several Courses; for though Locomotive Virtue be common to Aether, and all Aethereal Bodys, yet the Motion of Aether from East to West Diurnaly was by a proper Planetary Virtue, as I have said, Actuated in it, when God so divided it from that Globe of Light (which is eminently called Light and made Day; and so mutualy that Globe of Light) from the rest of the Aether, and Aethereal Light, (which is Comparatively cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Darknes, becaus it made only Night, as I have shewed) And so this particular <hi>Chaos</hi> of all the Planetary Potentiality<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nor is it less wonderfull, if we right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly consyder it, how they Move in their several Zodiaks; being indeed no such Gemmeous Studds, or <hi>Bullae,</hi> fixed in the Aether, as some have imagined; for both the Aether, and they also, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Aethereal Bodys, are Fluid; nor do they Fly, or swim therin, by any Spontaneous Power, like Fowls in the Air, and Fishes in the Sea, becaus they are not Spontaneous: but they are all
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:61550:165"/>
                  <hi>Aetheruli,</hi> as I may so term them; and so their Original Globe of Light was only such a particular Portion of the common Body of Aether, not differing from the rest, but only as it was more Lucid; for so it is said of the formation therof, that <hi>God divided the Light from the Darknes,</hi> in the Aether, but not any part of the Aether from the Light; or the Light from it: nor is the Body of the Sun, or any Planet, more Condensated, as I have shewed; though they shall heerafter sink through the Fluid Aether to the Air and Earth at the Last Day, when they shall be discomposed and disordered, wheras now they are Connaturaly adapted to the Aethereal Heaven: and so it is said of the Light; <hi>Fiat Luminaria in Expanso,</hi> and they are all equaly Expanded in it; but their Light is farr more Conspissated, as it was in their Original <hi>Globus:</hi> and yet such Conspissation of a Spiritual Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity doth not make the Lucid Body to be more Dens or Grave, which also proves Light not to be Corporeal, but a Spiritual Quality, as I have said: and indeed, as all Heat doth Naturaly Rarefy, so should they be rather made more Rare and Light thereby, but that Aethereal Bodys are already as Rare as any Elementary Power can make them to be; and yet though we may easily conceiv them, being Equirare with the common Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Aether, to be poised therin, as Glass Bubbles in Water: it is also to be consydered, why, or how, they should still Move in their Regular Circularitys, and not to be diverted or removed, as such Glass Bubbles may very easily be: and we have the true account heerof in the Text, <hi>Posuit,</hi> he sett them so at first, and so they are still continued, not by an Immediate Manutenence; as he doth not Move them by an Immediate Manuduction, but by the same Planetary Virtue Actuated in them, and causing them Naturaly so to Move in their own Zodiaks. Now becaus, as I have observed, there is no <hi>Produxit</hi> of any of these Planets, as there was before of Vegetatives, and afterward of Sensitives; and indeed, becaus there was such a Globe of Light decided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from the Aether, which was the common <hi>Chaos</hi> of them all, and wherof they were so many particular Decisions, I conceiv that they were so many several <hi>Composita</hi> made therof, whereby they are all thus different, and several one from another, as they are all from the Planetary Aether, (as it is said God divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their Light and the other Aethereal Light) and that every
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:61550:166"/>
one of them is a Specificaly different <hi>Compositum</hi> in itself: and that every Individual Planet is such a <hi>Phoenix</hi> in its kind, that it is also a whole <hi>Species</hi> in itself: wherefore it is said that God particularly made, not only the <hi>two great Lights,</hi> but <hi>the Starrs also,</hi> and so it is said, <hi>There is one Glory of the Sun, and another of the Moon, and another Glory of the Starrs; for one Starr differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from another Starr in Glory.</hi> And therefore their Creation is thus specialy mentioned, and was the whole Work of this Fourth Day, and so I conceiv, there are no such Aethereal <hi>Compositae,</hi> as Stones, Metalls, Minerals, are Terrestrial <hi>Composita,</hi> and wherof no such special Creation is mentioned, as I have observed; but neither that there is a Simple Spirit of every one of them, Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Begining by a Proper Creation. And I conceiv that these vast <hi>Individua,</hi> which are also so many <hi>Species</hi> in themselvs, made Immediately by God, as I said, can neither be Naturaly diminished, nor multiplied, as Comets, which are Anomalous, may be: for so the Starrs are said to be for ever, and it is said of God their Creator and Preserver, <hi>He telleth the number of the Starrs, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them all by their Names,</hi> though Supernaturaly and Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously he may compose a new Starr, as probably that which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared at our Saviours Birth was such an extraordinary Starr, and so is specialy called, <hi>His Starr</hi>; which yet did not continue, but, after it had performed the End for which it was made, was again dissolved: for otherwise the Ordinances of Heaven, which are said to be Unchangeable, should be changed, and the Constel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations therof disordered. And though the Starrs be every one such a several <hi>Species,</hi> yet there is also a Combination of them all generaly, as they are all one Host, and of some more specialy, which are called Constellations, and are not only such in Name, but also described to be such in Nature: so wheras it is heer said, that God made the greater Light, that is, the Sun, to rule the Day, and the less, that is, the Moon, to rule the Night, the Psalmist saith, <hi>To him that made great Lights,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Sun to rule by Day,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Moon and Starrs to rule by Night,</hi> &amp;c. where he divideth the Moon and all the Starrs, as a Separate Constellation from the Sun alone, and attributeth unto them their several Offices to rule by Day, and by Night; for though all the Starrs do not attend the Moon every Night, yet they do by turns; and therefore she alone is said to rule the Night, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:61550:166"/>
she doth so every Night, more or less: and though, as I said, the common Aethereal Light divided from the whole Globe of Light, (which was the Stellant Light, and wherof the Planets and Starrs were all made afterward) did make the first Night, as that Globe of Light did the first Day; and that Nocturnal Light is therefore called Darknes Comparatively, which had neither Moon nor Starr in it, yet in order to Sensitives, who need more Nocturnal Light, the Moon and Starrs, or a great part of them, were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in this Fourth Day, to rule the Night; whereof therefore there is also such an Additional Expression, <hi>To rule over the Day, and over the Night, and to divide the Light from the Darknes.</hi> Thus also more specialy there are said to be Courses of the Starrs, and many of their Constellations particularly named, and their Cooperations denoted, <hi>Canst thou bind the sweet Influences of</hi> Pleiades, <hi>or loos the Bonds of</hi> Orion? <hi>Canst thou bring forth</hi> Mazza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roth <hi>in his season? or, Canst thou guide</hi> Arcturus <hi>with his Sons?</hi> Now wheras some have Curiously inquired in what time of the Year the World was Created; which the Poets fansy to have been in the Spring, becaus that indeed is the time of Renovation; and the Rabbins in the Autumn, becaus then all Fruits, and the like, are in their Perfection, as they were first Created; certeinly neither of their Computations can be true of the very first Creation in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining, for then there was no Year, nor any Commencement ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; but only Day and Night generaly in the three first Days; and in the Fourth Day, the Planets were made for Days, and for Years; and then they must also calculate their Computation for the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of Paradise; otherwise, when it was Spring in one part of the Earth, it was Autumn in the other; as it is now to us and our <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podes.</hi> But such is our Human Vanity, that we will Curiously pry into those things, which God hath thought fitt to Concele, and yet not acquiesce in those things, which he hath pleased to Revele.</p>
               <p n="2">II. In the History of the Creation of the Planets and Starrs it is farther said of them, that <hi>God sett them in the Firmament of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to give Light upon the Earth.</hi> Wherefore certeinly they are all Lucid, not only as all Aether is in itself, but so as to give Light upon the Earth, otherwise they could not so give Light upon it; and so certeinly the Earth is not Lucid in itself, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:61550:167"/>
it should not need to be Illuminated by these Heavenly Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minarys. Thus as the Apostle saith, <hi>There are Bodys Celestial, and Bodys Terrestrial; but the Glory of the Celestial is one, and the Glory of the Terrestrial is another</hi>; and so neither are the Planets any Magnets, nor the Earth a Planet, but, as several Elementary Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they differ Genericaly, and have their several Generical Glorys, that is, their different Goodness described and expressed in the History of their Creation, severaly in several Days: and which also evidently appeareth in Nature, as may satisfy any, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept such who being confounded in their own Understandings can also confound Heaven and Earth, which differ farr more and otherwise then the Aether and Planets differ one from another; for they are Bodys Terrestrial, and Bodys Celestial, wheras these are all Genericaly Bodys Celestial, though they also Specificaly differ one from another in Glory: And of all these Celestial Bodys the Sun is incomparably most Glorious; who, as I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, alone is opposed to the Moon and all the Starrs, and also preferred before them all; for they with his Solar Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations and Secundary Light only make Night in the backside of the Earth, which is but as the Shadow of his Diurnal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and therefore is still called, Darknes: and so he is said to rule by Day, and they to rule by Night. Whose darting Rays penetrate through all the Spectable World, and are bounded only by the two common Bounds of Nature, Superaether, and Earth; and in all the Elementary World there is <hi>Nihil simile, aut secundum.</hi> Wherefore Heathen generaly worshiped him as a God, who yet in the Scale of Nature is farr Inferior to the Vegetative Deitys of <hi>Egypt:</hi> but they who place him in the Center of the World, and fasten him to it, though otherwise they almost Idolise him, yet heerby they even deprive him of that true Glory which God and Scripture ascribe unto him: and therefore, as I promised, and becaus it is so pertinacious a Controversy, I shall now again prove the Earth not to Move about the Sun, but the Sun and Aether about the Earth; and that the Glory of the Celestial Bodys is to Move about the Terrestrial, and to bestow their Influences upon them, and of the Terrestrial to Rest, and receiv all their Benefits. Thus the Text saith expressly, God made the Luminarys to give Light upon the Earth, whereby they Rule Day and Night, and
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:61550:167"/>
all the Seasons; and therefore they are called Ordinances of Heaven, and not of the Earth; as God saith, <hi>Knowest thou the Ordinances of Heaven? Canst thou sett the Dominion therof on the Earth?</hi> Now where the Rule and Dominion is, there is also the Motion and Action, whereby it is exercised; and so thereby the Planets are said to divide the Light from the Darknes, which the Earth should rather do, if it did Move about the Sun, and the Sun should only minister, and as it were hold a Candle to the Earth Moving about it: and it is also said in the First Day, that God himself so <hi>divided the Light from the Darknes</hi> before Sun or Moon were made, and thereby made Day and Night: and as the Sun doth now divide the Diurnal Light from the Nocturnal Darknes by his Light, so doth the Moon divide the Nocturnal Darknes from the Diurnal Light by her Light, and so she was made to rule the Night, as well as the Sun to rule the Day; which certeinly she doth by her Motion about the Earth, and therefore so doth also the Sun by his Motion about the Earth: wherefore <hi>Ioshua,</hi> who was the Disciple and next Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor of our Divine Philosopher <hi>Moses,</hi> saith <hi>Sun stand thou still upon</hi> Gibeon, <hi>and thou Moon in the vally of</hi> Ajalon. Which conjunction of Sun and Moon had been very incongruous, if the Sun did not Move as well as the Moon Diurnaly, as he doth also Annualy, and she Menstrualy; but <hi>Ioshua</hi> should rather have said, Earth and Moon stand still, or only Sun stand thou still; for so he had spoke either properly and truly, or Popularly, as they term it, that is, falsly: wheras it is most absurd to conceiv him to speak both properly and Popularly, truly and falsly, at the same time, and in the same words. And wheras they say this was only Popular speaking, they thereby do acknowledg that Mankind was antiently of this Opinion before <hi>Pythagoras, Leucippus,</hi> and other Graecian Wits fansied the contrary, and therefore propounded it as their Novell Invention; though I am not satisfied that they affirmed any more then the Diurnal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Earth about its own Center, to save, as they supposed, the vast Aether so great a labor; but I conceiv that they allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Sun also to Move Annualy, aswell as the Moon Menstrualy: wheras our new Philosophers (whose Inventions are only Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and their Additions some greater Absurditys) will Move the Earth, not only Diurnaly, but also Annualy; which is both
<pb facs="tcp:61550:168"/>
contrary to Reason and Sens, as I shall shew heerafter, and also most contradictory to Scripture, the Authority wherof no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian should contemn, much less oppose; and that saith expressly, <hi>The Sun stood still, and the Moon staid:</hi> and though it is true, that the Sun doth not Move Diurnaly by his own Planetary Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, as he doth about his <hi>Axis,</hi> and Annualy; but is carried about by the Diurnal Motion of the Aether, which so Moves by its own Planetary Virtue, as I have shewed; yet even so the Sun Moves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Aether Diurnaly; for Motion being, as I said, only a Transition from Place to Place, though the Sun doth not so change his Place in the Aether by the Diurnal Motion therof, yet he doth in and with the Aether thereby change his Place in the whole Body of the World, and consequently Move; as Rare Bodys do Move Localy in ascending upward, though they are Moved Virtualy by the elevation of more Dens Bodys, as I have shewed: and so also the Sun, and Moon, and Starrs, and Aether itself, staid in all their Motions, according to the Context. <hi>So the Sun stood still in the midst of Heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole Day</hi>; whereby, as <hi>Siracides</hi> interpreteth it, <hi>One Day was as long as two</hi>: and afterward the whole <hi>Chorus</hi> of Heaven proceeded to Move again according to all the several Motions therof, as it did before: and certeinly the other is <hi>Maledicta expositio quae corrumpit Textum,</hi> and destroieth the very Literal meaning of such an Historical and Memorable Matter of Fact: and though I hope such Interpreters of Scripture may be true Believers of Matters of Faith, yet the wild Liberty of such Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons doth so farr render Scripture no Scripture, by an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment only of the Letter, which they dare not deny, and yet by denying the Sens, which they will not admitt. Wherefore plainly I will proceed to deal with them as I would with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, or any others, that is, by Reason and Sens: Now, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they affirm three Motions of the Earth, I will accordingly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin them, and first clearly explain them, becaus I doubt they are not sufficiently understood; nor indeed the very Doctrine of Motion generaly; which some make only to be Remotion or Distancing of one Body from another, and so confound the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one Body with the Rest of others, as I formerly observed; and others confound opposite Motions from East to West, and from West to East; and generaly all confound Locomotive Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:61550:168"/>
and Passion, which are very different, that is, one a Moving, and the other a being Moved, as I said, the Sun Moveth Actively in his Annual Motion, and Passively in his Diurnal Motion; and though both these be only Motions or Transitions in themselvs, yet clearly one is an Active Motion, and the other a Passive Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which though they may not differ as Motions, yet do so dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer as they are Active or Passive; and as they confound Motions, so also the Terms of Barocenter and Center, and Poles, <hi>Axis,</hi> and <hi>Aequator,</hi> and the like, as I have shewed, which are Aequivocal Names according to the several Natures of the Things wherof they are expressed; for so they may be either only Mathematical, as all these may be painted and described on any Globe of Wood, or Stone, or the like, Indifferently, becaus there are no such things Physicaly in the Bodys therof; or also Physical, either in Terrestrial Bodys, as Magnets, wherin the Magnetical Virtue doth caus them all to be Physicaly to fix the Magnetical Body accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly in one determinate Polar Position; or in Celestial Bodys, as Planets, wherin the Planetary Virtue doth caus them also to be Physicaly to Move the Planetary Body accordingly in such a determinate Cours, as I have formerly shewed, and shall now upon this occasion clearly discover; whereby we may no longer confound ourselvs with such confused Notions concerning things which are so different and distinct in their own Natures, and whereby the Truth itself shall evidently appear. And I shall make the Body of any man himself to be the Diagramm, and suppose him to throw a Bowl from him, certeinly while the Bowl Moveth from him he doth not Move from the Bowl, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus he standeth still in the same place and at the same distance from the Jack or mark, toward which the Bowl runeth, and which doth not stay in the same place where it was, and so cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinly if the Sun Move about the Earth, the Earth doth not Move about it. Again, I will suppose his Right hand to be East, and his Left West, and his Face before, and his Back Behind; and so let him throw the Bowl with his Right hand forward, or before his Face, toward his Left hand; this, as I have supposed, is as a Motion from East to West: but if he be an <hi>Ehud,</hi> or <hi>Scaevola,</hi> let him throw the Bowl with his Left hand forward, or before his Face, toward his Right hand, and then this, as I have supposed, will be Motion from West to East, which certeinly is an opposite
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:61550:169"/>
Motion to the other; for so if two several Bowls were thrown at the same time by two several men, as before, in the same Line, they would meet and oppose one another: but if the first Right-handed man, after he had thrown the Bowl from his Right hand before his Face to his Left hand, should with his Left hand pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to throw it behind his Back to his Right hand again; though this be from Left to Right, yet it is still from East to West, and not opposite to the former Motion; becaus that was before the Face, and this is behind the Back, and so only a continuation of the former Motion, and the Circle that it describes: and if two several men should in the same Line so throw one Bowl before his Face to his Left hand, and another behind his Back to his Right hand, yet they should never meet, nor oppose, but follow one another: and so the Sun Moveth about the Earth from East to West, and not from West to East, but Diurnaly.

                  </gap>ak, keeping the same Position as before, that is, having <hi>Aethiopia</hi> as the Forepart, and <hi>Guiana</hi> as the Backpart, we must suppose an East Point in the <hi>Vbi</hi> of the Sun, opposite to <hi>Spain,</hi> or the West Point in the Earth, and then the Earth must Move from that East Point to the West, whereby <hi>Aethiopia</hi> may be next opposite to the Sun, and not <hi>Guiana</hi>; for as East is Relatively opposite to West, and West to East, so the Correspondent Points of the Sun and Earth must be Relatively East and West, and opposite one to another; and so consequently must their Motions be Relatively opposite: and however we may call East West, or West East, or that which is Relatively East in respect of one Body, may be West in respect of another, yet in the same respect it cannot be both East and West; nor the same Motion in the same respect both from East to West, and from West to East; but as such, they must necessarily be different and opposite. Thus by fixing fower such Correspondent Points in the Body or <hi>Ubi</hi> of a Globe or Circle, we may fix our apprehensions of the Position, or Motion therof. And though thus farr I acknowledg that the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> generaly may be solved, if either we should suppose the Sun to Move about the Earth from West to East, or the Earth about the Sun from East to West Diurnaly, supposing also <hi>Aethiopia</hi> to be the Backpart, and <hi>Guiana</hi> to be Forepart, which are as different and opposite Positions one way, as East and West are the other way; yet certeinly the particular <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> of that Position cannot be solved both ways, becaus it is only one way, and not the other: for though we may call the Forepart the Backpart, or the Backpart the Forepart, or they may be so in other Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive respects, (which plainly proves Place to be such a Relative Position, as I have shewed) yet they cannot be so in one and the same respect: wheras certeinly the Real Position of each of the Bodys of the Sun and Earth, whatsoever it be, is one and the same, and not different and opposite to itself; but the Position of one is Relatively different and opposite to the Position of the other: and so consequently are there Motions. Thus also I
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:61550:170"/>
grant, that though the Sun, which, I say, Moves from West to East Annualy about the Earth, should Realy Move about it from East to West without any supposed variation of the Position therof, whereby the Sun, proceeding from <hi>Libra</hi> to <hi>Cancer,</hi> should first Illuminate <hi>India,</hi> or the East, and next <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> or the Forepart, and not <hi>Guiana,</hi> or the Backpart, yet the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> generaly might be thereby solved, and there should be the like Aequinoxes, Solstices, and all other intermediate Illuminations, throughout the Year, in all the Earth; but this particular <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon</hi> can not be solved thereby; for since we know that <hi>India</hi> is first Illuminated, and <hi>Guiana</hi> next Annualy, by the Sun passing from <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> and so to <hi>India</hi> and <hi>Guiana, India</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be first Illuminated, and <hi>Aethiopia</hi> next; becaus such diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and opposite ways of Illumination cannot be without diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and opposite Motions of the Illuminator, that is, of the Sun about the Earth; and such different and opposite Motions cannot be at the same time in the same Bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y of the Sun, and in the same Relative respect to the Body of the Earth. And so it may be, though we suppose the Earth to Move Annualy about the Sun one way or other. Thus wheras it is said, that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Sun Move about the Earth, or the Earth about the Sun one way or other, the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> will be the same, it is true generaly of such as are Relatively the same one way or other, (as it is so in all such Relations) but not of such particular <hi>Phaenomena</hi> in themselvs Positively, which must be only such as they are, and cannot be otherwise. But this I only premise, and do not insist upon either of these two Motions Diurnal, or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual; becaus, as we do affirm two Active Motions in the Sun, that is, one about his own <hi>Axis,</hi> and the other in his Zodiak or Circle which he describes, and which is his Annual Motion; and though indeed the other be not his own Diurnal Motion Actively, but the Motion of the Aether, yet we cannot deny, that it may be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed that there are two such Motions in the Earth, which therin may be Annual and Diurnal Actively; and both these Motions must be supposed, becaus though the Sun cannot Illuminate the Globe of the Earth standing still, and only by turning about his own <hi>Axis,</hi> but must be Moved about by the Aether Diurnaly; nor otherwise then by describing a Circle about it Annualy; yet the Globe of the Earth may be Illuminated by the Motion of the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:61550:170"/>
Earth itself about its own Center toward the Sun standing still; but the great <hi>Criterion,</hi> as I conceiv, is, that wheras only two Motions are ascribed to the Sun, and a third to the Aether, which is another Body Moving also the Sun in and with itself, whether the Earth alone can have all these three Motions in itself, as it must have to solv the <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> of the very Motion therof. And now I shall first prove this third Motion to be Necessary, and afterward to be both Absurd, and Impossible; lest having shewed the Absurdity and Impossibility any may afterward deny or doubt the Necessity therof. And heer again I shall make himself that denieth or doubteth it to be the Diagramm; and let him place a Terrestrial Globe, how he pleaseth, on one of his hands, supposing it to turn round also of itself about, according to its own <hi>Aequator,</hi> like the supposed Diurnal Motion therof with either Pole toward his Body, as if the Earth were in <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,</hi> or <hi>Capricorn,</hi> and suppose his Body to be the Sun, and so let him turn his hand with the Globe on it from the Right part of his Body toward the Left, or from East to West, like the supposed Annual Motion of the Earth in the Zodiak therof, without any third Motion to Incline the Poles one way or other; and then the same Pole therof, which was Inward or next to the Body, or S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And now I shall shew the Absurdity of such a
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:61550:171"/>
supposed third Motion of the Earth, if it were Possible in Nature. We all agree that the Earth is Magnetical, or that like every Magnet, or <hi>Terrella</hi> it hath two Poles or Polar Points, exactly North and South, without any the least Inclination or Variation in themselvs, either toward East, or West; and nothing els can make the Earth, which is the great Magnet so to Incline or vary from the Polarity therof, which is according to its own Natural Position; though less Magnets may be Inclined or varied by great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or by being fixed in a contrary Position. Now as these two Polar Points must be Correspondent to two such Points in the Body of the Superaether, if that be Immovable, as we suppose, or in the <hi>Vbi</hi> therof, in the Position of the Whole, though the Parts may Move round therin; so also to two like Points in the Aether, which, if the <hi>Axis</hi> of the Earth were produced beyond the Poles therof through the Aether to the utmost Circumference of the Globe of the World, it must Intersect, and so Terminate in two such Points in the utmost <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Superaether: though these two Points or Poles of the Superaether may be only Mathematical; and however some deny that there are two such Physical Points or Poles of Aether to direct the Motion therof, as I have shewed, yet generaly it is conceived that there is some Physical Correspondence between them, and the Poles of the Earth; and therefore some assigne the Influence therof, or of some Northstarr about the North Pole, to be the Caus of the Polarity of the Earth; and others ascribe it to some Northern and Southern Atoms, flowing and reflowing thence forward and backward, I know not how; and every Astronomer tells us that there are such Poles, <hi>Axis,</hi> and <hi>Aequator</hi> of the Aether. All which Opinions, whether true or fals, presuppose such Poles or Points in the Aether, and that they some way or other Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spond with the Poles of the Earth, which this <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of the Inclinatory Motion of the Earth doth deny, and suppose only a Northern and Southern Hemisphere of the Aether, to which the respective Poles in the Earth may point and Correspond in every Part and Point therof, according to such an Inclinatory Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whereby if an <hi>Axis</hi> were produced beyond the Poles of the Earth to the Aethereal Hemispheres, each Pole so produced would vary through all the sixteen Points or more of each He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misphere; as a Directory Needle doth, when it is Moved vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:61550:171"/>
from North to South, vary each of the Poles therof through the sixteen Points or more of each side of the Compass: but as the <hi>Terrella</hi> or Needle doth not Naturaly so vary in the least maner from the North and South Points, wherin only it resteth, so it is most Absurd to affirm that the whole Magneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Earth doth so vary, or hath any other Position then exactly North and South: for, as I have before shewed, though the Body of a Magnet may indeed be so varied, and that part which was Northern become Southern, by the Magnetical Virtue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving in it; yet the Magnetical Virtue itself is alway and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Polar, that is, exactly North and South, and cannot be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, for then it should ceas to be Magnetical, which must also be Polar Naturaly: and the Magnetical Virtue of the great Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net the Earth is Inalterable by any greater Power in Nature, which might remove it, as appears by the Inclinatory Needle, which alway conformably Inclines to the same two Points of the Body of the Earth, which are also the two Poles of the Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Virtue therof. But now I shall prove this Inclinatory Motion of the Earth to be Inconsistent with the Diurnal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therof, and therefore Impossible: for it is about its own Center according to the Meridian of its own Body, as the other is also about its own Center according to the <hi>Aequator</hi> of its own Body; which two Motions of the same Body at the same time are Inconsistent, and consequently Impossible. I have already shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how a Body at the same time may Move about its own. <hi>Axis</hi> according to the Parts, and also Progressively according to the Whole; as a Cart-wheel Moveth runing down a hill; or any Planet Moving about its own <hi>Axis,</hi> and also Progressively in the Circle that it describes: and so also the Motion therof about its <hi>Axis</hi> may be one way, as from East to West, and the Progressive Motion the other way, as from West to East; as sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose an undershot Wheel runing down a declive Chanel of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which shall also carry it about its own <hi>Axis</hi> one way, while it runs down the other way: and so the handle of a Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

from the Right hand to the Left hand: And the <hi>Satellites</hi> about a principal Planet do describe Hemitrochoids, as I may so term them, whereby it most evidently appears, that they are not, nor can they possibly be so Moved by the Spheres, for it is not only by a Circular, but a Progressive Motion; so as if while by the <hi>Axis</hi> a Quernstone were drawn forward Circularly, by the Handle it should be also Moved round about the <hi>Axis</hi>; the Handle would describe such an Hemitrochoid about the <hi>Axis.</hi> Also I grant that three, or more, several Motions may be in the same Body at the same time, by several Movers: as suppose a Ship sailing round, and describing a Circle Zodiacaly, like the Annual Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Earth; and a Globe Moving in the Ship about its own <hi>Axis</hi> according to the <hi>Aequator</hi> therof, like the Diurnal Motion of the Earth; and a Fly Moving upon the Globe according to the Meridian therof, like the Inclinatory Motion therof; the Fly doth not only so Move upon the Globe, but is also Moved by the Globe according to the Motion therof, and the Globe, and consequently the Fly, by the Ship according to the Motion therof: and so there may be in the same Body at the same time as many several Motions as you pleas; for the Body doth not Move itself Actively according to all these Motions, but is also Moved Passively by others; which is as great a difference, as there is between Action and Passion, as I have shewed. Now, though I grant, that there may be an Active Motion of the Body itself according to the Parts about its own <hi>Axis,</hi> and according to the Whole Progressively, either in a Direct, or Circular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, yet I deny that the same Body at the same time can Actively Move itself any more then these two several ways; as that while it Moves about its Center one way, it can also Move about its Center any other way, or that while it Moves Progres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively, according to any Line, Direct, or Circular, one way, it can Move Progressively according to any other Line another way: which plainly is as Impossible, as that the same Body at the same time should be in several Places; for so indeed it must be, either according to the Parts, if it could so Move about its Center, for then the same Part must be in or upon several Points at the same time; or according to the Whole, if it could so Move Progres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively; for then the Whole must be in or upon several Lines at the same time: and it may be tried by a round Bullet of Iron

or Lead marked with the two Poles, and an <hi>Aequator,</hi> and Meridian, and then place it on a declive Bord on either of the Poles, and it will run round according to the Meridian, from Pole to Pole, by the Gravity therof; but if by the Prepotence of your hand you sett it up like a Top according to the <hi>Aequator,</hi> with one Pole on the Bord, as before, yet it will not run round, as before, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Meridian from Pole to Pole, but slide down turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round according to the <hi>Aequator</hi> only upon that one Pole, becaus it cannot Move both ways at the same time, though it doth Move about its <hi>Axis</hi> according to the <hi>Aequator</hi> by the Impressed Motion, and Progressively downward by the Gravity at the same time; but as it cannot then Possibly Move Progressively any other way then downward, or in or upon any other Line at the same time then as it doth then Move: so neither can it Move about its <hi>Axis</hi> any other then one and the same way that it doth Move at the same time. And so, as I have shewed, though there may be supposed a Diurnal Motion of the Earth about its own Center according to the <hi>Aequator,</hi> and an Annual Motion Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressively in the Zodiak or Circle that it describes, yet there cannot also be a third Inclinatory Motion about the Center accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Meridian; becaus there cannot be two Motions about several <hi>Axes</hi> therof according to the Meridian and <hi>Aequator,</hi> or about the Center of itself, as I said: especialy since the Diurnal Motion of the Earth must be about the <hi>Axis</hi> according to the <hi>Aequator,</hi> and the Inclinatory about the Center according to the Meridian, not only thus severaly, but one Diurnaly, and the other Annualy, as I have said; (whereby it should Move both slower and faster about its own Cen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Others suppose the Earth should be more Mobile, becaus it is less then most of the Luminarys, (which I believ was the first occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of this Error) but they consyder not also, that it hath the least Motive Virtue, which in the Aethereal Bodys is more proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable to their Bulk; and so the Sun is fitly compared to a <hi>Strong man,</hi> or Giant, <hi>runing his Race,</hi> which he can do more swiftly then the Dull and Dwarfish Earth.

serviceable to the Earth: nor are there any such several Spheres in the Aether, as I have shewed; but the true Spheres of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Globe are most Orderly and Circumferentialy situated about the Terraqueous Globe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the Center of them all; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Eccentricitys, Epicyclicitys, Hemitrochoids, or the like: and so the Air doth encompass it, and the Aether the Air, and the Superaether the Aether: and thus Spheres properly and most conformably relate to their inmost Orb, and not all, or any one Orb in the Aether to the Orb of the Earth: for so one Orb doth not relate unto another, nor can Convex Orbs so comply, as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave Spheres, with any Orb; nor can they otherwise be Centers either of Gravity, or Extension, one to another; becaus there can be but one Center to which all <hi>Gravia</hi> do tend, as I have shewed; and Orbs applied one to another make the greatest Chasms between them in their Extension. And thus there is the greatest Conformity both of the Situation of the Elementary Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys, according to their more or less Density, downward; and of the Elementary Spirits therin, according to their more or less Activity, upward; wheras if the Sun should be supposed to be, or have, the Center of the World in himself, he must also be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be the most Dens and Dull of all Elementary Bodys, who is the most Glorious and Active of all Elementary Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: and as he, and the Moon, so also all the Starrs, were made to divide the Day from the Night, and to be for Signs, and for Seasons, and for Days, and for Years, which is accordingly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by their due and determinate Situations; which however they may appear unto us, yet by their very various Positions, yea their Eccentricitys, and the like, they do so produce those varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys of Seasons, and their <hi>Annos Saturni, Iovis,</hi> and others; and observ such Orderly Courses, as if we did rightly understand them, we should easily conceiv, and confess, that it would be a great Monstrosity in any of them to be placed otherwise.

Also it is Sensibly evident that the Moon is not an Earth, nor the Earth a Moon; becaus the Moon is Luminous, but the Earth Opacous, though very much Illustrated by the Sun; which becaus it is denied, and will also concern all the other Starrs, therefore I more willingly undertake to prove it; though it be only a Superfoetation of the former Error. It is expressly said, that <hi>God made two great Lights,</hi> that is, the Sun, and the Moon: wherefore the Moon is a Light or Lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary as well as the Sun; and greater or less Light doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but affirm, the less to be a Light as well as the greater:
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:61550:176"/>
and so they are both termed Synonymously and Univocaly <hi>Lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naria</hi>; and not the Sun <hi>Luminare,</hi> and the Moon <hi>Speculare,</hi> as some men would make her to be: and so it is said generaly of them and of all the other Planets, and Starrs, <hi>Let there be Lights in the Firmament of Heaven</hi>; and so indeed is the whole Aether both Calid and Luminous, though yet less then the Moon or Starrs, becaus Heat and Light are the common Aethereal Qualitys, though there may be farr more in one Aethereal Body then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becaus their <hi>Composita</hi> are Specificaly different; but as they are all more Genericaly Aethereal, so they must all have their Generical Qualitys, without which they should not be Generi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caly what they are; as well as all Vegetatives, and Sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, though they differ Specificaly one from another in their S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And wheras we Sensibly see the Moon to shine, the Question is, whether she sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And so, though it is said, that the Pike of <hi>Teneriff</hi> may be seen at the distance of two or three Degrees (as any Eminences of the Earth may be seen so farr as a Line drawn from the Summit therof will be Tangent upon the Globe of the Earth, and perhaps somwhat farther
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:61550:176"/>
by the advantage of Refraction, which may suffice to render an Object Visible about such a distance as three Degrees); yet at the first Degree it will be seen very Dull and Obtuse; and much more at the Second; and he that can see it at the third, <hi>Aut videt, aut vidisse putat,</hi> — though he look upon it at Sunrising or setting, when the Rays are most Directly Reflected, or with a Telescope, (which doth Magnify rather then Prolong the Reflected Rays); or though the Object be of the greatest Magnitude, as the <hi>Alps,</hi> or <hi>Apennine,</hi> or Rock of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and the like; which yet will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be seen very Lucid or Colorate, but Confused like a Cloud, or Fume; (yea, though it be Specular) at so great a distance: wheras plainly we see the <hi>Moon walking in Brightnes,</hi> as it is said of her, with our naked Ey, yea, her very F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nor is it only by Reflection of the Solar Rays from the Moon herself, though that be neerer to the Truth, being only by a single Reflection, wheras the other must be double, first from the Earth to the Moon, and then from the Moon back again to us on the Earth; wherefore to find out the Mystery of so clear a <hi>Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> we must consyder the Moon in her own Native Light, which is so great in herself, that thereby she is also Visible unto us, in an Eclips, in her whole Disk, and that part of her Disk, which is not Illustrated by the Sun, is Visible sometimes, or with some advantages: and wheras this Visibility is imputed to the Secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary Light of the Sun, I have shewed that an Object cannot be so farr seen by his Principal Light Reflected, and much less by any Secondary Light. Wherefore certeinly she hath some Light in herself, and such as is farr greater then the common Light of Aether; becaus she may be so seen thereby in the Aether; and yet this Light is farr less Lucid or Visible then when and where she is Illustrated by the Principal Solar Light: which to explain, we must consyder, that she also is Aethereal and Connatural with the Sun; and so was made one of those Lumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rys, which were Created in the Firmament of Heaven, and sett there to give Light upon the Earth, not only generaly, as all the rest of the vulgar Starrs, but more specia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

as well as particularly of the Sun, to rule the Day, and of the Moon to rule the Night: and thus they were made one general Constellation, or Host of Heaven, wherof the Sun, who was made to rule the Day (which is called Light, and in respect wherof the Night and all the Nocturnal L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And thus, as I have observed, Univocal Generators do most Effectualy Generate and produce, as Heat is so said to draw forth Heat; and particularly Colors, which are composed, as I said, of Lucidity and Opacity, though they be Inherent in the Colorate Bodys, wherin they are so Mist, and do Subsist; yet being so Mist with Opacity, their Lucidity is thereby also so Imprisoned or fixed and confined to the Colorate Body, that it is only Actualy Inherent therin, and cannot issue forth in Emanan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore I thus
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:61550:177"/>
conceiv, that the Native Light of the Moon, being not a Culi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, but an Aethereal Light, Inherent in the Moon itself, is like Color, yet farr more Lucid, and so farr more Evoked, Excited, and Assisted, by the Solar Light; as a White Color is thereby rendred more Visible then Black: and that the Inherent Light of the Moon, and External Light of the Sun so concurring by their more Connatural Homogeneitys, do produce and draw forth themselvs together to so great a distance, and with so great a Splendor; and though the Sun doth so produce the Inherent Light of the Moon Positively by his Principal Rays, when they are both above the <hi>Horizon,</hi> yet the Moon doth not then appear so Visible and Splendid, becaus Comparatively she is thereby made farr less Visible and Splendid then he is in himself: for certeinly this Lucidity cannot be only from Reflection of the Solar Rays, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we suppose the Moon to be Cortical, having Earth and Seas, like the Terraqueous Globe, which Sensibly doth not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect very farr; or specular, which may Reflect farther, becaus the Rays penetrate less and more Splendidly, in a fitt Position to the Ey, being Reflected thereby more equaly; but it must be also by some Inherent Light which is in the Moon itself, that is so Collustrated by the Solar Light, and by the Connatural Quality therof: nor is it to be Imagined that the highest Planets, and Starrs which are at the farthest distance, and yet Emitt such a Splendid and Vivid Light, should so shine only by the Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Solar Light. Now, though there are Spotts in the midle, and seeming <hi>Gibbi</hi> in the Circumference of the Moon, (which I rather conceiv so to appear by such Intervenient Spotts therin) yet this may not be from any Concavitys in the Body of the Moon, and the unequal Reflection of the Solar Light thereby; for there are Spotts also in the Sun, whereby his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version about his <hi>Axis</hi> is noted, and yet he shines by his own Light: but I suppose them to be only less Luminous parts, and such defects of their Native and Inherent Light, as I doubt much, whether they were so Created in this Fourth Day: and though Earth which is a Consistent Body may have such Constant Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences, and Water some Temporary Waves, yet it hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served that as Flame of a Candle, which is somwhat more Rare, is rendred Pyramidal by Compression of the Ambient Air, so if it be defended by another Intermediate Flame, as of Spirit of

And wheras <hi>Saturn</hi> is commonly represented Oval, it is said by a very curious Inspector, that indeed he appears so if you behold him through a less Telescope, but if through a larger, you may discern two litle <hi>Aetheruli</hi> on each side of him, and very neerly distant from him, which make him so to appear when they are beheld together with him Confusedly and Indistinctly. Though I shall not determine this, or how they might be Composed and Constituted by the Divine Creator: certeinly all the Planets do not Move in exact Circles, but some of them describe Circles In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented with such Hemitrochoids, as I have shewed: but it shall suffice to have proved that the Moon, and consequently the Starrs have their own Inherent Light as well as the Sun, though perhaps not Emanant without his Coll<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The Moon, as I have said, doth not Move about her own <hi>Axis,</hi> but she doth Move very notably and rapidly in her Zodiak Progressively; and, if we compute that Motion according to all her Revolutions, perhaps as fast as the Sun; which are the two swiftest Movers Progressively. And the Moon, as she is neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est to us, so probably she is least Calid and Lucid; wherefore her chief Influence is observed to be over Moisture; not that she is Moist in herself, which is a Quality of Water; but as the Sun doth by his Heat draw up Vapors, and also Desiccate or Concremate them, whereby they do not presently return again into Water, but turn into Dry Exhalations, Clouds, and Motes, wheras more Moist Vapors and Mists commonly rise when the Sun is sett, and in the colder Night; so the Moon by a more Moderate and Insensible <hi>Tepor</hi> doth draw up more gross Vapors, which presently return into Dews and Water, and chiefly when she is in her <hi>Apogaea,</hi> (as I have said formerly of Tides which are then highest) whereby the Vapors are not drawn up so high, but the Water (which, as I have observed, doth Naturaly Evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and again return to Water) by her less Heat is less Desic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and Suspended; and so the Vapors are lower, and sooner return into Water again: for though Internal Heat in the Water
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:61550:178"/>
itself, by Rarefying it, doth help Evaporation, yet any greater External Heat doth reduce the Moisture of the Vapors which it raiseth to Potentiality in Fume, which is prevented by the less Heat of the Moon; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Motive and Planetary, and every Luminary therin hath a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Specifical <hi>Compositum</hi> and Qualitys, as well as it is Generi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caly Aethereal; so I suppose these Redundances and Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scences therof, being Composed of several parts of them, have accordingly Mist Bodys, and Planetary Qualitys, whereby they perform their odd Motions, and Courses; and when this Mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orical Composition is dissolved, then they disappear and ceas. And there are not only such <hi>Maculae</hi> contiualy in Aether, which do not alway Conglobate into Comets, but very often less Comets not so much observed by us, or not on Land, as Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men say they see them at Sea: but such as are greater, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps more Concocted, are by us commonly called Blazing Starrs; which indeed are no true Starrs, but only <hi>Stellae fatuae,</hi> (as I may call them, alluding to the like Meteors in the Air, which we call <hi>Ignes fatui</hi>) and yet differing from <hi>Stellae cadentes</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, which are so called from their falling again to the Earth; being Composed of Culinary Flame; wheras Comets being Composed of Aethereal Substance, when they are Corrupted, are resolved into it again; and they differ from the true Starrs, in that they are so Composed and Dissolved only by Meteorical Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Corruption, and not by any Improper Creation, as the others: and though they also be Illustrated by the Sun, and thereby have a notable Eman<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nt Light, yet they are farr more Dull and Obtuse; so that as the Sun is the Universal Illustrator of all this Spectable World, he doth more or less Illustrate every Spectable thing, as it hath more or less of the Connatural Lucidity in it; and thus the Terreous Opacity, which is contrary to Light, doth Reflect, Refract, and Distend it, as I have formerly shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and Black, which hath most Opacity in it, doth ingage the Light in the Encounter, and more detein it thereby; Also though the Solar Rays be not Ingaged, as I said before, in the Opa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous Body, nor partly deteined, as in Reflection from the Opa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous <hi>Fundus</hi> of a Diaphanous Body, as of a Jewell, Looking-glass, or the like; but may be otherwise Reflected from any Polite Body, as a Steel <hi>Speculum,</hi> or the like; yet they are thereby Retunded, and their Reflection much abated: and the strongest and farthest Reflection, or rather Collustration is, as I said before, when the Solar Rays meet with such Lucidity, as is more Aethereal and Connatural unto themselvs: for indeed that
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:61550:183"/>
is not so properly a Reflection or Repuls, as an Influxion and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence, like a great Stream that falls into the Chanell of a less, and so both flow together. Now the Inherent Light of Comets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not only Aethereal, but Meteorical, and more Heterogeneous, the Solar Rays do not so Collustrate and Colluminate with it, as with the perfect Luminarys: and this also proves to me that there is such an Inherent Light in all the other <hi>Aetheruli</hi> themselvs, becaus the Sun doth accordingly Collustrate and Colluminate with them proportionably to their own Light in several maners and degrees; as in the Fixed Starrs, in the other Planets less, and in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets yet less; but least with the Inherent Light of Aether itself. And perhaps the Solar Rays are tinged and varied, by being so Mist with the Stellant in their Emanations, which he causeth thereby, and whereby they appear so very different: certeinly the Inherent Light of Starrs is much greater and stronger then of Comets, which the Sun partly penetrateth, as he doth a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bule of Glass; for a stronger Light Inherent doth Terminate and not Transmitt the Solar Rays, as we cannot see through a greater Flame of Light, as we may partly through a less, as through the Flame of Spirit of Wine, or the like; though any other such Light makes Objects to appear very strange and ghastly, as the Efflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Furnaces, and the like. Now the Solar Rays which are thus Transmitted, but not so freely, through the Comet, as through the Aether, by that Offence and Interruption do, as I have shewed, Converge, and so go out at the farther <hi>Vmbo</hi> more sharp and comprest, and then again dilate themselvs, which is their <hi>Cauda,</hi> in the more Rare <hi>Medium</hi> of the Aether, like Comprest Vapors which so issue out of an Aeolipile; and they are always in that part which is avers from the Sun: wheras the Moon, though she hath Spotts, which are less Luminous then her other parts, yet doth not Transmitt the Solar Rays through them; which shews even those Spotts to have more Inherent Light in them then Comets, though they may not seem to us so Lucid Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively, in respect of her other more Luminous parts. Also Comets are Globular as well as any other Luminarys, and they are not only carried about by the Aether as well as Starrs, but have their own Altitudes, and proper Courses, as they happen to be placed in the Aether in their Generative Composition, according to which they also Move by their Mist Planetary Virtue; as God first sett
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:61550:184"/>
the Starrs in their Stations and Orders, according to which they perform their Courses by their several Planetary Virtues. And thus indeed according to Statike Law, if any Body Move in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by any stronger Spiritual <hi>Potentia</hi> then the <hi>Pondus</hi> of its Body would caus it to Sink or Swim in the other, it will neither Sink nor Swim, but Move Progressively according to the Moving <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia</hi>: as a Man so swims in Water by fitly Moving his Body with a stronger <hi>Potentia</hi> then the <hi>Pondus</hi> of his Body in that <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> would caus it to Sink; and so also a Bird flys in the Air: and though I conceiv the Starrs to be Fluid as well as the <hi>Aether,</hi> and <hi>Aether</hi> as well as the other <hi>Expansum</hi> of Air, yet I also ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg, that if they were Dens and Terreous Bodys, yet some of them, as the Sun and Moon, and others, might notwithstanding so Move in the Rare Aether, by their very rapid Motions, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own several Courses, and so perhaps, not Sink in it: though otherwise, I say, that no Body whatsoever, Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netical, Planetary, or Sensitive, can Move itself without a Fulci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to keep it from sinking; which Invincibly proves that the Earth cannot so Move, unless, it being most Consistent, Dens, and Heavy, could by any Planetary Virtue in itself be so supposed to Move in the most Rare and Fluid Aether, as that it should not Sink therin, by supposing also such a rapid Motion therof Annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aly, as must be admitted according to the Zodiak, and Circle, which it is said to describe, and which according to the <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi> one way or other, must be the same with that wherin the Sun doth Realy Move; whereby that Motion will be found to be, as I said, almost fifty Miles in a Minute; and then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less we can also suppose that the Earth would sink and fall so fast through the Aether in the very first Degree of the Velocity of the Motion of Descent, which must be swifter then the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Motion, it will not so fall or sink: which to estimate more exactly I leav to the Curious. But wheras Judicial Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers pretend to foretell by the Starrs, and especialy by Comets the Fates and Fortunes of Men, yea, their very Imaginations, Affections, and Inclinations, and, which is yet more, Divine Counsels and Intentions, it is certeinly most Unchristian and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable: for Originaly God made the Starrs to be for Signes, and for Seasons, and for Days, and for Years, which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore so Emphaticaly repeated; not as Ostents or Portents, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

there could be no use in that State of Perfection, but for Signification and Indication, as well as Causation, of Seasons, Days, and Years, which were certein, constant, and orderly, when there were yet no Meteors in Earth, or Air, and much less any Changes, Confusions, and Disorders, in the Superior Natures; nor did they then portend that greatest Change, and most Dire Event that ever was, or shall be in the World, which was the fall of Angels and Men; otherwise themselvs might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily have forseen it: wherefore certeinly they were not first Created to signify any such Contingencys, but only Natural Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turitys: and now wheras they affirm, that the Starrs do by their Influences govern the Bodily Humors, and by them the Minds and Spirits of Men, let them shew us the Experiment of that, which they make to be the Foundation of their Art, and (as it is said of <hi>Thales</hi>) foretell what will be dear next year: wheras their Prognostications of any such Contingent things in their yearly Almanaks are generaly as fals as true; though I grant, as our Savior saith, that such who are weatherwise may proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly foretell what shall so ensue the next Day, or some such short time after: <hi>In the Evening ye say it will be fair weather, for the Sky is red; and in the Morning it will be foul weather to day, for the Sky is red and lowring.</hi> Thus also they represent Eclipses as very Prodigious things, which yet they know are most Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, otherwise they could not so foretell them; and if Man had still continued in Paradise, they must naturaly have been; yea, it were the greater Monster and Prodigy, if they should not so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly happen.

And now I shall return again to such Materialists, who though they cannot af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that becaus a whole Body is Moved up or down, this way or that way, therefore it ceaseth to be the same, yet can suppose, that if the parts in the Body be Moved in such a maner, as neither they nor we can discern them, there being a new Corporeal Texture, Schematism, and Mechanism therof, it shall therfore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a new Individual Spirit and Spiritual Qualitys, by such Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Motion, as it doth by Physical Generation and Corruption; which may be best Experimented in the vast Body of Aether, wherin there are also so many Orbs continualy Moving so many several ways, and yet they do not therefore ceas to be the same Aether, and the same Orbs, that they were before: and so will any other <hi>Compositum</hi> be the same, though the Parts in it Move this way, or that way, or any way whatsoever, unless there be a new Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to alter it; otherwise only the Figure and Situation of the Parts in the Whole will be altered, but not the Physical Nature of the Whole, or Parts: and so though their <hi>Hypothesis</hi> be of less Corpuscles, and not of such great Bodys, (which, as they propound the others, becaus they are Indiscernible, so I propound these, becaus they are more discernible) for the reason will be the same

in these Elementary Natures, though the Parts be never so mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute; as every part of Water is Water, though it be never so small, and though it be Moved any way whatsoever: and so sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Parts of any one Orb to Move in the Orb, as all the Orbs do in the Aether, they will no more alter the Orb, then the Orbs do the Aether: and if Matter and Motion cannot thus make or alter Elementary Natures, which are Inferior, much less any others that are Superior: and I suppose, that the Superaether is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Immovable, both in the Whole, and in all the Parts therof. Wherefore, since this and all the other Heavens are so Stupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous, (that as some suppose, they are therefore so Named) let us not conceiv, that we, or any Angel, could Mechanicaly form those Glorious Bodys by any the most curious Artifice, and much less by our own Imaginations: but acknowledg the Divine Creation, and Original Institution of Aether, and all the Luminarys therin, which have been from this Begining therof, and so shall continue and persevere untill the dissolution of this present Elementary World, Ingenerable and Incorruptible in the Whole, though not in all the Parts therof.</p>

For as the Matter is so Divisible, that it is as it were alway Divisible, and every Part and Particle therof will still be the same Homogeneous-Matter in all respects; so Elementary Spirits, which do Immediately Consubstantiate it; are therefore most Material, or United to it, and Coextended with it, and if they be so Divided with it, yet, as I have said, every Part and Particle of Earth will be Earth, and of Water Water, and so of the rest ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neraly; though in some respects, as I observed of Terreous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence, there may be a difference between Majority and Minority of their Bodys: and Vegetatives, though every least Part or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of their Organical Bodys be not a sufficient Domicil and Officine for their Spirits, becaus they are Organical; yet the Branch or Twig of many Trees being sett, will Radicate and Grow, reteining therin a sufficient Portion of their Divisible Spirit to erect a new Oeconomy, and form itself into another Individual Tree, as well as the Root and Stem: but if Sensitives be so Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, whereby the Principal Parts therof, as the Head, Heart, or the like, have their Organism destroied, they cannot Live; and any other Part Divided from them will not Live long; as an Eel cut in pieces: and yet as Fishes are of the lowest Kind of Sensitives, so generaly after such Dissection they Live longest: I have seen a Tench slitt and Exenterated to leap in the Pan where it was fried; and Fowls will not Live so long as they, nor Beasts as Fowls, as a Chicken after the Head is wrung off Moves itself
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:61550:188"/>
both longer and stronger then a Beast Decollated, which shews the more Indivisibility of their Spirits. But, as I said, the grand difference between Sensitive and any Inferior Spirits is their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and Appetite: for so, though Elementary and Vegetative Spirits also Move their Bodys, yet only Sensitives Move them with Apprehension and Spontaneity, this way, and that way, and every way, as they pleas; and so, though their Motive Powers may not be so strong, yet they are Living, and more Spiritual: and thus they Feed, and Generate, and Act all their Sensitive Operations Sensitively; otherwise they should not be Sensitives. Yet according to the Degrees of Sensitives in their own <hi>Classis,</hi> so also is their Locomotion: and thus Fishes, which are the very lowest Kind therof, are Originaly termed Reptiles; as their Swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is indeed a kind of Creeping, or Sliding: and so an Eel swims in Water as a Snake Creeps on Land; and though other Fishes in Swiming shoot forth Directly, and make no Curv Lines, yet they only Slide in a more Direct maner; and their Bodys are of a Direct and Oblong Figure for that purpose, being born up, and partly carried, upon an Equidens Fulciment of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but there are also Testaceous Fishes, which are Gradient, having Claws and Legs for that purpose, like Beasts; and if they Swim, it is also like the Swiming of Beasts: yet that Motion is another kind of Creeping; and they are more Tardigradous, and Multipedous, as generaly more Infirm Bodys are, which need so many Fulciments: and Shelfishes which have no Claws nor Legs, as Oisters, Muscles, and the like, are most Infirm, and, as I suppose, Imperfect <hi>Animals:</hi> but they are no <hi>Plantanimals,</hi> as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers term them; for plainly they are Sensitive; and therefore of the Sensitive <hi>Classis,</hi> and so to be Denominated; which appears by their Flesh, and by opening and shutting their shells accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly as they Sensitively Affect or Disaffect any thing, and many other such Indications of Sens: and though they Continue in their places, yet they are not Rooted in them, nor do Cohere therun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, like Vegetatives; becaus all Sensitives, as I said, are less Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Elementary Matter, both Internaly, and Externaly, then Vegetatives: and that which is called the Sensitive Plant, is not properly and truly Sensitive, but only fansied to be such, as I said of the Piony: and so the Oatbeard, Marigold, <hi>Heliotropium,</hi> and the like, may as well be said to be Sensitive: wheras clearly their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:61550:189"/>
are without any Perception or Appetite, and only by Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Rarefaction and Condensation of their Bodys, or by some kind of Vegetative Expansion and Compression, as I shall shew afterward. As Fishes are expressly said to be produced out of the Waters wherin their Spirits were before latent, so they require a Body Aqueous, wherin they Reside and Operate; and they were accordingly formed of the Water, as it was then Mist with the other Elements, and thereby prepared for such produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and formations: and though some may wonder, as I have formerly, at this strange formation of the Bodys of Fishes, how their Flesh, and Bones, which are Firm and Consistent, (though not so much as of Fowls, and Beasts,) should be made of Fluid Water, which could not be Transmuted into Earth, since there is no such Transpeciation, as I have before proved; yet heer al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so we may see how these Mysterys of Scripture and Nature do Consist and Correspond together: for so it is found by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that some Trees, and Fruits, as Willows, Pumpions, and the like, may be as much Augmented thereby: and so the whole Sensitive Body is still formed of Bloud: for every <hi>Mistum</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth all the Elements, and their Virtues; and there is in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or Bloud, also sufficient Matter (and so drink, if not so Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritive, yet may be as Augmentative as Meat; as appears in such who drink much, and eat litle) and Sensitive Bodys, as of Tad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pols, may be formed of Water, and if we consyder the Mistion of all the fower Elements, and the Doctrine of Potentialitys (which I have before deduced from the <hi>Chaos</hi> of all these Potentialitys) and already approved by many other Instances, (as also it may be clearly confirmed heerby) we may understand how, as I have said, it is indeed the <hi>Clavis</hi> of all Generation and Corruption: for thus all the Terraqueous <hi>Composita</hi> are Terraqueous, having also some Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, though less, of Air, and Aether, in them; and so in their Generation or Corruption, if the Terreous Qualitys be Actuated, they appear to be, and so indeed Actualy are, Terreous Bodys, and have a proportionable Firmnes or Consistence, which, as I said, is a Terreous Quality; as Smoak is turned into Soot, and the like: and if the Aqueous Qualitys be Actuated, and the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous reduced to their Potentiality, then the same Bodys will be no longer Firm and Consistent Actualy, but Fluid; as in Fusion and Corrosion of Metalls, whereby it is said, that even Gold it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:61550:189"/>
may be reduced to an Oil, or to some such Aqueous Body, and others affirm the like of any Terreous Bodys whatsoever: and so though Aereous Qualitys, according to the less Misture of that Element in Terraqueous Bodys, are not so easily and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly Actuated, yet thereby, or by Vapor, or both, Camphire, and Salts, may be Volatilised; (as Meteors may be in the Air, like <hi>Amurca,</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Mudder, standing in the top of Water): yea, by Actuating the Aethereous Qualitys therin, the Terraqueous Body may seem to be all Fire; as Iron Candent, Pitch, Wax, Tallow, Oil, Spirit of Wine, and the like, Inflamed. But the Bodys of Fishes are not so Terreous as to Sink to the bottom, nor so Aere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as to Swim and float above the Water, being most fitly poised, and prepared for their Moving in their Native Element, Water. As the Spirits of Fishes are Sensitive, so the more Perfect have all Senses, except Hearing, which some deny, and also that they have any Auditory Nervs: certeinly they do not hear themselvs, becaus they are generaly M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>te; and yet I rather conceiv that they have also the Sens of Hearing, becaus they have the more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Sens of Seing, though perhaps their Hearing may be very Dull, as their Element of Water is no very fitt <hi>Medium</hi> of Sound. Yet Oisters, and such Imperfect Fishes, have neither of these Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical Senses, Seing, or Hearing; but only Feeling, and Tasting, and perhaps Smelling, which, as I have said, is Concomitant and Assistant to Tast; though the distinct Organs of any Sens are not discernible in them, nor any Brain or Heart, but they seem to be one Lump, with something like a Bloud in it, which all Sensitives have, and also, as I suppose, something Analogous to the Organs in more perfect <hi>Animals,</hi> of such Senses as they have; and so of Imagination, and Appetite, which are the common Sensitive Fountains of all the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and wherin they Subsist, (though they have no Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Ingeny) as I shall shew afterward, and therefore no Sensitive can be without them, and consequently not without some apt Organs therof. And heer I must observ, that as every Specifical Nature is most excellent in its own Specifical Difference, becaus it is the very Specifical Difference therof; so in the same <hi>Clas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi> the lower <hi>Species</hi> may have some Inferior Qualitys more Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, or at least more Vehement and Notorious then the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior. Thus Fishes are generaly more Voracious, and less Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinary, then other Sensitives, and Augment vastly, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:61550:190"/>
abundantly, especialy such as Generate by Ejection and Superinjection of their Seeds, and not by Copulation, as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of Whales; and their Fecundity is expressly mentioned in the Text, that the Waters brought them forth abundantly, and so again Emphaticaly repeated: and therefore I do not conceiv, as some, that this Difference happened by the Deluge, which indeed did not concern Fishes, becaus it is so intimated in their very Creation. But in all these and many other Piscine Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys and Facultys the Whale, and such other grand <hi>Animals</hi> of the Sea, do excell; and such <hi>Thynni, Balaenae,</hi> and <hi>immania Cete,</hi> are therefore called Sea-monsters, not becaus they are Anomalous, but from their vast and terrible Greatnes; and the chief of them, which is supposed to be the Whale, is termed <hi>Leviathan,</hi> whom God himself hath largely described elsewhere, and saith of him, <hi>Vpon all the Earth there is not his like, he is King over all the children of Pride,</hi> I suppose, in respect of his great Bulk and Strength gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raly; though his strength in proportion to his Bulk be not so great as of many Terrestrial <hi>Animals,</hi> especialy the Elephant, which is also termed <hi>Behemoth,</hi> and who in that respect is said to be <hi>Chief of the ways of God.</hi> But Fowls are of the least Bodily Magnitude, though their Spirits be of an higher Kind then Fishes, and yet more allied to them then to Beasts, and therefore made in the same Day with them; and so it is also observed that their Brains are more Conformable to the Brains of Fishes, and the Brains of Beasts to the Brain of Man. The Bodys of Fowls are less, becaus the Air in which they were made to fly, is a more Rare and weaker Fulciment then Water, though otherwise their flying is Analogous to Swiming, and such a kind of Sliding or Creeping, and their Wings and the Motion therof to Fins and the Motion therof: and as they were not produced out of the Air, nor their Bodys formed of it, (for, as I said, all <hi>Animals</hi> as well as Vegetatives are Terraqueous) so neither of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as Fishes; for it is not so said of them, but as it is Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naly, Let Fowls fly in the Firmament of Heaven: and the other words following, <hi>and every winged Fowl after his Kind</hi> seem ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to refer to Gods Creation of them both in that Day, then particularly to their Creation out of the Waters: and it is said afterward of them, as well as of Beasts, <hi>And out of the Ground God formed every Beast of the Earth, and every Fowl of the Air:</hi> but wheras
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:61550:190"/>
plainly it is said that Fishes were produced out of Water, and Beasts out of the Earth, and neither is so before particularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed of Fowls; I suppose they were made of some more equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mist Terraqueous Substance, wherin neither Water did so much Predominate, as in the Bodys of Fishes, nor Earth, as in the Bodys of Beasts: and accordingly the Bodys of Fowls are of a midle Substance, not so Tender as of Fishes, nor yet so Fi m and Solid as of Beasts. But Fowls, though they be generaly Oviparous as well as Fishes, yet also Procreate by Copulation, and not by Exclusion of the Seed Immediately, as Vegetatives, and as Fishes generaly are Procreated; nor yet by Gestation in the Womb untill there be a Formation of the <hi>Foetus,</hi> as Beasts; which is a more perfect Birth, and proper to Superior <hi>Animals.</hi> Certeinly they excell Fishes in their Spiritual Facultys of Sens, and Imagination, as in their Singing, Nidification, and the like; as they are Inferior to Beasts in Imaginative Ingeny, and Act generaly. And wheras there are some flying Fishes, as they are commonly called, so indeed they are not Fowls, but Fishes, which generaly live in the Water, as others, and only fly above it so long as their Wings are wett, which maketh them to be more stiff and strong, as Sails are stifned by wetting: and so Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fowls are not Fishes, but Fowls, that generaly fly in the Air, though they can also dive in the Water, and continue there so long as their Breath lasteth, as we say; and so Otters, and the like <hi>Amphibia,</hi> are Beasts, and no Fishes: and though there be Aquatical Insects, which afterward prove Flys, yet this is no Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speciation, but the Worm, both in Earth, and Water, is only the <hi>Embryo,</hi> or Inception, of such flying Insects, as the Vegetative <hi>Embryo</hi> is of a Sensitive <hi>Animal.</hi>

Having thus premised and stated the <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> I come now unto the grand Difficulty, how all Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Operations are, or can be, so curiously and wonderfully effected by the Spirits Elementary, Vegetative, and Sensitive. And first, as I formerly said, I conceiv that there is a proper Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Mistion, which is Subordinate to every Vegetative Spirit, as well as a proper Vegetative Spirit, which is Subordinate to every Sensitive Spirit; and in this Mistion we commonly take notice of two Elementary Qualitys, which are indeed most notable, that is Heat, and Moisture, and which we do therefore Eminently call In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, Vital, and Radical; but certeinly we cannot conceiv that the Heat is without any allay of Cold, or the Moisture of Dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; for then they should be so Vehement and Excessive, that they should not be Vital and Radical, but Mortal and Final: wherefore there must be such a Temperament of all these fower Qualitys, and consequently a Mistion of the fower Elements, and Elementary Spirits, wherin they do Subsist; and as these fower Qualitys are susceptible of More and Less, and thereby of many va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Degrees, so according to the Arithmetical Rule of Changes the various Mistions therof, besides other Simple Elementary Qualitys, may be Innumerable unto us.

And this proper Mistion is not only the <hi>Crasis,</hi> but also the <hi>Crisis</hi> of the Life of the <hi>Animal</hi>: for as it is Subordinate to the Vegetative Spirit, it is Oeconomical, and such as doth according to the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal

Rectitude and Temper therof Naturaly Increas to an <hi>Acme,</hi> and from thence Decreas again to a Period; unless it be Violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly disturbed or altered; which is the true caus of all Diseases (which we therefore call Distempers) but if there be no such Violence offered unto it, then the Sensitive <hi>Animal</hi> doth continue from the Birth untill the Death, or Dissolution therof, (like a Lamp which goes out only for want of Oil) in sound and perfect Health, yet with such Degrees and Variations from one Stage therof unto another, as I have formerly shewed: and though ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the State of this Original Temperament the Thread of one <hi>Animals</hi> Life, as we call it, may be stronger or longer then of another, yet I conceiv it is always according to this first Vital or Radical Mistion or Temperament, in which the Constitution of every Sensitive Body is founded; and though Augment and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement, as well as Nutrition, be of the Vegetative Spirit, yet it is also by this Elementary Mistion, which that doth Subordinate to itself, but cannot alter any Primigeneous Error therin, which is Naturaly in it, though both Nature and Art may Cure Violent Accidents; and though Nature doth of herself always intend the Best, as she did obtein it in this first Creation, when all things were made Good and Perfect, yet being now blasted, there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way some Error, more or less, appearing therin; and especialy since the Floud, wherin the <hi>Secula</hi> were Abbreviated Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily by a farther Curs and Punishment of Sin: and yet also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, there were Natural Bounds sett by God in the very Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Generation itself, as well as he hath sett Bounds to the Matter and Body of the World. Now, wheras I say, that in Generation this proper Elementary Mistion and the Temperament therof is Governed by the Vegetative Spirit, I do not intend there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the Vegetative Spirit is first produced; for as in the first Creation, so still the Elementary Spirits are before the Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative; but I say that the Vegetative Spirit, which then begins to be produced, doth by and with the proper Mistion of the Elementary Spirits so begin to Operate and Contemper them; and is, as I conceiv, that Operator or Motor therin, which is called <hi>Punctus saliens,</hi> and the Architect of the Body, and which being also Oeconomical and Periodical in itself, doth according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Govern the proper Mistion as Subordinate to itself. And wheras not only Elementary, but also in and with them Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:61550:193"/>
and Sensitive Spirits, are Confounded and Coagulated in their <hi>Chaos,</hi> without any Actual Oeconomy, or Individual <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positum,</hi> all the Potential Principles therof are collected in the Seed, and prepared by the Generator; not only in Herbs, and Trees, which is sensibly Evident, and acknowledged by all, but also in all Sensitive Generation of Fishes, Fowls, and Beasts, which is denied or doubted by some; wheras almost every where in Scripture, not only the <hi>Foetus</hi> of Beasts, but also Children are termed the Seed of the Man, as well as of the Woman; and so were said to have been in the Loins of the Man, as well as to be in the Womb of the Woman: nor can the Woman Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaly Generate without the Man, any more then the Man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Woman: And wheras it is Curiously observed, that no Seed appears in the Womb after Copulation, this indeed shews the way of Impregnation not to be, as hath been supposed, by the gross Matter of the Seed, appearing there as in the cold Air, but that it is more Colliquated Attracted and Imbibed, whereby the Womb is Imbued therwith, and so also with the Womans own Seed, and thereby she is Fecundated; and so is the Egg or Seed of the Hen by the Seed of the Cock; which, I conceiv, appears Sensibly by the Procreation of Fishes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Seed of the Female being Ejected is Imbued by the Milky Seed of the Male Superinjected (and so is the Seed of Man said to be powred out as Milk) and also by the Wombs of other Sensitives, which thereby become more replete, moist, and lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricous; (as the Womb of the Earth is by Rain) and so the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male is said to Conceiv the Seed of the Male: and as the Bloud is the Life, or for the Life of the Generator, as I said, so the Seed is a Decision and farther Concoction therof in the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; that is, not only of the Venal, and Arterial, but also of the Nerval Bloud; as sensibly appears by Evacuation therof, which very much affects the Brain; when <hi>Pythagoras</hi> called it <hi>Stilla Cerebri</hi>; and Castration doth Effeminate and strangely alter the Habit of the whole Body. Nor is it more difficult to conceiv how the Seed should so Imbue the Substance of the Womb In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternaly, and Impregnate it, and thereby the Egg, then how the Bloud Venal, Arterial, and perhaps also the Nerval, (as it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by the Seed) should Penetrate and Invigorate the Flesh, and other Parenchymes, and the whole Body. And heerby we may
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:61550:194"/>
understand how fallacious Sens and Experiment is, and not to be trusted alone, without the Harmonious Concurrence of Faith and Reason, even in Sensible things; for thus if we go never so litle beyond the very Sensation itself we may soon be deceived, and unless we be very accurate, our Sens may deceiv itself in the very Sensible <hi>Phaenomenon.</hi> The Sensitive Spirit, as I suppose, is not produced assoon as the Vegetative, to which the Elementary are Immediately Subordinate, and therefore untill that be produced in some Embryonical Inception, there will be only an Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Mass: but the Vegetative Spirit begining to come forth out of its <hi>Chaos,</hi> in and with the fitt Mistion which it requires and Governs, there appears something like a Life, which yet is only Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; and though the Sensitive Spirit be also then latent in the same <hi>Chaos,</hi> and be ready to issue forth assoon as the Organical Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is Completed in all the Constituent parts therof, though at first more Rudely and Embryonicaly; yet untill then, it doth not truly Live, nor Operate Sensitively with Perception and Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite; which is therefore called, <hi>The time of Life</hi>; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, as is supposed, was the Judgment of Life or Death, for striking a Woman with Child, whereby she miscarried: but, as I said before, there is first an Operation of the Vegetative Spirit and Organisation of the Body; and so not only the Vital Heat doth Move the Liquor, by Rarefying and Impelling it, but there is also the <hi>Punctus Saliens,</hi> Regulating that Motion, and the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Moved, by its Plastical Virtue; as when the Glass is heated in the Furnace, and thereby in Fusion and Motion, the Glass-man by blowing doth Effigiate it as he pleaseth, whereby he doth also Move it this way, and that way, according to his Art: and so doth the Vegetative Spirit Move that Rudimental Liquor Naturaly by its own Plastical Virtue, whereby it doth Effigiate the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which cannot be without Motion: and so the <hi>Systole</hi> and <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stole</hi> of the Heart indeed are not Elementary Motions, but Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative; for Heat, the chief Elementary Mover, doth not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, which is the Motion of the <hi>Systole</hi> of the Heart, but Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pand, which is needles therin, for the <hi>Diastole</hi> is the Natural Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pansion of the Heart itself. Also it is Regular and Reciprocal, such as scarcely any Elementary Motion is of itself: for so though the Motion of Tides be Elementary, and also partly of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and <hi>Pondus</hi> therof, in the Fall of the Water, first one way,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:61550:194"/>
and then another, as I have shewed; yet it is Regulated by the Cours of the Moon, which itself also (as all Motions of Aethereal Bodys) is indeed Regular, but not Reciprocal; and I suppose these, and such like are Critical Symptoms of Vegetative Motions; and so, as I have said, Elementary Motion of itself is of Rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and Condensation, and not of Expansion and Contraction, wheras there is a Contraction of the Heart in the <hi>Systole</hi>; though, as before, I conceiv the Heat of the Bloud and Elementary Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therof by Rarefaction and Impuls to be Subordinate and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient therunto, and that thereby the Puls is more Vehement, and the Bloud in the Veins Impelled; otherwise without any such Natural Instrument to rais it, (like Water by an Engine) as I have shewed, I do not well see how it can ascend in the Veins, but rather that both Concurrent Motions are needfull and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to caus the whole Bloud in a Mans Body to Circulate about twelv times in an hour, as it doth continualy; and plainly in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise and Contention, whereby the Body and Bloud is heated, the Puls is more quick, and less when it is Chilled with Cold: (and so Moisture applied to the Heart taken out makes it to Move again). And clearly these are no Sensitive Motions, becaus we do not sens them, as we do Expulsion and Retention, which are Vegetative by Expansion and Compression, as well as Sensitive, and Spontaneous or Voluntary, and so farr we may perceiv the Operation, but we know not how the Vegetative Spirit doth Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pand or Contract by its own Specifike Power: and so the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive, yea the Intellective Spirit of Man, though it doth Perceiv whatsoever it doth itself, and how it Commandeth the Inferior Spirits, yet doth not Perceiv how they do Obey and Perform; as, though I do very well Perceiv that I do See, Hear, Move, or the like, yet I know not how these Operations are Performed in me by Vegetative, and Elementary Instrumentalitys, wherof the first and most common is Bloud, but Immediately and Principaly the Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val Bloud, or <hi>Succus.</hi> Now wheras Physicians say, that there are three sorts of Spirits, Natural, Vital, and Animal, (which I confess I do not so well understand, or that there are any such Spirituous Corpuscles in the Bloud which do Invigorate it) I conceiv rather that it hath itself, and in its own Substance, all those Qualitys which they attribute unto such Corpuscles; and which I shall so call Animal Spirits, or Spiritual Qualitys, very
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:61550:195"/>
Pure and Powerfull, and the most Refined of any thing that is Elementary; and I suppose that they are so Prepared by the Vegetative Spirit, and are the most Immediate Instruments of the Sensitive Soul in all its Sensations; and so, as the Stoiks say, <hi>Vincula Animae &amp; Corporis,</hi> whereby there is such mutual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation between them: for certeinly by their Instrumentality we See, Hear, Imagin, Affect, and Move the Body Sensitively with Perception and Appetite: and so we find that the Brain, wherin they chiefly Reside, works, and grows hott, and that they are Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted, and must be at least every Night Recruited by Sleep; wherefore since plainly there are such Animal Spirits, or Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Qualitys, Subsisting in the Nerval Bloud, or <hi>Succus,</hi> I will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to inquire farther into them. And, as I said, this Nerval Bloud, which hath passed through the Heart, and was there once before Refined and Subtilised, doth ascend into the Brain, and there is again Refined and Purified by the Concoctive Faculty of the Vegetative Spirit in another maner, and for other uses and purposes: wherefore the Brain is not so Calid, nor Motive, but more Cool, Moist, and Moderate, wherin the Vegetative Spirit doth Temper this Arterial Bloud, Percolating it through the Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>androus Passages therof, and so Qualifying, and Concocting it, and producing the Animal Spirits, or Qualitys therin, for the service of the Sensitive Soul; as it doth Temper and Digest the other Bloud, for Nutrition, and Augmentation of the Sensitive Body, and for Generation, and other such Inferior and Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Uses: and from the Brain, as the Fountain, this Nerval <hi>Succus</hi> is diffused into the <hi>Spina,</hi> and Nervs, as the Streams: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indeed of a wonderfull Purity, and Vigor, whereby it hath not only Potentialy the <hi>Species</hi> of Sensibles (as Extension hath all Figures in itself Potentialy) which the Sensitive Spirit can call forth and Elicit; but also a very great Strength, which the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Spirit likewise Governs, like a well managed Hors, how and when it pleaseth. And certeinly these are the most Spiritual Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, Powers, and Virtues, of Elementary Spirits, and the most Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile and Sudden Artifices of Vegetative Spirits, and most like to Sensitive and Intellective Notions and Motions: and therefore the Immediate and most apt Instruments of those higher Spirits, and of their Operations; and which plainly discover the Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation between Superior and Inferior Spirits, as I shall shew heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:61550:195"/>
And though I doubt, that heerin I may seem Novell and Curious, yet I shall shew how farr I satisfy my self concerning them, wherof I do thus conceiv; that this Nerval Bloud, or <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> is, as I said, a most Refined Elementary Substance, prepared by the Vegetative Spirit for these Uses and Services of the Sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Spirit; and that as in the fower Elements, and their Mistion, there are Potentialy all Sensible Qualitys, which are variously Actuated therin, and many of them very Momentaneously, as Light, Colors, Sounds, and the like, and so also Magnetike Virtue, and such other more Subtile and Pure Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

from the Glass, when the Man goeth his way and departeth from the <hi>Speculum,</hi> do no longer continue in his Ey, or Optike Nervs; for it was the <hi>Species</hi> of the Colorate <hi>Superfi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now certeinly the Imagination cannot so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Internaly without some Internal <hi>Species,</hi> as the Ey cannot see External Objects without such an such an External <hi>Species:</hi> and this Internal <hi>Species</hi> is not any such Image of the External, as that which appears in the <hi>Speculum</hi> by Reflection is of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect <hi>Species,</hi> but another thing Separate from it, when the Object, and all the Emanant and Reflected <hi>Species</hi> therof Subsisting in it, are absent and wholy removed; and of another Nature farr dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the former; and more spiritual and Phanstatical, and Transient as Thought; nor can it Subsist in the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion itself, which is a Sensitive Spirit; becaus this is the <hi>Species</hi> of some Sensible Quality, which is Elementary; and so are all the <hi>Species</hi> therof, whether External, or Internal; nor is it so Actuated and produced as they, by any such External Irradia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as Color, or by any such Motion as Sound, and the like; but only at the Command of the Imagination, which being a Faculty of the Sensitive Spirit, and such Contemplation of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Sensibles by these Internal <hi>Species</hi> not being performed without them, nor by any Intrinsecal and Specifike Power of the Imagination alone: therefore it must be, as I conceiv, by the Mediation of the Vegetative Spirit, which first prepares this Elementary Substance, or <hi>Succus,</hi> wherin they Subsist Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentialy, and when the Imagination calls for them, doth Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and produce them; and so when the Imagination doth Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madvert, it doth Irradiate them by its own Light, as I may so term it, which is yet more Spiritual, and Sensitive; and thereby
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:61550:196"/>
doth so Contemplate all Sensibles in such litle Types and Images (wherin they are Pictured in Small) and so very Subtile and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, which is indeed very admirable: and so also is Sensation by the External <hi>Species,</hi> which in the Ey and Optike Nervs are very strangely Contracted and Subtilised, as I shall shew heerafter. And now proceed from these Spiritual <hi>Species,</hi> which are the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of Imagination or Speculation, to consyder those Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual <hi>Potestates,</hi> which are the Instruments of Appetite, and Spontaneous Motions; and these also may be in the same Nervs, and Nervous <hi>Succus,</hi> together with the others, for so all the Nervs are generaly Tactive as well as Motive; and this suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently convinceth me that they are neither of them any such litle Corporeitys, as is supposed, which cannot probably be together in such litle Cavitys without disturbing and disordering one another; wheras clearly such Spiritual Qualitys may so Subsist together in the same place and not to be Confounded, or Mist (as two Lights) and so though they be Heterogeneous and of different Natures; as Light and Heat (which heerin are somwhat Analogous to these two Spiritual Qualitys in the Nervs; that is, the Perceptive are as Light, and the Motive as Hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>) yet they may well consist to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And as the <hi>Species,</hi> which are the Instruments of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception are, as I said, of an Elementary Nature, so more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly are the Motive Spirits, which are sensibly excited by Heat, and dejected by Cold, though they be both in themselvs farr more Spiritual and Aethereal then these common Culinary Qualitys of Light and Heat; for, as I have said, these Motive Spirits are such and so prepared, that they Move not at all; but are in their Potentiality as the others, untill the Appetitive Faculty of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Spirit Command them; and then the Vegetative Spirit, which by its Plastical Virtue did prepare them for this purpose, doth Immediately Actuate and produce them; and so they, like Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder Incensed, suddenly and strongly Move the Body; and yet no more or any other parts therof, nor in any other maner, then according to the <hi>Imperium</hi> of the Sensitive Spirit, and the Specifike Power therof; which is the first Mover itself; and doth so Move them, as the Imagination doth Contemplate the <hi>Species</hi> Actuated and produced by the Vegetative Spirit; though the Motion of the Body be Immediately by the Vegetative Spirit, and Motive Animal Spirits themselvs; as the Immediate Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:61550:197"/>
is by the <hi>Species:</hi> and so I conceiv that the Sensitive Appetite also Moveth these Motive Spirits, not as a Coachman doth Exhort his Horses only with his Voice, but as he Governeth them with the Reins, whereby he guideth the Coach, and causeth it to go this way, or that way as he pleaseth, though it be Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately drawn and Moved by the Horses, as the Body is by the Vegetative and Animal Spirits: and this is the Gubernation that I intend, whereby the Superior Spirits thus Govern the Inferior, that is, not only by a bare <hi>Imperium</hi> or Command, but a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Superior Motion, which I call, <hi>Gubernatio,</hi> or Guiding, respectively according to the several Natures of the Motions; but alway according to its own Nature, and the Specifike Powers therof, that is, Spiritualy, and Sensitively with Perception and Appetite, and not without them. Thus when the Sensitive Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit would Imagin, it Commandeth that such Internal <hi>Species</hi> be Actuated and Produced, which it also, as it were, dictateth and calleth for what it would have, and itself also Irradiateth and Contemplateth them; and though, as I have shewed, they are indeed of an Elementary Nature, Prepared, Actuated, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, by the Vegetative Spirit, yet the Performance is so Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentaneous, that we are apt to think, that our Imagination doth Create all its Phantasms in itself, and of itself; (as Poets are so Poeticaly termed Makers). And so when it would Move the Body it not only commandeth that the Motive Spirits be Actuated and produced, or that, as I said, the Horses be made ready, but it also by a Superior Motive Power Guideth and Governeth them so Spontaneously, that we are apt to think that our very Soul doth Move the Body Immediately by its own Impuls of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite and Will, and without any such Instrumentality of our Vegetative, or Elementary, Motive Spirits; which yet we must acknowledg, since we plainly perceiv, that if there be any defect in them, the Operations of the Soul are also defective; yea ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other very Curious Artifices and Motions of these Inferior Spirits in our own Bodys, (that is, such as be not so Immediately Subservient to the Sensitive Operations of the Imagination and Appetite) are performed without the Imagination or Appetite; as Nutrition, the Motion of the Heart, and the like; which we therefore call Involuntary, becaus therin the Vegetative and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Spirits do not Ordinarily attend the Command of the
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:61550:197"/>
Sensitive Spirit, nor are Governed thereby. Yet also, as they are such proper Inferior Spirits Subordinate unto it, and Conjunct with it in the same <hi>Compositum,</hi> so there is, as I said, and shall now shew, a very notable Combination between them; which may plainly appear by many Extraordinary Effects, and such as may strangely vary and alter them: thus, as I have formerly observed, Mirth helps Digestion, and is as it were the Nurs of Nutrition, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>the Sorrow of the World worketh Death:</hi> and these Sensitive Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions not only caus several Motions of the Bloud, and Alterations therin, but also in the very <hi>Systole</hi> and <hi>Diastole,</hi> and Palpitations of the Heart; and, which is yet more Notable, in the very Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of another <hi>Individuum:</hi> and not only the Motive Power of the Appetite, but also the Imagination itself doth strangely Operate heerin; as we commonly say, Conceit may do much; that is, concerning any thing which is Internal, either in our Mind, or Body, yea in the very <hi>Foetus,</hi> while it is in the Womb, and Nourished by the Parent, and is yet as it were some part of the <hi>Compositum</hi> therof; especialy while it is more Young and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and more capable of such Impressions; but chiefly in the very Act of Generation (which <hi>Iacob</hi> knew, or was Supernaturaly taught and assisted by the Angel, who appeared to him) for as it grows more Perfect in itself, and is neerer to Exclusion, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more Separate from the Parent, and another <hi>Compositum</hi> in itself, and more firm and strong, and so less capable of Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions by another: and thus I conceiv, that the Imagination or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite of the Father doth not Operate upon the <hi>Foetus</hi> in the Womb of the Mother, nor of an Hen upon an Egg Excluded, whiles she Incubates, and is hatching it. But the most wonderfull thing is, how the proper Vegetative Spirit of any Sensitive <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,</hi> by the Command or Intimation, of the Sensitive Imagination and Appetite, so Fansying and Affecting some other Vegetative thing, should Actuate and produce in the <hi>Foetus,</hi> not only Signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures therof, but also somewhat of the same Vegetative Nature: as I have been very credibly informed of a Person, whom I well knew, and have often seen the Mole on his Chin, which was said to have been caused by a Cherry thrown at his Mother, while she was Pregnant of him, in a Frolike among Ladys who were then eating Cherries; that every year in the Season when Cherry trees begin to budd, the Mole began to budd, as I may say, and

Wherof I know no other account to be given, but only this Combination and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation of the Sensitive and Vegetative Spirit: and though, as I have shewed, there is no Universal Spirit, or <hi>Anima Mundi,</hi> from which such particular Spirits may be derived and produced in any Bodys whatsoever; yet it is truly enough said, <hi>Omnia Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marum sunt plena,</hi> if it be rightly understood; that is, as in the first <hi>Chaos</hi> the Spirits were latent in their proper Elements, out of which they were produced in the Six Days, so still there are Aethereal, and Aereal, Spirits in Aether, and Air, out of which Comets, and the like Aethereal, or Aereal, Meteors may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; and so the Terraqueous Globe, or the <hi>Cortex</hi> therof, is Pregnant not only with the Elementary Spirits of Water, and Earth, but also of Vegetative and Sensitive Spirits, which while they are therin, as in their <hi>Chaos,</hi> are dispersed and diffused, and so Confounded as in a <hi>Coagulum,</hi> Inane, and Inform, that is, without any Oeconomy, or Inviduality, which is afterward Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated and acquired by Successive Generation still producing them according to the Archetypes or <hi>Protoplasta</hi> of Original Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Instituted in their first Improper Creations, as I have often mentioned: and though they cannot always attein their Regular Perfections according to the Law of Nature, yet there may be several Degrees therof to which they may arrive, and so their productions be more or less Anomalous or Monstrous, by reason of many Obstructions and Defects: wherof the greatest is the general Curs of Nature for the Sin of Man; so that now indeed, both he, and all this Spectable World, which was given unto him, and all things therin, have some Monstrosity in them; and there is now none of them exactly Perfect according to the first Instituted Law of Nature, but all are Heterocliticaly Redundant, or Deficient: and though we take less notice of others, yet some are so mishapen, that we Eminently term them Monsters; and others such Imperfect Inceptions, that we hardly discern any thing of the Specifike Nature therin: and such I conceiv this Cerasine Meteor, as I may so term it, in the Body of Man to

be; whose Cerasine Spirit, though the <hi>Compositum</hi> therof was Corrupted by Eating and Conversion into the Nutriment of the Mother, and consequently of the Child in the Womb, yet was latent in the new <hi>Compositum</hi> Generated by that Corruption; and that by the <hi>Imperium</hi> and Impression of the Mothers Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Appetite working on her proper Vegetative Spirit, and that on its own Nutriment, the Cerasine Spirit was Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caly, and very Rudely and Imperfectly produced; For thus, as I have said, the Vegetative Spirit doth Actuate and produce Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Mistion, Qualitys, and <hi>Species,</hi> as Subordinate and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient to itself, though Classicaly different; and so it may also Imperfectly produce another Vegetative Spirit, which is of the same <hi>Classis</hi> with itself, as well as one Spirit of the same <hi>Classis</hi> may, be Mist with another; and thus I conceiv, that as there apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is an Individual Oeconomy in every particular <hi>Compositum,</hi> so also a Specifical and Classical Polity, Subordination, and Combination of several Natures, especialy in the same <hi>Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum:</hi> and that thus the Sensitive Spirit by its own Specifike Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultys doth Command and Govern its own proper Vegetative Spirit, which also by its own Specifike Powers doth Serv and Obey it; and likewise Order and Govern the proper Elementary Mistion that it requireth, which accordingly doth Serv and Obey it Naturaly, with all Suavity and Facility: And thus as the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination doth more Spiritualy and Sensitively Irradiate the <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> whereby it doth Perceptively Contemplate them; so the Appetite doth also Sensitively enliven the Spirits, whereby it doth Spontaneously Guide and Govern them without any Violence or Reluctance; unless their happen some D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">III. Having thus largely discoursed of this very Curious and Mysterious way of Sensation generaly, whereby to make way for the Explication of the several Kinds of particular Sensations, I shall now also proceed to discours therof, and thereby to Confirm this general Doctrine of Sensation. The Senses are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly Five; though they all Subsist in the Imagination, which is seated in the Brain, as I shall shew heerafter, but they are rightly thus di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="369" facs="tcp:61550:199"/>
Generical; and some that only vary the Individuality, as the particular Individuality and Oeconomy of every <hi>Compositum</hi>; among which also there may be More or Less of the same Specifical Qualitys, but such as doth not vary the <hi>Species,</hi> and therefore is least of all; as <hi>Myopes</hi> do not see in such maner as others of the same <hi>Species,</hi> and yet their Sight is Specificaly the same with other mens Sight. And thus, as I have said, nothing of any one <hi>Classis</hi> doth, or can, partake of that which makes a Classical Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in others; for then they should not Classicaly Differ, nor any of one <hi>Species</hi> of the Proper Specifical Difference of another, nor any one <hi>Individuum</hi> of the Individuality of another, otherwise they should not so Differ; nor of the Differences of their Spirits and Qualitys, whereby only we can know them, otherwise we could not so know them, nor affirm them to Differ: but contrarily every <hi>Individuum</hi> doth partake of the Specifical Difference, and every <hi>Species</hi> of the Classical Difference therof; otherwise they should not be of the same <hi>Species,</hi> or <hi>Classis.</hi> And thus the Senses are more Genericaly Five, and may be more Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cificaly as many as there are several <hi>Species</hi> of Sensitives, as well as they are Individualy as many as there are several Sensitive <hi>Individua.</hi> And wheras they are so said to be Fivefold accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Fivefold several Organs, that is, their External Organs, Eys, Ears, and the like, which also the Scripture doth often mention as such, generaly and Comprehensively (as it doth deliver almost all things of Natural Philosophy in that general maner, according to the first System therof, and leav Particulars to our farther Search and Study); yet if we farther Inquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, we shall find that the Nervs, and Brain, and Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Qualitys, or Animal Spirits therin, and the Proper Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Spirit, and Virtues therof, are also Internal Organs, that is, Instruments of Sensation, as well as Eys, and Ears, and the like Corporeal Organs, which are External: and indeed the several Organs do not make the Senses several, but rather the several Senses do require such several Organs: for the Corporeal Organ of Tact is the whole Body, or all the Nervs, which are Tactive, and every Organ of the fower other Senses must have Tact or Feeling, which is the Sens of all Senses, as the Organ therof is the Organ of all their Organs; and so is the Object therof, which we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore call the fower first Qualitys (though otherwise they are
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:61550:200"/>
not first more then others, as I have shewed); and wheras the Objects of all the other Senses are Compounded of some such other first Qualitys, and probably cannot Exist without some fitt Mistion of these fower first Qualitys also, as Subordinately and Fundamentaly requisite in their Composition, though they are not Immediately Compounded therof: so likewise the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this Sens, as it is in itself, is not all, or any of these fower first Qualitys severaly, but a Mistion or Composition of them, as well as the Objects of all the other Senses are Mist and Compounded of their several Principles: for indeed any of these fower First and Simple Qualitys are too Vehement Sensibles, in themselvs which would destroy the Senses, yea and all Sensible things, and one another; and therefore, as I have said, never Exist Actualy without such a Mistion, as their Elementary Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits were so Mist in the three first Days, before which no Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative or Sensitive Nature could be produced, and so must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue as long as this present Nature, and from the Original Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration unto the Final Corruption therof. Also all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, both External, and Internal, do require the Vegetative Spirit, and Virtues therof, Plasticaly to Form them, and Temper their Elementary Qualitys, and also to Actuate and produce their Animal Spirits, as I have shewed: and this I conceiv to be the very Organism of all the Organs of Sensation, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentalitys of the Sensitive Spirit, wherin as Tact or Feeling is Ingredient, as I said, so it is in itself the Fundamental, and lest Fallible, and as it were Corporeal Sens; yet Contact of Bodys, (as it is said, that nothing can touch or be touched but only Bodys, and so indeed there must be a Contact of all Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys without any Discontinuity or Vacuity, as I have shewed) which is Corporeal, and Tact which is Spiritual, do very much differ: for so Heat by its Emanant Rays may be felt at a very great distance without Corporeal Contact, as well as Light, or Color, may be so seen; and yet it is also true, that as no other Operation, so also no Sensation can be without Contact Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real or Spiritual. Now wheras all Sensation is performed in the Brain, it is somwhat strange to conceiv how any Sensible Object, yea the most Pure and Spiritual, should arrive thither through all the Body, and the Nerval <hi>Succus,</hi> and all the Maean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous Passages therof; which certeinly is not by the Bodys

And this is evidently seen in Juglers Feats of Activity, as they are called, being so very quick and nimble, that they will throw a small black Ball out of one hand into another before your Eys, and yet you shall not see it: and so in the common Experiment of a Firestick moved swiftly round, which seems to make a Firewheel or whole Circle therof, though certeinly the Stick be only in one and the same Point in the same Instant: wherefore as the Emanation of Light and Color, though it be most swift and Momentaneous, yet is not Instantaneous; so much less the Sensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sight, which requires some time, for the <hi>Species</hi> not only to pass from the Contact to the Nerv, but also to Irradiate and Excite the Animal Spirits therin; which plainly are so Excited
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:61550:201"/>
and Actuated thereby in the Nervs, becaus when the Firestick passeth away from one Point to another, yet the Ey seeth it in that Point from which it hath passed, untill it return thither again through the whole Circle; wheras the Emanant Ray of the Light of the Fire always is, and passeth away Simultaneously, with the Inherent Light in the Body of the Firestick: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Species</hi> in the Nervs, while it is newly Irradiated and Actuated, is more strong and vivid then afterward: but the Ray being past and gone, the Vision cannot be Immediately by that, but must be by something more Immediate, which, as I suppose, can be none other then what I have assigned; that is, the Irradiating Actuacting and Evoking of the Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Also I conceiv that wheras this Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Senses, which is by Elementary upon Elementary, that is, of Sensibles upon the Animal Spirits, is by Immediate Contact of the Sensibles; and so Light enters into the Ey, and Sound into the <hi>Tympanum</hi> of the Ear, and Odors into the <hi>Nares,</hi> and Sapors into the Substance of the Spongy Tong, and the Flesh and whole Temper of the Body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is the Standard of Feeling: for
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:61550:201"/>
unless we do admitt Emanations of Cold, Moisture, and Drines also as well as of Heat, I cannot conceiv how the Object itself and the Tactive Nervs can come together, whereby there may be any Contact between them, without which certeinly there can be no Operation; for when I touch a Cold S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And it is also to be Inquired, whether in such a Body the Flesh, which is the Standard, be not mortified or benummed? and then there can be no Sensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though the Tactive, as well as the Motive Spirits, be sound and perfect in the Nervs: and the constant Temperament of the Flesh, though it be also a Misture of the fower first Qualitys, is not felt, becaus it is so Equal, and Natural, that it is also suitable to the <hi>Crasis</hi> of the Body, and likewise of the Nervs, and Tactive Spirits therin, and so doth not Offend, or any way

Affect them, whereby there should be any such Feeling therof, as when it is any way Distempered; and as we feel any Excess of Heat, Cold, Moisture, or Drines, in the Flesh itself, so if any other Tactible Object, which is External, be Unequal and Excessive in any of those Qualitys, or otherwise not in every respect of all other Sensibility such as is in the Flesh itself, it doth more or less Offend or Affect it whereby it is felt; and so the Temperament of the Flesh is the Standard, which is varied by the Univocal Generation of any such Sensible Qualitys therin, which Immediately touch upon the Nervs, and from that Contact, and Irradiation of the Animal Spirits in the Nervs, the Sensibility passeth to the Brain, where the Sensation is performed. Thus Sens, which is itself a Spiritual and Living Faculty, requireth its own more Immediate Standard, and most Refined Spiritual<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The next Sens to Feeling is Tasting; which therefore some have supposed to be only another maner of Feeling; and it is indeed by Immediate Contact between the Sapid Juice and the Tong, which hath also a <hi>Saliva,</hi> that is, the Standard therof, being in itself Indifferent to any Sapor, but when it is Infected by the Sapid Liquor doth convey it to the Gustative Nervs, whereby the Sensation is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, as I have shewed: Yet certeinly, as Sapor is a different Sensible from all or any of the fower first Qualitys (though there be some Mistion therof in the Juice, that may be felt by the Organ of Tasting, which is also Tactive, by another Sensation) so is Tast a different Sens from Tact: and though all the Body doth Feel, yet it doth not therefore Tast, but only the Tong, or Palat, and this Sensation is most Sensitively and exactly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the <hi>Cuspis</hi> of the Tong, where the Gustative Nervs meet together; as the Tactive do in the Fingers ends of a Man, or Tail of an Eel: and in the whole Tong there is as it were a Source of Moisture, keeping it alway Moist, and ready to issue forth, to temper any Dry, and convey any Actualy Moist Sapors to the Nervs: and if the Sapid Meat or Drink be not in the Mouth, but distant from it, yet the Appetite doth stirr up Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livation,

which is prepared to receiv it: whereby we may observ that Combination and Confederacy between several Natures which I have often mentioned, and which is indeed the true Sympathy, and the contrary therof the true Antipathy in Nature. The next Sens is Smelling; which also is as like to Tasting, as Odor, which is the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject therof, is like to Sapor, which is the Object of Tasting; and as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por is in the grosser Liquor, and Odor in the Vapor, so I suppose, that there is some Inodorous Vapor in the <hi>Nares,</hi> or Mammillary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses, which is the Standard of this Sens of Smelling, as the <hi>Saliva</hi> is of Tasting; though it is more Subtile, and not so Discernible: and though perhaps the very Body of Vapor may pass into the Brain, and though also Sensation be, as I said, in the Brain, yet I do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv that there is any Smelling thereby, and more then when Odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Vapors descend into the Stomach, but that this Sensation also is performed like all the rest; that is, the Odorous Vapor entring into the Tonell of the <hi>Nares,</hi> and passing thereby to the Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millary Processes, is there mett and received by some such Mammillary Vapor or Exudation, and so conveyed to the Olfactive Nervs therin, and thereby to the Brain, where the Sensation is performed, by this way only, and not by the other without it.

And so Sight hath not only its External Organs, the Eys, (which have a very quick and tender Feeling, and are very curiously composed) but also a Standard therin, as I shall now shew. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinly Sight is not by any such Intentional <hi>Species</hi> Emitted, as the Antients supposed; for the Eys, as well as the Organs of all the Fower other Senses, are made more fitt for Reception then Emis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; and the Light, which doth Irradiate the Colorate Object, doth manifestly with its Reflected Rays bring back the Actuated <hi>Species</hi> therof to the Eys, and so Intromitt them; and therefore there is no need of any such Extramission; though indeed in Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we seem to see the Object Outwardly, where it Realy is, rather then Inwardly, where it is not: which, I suppose, was the ground of that Error: wheras it is the Sens within, which doth behold the Object without, by Conjunction of both the Internal and External Lights, as I shall shew afterward. Wherefore others consydering that the External Ligh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Ey, even to the <hi>Retina,</hi> and <hi>Fundus,</hi> have perswaded themselvs that the Vision is there performed: but then we should see <hi>Visu Inverso,</hi> Backwardly, and not Forwardly, as indeed we do: and becaus the Rays do Intersect in the Ey above the <hi>Fundus,</hi> wherin they are Inverted, we should see the Image of the Object <hi>Situ Inverso,</hi> as indeed we do not. But I conceiv the true maner of Vision to be both by Intromission of the External Light, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tramission of an Internal Light, meeting therewith in the Ey, though not passing out of it; whereby the <hi>Species</hi> of the Object is doubly refined, that is, first by the External Light Irradiating it, and Abstracting from it the Colorous <hi>Species</hi> (which are not Emanant of themselvs, nor Sensible, as Emanant Heat, but must be thus first Purified and Abstracted by the External Light) and then again the Internal Light in the Ey meeting it, and being Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiated and Affected thereby, as the Standard of Sight, hath its own Potential <hi>Species,</hi> which are yet more Pure and Spiritual, Actuated in itself; as well as in the Standards of all the other Senses, as I have before shewed. And this meeting or Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of both these Lights, is, as I suppose, in or about the Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalline Humor, which Physicians rightly term, <hi>Speculum Oculi</hi>; though we do not see the Image therin Reflected from the <hi>Retina,</hi> and <hi>Fundus,</hi> where it is Inverted; for then again we should see it In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted: but we see it foreright and Direct, according to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fracted Rays of the External Light Intromitted, and Extramission of the Internal Light, there meeting with it, as I have said; as when we look through Perspicills or Spectacles: and though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in a <hi>Speculum</hi> which is Plane or Convex, as the Crystalline Humor is, we see the Reflected Image foreright and Direct, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Natural maner of Vision; yet we see it as the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject itself is, and not Inverted, as we should by such double Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, as I have shewed: and such double Reflection would too much weaken the <hi>Species,</hi> and hinder Vision. Now that there is such an Internal Light, which being Incolorous in itself, is the Standard of Sight, as I have said, is acknowledged by Physicians, who call it the Bright Spirit of the Ey, which though in a dead Ey it be extinct, and doth not appear, yet is manifest by the great difference heerin between a living and a dead Ey: and you may easily deprehend it in your own living Ey, by depres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and distorting the Vitreous Humor in the hinder part therof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving premised this <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of the most Natural and Direct way of Vision, I recommend it, as I do all others, to more Exact and farther Examination: and as I have formerly presented Optike, as a very Scientifical Study, or Philosophical Light, I shall heer transgress the bounds of a general System, in some more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Observations, and Physical Conceptions therof; becaus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I find Optike so much mistaken by others, and made a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Mathematical Science; though it be no more Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, then Astronomy; which certeinly is distinct and very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from Geometry, or Uranometry, which is only assistant and subservient unto it. So though Actinometry be assistant and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient to Optike, becaus the Rays from Point to Point pass, as I have said, in most direct Mathematical Lines, yet the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection therof at the Points, either by Refraction, or Reflection, which is properly Optical, is purely Physical and Spiritual; and not so well understood, and therefore commonly pretermitted: but though the Spiritual Nature therof be very various and may seem to be contrary; yet that is from contrary Reasons, which, if rightly understood, will be found most Regular and Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable in that very variety, and contrariety<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Light, which is not Corporeal, but Spiritual, as I have shewed, is <hi>Actus Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilis, &amp; Diaphani</hi>; and is Naturaly of itself Emanant from the Center of Inherent Light to the Circumference of the Sphere of

Emanation, which is the Sphere of its Activity; but by some contrary Opacity in the more or less <hi>Opacum,</hi> or <hi>Diaphanum,</hi> is more or less Reflected, or Refracted: Yet the Air, which is the Natural <hi>Diaphanum,</hi> and <hi>Medium</hi> of Sight, causeth very litle Refraction, and no Visible Intersection of the Rays; as I have observed of fower several Colors from fower several Walls of a Rome, crossing one another, which yet are seen in any Point of the Room severaly and distinctly, without any Visible Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>section, and Inversion, or Confusion thereby; such as appears in it afterward through Water or Glass, and the like, which are no Natural, but Artificial <hi>Media</hi> of Sight; and in both we see not by any Intersecting Rays which pass over the Ey. And though Air be much more Dens, yet perhaps not much more Opacou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> then Aether, but is as a <hi>Medium,</hi> neither Lucid, nor very Opa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous; and I suppose the Opacity that is in it, is more from the Waters above, or Vapors, then from itself, which is an <hi>Expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum</hi> as well as Aether: and it is Opacity that Refracts, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects, more then Density, as Ink doth more then other Water, or Glass, though as Dens and Heavy. Thus I conceiv the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, why the Sun, or full Moon, rising, or setting, seem so much greater, to be from the Vapors in the Airy Atmosphere (as a small Vessel at Sea, in Misty Weather, will seem as bigg as a greater Ship, in Sude Weather, at the same distance) and the Prospect of them Horizontaly through the Vapors may be as farr as a Line of Vision from them to the Ey may be tangent on the Globe of the Earth: and this also makes them seem more Red, by Local Union of their Rays of Light with the more Opacous and Dens Vapors: as if you hold Leaf Gold against the Sun, and so look through it, you shall see it Green, by the Union of its Yellow with its own Opacity and Density: but the Sun at Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and Moon at M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="380" facs="tcp:61550:205"/>
the Steeple, and more Hemisphericaly on the ground; as if we look from the bottom of a Steeple Perpendicularly to the top ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it will seem shorter, and neerer, then if we stand at a like distance from the bottom, and behold it more Hemisphericaly; which is the Natural maner of Vision, as I shall shew heerafter. Again, as the Sun at Midday may be wholy Obnubilated by a thick Cloud, and not seen at all, so he may be so partly Veiled by a more thin Cloud, that we may see his Disk, but less then when we see him in a clear Sky, with the <hi>Halo</hi> and Lustre of his Rays about him. And thus <hi>Venus,</hi> or <hi>Mercury,</hi> or other Starrs, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, or setting, may appear less; becaus their less Lights are partly so Veiled, though not wholy Obnubilated, by the very Vaporous Atmosphere: for according to the several Degrees of the Opacity and Density of the <hi>Media,</hi> and more or less Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the Objects, so they are seen greater, or less, respectively and proportionably. And thus not only External, but also In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Vapors, as in Drunken men, may Magnify Objects. But there is a very great Refraction in the Organ of the Ey, which is therefore so composed, to temper the vehement Lucidity of the Rays; and also by that Refraction, the Rays Converge, and are Contracted, in and by the Spherical Figure of the Ey, whereby the greatest Objects may be seen in small. And as there is no Visible Intersection and Inversion in the Air (as Babys in the <hi>Cornea,</hi> which are Erect Images, and not Inverted, do plainly shew) so neither in the Ey itself, after the point of Incidence in the <hi>Cornea,</hi> where the Rays are so Reflected; and also pass through it and the <hi>Foramen Vveae,</hi> into the Crystalline Humor, whereby they are Refracted, and Converge, untill after and beyond the Point of Exidence; from and out of which they Intersect, and are Inverted, as I suppose, in the Vitreous Humor: for the Aqueous Humor is as a Convexoconcave Glass in itself, whose Convexity doth caus to Converge, and Concavity to Diverge; and being Contiguous with the Crystalline <hi>Lens,</hi> they are Opticaly both as it were one Continuous Glass, or the like, with some small difference between them; that is, the Crystalline is somewhat more Opacous and Dens, and so may Refract, and caus to Converge somewhat more, and to Intersect somewhat sooner: and we may best conceiv of them both, as of a Globule, or rather <hi>Cylinder,</hi> of a Glass Vessel, whose upper part is filled with
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:61550:205"/>
Water, and lower part is solid Glass, and having the upper Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity more Convex then the neather: and I conceiv, that Rays transmitted through such a short <hi>Cylinder</hi> will not Intersect, and be Inverted, within the Body therof, but beneath, and after the Point of Excidence, in the neather Extremity therof; (and in the <hi>Cylinder</hi> itself are only proportionably Inflected and distended) as if you look through a round Glass Vessell filled with Water (and, if you pleas, also let down a <hi>Lens</hi> into it hanging by a string) and place the Flame of a Candle before it, and then apply your Ey behind it, you shall see the Image of the Flame Erect, and not Inverted; though it is true, that if you look behind the dead Oxes Ey, in the <hi>Foramen</hi> of a dark Room, you shall see the Image of the Object Inverted; becaus you look behind the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treous Humor therof, wherin I suppose the Intersection and Inversion to be; and probably in or about the Center of the Ey, which may be below the <hi>Superficies</hi> of such a Sphere, wherof the <hi>Gibbus</hi> in the <hi>Cornea</hi> is a Portion or Segment; and I conceiv, that the Irradiation and Actuation of the <hi>Species</hi> in the Internal Light, by the External, and Conjunction therwith, is before the first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tersection and Inversion of the Rays therof in the Ey; becaus we thereby see the Image of the Object Erect, and not Invert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and the Internal Light, being so Irradiated, and having its <hi>Species</hi> already Actuated in itself, by the Conjunction with the External Light, is no farther concerned therin, nor in the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>section and Inversion therof afterward in the <hi>Retina,</hi> then in the Babys in the <hi>Cornea</hi>; and that it seeth nothing behind it, or back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but only forward; which is the very Natural way of Vision; and the Immediate Vision is by its own <hi>Species</hi> so Actuated in the Internal Light, as the Standard; as in all other Sensations, as I have shewed: and as the Aqueous Humor is the Organical and Immediate <hi>Medium,</hi> for the transmission of the External Light, so is the Vitreous Humor of the Internal Light: and as we see nothing in the Air, which is the most Natural and common <hi>Medium,</hi> so neither in these Organical <hi>Media,</hi> ordinarily, and according to Nature; unless they be Violently distorted, or infected. Wherefore we do not see the Image of the Object Inverted, and Reflected from the <hi>Retina,</hi> as I have said: for if we did so, we should also see the <hi>Retina</hi> itself, and Concavity of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treous Humor; as when we see an Image in a <hi>Speculum,</hi> we also
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:61550:206"/>
see the <hi>Speculum</hi>; or on the white Paper in a dark Room, we also see the Paper, and that part of the Room. Having thus farr consydered the Natural way of Vision, I shall now proceed to consyder Refraction, and Reflection, also in order to Vision: which to explicate Visibly and Ocularly, let Experiment, therof be made by Lights of Candles set one neer to another; and first place a Convex <hi>Lens</hi> against the midst of the Candles, at such a distance as we usualy read; and apply your Ey to the <hi>Lens,</hi> as nigh as we do Spectacles to the Eys; and you shall see all the Candles standing asunder, as wide as a Line of the Page of a Book, and somwhat greater, but not altogether so clear and bright as with the open Ey, as we do thus see by reading with Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles. Of which Invention this is the use and benefit, that though they make the Letters to appear somwhat more dim, yet in reading small prints, it is recompensed with the advantage of making them them to appear conveniently great; wheras they are not so use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in beholding greater Objects, or at a farther distance: and probably <hi>Presbytae,</hi> or old men, who need Spectacles, have their Eys, or Crystalline <hi>Lentes,</hi> too much deprest, or otherwise so fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured, whereby the Intersection, and <hi>Focus</hi> of the Rays, is to farr below in the Vitreous Humor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the best Vision is neither too neer to the <hi>Focus,</hi> or Concours, where the Confusion is; nor too farr from it, where the <hi>Species</hi> are less, as I shall shew heerafter. Then if you draw back your Ey from the <hi>Lens,</hi> being held at a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient distance between the Candles and your Ey, you shall see only one Candle, and the Flame therof greater and greater, and more and more dim, untill you come to the <hi>Focus</hi>; becaus the Rays, being Refracted through the Convex <hi>Lens,</hi> do Converge to the <hi>Focus,</hi> and the Rays of the Collateral Candles first Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sect, and pass over the Ey and Crystalline Humor; and so, not meeting with the Internal Light, are not seen; but the Rays of that Candle, which is seen, being more Perpendicular, pass into the Ey and Crystalline Humor, whereby it is seen; and they alone so passing into it, and being distended by the Refraction, are Diluted and weakned, and become more dim; and also by their Distention, their Objective Base is enlarged, and the Sight of them is under a larger or greater Angle of Vision, whereby they seem greater, as I shall shew heerafter. And at, and about the <hi>Focus,</hi> where the Visible Intersection is in a very odd maner, as I
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:61550:206"/>
shall also shew heerafter, there is a Confusion of the Rays, and no distinct Image of the Flame, but only a glaring Light. And as you draw your Ey farther back from it, you shall begin to see the Image Inverted, and proportionably as great behind the <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> as before it, and so less and less, and more and more distinct, untill it begin to be Rotundated into the Spherical Light of the Rays, and so disappear and vanish away into them. Again, if laying aside the Convex <hi>Lens,</hi> you place a Concave <hi>Lens</hi> instead therof, as you did first before, and so look through it, you shall see all the Candles, but much less, and more clear and bright; becaus the Rays, passing through it, do Diverge; and therefore <hi>Myopes</hi> use such Concave Spectacles becaus their Eys, or Crystalline <hi>Lentes,</hi> are too Spherical, or otherwise so figured, as that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tersection in the Ey is too high in the Vitreous Humor, whereby the Internal Light meeting with the External, in Confusion of the Rays, or too neer unto it, the Concave Spectacles do prolong the Intersection, and make it to be lower, whereby they see more distinctly. And the more you draw back your Ey from the Concave <hi>Lens,</hi> you shall see all the Candles still less and less, from the contrary Reason of Divergence; and very clearly, becaus so many Rays of them all come together into the Ey, and so Illustrate and fortify one another. But there is no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tersection or Inversion seen by looking through any Concave <hi>Lentes</hi>; becaus there is no such Convergence, as by Convex <hi>Lentes.</hi> Thus you may also try by a Covex <hi>Lens</hi> before a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave, or Concave before a Convex, or with a Convexoconcave, Planoconvex, or Planoconcave <hi>Lens,</hi> or with Globules, or Prisms, or the like, as you pleas; whereby you shall better satisfy your self, then can be expressed in any Diagramms. And particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, you may try with the Perspective Tube, or Telescope, which was the happy Invention of all the advantages of seing at a great distance, and whereby all the disadvantages are mutualy remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that is, the Convergence of the Rays doth Magnify, and enlarge the Objective Base, according to the proportion of those few Rays, which arrive to, and meet with the Internal Light; and the Divergence therof again, before the Intersection, doth also widen the Angle of Vision, and render them more Parallel, and Direct; and as the Perpendicular Ray itself, or <hi>Axis</hi> of Vision, so all Collateral Rays, as they are more Pependicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:61550:207"/>
and less Oblique, are more Visible, strong, and clear. Again, let the Planoconvex, or Planoconcave <hi>Lentes,</hi> be lined, behind on the Plane side, with black Paper, or the like; and first place the other side of the Planoconvex <hi>Lens</hi> toward one Candle, and you shall see the Principal Image of the Flame, which pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates the Glass, less; and, as you draw back the <hi>Lens,</hi> still less and less Reflected from the <hi>Fundus,</hi> or black Paper, and Erect; though there may be also (especialy if you hold the <hi>Lens</hi> som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what Obliquely) another Image therof, Reflected only from the <hi>Superficies,</hi> and dancing about it; which will be Inverted, as I have shewed: and the Erect Image in this, or any Plane <hi>Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,</hi> though the Profundity therof be very litle, seems to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate it as much forward, as the Object is backward, or behind the Ey; for the Natural way of Vision being, as I said, foreright, we seem to see the Reflected Images of Objects behind, as if they were before, and as farr before as they are behind, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably according to the Position of the Ey between the <hi>Speculum</hi> and the Object: for we Immediately see the Image, and the Object Mediately by it: and yet as it penetrates the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanous <hi>Speculum,</hi> and is Reflected from the <hi>Fundus,</hi> we see it according to the Longitude of the Ray Reflected from the Object to the <hi>Speculum,</hi> if the Ey be neer to it, becaus we also see the Object Mediately by it. Also the penetration of the <hi>Speculum</hi> by the Ray is consyderable; for if it be too Profund, it doth not only diminish the Visible Longitude, but drown the Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and Color of the Image; as if you look into a deep Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, you shall see only a dark Shadow of your self; wheras in a more shallow Water, you may see more bright Colors of the Reflected Image; but I suppose the dark Shadow which appears in more deep Water is, becaus the Brightnes is Extinguished thereby, and the Rays which penetrate it, are drowned in it: but if the Object be Lucid, as the Flame of a Candle, or Sun, Moon, or Starr, they may appear otherwise; becaus by their great Lucidity they overcome the Opacity and Density of the deep Water. Also it is to be observed, that the Object at the Bank or <hi>Limbus</hi> of a River or <hi>Speculum</hi> is seen Inverted, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Longitude; becaus the feet, which are next to it, are seen upper, and the Head, that is farther, is seen neather; and as your Ey draweth neerer to the Object, or that to your Ey,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:61550:207"/>
so it will appear more and more Erect: but it is never seen Inverted, according to Latitude, as in a Concave <hi>Speculum,</hi> whereby the Right side shall be seen Left, and the Left Right. But if you take away the Planoconvex <hi>Lens,</hi> and instead therof place the Planoconcave <hi>Lens,</hi> so as before, you shall see the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, if you look very neer, much Magnified, by the Divergence of the Rays therof; and, as you draw it farther back, less and less. Also as before, in the very <hi>Fundus</hi> of the Concavity to which the Rays pass more Directly, and where they so penetrate the <hi>Speculum,</hi> as well as if it were Convex, or Plane, you may see one Erect Image; wheras, if the Concave <hi>Speculum</hi> be not Diaphanous, but Opacous, and only Polite, as of Steel, or the like, you shall see no such Erect Image therin; but only Inver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, so as you shall see others Reflected only from, and dancing about the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Concave <hi>Speculum</hi>; becaus they do not penetrate the <hi>Diaphanum</hi> therof, but being Reflected first from the <hi>Limbus,</hi> and back again from the sides to the Ey, are thereby Inverted, as I have shewed. And if you behold the Inverted Image in the Concave <hi>Speculum</hi> Obliquely, it may seem to come toward the Ey; becaus it doth not penetrate, and pass forward, as the Erect Image; but you shall alway see it before, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver behind, though the Object be behind you. Thus as there are Primary and Secondary Rays of Light, as I have formerly shewed, so also <hi>Species</hi> of Colors, or Images; that is, the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary <hi>Species</hi> are of Fixed Colors, which are seen Objectively, as they are, and where they are, (if there be no other Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment); and the Secondary <hi>Species</hi> are of desultory Colors, or Images, whereby the Objects are seen as they are not, and where they are not, according to the variation of the Rays, as I have shewed. But as we see no Images in the Natural <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> as Spectres in the Air; so neither in the Natural Organ of the Ey, unles it be violently distorted, as I have shewed, or be infected, as with the Jaundise, or the like, or have Motes and Suffusions in it, wherof the Erect Images do appear foreright without the Ey, becaus they penetrate the <hi>Apex</hi> of the Concave <hi>Cornea,</hi> like the Erect Image in the <hi>Fundus</hi> of a Concave <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum,</hi> as I have shewed. And now I shall proceed farther to shew the Differences between Refraction and Reflection; and how Vision is Immediately by Refraction, and only Mediately
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:61550:208"/>
by Reflection of Rays, or Images: for Refraction is more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentaly Visive, according to which we see through the Organ and <hi>Medium</hi> foreright, but Reflection is more Objective, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which we see the Object by the Reflected Image ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Forwardly, but never Backwardly, as I have said.

Confusion, by that odd Intersection of the Refracted Rays, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verging, and passing through the <hi>Lens,</hi> and then Reflected on the Paper: and as you draw the Paper farther back from the <hi>Lens,</hi> you shall begin to see a greater Image of the Flame Inverted, and so less and less, untill you see it least; and then it is most bright and vivid, by Conspissation of the Rays: wheras if you look through the <hi>Lens</hi> with your Ey a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> such distances, you shall first see the Flame Erect, and greater and greater, untill you come to that distance where it was least on the Paper; and there look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through the <hi>Lens,</hi> you shall see the glaring Light and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion; whereby it plainly appears, that Sight, which is by such looking through the Ey, forward, and not backward, is not by Intuition of the Reflected Image in the <hi>Retina,</hi> but by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect <hi>Species</hi> of the Object Refracted through the Crystalline <hi>Lens</hi>; otherwise we should see the Object least, where we see it greatest: and though the Image be Inverted in the <hi>Retina</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Intersection, yet the <hi>Species</hi> is Erect in the Crystalline Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, before it; whereby we see the Object Erect, as I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And as I have formerly observed, so it may appear by the Image Reflected on the white Paper, that the farther the Object is from the <hi>Lens</hi> before it, the neerer is the Intersection behind it, and the neerer the farther; and the more Convex the <hi>Lens</hi> is, like the Crystalline Humor, the difference is the less; and it is greatest at first, and less afterward; so that there appears no great difference in the distances of the <hi>Focus</hi> of the Sun, and Moon, through the same <hi>Lens,</hi> Reflected on a white Paper, though the distances of the Sun, and Moon, themselvs, be vastly different; and though their several <hi>Diameters</hi> also be as diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, yet there appears litle difference therof in their <hi>Foci</hi>; whence some usefull Observations may be collected, which I leav to Astronomers; and shall only Opticaly observ, that where the Object, and consequently the Intersection in the Ey, are at the fittest Distance, there is the <hi>Meta</hi> of Sight, and most distinct and clear Vision; which also varys according to the several Figures of several Eys, and neerer or farther to or from that <hi>Meta,</hi> we see less distinctly and clearly, as I shall shew afterward. Again, if you take away the Convex, and instead therof place a Concave <hi>Lens,</hi> as before, between the Candle and the Paper, you shall begin to see an Image of the Flame Inverted, but less then
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:61550:209"/>
through the Convex <hi>Lens,</hi> and not Erect, as through the Plano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concave <hi>Lens,</hi> becaus the Refracted Rays Diverge both ways through this Ambiconcave <hi>Lens,</hi> and penetrate through no such <hi>Planities,</hi> nor are Reflected from the <hi>Fundus,</hi> as in the other: and as this Inverted Image appears less and less, so where it is least, you may plainly see it environed with a <hi>Halo</hi> about it, which is by the Divergence of the Collateral Rays: and I conceiv that Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion through a Concave Glass is according to those Rays which so Diverge thereby, and not according to the litle Image Reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Paper; but I suppose, that it being Inverted and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secting farr neerer then that through the Convex Glass, the Rays therof, which are doubly Reflected to and from the <hi>Limbus,</hi> as I have shewed, and so penetrate the <hi>Fundus,</hi> which is inmost, and pass unto the Paper, where the second Reflection is, do in the Ey pass over the Crystalline <hi>Lens</hi>; and therefore we do not see thereby, and these are much weaker then the other, in their <hi>Focus,</hi> where they burn farr less through a Concave, then through a Convex <hi>Lens</hi>: and so are the Inverted Images, which dance about the <hi>Superficies</hi> more feint and weak, then the Erect, which penetrate the Profundity; becaus such Inversion is caused by double Reflection, which doth weaken, as I have said: wheras single Reflection through the <hi>Lens</hi> doth more strengthen, by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spissation of the Rays, and that also doth make the Inverted Image in the <hi>Focus</hi> Reflected on the Paper very vivid, and more bright then such as dance about the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Glass. But it is plain, that we do see through the Concave <hi>Lens</hi> only according to the Diverging Rays, becaus we do not see only the Image of one Object, as through a Convex <hi>Lens,</hi> but very many, and all Erect, and never Inverted: for Divergence doth not caus Intersection, nor Inversion. But generaly after the most bright and least Image Reflected on the Paper, either through the Concave or Convex <hi>Lens,</hi> it begins again to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed and disappear, by drawing back the Paper farther be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the <hi>Focus,</hi> and so to Rotundate itself, by returning to fill the Natural Sphere of Light, though the Flame of the Candle be Pyramidal. Also it is generaly true, that all Refraction, by passing through that contrary Opacity and Density of the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanous Body, though it doth penetrate, and partly overcome it, yet doth also so farr thereby distend and dilate and weaken the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fracted
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:61550:209"/>
Rays; and by that Union with the Opacity and Density, the <hi>Diaphanum,</hi> with the Light in it, is rendred partly Objective and Visible, and <hi>quas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> Colorous: but Reflection of Rays, which do not penetrate the <hi>Superficies,</hi> or not very farr, but are ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated thereby, and made to Converge, or Reduplicated, doth Illustrate and fortify them; and therefore no Convex burning glass can be made to burn so strongly, as a Parabolicaly Concave Steel Polite; wherin, as there is no such disadvantage by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraction, so there are the advantages both of Reduplication, and also of Concursion of the Rays to a Point. Now I shall consyder Latitude, and Longitude of Vision; which though they are also Optical, and not only Mathematical, yet they are Opticaly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable one unto another, and both with Magnitude. And I suppose that as the Light is Naturaly Spherical, and that part of the Ey, whereby we see forward, Hemispherical; so also that Sight is according to an Hemisphere, or some Segment therof; and that, as a <hi>Lens,</hi> which is the Segment of a larger Circle, though it be therefore greater Mathematicaly, yet is Opticaly no more then a proportionable Segment of a less Circle; so the Objective Base of the <hi>Pyramis Radiosa,</hi> whereby we see, being, as I said, an Hemispherical Segment, though it be of a greater Circle, and proportionably greater, or more Late, yet conteins no more Objects, then of a less Circle; becaus both are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably Circular, whether they be Quadrants, or Semiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drants, or the like, of either Circle: and as the Optical Seg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is greater or more Late, so the same Objects conteined within it are seen greater proportionably, then if they be continued within the Segment of a less Circle; but heerin the Optical differs from the Mathematical Segment of a Circle; for the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are seen greater through a more Circular <hi>Lens,</hi> if it be held neer to the Ey, as in a common Microscope, and proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably according to the Distance, and Circumference of the <hi>Lens,</hi> which must be greater and more Late, if it be held farther, as in the Telescope; becaus they are seen fewer, when fewer Rays therof pass into the Ey, and more pass over; and fewer Rays passing into the Ey always make a greater or more Late Optical Segment, and are seen as great, as more Objects together with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that Segment, when more Rays pass into the Ey. Also the Angle of Vision, as they term it, is proportionable to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:61550:210"/>
Base; for indeed it is not, nor can it be an Angle of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingence, nor any perfect Cone (as an Image can never be a Point) but a Conoid, and somwhat Late, proportionably accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Base of the <hi>Pyramis Radiosa:</hi> and so we are said to see more Objects, under a wider Mathematical Angle; but we see the same Object greater or more Late, under a more Late Optical Angle, or Conoid; according to which we see more Immediately in the Ey itself, which is the Standard of Vision, both of the Color, and also of the Latitude, and Longitude. Also the Longitude is proportionable to the Latitude Opticaly, rather then Mathematicaly; for though a larger Circle hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a longer <hi>Diameter,</hi> yet as the Optical Segment and Conoid are greater and more Late, so the <hi>Axis</hi> or <hi>Diameter</hi> is shorter; like a <hi>Lens,</hi> which as it hath a more Late <hi>Superficies,</hi> hath a less Profundity: and thus always, when we see the same Object great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, we see it neerer, and less, farther. And becaus the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral way of Vision is Hemispherical, therefore if we see Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly, as I said, that is, according to half the Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spere; as if we lay our Ey on a long Plane Table; or stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Shore, behold the Sea; or looking on the side of a Brickwall, behold the white Lines therof; our Vision is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed thereby: becaus the other Rays, which do not come to the Ey Hemisphericaly, but rise toward and press upon the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular <hi>Axis</hi> of Vision, do oppress and disturb it; and so the Object seems to rise higher, as the Sea doth to the Sight one way; and the Rays Converging together toward the <hi>Axis</hi> the other way, seem at length to meet, and terminate the Sight, as the white Lines of the Brickwall. Again in Natural Vision it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, there is an Optical proportion to be consydered, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the several Figures of several Eys, as I have said; and so the <hi>Meta</hi> of the most distinct Vision is such, as that some read best farther, and some neerer, as <hi>Myopes,</hi> who hold a Book as neer to their Ey as they may; becaus the Object be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neerer, the Intersection in the Ey is somwhat farther and lower, as I have said before: and they are thus helped by Concave Glasses, as I suppose, rather then by the litle Image which doth penetrate the <hi>Fundus</hi> therof; though I conceiv that <hi>Presbytae</hi> are helped by the like Image penetrating the Convex Glasses, which they use: but as the Convergence by the Convex
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:61550:210"/>
Glasses doth help them, whereby certeinly the Intersection is neerer and higherin their Eys; so the Divergence by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave Glasses doth help the other, whereby the Intersection in their Eys should be farther and lower; as certeinly their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Vision is very much neerer: and as in Convex Glasses, the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Rays, which Converge most, and so first Intersect, do therefore pass over the Ey, and only the Rays of the Image pass into it; so also in Concave Glasses, the inmost Rays of the Image, which only Converge, and Intersect so soon, do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pass over it: but I referr this to the consyderation of <hi>Myopes</hi> themselvs, who can better declare the Experiment ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of unto us, then we unto ourselvs, who have not their Eys. Yet I may very well suppose that according to the <hi>Meta</hi> of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, which is different in several men, according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Figures of their Eys, so the Latitude and Longitude of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects seen at the <hi>Meta</hi> is proportionable Opticaly, but not Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicaly: for probably he that sees at the neerest <hi>Meta,</hi> seeth as many Objects within the Latitude therof, and them Visibly as farr in Longitude, as he that seeth at the farthest, and so proportionably: and so as we all look beyond this <hi>Meta</hi> of the most distinct Vision, we see less distinctly; becaus the Intersection in the Ey is somwhat varied thereby; though not consyderably at any greater distance, as I have said: but I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv also, that becaus the Rays which come into the Ey being weaker as they are more distant do less affect the Sight by its own Internal Light in the Standard, therefore we see the Objects less clearly and distinctly; and if they be very Remote, and not very Lucid, we see them very confusedly; and at last not at all; that is, as farr as the V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="392" facs="tcp:61550:211"/>
greater, nor farther proportionably; but only see the Aether be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Sea, as we see Ships at Sea at a great distance, one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond another, but very neer one to another, though they be farr distant one from another. Also as the Vigor of the Rays is Finite, and therefore less as they pass farther, so is the Strength of Vision itself; and therefore if we look through an open Tube with o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e Ey, we see the same Object, being but one, more clearly and distinctly, then if we see many Objects with both our open Eys; though we see the one O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ject neither greater, nor neerer, so as we do through the Telescope. And so though Art may help Nature in one respect, yet it hinders it in another; and therefore also when we see Objects greater, and neerer, through the Telescope, we see them more dim then when we see as great, and as neer, with our open Eys: for Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is Universaly best in herself, and hath best consulted all those benefits together which she intendeth; as I have observed of the three Quantitys; that what is gained by one is lost in another; and so Madmen are stronger then others, by a sudden and greater Expens of Spirits, but weaker afterward. And such Artificial advantages of Sight are only to be made use of upon particular occasions, and not constantly; for they who use to read with Spectacles cannot well read without them; nor is it good to dilate the Sight in reading by more Light then is needfull, or to strain it in reading by less, or in too small Prints, and the like: and of all others this most Noble Sens doth soonest decay, and while we enjoy it, is most liable to Deception, as we term it (though it be rather a Natural Infirmity) becaus Color, which is the Object of Sight, is not Immediately Visible in itself, but by Light, wherof there may be so many several Refractions, and Reflections: and Sensation is Immediately by that which is Immediately produced in the Standard therof, as I have shewed: and so in feeling itself, which is least subject to Deception, yet he that is <hi>Nive perustus</hi> doth not feel the Cold of the Snow, becaus by the <hi>Antiperistasis,</hi> the Flesh of his Body, which is the Standard, is made Hott: and so the Ey seing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rays which enter into it, and not the Object itself without it, though it see that which is the Immediate Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to itself truly, yet it seeth the Object itself falsly; and so if either the Optical <hi>Axes,</hi> or Planes, be varied, we see according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:61550:211"/>
as if we look upon the same Object through several <hi>Diop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trae,</hi> or distort one of our Eys, whereby there are double Images therof in the Brain, we see it double, though it be single in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: so if we turn our Bodys round, the Object seems to turn round; or the Object may seem to be round when only the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Axes</hi> make a Circle, as in the Firewheel: and so also the round Earth seemeth Plane to us, becaus our Ey cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the vast Globosity therof while we stand upon it: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as all these Infirmities may be easily Rectified not only by Faith, and Reason, but by right Sensations: and right Sens is true as well as right Reason, or Faith; and what is true to one of them is true to them all: nor is there any Falshood in them, or Falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city in Nature, but only Infirmity, or such a Finite Perfection as it is in itself, which we may otherwise Rectify or Correct, our selvs, by the right exercise of all those Facultys, wherof God and Nature hath made us partakers, to instruct us, and not to deceiv us. Now as these five Senses have their proper Objects, and several Sensibles, as I have shewed; so there are many Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sensibles, which by them, and together with them, may be sensed; and they are such Common Sensibles, not only becaus they are so sensible by and with others, but also becaus many of them may be sensed by several Senses: as all Quantity, and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Matter, and the like; and there is indeed nothing in this Spectable or Sensible World which is not sensible one way or other: for so all other things, which cannot enjoy themselvs, were made to be enjoyed by Sensitives, who thus enjoy themselvs, and all other Sensible things; whereby also Intellective Man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth Intelligible things in this Conjunct State with his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Body, as I shall shew heerafter.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Having thus farr passed through the Insensible and almost Inextricable Labyrinth of the Sensorys, I now arrive at the Brain; where, as I said, the Sensation is performed; and which may evidently appear by what I have said, for so this is the reason why Sight by the two Eys, or Hearing by the two Ears, is not double, though the Organs be double, becaus the Sensible <hi>Species</hi> mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in the Brain, where the Sensation is performed: where also, if they do not so meet, the Sensation will be double, as in distort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of the Eys, as I said; and so if we putt one hand into cold Water, and the other into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ott, and the like: and it is
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:61550:212"/>
well known, that if a Nerv be bound in any part of the Body, there is no Sensation by it below, but only above, that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Ligature and the Brain: so also the <hi>Gutta serena,</hi> which is in the Optike Nervs, causeth Blindnes, though the Ey, which is the Organ of Sight, be sound and perfect: and in Seing we seem not to see any thing Intermediate between the Object and the Brain, but as it were by a continued Visive Line, or <hi>Radius Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus,</hi> reaching from one to the other, both through the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> and Organ. And most certeinly all the Nervs are rooted in the Brain, and <hi>Medulla</hi>; and from thence, all the Nerval <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> both in the <hi>Spina,</hi> and in all the Nervs, doth flow forth. Wherefore indeed it was an inexcusable Error in them who would derive the Nervs from the Heart; though that, as I have shewed, by its Motion be the first Operator and Refiner of the Sanguineous Liquor; which is afterward Concocted in and by the more Moderate Temper of the Brain, and there first made a Nerval <hi>Succus,</hi> and from thence diffused into the Nervs, and <hi>Spinalis Medulla.</hi> And so the Scripture, which, as I said, speaks Comprehensively, doth only mention the Heart, as the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of all Sensation and Intellection: as it doth only mention Bloud generaly, which so passeth through the Heart, and is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward distinguished into Arterial, and Nerval: and though some, (who will, as we say, correct <hi>Magnificat</hi>) may cavill and be offended, or judg this Expression to be Popular, yet they ought to consyder, that such Comprehensive Expressions are not Popular, but exactly true in their Comprehensive sens: and thus Heart in Scripture is never Contradistinguished from Brain, nor to be understood so as to Exclude, but Include it, as Bloud doth all kinds of Bloud: nor is there therefore any mention particularly of any Nerval <hi>Succus,</hi> or of any Brain, or any such thing in Scripture; becaus according to the Language therof, such general Names, as Bloud, and Heart, do Comprehend all the rest: wheras we read of Liver, Kidneys, Gall, and such other Instruments of Vegetative Nutrition, rather then of Sensation, and so of Seed and Milk, which are for Generation and Nutrition of others. Now that the fivefold Sensations of the five several Senses are performed in the Brain, as well as the Sensation of the very Imagination itself, I shall farther most plainly prove, becaus the Sensitive Facultys do all Subsist in the Imagination; as may sensibly appear by the maner of their Sensation, which is not,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:61550:212"/>
nor can it be, without Animadversion, as we rightly term it, becaus it is the Adverting or applying of the Imagination to Contemplate the Sensible <hi>Species,</hi> and also the Irradiation therof by its own Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal and Sensitive Light, which makes the Sensation otherwise; though the Object, Organ, Sensorys, and all the <hi>Apparatus</hi> therof, be ready, and never so well instructed: Seeing we See not, and Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we hear not; or we see and hear not, or hear and see not; or see or hear this, or that, Visible, or Audible Object, and not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; or one more then another, accordingly as we Intend it, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our Imagination to it, as I have shewed: and I have heard of one, who being to shoot at a Mark for a Wager, professed that he thought he neither saw Heaven, nor Earth, nor any thing besides the Mark; which most vehement Intention did very much conduce to his hitting of the Mark, and wining the Wager: and this Contemplation of the Imagination is that, as I conceiv, which we commonly call Common Sens; whereby the Imagination, which is one and the same Faculty in itself, doth thus Contemplate all the several Sensibles; as also one and the same Appetite doth Affect or Disaffect them; and one and the same Understanding understand them, and Will will, or nill them. For it is not the variety of Objects, but the several maner of Sensation, that doth distinguish the Facultys, and make them Realy to differ; and thus the Senses according to their fivefold Organs, and Sensorys, whereby their several Sensible Objects, or <hi>Species</hi> therof, are received severaly, and in a several maner, are several; but though their Objects, that is, their Proper and Common Sensibles, may be several, yet as they both are so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the same maner they do not distinguish the Sens, nor make it several in itself. Also we may heer observ the very Spiritual Nature of the Sensitive Soul, and Imaginative Faculty therof, that though the gross Sensible Objects be not only diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, but contrary one unto another, and such as will themselvs be Mist one with another, as Heat and Cold will be Contemperated into a <hi>Tepor</hi>; or otherwise there will be a great Conflict between them, when they meet together; yet the same Imaginative Faculty doth apprehend them both together (as when one hand is in cold Water, and the other in hott) distinctly, and inconfusedly. Also this sheweth the reason of that Sympathy and Consent that is between some parts more specialy, and the whole Body generaly, in Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

wherof the whole Body is capable, as I said; that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus the Imaginative Faculty is one and the same, which resideth in the Brain, from whence all the Nervs are dispersed through the Body, and therefore the whole Body is so affected; yet so as a Wound in the Toe doth not Corporealy affect the Brain, or Imagination therin, but Spiritualy; and though the feeling in the Toe that is wounded being in the Standard, doth caus a Principal Sensation therof in that Part, and so in the Brain, and from thence in the rest of the Body; yet that is only a Secondary Sensation, as I may so call it: wherof it is said, if <hi>one Member suffer all the Members suffer with it</hi>; that is only by the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native Faculty of the Sensitive Spirit therof, which is one and the same; though no other Part be Corporealy affected. And wheras I have often mentioned two such several Kinds of Sensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is, one by the outward Organs and Sensory, and by the Corporeal or Elementary Mutation made in the Standard within the Body, and Irradiation of the Elementary Animal Spirits in the Nervs, which is Primary; and the other by <hi>Species,</hi> Actuated only by the Vegetative Spirit in the Elementary Animal Spirits in the Brain itself, as I have formerly shewed, which is Seconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: wherof we call one Sens, and the other Imagination, I shall now shew the Sensible difference therof in Sleep, when all the Senses are bound up and obstructed; and yet then the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth thus operate in Dreaming; and the Senses are so bound up and obstructed by the Vaporous Bloud, which ascendeth from the Heart, through the <hi>Carotides,</hi> (whence they are so called the Sleepy Arterys) to the Brain: and it is said, that if they be stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, Sleep will presently ensue, though I rather conceiv that to be an Apoplectical, then Soporous Effect: for it is not the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing of them, and thereby hindring the Sanguineous Vapors to ascend, which causeth Sleep, but rather the contrary; that is, an ascent therof more copiously, which doth obnubilate the <hi>Basis</hi> of the Brain, and reacheth as farr as the Roots of the Nervs; and the Animal Spirits therin, which are most Pure and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and the fitt Instruments of the Sensitive Spirit, are cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by such gross and unconcocted Vapors, and thereby rendred unfitt; and so the Imagination cannot operate by them; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon that kind of Sensation ceaseth, untill those Vapors be again rectified and refined in the Brain, and so pass into the Nervs,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:61550:213"/>
and then Sleep ceaseth, and that Sensation begineth to operate thereby again. But the Imagination, being seated in the very Brain, itself, and probably in the upper Region therof, and Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brain, (which we accordingly feel to grow most hott by the working therof) the Cloud of those ascending Vapors, being there weaker; (as the Vapors are, which ascend higher in the Atmosphere) and the Concoctive Power of the Brain, there being greater, the Imagination may Contemplate the <hi>Species</hi> in the Animal Spirits, which are in the Brain itself, and there Actuated by the Vegetative Spirit, which doth concoct and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them, as I have shewed, and which is sufficient for this Secondary Operation by the Imagination, and needeth no such Irradiation by the <hi>Species</hi> of External Objects, as is required in the Primary Sensation. And so this Secondary Operation by by the Imagination, in Dreaming, is also much weaker, then it is when we are Waking; or at least farr more Wild, and Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular: either becaus those ascending Vapors are not yet so pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defecated in the upper Region of the Brain; or otherwise, becaus the Imagination then wants the Archetypes of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Sensation, whereby to rectify its own Contemplations. And it is evident that in Sleep, even the Animal Spirits of the Nervs are not so Consopited, or, as we say, in a dead Sleep, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, but that any Vehement Sensible doth soon awake them; and the Spirits by degrees are rowsed up, and the Vaporous Cloud dispersed; yea while we are asleep, as the Cloud is more or less gross in ascending, or sooner or longer in being puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the Brain, so is our Sleep greater, or less, or shorter, or longer, and sometimes the Soporous Cloud is so small, and very Rare, that we are, as we say, between Sleeping and Waking. Now that it is so, may plainly appear by the Causes of Sleep; which are either Expens of Spirits, that induceth a Lassitude, wherupon Sleep Naturaly ensueth, becaus Nature requireth a Recruit therof, and the Bloud then ascendeth more copiously to the Brain, which is the part affected, and indigent therof; or Satiety and a full Stomach, whereby the Vapors so ascend of themselvs; and Drinking commonly causeth Sleep more then Eating, becaus Drinks are more Vaporous and Spirituous then Meats; or Dejection of the Spirits by Stupidity, and Sorrow, and the like, and so Narcotike Medicines by their Stupifying
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:61550:214"/>
Quality induce Sleep; or Idlenes, and Cessation from Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of Body, or Mind, may be another Caus therof, as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveth the Impediment of Sleep, or indeed the very Contrary therof, for so all Exercise is a Waking; and therfore a man cannot well sleep if he do but stand upright<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Sleep, as I may so say, unbendeth the Bow, and relaxeth not only the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive, but also the Motive Spirits; and thus as Exercise and Lassitude, so Waking and Sleeping, do follow, and indeed mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualy caus, one another, by Expens and Recruit of the Animal Spirits, both Perceptive and Motive; which heerby appear to be very Connatural: for as <hi>much Study is a Wearines to the Flesh,</hi> as the Wise man saith, so wearines of the Flesh is also an Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment to the Study of the Mind. Now as I have shewed, that all Perceptive Sensation, both Primary and Secondary, is in the Imagination, so if any require that I should also shew what is that Specifike Imaginative Power, whereby the Sensitive Spirit so Operateth (wherof I have thus farr traced the Operations, or maner of working, from the Sensible Object to this Sensitive Faculty) as I have shewed, that the Sensitive Spirit itself is an Active Spiritual Substance Created by God in the Begining, and first produced with this and all other the Innate Qualitys therof, so Actuated by God in this Fifth Day; so I can only affirm tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> this Imaginative Power is such, becaus God so Created it; as Matter is Matter, and Spirit Spirit, Heaven Heaven, and Earth Earth, Extension Extension, Heat Heat, and the like, becaus God so Created them in the begining; and as no man can go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that Begining, so neither beyond that Creating Causali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but must necessarily at last terminate in the Wisdom and Will of the Creator therof, when he knoweth that he hath ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at any Simple Substance, or Accident, which is not Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited, or Mist with others; and this, as I have said, is the <hi>Non ultra,</hi> or utmost Bound, not only of Human, but Angelical Knowledg; and they who will inquire farther into the Caus of every Caus, and so Infinitely, like Children, shall not, nor can they, ever be Satisfied. Wherefore I say, that the Sensitive Spirit of any <hi>Animal</hi> such, as it was Created and produced in this Fifth Day, or afterward, and not being Mist with others (as the Sensitive Spirit of a Mule, which is both Equine and Asinine) is such a Simple Substance Immediately Created by God, though
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:61550:214"/>
the whole <hi>Compositum</hi> be Compounded of that and a Vegetative Spirit, and Elements, and Matter, as I have shewed: and this is, as I conceiv, the proper Work of a Philosopher, thus, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the Works of Improper Creation, that is the Mistion of Elements, Actuation of Qualitys, Composition of Matter, Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary, Vegetative, and Sensitive Natures, and the like; and so like a Speculative Chymist, to Separate those things in their several Natures by his Intellect, which they can never do in fact by all their Instruments, and that it is a very Improper Work for him to inquire farther then the Work of Proper Creation, which he ought wholy to resolv into the first Caus of all Causes, that is, God, who <hi>hath made all things for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> and <hi>according to the good pleasure of his Will.</hi> And so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so I say, that as God made the Sensitive Soul to be a Living Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive Spirit, accordingly he Imprinted in it certein Simple In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Notions, whereby it might so Perceiv in a Living maner, by, and with the Instrumentality of the Vegetative and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Animal Spirits and <hi>Species</hi> and a Conjunction between them and the Sensitive Animal Irradiation. Thus Generical Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, Feeling, and the like Sensitive Notions, wherwith all Sensitive Spirits are instructed (and not Vegetatives, Elements, or Matter), are the Innate Facultys, whereby Sensitive Spirits do Imagin, feel, and the like; and not the others: and this is, as I said, a double or Reflex Operation, wherof no Inferior Nature doth partake: for Sensitives being Perceptive <hi>Animals</hi> do not only Imagin, Feel, and the like, but also Perceiv, that they do so: wheras others only do what they do, without any such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon their Operations. Again, there are other less Simple Sensitive Notions Common to all perfect Sensitives, as that the Whole, while it is Whole, is greater then any Part therof divided from it: and so that Two are more then One, and the like. Also I suppose that they have some Generical Sentiment of Symmetry, Harmony, and the like; becaus these also are Common Sensibles, which they may, and do Perceiv, as well as Proper Sensibles. Besides these there are also Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Powers; as Ingeny, or Artifice, wherof all Sensitives, as Oisters, and the like do not partake, and so are said to wan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Imagination: wheras they also have that Common Perception, which I call Imagination, otherwise they should not be Sensitive:
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:61550:215"/>
and there are proper Notions, which belong properly to one <hi>Species,</hi> and not to another, as to a Bird to Sing and Nidificate, to a Spider to spin, to a Bee to make Honey, and the like; which, though they are very Ingenious and Artificial in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal performance, yet they are so wrought by them according to the Specifical Notions or Sentiments of their kind: as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant so Sucks; a Lamb flys a Wolf, which he never saw before; and a yong Hound hunts an Hare before he seeth it. Also by these Innate and more Immediate Notions the Imagination is able farther to Acquire, and Collect any other Sensitive Notions, of whatsoever it Perceiveth by any of the External Senses; which it doth likewise add and Ingraff into the others, and retein in itself, and gain Experience, and so may thereby be more Instructed to live the Sensitive Life therof. And the Imaginative Faculty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus furnished with Sensitive Notions, can Compound, and Divide them; and so discours of Singulars, or by Particulars, which are Sensible; as an Hound can distinguish one Hare from another, and an hunted from a fresh Hare, and therefore doth accordingly follow one, and not another: and so likewise the Sent of an Hare from the Sent of a Deer, or Fox, or Otter, or the like; and therefore doth accordingly follow it: for Singulars are only as so many Pictures of Individual Hares, and Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars as the Signe of any Hare, which are both Sensible: and none of these Operations may be denied to Brutes, which are otherwise distinguishible from Intellective Operations, as I shall shew heerafter. But though there be these Common Notions, or Prenotions, which are otherwise called Instincts, in Brutes, whereby they are apt to Perceiv Potentialy, yet they cannot Perceiv Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aly, without the Instrumentality of the Animal Spirits, and <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> therin (as well as their own Sensitive Irradiations) as I have shewed: which to prepare for themselvs, they have also a Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fike Power, whereby they can, as I said, Command and Move the Vegetative Spirit and Power therof, so to Actuate and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them accordingly as they call for them; and without all these, both Sensitive Principles, and Vegetative, and Inferior In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentalitys, the Sensation cannot be performed. All which, as I suppose, doth plainly appear by Memory; whereby, when we have Acquired any new Notions, and would Remember them, we thus, as it were, Dictate to the Inferior Facultys, and then
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:61550:215"/>
they produce a new Image or <hi>Species</hi> therof, which we do Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template: wheras if it were any former Image or <hi>Species</hi> therof, as hath been supposed, certeinly such should pass away with the Substance of the Nerval <hi>Succus,</hi> wherin it doth Subsist; and if that doth not Circulate as swiftly as the Bloud, yet it passeth away more or less continualy, and is recruited every Night by sleep: wherefore it is Impossible that the Images or <hi>Species</hi> should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main therin, which we have Acquired so many years since; but the Acquired Notions therof must necessarily remain in the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginative Faculty, which continues to be one and the same ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Individual Oeconomy of the Sensitive Spirit, and wherof the Animal Spirits have the Images Potentialy in themselvs. I have been informed by a Physician concerning a Knight his Patient, and my well known Friend, that sometime before his Death he could not Remember things done the same Day, and yet could very well Remember things done many years before; which was from the same reason, that the Notions which he had Acquired in his Youth, did remain in his Imaginative Faculty; which was now grown so weak, that he could hardly Acquire any new Notions; and so Youth doth best retein any such Acquired Notions, becaus they are then recent and fresh: and there are not many others before Acquired, which might oppress the Memory: for though Imagination be a very Spiritual Faculty, yet it is Finite, as well as Sens, and cannot Remember all, nor any more, or better, then according to the Strength therof; and these Acquired Notions are fixed by often Repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Meditation, and the like: and as the Sensitive Spirit is very Oeconomical, and therefore much delighted with Symmetry, and Harmony, so the Memory therof is helped by Order; and it will strangely piece its Notions together by any litle Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes or Allusions; and sometimes when it cannot suddenly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive and Dictate them, or if the Animal Spirits be not ready to Actuate and produce the Images therof, we say it is a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> our Tongs end; as when we are ready to utter a Word and are some way hindred. But as there are Deceptions of Sens, as I have shewed, so much more of the Imagination, as it is more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from the Sensible Object, which is Realy true in itself; not only as Imagination is a Judicative Faculty, and so may also Err, in Dividing, Compounding, and Discoursing thereby; but
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:61550:216"/>
in its most Simple Perceptions; for it is very Mimical, and can Imitate any thing, by its own Types, and Images of things which it did before Contemplate in the more Sensible Prototypes, by the Primary Sensation therof, as I have shewed: and though these Secondary <hi>Species,</hi> which are not Irradiated by the real Sensibles, are meer Phantasms, and farr more weak and Momentany then the others, yet I know not how, a vehement Imagination can so Intend them, that they shall appear as though they were Real; which certeinly is by some such extraordinary Power of the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getative Spirit, whereby it causeth External and Corporeal Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natures in the <hi>Foetus</hi>; and therefore may well caus such <hi>Species</hi> and Images in the Nerval <hi>Succus,</hi> by such extraordinary Anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Animal Spirits: which yet is also first caused by some very strong Acquired Notions in the Imagination, through Love, Pride, Covetousnes, Fear, or some such vehement Lusts and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and a proportionable Sensitive Irradiation thereby; and this is indeed <hi>Laesa Phantasia:</hi> but if those Passions be Sudden and Temporary, then the Imaginations are such also, as in sudden Frights, and the like; which are only <hi>Vno Impetu:</hi> or they may be only particular Distractions, according to such particular Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects about which the Imagination hath been so Intensly exercised; wherof we have a notable Example in him who was

and there are many known Instances of such persons, who are thus Habitualy distracted as to one Object, which whensoever it is mentioned unto them, that strong and vehement Notion ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which they have Acquired, is thereby Excited, and the Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasm so Sensibly Actuated, that it doth so Predominate, as to over-rule and over-turn all their other Notions, and the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Regularity therof: and I suppose, that most men have some Tincture of this Madnes, more or less; who though otherwise very Prudent and Sober, yet if mention be made of any thing wherin they affect to Excell, or which they vehemently Love; as their Wit, Valor, Gentility, Estates, Children, and the like; they will run out into such Extravagant discours therof, as if they were not the same men therin, as they are in other things: (which we call their Infirmitys), Also there is a General and To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Distraction, either Temporary, as in Drunkenes, or Anger,

There are also others, that think these <hi>Entia Sensationis</hi> to be some such Imaginary Things as are neither Entitys, nor Not-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titys, but they know not what; wheras, as I have said, Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is certeinly a Real Act; and the Phantasm a Real <hi>Species</hi>; which the Imagination doth behold, and whereby such Real Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects are produced, though there be no such Real Thing, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Imagination Imagineth it to be the Image or Picture; as a Picture of a Man at large is no less a Picture, though there be Realy no such Person <hi>in Rerum natura</hi> as well as the Picture of any Individual Person.

               <p n="5">V. Sensation, or Sensitive Life, is, as I have said, always with Perception and Appetite; otherwise it should not be Life: and therefore, as these two do Immediately Subsist in the Sensitive Spirit, so they do also always Cooperate to produce any Vital Act: for thus the Imagination doth Perceiv Spontaneously; and the Appetite Affect or Disaffect Perceptively: and these are the most Intrinsecal and Immanent Acts of both the Facultys, which they do so act between themselvs, but yet their own Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in themselvs, are as different and several as the Facultys; for to Perceiv, and to Affect any thing, do very much and very plainly differ: and so their maner of working is very different; for first the Imagination Perceivs, and Judges the Object to be Sensitively Good, or Evill; and so presents it to the Appetite, which accordingly Affects or Disaffects it; wherefore since se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Cells have been by some found out in the Brain, for the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginative, Judicative, and Memorative Powers, (which are only such several Powers of one and the same Imagination, wherin they do all Immediately Subsist) I wonder that never any such Cell hath been appointed by them for the Appetite, which is certeinly a distinct Faculty from the Imagination, and Subsisting Immediately in the Sensitive Spirit, as well as it. And as there are such several Powers in the Imagination, so also in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite;
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:61550:217"/>
but as first the External Sensible Object by making an Alteration in the Standard of Sens, which is within the Body, doth by it Irradiate the Animal Spirits, whereby the Sensible <hi>Species</hi> are produced, which the Imagination doth afterward also Irradiate, and Perceiv by a Primary Sensation, and accordingly after the Object is removed, Irradiate only by itself, and so Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the Phantasms therof, by a Secondary Sensation; so contrarily the Appetite, which followeth the Imagination, doth first Internaly Affect, or Disaffect, in itself, by its own Power which is its Primary Sensation; and then exerts its Appetitive and Motive Power by a Secondary Sensation, either in those Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections which we call the Passions of the Soul, or in the Motion of the Body or any part therof; and though the more Immediate Instruments of the Appetite be also the Motive Animal Spirits in the Nervs, yet it likewise causeth Fluxes and Refluxes of the other Blouds accordingly; which discovers a great Union and Consent between them; and as the Object of this Faculty gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raly is Sensible Good or Evill, so, according to all the Diversifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations therof, the Appetite doth exert itself in those several Passions, which we call Affections, and are, as it were, the Fluxes and Refluxes of the very Sensitive Soul, answerable to those of the Bloud and Spirits, whereby it so expresseth itself: for this Spiritual Faculty is not an idle and ineffectual Affection or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection of the Object, but also armed with a Power to Effect all the Sensitive Operations therof in the Body. And so also the very Motive Power, whereby the Vegetative Spirit is Guided in producing and Actuating the Phantasms for the use and service of the Imagination, is not only from the Imaginative, Perceptive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but also from the Appetitive Faculty Spontaneously. And thus in the same Sensitive <hi>Compositum,</hi> there is not only Local Motion of the Matter to Union, as in the Instance of Introsucti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Finger, and the like; and to Station, as when the Body falls down by its own Weight, and the like: and Elementary Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Rarefaction and Condensation, as I have formerly shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and also Vegetative Motion, as in Contraction of the Muscles; which certeinly cannot be Motions of the Matter, becaus they are Violent and contrary unto the Rest therof, and as I have shewed, in the <hi>Systole,</hi> the Heart lifts itself upward by this Vegetative Motion, but in the <hi>Diastole</hi> falls downward again by
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:61550:218"/>
its own <hi>Pondus</hi> of Matter; which for the same reason can be no Elementary Motion; for in the <hi>Systole</hi> it is contracted, and in the <hi>Diastole</hi> returns again to its own Elementary Laxity by its own Elastical <hi>Potentia,</hi> which was Spiritualy contrary to the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And as the <hi>Basis</hi> of the Heart being united to the Body, the Muscular Contraction therof doth thereby draw it upward, which otherwise it could not, so all such Muscular Motions are by such Traction to, or Trusion from another Body, as a Fulci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for so an Heart taken out Moves in the Hand; and a man bowing forward can lift up no more then according to the Weight of his Body, to which the Traction is; but standing Perpendicularly upright, he may lift up any greater Weight ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Muscular Strength, by Trusion from the ground, as a Fulciment; and so he bears up any Burden on his Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: wheras i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Also besides these Muscular Motions in the Flesh, and the constant Puls caused thereby, (which plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is Vegetative, or by a Pulsifike Power of the Vegetative Spirit,) there seems to me to be such a sudden and occasional Motion in all these Fluxes and Refluxes of the Bloud, caused by the Passions, as is not only Sensitive, but Vegetative: for I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that the Sensitive Appetite in all such Local Motions ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of doth thus Move the Body, not Immediately by itself, but by the Mediation of such Vegetative Motions; and so Guides and Governs them, Directively and Spontaneously, as I have shewed: as when I write, the Motion of my Hand and Pen generaly, is from the Elementary Motive Spirits in the Nervs, which the Vegetative Spirit Actuates and produces, and itself Moves by and with them, as it doth by and with the Muscles; or as my Hand writes by and with the Pen, only as a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And so that all such Motions in the Sensitive Body, which are not of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor only Elementary; that is, by Rarefaction or Conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, but of an higher Nature; that is, either by Expansion or Compression, or more Regular, as all Involuntary Motions, or more Various and Indifferent, as all Voluntary Motions, are Vegetative; but the Voluntary are also Guided and Governed by a Sensitive Motion: and that all such Motions, whereby we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv that we do so Guide and Govern them, are Sensitive. And such are all the Moving <hi>Imperia</hi> or Commands of the Sensitive Spirit, whereby it doth Spontaneously Move and Guide the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getative Spirit, in producing and Actuating the Animal Spirits, both Perceptive, and Motive, Arrecting the Muscles, and the like; and so <hi>Priapismus</hi> and others may be both Involuntary and Voluntary: and such Sensitive Motions though never so swift and sudden, yet are not Involuntary, but Voluntary, if they be with any Perception and Appetite; for in all these Motions the Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:61550:219"/>
Spirit is alway ready to Execute the Spontaneous Commands of the Sensitive Spirit, and is a very quick and Active Mover in itself, as appears by its own Involuntary Motions; but especialy in these wherin it is Subservient to the Sensitive Spirit, which is more Active, and requireth such fitt Instruments: and as the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Spirit Moveth in itself, as quick as Thought or Wish, so where no Deliberation is requisite or to be admitted, or there is an Acquired Use and Custom it presently Commandeth, Perceptively and Spontaneously, and is as presently Obeyed by the Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Spirit, though without any Perception or Spontaneity ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And thus I conceiv, that these two Sensitive Facultys, Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and Appetite, do Govern the whole Sensitive <hi>Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> residing together in the Brain, as they do Mutualy Coope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and that they or any of their several Powers are not seated in several Cells therof, as hath been supposed; but that the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of the Brain are for refining, percolating, and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Animal Spirits therin, by the Natural Chymistry of the Vegetative Spirit; and wheresoever these two Facultys have their Centrical Seat, which probably is in the Forebrain, or <hi>Cerebrum,</hi> as it is Eminently so called, they are both together, furnished with all their Sensitive Powers: for the Brain is not divided into several Organs, as an Ey, an Ear, and the like, but is all one Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan of these two Facultys, as the three Humors in the Ey, with their Coat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="409" facs="tcp:61550:219"/>
Affect or Disaffect Immanently, in such Actions as are performed between themselvs, as I before shewed; but also in all others, as the Appetite doth move the Vegetative Spirit to produce and Actuate Phantasms, as well as the Imagination doth Direct it what Phantasms it shall so produce and Actuate; and the Imagination doth also Direct the Vegetative Motions, as well as the Appetite doth Move and Guide them, but they are distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called Imaginative, or Appetitive Actions, accordingly as one or other doth Predominate therin. And as they are both thus Conjunct Spiritualy, in themselvs, so are they also with the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Body, thus Subordinating the Vegetative Spirit therin Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and by it the Elementary Mistion, and Matter to their Sensitive Spirit, by such Natural Aptitude and Combination, that as the Elementary Animal Spirits are refined and sublimated to the highest Purity wherof they are capable, and their Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Spirit indued with a greater Activity, then appears in any Grass, Herbs, or Trees; whereby they may ascend toward this Sensitive Oeconomy, and be the Instruments of a Sensitive Life; so the Sensitive Spirit also is made, as it were, to Condescend to them by a Conjunct Irradiation of the Imagination, and Eradia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Appetite, and cannot Live, nor Act, without them, nor by or with any other Elementary or Vegetative Instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality whatsoever; and therefore it hath its own Standards in its own Body; whereby only it doth Immediately perceiv and feel, as it doth the Temperament of its own Flesh, and the Alterations therin; and not any of the External Qualitys, as the Heat of the Fire, or Cold of the Air, without the Body, which only caus the Alterations without, whereby they caus the like within the Body, and so Mediately become Sensible; as the Weather is by a Weatherglass; and not otherwise. And these Internal, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed most Proper Sensibles only and none others do Irradiate the Animal Spirits in the Nervs, which are propagated to the Brain, where the Sensation is performed; and the Sensitive Soul also doth only Move its own Body, wherin it is confined, by its own Powers and Organs, and others thereby: as the Hand is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called the Instrument of all Instruments. And yet it is in itself a Living and truly Spiritual Substance, and so are all its own proper and Immanent Actions Spiritual, whereby it doth Abstract from more Coporeal Objects Sensitively, and also from more Gross
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:61550:220"/>
and Inferior Spirits, or Spiritual Qualitys; for so though by its Senses it doth Sensibly perceiv Heat, Cold, Pain, Burden, and the like, yet it can Immanently Contemplate, Affect, or Disaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, the Speculative Phantasms therof, without any more Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Sens, then it doth the Artificial Pictures therof: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the very Sensible <hi>Species,</hi> Irradiated by the Sensible Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys, are not such as the Sensible Qualitys themselvs, nor do they so Affect the Brain as they do the Standard; as I have shewed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus the <hi>Species</hi> are only Irradiated thereby: for so Sensible Heat and Cold do not Burn or Chill the Brain, as they do the Flesh, which is the Standard. Having thus farr absolved this <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of Sensation, I shall now referr it to the Judgment of learned Physicians, whom I have ever esteemed a Prudent and Sober Nation; and very deservedly; their Profession being a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Practice, and their Practice concerning the Life of Man. But I suppose I need not consult them, whether the Sensitive Soul be Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricaly seated in the Brain, or in the Diaphragm or Midriff; becaus it is also termed <hi>Phrenes,</hi> nor whether the <hi>Septum Lucidum,</hi> becaus it is termed <hi>Lucidum</hi> be the chief Organ therof; or as some say the <hi>Pine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alis Glandula,</hi> becaus it only is One and Solitary; a very fit Organ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed for such an Excrementitious Opinion, which none would ever have affirmed, nor can believ, who hath any purer part of Brain in him: and I very much wonder how such, who require of others a Mathematical exactnes, and Demonstration, can with so much Confidence and Impudence impose upon all others such a <hi>Gratis dictum,</hi> and lay this, as the Foundation of their whole Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Passions; making all Sensation to be only Local Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is a Common Sensible itself: wheras Sensation, as I have shewed, is a Perceptive and Spontaneous Action; and though a Body be never so Mechanicaly and Artificialy Composed, like <hi>Daedalus</hi> or <hi>Myron</hi>'s Cow; or be made never so Automatous, as the Clock at <hi>Strasburg, Archytas</hi> his Dove, <hi>Regiomontanus</hi> his Fly, or Eagle, or <hi>Albertus</hi> his Man, with all Imaginable Members, and Local Motions; not only a Philosopher, but every Vulgar Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, will say <hi>Deest aliquid intus:</hi> as though a Parret hath Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and Appetite, which they have not, and can imitate Human Speech, yet we all know that it hath no Human Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding: and even Vegetative Spirits, which have Plastical, and many other notable Motions, and so Elementary, as the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:61550:220"/>
and Magnet (which <hi>Thales</hi> therefore termed Animal) have many wonderfull Local Motions, yet they have no Perception or Appetite; which are Living Motions or Actions, wherof all others are only Counterfeits and outward Expressions, like the Motions of the dead <hi>Sultan,</hi> to deceiv the People; wheras any Living Man himself cannot be so deceived, but plainly may Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv the Difference in himself: for Local Motion, which, as I have said, is only Local Motion, is no Spiritual Action, which is not only Local, but also Spiritual, and not only Motion, but Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or an Active Operation, and Superoperation, as the Spirit is a Substantial Activity; especialy Sensitive Spirits, (wherof the very lowest are not only termed Creeping or Moving, but also Living Creatures) have such Living Motions or Actions: and such Motions or Remotions from one State to another, as from Death to Life, or from not such an Operation to such an Operation, are certeinly Motions, as well as from one Place to another: as they themselvs, who affirm them to be only Local Motions, do confess, in affirming them to be Motions, as they are indeed, but more or other then Local, that is, also Active Motions; and many of them such as may be performed without any Local Motion, as though the Appetite in Moving the Body, or any part therof, doth effect and exercise also a Local Motion, yet the very Appetition, and Imagination in itself, and many Operations therof are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Local Motion; which doth rather disturb Sensation; as in Seing, Hearing, and the like, if either the Body be Moved, or the Object Removed, the Sensation is disturbed: and though Sensible Objects Moving without, or Humors within, may Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualy Move Sensation by Tempting and Solliciting the Sensitive Spirit, humbly and Inferiorly, as that doth Move them by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding and Guiding them, Superiorly; yet they do not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Localy Move the Sensitive Spirit, or the Intrinsecal and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent Operations therof, as that doth Move them Transiently. And I suppose the next Attempt of them, who can thus affirm Sensation to be only Local Motion, will be to reduce Intellection and Volition, and our very Human Spirit, to this common debase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all Spiritual Natures, (which they generaly restrain to Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Local Motion) nor indeed is there any thing left, or any such clear difference assigned by them, which may priviledg us from it, but only the favor and Indulgence of these great Masters,
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:61550:221"/>
who can say and unsay, make and unmake, what they pleas, and how they pleas; and if all others were like to such, who have no higher Notions then Matter and Motion, it might with some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability be suspected that the Human Spirit is proportionably only Matter and Motion, which would perfectly gratify any who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore affect to be Epicureans in Opinion, becaus they are such in Practice. But, as <hi>Scipio</hi> said, It is now more fitt for us to return Praises to God for all these his Various and Wonderfull Works, which can never be confined only to Matter and Motion, then to attend such Triflers any farther.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Therefore let us prais the Father of the Spirits of all Flesh, and advance our Praises by a Song of Degrees, as he doth thus exalt his Creatures by several Degrees in the Scale of Nature. Who is Himself a Spirit, and Spiritual Life, Infinitely Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating and Enjoying Himself, and all other things in Himself; and hath given Life to all Living <hi>Animals,</hi> even the lowest Sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, which he hath placed in the same Animal Region with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellective Man; though all Sensitives be Classicaly different from him, and both Subordinate and Subservient unto him, as he is to God; who hath made them the Images of his Intellective Spirit, as he is of the Divine Spirit. Whereby also they can Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate and Enjoy themselvs, and all other Sensible Natures; which though Perfect in themselvs, and in their own <hi>Classes,</hi> yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out these Sensitive and Intellective Spirits, who only can Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template and Enjoy them, had been made in vain, as a Spectable World of many wonderfull and usefull Objects, without any Spectator, or Enjoyer therof; all whose Goodnes and Perfection, though Good in itself, is farr Inferior to the least Insect; whose Body though more Minute then the smallest Watch, or other Engine is more Curiously and Exactly composed then the greatest Machins; and whose Inimitable Spirit possesseth the whole Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible World, in the Potential <hi>Species</hi> and Images therof, within the litle Module of itself: wheras all Inferior Natures, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are in themselvs, are unto themselvs, as if they were not; and howsoever they may differ one from another, yet bury all their Specifical Differences in the common Grave of their own Imperception, as if they did still continue in their Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Chaos,</hi> or the Eternal Abyss of Nonentity. Wherefore Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitives
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:61550:221"/>
were presently Introduced, when they were before pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for these, as for their next and Immediate Ends of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, to perfect all their Perfections; which are not only farr more Excellent in themselvs, but thus also derive into themselvs all their Inferior Excellencies; Living upon their Inanimate Natures, while themselvs thus Live in their own Animate Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and are as farr above them; as themselvs are Inferior to Man; with whom, though they are not Coordinate, as Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitives, yet they do Convers, as Living Creatures: and their Sensitive Life, though farr Inferior to his Intellective Life, yet is not only an Image therof, but also in his own Human <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positum,</hi> the Embryonical Inception, and constant Companion therof: and his Sensitive Body the Immediate Mansion and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficine of his Intellective Spirit, and of all the Operations therof, in this Conjunct State; and the Imaginative Artifices of Sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>Animals</hi> are not only the Umbrages of his Intellective Act, but also in himself Subordinate Operators therunto. Also many of them have Language, that is either the Expression of their Notions by Signes, or of their Passions by Interjections, which is not only a Rudiment of his more Articulate Language but also some Rude Discours, and Essay of his Ratiocinations. And yet all these Vive Images of Man, and his next and Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate <hi>Convivae,</hi> are not only Subjugated to his Tyranny by his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Power and Policy, but also by God and Nature Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to his rightfull Roialty and Dominion; being all born his Slaves and Vassals, who while they Live, serv him in all Offices, either of Labor, or Pleasure, yea Hawk and Hunt, and destroy one another for him; or are otherwise subdued and destroied by himself. And so he Feedeth and Preserveth his own Individual Life with Innumerable Lives of their successive Individualitys; which are in Natures Account the most costly and Princely Diet, though two Sparrous be sold for a Farthing in the Market of Man.</p>

And God said unto them, Be fruitful, and Multiply, and replenish the Earth; and Subdue it, and have Dominion over the Fish of the Sea, and over the Fowl of the Air, and over every Living thing that Moveth upon the Earth. And God said, Behold, I have given you every Herb bearing Seed, which is upon

And he made both Man, and Woman, who might accordingly Procreate; and blessed them with the Blessing of Prolification, for the Increas of Mankind.

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were preserved, or such as are by Putrefaction, for
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:61550:223"/>
so they might be restored again: and indeed if such other Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitives could be made only of Matter and Motion, it had not been necessary that God should so Extraordinarily have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served any of them; for so also he might have restored them, and he doth nothing in vain: wherefore since it is mentioned expressly, not only that God did preserv them generaly accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their <hi>Species,</hi> but according to their Sexes, Male, and Female, <hi>to keep Seed alive upon the face of all the Earth,</hi> it is very evident that they were neither Originaly made only of Matter and Motion, nor could be so Naturaly restored. Also wheras it is said, that God made <hi>the Beast of the Earth</hi> which is conceived to be <hi>Fera Agrestis,</hi> or Wild beast, I suppose it may be so understood in a moderate Sens, that is, less Philanthropous and Tame, though not Ravenous, or Rebellious so as certeinly none were Created before the Fall and Curs. And there is still the same difference of more or less Philanthropy remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their very Natures; so that some, though otherwise as Fierce and Couragious as others, are easily Tamed; as Elephants, Bulls, Boars, Horses, Dogs, and the like: wheras others will very hardly be so Civilised; as Lions, Tigers, Bears, Wolvs, Foxes, and the like: and this Natural difference in themselvs is the ground and reason of their more or less Cicuration or Mansuefaction. And that there is such a difference in their very Natures, may appear by this, that they are not only so diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent toward Man, but also among themselvs; and so it is a common Observation, that the more Mansuete do flock and heard together, and Live in Consort; wheras Wild beasts Live more Solitary, and are more Strange even to one another. Yet certeinly none of them were Carnivorous at first, nor did devour one another; for both they and man had then another Diet appointed for them by God, that is, Vegetative; which which also Comprehends the Elements, and Matter, as subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate unto it; and as the Elements and Matter are its Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Body, so it is also Nourished by the same, wherof it is Constituted; and so the Vegetative Spirit may be Augmented by Mistion of more of the Homogeneous Vegetative Spirit latent in the Nutriment: and so the Matter, Elements, and a Vegetative Spirit, make the Body of Sensitives, whereby it is also Nourished, and may be Augmented by Mistion of more
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:61550:224"/>
of the Homogeneous Sensitive Spirit latent in the Nutriment; and now when we and some Beasts do feed on the Carcasses of other Sensitives, yet we do not, nor can we, feed on their Sensitive Spirits, or Lives; becaus they are dead, and there is no Conversion of one Sensitive Nature into another, nor any such Mistion by Augmentation, as of Equine and Asinine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in a Mule, or by Generation; nor yet is the <hi>Anima</hi> therof, or <hi>Anima Mundi,</hi> as some say, so Subordinate, either to Constitute, or Nourish the Sensitive, as Vegetatives and the rest are, and were so ordeined to be both for the Original Formation, and Nutrition of Sensitives; and thus they are not only Subordinate, as a Constituent Body, and N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Also though God did not so expressly appoint Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getatives, which are Terrestrial, to be food for Fishes that Live in the Water, yet probably they had the same food growing on the Shores and Banks; and such, as some report, may still be found in the bellys of Sea Morses, and such like Fishes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most as great as Whales. And though it be not expressly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned either heer, or after the Deluge, whether Fishes did not then also prey one upon another; as now they do, yet possibly they might, being made to bring forth abundantly, whereby they might both maintein their own <hi>Species,</hi> and be food for others, or perhaps they might be Nourished by their, own Element, Water. However I doubt not, but that some Beasts were Created farr more strong then others, as they still are; and that some were Venaturient, as now they are, and had the same Specifike Sagacity, as well as Noses; and so might hunt others with a great Natural Delight, as I suppose they now do with more then any Huntsman that followeth them; which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, not only by their Indefatigable Industry, but also by their very great Exultation, and Cry; yet I conceiv, that then they had no Cruentous or Murdrous Appetite; as now a Lion

But of all Sensitives Beasts are Supreme, that is, in their whole Bestial Kind generaly, and so particularly according to their several Ranks and Degrees, which is the true Rule of Comparison; though the meanest and lowest of of Beasts be: not more excellent then the chief Fowl or Fish, and so of Fowls and Fishes. And Beasts do not only excell the rest in their Bodily Constitution, as I have shewed, but much more in their Spiritual Qualitys, which are their very Sensitive Excellencys; though they may not have greater or more admirable Instincts then Fowls or Fishes; which are some special Endowments, wherwith Nature doth help out ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Inferior <hi>Animals,</hi> yea Insects, as Bees, Spiders, Silkworms, Ants, and the like; and of all others, Man himself, though he hath generaly the most excellent Sensitive Spirit Subordinate and Subservient to his Intellective Spirit, yet he hath least and fewest Instincts; and indeed I know none, except Sucking, which is most Common and Necessary; yet as he doth excell them all in the general Sensitive Powers and Virtues, whereby he can more Curiously Contrive and Effect things even by his Sensitive Imagination and Ingeny, and hath such a most fitt Organ therof, as the Hand; so do Beasts heerin generaly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell Fowls and Fishes; and accordingly have more fitt Organs then they, and their Brains are more Conformable to the Brain of Man; and he hath not only most Service from them, but also most Conversation with them: and thus they were made in the same Day with him, and next and Immediately before him; and as both he and they have their Sensitive Spirits pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and their Bodys formed of the Earth, so they both Live

Wherefore plainly he is such a Microcosm in himself, as I have described; and the last <hi>Valde bona</hi> is pronounced of him, as he is such a Microcosm, as well as of the great World. And now I shall first discours of Man generaly, according to the whole <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positum,</hi> which every Man hath in himself, and which is indeed that which we call, Man. And as a Traveller, who first by his Mapp setts forth and travells over the World, wherof he hath yet only a Notional Module or Image in his Mind, when he returns back again, he reviews his Mapp with those Real Apprehensions which he hath Acquired, and comparing both together, finds them to agree, and so being fully satisfied, as he did before Contemplate the World itself only as Notional, he now looks upon the very Mapp therof, as almost Real; thus having gone forth out of my self as it were into this Philosophical World, I seem now to return home again to my self, and in my own Human <hi>Compositum</hi> can behold the Abstract of all that I found abroad: and thus I shall likewise desire any other, who shall have travelled through these Discourses of the World, now to make himself and his whole <hi>Compositum</hi> the Sensible Experiment of the whole System therof, as God hath described it in this Divine History, which is also an Intellectual <hi>Epitome</hi> therof.

And as they thus Classicaly differ, so plainly they are Subordinate one unto another, according to the Scale of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: for so the Intellective Spirit generaly Commands and Governs the Sensitive Spirit, as the Rider doth his Hors; and the Sensitive the Vegetative, and the Vegetative the Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and the Elementary the Matter, as I have shewed at large, and any may Experiment in himself; for as this is the Scale of Nature, which God Erected, and the true Oeconomy therof, which he hath Ordered and setled in the World, so every Man hath, and if he attentively and duly consyder it, may evidently perceiv the same in his own <hi>Compositum.</hi> And, which is yet more admirable, as Man is this Centrical Orb of the whole World, not only Localy as he is in or upon the Earth, which is his Mansion, but Physicaly, as he is such a <hi>Compendium</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; so he is also Politicaly, according to the Divine Intention of the Creator, that one Nature, which all other Natures do Circumferentialy respect, and relate to him one way or other, as so many Lines to the Center: Wherefore as Angels probably were Created first, being the Supreme of all Natures; so Man was made last, as the Summ and Completion of them all, and the Political End therof, which was first in the Divine Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and last in the Execution.

Wherefore to retund their Perversity, and to assert the Native Dignity of Mankind, I shall evidently prove it by the Letter of the Text; which declares this to be the very Intention of the Creation of Man, <hi>Let us make Man after our Image, and in our own Likeness. And let them have Dominion over the Fish of the Sea, and over the Fowl of the Air, and over the Catell, and over all the Earth</hi>; and accordingly it is repeated again by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self unto Man, after he was made, that he might know and acknowledg it; <hi>Replenish the Earth, and Subdue it, and have Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over the Fish of the Sea</hi> &amp;c. and so after the Deluge, God again renewed this Great Charter to Mankind, when also he added a farther Priviledg of feeding on Sensitives. And it is still evidently so according to Natural Reason; for thus, as the Intellective Spirit of Man in his own Human <hi>Compositum</hi> Subordinateth all the Inferior Natures to itself, so also doth Man in his whole <hi>Compositum</hi> Subordinate them all to himself; not as Angels, who by their greater Power can overrule all or any of them, yea Man himself, Externaly and Violently, but by an Intrinsecal Right and Power of Sovereignty and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, whereunto Man was born, and hath it in himself accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Law of Nature: for so also, though Angels are more excellently Intelligent of all these Inferior Natures then Man himself; yet he is more Sentient therof, becaus he is Sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and they are not: and thus Man as one of them, and being more excellent then them all was made to be their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and Lawfull Prince, yet as in his own <hi>Compositum</hi> he hath not Actualy and Specificaly all the Differences of Inferior Natures, but only Classicaly, so he doth not possess nor hath

<pb n="426" facs="tcp:61550:228"/>
as I said, he also introduced into his Body the Intellective Spirit, and Life; for so he is said to breath into his Nostrills, that is, into such an Organical part of his Sensitive Body, as any Beast also hath; and not only into a Figure or Similitude therof, which a Statue may have; but plainly they were <hi>Carneae,</hi> and not <hi>Luteae Nares</hi>; and so was all his Body <hi>Carneum Corpus,</hi> and not <hi>Lutea Imago Corporis:</hi> and so <hi>Adam,</hi> after he was thus Immediately Created, that is, by Improper Creation of the Sensitive Body, and Proper Creation, of his Intellective Spirit, saith of <hi>Eve,</hi> who was also so Immediately Created by God, <hi>this is Bone of my Bone, and Flesh of my Flesh:</hi> and certeinly the Body of <hi>Eve</hi> was made of such a Sensitive part of the Body of <hi>Adam,</hi> and so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they were both Created by God; as it is said, <hi>Male and Female Created he them</hi>; and neither was the Soul of Man made Superior to that of the Woman, as the <hi>Iewish</hi> Rabbins most fondly affirm; nor yet the Body of Woman Superior to that of the Man, as some fond Amorists are apt to fansy. And wheras God is said to Build or Aedificate Woman, so also it is said that he Formed Man and Beasts. And this special Aedification of Woman out of the Rib or Side of Man, and not Immediately out of the Earth, was somwhat like Generation by Seed; which is a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision from the Body of the Parents, whereby the Child is as it were a part therof; and as that makes the Natural Union and <hi>Storge</hi> between them, so likewise this first Creation of Woman in such an Extraordinary maner, otherwise then of any other Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine <hi>Animal,</hi> (which is not so made, nor any Woman since of the Rib or Side of Man) was not only the Original Institution but Natural Law of Matrimony between Man and Woman in Paradise, more then between any other Sensitive Male and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male: and is so Interpreted in the following words, <hi>Therefore shall a Man leav his Father and his Mother, and shall cleav unto his Wife; and they two shall be one Flesh.</hi> And indeed this is the Foundation of all Civil Society, and Polity of Mankind, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he being naturaly <hi>Animal Sociabile</hi> excelleth all other Sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; for so Husband and Wife were not only before Father and Mother, but, as I may so say, the very Parents of Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality itself; and without Lawfull, that is, such Human Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, there is no Lawfull, or Human Filiation. Thus Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony doth unite not only Man and Woman between themselvs,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:61550:228"/>
but also their Children, as the <hi>Pignora</hi> of their Matrimonial Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and Conjugation, during Life; wheras the Bond of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial Copulation and Procreation is not constant, but even Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rental is soon forgott and vanisheth away. And this also in Mankind maketh Fornication to be Naturaly and Moraly unlawfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus <hi>he that is joined to an Harlot is one Body, for two (saith he) shall be one Flesh.</hi> And Matrimony is Mystical, and Typical of <hi>Christ</hi> and his Church; between whom there is a Spiritual, as this is a Carnal Union; and <hi>Christ</hi> hath married it to himself with an everlasting Covenant, as this is Mortal and Temporary: and thus the Apostle citeth the aforesaid Text, and subjoineth, <hi>This is a great Mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and his Church.</hi> Now wheras it is said, that God formed the Body of Man <hi>of the Dust,</hi> or as it is Literaly, <hi>Dust of the Ground,</hi> and not, as it is said of Beasts, <hi>out of the Ground,</hi> it may import a more Delicacy, or Tendernes, of the Human Body, proportionable to the more Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Sensitive Spirit, as Dust is a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And so also according to Reason; for these two Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are Classicaly Different in the same Human <hi>Compositum,</hi> as well as in a Brute and an Angel; for one is Material and United Mediately by the Inferior Spirits to the Matter, and the other Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material; and so the one can only be and Operate Conjunctly in and with the Matter and Body therof, but the other may be and Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Seperately without them: nor can these be two Spirits Mist together, any more then Matter and Spirit, (wherof, when they are Consubstantiated, the Matter is no less Matter, nor the Spirit Spirit; though they do Consubstantiate one another Mutualy and Conjunctly, whereby they are and Operate as one perfect Substance) and much less the Intellective and Sensitive Spirit of Man, which are not Consubstantiateed.

can understand what it should signify) the Facultys, Powers, and Qualitys, of the Sensitive Spirit, or the Sensitive of the Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Spirit, or the Vegetative of the Elementary Spirits, any more then a Spirit hath of the Matter, or the Matter of Spirits; nor can any one <hi>Species</hi> have the Proper Qualitys of another, for then they should not be such Proper Qualitys of its own <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>; And whatsoever Scholastical Notions any others may frame in their Minds, they who search into Nature itself, and consy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der things as they find them therin, must confess that as they can know nothing of Matter what it is, but by the Extension, Density, and like Affections therof, so neither of Spirits what they are but by their Proper Powers, and Qualitys; as it is truly said, that if a Stone could be made to have truly and Realy all the Proper Qualitys of Gold, it must be Gold, and have such an Actual Composition of the Elementary Spirits, wherin those Qualitys of Gold do Subsist: and however Philosophers might distinguish Notionaly, all Mankind besides would esteem it; and accept it, as true Gold. Wherefore if the Intellective Spirit of Man had, as they say, all the true and Real Propertys of a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Spirit, and also of a Vegetative it must be both an Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective and Sensitive and Vegetative Spirit, which is a Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, not only of <hi>Species,</hi> but of <hi>Classes:</hi> and so Man should be a greater Monster then a Mule, or the like Mist <hi>Animals:</hi> for so indeed there may be a Mistion not only of Homogeneous Substantial Spirits, as in all Augmentation, whereby more of the same Specifical Spirit latent in the Nutriment is taken into the Individuality and Oeconomy of the Substantial Spirit of the Principal <hi>Compositum,</hi> and Mist with the very Substance therof; but also Homoeogeneous Spirits of the same <hi>Clussis</hi> may be so Mist, in Primitive Generation, as in a Mule, and the like; and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus it is Confusion of the <hi>Species,</hi> it may not continue and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate others: for Nature doth abhorr all such Rape and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence offered unto her, in her Specifical Oeconomys, and will not endure any Successive Multiplication of a new <hi>Species</hi> (as it is therefore Proverbialy said, <hi>Cum Mula pepererit</hi>) as well as she doth also abhorr the Abolition of any of her Regular <hi>Species,</hi> which are as so many Members of her great Body, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God did so Extraordinarily preserv them in the Deluge. And though it is true that even Sensitive Spirits becaus they also do
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:61550:229"/>
Live have Perception and Appetite, which are Analogous to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellective Understanding and Will; and so also all Analogous Affections of Love, Hate, Joy, Grief, Hope, Fear, and the like Living Facultys; as there are many such Analogys in Nature between several Classical Spirits and Spiritual Qualitys, yea between them and Matter and the Affections therof, as I have observed; yet they are still Classicaly Different, as well as there are the like Specificaly Different Analogys between the like Intellective Facultys and Powers in Men and Angels. And by these Analogys and Correspondences in her several Members, Nature doth Confederate and Combine and Unite all her <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posita,</hi> and her whole Body, and make it one Conjunct Univers in the Whole; and so doth the Human <hi>Compositum</hi> or Nature of Man, (which is, as I said, the <hi>Epitome</hi> of the Univers) thus Confederate and Combine and Unite all the Classicaly Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Natures in itself. Thus there is both such a Combination and <hi>Compositum</hi> of the Whole, and also a Classical Difference of the several Natures in themselvs, as so many parts and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers therof, which yet are not Mist or Confounded one with another any more in the litle <hi>Compositum</hi> of Man, then in the great Body of the Univers; wherin certeinly they are so Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, otherwise there should be no such D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And it may Sensibly appear that there are such several Spirits in Man, by their several Operations, which are not only Naturaly Different, but Actively Contrary, as I have shewed, and caus a Conflict in him, as it were between two several <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals</hi>; for so it is confessed by all Philosophy, that the Sensitive Spirit doth Rebell against the Intellective, for the Sensitive Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination and Appetite, or the Intellective Understanding and Will, do never so resist and oppose one another; but what the Imagination determineth, and so representeth to the Appetite, as Sensual Good, or Evill, the Appetite accordingly Affecteth, or Disaffecteth it, without any Renitence or Regret; and so it is also between the Understanding and the Will: but the only Dispute in the same Spirit, Sensitive, or Intellective, is in the Deliberation concerning several Sensual or Intellectual Object<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, or Circumstances therof, and the like, before the Imagination,
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:61550:230"/>
or Understanding, can judg and determin that this, or that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, so Circumstantiated, is Sensualy, or Intellectualy, Good, or Evill, or Better, or Wors: wheras after the determination is once past, the Appetite doth follow the <hi>Vltimum Dictamen</hi> of the Imagination, and the Will of the Understanding without any the least Renitence and Regret, most Spontaneously, and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily. Wherefore such Opposite Operations as are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly between the Sensitive Imagination and Intellective Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and Sensitive Appetite and Intellective Will, plainly declare that the Intellective and Sensitive Spirit in the same Man are Realy different, as well as they are so in Brutes and Angels; yea and more evidently, becaus there is no such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict in either of them, who are wholy Sensitive, or wholy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellective; and though the Sensitive Spirit in Man did perfectly submitt to his Intellective Spirit in his first Creation, yet they did then also as Realy Differ in their own Natures, which are not altered by the Fall, and as they now do as much Naturaly Differ when they agree, as when they disagree; though the Actual disagreement doth more Sensibly manifest the Natural Difference: as Actual Heat and Cold, Moisture and Drines de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the Elementary Spirits to be Different Substantial Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; and though they being all of the same <hi>Classis,</hi> may be united into one <hi>Mistum,</hi> and their Qualitys into one equal and agreing Temperament, yet the Sensitive and Intellective Spirits in Man being Classicaly Different, neither themselvs, nor their Facultys, nor Operations, can be so Mist; and so any Man may feel in himself, that when in such a Conflict, the Will, which is Intellective, doth prevail and Over-rule the Operation, the Sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Appetite doth not mingle itself with it, but as it were also by itself reluct and repine, and assoon as it can return to its own Sensual Cours: and when the Appetite doth prevail and overrule, the Will doth in like maner mourn, and bewail itself, and assoon as it can return to its own Rational Cours: which Sensibly satisfieth me, that they are and remain such Different Spirits, or Substantial Principles, Facultys, and Operations, though they be all in the same Human <hi>Compositum.</hi> And wheras it is said, that the Human <hi>Embryo</hi> first lives the Life of a Vegetative Plant, then of a Sensitive Brute, and lastly, of an Intellective Man, though I have shewed how it indeed begins to live the Sensitive and Intellective Life together in
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:61550:230"/>
one and the same Instant, and so it is said <hi>Man became a Living Soul,</hi> or Person, becaus they are both truly and properly Lives, and the Intellective Denominates the whole Person, Man: and assoon as the Sensitive Life dieth, and the Breath, which is the Instrument therof, ceaseth, and expireth, the Intellective also departs; and as long as the Sensitive Life remains, though in any <hi>Deliquium,</hi> or the like, the Intellective continues; and so the Wise-man saith of men, <hi>as one dieth so dieth the other, yea, they have all one breath:</hi> yet it is very true, that the Vegetative Life, as they call it, is before the Sensitive, as may appear by the <hi>Punctus saliens,</hi> in the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the <hi>Foetus</hi>; and wheras they say, that this is only the Operation of the Sensitive Soul in a Brute, and of the Intellective in a Man, so Operating Eminently by those Inferior Powers which it hath in itself, before it can exert its own Proper Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Powers, it seemeth to me very Absurd and Improbable, that it should putt forth any such Eminent Powers which must Subsist in the Proper Powers, before those Proper Powers be Actuated, wherin it must Subsist; as Emanant Light, or Heat, are Potenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aly, that is Formaly, and not only Eminently, in Inherent, but certeinly cannot be Actualy exerted before the Inherent be Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, and doth Operate Actualy: though indeed, as I have said, no Proper Quality of one Specifical Spirit can be, Actualy, or Potentialy, in another, either Immediately, or Mediately, as the Proper Qualitys of the same Specifical Spirit may be: and so as Emanant Light, or Heat, doth Immediately Subsist in Inherent, and Mediately in Aether or Fire. Wherefore there are three such distinct Spirits, Intellective, Sensitive, and Vegetative, in the Human <hi>Compositum</hi>; and also the fower Elementary Spirits (and they only Mist together in one) nor hath ever any yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that they also were Eminently in all or any of the others, as that the Intellective, Sensitive, or Vegetative Spirit, is Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently Hott, Cold, Moist, or Dry, or the like: and yet they might and must affirm this as well as the other, becaus they also are Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and not the Bodily Matter. And thus there are indeed, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plainly, Seaven Different Spirits in every Human <hi>Compositum</hi>; not Possessing it or the Body of Matter, (as the Seaven evill Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits did, which our Savior cast out of <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi>) but In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming, that is, Inspiriting it Naturaly, and according to the whole Scale of Nature, wherof they are all the Classical Spirits:
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:61550:231"/>
and if they were not all in the Human <hi>Compositum,</hi> Man should not be truly the <hi>Epitome</hi> of Nature, or any such Microcosm in himself: but as certeinly as he is Composited of Matter and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which yet remain distinct and different Natures in one and the same <hi>Compositum,</hi> so he hath also all the Inferior several Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in him as well as the Matter, and the Matter as well as them; all which together are his Human Body, and not only the Matter, and Elementary Mistion. And now, becaus I know that this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of so many several Spirits in every one Man will seem very strange to any, who doth not attend, and rightly consyder, the true System of Nature, as it is described in this History of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, both Proper, and Improper; and becaus many Christian Philosophers, who strongly maintein and affirm the Proper Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World against all Atheism and Heathenism, yet do not heerin also, as they ought, oppose the Improper Creation by God against Human Philosophy and Inventions of Men from which they have derived some preconceived Notions, which are their only Objections against this Doctrine; I shall recapitulate briefly what I have formerly more fully declared, whereby they shall plainly understand that the Objections are only Notions, and that it is not, nor can it be, Realy so in Created Nature. Thus, as I have said, God the Creator is the only true Eminence, or Eminent Causality; who comprehending all Possibilitys, not For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maly, but Eminently, in his own Infinite Omnipotence, could, and did Create, what he pleased from Absolute Nonentity, and so still doth comprehend all Created Entitys, not Formaly, but Eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his own Infinite Entity in an Infinite and Incomprehensible maner: but as it is Impossible that any thing should be Generated Actualy, wherof there is only a Nonentitative Possibility, and no Entitative Potentiality (as I have distinguished them) becaus Generation is no Creation; so it is also Impossible that any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Agent should Act or Operate by any Power, which it hath not Formaly in itself, but only Eminently, as they say: for if it can so Act and Operate, then it hath Formaly that Power where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it doth so Act or Operate; otherwise it should Act or Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate without the Formal and Univocal Power; or it should have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and not have it, both which are equaly Impossible; and so they say, that the Soul of Man doth Sens, and Vegetate, and the like, and yet hath no Sensitive, or Vegetative Powers, and the
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:61550:231"/>
like, or that it hath them Eminently, and not Formaly; that is, it hath them, and it hath them not. But since it is most certein that the Human <hi>Compositum</hi> doth Sens, and Vegetate, and is Hott, Cold, Moist, Dry, Realy and Formaly, as well as any Beast, or Tree, or Stone, or the like, it is most evident that it hath Formaly the Sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Vegetative and Elementary Powers, and Qualitys, as well as they: and then by their own Argument, becaus the Intellective Soul cannot have them Formaly, there must be also in Man a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive, Vegetative, and all the fower Elementary Spirits, wherin they do Formaly Subsist. Again, becaus God is Infinitely one most Simple Essence, therefore he doth also Act and Operate by his Essence; but all Created Substances (even Angels themselvs, as I shall shew heerafter) are not Simple as God, but have their Substances and Accidents, and Act and Operate by their Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental Powers and Qualitys, and so their Nature is composed of Substances and Accidents. And the mutual Conversation of one Substance with another is by their Accidents that are their Emissarys and Agencys, and which meeting and joining together, (as Light with Color) by their Conjunction, and mutual Action and Passion, the Operation is produced, (which, as I have said, cannot be in Vacuity, or without some Contact Corporeal, or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual) and as we thus Act and Operate Immediately by Accidents, and upon Accidents, so by them Mediately we know Substances of other things, and not otherwise. Thus the Intellective Soul doth Act and Operate by Understanding and Will, and by their proper Irradiations and Eradiations, as I shall shew heerafter; and so the Sensitive Soul by its Imagination and Appetite, and their proper Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiations and Eradiations, as I have shewed before: whereby we know them to be what they are, and therefore since Man doth thus Sens, as well as Understand, and the like, he hath also Substanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aly in his <hi>Compositum</hi> a Sensitive, as well as an Intellective Soul, and the like; otherwise we must affirm his Intellective Soul to be also a Sensitive Soul, which is to confound Natures Classicaly Different; and we may as well affirm it to be Vegetative, and Elementary Spirits, and Matter itself, which all make the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Compositum.</hi> Again, as Matter, being an Imperfect Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, must be Composited with Spirits to perfect it; so every Spirit that is Inferior is more Composited with it and others; and the more Superior less, as I have shewed: and this <hi>Compositum</hi> doth
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:61550:232"/>
not produce any new Substance which is <hi>Forma Compositi,</hi> nor is any such introduced into it <hi>aliunde,</hi> but it is only the Result of the Composition itself, and the Real Relation therof, not Abstractly and Metaphysicaly; as Entity, <hi>Genera, Species,</hi> and the like, but Concretely and Homophysicaly, as I may term it; as the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, all Animals, all Men, and the like, which are also so many Physical <hi>Individua:</hi> and so is the Human <hi>Compositum</hi> or Man, so many Physical Spirits and Matter Composited together. (And this is only a Natural Corporation, wherin the Intellective Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit Predominates, and so Denominates the <hi>Compositum</hi>) and the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Compositi,</hi> which is one, is only the Result therof, and according to the Scale and Oeconomy of Nature the <hi>Composita</hi> are thus Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raly United together: for so the Elementary Spirits do Immediately Consubstantiate the Matter of the Body of Man, and are all fower Mist together, and have their fower first, and such other Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Qualitys, (which are yet Occult and unknown to us) Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated therin, as well as in any other Elementary <hi>Compositum,</hi> Stone, Wood, or the like, that is, in the Primigenious Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="436" facs="tcp:61550:233"/>
or Weep against our Will; and it is only a Sensible Titillation, or Verberation of the Flesh, and a Sensual Delectation, or Pain thereby, which causeth Laughter or Weeping in such cases: though there be a great Analogy between the Sensitive and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellective Risibility, as well as between other Sensitive and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellective Affections, which I mentioned before. And now I shall proceed to consyder another greater Question, and of greater concernment; Whether the Intellective Spirit, or Soul, as well as the Body of Man, be <hi>ex Traduce,</hi> as they term it, that is, only Generated by the Parents, as the Decision of the Seed of any other Sensitive <hi>Animals,</hi> or Immediately Created by God? Wherin first I do acknowledg, as before, that the Sensi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ive, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getative, and Elementary Spirits of Man, as well as the Matter of his Body, are so Generated by the Parents, becaus all these are only the Human Body, as I have shewed, according to the Scale of Nature: and thus God did at first produce the Sensitive Spirit of Man by Improper Creation Immediately, as he did all other Sensitive Spirits, latent in the first <hi>Chaos</hi>; wherin also the Proper Sensitive Spirit of Man was so latent, as well as his Inferior Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, both Vegetative, and Elementary; all which were Created in the Beginning by a Proper Creation: and so farr I grant a Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existence of these Spirits, which are in all Men, as well as of the Spirits of Brutes, and Plants; which as they were afterward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by an Improper Creation by God, and now are Generated by their Parents Successively, so God and Nature, who do nothing in vain, did then so produce them, and they do still so Generate them in Man, as well as in Plants and Brutes. But I deny that the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective Spirit of Man is latent in the Seed, becaus it was not so latent in the <hi>Chaos</hi>; nor Generated by the Parents, becaus it was not so produced by an Improper Creation, but Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately Created by a Proper Creation; and Infused by God as it were <hi>aliunde,</hi> and so Inspired, as it is very fitly expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, in respect of the maner of Infusion therof; for though God cannot be said Properly to Breath, yet as it is a Substantial Activity and Life, so it is termed <hi>Spiritus,</hi> or Breath; and though itself be not Properly a Breath, yet as it was Infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the same Instant, when God also by Improper Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion produced the Sensitive Spirit, which is the other Life (and so is termed, <hi>the Breath of Life,</hi> which distinguisheth it
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:61550:233"/>
from any Vegetative Spirit, as I have shewed), so God is said to breath into the Nostrills of Man this Breath of Life; and as by Inspiration, the Breath assoon as it is out of the Inspirer, is in the Inspired, so this Intellective Soul of Man was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused into him, assoon as it was Created by God; and thus according to the Sentence of the Scholeman, <hi>Creando Infundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, &amp; Infundendo Creatur,</hi> and was not Praeexistent, as the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive, or any other Inferior Spirit, or the Matter, (as some Jewish Rabbins and Rabbinical Christians have Imagined) nor latent in any <hi>Chaos</hi> of Potentiality, but only <hi>in Divina Potentia,</hi> which can Create any Possible Nonentity, and produce it into Entity; wheras Natural Generation is only the production of Potential Entity, or Essence, into Actual Entity, or Existence, as I have shewed. And God is said to breath it into the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strills, rather then any other part of the Body, becaus thereby is the passage for Vapors into the Brain, which is the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical Seat of the Soul, as is heerby also intimated. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as all Successive Generation is conformable to the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and all other Spirits which were then only produced, and not Properly Created, are still Generated by the Parents; so the Intellective Soul of Man, which was then not produced, nor Improperly, but Properly Created (both in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> whom he called Flesh of his Flesh, but not Soul of his Soul) is still Created by God, and not Generated by the Parents as God himself testifieth, <hi>All Souls are mine; as the Soul of the Father, so also the Soul of the Son is mine,</hi> and <hi>Elihu</hi> acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the same of himself, <hi>The Spirit of God hath made me, and the Breath of the Almighty hath given me Life.</hi> And it is so Rational, that unless we also acknowledge it, we must affirm that our very Intellective and Rational Souls were partly in the Seed of our Father, and partly in the Seed of our Mother, and so by their mingling together, Mist into one; as the fower Elementary Spirits, or the Muline Spirits, and the like; and so that half an Human Soul was lost by the sin of <hi>Onan.</hi> And if the Soul of Man be thus Miscible, then it may be also Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist again, and is Divisible, and consequently Corruptible, as well as Generable; with many other such Absurditys, which do necessarily follow this Erroneous Opinion.

               <p n="4">IV. I shall now discours farther of the Intellective Spirit of Man, which is his Angel, or <hi>Daemon,</hi> as it is in this Conjunct State in his Body, and as it Operates therin. And heer again we must review the Scale of Nature, and of the <hi>Composita</hi> therof; wherin all such as are Imperfect Substances in themselvs, and cannot Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert themselvs in their Oeconomys, nor Operate without a Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with others, do therefore accordingly affect that Union, Naturaly and Necessarily, and disaffect to be disunited; which I call their Composition, and Consubstantiation, whereby they are mutualy Conjoined, and Perfected; as Matter, which is such an Imperfect Substance, cannot be pure or alone, but doth so affect an Union with Spirits, whereby it is Inspirited, Activated, and Perfected, or as they term it Informed, and so made, as it were, a Spiritual Matter: and the Elementary Spirits which are lowest and next unto it, becaus they cannot so Oeconomicaly Exert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs, nor Operate without a Body of Matter, as their Vehicle, Domicil, and Officine, do therefore mutualy affect an Union with it, whereby they are Embodied, and so are said to be Material Spirits: and though any Body and Spirit make a Complete <hi>Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>situm,</hi> yet as Elementary Spirits, which are the lowest, may be more highly Exalted and Purified by Vegetative Spirits, so they also affect an Union with them, whereby they are so much Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limated,
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:61550:236"/>
as I have before shewed concerning the Bloud, and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits; and the Vegetative Spirits, becaus they cannot so Oeconomicaly Exert themselvs, nor Operate without an Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Body, as their Vehicle, Domicil, and Officine, do therefore mutualy affect an Union therewith, whereby they are also Embo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died in them, Immediately, and, Mediately in and by them, in the Matter, and so are also termed Material Spirits: and the Proper Vegetative Spirit of Sensitives, as it may be more Advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Sensitive Nature by the Sensitive Spirits, so also it doth affect an Union therwith, whereby it is so much Spiritualised, as I have shewed in the Involuntary Motions, and other Sensitive Offices and Services therof: and the Sensitive Spirits, becaus they cannot so Oeconomicaly Exert themselvs, nor Operate without their Proper Vegetative Bodys, as their Vehicles, Domicils, and Officines, do therefore mutualy affect an Union therwith, whereby they are also Embodied in their Proper Vegetative Spirits Immediately, and so in and with them Mediately in the Elementary Spirits and Matter, and so are also termed Material Spirits. Thus they all Consubstantiate one another being Localy and Oeconomicaly in the matter of their Bodys <hi>per omnia puncta,</hi> and so Coextended thereby, and more or less Divisible therwith, as I have shewed; Also they penetrate one another without any penetration of Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, becaus they have no Extension of themselvs, but only are Coextended, as I said, in and by the Matter, that is, they are in their own Vehicle, Domicil, or Officine, which they Inspirit and Inform, as their Body and Seat, from which, or any part therof, they abhorr to to be removed, or that it should be in any maner discontinued; but though they be thus Localy United, and Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raly Composited and Consubstantiated, yet their Consubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Natures are still Classicaly Different, and they are still di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Matter and Spirits, or one Spirit, and another, as before, both in their Essences, Affections, and Operations, and do not participate of one another; for the Extension of Matter is neither Hot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

in <hi>Tepor,</hi> and the Equine and Asinine Spirits in a Mule, which are no longer a Distinct Heat and Cold, Hors and Ass, nor only a <hi>Compositum,</hi> but a <hi>Mistum</hi> of both, like the Mistion of more of the same Specifical Spirit in the Seeds of both Parents, wherof one is not Prolifike without the other, and in the Augmentation of Vegetatives, or Sensitives, Indistinctly and Confusedly. Now the Intellective Spirit of Man being a Perfect Substance in itself, and such as may Individualy Exert itself, and Operate Separate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and doth not Inhere, as Light in a Lucid Body, but is as Light in the <hi>Diaphanum,</hi> is therefore neither Consubstantiated with the Sensitive, or any other Inferior Spirits, or the Matter any more then an Angel, who Possesseth an Human Body; nor can it be Mist with the Angelical Nature, or any Angelical Spirit, or with more of any Human Spirit; becaus it is Immediately Created by God, a Perfect Substance in itself, Ingenerable, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible, Immis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ble, and Indivisible, as well as any Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Spirit. And yet as there is some mutual Indigence and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation in and among all Created Natures, as so many parts and Members of the Universal Body therof, so even Angels, who are most Immaterial, (not only as other Spirits, wherof none is any Matter, as I have shewed) but have least need therof, either by Consubstantiation, as they, or Inhabitation of a Body, as the Human Spirit, yet becaus they also have no Extension of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs, whereby they may be in their own <hi>Vbi,</hi> or Place, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must be in the Universal Body of the World, and in some part or <hi>Vbi</hi> therof, as Magnetical Virtue is in any <hi>Medium</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently, and when they are in one Place, they are not, nor can they be in another, nor can Instantaneously pass from one to another, nor can annihilate or evacuate the Nature of Extension, or the Density, or Gravity of Matter, nor do any thing contrary to the Law therof, nor Infinitely overcome it, but Finitely, and according to some certein proportions: and therefore Move not so swiftly through more Dens, as through more Rare Matter, nor can so easily lift more Grave as more Light, as I have shewed: and I grant that there is also such Coordination between the highest and lowest Nature, Angels and Matter; becaus they are both Natures, and Created Entitys, conteined within this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers as Parts and Members therof, and within the Universal <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> of all Created Entity; but they have otherwise no Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:61550:237"/>
with any particular Body of Matter, nor have any such Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicles, Syderous, Igneous, Aereous, Aqueous, Terreous, as some suppose, whose Souls are so farr Immersed in the gross Matter, as that they cannot conceiv Angels, or any thing to be Immaterial, or without a proper Body of Matter, nor God himself, without an <hi>Vbi</hi>; though his Immensity be Infinite, and Infinitely Different from all that is Finite, and therefore Infinitely free from all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension, Place, Space, or <hi>Vbi,</hi> or any Notion, or Imagination therof, becaus it is Incomprehensible, and such as must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged and adored, but can never be comprehended. Wheras Man, though he be more concerned in the Matter, and Material Spirits, then Angels, and so may be said himself to be more Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial then they, yet as he is litle lower then the Angels, and much higher then the other Inferior Natures, (wherof also all, except the Matter, are Spirits) should more Contemplate Spirits, and their Spiritual Nature, and not wholy bury himself in Matter, who hath no such Union with it Immediately, or Mediately, but that he may Exist in his own Intellective Spirit, and Operate Separately without it in his Separate State; though as he is the <hi>Epitome</hi> of all Classical Natures, so he doth Subordinate all the others unto himself, as they do one unto another in this Conjunct State; and though his Proper Sensitive Spirit, as well as others, doth also Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaly and Necessarily affect this Union, yet he doth not so mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aly affect it, as that he cannot Be, and continue in his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuality and the private Oeconomy of his own Spirit, and Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Separately without it in his Separate State as well as Angels: and yet being also capable of this Conjunction or Composition as well as other Spirits, though in another maner, as I have shewed, he doth Naturaly indeed, but not Necessarily, affect it, as they do: and so is the great <hi>Amphibium</hi> between both, apt to live Conjunctly and Separately in both Worlds, and in the lowest Earth, and highest Superaether. And thus the Human Spirit in this Conjunct State is in the Body, not Inherently, as I have shewed, nor yet so in its Element, as a Fish in the Water, which cannot live out of it, or as a Plant that is Rooted in the Earth; but as a Master in a Ship, who can also live out of it; or, as the Scripture more aptly expresseth it, as in a Tabernacle, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he shall not abide long; and so the Rabbins call the Body <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gina Animae.</hi> But wheras the Schoolmen say, that it is <hi>Tota in toto
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:61550:237"/>
&amp; tota in qualibet parte Corporis</hi>; I cannot understand it of the very Substance of the Soul, nor do I conceiv it to be Intelligible: for though I acknowledg it to be not only as a Master in one part of a Ship, as in the Heart, or Head; but like <hi>Hercules in Vrceo</hi>; possessing and filling all the Vessel; and also that it hath all its Facultys and Powers every where in the whole Substance of itself, either Actualy or Potentialy; becaus it is Indivisible, and hath no Extensive, but only Coextensive parts, and them not so Coextensively United to the Matter, as Inferior Spirits are; yet it doth Operate Actualy in one part rather then another, (which the Scripture Comprehensively calleth the Heart, and sometimes more particularly the Head) and so indeed it must, becaus it now Operates by the Instrumentality of the Sensitive Spirit, which is Centricaly seated in the Head and Brain, and not so in the whole Body, (though it Opera e Communicatively and Diffusively through the whole Body) but in other parts, where it is also, it doth not so Operate, Actualy: and as it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not so Operate, and not so Opera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nor doth the Spiritual Intirety and Indivisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Human Soul alter the nature of the Extension of the Body, or Coextension of itself; nor do they, or either of them, destroy the Intirety and Indivisibility therof, which is not Local, as is supposed, but only Spiritual; as a Ray, or Orb of Emanant Light is Spiritualy Intire and Indivisible in the Lustre, or Image therin, but not Localy, (for it may be measured by so many Inches, Feet, and the like, Coextensively, according to the Extension of the Diaphanous Body wherin it Localy is) but Spiritualy, so as you cannot clip off an Inch, or an hairs breadth, of the Ray; and wheresoever that is, there is also the Lustre and Image: and so you may measure a Man, both Body, and Soul, according to his Bodily Extension. Yet if a Leg, or Arm,
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:61550:238"/>
or half the Body, by a <hi>Turkish</hi> Torture, be cut off, the Soul, or any part therof, is not divided; but as the Light retires into it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, when you divide the Diaphanous Body, so doth the Soul, which is yet Spiritualy more Intire and Indivisible then the Light; for that by Reflection is Reduplicated, and fortified more in and by that Reduplication; wheras a Man, who hath lost a Limb, is not more or less Intellective then before, becaus the Intellective Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is perfectly Intire and Indivisible in the Spiritual Substance, and all the Facultys therof within the Body, and more then any Emanant Quality is out of the Body; and so is one perfectly Intire and Indivisible Individuality and Oeconomy in itself, farr otherwise, and more then any Tree, or Eel, or other Vegetative, or Sensitive, as I have shewed. And I shall now endeavor to shew how the Intellective Spirit doth Operate in this Conjunct State, both in the Understanding, and in the Will: for though it be, as I said, most perfectly Intire and Indivisible in its Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and in its Facultys, and Operations therin, yet as a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Creature, it hath its Substance, Facultys, and Operations, of several distinct Natures; and is not only Essence, and so doth Operate only by its Essence, as God the Creator, but as other Spirits, or Substantial Activitys, it also hath its Substance, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Acts; and as the Sensitive Spirit is a Life, as well as the Intellective, so it is the neerest and best Resemblance therof; having, as I said, Sensitive Imagination, and Appetite, and the rest of the other vital Facultys, respectively Subsisting therin; for so hath the Intellective Spirit an Analogous Understanding, and Will, and the rest of the other Vital Facultys, respectively Subsisting therin. Also as there is Imprinted and Implanted by God the Creator in the Imagination a general Perception, or No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, so there is such a general Intellection or Notion in the Understanding, which I shall better explain by what I have said before of Sensation: for so as I said, this Notion is not only a Simple Operation, as all Inferior Operations are, but besides the very Operation there is a Perception therof in any Brute, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is Perceptive, that it doth See, or the like, (as well as it doth Perceptively Affect, as I have said) Conjunctly in and with the Operation itself, though not Reflexively afterward, or by a farther Consyderation what Seing is, as in Man. And this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct Operation is, as I said, Living, and Sensitive, and is first
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:61550:238"/>
by the Power of the Imagination, whereby it so Operateth, that is, Seeth, or the like: wherin, as I have shewed, first the External Light, doth Irradiate the Colorate Object, and by the Reflected Rays therof convey the <hi>Species</hi> wherwith they are tinged to the Ey, and there the Internal Light doth again Irradiate them, and by the Reflected Rays therof convey them to the Animal Spirits in the Optike Nervs, and Brain, so prepared by the Vegetative Spirit to be fitt Instruments of the Sensitive Soul, and which Actuateth the Potential Images therin, so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

conceiv that their Sensible <hi>Species</hi> are in like maner Irradiated respectively (though I want other respective Terms to express it) by the Imagination: thus in Hearing there is a Sensible Sound con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to the <hi>Aura</hi> in the <hi>Tympanum,</hi> though I know not, that there is any Emanation therof, nor farther Purification thereby, or in the <hi>Aura,</hi> (as is in Seing, which is the most Spiritual Sens) but only that it is a Standard between the Sensible Sound, and the Auditive Animal Spirits in the Nervs and Brain; and that all the Images therof being Potentialy in them (as all Parts and Members of the Body are in the Bloud, and all Sensible Sounds, as I said, in the Air) they are Irradiated, as I must so again term it, by them, and so pass through the Auditive Nervs to the Brain, as any Sound from the first Collision, at one end of a String stretched and held by the teeth at the other end, doth pass from one to the other; and so they are again Irradiated by the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, whereby the Sensation is performed: and the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth both Hear, and perceiv that it Hears, and so of the rest. And thus also, as I conceiv, when the Imagination doth Fansy, as we call it, that is, Contemplate Phantasms Actuated only by the Vegetative Spirit, at the Command, and by the Government therof, without any such Irradiation by the Sensible Object or <hi>Species,</hi> yet itself doth Irradiate them more or less; that is Animadvert, though commonly so feintly and transiently, that they are, as I said, only as Spectres of the <hi>Species,</hi> and pass away, as we say, as quick as Thought; becaus the Imagination, being a very Active Spirit, doth so pass from one to another; and it is not requisite that they should continue longer; but give place to others: and yet sometimes the Imagination is so Vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and doth so Intensly Irradiate them, that they are as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, as if they were Illustrated by the very Sensible Object, or <hi>Species</hi>; as in the Instance of the Firestick, and the like, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Object, and <hi>Species</hi> therof are removed, as I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and sometimes also more permanently and steadily, even as if the Phantasm were a Real Object, as in the Instance of him,

and in very great and sudden Fears and Frights, and the like, in others. Now the Understanding and Will of Man, though they be Classicaly of an higher Nature then Imagination, and Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,

yet they are all in the Region of Life, as I have said, and very Analogous in their Living Operations; and Conjunct in the Human <hi>Compositum,</hi> wherin the Intellective Spirit of Man doth Predominate, and as his Sensitive Spirit is Immediately Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, so it is also Subservient unto it; and as the Vegetative Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit doth Actuate the <hi>Species,</hi> and Phantasms, in the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which are Elementary, for the Imagination, which doth so Irradiate them Immediately for itself, and thereby Sens and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv them; so the Imagination doth also Actualy Irradiate its own Phantasms for the use and service of the Understanding, whereby they become the most Spiritual and fitt Objects ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: and then when the Understanding would Animadvert them, it doth farther Irradiate them by its own most Pure and Mental Light, as I may so term it, and thereby understand them Intellectively, and with all perceiv that it doth so understand; and as it doth thus behold Sensible Objects, so also becaus itself is an Intelligence, it hath Intellectual Notions, and <hi>Idea</hi>'s therof, and much more of itself and other Intelligible things, and can Reflect upon itself and its own Operations, and understand what they are, by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and higher Act: and so likewise Abstract from all Singulars, and Particulars, and Contemplate them in their Universal Natures; as from <hi>Album</hi> and all or any <hi>Alba</hi> Concretely it can Abstract <hi>Albedo,</hi> and so from <hi>Species</hi> their <hi>Genera,</hi> and from all <hi>Genera</hi> the <hi>Genus Generalissimum,</hi> which is <hi>Ens,</hi> or more Abstractedly <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity</hi> (wherof there can be no Sensible <hi>Species,</hi> Images, or Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasms, but only Intellectual <hi>Ideae</hi>) and therefore it hath a special Art, whereby it can Command and caus the Imagination in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way to represent such Signatures therof Sensibly, and which shall represent them Intelligibly to the Understanding; and that is <hi>per Verba Mentis,</hi> as we call them; for as in writing I make such Visible Letters, in Long-hand, or <hi>Characters</hi> in Short-hand, that are the Signatures of such Intelligible Sens and Meaning, which we call Words; or as we so Discours by Audible Voice and Articulate Sounds; so by these two Doctrinal Senses, or either of them, and by the Visible, or Audible Signatures therof in the Imagination, which the Understanding doth Irradiate, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by read or receiv them, it doth understand its own Intelligible Sens and Meaning, which it cannot so do without them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if the Brain be hurt or distempered, not only the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

Nor are either Sensitive or Intellective Souls all equal, but they have their Individual, and not only Numerical, Differences, as well as Specifical; as there is no <hi>Species</hi> wherof all the Indidual Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys are of one and the same Size exactly, (which might make an Universal Standard) becaus God and Nature do in all things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Variety, as I have shewed. Much less is there any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Understanding, or <hi>Intellectus Agens,</hi> which doth Illuminate or Irradiate all particular Understandings, but there is only (as I said of <hi>Anima Mundi</hi>) Intelligence Genericaly and Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicaly, which comprehends both Human and Angelical; wheras every Individual Angel, and Man, understands by his own Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Understanding; and as God breathed the Intellective Spirit into <hi>Adam,</hi> so he Created in it and with it his Intellective Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty whereby he did understand. Nor is there any other account to be given of Sensitive, or Intellective Notion, Perception, or Knowledg generaly, but that God hath so Created them, and made them to be such as they are, as I have already shewed; becaus their Substantial Spirits in themselvs are Simple Essences
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:61550:240"/>
Immediately Created by God, that is, Sensitive Spirits in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining, and afterward produced in the Fifth, and Sixth Days, and the Intellective Spirit of Man last of all, together with the production of his Sensitive Spirit, which is the most excellent of all Sensitives, as I have shewed: and so their Sensitive, and Intellective Facultys, also Created in and with them are Simple Accidents and Essences in themselvs, though their Operations are produced afterward by other Instrumentalitys in their <hi>Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi>; into which we may, and have thus farr inquired: and this Operation by <hi>Species,</hi> and Phantasms seemeth to differ from the Created Notions in the Facultys themselvs, as <hi>Nebuchadne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>'s Dream, when he had forgott it, did from the Revelation therof unto him by <hi>Daniel</hi> afterward; for so he had a Notion therof in himself before it was Reveled, otherwise he could not have known it again when it was Reveled; and yet he could not so Revele it to himself: as the Understanding cannot understand any such Notion, which it hath Immanently in itself, without the Signatures therof in and by the Imagination: yet the Innate Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons therof are not like his, which was Acquired before, nor in any strict sens such as they are called, <hi>Reminiscentiae</hi>; but Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately Created and Imprinted in the Understanding by God and Nature, without which it should not have been any Natural Understanding: nor is it only an <hi>Intellectus Patiens,</hi> but such as can Actively of itself, and by the Instrumentality of the Imagination, Operate, and Exert them, as I have shewed: and so they are more rightly termed Anticipations, or P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But as this is the First Notion, so the Second is the Knowledg of the Operation, or <hi>Scio quod Scio,</hi> or that I am an Intelligent Being, and so are more Remotely and Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentialy the other Operations of the Intellective Soul, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultys or Powers therof, such as are comprehended in one word, Rationality; which yet doth not properly express them all, as these Praenotions, and Faith, and the rest, and which it ought to Include as well as Reason; and though it might be so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Inclusive of them all, yet it is only of such Proper Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultys, which are Accidents, and not of the very Specifical Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the Soul, which is Substantial, and such as we know not, and therefore cannot know the Substance therof any more then we do the Substance of any other Spirits, or of Matter itself, that is, only by their Proper Accidents. Now as I thus know that I am, and that I am a Knowing Being, by a most Simple Apprehension, which is only of this Simple Enunciation, <hi>Ego Scio,</hi> (for so by the Egoity, as they term it, I know that I am, and that I am my self and none other; and by the <hi>Scio</hi> I know, that I am Knowing) so becaus I know, that I am not the first caus of my self, but a Finite Creature, who had a Begining of my Being, I know Rationaly by Immediate Deduction from it, that there is an Infinite first Caus of my Being, that is, God; and becaus I know that I am such an Intelligence, whereby I can thus know God my Creator, (whom therefore I know to be also my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server, and Governor) I know my Soul to be an Immortal Being, made for God himself and his own Glory, who is Eternal, and

will Eternaly recompence me according to my prepared Capacity of Mercy or Misery: and though these be indeed Ratiocinations by way of Argument, and not such Simple Enunciations, as the other; yet becaus they are such Intimate, Immediate, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Consequences, we also call them Common Notions, as they both indeed appear to be such, in all Nations, and all Ages of the World, and by the Vote of all Mankind, and all Civil Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys therof; and are both of them so Complicated, that he who denys one, will also de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And this I conceiv to be Reason; and thus God, as it is said, having sett the World in the Heart of Man, that is, an Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al World of Knowledg of all things Intelligible, and of their Natural Causalitys, and Effects, Analogys, Combinations, not only Singulars and Particulars, but also Universals, both Abstracted or Metaphysical, and Concrete or Homophysical, which is that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Notion or Knowledg, that I before mentioned to be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in his Intellective Faculty, he is thereby thus Instructed to Reason and Discours from Causes to Effects, or from Effects to Causes, and according to Natural Analogy, and the like; and to make Propositions of Singulars and Particulars by some Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Propositions, to which they are to be reduced, and the like. Again, as the Understanding of Man is an Intelligent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, so Created by God in and with his Soul, and hath such First and Common Notions Imprinted in it by him Originaly and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neraly, so God can more specialy by D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the Soul accordingly apprehending as true and evident as well as any others wherof it hath any such Innate Knowledg, it doth therefore Believ them, without any Ratiocination; and this kind of Knowledg is called Faith, wherof there is also a Natural Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity in the Soul; for God doth not so make a Stone, Tree, or Brute, to Believ, but only Men, or Angels. And though these be several ways of Knowledg, yet it is all one and the same Knowledg, which is Acquired thereby generaly, though of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Kinds; and the same Object may be known by all or any of these ways of Knowledg; as I know Intuitively, that I am, by a most Immediate Conscience of mine own Being, and yet I can also prove it to my self by my Operations, or any of them: and so I have proved that the World had a Begining, and yet as the Apostle saith, By Faith also we understand it. But Sensitives have only a Module of the Sensible World in their Souls, which they being Perceptive and Living <hi>Animals</hi> may also know in a Sensible maner, as I have shewed; and so it is possible by such Signatures, as I have said, to make them understand Sensible things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as Horses, Dogs, Baboons, Elephants, are taught by Signs, to do many strange feats, which seem very wonderfull, as indeed they are the hights of all Bestial Docility; but yet as they are not Intelligences themselvs, so neither can they apprehend any Intelligible things; as you cannot by any such Signes make them to apprehend God, or any Intelligence, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical, or Human; nor any Universal <hi>Species</hi> or <hi>Genus,</hi> and the like; nor any Universal Propositions, Connexions, or Conclusions, and the like; but only Sensible things, and of them only Singulars, or Particulars: neither do they Understand any thing, that is, apprehend any Sensible in an Intellective, but only in a Sensitive maner; for they cannot Intellectively Irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate their Phantasms, so as the Understanding doth, whereby farther to Purifie and Sublimate them, and so behold them In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectively with a Mental Light, as I have shewed: and I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose these two Differences in the Understanding, and the like proportionably in the Will, to be sufficient to Discriminate us from Beasts; and that we need not to deny them any Percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which they may have, that is, of any Sensibles, or in any Sensitive maner, lest they should seem too like unto Men, and come too neer us, who are thus Classicaly removed from them.
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:61550:242"/>
The Will of Man is most Connatural with his Understanding, and hath its Instincts, as I may so term them, as that hath its Praenotions; not only general, but special; and thus as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellective Soul first Knoweth itself, so it also first and most Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally Willeth itself, and all that belongs unto itself: and as it may Naturaly apprehend God by Deduction from itself, so it may Love him in order to itself, and also all other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligences and Moral Creatures: and so Man is <hi>Animal Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abile,</hi> and hath a Natural Affection in himself more or less to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward all other Men in order to himself, and therefore first and principaly to such as are neerest to himself, as Wife, Children, Kindred, Countrymen, and the like: which Natural Affections are all founded in that Original Institution of Matrimony, as I have shewed, and which is indeed the Fountain of all Familys, Nations, and the like. And upon the Foundations of these First Notions and Instincts, and the Immediate Consequences therof, are all Arts and Sciences as so many Superstructures built; which therefore are laid down as <hi>Principia,</hi> and <hi>Postula<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="456" facs="tcp:61550:243"/>
which is also according to the Natural Capacity therof, and not contrary unto it, though the Inclinations be so farr Supernatural. Again, as the Understanding cannot Operate without the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentality of the Imagination, so neither can the Will; for it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the <hi>Dictamen</hi> of the Understanding, and therefore Operates only with it and by it; and as the Imagination doth Spontaneously Perceiv, and the Appetite Perceptively Affect, so the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doth Voluntarily Understand, and the Will Understanding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Will: and though the Appetite and Will, after they are Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated by the Imagination and Understanding, can Executively Move their own Instruments; yet as the Appetite can only Move its own Motive Spirits, and thereby the Body, and so thereby other Bodys; so the Will of Man in this Conjunct State, using the Instrumentality of the Appetite, as the Understanding doth the Instrumentality of the Imagination, can only so Move by and with the Appetite. And as there are several other Facultys of the Imagination, as Judgment, Ingeny, Memory, and the like, and of the Appetite, as all the Affections, and the like; so there are such Analogous Qualitys, not only in Human, but also in Angelical Understanding, and Will; becaus, as I said, they are all within the Region of Life; and these are Living Facultys, and such without which Life should not be Life generaly, that is, a Knowledg of what they do, with a Delight in suitable Objects and Operations, and Abhorrence of the contrary; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is Life, and is by this double Operation, or Super-operation of the Living <hi>Animal</hi> upon its own Operations, as I have often said, wherof no Inferior Nature is capable; and therefore, as I said, Vegetatives do not thus Live, and much less Elements, or Matter: for though they also Operate more or less, and by those Principles, which the most Wise and Powerfull Creator hath Imprinted in their Natures, can produce such Constant, Regular, and Oeconomical effects, in their Simple Operations accordingly, yet they cannot Perceiv or Review their own Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, nor have any Sentiment, or Enjoiment therof, as Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitives, and Intellectives, which are Living <hi>Animals</hi>; but are as the Dead Carcass of the World, wherof these only are the Living Spirits: and thus Sensitives live a Sensitive, and Intellectives an Intellective Life. Now though we do not know, nor will I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume particularly to declare, the way and maner of Angelical
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:61550:243"/>
Operations; yet generaly, as I know that they are Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, or such Intellective Lives, so I know they have Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and Will, and all the Analogy of Life, which the Scripture most plainly declareth unto us; and much more that they are Creatures or Created Natures as well as others; and that they are no such <hi>Dii Minores,</hi> as Platonists, and some Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonical Christians, would make them: and though they be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material, and most Spiritual of any Spirits, yet they are only Spirits Genericaly, as others, and are no such Phantasms and Spectres, as Scholemen would make them; nor so wholy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned in the Matter, and the Univers of all Common Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Entity, and Finite Bounds therof, which God hath sett to all Substantial Beings, and to all Quantitys, and Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys therof; wherefore they can no more ascend above the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, then descend below the Center of the wstole Globe of the World; becaus there is no <hi>Vbi,</hi> or Locality, beyond it; and Locality is a Common Accident, or Affection of all Created Beings, as well as Time, and Number (and certein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no Angel is Elder then he is, or more then One) nor can they Nullify or Evacuate the Nature of Extension, Density, or Gravity, so as they should not be more or less such to them, as they are in themselvs, and as well as they are unto all others, as I have shewed. But as we may conceiv by all other Spirits what they are, that is, Substantial Activitys; so we must also acknowledge Angels to be the most Spiritual of all Spirits; and though, according to the Oeconomy of Universal Nature, they are concerned in the Matter, or Body of the World, as well as others; yet neither are they so Immersed as Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, nor Rooted as Vegetative, nor United as Sensitive, nor Confined therin as Human Spirits are; which can neither Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, Will, nor Move themselvs, otherwise then by the Instrumentalitys of their Bodily part in this Conjunct State, as I have shewed: for though Angels also are parts of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Oeconomy of the World, as I said, yet they have their own Private and Individual Oeconomy wholy in themselvs, and need none other Instrumentalitys, whereby to perform their own Operations Immanently, and they can also Transiently Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate upon all others in a most Powerfull and Wonderfull ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: but as they are Spiritual Substances, so they have their

and so present them to the Imagination; which yet may Animadvert, or not, as it pleaseth, becaus it is Spontaneous; also they may Actuate the <hi>Species</hi> Immediately in the Animal Spirits, and present them to the Imagination so strongly and vehemently, that they may seem thereby to appear unto us in any Visible shape, or to utter any Audible Voice, or the like: and they may stirr up Bodily Humors within us, and the Motive Spirits, and Fluxes or Refluxes therof, to temp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now though they cannot force us to Animadvert their Tentations, and much less Incline our Wills, yet this is a very large and wide entrance, which they may thus have into our Souls; but though I suppose that they have so now generaly, yet I also conceiv, that they could not invade Man in his first Creation; (as <hi>Adam</hi> was restrained from eating of the forbidden fruit,) and also that they cannot now invade us, or our Lives and Estates, (as otherwise gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raly they might) being restrained by the Divine Power, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the Divine Command, as <hi>Satan</hi> himself told God, that he had made an Hedg about <hi>Iob,</hi> and his hous, and all that he had, on every side; and he could not infest him, untill, nor any farther, then he afterward obteined Licens from God: and I conceiv, that ordinarily God doth suffer him to tempt great Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, who give themselvs up unto him and his Government; and so God suffred a Lying Spirit to seduce <hi>Ahab,</hi> and his fals Prophets, and the Divel entred into <hi>Iudas,</hi> and the like: And thus Witches by their Invocations, and others by their Execratio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and thus, as I said, Man was constituted Lord over the Works of his hands, and made Gods Viceroy heer on Earth, by a most Lawfull and Natural Sovereignty; and accordingly God hath Crowned him with Glory and Honor, and Invested him with Roial Power; both in his Mind, which is more Politike and Prudent, and more Ingenious and Mechanical, then any Brutes,
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:61550:246"/>
and also in his Body, which is of an Erect and Sublime Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and of a more Excellent Temper and Organism, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aly his Hands, whereby he can Use and Manage any other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments farr otherwise, and to more advantage, then they: and as Man is <hi>Animal Politicum,</hi> so Mankind by Conjunct Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Power doth Subdue all Wild Beasts, and Nations of Brutes. But the Intellective Spirit of Man is a more Special Image of God in itself, as it is an Intelligence, and hath in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self an <hi>Idea</hi> of Divinity, and a Capacity of Loving and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying God, wherof all Inferior Natures are Incapable; and indeed we may justly admire how a Finite Intellect should be in any maner capable of apprehending Infinite, or of having any Communion or Conversation with God, who is Infinite: and this our very Subordination unto him is farr higher then our Sovereignty over all Inferior Creatures; which, as they were made to Serv us, so also to Demonstrate and declare his Glory, shining in them, unto us, who as Gods Stewards should gather in all the Revenues therof from them, and Immediately return it unto himself: wheras their Immediate Goodness and Perfection is thus to be Subordinate unto Man, who by his more Divine Contemplations, and Lawfull Use of them, and his Glorifyng of God the Creator thereby, doth Sanctify them; and by his own Immediate Knowledg, Love, and Enjoyment of God his Creator, is himself as it were Deified; and indeed this is the true Spiritual Image of God in the Soul, which is the highest Exaltation therof, and such a Sublime Mystery, as well deserveth a more particular Explication. And first we must know, that the Knowledge, and Love of God, as God, must be above the Knowledge, or Love of our very Self; becaus God is Infinitely above us; not only in himself, but in Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto us, as he is our Creator, and we his Creatures; whereby we are made wholy Subordinate unto him, and not he unto us: wherefore to Know or Love him in order to our Self, is no true Knowledg or Love of God, as God, but Blasphemy, and Impiety: and yet, as I have shewed, Self is Naturaly the Begining of all our Knowledg, and End of all our Love, and no Man Naturaly can Know, or Love God, otherwise then in order to himself; which is to make Self his God, or his Chief and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, and God only to be Subordinate therunto: nor can any

Nature whatsoever Naturaly of itself ascend above itself (as Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cannot ascend above its Levell) otherwise Self should be more then Self, which is Impossible. Now wheras the Law of God commandeth us to Exalt him above ourselvs, and to Love him with all our <hi>Valde,</hi> in such a Transcendent and Supernatural ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, we must also conceiv, that he doth not command Impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys; but that there is a Natural Capacity in our Soul of being thus Exalted above our Natural Self, which must be by a Supernatural Power so Exalting us; and becaus it is the Exaltation of our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellective Understanding, and Will, therefore it must not be only a Passive or Receptive Capacity, but with a most Conscious Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and Freedom of Will; by a Revelation of the Light of the Object, and also by an Illumination of the Sight of the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and not only by a Moral Perswasion, but also by a Divine Exaltation of the Will. And thus Man, being made such an Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Creature, had a Natural Capacity of being so Exalted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God; and becaus it was most Congruous that this Capacity should be filled and completed, in, and with the very Creation of his Soul, which was made for this very End, and which, if it had not atteined, God had made it in vain, and so it had been made, though not Sinfull, yet Monstrous, and not Perfect and Good, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is said expresly, that he thus Created Man in his own Image, that is, this Image of Holines, as well as in other respects; and as I have shewed, how every other Nature is Exalted by a <hi>Melior Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura,</hi> which is Superior unto it, in the Scale of Nature; as Matter by Elementary Spirits, and they by Vegetative, and they by Sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and the Sensitive Spirit of Man by his Intellective; so is his Intellective Spirit also Exalted by the Divine Spirit of God his Creator; and as the Animal Spirits in his Body are so many times Refined and Sublimated to that hight as to be fitt Instruments of his Intellective Spirit, by the Irradiation therof; so is the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and Will of Man, thus Sublimated by the Irradiation of the Divine Spirit: and as the Understanding, and Will of Man, when he was first Created, did Perfectly Command and Rule his Imagination and Appetite, and they did also Perfectly Obey, with their own Natural Perception, and Spontaneity; so was the Soul of Man first Created thus Obedient and Conformable to the Divine Spirit, most Knowingly and Willingly, with its own Natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellection and Volition: and thus, as it is said, <hi>God made Man Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,</hi>

And this is that which the Scripture commonly calls Flesh, as it is opposed to the Divine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the Supernatural Work therof in the Soul; and so those two are said to be contrary one unto another; and not only diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent (so as the Corporeal Flesh of a Sensitive Body is distinguished from the Sensitive Spirit, and so is termed the Flesh of Beasts, Birds, or Fishes; nor as the whole Sensitive <hi>Compositum</hi> is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times distinguished from Intelligences, as it is said, that Horses are <hi>Flesh, and not Spirit</hi>), but as the whole Human <hi>Compositum,</hi> both in the Sensitive, and Intellective part therof, is now Naturaly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to the Divine Spirit, as I have shewed: and so, the Apostle saith, <hi>The Natural Man</hi> (or the Animal Man Naturaly) <hi>receiveth not the things that are of God, for they are Foolishnes unto him; neither can he know them,</hi> (or conceiv and receiv them) <hi>becaus they are Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualy discerned.</hi> And all this may most plainly appear by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation of this Divine Image by the Spirit of God, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>New Creature,</hi> and <hi>New Man, which is renewed in Knowledg after the Image of him that Created him:</hi> though I do not suppose it to be by any Proper Creation of any new Faculty, or Power in

And in this respect it is somwhat more, that it requires a Conjunct Irradiation of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit continualy (as the Diaphanous Air doth of the Light and Heat of the Sun) which is wholy Supernatural.

Now according to all my former Discourses, it is not, nor can it be any Question, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all Spirits whatsoever, Elementary, Vegetative, or Sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, as well as Matter, be Immortal in their own Simple Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Substances, and Specifical Natures; for they, as such, are Ingenerable, and were Properly Created; and therefore cannot be Corrupted, and shall not be Annihilated: but as their <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posita</hi> were first Improperly Created, or Originaly Generated, and so are Successively Generable, they are also Corruptible;
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:61550:249"/>
and so undeniably the Intellective Spirit, as it is one Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Principle of the Human <hi>Compositum,</hi> is also Incorruptible, or Immortal. Again, as it is no Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

(out of which again, not the same Individual and Oeconomical Spirit, but another in a new <hi>Compositum</hi> may be Generated) which is the Corruption or Mortality therof; and such new production ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Generation. Now that the Intellective Soul of Man is not so Mortal or Corruptible, but Immortal and Incorruptible, is the purport of the whole Scripture; becaus, as I said, it is a Fundamental Point of Religion; and whosoever believs Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be the Word of God, may not, nor can he deny it; but he who will deny the one, must first deny the other; that is, that the Scripture is the Word of God.

But, as I said, I shall rather prove the Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of our Souls Moraly, by that Argument of <hi>Plato,</hi> which is very Rational and Philosophical, and may be farther improved by Christianity. Certeinly God the Creator and First Caus of all things is also the utmost End therof; and he is Immediately served only by Angels and Men, becaus they are Immediately Subordinate to him, and the only Intelligences in Nature, which only have any Conscience or Conusance of him; and therefore can only perform that Immediate and Spiritual Service, which he requireth, and which is fitt and Proper for him who is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and will be so worshiped: and so, as I said, they were Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and appointed to gather in all the Revenues of his Glory, and to render it to himself, as well as to Glorify him by their other Personal Services: Wherefore if these Intelligences should perish or ceas to be in their Personal Individualitys, though their Substantial Principles might not ceas to be, but be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded or Coagulated as others, yet becaus they should not so any longer continue to be the same Persons (as no <hi>Compositum,</hi> when it is once Dissolved, doth Naturaly return again to be the same) but their Personalitys should so be destroied; then it should be all one, in respect to this great and utmost End of Creation, as if they had never been Created: for as if God had Rested from all his Works after the Fourth Day, and before any Sensitives were produced, and neither they, nor Angels or Men had been Created, all the other Creation had been void and vain in respect to itself, as I have shewed; becaus there had been no Spectators to Perceiv or Enjoy it, so if Sensitives also had been produced, they could only Behold and Enjoy the Creation, but not render any Glory therof unto God the Creator, of whom they are wholy Ignorant; and so all of them had been made in vain, becaus none of them could attein the very End of Creation,
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:61550:250"/>
which is the Glory of the Creator: and though they had so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to be for ever, yet the very End of their Being had been Nullified; yea though they were made Perfect and Good in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs, yet they had not been Sanctified or Sublimated to any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Use or Service, nor could God have so pronounced of them all, that they were Very Good; nor would he have so Rested un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he had so reduced them all to himself, and his own Glory; nor Instituted such a Sabbath of Spiritual Rest, wherin he did Review and Rejoice in all the Works which he had wrought, and from which he received the Emanant Reflections of his own Inherent Glory, according to the utmost Capacity of Finite Nature: Thus also if the Intelligent Natures of Angels, or Men, should be Mortal, then all the Manifestations of his Glory to them, or by them, should with themselvs ceas and Vanish away; and wheras they also do Personaly manifest his Divine Honor, or otherwise Dishonor him, so he, who is the Great King, according to his Roial Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and Goodnes will recompens them with Reward, or Punishment, wherunto Piety and Impiety, Virtue and Vice, do Moraly Relate; and in the Distribution of his Mercy and Justice accordingly his Everlasting Kingdom of Glory doth consist: and therefore also all his Subjects therof must be Immortal; otherwise after they had thus Served or Disserved him, they should Escape him, and lose their Rewards or Punishments, and he the Glory therof: for so the same Man or Angel should ceas to be, and the Name of his Person, as it stands in Gods Book, be O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Though it is true, that all Men, and all the Angels in Heaven, or Divels in Hell, can add nothing to, or diminish from Gods Uncreated Glory, which he Eternaly Enjoieth in himself, and which is Immutable as Himself; nor was the World made for any such End, but for the Created Manifestation therof, which accordingly as they do Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, or Eclips, by serving him, or sining against him, so he also according to his Created or Reveled Law of Justice will most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinly Retribute unto them. And this Moral and Political Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is very much inforced by the consyderation of Gods present Providence and Administration, which is as the Political <hi>Chaos</hi> of the World Future, and seemeth to be as Inane and Inform; and yet out of it will he produce all the Beauty and Glory of the other World.

And I am so confident of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Conviction of this Argument (which as I said is a Common Notion, deduced from the Immediate Knowledg of the Nature of our Intellective Soul, and of God our Creator, Preserver, and Governor, collated together) that no mans Conscience can outface it, but only his, who doth not, or will not regard it: and unless such who can deny all Polity of Nature, and the Subordination of all Inferior Na ures to Man, can also be so Impious as to deny the Immediate Subordination of Men and Angels to God their Creator, I do not see how they can evade it; which if they can, they do also thereby elude all Religion and Worship of God. Nor are Sensible Experiments wanting, though I will not offer any Direct Testimony therof to such who can deny Divine Authority, and from whom therefore I may not reasonably expect, that they should believ any Human Reports or Records of the Survivorship of the Souls of men after Death: and <hi>If they will not hear Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be perswaded, though one rose from the Dead</hi>: and should tell them this very thing, that he hath rose from the Dead: but I shall therefore rather offer another common Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment among the Living, from which I shall deduce a Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral Evidence of this Truth: and that is Self-murder in Man, and in none other Inferior <hi>Animals,</hi> who will not so destroy themselvs, Perceptively, and Spontaneously, and being in no <hi>Delirium,</hi> but in sound Health, and Strength of Body, as Man very often doth most Wittingly and Willingly, and with the greatest and most sedate Deliberation. Now as I have before shewed, Self is such a First Principle and Fundamental Interest in Nature, that as Nature generaly, so all particular Natures, do intend and endeavor to the utmost the preservation therof; nor can it by any Natural Power of Compulsion, or Perswasion, be removed from this most Innate Principle and Instinct, (except only for preservation of the Universal Nature, which is also Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural in order to the necessary preservation of its own Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Nature, as a Fox will bite off his Leg to preserv his Life)
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:61550:251"/>
for if any thing could be ousted of this most Natural Principle, then it should be ousted of itself: wheras Self is the Foundation of all other Concernments. Thus a Lion, Mastiff, Bear, Boar, Hors, or any other most stout and couragious Brute, will ly whin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and pining to the last, rather then destroy itself, or suffer itself to be destroied by others, untill Death necessarily dissolv it; becaus it is Conscious to itself, and hath this Common Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in itself, that the Individuality therof, which truly and realy is the very Self therof, shall perish for ever: wheras Man, having this Common Notion of the Immortality of his Soul Imprinted in his Soul (which principaly is himself, as Hebraicaly the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Person is called a Soul, and as it is said <hi>Animus cujus<expan>

And though I believ this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Immortality of the Soul (as also the other, that there is a God) to be Explicitely Exerted and Exercised by few, yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinly they are both Implicitely Radicated in the Minds of all men, which Renders their Lives and Conversations such, as if sometimes, and in some respects, they did seem so to believ, and at other times, and in other respects as if they did not; and it may appear so to be in themselvs, and to themselvs, in that they have such a continual strife and endeavor to cast and keep these Opinion out of their Minds, which is commonly done either by not regarding, or resolving against them, wherof the very fear or doubtfull apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, which no Brute can have, doth approve to the Soul itself what it may expect; and which, if men begin at any time to think ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, will return upon them; though some more learned, study to confute themselvs by Contrary Opinions, and that they may make way for the denial of the Immortality of the Soul, therefore also deny all Separate Spirits both of Men, and Angels Good, and Bad; as the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> and others, with <hi>Epicurus,</hi> deny all Inferior Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits whatsoever; hudling all things and themselvs together in the common Matter; which is such a Physical Libertinism, as though it may gratifie us at present, yet is indeed no less then the Eternal Self-murder of the Soul. And so likewise others, though they will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce all Spiritual Substances to the gross Matter, yet affirm their Soul to be only <hi>Pars Animae Mundi,</hi> as they term it; into which, when it
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:61550:252"/>
dieth, it returns again, as into another Spiritual <hi>Chaos</hi>: and so though the Substance remain therin, Confounded and Coagulated with others, yet the Personality and Individuality therof is thereby Corrupted and destroyed, like the Sensitive Spirits of Brutes; which is only another more subtle Denial of the Immortality therof, that is, of the very Individuality and Personality of every Human Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as I have shewed. Wherefore becaus they cannot deny the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the Soul Absolutely, they thus deny the same Personal future Condition therof, and any such Intensive, or Extensive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, or Punishments, in Heaven, or Hell; which to mitigate and moderate, they have invented and appointed a Transmigration for all Souls into better or wors Bodys after Death, accordingly as they have behaved themselves while they Lived in the former: Whereas they must also affirm, that they are still Human Spirits, which are so detruded into Brutes, or Vegetative Bodys; as the Poets plainly do acknowledg, and so the Man in the Buck would have said to his Hounds and Huntsmen, <hi>Actaeon ego Sum</hi>—as the Tree did to <hi>Aeneas, Nam Polydorus ego</hi>—which yet certeinly is contrary to all Philosophy and Nature: for every Specifical Spirit must have its own proper Organical Body; and if any of the more Noble and Necessary Parts of its own Body, while it Lives in it, be Discontinued, Dissocated, or Disordered, it will Live no longer in it; much less could the Human Spirit of <hi>Actaeon</hi> Live in a Buck, or of <hi>Polydorus</hi> in a Tree; for Bodys are nor only Vehicles of the Spirits, but Domicils, and Officines, as I have shewed; and as Sensitive Spirits cannot Live in any other besides their own Element, so much less can they, or the Intellective Spirit of Man, live in any other then their own proper Bodys, which are therefore so Effigiated and Formed for them by their proper Vegetative Spirits, as I have also shewed. Or if they could be Transpeciated into other Sensitive or Vegetative Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, then their Substances being so Specificaly changed, their Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Qualities, and all their <hi>Ideae,</hi> and Notions subsisting therin, must also be changed, and al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And that the Separate State of the Soul is such, may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what Sensibly appear in our selvs, who seem to have some Common Notion therof Imprinted in our very Souls; which made the Heathen Philosophers so much complain of the Prison of their Body, and Bondage of this Conjunct State, as expecting a better afterward.

as may particularly appear by a short Recapitulation of what we have formerly discoursed. Thus first we have proved a Begining, and consequently a Creation of the World; which no Heathen Philosophy so understood, as it is declared by God in his Word; but either imagined an Eternal Creation without a Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in any certein Time, removing it perpetualy backward by sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of many Deluges, Conflagrations, and general Devastati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Indefinite Revolutions: or though they may sometimes seem to acknowledg an Improper Creation from some precedent Principles of Matter, Atoms, <hi>Mens, Anima Mundi, Ideae,</hi> and the like; yet they do not express any Proper Creation from Absolute Nonentity, to which Heathen Philosophy never did subscribe; nor do I know any Word in any other Human Language, but only Hebraical, which doth import such a Proper Creation. Though if any conceiv otherwise, and can collect any such Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from their doubtful, and confused, and sometimes contrary, Sentences, I shall not hinder him from subjoining their Human Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony to Divine Authority. But certeinly <hi>Moses</hi> doth most plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and clearly affirm a Creation of the World, in a certein Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and so proceeds to declare the first Age of the World as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly and expresly, as if himself had been Contemporary, and lived in the same Time and Places; and the Affairs therof, (which all Heathen Historiographers esteemed Fabulous, and termed <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gygia</hi>) more exactly and truly then they do relate the Transactions of later Ages. And thus wheras other Nations dated their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings so many years <hi>ab Urbe Condita,</hi> or in such an Olympiad, or the like; the Jews, both antient and modern, date them, <hi>ab Orbe condito.</hi> Nor is the whole Age of the World so very large or vast, but that every man may according to Divine Chronology easily comprehend it: And indeed there are not probably above 150 Generations between us and <hi>Adam,</hi> who was the Common Ancestor of all Mankind: for the Scripture doth exactly enumerate them all from the first <hi>Adam</hi> to the Second; that is to <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>

that the Mind of Man may comprehend it, and by the Light of the Divine Word look through it as a transparent Globe: for so it is said, <hi>He hath set the World in their Heart</hi>; and his Word plainly sheweth us how all Generable and Corruptible things were first educed out of a <hi>Chaos</hi> of Potentialitys, wherin all their Primitive and Simple Essences were then latent; and brought forth most or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and successively in Six Days, by God who Created them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by a Proper Creation from Absolute Nothing, in a Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral maner by Improper Creation; which was their Original Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration then Instituted by God himself, and by his Divine Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction so continuing Successively: And this is a short, plain, and evident account therof; wheras others, instead of such Proper and Improper Creation, have imagined a <hi>Potentia Materiae,</hi> or Power in the Matter of producing out of itself other Active Substances farr more excellent then itself; which yet were not before Realy in it; or that the Matter is transpeciated and converted into them: though an Angel, who is the chief Being in the Scale of Nature, cannot so produce out of himself any other then his own proper Qualitys and Accidents, nor can he Realy transmute himself, or be converted into any other Inferior Nature whatsoever; and much less can Matter, which is the lowest and basest of all others, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert itself, or be coverted into any Superior Nature. Certeinly that which they so affirm to be <hi>in Potentia,</hi> must be either <hi>Ens,</hi> or <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens,</hi> while it is so <hi>in Potentia</hi>; and if it be <hi>Nonens,</hi> then <hi>Non est in Potentia</hi> (as I have shewed of Vacuity) and if it be <hi>Ens,</hi> then as I have said it is also an Entity Created by God in its Potentiality, or <hi>Chaos,</hi> and so produced by Natural Generation into Actuality; as if Vacuity could be any <hi>Ens,</hi> then it must also be Created by God, or Concreated with the World, and should not be before, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond, nor any where out of the Created World, and Body of the Matter therof, as others have vainly supposed of such an Imaginary Space, Nor is their <hi>Forma Misti,</hi> or <hi>Compositi,</hi> any other thing then the Result of the very Mistion and Composition of those Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive and Simple Entities, according to their own Natural Coor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations and Subordinations in the Scale of Nature, which God hath so erected and ordered, that they have in themselvs all the Natural Principles therof, and an Aptitude and Appetite to be so Mist and Composited in all Successive Generation, according to that Law of Original Generation: and therefore Forms are no such

And the Air, which is Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaly an <hi>Expansum,</hi> cannot be Naturaly a <hi>Compressum,</hi> whereby in its own Element, or Atmosphere, it should Naturaly seek to expand itself more, and thereby Elasticaly press, as some would have it: Also both Aether and Air are called Heavens, as one is the Fountain and Immediate <hi>Medium</hi> of Aethereal Light, and the other the Vehicle, and Immediate <hi>Medium</hi> of Sight; and so I suppose, that Air doth Refract, or Reflect, very little, nor are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Objects in the Air, nor Starrs in the Aether, thereby seen In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tersected and Inverted, as through a Convex <hi>Lens</hi> in the Air, nor so much magnified and distended, as Divers see Objects in the <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> of Water. Again in this Second Days Work, <hi>Moses</hi> declareth Vapors in the Air to be only Waters above; and thereby intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Special Instrumentality therof in Nature; for so indeed Vapor is almost as Chymical an Instrument, as Fire. Nor yet doth he affirm these Waters to be above all the three Heavens, or any of them, as some suppose; but only in, or upon, or all over, that Heaven wherof he treateth in this Second Days Work; or more Criticaly, as it is Originaly, from above; and certeinly we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not suppose any Water to descend from above, but only that whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nor is this ascent of Vapors the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary and only caus of Winds, wherof we have no mention in the Creation; and if any Wind then were, it was probably some very tender and gentle breath, but greater Winds and Storms, which are effects of the Curs, are also caused by grosser Vapors; which whether moist, or dry, are not Formaly the very Wind; for

And in the Third Days Works, he shews, how wonderfully God formed and prepared the <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nor doth he affirm Vegetatives to Live; but, as I have observed, plainly distinguisheth between Vegetative and Sensitive Spirits, which he afterward calleth Living Souls. And in the description of the Works of the Fourth Day, we find none of those Monsters and Figments, which both Poetry and Philosophy have introduced in the Starry Heaven: for neither doth he divide it into Spheres, having plainly shewed before how the whole Aether was only one Sphere, as well as the other Heavens; nor indeed can such several Imaginary Spheres solv the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the Motions of Ae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But however those Vapors which she causeth do not make that whole Body of Water which floweth and refloweth in Tides; nor doth every part of that whole Body of Water pass to the extremitys of the Floud and Ebb; but only the Rivers in their Fall above the Floud of the Sea are sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by the Vapors, which causeth the Impuls of the whole Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulating Body of Water, as farr as the Ebb; like the two Handles of a Saw, in sawing forward and backward, not very farr, though the Saw be never so long: for plainly the Waters in the Floud to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Rivers are not much more Salt, nor in the Ebb toward the Ocean much more Fresh, but in the middle, where they meet, and where a proportionable overplus of the River Water so caused by the Vapors doth mingle with the Seawater. Also he plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timateth, that as some of the Luminarys are manifestly Motive, so they are all, in that he doth not distinguish between them: and it is elswhere expressly said of the Starrs generaly, that they militate in their Courses, or Originaly, Paths: and if the Fixed Starrs do move Uniformly together (which is the last <hi>Residuum</hi> of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Error and Opinion of their Fixation) yet however, according to their Various Positions in the Aether, they must move Difformly in Time, in that very Uniformity in Position; and either in Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Motion, or both, they are all Asymmetrous: certeinly no known Motion of any of them is Commensurable with the Motion of the whole Aether, according to which we assigne the Prope<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And though many of them be farr greater then the Earth, yet they all move about it, becaus they were made to give Light upon it, which they could not do at such a distance, unless they were so great.

Nor doth <hi>Moses</hi> lay any foundation of Judicial Astrology, which is expressly condemned by Scripture. Again in the Works of the Fifth and Sixth Day he describeth the Original Generations of Fishes, Fowls, and Beasts, and most truly termeth them Living, and afterward calleth their Bloud the Bloud of Life, which our Learned Doctor hath lately discovered to be a most proper expression, and citeth that Text in confirmation of his Discovery; wheras formerly the Heart was termed <hi>Primum vivens, &amp; ultimum moriens</hi>: I have been informed by a Physician my Neighbor, that having dissected an old Toad so farr as that he had taken out the Heart, and afterward stepping aside, before he returned again, the Toad had crept away into his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, where he found it a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And I shall desire any Naturalist seriously to consyder this Natural Representation of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> as he is thus the Infinite Completion and Consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Nature itself, and Perfection of the Univers, and so the Mediator both of Creation, and Redemption; that thereby God the Creator <hi>might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in Heaven, and which are in Earth, even in him</hi>: for so indeed <hi>Christ</hi> hath united in himself not only the Intellective Spirit of Man, but also his Body, yea the very Matter therof; as it is said, <hi>In him dwelleth all the fulnes of the Godhead Bodily.</hi> Wherefore all men should confes and acknowledg <hi>Without controversy great is the

Certeinly <hi>Thales, Pythagoras, Plato,</hi> and others, who purposely travelled into <hi>Egypt</hi> to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in their Learning, brought back none such into <hi>Greece:</hi> and I suppose, that whatsoever the antient <hi>Egytian</hi> Wisedom or Learning was, they received it first from <hi>Ioseph</hi> and the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> as other Nations since from <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Iews</hi>; though indeed they seem only to have received or reteined some scattered No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Fragments, or <hi>Cento's</hi> therof, mingling them with their own Fansys and Errors; which doth also plainly appear in all Pagan Theology. But as our Savior said, even untill his time; <hi>Salvation is of the Iews</hi>; so also was their Philosophy derived from this Fountain of Divine Truth, either by Scripture, or Tradition: for Language and Letters are the Vehicles of all that Human Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which we therefore call Literature; and undoubtedly the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language was the first and Original, and it is said ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly, that before the Confusion, <hi>the whole Earth was of one Language,</hi> which was Hebraical, as is proved by the <hi>Hebrew</hi> names of <hi>Adam, Chevah, Sheth,</hi> and the rest; and so also it is said, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

from him, the <hi>Iews</hi> who were of that Linage, were called <hi>Hebrews,</hi> as <hi>Abraham</hi> their Father is therefore called an <hi>Hebrew.</hi> Thus as <hi>Noah,</hi> and his Family only, were preserved from the common De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, so <hi>Heber,</hi> and his family only, were preserved from the common Confusion of Languages: and with the Original Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, the Original Knowledg which was delivered from their Ancestors, did continue in that Family; and probably the rest of Mankind, with the Language, lost also all those acquired Notions and Terms, or at least could make no common use therof for want of a common Language; and so in Scripture we read of no great Actions performed by those mighty Builders in many years after: and they are said to have been thereby scattered over all the Earth; wherof such who were neerest to <hi>Heber,</hi> in <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea,</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> began to learn again both Language and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg from him; as may appear by their very litle different D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

or <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> I should willingly accept it, if the Wisest of men had not assumed that Title, wherof I am not worthy to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take. However from this <hi>Specu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As first the <hi>Iews</hi> themselvs, after the Captivity, being mingled among the Heathen, learned their works, and the very Corruptions and Prevarications of that D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Truth, which the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as I have shewed, before bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> in respect of whom all other Nations might be rightly termed Barbarous. And from this <hi>Colluvies</hi> flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all their Sects of <hi>Sadduces, Pharisees,</hi> and others, and that Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binical Philosophy, which hath perverted the Simplicity of the Text by Cabbalistical and Allegorical Interpretations: and as they make all Scripture such, becaus some parts therof, as the Visions of Prophets are indeed Allegorical, so others would Interpret them also Literaly as in the Vision of the New <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus it is described Quadrate or Square Hieroglyphicaly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the Immobility therof, some have fansied the Superaether not to be Spherical; though they might as well affirm it to be Metalline or Gemmeous, and of no larger extent then accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Measure of so many Furlongs. But Philosophers have subverted the very foundation, and laid several others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead therof: and yet most Christians will build upon them, rather then acquiesce in the only true and Divine Philosophy: though I also acknowledg, that if others be reduced to this fundamental System of the World, very much Natural Knowledg may be gained from them, and that they may help to make a fair Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstructure. Nor have I laid down any <hi>Theses</hi> which I do not prove not only by Authority of Scripture, but also by Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Reason, and Sensible Experiment; and if any dissent from me, I shall also desire him to oppugn me with all the same Weapons, and as solid and firm; for if they be feint and feeble, they will bend and recoil on him that useth them. As in that famous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy concerning the Motion of the Earth, if any should urge against me that Text, <hi>which shaketh the Earth out of her place, and the Pillars therof tremble,</hi> I should answer him, that if I wanted a Text to prove the contrary Truth, this alone might suffice: for both by it, and the Context, it plainly appears, that it is spoken of a violent Commotion of the Earth by God in his anger, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:61550:262"/>
imports that otherwise the Earth Naturaly resteth, and hath a Place of Rest. And so their chief Reason to prove the Earth Mobile becaus it is Magnetical (which I have grant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d) doth as plainly prove the Immobility therof, as I have shewed. And the Sensible Experiment of an Arrow shot upright in a Ship sailing, is a meer Fallacy; though the Motion of the Ship, and of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher in it, while he dischargeth it, may indeed caus some little Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puls that way, in the very discharge, which so directeth it. But certeinly no man can believ that a Fly removing from an Horses head in travelling doth follow him with any less <hi>Nisus</hi> or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, by reason of any such Conjunct Motion, then another Fly which freshly pursues the Hors; for let an Hors that hath been washed in a River run swiftly on the Land, certeinly the Drops that fall from him will not follow him. There are many such fond Opinions and foolish Probations, which serv only to render Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy ridiculous. I am more confident of my <hi>Theses,</hi> and hope I have offered no such <hi>Hypotheses</hi>; but whatsoever they are, I sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to the several Masters in the respective Arts and Sciences; and generaly all to learned Divines, whose complete Province it is also to inspect this Divine Philosophy, which God himself hath laid as the Foundation of Theology: and as he doth delight to intitle himself the Maker of Heaven and Earth, so <hi>Ieremy</hi> taught the Captive Jews that Chaldaike Sentence, <hi>The Gods that have not made the Heavens and the Earth, even they shall perish from the Earth, and from under these Heavens,</hi> to discriminate the only true God from all Idols: nor do I remember that any Heathenish Religion did ever ascribe the Creation of the World to any of them, nor indeed acknowledg any Proper Creation. Wherefore since Errors in Philosophy are so dangerous in Divinity, Theologists should affect the <hi>Genesis</hi> of Creation, as well as the <hi>Exodus</hi> of Redemption: as all the Sects of Graecian Philosophers did joyn Natural with Moral Philosophy. Certeinly Theology only can teach us the right use and improvement of Natural Knowledg, that is, to Glorifie God, and benefit Mankind: and doth specialy admonish us that we should not so highly prize Curious and Costly <hi>Perierga,</hi> or any vain Philosophy or Knowledg which only puffeth, and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth not: for indeed whosoever doth terminate in a Speculative Contemplation of the World, is as much a Worldling, as any Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, Covetous, or Voluptuous men, who seek a satisfaction therin.</p>

Let all men therefore prais and glorify their Creator, who hath made this whole World, and all things therin, in Order, Measure, and Weight; not only in all their own particular Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but in the Univers, and Polity therof, since every man is himself a Created Module, and <hi>Idea</hi> both of the Creation, and of God the Creator; who as a <hi>Melior Natura,</hi> was made to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent God to all Inferior Creatures in his Dominion over them, and them unto God in his Immediate Subordination unto him: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as all the Works of God do prais him with the <hi>Echo</hi> of his own Goodnes, and the whole Globe as a Cymbal doth sound forth his praises, so should we sing and chant them out with Oral Voice, and Mental Understanding, And thus as blessed Angels, who in Heaven behold the face of God, continualy cry unto him, <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of Hosts</hi>; so we beholding the Reflections therof in the <hi>Speculum</hi> of Created Nature, should subjoin in Consort, <hi>the whole Earth is full of his Glory.</hi> And more specialy we should prais him for our own Human Nature, which is the Summ of all the rest, and Completion of both the Sensible, and Intelligible Worlds, quartering all the Familys of Nature in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thine Eys did see my Substance, yet being Imperfect, and in thy Book were all my Members written; which in continuance of time were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioned, when as yet there was none of them.</hi> Thus I was Created through the most free Grace of my Creator, and was not what I now am long since the World was made, and which might still have continued without me; who am a very Inconsyderable and Insigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant Portion of Mankind, among all the Innumerable Millions of men, who have been before me, are now with me, and shall be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter me, and yet as much concerned in my Creator, and he as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly regarding me, as if there were none other man in the World, And as I, before I was, so my Parents, or any others,
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:61550:263"/>
could not designe or desire any such being for me, nor foretell or imagin what I should be; but only my Divine Father, who did set down and prescribe in his Book of Eternity the <hi>Idea</hi> of my Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality, and whole <hi>Compositum,</hi> and accordingly formed me in my Mothers Womb, molding my Body, the Tabernacle of my Soul, by a Vegetative Plastical Virtue, and producing my Sensitive Spirit out of the common Clay, and lowest part of the Earth, inspired into it my Intellective Spirit, as a Light Incensed that shall never be Extinguished, an Intelligence Ingenerable, and Incorruptible for ever. And now I am my self, and not another, nor ever shall be any other then my self, and so am put into the present possession of my own everlasting Being; though my Soul living and dwelling in this Mortal Body, for this short space of a Temporary Life, hath this small Segment of its Eternity set out and appointed to be the sole opportunity of gaining my everlasting Welbeing: and the Intellectual and Spiritual Welbeing of my Soul is only the Union and Communion therof with my Infinite Creator, which is the true <hi>Apotheosis</hi> of Intellective Spirits. In which Original State of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perfection Human Nature was first Created, but, by the Apostacy and Defection of our first Parents, did again sink down into the Mortality of the Body, and the self-confounded <hi>Chaos</hi> of the Soul. And now, O Mankind! admire and adore for ever the Infinite and Incomprehensible Glory of God, and Mystery of his Spiritual Kingdom of Redemption farr exceeding all the Glory of his Natural Kingdom of Creation, which was only the foundation or Scene of the other, being so made in order therunto, and wisely con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>der, how God, Infinite in himself, look'd through this Finite World, as a Bubble of Diaphanous Air; computing all Creatures therin, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as so many <hi>Cyphars,</hi> which though more or fewer, greater or less, before or after, in or among themselvs, yet all signify the same Nothing in Divine Account; neither adding to, nor diminishing from the Infinity of their Creator. And therefore from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, before the Foundations of the World were laid, he designed and decreed to Invest his own Son, the Uncreated, Essential, and Intrinsecal Image of himself, with the Created, Artificial, and Extrinsecal Image of our Humanity; and therin with the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Nature of the Created World. By whom Finite is thus uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Infinity, and Mutable to Immutability, and in whom God Infinitely and Immutably enjoieth himself, in the full Embraces
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:61550:263"/>
both of his Essence, and Operations. And this is that new and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Creation, which shall endure for ever: wherof it is also said, as of the first Creation. <hi>In the Begining was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the Begining with God. All things were made by him, and without him nothing was made that was made.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now I prais thee, I bless thee, I adore thee, Lord, God, Creator of Heaven and Earth! for thine own Uncreated Glory, Eternaly Immanent in thy self, and for the Transient manifestations therof in and to thy Creatures. And as I admire thine own Infinite Incomprehensibility, so also all those Finite Incomprehensibles in Nature, and all the Comprehensibles therof, which may be known by us; for whatsoever we do or can truly know of thee, or thy Works, is most excellent; and so is all that we cannot know. And I thank thee for the discovery of the Initial Creation, and Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Confabrication of the World, by thy Word; and the retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Revelation therof to thy Servant <hi>Moses:</hi> and for any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of that Primitive <hi>Apocalyps</hi> to me thy most unworthy and unable Servant, by the Illumination of thy Divine Spirit. And now I beseech thee to revele it more and more to the whole World, that we may all know and acknowledg the only true <hi>Genesis</hi> of the World, and thee the Creator, who art both the Author, and End therof. And wherin I am Ignorant, still teach thou me, or wherin I have Erred, discover it to others: that neither thy Divine Truth may be dishonored by my Human Infirmity, nor any honor therof ascribed to my Infirm Humanity: but that we all, may always, and in all things, Laud and Glorify the most Holy Name of thee, the Infinite <hi>Iehovah,</hi> and Creator, through <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> the <hi>Messiah,</hi> our Redeemer; whom to Know is Life Eternal, <hi>Amen.</hi>
