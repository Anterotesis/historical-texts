         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>TO THE Inhabitants of LONDON,</hi> This is, a MESSAGE, in the Name of the LORD.</head>
            <p>THus ſaith the Lord, <hi>Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away, before one jot or tittle of my Word ſhall paſs away unfulfilled;</hi> even my living Word is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed for ever, and ſtandeth faſt in all Generations: That which no man made, can no man alter nor change.</p>
            <p>And this is it to <hi>London</hi> and the Inhabitants thereof; Open your ears to hear, and your hearts to underſtand the Lord's Controverſie with you: even this is my Controverſie, ſaith the Lord, and my determination ſaith the Almighty; who am mighty to perform that which I have ſpoken, and to bring to paſs the thoughs of my heart in all Generations.</p>
            <p>Thy Decrees made in thee ſhall not ſtand, the unrighteous Precepts preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by thy Law-makers ſhall not continue, they that make them are like unto them, the thoughts of their hearts are altogether vain; they ſhall not abide nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, but paſs away as their own dung, and as the untimely Birth of a Woman: They ſhall never ſee the perfection of that Day they look for; a Cloud ſhall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it, and a Night from the Lord, that livethfor ever and ever, ſhall dwell upon it; that which is unto the wicked, as the ſhadow of Death, ſhall dwell upon it.</p>
            <p>Wo be unto all treacherous hearted in thee, that pretend <hi>Liberty,</hi> while they are whetting their Swords to <hi>ſlay,</hi> and pointing their Arrows to <hi>ſhoot at the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</hi> Their Swords ſhall enter into their own Bowels, and Arrows ſtick in their Reins, the Pit they are digging for the Anointed of the Lord, and Holes to fling his Jewels into, they themſelves ſhall fall in. This is my Controverſie and my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination ſaith the Lord of the whole Earth.</p>
            <p>But, they that make the Lord their Refuge, even the Lord their Hiding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place (at all times) and fear not man, that muſt die, and periſh as his own dung, but wait on the Lord, and in all things that befall them, acknowledge him able to ſave out of all: Your hearts ſhall live, that ſeek the Lord, even him alone, and his face continually; in his Salvation ſhall ye rejoyce, and your ſouls in it ſhall delight world without end.</p>
            <p>Live in God, the Fountain of Love, Life and Power; there is an end of all Sufferings, there the Weary be at reſt, there the Priſoners reſt together out of the reach of the Oppreſſor. Judge ſelf in every ſtate, ſtrait, and condition; give not your power to the Beaſt, neither ſtrengthen the Wicked, (nor give them eaſe) by looking or ſeeking unto them for help and deliverance, that are your Perſecutors; But with <hi>David,</hi> let your ſouls and minds ſay, <hi>Our Help ſtandeth in the Name of the Lord, that made Heaven and Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo, The Lord God viſit thy Own in every one, that we that love it, may rejoyce with it, now and ever more.</p>
