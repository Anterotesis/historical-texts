            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

From whence comes then this retraction? or how can you be so cruell to terrifie me with suspition? Oh doe not thinke that I haue praised those eyes, which my sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, in absence, imagine to reflect a very Sunlike lustre? that I haue doted on that fauor and comelinesse, which in the contemplation did euer transport me beyond my selfe? that I haue bene enamored on your beauty, which in the gazing hath ouercome mee with admiration? that I haue beene rauished with those kisses, which see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med an infused life to my distracted heart? that I haue bene amazed on that face, which me thought was a very mappe of louelinesse, and all in vaine? as though I could passe ouer the remembrance of my contentment with slightnesse, and frame my selfe to beleeue contraries.

                  <hi>MY onely Beloued,</hi> I had not thought loue, especially in such youth, had bin capable of moderation, that already you can be contented to dispute the matter with reason, and to consent to the peeuish restraint of ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding arguments; which some enuious tongue hath whispered vnto you. Oh that our first meeting had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued this restraint: then with small griefe I might haue ouer passed my feare: or had the fire bene kindled with artificiall degrees, I might haue preuented the flaming outright. But now when I am in the violence of my speed, when the heart burneth with passion, when my very life dependeth on the hope of your assent, and that,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:2980:6"/>
in a manner, you resolued my cure and redresse, to stand at a stay, to dispute the matter, to find cause of distasting, worketh in me impatience, so that I know not how to demeane my selfe. Oh, do not slightly passe ouer these things, or with an vnkindly grauity censure my procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. Remember I haue, will, and must loue; and what cannot or dare not loue effect? Is there a suspition of prodigality? loue wil be a shepheard, nay a slaue. Is there a mistrust of incontinency? loue will settle desire, and quite extinguish all flames of vniust concupisence. Is there a breaking out of folly? loue worketh discretion, &amp; reformeth abuses. Is there a feare of want? loue hath no want, and contriueth impossibilities. Is there a doubt of any thing else? loue attaineth any thing else, and facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateth any difficulty. Alas, what could I not say to pleade for my selfe? what would I not say, nay what would I not doe to please my selfe, especially when such louelinesse enamoreth? Do not therfore beleeue: faith and honesty bids you not beleeue? myselfe bids you not beleeue these slanderous enemies of affection, these brokers of misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports: for I protest you shall finde it otherwise, and they in the disceptation proue ashamed of wronging the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent. Let me therefore come to appease them, let mee come to satisfie you, let me come to iustifie my selfe: nay let me come to die quickely or liue happily: for this is intollerable, and I cannot credit my feares, nor beleeue these tormenting apparitions.</p>

Concerning your greatnesse, we haue many instances of <hi>Queenes</hi> and <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> pulling vp inferior persons to honour: nor is loue ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to such lawes of priuacy; but being naked, himselfe shewes plainely, that flesh and blood lies as naked to the incursions of his passions in high and lowe: the lowe not ouer-awed with titular dignities, or outward shows; nor the preheminence of the hie priuiledged fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> amorous af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the lowe. For my selfe, I am in blood generous, and in affection fully contracted to loyalty: concerning discouery, who shall betray vs but our selues? nay, who dare whisper against vs but iealousie? and in that lies the secret of our prosperitie. For what is difficult to get, is carefully preserued; and where there is danger in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture, there is sweetnesse, and ioy exceeding other ioyes, when the perill is ouerpassed: therefore be you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, and let me bustle with mischance; for I am resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to loue you against all ouerwatchings. Concerning suspition, Oh giue not wings to my feares, that some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will intrude and participate my immunities; or doe you it onely to make a triall of my spirit? Beleeue it; before I will consent to such basenesse, I will pray for <hi>Sampsons</hi> strength to pull downe the house on all our heads together. And concerning your losse, Oh there is death in the verie sound, and it cannot bee raised out of any other circle, then enuy at my prosperitie, or your owne desire of a more worthy seruant, whereat I

Besides, some tongues haue traduced her for a wanton: and then is beauty as ill bestowed, as valure in a prophane swaggerer: so that me thinks you should rather haue challenged any other for deprauing me in this kind, then beene challenger your selfe to raise a greater disease.

you beleeue I haue apprehended your wil, and would thus satisfie your desire. True friendship is an vndissimuled consent of our affection towards one another, and a very transportation of two hearts into one body: so that two friends in a manner loue with one minde, speake with one tongue, execute with one hand, liue with one life, and sometimes die with one death. Amongst friends must be no contradiction, no disproportion of conditions, no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>similitude in manners, nor talke of mine and thine. Doth hee sorrow? thou must mourne: doth hee reioyce? thou must not repine: doth hee complaine? thou must not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse: doth hee demaund? thou must not denie: doth hee want? thou must not murmure: doth hee contriue? thou must practise: doth hee desire? thou must not reproue. For though priuate thoughts are proper to our selues, yet the fortunes, goods, persons, and estate of friends, are to remaine in a pleasant communitie: vpon this, some Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers haue maintained, that one man can haue but one friend; framing thus an argument, <hi>A contrariis.</hi> If there be danger in many enemies, by reason of the many and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine courses to reuenge: there is trouble in many friends, by occasion of diuisions in consent. According to the opinion of <hi>Aeschines,</hi> there was no such griefe as to be diuided from him we did loue. For looke what properties loue euer contained, were in friendshippe maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: and because loue could not receiue her estimation fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> vntoward liberty to change; friendship hath bene denied her desires to alter. <hi>Tully,</hi> the light of eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce, had friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in such account, that he preferd it before kindred, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in the dissolution of loue, the name of a kinsman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, but in the priuation of friendship all titles and goodnes ended.

                  <hi>SIR,</hi> Had not our friendshippe receiued reciprocal strength from true vertue, and worthy conuersation; I could slightly haue passed ouer your last deniall of trifles, and quietly gathered the raines of discretion to restraine the forwardnesse of impudency or combersomnesse: but when I remembred our combination, and with what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions we contracted a league, especially the nature and propertie of friendship, me thought there was a pleasure to name you so, and a comfort to finde you so: therefore from hencefoorth let vs vnderstand one another better; either firmely to maintaine the cause of kindnes, or light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to leaue it vnder the colours of courtesie. For the best Philosophers haue chained loue and friendshippe with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall goodnesse, so that as loue can endure no competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, friendship must abide no community: as loue can haue but one fauorite; friendshippe should admit but of one companion: as loue pardoneth, friendship forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth; as loue commandeth all, friendship is denyed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: as loue entreth when he list, friendship doth so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controwled: as loue triumpheth ouer the heart and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, friendship raigneth ouer body &amp; goods: no excuses, no drawings backe, no contracted brow, no delaies, no hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the head, no daintinesse, or absurd ceremonies; but a happy <hi>Sympathy</hi> to strengthen goodwill, and an absolute power to command, and readines to obey one other.

For a small helpe will stay a fainting man, when a strong arme cannot lift him vp, that is falne flat on the ground. I vrge not this, to draw you to any inconueniences concerning your purse, but to keepe vs both vpright touching our credits, and so with a meere disturbed hand, and troubled minde, I bid you farewell; but I am resolued to endure no further vnsauory iests against me, for any hopes of worldly helpes.</p>

Wherefore without further comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or larger circumstances for those many fauours, wherewith your plentifull hand hath euen laden me; I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the exchecquour of the poore, and thanke you with a publike acknowledgement of the same.

And concerning your last promise vnperformed, how can I be compared better then to a man lying faint and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the ground, whom some courteous hand seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to aduance, but lifting him vp halfe way, letteth goe his hold, and so he falleth backe againe to his sore hurt? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, good <hi>Sir,</hi> either giue my hope fuller wings, that it may take a higher flight of security, or let me die at once, to auoide an euerliuing misery: and this I vrge the rather, because in cases of vntoward distresse, there is courtesie in quicke dispatch; as in the benefits of friendship there is a double pleasure in the timelinesse, and orderly disposing of fauour.

                  <hi>SIR,</hi> I am sorry that my letters were either vnsauory for the matter, or tedious for the length, considering that out of the rules of ciuilitie I was to answer yours, and the necessitie of my businesse to importune further, then you thought good manners. But such is the misery of wants; and poore men are resembled to ruinous walles, which euery man shunneth for feare of falling vpon them; otherwise I could excuse my selfe many waies. First, to auoide idlenesse, wherein the <hi>Persians</hi> were so obseruant, that they would rather whittle stickes, or rip the seames of their coate, and sewe them vp againe. Secondly, to eschew ingratitude, which is a vice vnbefitting a generous minde of all other. Next, to exercise my vnderstanding; for to write to so delicate a iudgement, and apprehensiue a wit, craueth study and a carefull foresight: then, to better my knowledge: For if I doe well, your commendation can confirme me; if I fall into errors, your wisedome can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme and restraine me. Fifthly, to make you beleeue, there is some good thing in me allowable and iustifiable, and therefore worthy of a small regard, as noble Sir <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip Sydney</hi> was wont to say, Let vs loue him for one good qualitie; for a great many haue none at all, and no man hath all. Lastly, to know what to trust vnto; for to hope for a thing which commeth not, and to loue them that care not for vs, be two of the liuing deaths in this world. Therefore, <hi>Good Sir,</hi> let me not pleade in vaine, that pleade so truely, and vrge these reasons, rather to know how your loue shall bee inlarged, then my vaineglory published: and if you please to second my enterprise, I shall with a further cheerefulnesse proceede in my businesse; if not, as good fall at first, and all at once, as liue in expectation of

                     <hi>The differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce betweene a willing and compulsed absence.</hi>
                  </note> as if they were rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamers, then extinguishers of loue, hath almost startled my resolutions concerning the negatiue: that is, whereas I held an opinion that iealousie &amp; absence were rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencies in themselues, and meerely obstacles to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing kindnesse, I am now perswaded, they may so march in the army of passions, as to haue the Vauntgard in the encounter of affection: but withall I haue learnd so much cunning in morality, as thus to distinguish betweene their abuses. Concerning absence, there is a difference in that which is constrayned, and that which is voluntary. For there may be honourable causes of the one, when the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at (the best) is but an vntoward triall of one another, as imployment in martiall affaires, legation to forraine Princes, trauell to enrich experience, necessitie of trafficke and such like: to all which no worthy party beloued, but will affoord a helping hand, and admit of hope of returne; patience to endure, and wisedome to harken after his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours: but voluntary absence, if it could bee veiled vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the adulterate shew of trials, hath so many ill compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, that it can neither doe well it selfe, nor bring them to any good order. For commonly, it is accompanyed with carelesnesse, slacknesse in obseruation, suspition, feare of idle humours, vnkindnesse; and, at last, meets with vtter obliuion, with diuers of that sort: and what shall the party beloued conceite, if she first demand reasons of his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and after finde a breach of vowes for his returne? so that alledge what philosophicall inference you may, and guild it ouer with the imposturing Art of Oratory: I abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely conclude, that howeuer pleasure is the stronger in
<pb facs="tcp:2980:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his rarity; loue, true, honest, and perfect loue is no way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to a wilfull absence. Touching iealousie, I confesse I haue read of a holy-day in hell, when loue and iealousie were marryed together: but howeuer they feasted for that day, I am sure, all the time after they were turmoyled with despight: For except a great discretion ouermaster suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; feare, rage, madnesse, watchings, disquiet, absteining from meate and rest, torment of minde, and vntoward di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>pany vs, especially if there be the least cause giuen of the breach of vowes. Oh then, loue prooues like a beautiful glasse, which once broken, can neuer be cemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againe: yet I confesse, there may bee a ciuill emulation concerning a Riuals worthinesse, and honest feare to haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard the thing vnobtained: but once, wiued and contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnseparable, there can be no man iealous, but vpon his wiues disloyalty; and she that giues the occasion, must ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture her honour. I will not therefore haue the marryed man iealous; and would tye the amorous suiter within cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine bounds, lest by transcending, he transshape his owne discretion into fury, and quarrelsome humours, of which, a well disposed Gentlewoman would, nor should be any way guilty: and so, till I heare further, I leaue what you haue heard, to a fauourable construction.</p>

Go on therefore, go on, that I may liue to say, Yonder goes the wonder of time, and the true example of noblenesse and beautie But I dare not enlarge my wishes, lest I fall into an extasy, and from giuing good counsell to others, crosse mine owne iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for not doing as I should my selfe: yet I sweare, if my fortune were worthy the name of a fortune, I durst tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph amongst other masters of earthly contentments, that you thinke me of deseruing to bee commanded by you, and put me in the Catalogue of your chiefest friends.

                     <hi>A gentleman must take heede how he settles himself in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itry as a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</hi>
                  </note> I well perceiue by your worthy disposition, that obliuion cannot get the mastery of vertue in iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious and honest friends. For howeuer we are remote in body, you haue iustified your remembrance toward mee, yea continued a good opinion, and strengthened it with a conceit of my vnderstanding somwhat; concerning your retired country, tis so, that some thing must now be said, drawing neare to satisfaction, but especially to discharge the dutie of a friend, and faithfull well-willer. Beleeue it then, that in diuers persons a country life neighboureth contemplation and quietnesse, according as we adapt our selues to the same. For a Gentleman, of any reasonable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, desiring to free himselfe of citie vanities, continuall resort, extraordinary expences, superfluous diet, curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of apparell, and alluring temptation, may so seate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and persecute his passion, as to meet with profite and reposednes, in the countrey: but then his resolution must be, not for any occasion to ouerpasse the limits of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended expences; because, if hee once step into the vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious reputation of a housekeeper, a giuer of almes, and desire of salutations from russet coates: his verie Hall will eate vp his Parlour, and hee shall bee drawne in to spend more at a Christmasse, then his vpper chamber in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie did in a tweluemonth. But for a free spirit, and a liuer onely vpon a stocke, to bee emboldened with the hope of commoditie, and bettering his estate by a husbandly paines-taking, is as farre from expectation, as to feede a hunting horse on the commons, and yet presume to run with him for the best game. For hee that must say to his seruants, Go, and to his men, Doe this, must be a Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion, who liues vpon an annuall entrade: but <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 span">

a vine-dresser, must labour and take paines himselfe, yea haue both art and discretion to manage his affaires, that when he sees a barren figge-tree, he may not in a rage goe and cut it downe, or stocke it vp: but prune it, dung it, dig the earth about it, and make triall of another yeere. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, for a Gentleman of worth, to liue in any towne in suspition of a decaied estate, or necessitie to increase him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe by industry: especially where they doe but seeme bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter men of eminence, is, as if a man should goe from his vnderstanding friends, who out of ciuilitie would neither disteeme him, nor reueale his secrets: and proclaime the same in publike, exposing himselfe so to derision. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it, howeuer the country man may bid you good mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and stubbornely bend his knee, his heart is full with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and at home hee cares not what he murmures against you; except you are in office to controwle him, as a Iustice of peace: or in abilitie to pleasure him, as Lord of the Mannor: or incredite to terrifie him, as some officer at Court: or in estimation to master him, as some noble mans man or other; especially, a priuy counsellours. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, the seruants will loyter, the Bailiffe will sooth you vp with flattery to deceiue you; the cattell will famish or diminish, the plough will go vntoward, the whole family liue in confusion, and the best by-word shall be for you: a poore Gentleman Farmer. All which considered, I could be contented to see you here again, where you may eate meate with the best, and sort out your pleasures at as easie a rate, as you list.</p>

But withall, is not the house of too great receipt, costly to furnish, chargeable to repaire, dangerous to keepe, and drawing on extraordinarie expences euen for fewell and maintenance? besides, is there not a certaine expectation of extraordinary house-keeping, and entertaining of passengers? Wherein to proceede, it will drinke vppe the profite of the Farme like a Spunge; wherein to drawe backe, will drowne your reputation in vilipending.

                     <hi>Concerning the building and ordring a house with retaining of seruants.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>SIR,</hi> When I opened your last letter, and ouerviewed the sentences diuided into interrogatories, I was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most affrighted, as if there had bene a citation sent for me: but after I considered the particulars, and saw they were onely houshold aduertisements, or (if you will) husbandly questions, for the better setling a man in the possession of contentment: I cheered my selfe, and thought it good manners thus to answer them; wherein, if I pay you in your owne coine, and not once to looke into the treasure house of Oratorie for any rhetoricall amplification, reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ber the iustice of my cause, and the low flight of my subiect. But to the purpose: VVhereas you demand, how you should build your house? I answer thus; That though former times esteemed it better to haue a house too litle for a day, then too bigge for a whole yeare, and cared for no conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencie of lodgings, so the hall and kitchin were bigge enough to dresse meate, and entertaine company; yet doe not you so, but discouer a good spirite by the outward fashion of your building, choose a handsome prospect and wholesome scituation; let your lodgings bee warme and light, for you may darken them at pleasure; your staires easie, and your roomes of entertainment large &amp; delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some; the out-houses conuenient, the gardens and orch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards to the South and your owne chambers neere your
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:2980:22"/>
husbandrie, yet as farre from annoyance as you may. In a word, let the whole frame discouer your willingnesse to do well, rather then brand you to hereafter memory for couetous and basely disposed; and if you can leaue an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of a thousand markes behinde you, let the passers by, viewing the house imagin it a 1000. pound a yeare. For so a second good husband &amp; a good family to match in, may raise it in another age, and then followeth a kinde of repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that my father or grandfather was not well aduised, and esteemed more of money, then the reputation of his family. But, aboue all, take heed you exceed not this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, lest either you incurre derision, for beginning a worke you were not able to finish; or leaue the house to emptinesse and decay, if your next heire be not sufficient to adorne and furnish it. Whereas you demand what reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to keepe? I answer, Haue rather one too few, then two too many, &amp; of al other things, take heed to an idle serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t for corrupting the rest: for I cannot but resemble him to a stinking broad spreading burre, who is not onely bad in it selfe, but hinders the rest of the grasse growing round about it. And concerning outward shew, by that time your Clearke, Coachman, Butler, keeper of your Wardrobe, chiefe Bailiffe, and better sort of husbandmen be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the houre of attendance, and haue also an honest care and cunning, cleanely to shift themselues, there may be a sufficient ostentation for a hundred pound a yeare. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you demand what fare you should keepe: I answer thus; let not the Sunday so exceed, as there be scarcitie in the weeke following: giue the laborer sufficient, for dainties fill not the belly: allow not euery one a breakefast, nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day three meales: haue your meate warm and good, but do not reserue the best dish, till it be starke naught: if a neighbour come in about businesse, let him tarry a Gods name; if he be inuited, set before him, what he hath not
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:2980:23"/>
at home; rather haue a litle &amp; fresh, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> return a great deale to smell of the dry larder; and aboue all, let not the end of the table be so forgotten, either to be serued with blowne drinke, stale bread, or refuse meate: (For goers and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers by the dore will looke for that, and better) because such a heart and tongue may sit at your boord, as will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine at his nasty entertainment; and be bold to publish your reproach. Wheras you demand what cattell to keep, I answer thus. For a Gentleman, Oxen are better then Horse, because after any mischance they may be fed for the butcher, and few men of sort would cart for mony, or attend the court with a Teeme: let such doe that, as loue toile and mony, and tast any paines taking with the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerines of profit: those geldings you keepe, let them be wel &amp; orderly kept: so that if your country must be serued, you haue one in readines: the serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ts which ride with you, let them be honest, carefull, and well prouided, and take heed of basenes, as plowing cattell, broken saddles, patcht bootes, vnmatched spurres, a sword without a chape: nay I would not haue the sword and hangers of one fashion, and girdle or dagger of another, with infinit such dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, and meerely ridiculous nastinesse. Wheras you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand what gouernment to obserue? I answer generally thus: and for particulars, you shall heare more heereafter: Aboue all, remember the Sabboth, and rather feast of any day, then of that: not but that the Sabboath is a continuall feast, but how? for spirituall purposes, not filthy gurmun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice: more then necessity of life, and good vse of conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation: let no swearer nor prophane person, once or twise admonished, tarry with you: giue good examples by your owne praiers: and rather by gentle exprobration, then fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy vndecncies reprehend your seruants, but suffer them not to be masters amongst themselues. To conclude, be charitable towards offenders, gentle to inferiors, willing
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:2980:23"/>
to giue, carefull of good neighbours, and remember the sicke labourer, and fainting soule.</p>

                     <hi>Whether a gentlewoman may with her credit let out lodgings for money.</hi>
                  </note> I vnderstand by your first seruant, that you haue enlarged your minde with your house, determining to lodge ciuill Gentlemen, and to raise a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit from their entertainment: besides, you adde for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, want of company, and that your house is ouer-great for your owne family: here is now a subiect of plentifull matter, and in dilating the same, I must needes incurre displeasure on all sides. But there is now no remedy; you haue in a manner enioyned me to deliuer my opinion, &amp; I will be briefe and plaine, according to my skill. I then would with one blow cut off the <hi>Hydraes</hi> head of confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and ouerthrow all distinction by the negatiue, thus; That a Gentlewoman, whether widdow or wife, liuing in the freedome of reputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, is not to be seruile in any thing, nor to bedurtie herselfe with the dregges of any couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, or sinister practises against her credite. For as it is vnbefitting to a Gentleman to bee guiltie of any seruile crime; so it is vndecent to a Centlewoman to incurre the hazzard of her honestie by any base inclination. Now what can the best lodging and lodgers maintaine, but the inconueniences depending will quickely ouer-sway the the profite following? For if they be onely men, they must haue seruants, and commers, and goers; the seruants shall bedurty your carpets and couerlets (if the masters them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues are tied within the circle of respect and ciuilitie) wipe their bootes and scabberds on your best furnitures, tosse your kitchen, commaund your vtensels, turmoyle
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:2980:24"/>
your house, and vpon the least contradiction burst out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to violent and offensiue tearmes: and for your selfe at the best, you shall passe with the character of Hostesse, Land-ladie, Sweete heart, or some such inuention. The commers and goers shall bee of all sorts, yea many times Seamsters, Launderers, kinsewomen, and such like, not without some venomous inclination to incontinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and riot, vnder the handsome greene grasse and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of businesse, and entertainement. If they bee onely women, I can say no more, but women will bee women, who cannot liue without the company of men; and then if the fire and tow be put together, there must needes be combustion, what glorious shew soeuer the flame ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare with; or what admirable cunning is vsed in the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or extinguishing: so that, hold the ballance of an vpright conscience how you will, you shall not scape the imputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of dishonest practises from base calumniation, howeuer the better sort hold their peace to make you an instrument for their pleasures. If they bee men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, so a doubling of many inconueniencies; there is but onely this excuse affoorded, that Opportunitie is a baude to Corruption, and vncleane persons are now safe, being so conueniently lodged. This is briefly my opinion touching a Gentlewoman that lodgeth for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. But for others that are tradesmen, and must aduance their estates from the gaines of their profession, I dispute not at all, but leaue it as a thing indifferent to my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, howeuer I would not haue them lose the benefits of their endeauours, when they may make dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vse of them. First, in the rent of their chambers, next, in the encrease of customers for the venting such wares as they expose to sale, wherein their credite lyeth, onely at the state in those customary vsances of swearing,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:2980:24"/>
lip-labour, and the secrets of their businesse, so that letting their lodgings, may seeme lesse offensiue through a cunning ignorance, then many indirect speeches through a customary dissembling.</p>

                     <hi>The danger of disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between man and wife with their dueties.</hi>
                  </note> It was an vnsauory news to me, when I heard that some ominous action had diuided the mutuall agreement betweene you and your wife, wherein I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not resemble you better, then to a churlish husbandman, who putteth some head-strong horse into his Teeme, and when they go forward, he striueth backeward, the seruants beating him to greater rage, and the Master wanting dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion to take him away, till a more conuenient season, so that howeuer they disquiet themselues, I am sure the war in hand, is rather hindered then forwarded. Thus is it, when man and wife are not fast tyed in the bands of loue and discretion, but subiect the whole house to confusion, and send disgracefull rumor abroad to busie idle tongues, with many vntruths amongst some certainties. For alas, what man will be so foolish that loueth cleanlinesse, as to besmeere himselfe with durt and filth? what husband will be so senslesse as to reuile his wife, and bring his owne name in question? what shall the children thinke to heare their mother called whore? what shall the seruants ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine to see their mistresse distracted with iealousie and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spition of one side, and shame and calumniation on the other side? what shall the neighbours imagine, to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with such disgraces, and whisper that a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man so abused himselfe, or durst discredit his wife. Come, this must not be; For as women must admit of an hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable obedience, rather then imperious controwle, of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:2980:25"/>
sweete and gentle perswasion, rather then contentious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation: of a modest disposing themselues to all house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold affaires, then a busie entermedling with their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands affaires; of a fashionable entertainement at all sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, especially a wise obseruation according to time and occasion: rather then a sudden apprehension of their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands distemprature, either in passion or affection: so must men abandon themselues from home inconueniences, beare with their wiues imperfections, not taunt before seruants, not burst out into filthy and scurrilous chiding, or reproches at all; be charitable euen concerning offence, not churlish for trifles, not deny necessaries, and in no sort giue ill example by leaud life, or bad husbandry: lest wants knocke at the doore, and then will bitternesse and displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure enter. So that concerning falling out betweene man and wife, I thus conclude; If it bee possible to auoyde all eruptions against ciuill life, louely behauour, or necessarie businesse: but if disagreements begin to shew a face, let the man leaue the wife for that time, and not endure the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention: let the wife retire her selfe, if the man begin, and not dare to reason the matter.</p>

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:2980:25"/>
and the other step aside into wantonnesse. Therefore saith the wise man, that hee that setleth his sonne, hath layde a strong foundation, and he that marrieth his daughter, hath dispatched his chiefest businesse. Whereupon I would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise you, concerning your sonnes, not to cocker them too much, or be ouer-nice, either at their vprising or dyet: not to let slip their yeares, but commit them as soone as you can into the hands of instruction: bee not of that minde, that the rod must be a tyrant to them, but rather endeuor that they feare to offend for the loue of vertue, then feare of punishment: suffer neither oath nor vncleanely speech to profane or defile their mouth, nor let them presume proudly to insult, or vnmannerly to reuile the meanest seruant. Comming forward, and growing to vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, make not nature a slaue to cunning or profit; that is, enforce them not against their owne inclination to follow that which is irkesome vnto them. For, if you tie a great spirit to a seruile trade, hee will neuer proue good chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; or contend with dul capacitie about mistical secrets, he will neuer grow good scholler, &amp; so in the rest: let them euer be, where either the best company shal giue good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; or if inconueniences follow, they may haue the shadow of honourable purposes: but aboue all, let them neither practise deceit nor dishonestie: for, when a mind is once corrupted with basenes, it resembles a stinking ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, which will neuer be througly sweetned. Concerning your daughter, presume not too much of our countrey li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; for wantonnesse standeth at the corner of euery Street, to inuite the commers-by: yet do not so restraine her, that shee may eyther murmure at the same, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine to her neighbours of her Parents hard hand, as though shee were viciously inclined by nature. If it bee possible, rather school her within dores, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> aduenture her

with a pedant abroad; and for dancing, courtship, and such like: let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> be vsed rather like a feather to a litle dust, which may be brushed from the garment, the guard or seame, which shall weare out with the cloath: giue them warning of familiarity with the seruants: For a curteous ciuility becommeth the children of Gentlemen, but wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton embraces, sitting on the knee, bearing in armes, and such like, be fearefull signes of following confusion, and too forward desires: sitting vp late, allow not; nor giue way vnto night banquets: For they resemble the stolne bread in the Prouerbs: and a strumpets Title is the nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most hell, wherein the name of Virgine is perpetuallie damned: make them not proud, either of natures portion, or the fathers dowry. For women will looke in a glasse, and shal not want any flattering to seduce them to vanity: and concerning the vpshot of all reckonings, which is mariage, let her neither assume so dangerous a liberty, as to run at randome without your consent: nor be you so transported with a variety of selfe-loue, as to draw her perforce to vnpreuentable inconueniences, yea many times mischifes, and confusion. For, these matches in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, as (contracts for mony without liking; enforceme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ts, to vnequall yeeres, or nasty disparily, with diuers of that kind) are meerely, pullies to winde vp care, sorrow, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentments, and at one letting flippe the hold, to hurry them on the head of a poore afflicted virgin.</p>

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:2980:26"/>
there is a clause of exception inserted, for fathers and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters in correcting their children and seruants: yet will I giue no such way to the violence of passion, as that a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, or otherwise ciuill disposed liuer, should strike or wound his seruant with any dangerous weapon: nor can I any way colour your temeritie, for contending so long with that boysterous knaue, as to bee compelled to free your selfe: (for such be the words of your excuse out of his robustious closing with you) by the stabbe of a dagger, which ranne 9. inches vpward ouer his pappe. Beleeue me, it was a fearefull falling off, and I wish in my heart there had beene no such occasion giuen to draw your discretion in question, nay to endanger your person and estate. For if he had miscaryed, the king hauing lost a subiect, you must needs haue beene brought to iudiciall triall, &amp; then lawes are according to the Iudges constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or Iurors interpretation. Well, I hope from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forh you will be better aduised, and rather bring vp your seruants so, that either they shall not offend, or after the offence be apprehensiue of instruction with more gentle correction. Therefore choose the sonnes of such men, as rather will second their fathers honesty and credite, then follow their owne wantonnesse and riot: let euery one haue instruction for their feuerall places, yet teach them al to obey when you command, and not one to command another: haue an eye vnto the honest diligence of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, and grace him with a cheereful reward. If you chide for good occasion, ler the ptowdest be the subiect of your first admonition; wherein be so temperate, that vndecent reuilings heate not your mouth, but words sauouring of wisedome and iustice. Thus shall the rest stand in awe, when they see you are not partiall or fearefull: if aduice serue not, spare not a smarting blow; which if it prooue a sturrer vp of rage or conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>pt in him, bring him to publike

To conclude, in one word, let your seruants be such of all sortes, as shall doe what you prescribe, rather then make vse of the time to maintaine their owne pleasures, and licentiousnes: as for such as must performe inferior seruill duties, pay them truly, and send them to their worke orderly: neglect no seruice of God for any cause: and if you haue (as you ought) priuate praiers, let all come, and know what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence meaneth: hearken to the time of sicknes, and let them not complaine for want, nor cry out to God for sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning more then they can away with: vpon good deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, adde a recompence, and let none presume to strike or reuile another.

Yet because pollicy hath some secret walks into which Vertue will not enter, and that I see errors hale vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to dangerous inconueniences, without satisfaction of humours, I am contented at this time to deceiue your apprehension with the mist of pollicie, with guilefull fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of ambitious and contentious humours. If then your feare be so great of the knight your adioyning neighbour, and Lord of the mannor, that either you must come to triall of the law, and profuse expences, or meet with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted browes, and perillous encounters: there is no such way to wipe away the feare of these encombrances, as the

For God hath said, they are Gods, and there is no such proximity to a godhead, as with a breath to aduance whom they will, to haue mercy on whom they please, and to cast downe the presumption of such who abuse their fauor for vnhonest pretences. And thus I leaue your honor to the order pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, and successe of affaires.</p>

For if you sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome bring a Phisition in question, that knowing his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient out of danger of death, and of such a constitution, that some excellent potion will quickly aduance him to the pristinate state of health, and yet dallieth with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while, peraduenture to shew some secrets of arts: perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture to make him beleeue a difficulty in the recouery, and perauenture to inrich his purse by an often resort to him that is able to giue. There is no reason to presume so farre, as to cal in question the affairs of great Counsellors, especially determining for the common good, without partiall interposing either their own purposes or passions: nor can any man come vnto them at any time, but diuers shall bee found afore him, who challenge a dispatch of their businesse, according to the priority of their suites: therfore your honor must lay no such burthen of the state, to thinke, if there were such an interposition, that any mans priuate malice could preuayle with the authoritie, grauitie and wisedome of the rest. Besides, it may be there is a further policie to draw out the thred of this cloth of businesse at the greatest length, to keep you from a further suite, or troubling the king with other matters of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, till this be dispatched, and hung on the file of assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in your behalfe.

                  <hi>NOble Sir,</hi> Whereas at your last conference you told me comming from <hi>Germany</hi> to <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> you saw no watch set, and a kinde of fearefull stilnesse amongst the souldiers, wherein I could not resolue you so suddenly, because you spread no larger cloth of nouelties, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture durst not in that place raise any suspition by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding many questions: I haue now thought good to adde to your experience some intelligences of my owne, whereby as you well sayd, then I doe gather the occasion of that defection, and desisting from their martiall cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies: You must then vnderstand, that the Garrisons haue newly mutined, and from insolent attempts drawne a fearefull execution on some principall offendors: the Gouernour of the towne and citadell, did put in practise an ancient vsance and policie of martiall disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, to command a cessation from orderly watch, and souldier-like seruices: And this was an absolute custome euen amongst the <hi>Romans,</hi> that when insolent and tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous souldiers had looked with grimme and traiterous visages on the face of good order, and made a repugnant disobedience against all law and restraint, the Captaines presently prohibited any calling to the watch, any prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to the Parado, beating the drums, attending the colours, or to vse any ceremonious brauerie: whereby the mutiners, that were so lusty before, seeing what a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion they had wrought, and how they presented a sort of Padlarie reapers in a scattered field, beganne to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile the want of their honourable customes, and to confesse their former rudenesse and ouersight.

                  </note> Conceiue of me what you please, there is not a man in this kingdome shall haue more interest in me, then your selfe; and that you shall well perceiue by my plain and true satisfaction of your demands, although it be somwhat too intricate to deale in such confused que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, and dangerous relation of businesse; Whereas then you demand the reason, why so many great and noble per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons haue (as it were) met with death and destruction, in the violent race of their turbulent innouation, and inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent wilfulnesse: not taking warning by precedent exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, nor terrified with the euer-impending reward of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, which is the ouerthrow both of themselues and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. I answer, that truely I can yeeld you no reason, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all they pretend, is not onely against reason, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times against policie, and at all times against honesty and religion: yet can I giue you some false fires, and (as it were) contriue adulterate excuses out of fauour and partialitie. You haue read then that the diuell in compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the earth, did consider mens frailties in his progresse, and as the principall marke of the world, hee most glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously attempts, principallities and powers: so that sometimes hee pleadeth the axiomes of Philosohers, and reciteth a pestilent position out of <hi>Euripides</hi>: that if faith and loyaltie be to be rent asunder, it is excusable, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:2980:33"/>
a Diademe, and reaching at a Crowne. Thus <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen,</hi> Earle of <hi>Blois,</hi> vsurped the kingdome of England, and made warres on the faction of the Empresse. And thus <hi>Henrie</hi> the fourth in fringed his first vowe, to steppe no further then the Dutchie of Lancaster: but when hee found no hinderances, hee quickely ranged ouer all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther territories and iurisdictions. Sometimes hee dilates Matchiuilian policies, and telleth men that are cruell and ambitious, that they which meane to haue a smooth walke to contentment, yea to passe the time in any Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard or Garden of pleasure, must not onely remooue the greater blockes, stickes, and stones: but as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion serues, picke out the sharpe pibbles, and rowle the same smoother. Thus <hi>Athaliah</hi> destroyed the kings stocke to gaine the Diademe. And thus <hi>Richard</hi> the third, first remooued the Queenes kindred, after v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surped the persons of the two Princes. Sometimes hee whispereth in the eares of moderate kings, that they may bee iealous in pointes of soueraigntie; and who shall controwle them, if they settle their feares and peace, though they see the bleeding neckes of such as they feare? Thus <hi>Adoniah</hi> fell vnder his yonger brother. Thus <hi>Nero</hi> put <hi>Corbulo</hi> and <hi>Germanicus</hi> to death, because they were reputed worthie of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Thus was <hi>Mortimer</hi> in <hi>Henrie</hi> the fourths time, as it were, banished from the Court. Thus was long before that, <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandie</hi> depriued of his eyes. Thus was <hi>Edward Plantagenet</hi> Earle of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke</hi> imprisoned and destroyed: with many such like. Sometimes hee maketh the iustifying of a faction, and the louing of one another, and honest cause of rebellion: As you saw in the Barons <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>, in the beginning of <hi>Henrie</hi> the fourth, when the king should haue bene

destroyed at Oxenford, and afterward when the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> maintayned the coadiutements of <hi>Worcester</hi> and <hi>Mortimer.</hi> Sometimes hee rayseth innouation and treason out of the circle of ambition and vaine-glory, vpon any pretence of a title, as you saw in the first claime of <hi>Richard Plantagenet,</hi> Duke of Yorke: and in the last tumults of the Earl of <hi>Warrewicke,</hi> in <hi>Edward</hi> the fourths time. Sometimes hee deceiueth honour with couetousnesse, and bogges the mindes of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous spirits with hope of increase of liuing, and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations of titles. Thus was the Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> caught in a snare of the Earledome of <hi>Hertford,</hi> and not onely streched his arme out to helpe <hi>Richard</hi> the third to mount on the throne of Maiestie, against all religion and pietie: but to spreade the colours of his owne reuenge against the tyrant himselfe: whereby hee lost his head. Sometimes hee impostures men with the fanaticall hopes of diuellish promises from forcerie, and witchcraft: As you may reade of <hi>Elinor Cobham,</hi> who well expected the preferment of the Protector her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and of <hi>H<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>ford</hi> Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> whom the Cardinall ouerthrew in <hi>Henry</hi> the eights time. Somtimes hee bloweth the bellowes of popularitie, and swelleth men ouer bigge with the windy breath of opinion: as in diuers worthy presidents, and instances of our owne, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in euen the best subiects haue yet taken a wrong course to curbe their Princes, and making good causes (as refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of disorders, remoouing of euill Councellours, protecting of Iustice, and maintaining the honour of martiall discipline, &amp;c. Baudes to wicked and troublesome spirits, haue in the ende pulled on death and insuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table affliction on themselues and families: and sometimes he inciteth euen co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mon persons to presumptuous darings

and dangerous troubles, falsifying their wicked pretences, on the glorious shewes of the kingdomes good, as in the Irish expeditions, the rebellions of <hi>Straw,</hi> and <hi>Cade:</hi> the wicked purpose of <hi>Perkin Marbeck:</hi> the clamours of <hi>Ket,</hi> the insurrections of the <hi>North,</hi> and such like: In all which, from the beginning to the ending, there is no one sound and substantiall reason, but must needs be ouerthrowne with the shoulderinsg of truth and vprightnes. And thus could I fill you volumes with precepts and instances, and both diuide and subdiuide to infinit particulars, wherein greatnes and pollicy resemble poison in the hearts of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt persons, which runneth from veine to veine, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer desisteth till all be infected: and at last the very life blood contaminated: Nay, I could haue spread your let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to a greater bredth, euen with modern examples, and daily positions: but I cannot name them without offence, and traducing of many of their imperfections and follies: and therefore I will leaue what I may not write, to a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate relation, when we may meet with securitie.</p>

                  <hi>GOod Sir,</hi> If I were not tyed by the band of friendship, to all those duties, wherein honest men are, or should be actors; yet am I bound by the lawes of Christianitie to pleade Gods cause, and not to suffer (as farre as in me lies) so great a iustice to be ouerthrowne with the violent thrust of desperate and irreligious shouldrings. To what end then dare you so prophane the name of God? or to what purpose do you breath out the smoke of oathes, yea com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon periuries? as if the sulphure of that infernall furnace, were raised vp to darken the light of the firmament. Doe you know what danger you incurre? the vengeance pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, the threatnings denounced, and the punishments
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:2980:36"/>
appropriate to such idle and defiling wantonnesse? Do you not reade, that you shall be guilty before Gods seate, for taking his name in vaine? Doth not the Prophet tell you, that plagues shall inuade that house, where the swearer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth? Hath not our Sauior instructed vs, with yea, and nay? shewing plainly, that whosoeuer digresseth out of that path, walketh to perdition. And are not the Apostles the voyces of many waters, and the sounds of Gods trumpets against further irreligion, and vndecent oathes? And how dare you then continue in horrible prophanation, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not beleeue, or not apprehend this truth? Besides, if Sathan had taught vs cunning enough to excuse other vices: The glutton may say, he is a hungred: the vncleane person, he is ready to burne: the couetous man, he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayd to want: the murtherer, reuenge is sweete: the drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, that his drought is great: the theefe, that he is in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse, and such like. But the swearer hath neither reason, nor excuse for his idlenesse: no man enforceth him, the flesh inticeth not, the world prouoketh not, onely custom and the diuell raise a commotion against pietie and since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. So that it is almost come to passe, that a swearer and a lier moue in the same orbe of incredultty, and as the shepheards ranne so often in vaine to the boy, that told them the Wolfe was come into the fold, that when he came indeed, they did not beleeue him. So doth euery man abandon a swearer in his most vrgent occasions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause vnurged he made no conscience of an oath. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if not for Gods loue, Christian duety, sweetnesse of conuersation, and assurance of our contracts &amp; friendship; yet for feare of hell, and in regard of saluation, let mee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert you from this horrible, and hatefull vice.</p>

                  <hi>SIR,</hi> Although it appertaineth not to our sexe to take the rodde of restraint into our hands, and seeme free Denizons in the kingdome of wisedome, &amp; good counsel, more then men: yet because I am engaged for you to that honourable Lady: &amp; ser open the enclosure of your praises from my owne iudgement, and experience of your worth: I must needes presume (beyond your expectation) and craue pardon, if I seeme to haue a more daring confidence in this reprehension. To what ende then haue you cast durt and filth into the streame of your spirit, where a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of many vertues make a flood of perfection, and euen now, when a very mizer should set at large his hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound heart for expences, haue damned vp the same, with the mudde of auarice: you that haue carryed away good opinion with you in times past for courteous, affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, courtly, well-descended, free, noble, and (aboue the rest) a liberall Gentleman: now to make a stoppe, and darken all that lustre with a miserable sparing, and niggardly conuersation. And when in a time of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing loue, which seemeth to shed teares at your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generating condition, and to whom? to a Ladie of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and iudgement: whose very presence may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand presents and extraordinary expences; and where? in both your countreys, where reproach stands watching for any occasion, and enuious eyes behold you with repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and would faine looke iustly awry vpon the least de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity. Be therefore (good <hi>Sir</hi>) better aduised, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that in religion couetousnesse is resembled to Idolatrie: in Philosophy, to all wickednesse, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the best resolutions: in moralitie, to the dropsie, an insatiate disease, which the more corruption it hath, the

more it desires? in ciuill conuersation, to a nastie comber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somnesse, which terrifieth one another, and breaketh the band of true friendship. Alas, what doe you gaine by vnmeasurable hoording vp of wealth? but a base report, and a ridiculous pointing at, euen as you ride along. Nay, you shall be compared to a barking Dogge at cattle, fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on hay, which will neither let them take a repast, nor can helpe himselfe to satisfie nature. O, good <hi>Sir,</hi> though I am no Scholler, yet can I reade what other men doe write: and of all the vices which are enemies to a quiet soule, and free borne Gentleman, couetousnesse is the worst, basest, and most ridiculous. For, besides that, it detaineth vs from the ciuill vse of Gods blessings in the world, so that neither in diet, nor ornament, a man is master of himselfe: it maketh vs vnapt to the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of such vertues, as commonly helpe vs out of the filthy puddles of disreputation, &amp; keepe vs secure from ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniation, and bewitching corruption of profite: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for honours sake, for vertues sake, for friendships sake, for my sake, for your owne sake, for posterities sake, remember where about you goe, and how a good and free demeanour will preuaile, when these hard enclosed hands seeme rather to threathen stroakes, then promise hopefull entertainment.</p>

suspitious faces; and I dare not looke vpon them for feare some harsh news should whisper in mine eare their bastar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: our friends and acquaintance dare not meete without murmuring; and me thinks I heare them say, what shall we do in the house of shame, and eate at the table of inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency? Oh that thou hadst remembered <hi>Iudah</hi> against <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,</hi> that she should be burnt for playing the whore; &amp; yet a widow, and before the law: But when the <hi>Iewes</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to obedience, adultery was punished with death. But me thinks I heare the diuell to prompt thee, that they which dare aduenture their soules, dare hazzard their liues: and now it is not so strict as it was in the time of the law: For Christ himselfe forgaue the woman taken in adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and we liue in a commonwealth far from such extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity Is this your sophistry? take heede of cousening your owne soule, and deceiuing the trust which Christ hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in thee, making thee therby partaker of his pretious blood, and thy own redemption. But how? neither to spill the one by casting it abroad with vncleane and polluted hands; nor betray the other by conspiring with presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous sinners, to rebel against grace, repentance, &amp; newnes of life; wherin if thou dost not examin thy selfe, &amp; prepare to better conformity, I need not breath out vengeance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thee, or seek a greater iustice, then thy mischeeuous will, &amp; vnpenitent life shall pull vpon thy disguised shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse face, and defiled mishapen soule.</p>

misdoubt, either of your abilitie or honesty. For the very name of a friend shal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mand my person, much more my goods: but such a man as your selfe hath interest in my life &amp; spirit. Therefore beleeue it, I was so destitute of mony at that time, that casting vp an irkesome account of my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers departure, necessity enforced the pawning of my v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensels to furnish him; wherein if any experience, or exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple haue taught my tung the cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ning of excuses, let it here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after grow too big for my mouth, &amp; when my wants knock at the doore for supply, let hands of Adamant admit them no entrance to my insupportable afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s. But wheras you lay a further imputation vpon me, that my credit caried an ouerswaying command of my rich neighbor: true it is, that in former times, as Doues resort to glistring painted hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; as Farmers bring their seed into fat ground; as Beasts &amp; cattle resort to feeding places; &amp; as all the world is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported with priuat respect, I carried vp a head of thriuing wantonnes, &amp; he looked vpon me with a correspondent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacrity, but no sooner came the pulling hooke to throw down the fruit of my fertile trees, wherby he perceiued the boughs bare, and saw the knots and branches battered in peeces: but he suspected my prosperity, and added withall a fearefull prophesie of hereafter canker-eating, &amp; decay both of root and rinde. Thus are my hopes abortiue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernining my interest in him: &amp; to speake the truth, I am so fearefull of a deniall, that I had rather sit still with some ease, then rise and fall with vtter dispaire. Thus if I haue wonne the field against your incredulitie, and brought vp preuailing forces to strengthen your loue, and good will still on my side: I am then my selfe againe, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test I reioyce more truely in your sweete conuersation, then a wanton could doe, if his mistresse were to hang a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his necke with deceiueable kisses, and counterfeit embraces.

For though hee can strike away the secrets of friendship with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding hand, I may not forget the properties of a man, the libertie of my life, the royaltie of my profession: So that till I can recouer my pristine glorie, and iollity of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaritie, I will submit to these disasters, and make this vnworthy banishment, the author of Contemplation, and triall of affliction: In which, if my prayers ascend like a smoake of a sweete-smelling Sacrifice, I will thanke the God of comfort, for his Fatherly correction; and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in the same, that you may flourish in the worlde, like a faire fruitfull Tree, and prosper in your desires: as if <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi> seede did sowe in the Land of <hi>Abimelech</hi>: where hee receiued an hundred for one.

                     <hi>Excuse for not forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a friend, presuming to disgrace ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
                  </note> I am loath to vse a further preamble with you, then may sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d in equall poyse with your iudgement, and my dutie: yet because I would not seeme too peremptory, in iustifying my selfe, I will confesse, that vertue looketh with a more confident aspect, in the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a well gotten possession, then in the first Fortune of kinde embraces: so that I infer according to your own
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:2980:46"/>
proposition, that there is more cunning in keeping, then getting a Friend. But withall, if a Friend will so presume on the weaknesse of another, to tye him ouer-strictly to obseruation, or burden him with intollerable impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, because there hath passed vpon him some descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of gratuities: I see no reason to curbe his manhood, or libertie in such a fashion: especially, if the standers by be ignorant of their combination, or iealous that hee is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to some maligne circumstances of Fortune or Time: and thus much in generall. Now to the particulars: As you wonder at my repugnancie, and absolute contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your arguments in the last conference: I maruell that you would so apparantly maintaine such a <hi>Paradox:</hi> and amongst all the rest, draw mee into the circle of wrastling with our wittes, whereby either I must cowardly leaue poore truth in the hands of venomous, and corrupted <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phystrie:</hi> or fearfully bring my preuailing forces forward, to foyle your vnderstanding &amp; iudgement; whereby, in the contention, friends must needs fall out: wheras you won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that I would hazard your loue, by so sudden a deniall, of such an easie commaund, wherein better and greater Friends neuer disputed.</p>
               <p>I maruell why you should at that time, aboue all others, and before such persons, burst out to shewe your great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and power ouer mee, or discouer my weaknesse, onely to be insulted on, when you had attendants of your owne for seruile businesse; or might haue made some groome an actor in the same, to preuent all exceptions? Otherwise I sweare for honourable purposes, when the whole bodie shuld be exposed to your seruice, I would not haue denyed the Legges from going of an errand into the Kitchin for you. Whereas you wonder that I departed discontented, without ceremony, or making you once acquainted, when
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:2980:46"/>
all the companie wished mee well, and expected a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of the discourse. I maruell both at your putting mee to it, before such curious eares, and solid iudgements, and at the strange entertainme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t of a man, whom you know could not looke vpon mee, but with Basiliskes eyes: nor I endure him, without dislike and discontent. Therefore to preuent, vntoward disturbance, and to scatter my iealousie abroad, least it should gather a head of assurance, that you did it of purpose; I left you to murmure at my vnmanner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, but pleased my selfe in a supposed preuention of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mischiefe. Thus, if these sad lines haue better fortune then their maister, it may be you wil admit of them as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusatory, and of mee in them, as willing to please you in noble and iustifiable actions.</p>

Therefore I will plainely desire you to forbeare the debt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother yeare, that I may with a more cheereful looke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the spots and staines of my durty face, and so at lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure make it cleane, or with a stronger arme cast it lightly from my shoulders, when I shall haue time to rest my self; and prepare to stand firmely vnder the loade: otherwise, I may fall in making too much haste, and besmeere me the more in attempting with a foule &amp; filthy clout, rashly

Herein likewise you shall shew your selfe free from hard and griping exaction, wherein diuers vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers are compared to <hi>Harpies,</hi> who neuer seize on any thing, which they let goe without carrying something a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; nor ouermaster at all, where they doe not vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy.

Thus might I be terrified, because I haue heard some make a Tush at the motion, and knowe others ouer-daring to traduce him in priuate, and yet touched to the triall, disclaiming the least conceit of mislike.</p>
               <p>But if it please your Honour to bee your selfe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect your owne memory, I hope you will answere for vs both: For my selfe, that being my friend, and such a friend into whose bosome (when I shiuered for colde,) I haue shrowded my selfe for warmthe: I could doe little, if I would not preferre so easie a petition, to so noble a Lord, and such, as had brought mee long since, out of the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row entrie of suspition, to a manifest confidence of loue, and tyed his honour to the performance of a greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for my sake.

                  <hi>HOnourable Sir,</hi> I haue read, or at least, giuen eare vnto other folkes reading, that in ancient times, when ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and armes were mounted on a throne of estimation, there was a military oth prescribed to souldiers &amp; knights with diuers limitations: amongst which, repulsing of iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and defending of Ladies were principall; &amp; truely if a woman might bee admitted vnto a court of warre, mo thinketh it was necessarie and honourable. For what is vertue, but a naturall inclination to charitable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and noble resolutions? and how dare a Gentleman take vpon him the title of Chiualry, that will defile his heart with malicious and dangerous reuenges, open his mouth to vndecent speeches and filthy opprobry, stretch his hands to entertaine fury and reuenge; yea frame the whole course of his life, either to a bestiall liberty, or bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous doing of iniury? Therefore Noble <hi>Sir,</hi> remember your selfe, and from whence you are extracted, neere in alliance to me, and one, on whom I haue leaned for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation, and relyed in all these eruptions of misfortune. Remember mee a poore Gentlewoman, a widdow in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse, and groaning vnder the heauy and cruell hand of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:2980:53"/>
a great and mercilesse aduersary. Remember the cause, that it is vertues, the defence of chastity, and keeping vs al from penury and wants; and remember my aduersary, that he is meerely malicious; and because he could not obtaine, what he vnlawfully desired, hee now soundeth out no note but reuenge: and sweareth he wil make me repent, that I either denied, or contested with him. Therefore deare <hi>Sir,</hi> let me flie to you for refuge, and as farre as true manhood may auoyd the imputation of quarrels, and dangerous blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shedding, cling to your side vnder the shield of your noble protection: wherin I will desire you to proceed no further, then by petition to my <hi>H.

For questionles since our peace with <hi>Spaine,</hi> diuers of your company presuming on the same, haue improuidently set out weake shipping, and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:2980:59"/>
slenderly prouided; so that what with piracy, shipwracke, and the <hi>Florentines,</hi> and <hi>Maltesses,</hi> wee lost more within these fiue yeares, then we did in fortie before, when wee stood on our guard, &amp; prepared to encounter with exper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted foes. From the aduertisemenrs, of others we gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether abundell of these occurrences, that <hi>Ward</hi> had the fortune to take a <hi>Venitian Galeas,</hi> which hee brought into <hi>Tunis,</hi> cthad raised an estate by it, but that it miscarryed in harbour; that he liued there in great feare &amp; iealousie, both of the <hi>Bashaw,</hi> whom he was faine to bribe extraordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; of the Turkes, whom he onely corrupts with reward; &amp; of his owne followers whom hee suspected vpon the least discontentment would betray him to the <hi>Venetian,</hi> or send him to his Maiesties Embassadours: as for that smoaky re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port he carryed, it is nothing so; onely he liues in a house when he comes on shore, and is reasonable politicke, if he had any wealth, not to make shew of it for feare the <hi>Ianisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> themselues should rob him altogether. But in truth the spoyle hath bene farre greater of his piracies, then the goods orderly brought to land, and out of them so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>extractions, as there can little remaine to his owne share. For by that time the <hi>Bashaw</hi> is compounded with: the charges defrayed, the Turkes payed, and his owne company contented, there will be such an abatement, that out of ten thousand pound, his share and part groweth to an height of pride, if it raise it selfe to fiue hundred pound: and how deerely he must liue in the rate of housekeeping, euery passenger can tell.

                  <hi>WOorthy Sir,</hi> I was almost ashamed to write any thing from these parts,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Newes from Scio.</hi>
                  </note> as newes, or matter worth the inquiring after, but that I receiued a letter from you while I was in <hi>Scio,</hi> which seemed to command me, and taught me the way of good manners to satisfie your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. I would hasten to an end, lest some curious eye make a tush at these papers, when they examine, that I would fill a letter with such poore and common intelligences. I then came to <hi>Scio,</hi> of purpose to tarry for maister <hi>Bradshaw,</hi> whom we expected from <hi>Scandaron,</hi> but such was the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie and trouble of these times and places, that the <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> and <hi>Maltessis</hi> had sent out diuers ships to intercept the transportation of Turkes in any Christian vessell what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer, and lighting vpon him, put him to a dangerous fight, in which hee was sorely wounded, and had much adoe to come off with vtter destruction: so wee lost our passage, and spent our money in this Iland, where the Greekish women are extraordinarily beautifull, rich, and handsome: and the English Marchant liueth at great expences not daring to trust any of vs without good billes of Exchange, or good sufficient assurance of a better estate, then most commonly a traueller can enlarge. Wee did also heare that Maister <hi>Pindar</hi> our Consull at <hi>Aleppo,</hi> behaued himselfe very worthie of the best report indeede, and had much adoe in those Turkish tumults for to saue his life, and keepe the towne and Merchants from spoyling. Besides, at <hi>Scanderon</hi> a most intricate businesse about Maister E, a Merchant,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:2980:62"/>
and a Frenchman, who had contracted a bargaine for Gawls to the valew of 10000. dollers, raised his fame for the well contriuing, in sauing all their liues. For the Turkes maintaining iustice in the strictest manner, and punishing the least corruption that way with death, found an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to bring these parties to iudiciall triall, because it was supposed, that the Moore which sold them was deceiued in the weight by a corrupted Turke, who was the officer of the customes, and broken vpon the wheele vpon the first complaint: so that there was a present demand of the like iustice both on the English and French merchants; and was not determined without a great summe of money, and bribing the <hi>Bashaw</hi>: wherein there was no other face of preuention to be seene, then disbursment of a fine, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging a fault, and so with great difficulty the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was concluded. About the same time Master M. hauing beene some two yeare before surprised by the <hi>Maltesses,</hi> and then protesting neuer to be so ouermastred, or ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot, vndertooke a dangerous encounter betweene <hi>Sicilia</hi> and <hi>Candy</hi> with a <hi>Venetian Galeas,</hi> in a shippe called the Corslet. For comming toward the gulph, &amp; hauing some vncustomed, or peraduenture prohibited goods aboord: as also neglecting those nauall and marine ceremonies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate to the State, hee held it stubbornly out, rather then he would be searched, or abased in vailing his bonet, and so the fight continued a whole day, till he was hurt, &amp; many of his men slain, but being taken and ouer mastered he was carryed to <hi>Venice,</hi> where with much adoe his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie was obtained, to the great honour of Sir <hi>Henrie Wotton</hi> our Embassador, and contentment of the merchants, both here and at home.</p>

                  </note> While I lay ill at ease in <hi>Meteline,</hi> I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a letter from you, by the hand of Sir H.

Notwithstanding, I raised vp a pale face with a chearefull heart, and vnderstood by the same, that you desired a kinde of account concerning the Greeke Church, and Turkish gouernment. Truly your let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was most acceptable vnto me, as vnderstanding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the health of him I loue so well: but the contents af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted me, as knowing nothing could come from mee worthy your view, or bearing any shew of delight, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally satisfaction, considering the iudicious apprehension and great reading of the receiuer: yet againe, when I knew (if the worst fell out) I was to encounter with loue, and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill acceptation, I tooke aduantage of a day wherein my Feauer did not rage, and thus hudled vp this vnfashiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble peece, which if it resemble the confused lumpe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in nature helpeth the Beare in the deliuerance of her bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, you must with her industry, either reduce it to fashio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, or your owne goodnesse winke at the deformities. I will therefore begin with the Greekes, who are so enuious and malignant toward the Latines, that they had rather liue in seruitude vnder the Turkes, then require either aide or as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of the Romish Bishop, contesting with him euen from prioritie of place, and auncient possession of the Christian religion: so that in their account hee is but a meere vsurper of their glory and promotion, which hee hath ouermantled with diuises and mens traditions, that neither they can acknowledge him a father in the true Church, nor he them, as obedient children to his holy
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:2980:63"/>
Consistory. Concerning their ciuill gouernment, it is a meere mangled body. For no man possesseth either lands, goods, or scarcely their liues in securitie; but either the Turkes command makes them slaues, or the <hi>Timatriots</hi> or quartering of souldiers by the name of <hi>Capoges,</hi> or <hi>Spahies</hi> subiecteth all to licentiousnesse and incontinencie: they haue no munited cities, but vpon the frontires of <hi>Transilua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> and <hi>Hungary,</hi> nor permitted the possession of armour or munition: onely <hi>Gratianopolis, Andrinopolis, Philopolis, Salenica, Galipolis,</hi> and some townes in the Ilands are popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and ful of Edificies, but farre from their ancient beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or other cities of <hi>Europe.</hi> To conclude in a word, they are the meere pictures of miserable confusion, and ruines of time. Concerning their religion, it is so corrupted with age &amp; pride of precedency, that it will entertaine no refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; saying plainly, that <hi>Antioch</hi> was the first Christian Church, and the Greekes made the sheepe of Christs fold before euer <hi>Paul</hi> was carryed prisoner to <hi>Rome</hi>: as for <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> persecution, or being there at all, they absolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride it: and assure vs, that he was twenty year elders of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> and appointed the Apostle ouer the Iewes. In pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie they almost come neere the Primitiue Church. For their Monasteries are much diminished, and their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Congregations very small, and of little entrade: they denie purgatory, and the Popes supremacy, saying plainly, that if such a title were extant or necessary, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to <hi>Iohn</hi> Patriarch of Constantinople, with whom <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great of Rome, had many encounters to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse that tumour: they baptise with oyle and water, haue foure Lents, fast precisely, weare long haire like the Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, allow of no Saints but in the Bible, nor haue pictures in the Church but from thence: yet do they celebrate cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine feasts to Saint <hi>George. Nicholai</hi> and <hi>Demetrius,</hi> they are much giuen to mirth, and exceede in contraries. For
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:2980:63"/>
at their mariages they haue great pleasure and pastime: in their buryall great sorrow and lamenting, euen to the gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueling on the ground, and watching night and day ouer the graues. Many Countreys acknowledge their religion, as <hi>Russia, Georgia, Mengrelia, Armenia,</hi> and the people of <hi>Aethyopia,</hi> vnder <hi>Prester-Iean</hi>: Of whose particulars, you haue whole volumes; Amongst whom an vnderstanding wit may select the best, though many absurdities are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingled with some truthes.</p>
               <p>Concerning this Turkish gouernment, neuer came Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy to the height of such a preuailing. For there is no subiect of hereditary eminence but himselfe, and this <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror Sultan Achmat,</hi> is the 14. of the house of <hi>Othoman</hi>: the doctors of their Law called <hi>Alcharon,</hi> and the <hi>Mufty</hi> the principall Priest, rule the Empire, although it seeme mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vnder the gouernment of the 5. <hi>Vizeeres,</hi> &amp; other <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shawes:</hi> the strength of his kingdome is meerly supported by the <hi>Ianissaries</hi> &amp; souldiers, who are the sonnes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, and depend vpon the pleasure of their Emperour, as without eyther Friend or Parent, but the Turkes pension: They loue Iustice: punish Adultry with death: hate Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennes, and Blasphemy: doe nothing but to purpose: eate no swynes-flesh: nor should drinke any wine: They weare long garments: neuer vncouer the head, which is all sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, except one locke on the toppe, by which they suppose to be pulled vp to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> by <hi>Mahomet</hi> their great prophet: They haue many wiues &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>cubins to preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t adultry: they write bias, and read backward, as the Hebrues; and neglect all languages but their owne, <hi>Persian,</hi> and <hi>Arabian:</hi> None but of <hi>Mahomets</hi> race weareth greene, and all are obedient to their <hi>Bashaws</hi>: &amp; they absolute slaues to the Emperour; For their religion, it is full of great reuerence: They call to their churches or <hi>mosquees</hi> 4. times a day, by the voyces of men, on the top of a tower: and on friday (their sabboth)
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:2980:64"/>
5. times: No liuing thing is pictured or engrauen in theyr churches or <hi>mosqueis,</hi> to auoyde idolatry. The principall Priest is the <hi>Musti,</hi> of great account with the Emperour: For he &amp; the doctors of their law, ouer-rule in many ciuill things. The order of <hi>Deruices</hi> is sutable to the <hi>Capuchine</hi> friers, and are called <hi>Turners:</hi> They allow God the Father, but denye the <hi>Trinitie:</hi> They reuerence the three profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of the three religions: <hi>Moyses</hi> for the Iewes: <hi>Christ</hi> for the Christians: &amp; <hi>Mahomet</hi> for themselues: They hate in others prophanation or blasphemy, and obserue naturalls, mad-men, and fooles: They bury their dead with a singing noyse, and watch ouer the graues, with mourning &amp; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Infinit other particulars may be obserued, but these shall suffice, till a larger discourse can bring mee within the reach of your acceptation<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and shewe, how I haue not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed my time amisse: and am willing to giue you notice of the same; whome of all other men I would content in this kinde.</p>

               <p>This so startled the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and rowsed vp the drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie eyes of other Princes, that they al looked vp to see with what face these controuersies and accidentall displeasures, would terrifie the world: and not contented with verball protestations, they mustred their Armies, and at my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into <hi>Italie,</hi> I heard nothing else but the clamours of warre, and warre against the Pope himselfe. In which hurliburly, a noble man of <hi>Venice,</hi> of the house of <hi>Donatus</hi> now Duke, hauing bene long since <hi>Bandited</hi> by the State, for murthering a Gentl: to whose wife loue had formerly
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:2980:65"/>
enthralled him, determined to worke out his reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by prostrating his seruice to the State: and attending the same (if need and occasion required) with 50. Horsm: at his owne charge; and because they should not lay im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation vpon him of formalitie, and ceremonious braue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, from winde and smoake, he brought them by Sea into the Citie it selfe, and had licence to make a Martiall shew before the Ladies and better sort of the people: And thus in a sequestred place, at their <hi>fundamento nuouo,</hi> he mustred 50.Horsm: with reasonable equippage, and proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble discipline, which was neuer seene in <hi>Venice</hi> before. For there is neither horse nor cart, neither fresh-water, nor wholsome-ayre, neither sword nor cloake for the Gentl: of <hi>Venice</hi> himselfe: nor any pleasant walke to passe the time with recreation, more then the delicate entertainment in their <hi>Gondolas,</hi> and some comicall showes on their <hi>Grand-Canal:</hi> Amongst which, the rarest that euer I sawe, was a costly and ostentous triumphe, called a <hi>Regatto,</hi> presented on the <hi>Grand-Canal,</hi> to entertaine the Princes of <hi>Piedmont</hi> and <hi>Mantua,</hi> who came hither of purpose to see the Citie, and the pleasures of the same: which I must needs say for liberty of life and conscience, <hi>Curtesans, Mountebanks, Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sike,</hi> and <hi>Monasticall</hi> presumption, surpasseth any Citie in the world. The shew it selfe was briefly thus: diuers young Gentlem: according to their abilitie and willingnes, were selected by the order of their Balls, as Capt: of seuerall Barges, which were decked vp in orderly representations, of whales, vnicornes, dolphins, elephants, woods, fountaines, and such like: wherein all the Marriners and attendants, with seuerall warlike instruments, and musicke of lower sound, were placed, both for ornament, glorie, magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and adapted congruity, to the thing they attended: and thus they passed all in order, 2. English mile in length, vnder the <hi>Rialto</hi>-bridge: attended with infinite <hi>Gondaloes,</hi>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:2980:66"/>

                  <hi>NOble</hi> and worthy Friend: you and I may well vent out the breath of common prouerbs, that men may meet, but not Mountaines. For as I remember, we embraced in <hi>France</hi>: raunged ouer <hi>Ireland</hi>: yea, stamped in the durt, at <hi>Kinsale</hi>: encountred in <hi>Germany</hi>: saluted one another in <hi>Italie</hi>: played the wantons at <hi>Venice</hi>: and diuided our selues againe; as if the armes of the north &amp; south, should open a larger embracing: For you prepared for <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Ruscia:</hi> and I for <hi>Zidon,</hi> &amp; the bottom of the streights; where I receyued a letter from you so compendious and well compacted, that I protest I made vse, concerning the occurrences of those times and places: and receyued de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light from your inuention and phrase: not desisting, till I read and read it againe and againe; but when I came to your demaund of another of mine, for particulars, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the passage to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> I started backe, as if I had seen an adder in a path, and was afraid, as if some mischiefe indeed were threatned or intended; Not that there was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny difficultie in writing to my <hi>Friend,</hi> a Souldier and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensiue man, who could both pardon out of loue, and bearewith imperfections out of fauour: but because the papist will repine at my truth; the traueller complaine of my simpicitie; and the curious desirer of Nouelties make a tush at my information: For good Syr, howeuer the Templars out of their pollicie, and imposturing cunning, erected a kinde of structure, to make <hi>Ierusalem</hi> looke with some face of nouelty, and framed a Vault, in which they
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:2980:67"/>
deceiued the world, with the Tombe of our Sauiour: So that the adulterate daughter of religion, superstition, filled their Monastery and pallaces with infinite wealth and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, wherewith they made libertie and licentiousnes wanton with custome, &amp; filthy abuses: and for which they were condemned by a general councell, and the Papall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree: and howeuer some corrupted Pope hath since giuen way to diuers Pilgrimages, and permitted certain friers to reuiue former memories, and gather together the scattred stones of the first Monastery, whereby there is a way open to simple credulity, to belieue some thing, &amp; pay much for the same: yet without controuersie, since the last deuasta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that the Turke hath piece-meale rent asunder the goodly edifices of those places, as wee were woont to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime <hi>Nunc seges vbi Troiafuit:</hi> now corne growes where <hi>Troy</hi> stood: we may well crie out, now are there heapes of dust, &amp; some barren vines where <hi>Ierusalem</hi> florished: and according to his prophecie, that cannot erre, there is not one stone left vpon another: only the crafty Turks, &amp; the couetous <hi>Bashaw</hi> of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> the gouernor of those parts, are contented to beare with things euen contrary to the lawes of their <hi>Alcheron,</hi> impugning altogether the Godhead and incarnation of <hi>Christ:</hi> as the <hi>Iews</hi> against his pouerty and humiliation: &amp; for great sums of mony, &amp; <hi>annuall entrado,</hi> suffer stil diuers friers &amp; religious persons to entertain pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims, trauellers, ignorant deuotists, superstitious papists, and simple credulists, with impude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t, lying, &amp; deceitfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks.

Merchants make themselues strong, both in arms and prouision. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Thieues of those places, especially <hi>Arabia,</hi> would make a prey and spoyle of all passengers. This is all I can say, this is all I dare write, for feare of interruption: but if euer the sunne will make our shadowes meete in England, I will iustifie further particulars, and make you wonder, that so many wise and vnderstanding men as haue bene in these partes, will bee transported against the veritie of Scripure, and the infallible congruitie of iudgement and reason.</p>

                  </note> I neuer had such cause to remember the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers Banquet, as when I lay in <hi>Nicosia</hi> in <hi>Cyprus.</hi> For as I take it, <hi>Epictetes</hi> hauing inuited certain <hi>Stoyck</hi> phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers to dinner: for a latter ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>quetting-dish brought out the globe of the world: &amp; after they had called a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, <hi>Epictetes</hi> ouercouerd it with a fooles-cappe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at <hi>Heraclites</hi> wept bitterly, and <hi>Democrites</hi> laught heartily.</p>
               <p>The first bewalling the miserie, the latter, deriding the vanitie of the same: but if they had liued in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and seene such confusion of gouernment; all yet ouershadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Canopy of order and obedience to the State, it would questionlesse haue put them cleane out of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and turned their myrth into sorrow, and their sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes into raging and phrenzie. For the <hi>Bashaw</hi> expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting nothing but Tribute and legall iurisdiction, is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse how other Nations eyther liue with vpright consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or thriue with lawfull profite: So that the better sort practise what they list, because no man dare controwle, and inferiours follow all libertie and licentiousnes, because the others make way with ill example: The church-men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme religion, but for pollicie, and are onely proud: they can terrifie the simple with feare of damnation, and dazell the eyes of the ignorant with the gawdy colours of super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition. The <hi>Iewe</hi> is grown so cruell in his vsurie &amp; extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that wheras before it was much to forfeit goods and lands, now hee exacts vppon their very flesh and blood: glorying at nothing more, then to see penurie and wants eate vp a Christian: and coldnesse of charitie trouble his very soule. The Lawyer insults with the peace of the time, and to wring the gold out of mens purses, wrests the Law to theyr owne Fancies: so that they iustifie their actions
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:2980:69"/>
onely with legall authority. The Cittizen is bountifull in faire words, and so hee may make his merchandize venda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, hath learnd the tricke of <hi>aequiuocating,</hi> and deceyuing his best customers. The crafts-man studieth for nothing, but to be craftie in his cunning. The <hi>Courtezan</hi> resembles the horsleach, who neuer falls off till he be full: and when hee hath suckt the blood from the veynes, leaues a man to looke pittifully, on his sores and deformity. The Souldier sweates with rage, at that hee cannot remedie, and curseth peace, because it warres with his profit, nor will apprehend any goodnes, but in the ill of licentiousnes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Noble-women</hi> study for nothing but to seeme not to bee honest, yet haue they a clawse to affright inferiors for calling their actions in question: so giuing the more scope to their greatnes, to runne the more at random in pleasure. The <hi>Turkish</hi> wiues vnderstanding these particulars, repine at their Prophet, &amp; so murmur at their sequestration, that to haue some vse of the world, they visite the <hi>Balneas,</hi> come to buy iewells, make maskes in <hi>English</hi> atttyre; vse perfumes, and rather then they will not please themselues, allure their very slaues to carnall pleasure.</p>
               <p>To conclude, if euer the Diuell compassed the earth, and considered men, to make them subiects of hell, <hi>Cyprus</hi> is now a patterne; and the <hi>Turks</hi> there despise their <hi>Alcaron</hi>: the <hi>Iewe</hi> smileth at their Religion: the <hi>Christian</hi> derideth the scripture, and all men and people make a mocke of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and sanctifying graces, or the true-way to saluation: So that I am weary of this prophane countrey, and desire nothing more then the blessednesse of our owne <hi>England,</hi> where the very soyle is the reuiuer of our spirits, and good gouernment the load-starre to eternall felicitie.</p>
