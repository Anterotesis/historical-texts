                  <note>Contains twenty sermons. At the beginning of the eighteenth sermon (folio xxlxxix) Edgeworth states that he had abstained from preaching for five or six years, viz. during the reign of King Edward VI; consequently the former sermons were delivered in King Henry VIII's time and the rest after Queen Mary's accession--DNB.</note>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And therfore they that sawe the miracle done by our saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oure Christ vpon the man that was both deafe and do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored vnto his sight, and also to his speach, although they were bidde to make no wordes thereof, yet they consideringe the excellencie of the miracle, and perceiuinge the humilitie of the doer of the same, as intendinge more the occultation of his facte, for the auoidinge of worldlie praise, to geue vs example of like humilitie, then to hide his gratious cure, as thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge they shoulde not haue done well to let suche a marueilous worke vanish to obliuion, were the bu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sier to diuulge and publishe, not onelie that miracle, but others withall, sayinge: <hi>Bene omnia fecit, &amp; surdus fecit audire, &amp; mutos loqui.</hi> This man hath done all thinges
<pb facs="tcp:12050:4"/>
wel, he hath made the deafe to heare, and the do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me to speake. So I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidering that it hath pleased almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God of his plentuous mercie and goodnes, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen my mouth, and to make me occupied in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge his holie worde nowe by the space of fortie yeares and more, I thoughte it not good to permitte such matters as I haue (throughe Goddes helpe) set forth in my sermons, vtterly to rotte and perishe, and lest (as the morall Poete saieth) <hi>Deferar in uicum, uendente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thus, &amp; arhoma,</hi> I haue therfore perusing, yea rather su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficiallie runninge ouer suche sermons as I haue preached in times past, founde much good matter in them, right worthie to be had in memorie, and so compact and set together, that nowe in my olde age I reioyce in God that gaue me his gratious gift, so to trauayle in suche studie while I was yonge and lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie. These my longe labours hath be in the mooste troubleous time, and moste cumbarde with errours and heresies, chaunge of mindes and scismes that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was in this realme for so longe time together, that any man can rede of. VVhile I was a yonge stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in diuinitie, Luthers heresies rose and were scat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tered here in this realme, whiche in lesse space then a man woulde thinke, had so sore infected the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten flocke, first the youth, and consequentlie the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, where the children coulde sette the fathers to scole, that the kinges maiestie, and all the catholike clerkes in the realme had muche a do to extinguishe them, which yet they could not so perfitlie quenche, but that euer still when they might haue any main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce by men or women of greate power, they
<pb facs="tcp:12050:4"/>
burste out a freshe, euen like fire hidde vnder chaffe, whiche sometimes amonge will flame oute and do hurt if it be not loked to. Against such errours with their appe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deceis I haue inuehied ernestlie and oft in my sermons in disputations and reasoninge with the protestauntes, vntill I haue be put to silence, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by general prohibitions to preache, or by name, or by captiuitie and imprisonment, of all whiche (I thanke God) I haue had my parte. And yet euer whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I might haue any clere time, I haue retourned to the same exercise more vehementlie then afore, and so will do while I may haue strength to speake. And because these sermons were made in Englishe, and toucheth sometimes amonge, suche heresies as hath troubled English folke, I thought it best to set them forth in suche language as might presentlie best edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the multitude. Moreouer pleaseth you to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertised, that when I shoulde preache in any sole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pne and learned audience, I euer fearinge the labilitie of my remembraunce, vsed to pen my sermons muche like as I entended to vtter them to the audience: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers I scribled vp not so perfitlie, yet sufficientlie for me to perceiue my matter and my processe. And of these two sortes I haue kept (as grace was) a greate multitude, whiche nowe helpeth me in this my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise of imprintinge a boke of my saide exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Moreouer I haue made innumerable exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at my cures, and in other places where I haue dwelled, and in the countreis there aboute, and in my iourneis, where it hath chaunced me to be on sondaies, or other holie daies, of whiche I haue no
<pb facs="tcp:12050:5"/>
signes remaininge in writinge, althoughe I thinke verelie some of them were as fruitfull, as others in whiche I toke more labours, I praye God they maye be written and registred in the boke of life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinge. And when I shoulde preache oftentimes in one place, I vsed not to take euery day a distinct epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle or gospell, or other text, but to take some proces of scripture, and to prosecute the same, part one day and parte another daye, and so you shall perceiue by my declaration of the .vii. giftes of the holy Gooste, whiche I preached at Redcliffe crosse, in the good and worshipfull citie of Bristow, in sundry sermons, although I was interrupted many yeares by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacie of Hughe Lathamer, then aspiringe to a bisshopriche, and after beinge bishop of worceter, and ordinary of the greatest part of the sayd Bristow, and infecting the whole. And so by the exposition of the first epistle of S. Peter, whiche I preached also in manye sermons at the cathedrall Churche there, where I am one of the Canons, in this also I was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie times and longe disco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued by the odious scisme that was nowe lately, and by the doers of the same. And in like maner in the Cathedrall Churche of welles, on the first and second sondaies of Aduent, on Axe wednisdaye, and others, and there I lacked no trouble by bishop Barlowe and his officers, of which suche as be not perfourmed, I intend (if it shall please God) to perfourme and finishe hereafter.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that saint Paule sayth, <hi>semetipsum exinaniuit formam seruiaccipiens,</hi> He withdrewe his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie power fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his operacion, for if he had shewed it in his owne lykenes, all the worlde had not been able to haue receiued him. He kept a lower port, euer vsing humilitie and lowlynes, &amp; suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng the paynes of our mortalitie, with all the despites that the Iewes did to him, tyll in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion he came to his paynes on the crosse in his painefull passion. And that he withdrewe his power from his operacion in the tyme of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily presence heare on yerth appeareth euidently by this, that if it had pleased him, he might aswel haue indued his disciples with the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forte of the holy ghost whyle he bodily taried among them, as to haue differred it tyll the commyng of the holy ghost by sensible signes at this holy tyme of whytsontide. In a long sermon that he made to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> his disciples afore his passion among other hole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some lessons he sayd thus vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: <hi>Expedit vobis vt ego vada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp;c.</hi> It is for your profite that I go from you, for if I go not from you the holy ghost wyll not come to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort you. I haue yet many thynges to teache you, but as yet ye can not bear them away, but when the spirit of truth the holy ghost co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth, he shall teache you all truthes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarye for you to knowe. But good lorde what sayst thou? Nowe we can not vnderstande suche thinges as we be to be taught, &amp; than we shal vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derstand: How may this be? Is he greater of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer then thou art? Can he do more in teching vs then thou canst do thy selfe good maister? Christ
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:12050:17"/>
to auoyde this scruple &amp; doubt a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>swereth saying:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> No syrs, I do not say this for any impotencie in me, or for any inequalitie betwixt the holy ghost and me, for the thinges that he shall teache you &amp; shewe you, he shall not speake them of him selfe but of me. The cause why I say so, is this. <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia quae habet pater mea sunt, propterea dixi de meo accipiet &amp; annunciabit vobis.</hi> All thinges that my father hath, be myne: all power, all knowledge, all connyng be equally, and aswel in the sonne as in the father, and in the sonne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the father, like as he hath his generacion, production, &amp; beyng of the father: therfore sayth Christ, the holy gost shall take of myne and shall shewe it you &amp; teach it you, for when he shal sensibly come among you he shall shewe you my fathers pleasure, which is all one with my pleasure. All that he shal teache you he shall take and learne of my father and of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> me. Like as he hath his beyng of my father and of me, and as he is the infinite and ineffable loue of my father and of me. Thus sayd Christ vnto his disciples, for in very deede all the workes of the whole trinitie be al one &amp; vndiuidid outfurth among creatures. Loke what one person doth, the same thyng doth all thre persones likewise. Therfore there was nothing that the holy gost taught y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostles, but Christ could haue taught it them if it had pleased him. But he reserued &amp; left this power of instructing and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortyng the Apostles and others by them, vnto the holy gost the third person in trinitie, lest if Christ had done all himselfe, they would peraduenture haue
<pb facs="tcp:12050:18"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> thought there had be no holy ghost at all, or els that the holy spirit had not been of equal power with Christ, and with the father of heauen. In very dede afterward there risse a pernicious sect of heretikes, as Arrius and his faction whiche merueilously troubled al the world in their time, saiyng: that the seconde person in trinitie was but a creature and lesse of nature &amp; power then the father, And that the holy ghost was also a creature, and a minister and messager of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and of the sonne, and lesse of power then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them both. Because Christ would not haue his disciples to erre in this point, he reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the best porcion of learnyng &amp; of godly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from them, that the holy spirit might teache it them for their comforte, that so they might knowe the dignitie of the holy ghost, and might haue cause to glorifie and honoure him, likewise <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> as they honoured the sonne, and the father by the doctrine of Christ, whiche euer attributed and imputed all his lore &amp; instruction, preaching &amp; miracles doyng, vnto the father, as it is plaine in many places in the gospels. Therfore in as muche as they had heard muche of the power of the father, and had heard many holesome exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacions of their maister Christ, &amp; had seen many merueilous woorkes &amp; miracles done by Christ the very so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of God the father, and knewe very litle manifestly &amp; plainely of the holy spirit third person in trinitie: therfore as at this tyme by the high wisedome and counsell of the godhead, the holye ghost shewed himselfe lighting vpon the
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:12050:18"/>
Apostles in firie tongues, geuing them suche in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and knowledge, suche comfort &amp; bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as they neuer had before. And againe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they should not thinke the holy ghost grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of power then the father or the sonne, he war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them afore, saiyng: <hi>Quaecun ꝙ audiet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>quetur.</hi> All that he shall heare, he shall speake to you. As who should say, tho the giftes that he shal inspire you withall shall be wonderous, yet like as he hath his beyng of my father and of me, so al cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, knowledge and other giftes he hath of vs and equally with vs, like as he is equal and one in substaunce with vs. And in signe and token of his godhead and godly power, it foloweth there <hi>Et quae ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tura sunt annunciabit vobis.</hi> In this he shall specially shewe his godhead, because it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordeth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> most &amp; cheifly to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to knowe secretes to come after, and of his godhead it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth that men haue suche knowledge reueled vnto them, therfore Esaie sayth .xli. <hi>Annunciate quae ventura sunt in futuru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; sciemus quia dij estis vos.</hi> Tell vs what thinges shall come after, and so wee shall surely knowe that you bee goddes. This quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their spirites that our sauiour Christ tolde them, that the holy ghost should instruct them of thynges to come after, for there is nothing that mans mynde desireth more then to knowe what world shalbe hereafter, and what shall fall after our daies. And the Apostles were verye inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue in suche thinges, therfore many tymes they asked of Christ whether he went, and which was the way, and when he would come to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb facs="tcp:12050:19"/>
and when Ierusalem should be destroyed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and not one stone left on another. And when he would come to take his kyngdome vpon him, and what signe therof they shuld haue, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny suche other questions concernyng thinges to come. Of this thought &amp; carke of mynde our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ dispatched them, when he tolde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the holy ghost should teache them &amp; instruct them of all thynges to come that were mete and conuenient for them to knowe. Nowe this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposed of the godly power of our sauior Christ by whiche he might haue made his disciples as parfite in all giftes of grace as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghost did, and the cause why he did not so, descending to my principal purpose I will speake according to this holy tyme and solemne feast of the aboundance &amp; plentie of grace, with whiche his manhode was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> indued aboue al other men and wemen that euer had grace, And which he deriueth &amp; distributeth to all his faythfull people that receiueth grace. Of him the Prophet sayth, <hi>Psalmo .xliiii. Vnxit te deus, deus tuus oleo letitiae prae consortibus tuis.</hi> Kynges and preistes whiche bore the figure of Christe were annoynted with material and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible oyle, but Christ was annoynted of god the father w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the oyle of gladnes, that is to say, with the holy ghost, which was figured and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by the sayd material oyle. With this oyle of gladnes he was enbrued aboue al his felowes more excellently then any man whiche he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to take and vse as his felowes coinheritors and copartners of the ioyes of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. They haue
<pb n="iiii" facs="tcp:12050:19"/>
graces distributed to them seuerally by partes,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and the graces that one man hath, another man lacketh, and men hath them after a remisse and slacke maner, not fully nor perfitely: And they that haue graces of one kynde, yet some hath the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more fully and perfitely then some other hath. But Christes manhode had all graces after the highest maner that could bee geuen to any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. He was full of grace, not by measure, but aboue measure. Saint Stephan was full of grace, <hi>Stephanus plenus gratia. Act. vi.</hi> But howe? He had as much grace as was sufficient for him to preache Christ, and to suffre persecution and martyrdome paciently for Christes sake. And so is euery good ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and woman full of grace after a certaine sufficiencie, according to their nede, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> as it is profitable for them. The blessed virgin Marye was called in Gabriels salutation <hi>plena gratia,</hi> full of grace, by a special prerogatiue or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others, in asmuche as it pleased him of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> commeth all grace and goodnes, to take her in so gracious fauoure as to take his fleshe and bloud of her most pure virginal body. But the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>hode of Christ had all the giftes of grace after a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine excellencie and superaboundance, by which he might deriue and distribute grace to all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full people, euen like as the head in vs geueth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence to al partes of the body in the vse and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of all sensible mouinges as appeareth, for when the head is a slepe or mortified with Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seies or suche diseases, all other partes of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy be astonied and can do litle or nothing. And
<pb facs="tcp:12050:20"/>
contrary, when the head is of good temperature <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and well at ease, al the body is the better &amp; more apt in euery membre to do his office, by reason of suche influence as is deriued from the head vnto them. Suche influence of grace doth our sauior Christ geue to all christen people, for he is oure head and we his lymmes or membres, and that godly liuelynes of grace that we haue, we haue it of his store and plentie of grace. Of this store and plentie of Christes grace the blessed prophet Esay maketh mencion, speaking of the misterie of Christes incarnation, saiyng: capi .xi. <hi>There shal a slyppe or rodde spryng out of the rote of Iesse and a floure shall ascende out of his rote, and on him shall rest the spirit of God, the spirite of sapience and of vnderstanding, the spirite of counsell and of forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, the spirite of science and of pietie, and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> spirite of the drede of God shall replenishe him.</hi> By this slyppe or rodde is vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the humble vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Mary very flexible and plyant by humilitie. The floure ascending out of that rote signifieth the swete floure of our redemption, our sauiour Iesus Christ whiche rose and sprong out of the stocke and roote of Iesse otherwise called Isai, kyng Dauids father by the sayd slyppe or rodde Mary disce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding lyneally of Iesse by Dauid and by other holy patriarkes, And on this floure shal the holy ghost rest, with the seuen giftes of grace whiche be there called seuen spirites, because thei be the giftes of the holy spirite by appropriation thoughe they come of the whole trinitie as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sayd. Of these vii. giftes of grace that were
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:12050:20"/>
so excellently in oure sauiour Christ, and by him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> were distributed and diuided to all them that be apt to receiue them, I purpose (God helping) to intreate, partly this day, differring vntil another tyme or tymes (when it shall please God) them that I shall not haue leysure or oportunitie to speake of nowe. And here is to be noted for them that be learned, that the scholastical doctours be of diuers opinions in conferryng and comparing these seuen gyftes of the holye gost, to the seuen principal vertues, thre theological, Fayth, Hope and Charitie, &amp; foure cardinall, Prudence, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, Fortitude, and Temperaunce. And also to the viii. beatitudes that Christe speaketh of, <hi>Matth. v.</hi> And to the fruites of the spirite spoken of, <hi>Gala. v.</hi> So that by many diuisions and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diuisions they reduce al these seuen giftes of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> holy gost vnto the seuen principal vertues afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayd, &amp; also to the sayd beatitudes and fruites. And contrarywise they reduce all the sayd seuen principal vertues, beatitudes, and fruites, vnto these seuen gifts of the holy gost, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidering the scriptures expressing all one thing in substance, expresseth it in diuers places by diuers wordes. And now with more words, now w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> fewer: And in some place omitting that they expresse in other places. Other sayth ful reasonably,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sco. iii. di. xxxiiii. &amp; xxxv.</hi>
               </note> that Fayth, Hope, and Charitie be presupposed to all these seuen giftes, as the rote in a tree or in a plant is presupposed if the tree shall bryng furth leaues, blossons or fruites. And as we see that the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters axe or tole can do no worke except it be
<pb facs="tcp:12050:21"/>
handled of the workeman, and ioyned to him by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> such handeling or touchyng, euen so our soules be not moued to the exercise of any of these seuen gifts: except they be after some maner ioyned to the holy gost, which must be by faith, hope, &amp; cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritye. These be the very meanes to ioyne man to god &amp; to al godly exercise, therfore wher these be not, there the holy goste doth not inspire anye of his seuen giftes. Example we haue of S. Paule which though he were a vessel chosen to be reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with grace, yet he had not hys gyftes of grace furthwith after his stroke that he had as he was commyng vnto Damascus: but he was three dayes starke blinde and sore astonyed and afrayd, &amp; by this feare with praier &amp; fasting, he was prepared to faith, hope, and charitie, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently to aboundance and plenty of grace su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded to the graces of faith, hope &amp; charitye. Then seing that these three most necessary ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> be presupposed to the other gifts of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gost, if I should do <hi>que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>admodum sapiens archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectus,</hi> like a wise maister of the works, I should first intreate of them, as to lay the foundation a fore I begin to garnish the ouer and hier part of our spirituall building. But because I dout not but ye haue oft and many tymes heard of them at large, omitting them as presupposing the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacion to be alredy sufficiently layd, I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend to my principal purpose, aduertising you, that who so euer lacketh the said graces of faith hope, and charitie, and will not dispose hym selfe by prayer to obtaine them: he shall vnprofitably
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:12050:21"/>
heare any preaching of the foresaid seuen giftes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of the holy goste. Then supposing the best that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one of vs hath them, let vs prosecute &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede to intreate of these seuen giftes, and first of the first gift, that is, the <hi>spirite of sapience,</hi> or the gift of sapie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. And because that (after the minde of the Logicions) where is anye equiuocation, first we must make a distinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> afore we giue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions, therfore it is to be noted that <hi>sapience or wisdome</hi> is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> foure maner of waies, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth <hi>Iacob .iii.</hi> where the apostle asketh this question: Is there anye one amonge you wise or wellearned? If ye will say yea, then sayth the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, let him shew that by his workes, <hi>In man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suetudine sapientiae,</hi> curteisly, tractably, or gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordering his wysedome. Where contrarye if ye haue bitter zeale and enuye in your hartes with striuing and brawling, you nede not to be proud, deceiue not your selues, for thoughe you thincke your selfe neuer so wise and iolye fellowes, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> thou scolding woman neuer so iolye a dame, yet this is not the wisedome that commeth from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, from God almighty, the giuer of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: But this is earthly wisedome, beastly wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and diuelish wisedome, where ye haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed foure maner of wisdomes, <hi>wisedome that commeth from heauen</hi> of Gods gift, and three o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wisdomes that commeth of our gostly ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Let vs exclude these three, and we shal the soner perceyue, vnderstande, and beare awaye what the godly wisedome is. One of these three noughtie wisdomes S. Iames calleth earthlye
<pb facs="tcp:12050:22"/>
wisedome, and that is it that couetous men be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> combred with all, whych be euer like wantes or Moles moiling in the grounde, and when they shuld asce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d aboue such worldlines to godly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditacions, as to here sermons or diuine seruice, they be as blinde as the Molle. Either they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perceiue any thing of godly or heauenly cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sail, or if they perceiue it, yet they haue no swete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in it, but down they would headlong to their lucre and aduauntages againe, like as a Molle if a man would feede her with wine and wastel, she will none thereof, but downe againe to the ground she will, and there she is more strong the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Lion, and after her maner wiser then anye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beast. Example of this earthlye wisedome we haue in the gospel <hi>Luc. xvi.</hi> when Christ said <hi>No man can serue two masters,</hi> and <hi>ye cannot serue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> God and your riches,</hi> it foloweth, <hi>the Phariseis that were riche, heard al these thinges, &amp; laughed Christ to scorne.</hi> So if a man do preach or exhort the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous men not to put to muche affiaunce and confidence in the vncerteinty of their riches a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shall haue a mocke or a shrewd word. But let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beware of the comminacion that is writ. <hi>Luk. vi Ve vobis diuitibus qui habetis hic co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>solationem ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stram.</hi> Wo be to you riche men, whiche haue your consolation and comfort here in this world. <hi>Ve,</hi> is a comminacion of payne euerlasting, whyche shall fall vpon theym, beside the temporall woe and pain that they haue in keping their goodes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for they be rather possessed and holden of theyr goodes, then possedeth and holdeth them.

they haue their goodes, as we say a man hath a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> paire of fetters or shackels vpon his legges, more to his paine then to his pleasure.

<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:12050:24"/>
said to him: I haue done as thou hast said. <hi>Dedi tibi cor sapiens &amp; intellige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in tantu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vt nullus ante te <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> similis tui fuerit nec post te futurus sit.</hi> I haue geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee a heart indued with Sapience and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, in so muche that among all the kinges of Israell that haue bene afore thee, or that shall come after thee, there was neuer none like thee. Here ye haue expresse mencion of the two firste giftes of the holy gost, <hi>Sapience</hi> and <hi>Intelligence,</hi> wittines or fine and cleare vnderstandyng. Of the which, Sapience properly serueth for iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in speculatiue causes, chiefely concernyng almighty God, and celestiall creatures and veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or truthes about the same, iudgyng and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining that to them a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shold surely adhere &amp; leyne, &amp; to refuse the contraries, as false &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the truth. And I must nowe speake vnitely or ioyntly of the gift of sapie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gift of intelligence or vnderstandyng, as the prophet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Esay rehearseth them coupled and linked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, because one of them adourneth and helpeth another. For Sapience is much the lesse if it lack Intelligence or wittines. And wittinesse with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out discrete iudgement of Sapience is very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable. And euen like, the gift of counsayle without fortitude or manlinesse is of no price: Nother manlines without counsell or good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisement. No more is science without pietie or pietie without the discretion of science. And fear muste haue some of the saide giftes concurrent with it, or els no good will come of it. Then to our purpose. Because that our knowlege natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb facs="tcp:12050:25"/>
beginneth at some of our fiue exteriour or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> outward senses, which we call the .v. wits, if our knowledge shall be eleuate aboue that his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon course to heauenly matters, as be thinges parteyning to our fayth, it hath nede of some su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall light, by whiche it may ascende and pearce into the knowledge of such thinges as by his natural power he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not attayne to. As that there be three persons in one substaunce of the Godhead. And that the father by his fecund and fruteful memory produceth and getteth his one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten sonne the second person in trinitie: And that the father and the sonne by their fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunde and frutefull will bringeth forth the holye gost coeternall, and of equall might and power with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both. And y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> that one God thus distinct in thre persons by his endles and mighty power <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> at his pleasure, and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he thought good, made all the world of nought. And that by his onelye goodnes he mainteneth and preserueth the same so that if he would once withdrawe his hande of maintenaunce but one little moment from hys creatures: they should sodainely fall to nought as they came fro. And that all the glorious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of aungels he made to honour him, like as all other creatures, after their kindes and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners doth. And where as some of the aungelles swarued from the grace that they were creat in, and were damned to be the horriblest creatures and in most payne of all creatures of the world, the others persistyng &amp; standinge in their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, were confirmed in grace, so that now they
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:12050:25"/>
can not fall, but continuallye remayneth in the glorious fruition, sighte, and loue of God, euer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ready to do his commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in heauen, and at his pleasure here in earth toward vs mortall men. <hi>Hebr. i.</hi> These and such high misteries of heauenly matters to perceiue, and as it were by the sharpenes of mans witte to pearce into the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, (as man may here in this grose and corruptible bodye) perteyneth properly to the gifte of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standynge, <hi>Ad donum intellectus.</hi> And the more perfectly that this gifte is inspired into man, by the holy gost: the more distinctly and plainely he shal perceiue such hie secrets, though perceue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he shall do hereafter in glory, we can not yet. And by mature and wise iudgement to discerne these verities from their contraries, perteyneth properly to the gifte of Sapience, or godly wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. <hi>Ad donum sapientiae.</hi> As to discerne one God from the false Gods: To know that the .iii <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> persons in Trinitie be equall in power, and not one of them minister or seruaunt to the other, as <hi>Arrius</hi> saide. To know that there is but one ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of all thinges, &amp; no more, and not to put two creatours, one of good thinges, an other of euyl thinges, as <hi>Manicheus</hi> saide. And to iudge when the angels of God doth trulye Gods message. And to discerne them from the aungels of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, which many times disguise them selues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fashion of the angels of light. These and such other hye iudgementes in heauenly causes, ꝑteineth properly to the gift of sapience or god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wisdome. For this supernaturall gift of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pience
<pb facs="tcp:12050:26"/>
the wise man prayed. <hi>Sapi. ix. Da mihi se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> tuarum assistricem sapientiam.</hi> Geue me the wisdome from aboue that is euer assistent bi thy seat of glory, and from thence is deriued and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused or send downe to menne. Because that, <hi>Si quis erit consummatus inter filios hominu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, si ab illo fugerit sapientia tua in nihilum computabitur.</hi> If a man be neuer so profound and excellent in mans wisdome, if he lacke this godlye wisdome (good Lord) he shall not be estemed wise, but rather a fole, in as much as worldly wisdome is counted but folishnes afore God <hi>.i. Corin. iii.</hi> And the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Dauid prayed that he might obtayne thys supernaturall gift called <hi>Donum intellectus,</hi> the gift of intelligence, wittinesse, or fine and cleare vnderstandyng, saying: <hi>Psal. cxviii. Da mihi intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectum vt discam mandata tua.</hi> Geue me intellige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that I may learne thy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandementes. Where it is highly to be noted that this noble king and prophet whiche so well knew Gods lawes, and that saide he had kept Gods eloquent sayinges, yet nowe he prayed for finer and clearer vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standyng, by whiche he might yet better ascende and pearce into the same. And we haue nede so to pray as the prophet did, that this gift of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence may be geuen vs to helpe our fayeth, like as in many cases our faith helpeth our intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence or vnderstandyng, accordyng to the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Esay. vii. Nisi credideritis, non intelligetis.</hi> As saint Augustine and others redeth that let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Excepte ye beleue, ye shall not vnderstande. For many thinges there be whiche except ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue,
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:12050:26"/>
ye can not vnderstande, as the articles of our fayeth, with other like. And many truthes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> there be, that we can not beleue except we haue vnderstandyng, either by hearyng the preacher, by instruction, or by study, as Paule sayth: <hi>Ro. x Fides ex auditu auditus autem per verbum Christi.</hi> And this is acquisite fayth gotten by laboure, studie, or hearyng: and so is vnderstandyng pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porcionablye to the same, whiche bothe be made more firme, fast, and certaine, by fayth infused, and by Intelligence or vnderstandynge infused and geuen from aboue of the holy gost. And this gift of Intelligence is neuer withdrawen from good men, specially about such thinges as be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for mannes saluation to be knowen, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though some men haue it in a higher degree the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> some other haue: but about other thinges not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> necessary to be knowen, it is withdrawen, to pul men downe, that the matter &amp; occasion of pride and curiositie may be taken away, and lest men should be to proud of gods gifts: and accordyng to this speaketh saint Iohn. <hi>i. Ioh. ii. Vnctio eius docebit vos de omnibus.</hi> The oyntment, infusion, or inspiration of the holy goste will teach you in all thinges necessary to be learned, although ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good men hauyng the grace that maketh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> acceptable and in the fauour of God, may be dul and little or nought perceiue of other truthes, without whose knowledge a man maye come to heauen wel inough. Chrisostome in a sermon <hi>De spiritu scto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> vseth a more familier &amp; playner di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of these two giftes, Sapience, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence,
<pb facs="tcp:12050:27"/>
saiyng: When it besemeth a doctour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> or a teacher to speake plainely, his gifte is called the spirite of Sapience. And where nede is that the hearer do wittily perceiue that is spoken, the gifte that he muste haue, is named the spirite of vnderstanding, which also is called the spirite of reuelation, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nede is to learne profound mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. <hi>Reuela oculos meos &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>siderabo mirabilia de lege tua.</hi> sayth the Prophet. Reuele or vncouer mine eyes, drawe the curtayne from afore the eyes of my soule by this gift of intelligence, and I shal consider marueylous thinges of thy law. The spirite of Sapience (sayth Chrisostome) is geuen to the teachers, and the spirite of Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and vnderstandyng is geuen to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers. I preache, thou vnderstandest, and takest the minde of my saiynges hauynge the gifte of Intelligence, although thou canst not teach. As <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the Preacher by the spirite of Sapience iudged what was best to be vttred and expressed for thy erudicion: so thou by the grace of Intelligence takest his words as they be meant, and learnest that is for thy soule health. Almighty God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge to shewe, that as he sendeth the spirite of Sapience to the teacher, so he sendeth to the learner the gifte of Intelligence, that he maye perceiue suche thynges as be Godlye. Geueth to the mouth of the Preacher the grace of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pience and to the hearte of the Learner the grace of Intelligence. Sapience is the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of the mouth, and Intelligence is the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:12050:27"/>
of the hert. Therfore sayeth the Prophete. <hi>Os meum loquetur sapientiam &amp; meditatio cordis <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> mei prudentia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Psal. xlviii.</hi> My mouth shall speake Sapience or wisdome, and the recordyng of my hert shall shew prudence, intelligence, or vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standyng, perceiuyng the thyng y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I am taught. Yet here you must diligentlye note, that perfite Sapience is not so much to knowe Goddes elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, as for to liue accordynglye to Gods elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and to his holy worde: And Intelligence is little worth, where a man worketh not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to that he hath learned. But what shall I say of them, that hearyng Gods eloquence dayly declared vnto them, yet hauyng their mindes oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied aboute other businesse, regardeth not to beare away that they heare, and will not learne and vnderstande to do well accordynge to that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> they learne. And what shall I saye of them that may get vnderstandyng, and wil not come wher as they maye haue it? but when they heare of a sermon toward, will get them selues out of the church, fainyng some busines to excuse their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, or els will get them to the Alehouses, or tauernes, or els wil sit talkynge on the crosse in the churchyard, or on the churchyard walls, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge other as lewde as they be them selues by their yll examples, so that for all the preachinge that is in their townes where they dwel, they be neuer the better, but much the worse, whose iust da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation by gods iuste iudgment must nedes fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low as I could declare abu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dantly if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time wold
<pb facs="tcp:12050:28"/>
permit. Yet one thing I wold faine discusse by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> way without any great digressio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal matter: &amp; it is this: in this case now touched, that is to say, when the person, vicare, curate, or preacher, perceiueth that few men or none be the better for his preachynge, whether then and in that case the preacher ought or may ceasse from preachyng, as thinkyng his sapience, his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and his learnynge in Gods scriptures yll bestowed amonge them, because they regarde it not, and be neuer the better for it, hauyng none intelligence or godly wittinesse gendred or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in their mindes, neither any reformation or amendement in their liuings, nor in their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, by al the labours of the curate, or the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher? For this ye shall vnderstande, that though the negligence of the audience disco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forteth and discourageth the preacher greatly, yet he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> so geue ouer and ceasse, bicause of Gods commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and threatening by his prophet <hi>Ezech. iii.</hi> saiyng: <hi>that if the watch of Israel, the curate, or prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher se his flocke do noughtielye, and will not tell them of their fault, nor rebuke them that they may amend, he will require and aske their bloud of him.</hi> He shall aunswere for them at the day of dome, Naturall examples we haue to encourage and comfort the preachers in this behalfe, that he be not dismayed but take pacience. For we se by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that the veynes of waters floweth and runneth, although no manne come to water his cattell at them: and welles although no manne draw vp water at them, yet they sprinkleth, boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:12050:28"/>
and welleth vp. And brookes, although nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> man nor beast drinke of them, yet neuer the lesse they kepe their course and floweth. So he that preacheth must lette hys veyne of sapience flow and runne among his audience, althoughe no man drinck of it, take hede vnto it, or receiue it. In this case was <hi>Hieremy</hi> the prophet, when he saw no profitte or encrease of vertue come by hys prophecienge and preachynge, but rather persecution and trouble, mockinge, laughinge, and scornynge, by whyche he was once mynded to surceasse and leaue of, preaching, Yet he saith: that <hi>sermo domini factus est in corde meo, quasi ignis exestua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s clausus<expan>

                  </expan> in ossibus meis, et defecifer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re non sustinens. cap. xx.</hi> The woorde of God was like flaming fyre in my hart (saith this prophet)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and it was closed wythin my bones, so that I left my former purpose, and coulde not forbeare to speake in Gods name. Then if he were thus vexed in kepyng silence, what shall become of vs if we ceasse, specially where none such perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution is as he suffered, but rather where manye taketh good heede and would fayn learne? Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny profites co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth by declaryng the woorde of God, which shoulde comfort and encourage the preacher to be doing, not wythstanding that the audience be negligent: One is, that noughty per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sones remembring a sermon wil be abashed and ashamed of them selfe, and will not be so shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse to do as they were wont to doe. As when the preacher speaketh against riatours, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne hunters, the vnthrifte remembringe the
<pb facs="tcp:12050:29"/>
holy word, will be more ashamed when he goeth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> into the tauern the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was wont to be. This is a certeine kinde of feare called <hi>verecundia,</hi> bashful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes or shamefastnes, it is <hi>timor ex expectatione connicij,</hi> a feare of reproche or rebuke, least anye man would chide or checke him, or say yl by him. This is a very good affection, therfore, if by our preaching yet at the least wise such an affection may be strike<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into the hart of any one of our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, we may be glad of it. An other vtilitie &amp; profit is, although by my preaching I make not all men better, yet some men be the better there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and they that be good, be more modest and vertuous by my sayings. And although I haue not set vp them that be sycke, yet them that be whole I haue made stronger to stande in theyr goodnes, and more stedfast. The third profit, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> I haue not perswaded men to daye, yet to morowe I maye peraduenture, and if not to morow, I may the next day after, or the fourth day, or in tyme to come. Example we maye take of a Fisher and the fish that longe nibleth at his bayte, yet at the last he is taken and cast on lond<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Likewise a husbandman, if he wold giue of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ploughe, because he seeth distemperaunce and troublous weather manye tymes, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth hys labour and cost, we shoulde all dye for hunger. Lykewyse the shypman or the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunt, if for one storme or twayne, or one losse or twayne, he should abhorre and giue of goyng to the sea, there would at the last no man auen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the seas, and then farewell this citye of
<pb n="xiiii" facs="tcp:12050:29"/>
Bristowe and all good trade of marchaundyse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and occupying by sea. The husbandman often laboreth and breaketh one peece of grounde, and litle or nothing gayneth, yet at last recouereth in one yeare the losse of many yeres afore. And the Marchaunt man although he hath had losse by shipwracke diuers times, yet he absteineth not to passe and seke out straunge portes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times auentreth on hys olde busynes with a Cabao, gathered of borowed money, and dothe full well, and commeth to great substaunce and riches. Then considering that these men besto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth so great studie and labours about transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie things that will perish: shall we by and by surcesse and leaue preaching, if we be not hearde as we woulde be. Their condicion and ours is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> not like: they lose both labours and cost, but we shall be sure to receiue rewarde of God for oure labours, for we haue done that we be bounde to do, we haue layde our Lordes money to vsurye and for increase, as he biddeth vs do. Moreouer consideryng that the diuel neuer despayreth our destruction, but euer looketh for it wythout rest, shall we despayre the health &amp; saluation of our brothers? Christ that knew well al thinges that should come after, ceassed not to admonishe and teach Iudas, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he knew wold neuer be good, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what shal we do toward our brothers which we knowe not whither they will be good or no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

anguish, lest he should publish and vtter the trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and should make him past shame by many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest and open reprofe.

Thys he persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by two examples, firste of one <hi>Theudas,</hi> whyche (after Iosephus) vsynge superstitious craftes, toke vpon hym to be a great Prophet and so deluded the people, that he made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of theim to sell their goodes, and care for nothynge but to folowe hym. And so brought a greate multitude after hym to the water side of Iordane, to the noumber of foure hundred disciples, where he promised them wythin thre dayes nexte folowynge, to deuide the water, and to go ouer with them drye shodde as Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue did wyth hys companye. But whyle they were tariynge for thys myracle, came on them the Capitayne of the countrey wyth hys Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye, and strooke of <hi>Theudas</hi> heade, and destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and scattered all his secte and retinue. After him came an other, <hi>Iudas Galileus</hi> which brought
<pb facs="tcp:12050:34"/>
vp among the people a pernitious errour, that it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> was not lawfull for them to pay any tribute to the Emperour, or to any other alien, because thei were the elect people of God, and payed to God first fruites, tithes, and offerynges, with other dueties. This pleased the people wonderouslye well, because it set them at an vnlawfull liberty whiche carnall people moste desireth. And so a great multitude folowed him, whiche sone after were all destroyed wyth hym. To my purpose, (saith Gamaliel) it is best ye let these men alone, for if the counsayle and way that they take and folow, come of mannes inuention by any carnall and worldlye cast, it will be broken, it will not hold nor continue, no more then the enterprise of <hi>Theudas,</hi> or of <hi>Iudas Galileus</hi> did. But if it come of God ye can not breake it, it will stande, it will prospere and go forwarde, ye can not let it, except ye will repugne against God, which no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> mans power is able to do &amp; to preuaile: repugne it may as al sinners doth, but preuaile it can not Of these thre stories compact in one ye se plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that where so euer in any counsaile men work on Gods halfe, hauyng Gods pleasure afore their eyes, the counsayle goeth forward.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Menne can tell well inough by science and good learnynge what to make of it, but by experience no man can tell what it is, but he that hath bene there. But now to declare and to proue Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory by scriptures with the expositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of auten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall doctours, thoughe it be very easy, because the matter hath bene so laboured among clerks, yet I should make to great a digresson from my principall purpose, which is to declare vnto you this thirde gyft of the holy gost, the gift of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayle, whiche as I saide, is not grounded on car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalitie, nor bringeth any man to carnall liberty. As in very dede this opinion of no Purgatorye dothe. Here I will not contende aboute this vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Purgatory, I meane the middle or meane place betwixt heauen and hell, in whiche some soules be stayd afore they can come to that most pure and cleane citye, into which nothing can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> excepte it be of the cleanest sorte. For whiche place if I coulde imagine a more accommodate and conuenient vocable or terme, I woulde be glad to vse it, bicause the scriptures hath not the sayd word Purgatory. Albeit, I knowe ryght well that in all Scripture wee reade not this worde <hi>Trinitas,</hi> or thys woorde <hi>Consubstancialis,</hi> yet God forbid that we should denye the blessed Trinitie in the Godhed, the sonne to be consub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanciall and of one substance with the father, or the holye gost to be of one substance with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the sonne, <hi>Arrius</hi> that pernicious here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike when he was conuinced and compelled by aucthorities and reasonynge to graunte that all

three persons in trinitie were of one and equall substance, had none other refuge, but to sticke in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the vocable or terme <hi>homousion,</hi> that we call in latine <hi>consubstantialis,</hi> or <hi>vnius substantiae,</hi> and in Englyshe, <hi>of one substance,</hi> because that word is not vsed in scripture, he would none therof, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe he could not denye the thinge: a poore cloke of defence (God knoweth) to graunte the thinge, and to varye in the name. Therfore so that I might agree with this audience, and they with me, that there is suche a staye and a meane place of punishment after this life, I would not care thoughe I neuer called it Purgatorye, but let A. be his name. To denye the sayde A. and to say y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there is no such thing, bringeth a man to a carnall libertye, and geueth man occasion bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to continue in sinne to hys liues ende, trusting then to crye God mercye for his misliuynge, and then to go through (as they speake) I trow they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> meane to go by and by to heauen, as well as he or she that hath liued in vertue &amp; prayers, paine, and penance all the dayes of their liues. And so shoulde they be in beste case, that be lechers, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouterers, couetous, brybers, and oppressioners and extorcioners, vserers, periurers, dicers, and carders, hunters, and haukers, and all suche of the worst sort: where contrarye the true beleue that he that hath not done condigne and conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient penaunce here, shall be punished greuously, accordynge to the grauitie of his misliuynge, afore he enter into that most clere and pure city, (though god may of his absolute power forgeue

such alonge misliuer for one woorde of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> at his laste ende.) Yet this will make a manne beware of him self, and to amende his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge, surely thinkyng (as the truth is) that for his vicious pleasures in whiche he hath delited in his lyfe tyme, and hath not sufficiently satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for hys faulte he shall haue afore he come to heauen, suche punishement and payne as the lest parte therof shall greue hym more then all his vnlawefull pleasures haue done hym solace or comforte.

So now because the bodies be out of pain, we say the men rest or slepe in the slepe of peace.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> And because the soules be departed in the state of grace, and in the way of saluation which they haue not yet perfitly obtained: we pray that thei may come to the place of refreshing, to the place of light, and to the place of peace euerlasting in heauen.

And I would they should not so rashely precipitate their sentence in such weighty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, except they had some better ground. Thys <hi>precipitatio</hi> headlong shofyng out mens sentence without iudgement, is contrarie to thys gift of the holy gost, that we now entreate of the gyft of counsaile, as I touched afore. This was the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> faut of Iepthe <hi>Iud. xi.</hi> which when he should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede to battell against the Ammonites, he made his vow to God <hi>precipita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter</hi> headlong and rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without counsel or aduiseme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> what so euer came first against him to meete him at his dore, after his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming home, he would kill it &amp; offer it vp to be burned in sacrifice to almyghtye God. So it chaunced that when he came home after his victory, his own doughter (which he had and no mo children) met him with timbers and such instrumentes of melodie as she had to welcome him home. When he saw her, he tore his clothes and cryed: alas my doughter, thou hast deceiued me, and art deceiued thy selfe. This precipitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hurt king Dauid, notwithstanding his great

wisedome and manyfolde vertues, when he fled <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> from the persecution and commotion that hys own sonne Absolon raysed against him, one <hi>Seba</hi> that was seruant to Miphiboseth (Ionathas sonne, neuew to Saul the kyng) came to kynge Dauid, and brought him presents of such dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as myght do hym pleasure, and to hys ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes in that distres and trouble.

When Moyses had heard Iethroes counsail, he did all thinges as he counseld hym. Nowe to my purpose, because no man shall be proude of the giftes that God hath gyuen hym, we maye see here that Moyses hauyng so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently the gift of sapience to iudge and discerne and also to teache and instruct in Godly causes, yet as then he lacked the gift of counsail, which

            <p>It was no small enterprise among so vnruly,

wilfull and sturdye a multitude as that people <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> were, to bring such a newe rule, and to set so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate a Ierarchie among rulers, of which some should be lower, some higher, ordinatelye vntyll they came to Moyses in arduous matters, and causes of difficultie, and at the last to almightye God, where the causes emergent were aboue Moyses capacitie: For that people was so hye harted that they would not easely go to the fote, but they would for euery trifle go to the head, or els they woulde not be ruled nor pleased.

And yet we Christen Philosophers muste pare away somewhat more of that he leaueth, and so afore we haue al done, we shall see that this morall vertue like as all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther morall vertues withoute the assistence and grace of the holye goste be as Esaye sayth .lxiiii. <hi>Quasi pannus menstruatae omnes iustitiae nostrae,</hi> be filthy and ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

consisteth in the meane and middle betwixt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> two vices, and because the extremities somtime haue no name, we expresse them by circumlocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, sometime by two or three thinges for one, and sometime by negatiues: As here <hi>inpauidus</hi> wythout feare, is one extremitie of this vertue fortitude, such a one is he that nothing feareth, neither earthquakes, fire, nor water, but suche a one semeth rather insensate and mad, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bold. Likewise in boldnes or venturousnes, he that will auenture where is no likelyhoode to scape, is in thys extremitie of fortitude, and is called folishehardye, and semeth to be proude and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous rather then bold, a fainer or cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faiter of boldnes, rather then truly bold or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For comonly such men hath a certein feare of hart inwardly annexed to their boldnes, begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning boldly, and at the last will run awaye with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> shame. He that excedeth in the other extremitye and contrary part, that is feare is called comon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>timidus,</hi> a cowarde, afrayde of his shadowe, or where is no cause why he should feare. Such be they that in all perils despayreth, their hart fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them, cleane contrary to fortitude or manly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, whyche hathe euer good hope to ouercome, where by the iudgement of reason is any likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to ouercome. So that generallye fortitude is exercised about feares and boldnes or hardy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as it were to suppresse and correct feare, and to moderate and measure hardines or boldnes. Certein conclusions the Philosopher putteth in which we Christen men varie from him. One is
<pb facs="tcp:12050:43"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> this: He that desireth rather to dye then to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine aduersitie, as pouertie, shame, reproche, or rebuke, is not manly, for such (after him) haue a certain feare in them, and worketh rather of a tendernesse or nashnes of hart, then of fortitude or manlinesse. Contrary to this we rede of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das Machabeus the valiant captaine, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Lisias protectour of that huge part of Asia, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the riuer of Euphrates, and the ryuer of Nilus, in the absence of Anthiocus the king had send by the commaundement of the sayde kyng into the land of Iuda .xl. M. footemen, and .vii. M. horsemen to inuade that land, and to destroy it handsmothe, so that there should remayne no memorie of the Iewes in all that lande. Then this noble captain Iudas Machabeus gathered his people together, and after fasting that daye, with feruent and deuout prayer to God, made a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> solempne exhortacion to hys people, where he saide to my purpose: <hi>Melius est nos mori in bello quam videre mala gentis nostrae et sanctoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> .i. Mach. iii.</hi> It is better for vs to dye in battail, then to se the trouble &amp; paines of our nacion &amp; of holy me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Wher he preferred death temporal to experience of misery &amp; chosed rather to dye, then to sustaine the calamitie, wretchednes &amp; shame, that they should come to, if their enemies shoulde haue the ouerhand ouer them, &amp; yet the true fortitude &amp; manlines in Iudas Machabeus passed the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines of al the paignim co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>querours that Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle could recite. Aristotle saith also: <hi>fortis quanto est virtuosior &amp; felicior, tanto fit in morte tristior<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
               <pb n="xxviii" facs="tcp:12050:43"/>
A manly man the more that he hath of that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> &amp; the more felicitie that he hathe, the more heuy &amp; sorowful he is at his death, because that by death he is depriued &amp; disapointed of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test felicitie, benefit, &amp; goodnes that may com to man, which felicitie (after him) maye be gotten in this world. For though they put an immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the soule, yet of the state of soules after this present life, they litle determine, but leaue it so ragged, that a man can not tell what to make of it. But where the Philosopher saith for a conclusion <hi>fortis quanto est. &amp;c.</hi> his faithe was no better, but we by our faith know that the life to come, is much more excellent then this prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t life, full of misery and wretchednes, euer muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and vnconstant. Notwythstandyng for the naturall amitie betwixt the soule and the body, they be ful lothe to departe asundre, &amp; naturally <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> feareth such departure, therefore in the ouerco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And where the paines of death, or the fear of death many times ouerthroweth &amp; turneth the fraile minde of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of him selfe can not ouercome the perils of this world, &amp; come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reward of his labors,

Here the holie goste hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth mans minde, giuyng a certain boldnes and trust to come to rewarde euerlasting in heauen as to the most parfite ende of all good woorkes, and the very escape of all perils. To this end the true fortitude this gift of the holy gost, hath hys principall eye and respect. This excellent gifte of fortitude or manlynesse rested in our Sauiour Christ (as Esay speaketh) and made him to put away and shake of the passions of our fraile mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie, which made him to feare death, and to be pensyfull and heauye, when he sweat water and blood in his agonie, remembring the death that he should to. But anone he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered hys fathers pleasure, &amp; by fortitude went fourth to mete the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that were sent to take hym, and consequentlye suffred his painfull passion on the crosse, as he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> was determined for to doe. Wherefore God the father exalted him, and gaue him a name aboue all names, and that is had in reuerence of al cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures. Many we rede of in the olde testament and in the new, that boldlye contempned deathe for iustice sake, whyche had euer their principall respect and eye to reward euerlasting: As Esaye which wyth a sawe was deuided in two partes: Ieremye the Prophet was stoned to deathe for preaching to the people the word of God. And .ii.

When she with her .vii. sonnes were
<pb n="xxix" facs="tcp:12050:44"/>
conuented afore the kinge and the iudges, they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> were required to eate certaine meates that were prohibited and forbidden by the lawe, and to fal to the rites of gentilitie, which they refused con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantlye, and therfore were condemned to dye, &amp; were brought to execution: the eldeste sonne had first his tonge cut out of his heade, then the heere and skinne of his head striped of together, his fingers and toes cutte of, and when he was almost spent, yet he was cast into a great vessell like a friynge panne, and fire put vnder, &amp; there he was broyled and fryed vntill he was deade. His mother &amp; his brothers lokynge on him, and one comfortynge another manfullye to dye in Gods quarell, and for the kepynge of his lawes saiynge: <hi>Deus aspiciet veritatem &amp; consolabitur in nobis.</hi> God will loke vppon the truthe, and will haue comforte among vs. The second was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise serued, sauinge that his tonge was not cut <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> out, and at his laste ende saide to the kynge. <hi>Tu quidem scelestissime. &amp;c.</hi> O thou moste mische<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous manne, thou destroyest vs in this presente life, but the king of all the worlde will raise vs vp againe in the resurrection of life euerlastyng, that dyeth for his lawes. The thirde shewed furth his handes and his tonge, and said I haue the possession and vse of these thinges from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen aboue, but now I despise them for the lawe of God, because I hope and trust to receiue them of him againe. And euen so all the brothers were arayed, vntil they came to the seuenth. And that marueilous mother comforted them euerye one,

saiynge: I can not tell howe you did appeare <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> within my bodye, for I gaue you not spirite and lyfe, and I did not ioyne together the limmes of euerye one of you, but the creatoure and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the worlde, that fourmed and fashioned mannes natiuitie, and that founde the originall beginnynge of all thinges, wyll restore vnto you agayne with hys mercy both spirite &amp; lyfe, euen as you now despyse your selues for hys lawes sake. Antiochus the kinge thinkinge him selfe to be dispised and set at nought, counsayled the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that she shold entreate &amp; geue good counsail to the youngest sonne, and to saue his life if it might be. And she stowped downe to him moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge Anthiochus the Kinge, and saide: My sonne, haue mercie on me that bare thee nyne monethes within my bodie, and gaue thee milke of my brestes three yeres space, and mirced thee, and brought thee vnto the age that thou arte of, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> I desire of thee (my sonne) that thou do loke on heauen and earthe, and all thinges that be in them, and do vnderstande that God made them all of nought, and so it maye come to passe that thou shalt not fear this butcherly hangman, but shalte be made worthy to haue such brothers as be gone afore thee.

But who be meete and able to take it in hande, there is the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> doubte. I shall declare this doubte by an other like. The Philosopher. <hi>i.

They be so headstrong, and so obstinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> set to satisfie their concupiscence, and to take their pleasure, that they will not learne any les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for the contrarye. And so they can not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the ende of morall philosophie which is vertuous workes. Women also a frayle kinde, verye obedient to their fansies, and to earnestly and eagerly folowynge their lustes, be verye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mete scholers of morall philosophye. Nowe to my purpose, the ende of Diuinitie is good do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge as appeareth plainelye by Moyses and the Prophetes in the olde Testament, by our saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christe in the Gospels, and by the Apostles in their Epistles in manye places. And therfore diuinitie is not called a speculatiue science, but a science of practise or doinge. Then as the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher reasoneth of the hearers of philosophye I maie saie likewise, that children whether they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> be children in yeres, or childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dicions &amp; vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous maners for their wilful pronitie &amp; headines to satisfie their lustes &amp; pleasures, whether they be menne or women, can not perceiue the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, and diuersitie of such good works as be taught in diuinitye nother y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things that be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in diuinitie, their passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s doth so sequester and alienate their wittes from consideracion of them, that they shall be little or nothing the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for hearing of theim, if they come where they maye heare of them, as at sermons, lessons, and exhortacions, to which they come verie seldome, they loue nothinge worse, and thinke no tyme

worse spent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time while thei be hearing the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> word of god, ful like the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that our sauiour Christ speaketh of <hi>Mat. xiii.</hi> reciting y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> propheci of Esai: <hi>Auribus grauiter audierunt,</hi> It greued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to heare the woorde of God, <hi>et oculos suos clauserunt,</hi> they shut fast their eyes. <hi>Nequa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do oculis videant.</hi> Lest they might se with their eyes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> works of Christ, &amp; the right way to heauen.

For in al such maner of sayinges you muste vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the impossibilitie, yea rather the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to do wel, is of our self onely, &amp; not of god. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Therfore s.

She must consider her creation, that a woman
<pb facs="tcp:12050:50"/>
was last made, and first in faulte and in sinne. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Wherfore it besemeth women to knowe their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dicion &amp; to be subiect, and not to refourme and teache menne. Once she taught and marred all, therfore Paule woulde haue her teache no more. But here you must vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d as wel for the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers minde of the hearers of moral philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, as for. s. Pauls minde of the students in holy scriptures, that although nether children in age, neither in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dicions, all geuen to take their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and to folowe their lustes, be appropriate and most conuenient hearers of philosophye, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they lacke experience of vertuous workes and by childishe plaiyng the boyes, and plaiynge the wantons be customed in lewdenes, yet thys notwithstandyng if they be vnder awe and feare of their parentes or of maisters, or of officers, they maye take profite by hearynge Philosophy, in as much as if they be straightly holde to such <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> learning, they may be disposed to vertue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint from vice by the same. And muche like it is of the studie of scriptures, if such voluptuous persons be compelled to haunt sermons, lessons, and exhortations, by suche meanes the folishnes and ignorance that is knitte in the hearte of the wanton and childishe persone maye be driuen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the rodde of discipline. And I reade of many blessed women that haue bene vertuously brought vp in youth, and well exercised in holye scriptures, as they that saint Hierome wrote to, and many others whiche we worshyp for blessed saintes in heauen, to whiche God gaue grace to
<pb n="xxxv" facs="tcp:12050:50"/>
subdue their affections and lustes, and by that they were the more mete to receiue the gifte of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> science and cunnyng by the scriptures. But I rede not that they were readers, preachers, or disputers of scriptures. Manye wise questions they vsed to aske and were without countresai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng satisfied with such answers as were giuen them by them that were learned. I doubt not but they vsed to teache their maydes at home such lessons as might make them chaste and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout. For women may be exercised in teaching after that maner, as appeareth by Saint Paul <hi>Tit. ii.</hi> saying that aged wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> among other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, must be, <hi>bene docentes, vt ad castitatem eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diant adolescentulas,</hi> well teaching, that they may enforme their yonge women to chastitie, and to loue their husbands, and to loue their children,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to be cleane in countenaunce, in woordes, and in bodie, to be good huswiues <hi>benignas et subditas viris suis,</hi> boner &amp; boughsome to their husbands. So farre blessed Saint Paule giueth women libertie to teache, but not to teache men. All beit saint Ierome in the preamble of his expositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the psalme: <hi>Eructauit cor meu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> verbu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bonu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> wysedome in her so doing, came of the wytte of Ioab, that sent her to the kynge to intreate for Absalon that he myghte be restored agayne into hys countrey. The blessed manne <hi>Aquila</hi> and hys wyfe <hi>Pryscilla</hi> when they hadde hearde A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo preache Christe, they called him asyde and better taughte hym in the faythe of Christe in some pointes then he was taught afore <hi>Act. xviii</hi> But here the scripture expresseth not whether the man Aquila, or the wyfe Priscilla taughte Apollo. And it maye well be that they bothe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed hym. For the holye spirite of God brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theth and inspireth his giftes where it pleaseth hym, and by theym that it pleaseth hym, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be men or women. Therefore it maye so be that it pleased GOD to illuminate the sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of women, and by theym for the tyme to teache menne. Sometyme for the reproch and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> confusion of menne to make theym ashamed of their dulnesse and sleweth.

because it is rare and syldome, but of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> a common course it becommeth women to be subiecte and to learne in sylence, and if they will teache, then to doe it wyth modestye and secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, and not openlye to dyspute and teache men, and that is Saynte Paules mynde as I sayde afore. Scripture is in worsse case then anye other facultye, for where other faculties take vppon theym no more then pertayneth to theyr owne science, as the Phisicion treateth of thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges partaynynge to the healthe of mans bodye, and the Carpenter or the Smith medleth with theyr owne tooles and woorkemanshyppe. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la scripturarum ars est quam sibi omnes passim ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicant, hanc garrula anus, hanc delirus senex, hanc sophista verbosus, hanc vniuersi presumunt lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant docent antequam discant,</hi> as Saynte Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome saythe in hys epistle <hi>ad Paulinum.</hi>

Of all suche greene Diuines as I haue spoken of it appeareth full wel what learnynge they haue, by thys, that when they teache anye of their Disciples, and when they gyue anye of theyr bookes to other menne to reade the fyrste sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion why he shoulde laboure suche bookes, is

Of such speaketh the prophet. <hi>Psa. liiii.

They would haue that this latine worde <hi>Imago</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth an Idole, and so these new translations of the english bibles hath it in all places, where the translatours would bring men to beleue that to set vp Images, or to haue Images is idolatrye.

And so speaketh our Sauiour Christ of an Image, when the Pharisies send their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples wyth Herodes seruauntes, to aske hym thys question: whether it were lawfull for the Iewes to paye tribute to the Emperour or not?

He asked them: <hi>Cuius est Imago hec et superscriptio Mat. xxii.</hi> Whose is this Image &amp; the scripture about? They answered: the empo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.

For Saynte Paule sayth. <hi>i. Cor. viii. Scimus quia nihil est Idolu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in mundo, &amp; quod nullus est deus nisi vnus.</hi> We knowe that an ydole is nothinge in the worlde, and that there is no God but one. Where the blessed Apostle referreth muche vnto science in this matter of ydoles, and of meat offered vnto them, and spoke to them that were learned, and shoulde haue conning to discerne in this mater: sayinge in the beginninge of that. viii.

An ymage is a similitude of a naturall thinge, that hath be, is, or may be. An ydole is a similitude representing a thing that neuer was nor maye be. Therefore the ymage of the cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixe is no ydole, for it representeth and signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Christ crucified, as he was in dede. And the Image of Saint Paule with the sworde in his hande, as the signe of his martirdome is no I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dole, for the thinge signified by it, was a thinge in dede, for he was beheaded with a sworde in dede: but an Idole is an ymage that signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a monster that is not possible to be, as to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie

After this maner good frendes, you must by sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and connyng, learnedly speake of Images and Idoles, and not to confounde the wordes, or the thinges signified by them, takyng one for an other.

our Lord and master, and to do him worshyppe,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> honour and reuerence as to our father. Thus he hath bounde vs to hym by the faythe that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused and poured into vs at oure christenynge and wee haue bounde our selfe to hym by our promysse that wee there professed, for hys sake to renounce, refuse, and forsake the deuyll, and all hys pompe, and proude workes, and so all wee were there made religious persones, appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and appoynted chiefelye to thys seruyce that I nowe speake of, <hi>pietas,</hi> that is to saie: the true worshippynge of GOD, or the inwarde habite, qualitie or gifte of the soule, by the holye Goste geuen to man or woman, by whiche a manne or a woman hauing it, is inclined to goodnesse, and made well disposed, well minded, prompte and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ready to serue GOD, and to do hym worshippe. But because it is playne by the Prophet Esay, (where my matter is grounded) that all these gyftes rested in the manhode of our Sauioure Christe, whom he called the flower that shoulde rise vp out of the rodde, springynge forthe from the roote of Iesse. Let vs searche the scriptures whether it do appere by his actes that he hadde this gift. <hi>Luke ii.</hi> when he was twelue yere olde and able to take some labours, he wente wyth his mother and wyth his foster father to Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem. They casting no perylles, wente home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde after the solemnitie of the feast, thinking that Christe hadde been in the companye of the neighbours that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> went together homwarde fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Hierusalem after the maner as Pylgrymes,
<pb facs="tcp:12050:62"/>
vsed to go in flockes togither. Thus they passed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the way a whole daies iourney afore thei missed him, when thei missed him it was no nede to bid the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> seke, they had lost their greatest iewel. They sought him among their frends &amp; acquaintance and coulde not finde him, the nexte daye they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned backe to Hierusalem, the thirde day they sought all aboute in the Citye, the fourth daye, that is <hi>post tridium,</hi> after thre dayes they found him in the temple sittynge among the doctours, hearynge them, and askynge questions of them. He first hearde them reade and teache, and then asked questions, and opposed them. Woulde GOD our Bible clerkes woulde so do nowe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies, that they woulde firste heare and learne, and afterward to oppose, for so they should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite them selues, and theim that they do oppose. Where nowe when they do oppose, it is wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anye learned maner, and more for a vayne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> glorie, or for to publishe and open mennes igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunces, rather then to instruct them, and that appeareth, for commonlye they be doinge &amp; most busie with theim that be vnlearned, rather then with them that be learned. Our sauiour Christe occupied not him selfe soe, but gate him selfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge the verye beste of the doctours that were in the Temple, firste geuinge good aduertens and audience to their saiynges, and then oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>synge them for their learnynge. And after thys maner his Parentes founde him occupied, hys mother saide vnto hym: Sonne, why haue you serued vs so? your father and I with sorowe
<pb n="xlvii" facs="tcp:12050:62"/>
and care haue sought you. And Christe said vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, why sought you me? Know ye not that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> I muste nedes be in those thinges that be my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? Or aboute my fathers busines? Where he called the resorting and commyng to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and there to be occupied in contemplation, in preachinge, readynge, teachinge, disputynge, or reasonyng, his fathers matters, his fathers bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse. And in this he declared this gift of <hi>pietie,</hi> (that I nowe speake of) to be in him, and that by this gifte, he was inclined so to do, and so to occupy him selfe in the seruice of his father, and in the worshippyng of almighty God. And after when .s. Iohn Baptiste was cast in prison, then came our sauiour Christe abroade, and preached his holye doctrine in Galilee and other places. <hi>Luke. iiii.</hi> and in his progresse he came to Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> where he was nourced and brought vp in his childhode. And there came into the churche on the Sabboth daie as he was wont to do, and stode vp and redde a porcion of the scripture as the maner was. The scripture was of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecye of Esay. <hi>ca. lxi. Spiritus domini super me propter quod vnxit me, eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gelizare pauperibus mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit me. &amp;c.</hi> After he had redde it, he clasped vp the booke, &amp; deliuered it to the clerke or minister that hadde the kepyng of it, and sate downe like a doctour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or a reader in his chaire, or on his stole and expounded and declared the same scripture, appliyng it to him selfe as the true litterall sence of that scripture did pretende, saiynge: <hi>Hodie impleta est hec scriptura in oculis vestris.</hi> Now this
<pb facs="tcp:12050:63"/>
scripture is fulfilled afore your eyes. The holye <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> spirite of God was on him, and did annointe him and sende him to preach to the poore people, that be poore in spirite, and lowlye in herte. All this was the seruice of his father, redoundyng to his worshippe, and to his fathers honour he applied all his preachinge. <hi>Ioh. xiiii.</hi> The sermon that you haue hearde, is not mine, but it is my fathers that sende me. Also, <hi>Ioh. xv.</hi> In this my father is glorified, that you maye bringe furthe muche fruite, and may be made my scholers. He did not attribute or geue it to his owne glorye or prayse that his disciples increased in knowledge, and in the fruite of good works comming of the same, but to the glorye and prayse of his father. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise that his disciples and we by them be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes disciples, he willeth vs to geue laudes and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> glorie therfore to the father, although y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fathers glorie and his by reason of his Godheade, were &amp; is all one. Thus ye may well perceiue through the Gospels, howe vehemently and earnestly he was geuen to the true seruice and honour of god seking the glory of God, and not his owne glory or the glory of his manhode. <hi>Ego non quero glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam meam est qui querat &amp; iudicet. Ioh. viii.</hi> which is the verye exercise and practise of this sixt gift of the holy gost called in latine <hi>pietas</hi> in englyshe the <hi>worshipping of God,</hi> or <hi>the gifte of grace by whiche we be prompte and ready, and glad to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe God.</hi> And when we be so disposed, taking example at our Sauiour Christe, commynge to his holye Temple or churche dedicate to Gods

honour, where his holy word is redde and song,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> expounded, preached, and declared, and there oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupie our selfes in contemplation and prayer like good christian people, it is a great signe that we be partakers of his plenty, hauynge this gifte of the holy goost deriued vnto vs by our Sauioure Christe. And this (I thinke) is one proper signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of <hi>pietas,</hi> and is as saint Ambrose. <hi>i offi. xxvii.</hi> sayth, the firste and principall parte of our iustice, and the beginnynge of wisdome, to know of whom we haue our wit and al other goodnes and to do him seruice accordynge to his benefite. Albeit if we should extend and enlarge the name of <hi>pietas,</hi> of reuerende worshippe, we shall finde that wee owe seruice or reuerende worshippe to our countrey, &amp; also to our parents that brought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> vs into this world, and nursed vs, cherished vs, and helped vs when we could not helpe our self, and also to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that be nye of kinred to vs. So that this vocable <hi>pietas,</hi> semeth now to haue .iii. significations, to whiche he agreeth, <hi>secundum analogiam quandam,</hi> as the Logition speaketh. After a certaine order likewise, as there is an order betwixt the thynges signified, we owe a reuerende seruyce and worshippe to almyghty GOD, as to our maker, mainteyner, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demer, as I haue sayde. Wee owe also a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerende seruice and worshippe to our countrey. Wee also owe a reuerende honoure and worship to oure fathers and mothers, &amp; to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that be to vs nexte of kinred. But we be not so bounde to serue our countrey as wee be to serue God, nor
<pb facs="tcp:12050:64"/>
so straightly bound to our pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes &amp; kinred as to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> our cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey. If the whole countrey or the whole realme in whiche thou were borne, would moue thee to do that facte, or that thinge that shuld be contrarye to Gods pleasure, and contrary to his holy scriptures, forsake thy countrey, esteme it not, take no parte with them, but cleaue faste to Gods holye worde, and resiste euen to death, the malice and frowardenesse of suche miscreantes as would moue thee to the contrarie. Did not the Apostles so? Were they not al Iewes borne? was not all the whole countrey bended to extinct the remembraunce of Christe? Howe oft were they commaunded they shoulde not once Preache or speake of his name vnder paine of stripes? yea, vnder paine of deathe? But all this would not serue, all this could not disseuer them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ, nor from publishyng of his fayth, and of his holy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> name, nother trouble, nor perplexitie, or distres, nor honger, nor nakednesse, nor peryll, nor perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, nor sworde, axe, or anye weapon. <hi>Ro. viii.</hi> Seconde, we be more bounde to our countrey then to our parentes or kynred, in so muche that if there woulde anye foreine Potentate, or alien power, attempte to inuade the Realme where thou art inhabitant, &amp; of the nacion, yea: though thine owne father, vncle, brother, &amp; all thy kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that thou hast were on that partye, so irrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into thy cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try, thou oughtest to forsake the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al, &amp; to fight against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al for the defence &amp; saue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of thi cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey, yea &amp; (that goeth nere to the then so) to forsake thy selfe and thine owne lyfe
<pb n="xlix" facs="tcp:12050:64"/>
and healthe, and to put thy selfe in ieopardy for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> thy countrey sake. The paynim capitayns did so, the holy men that scriptures doth commende and repute theim <hi>in Catalago sanctorum,</hi> in the rolle and number of saintes did so likewise. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drus</hi> king of Athens in a battaile against the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loponensis, perceiued by an aunswere that the deuill had made speakinge in an ydole to the said Peloponensis, that they shoulde haue the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye, if thei killed not the capitaine of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry parte: Wherfore the whole hoste was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to saue <hi>Codrus</hi> the kinge of the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nensis in anye case. This was not so secretelye done, but it came to <hi>Codrus</hi> eare, which for the pietie and loue that he hadde to his countrey, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sgised him self like a poore labourer with his sith on his backe, and so came amonge the host of his enemies, and what with shrowde wordes and misbehauiour, and with his sithe he displeased <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the souldiours, and hurte one of them with hys sithe, whiche turned to him, and with his speare staffe killed him. When this was knowen, the Peloponensis fled, and so the Athenensis had the victorie, without anye more bloudsheading. In a certaine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersie betwixt the Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nensis, &amp; the people of Cyrene, a certayne citie in Libia, (of which it is touched. <hi>Act. ii. Et partes Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie que est circa Cyrenem,</hi>) it lieth eastward from Carthage, now I trow called Tuneis toward Egypt, bothe in Affricke. In a contrauersie (I saye) betwixte those two parties for the meyres or boundes of their territoryes and dominions,
<pb facs="tcp:12050:65"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued long to the great murther &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the people of both parties. At the last it was agreed betwixt bothe, that at a certaine time appointed betwixt both y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cities there shold certayne curriers be send furth, &amp; where so euer they met, there to be meyre stones pitched, &amp; such markes made whereby it myght be knowen for euer howe farre bothe lordshippes dyd extende, they that were sente out of Carthage were twoo brothers <hi>Phileni</hi> called, but so it was that these brothers were come a great waye further then the other partye thought they should. And so the Cyrenensis pretended some fraude to be in the setting forth of these me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But they for theyr cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys sake, and for the auoydaunce of further trouble of the same, for to assure the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye partie that the thing was done without col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> offred them selfe there to be buryed quick, that theyr tombes or graues might be the verye meires in this purpose, with whyche the other partie thinking no man woulde make suche an offer for the defence of a false matter was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and so ceased that controuersie. In holye scriptures we haue examples abundaunt, how that neither father nor mother, wyues neyther mens own naturall children coulde withdrawe men from the loue of their countreys, in so much that when some of theim were banisshed and driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of theyr cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey, yet whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei herd that theyr countrey was in daunger &amp; distresse, they sticked not to forget al displeasures and vnkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, &amp; to do the best they could to saue their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

In the same boke <hi>Aulus Gel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> saith, he red that the sayde Stoikes minde was that the thinges that mannes minde seeth,

which they cal fantasies that be not in mans po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> whither they come to mans minde or not, and when or what time they fall into ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s minde in as muche as they come of terrible and frayle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thynges, that it can not be chosen but they wyll moue the minde, yea of a very wise man, so that he shall for a while be afrayde or shrinke for sorow or feare as though these passions did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent the office of the mynde and of reason. And for all that, the minde to haue no opinion of hurt or yll, nor to approue or to conse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to these passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s or troubles of the mynde. And the saide Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers saithe that this is the difference betwixt the minde of a wise ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the minde of a foole, that the minde of a foole shrinketh and gyueth place to suche passions and applieth the assent of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> his minde to the same. But the minde of a wyse man although he can not chuse but must needes suffer suche sodayne passions, yet he dothe kepe a true and stedfast iudgement of suche thinges as he ought reasonablye to desyre or to exchue and auoyde without anye shakyng or wauering in hys minde. Whyche thinges if they be thus as that Philosopher <hi>Epictetus</hi> writeth, there is ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther no dyfference, or almoste no dyfference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the opinion of the said Stoikes, and of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Philosophers about these passions, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations of mens minde, for both sectes defen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth the mynde and reason of a wise man from the dominion and rule of them, &amp; therfore parad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture they saye that they fall not into the minde of a wise Stoike philosopher because thei

And the Philosopher that was in the ship (whiche I nowe spoke of) myghte suffer the sayde trouble of his phantasie and yet kepe thys fast sentence in hys mynde, that the lyfe and the healthe of his bodye, which he was like to loose by the rage of the tempest were not suche goodes or good thinges as maketh the hauers good men, as iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and vertues dothe. Bothe opinions saythe, that they had leuer loose those things, by which the body is kepte safe and sound: then to offende and do those thinges by which iustice is violate and defowled. Therefore the mynde of man, in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> which this said sentence is fast printed, doth not suffer any perturbations or passions to preuaile agaynste reason, althoughe they chaunce to the lower parties of the soule of man, but rather ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them and maystreth them, not consenting to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but rather resisting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, exercising the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, kingdome &amp; rule of vertue.

This is a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and carnall feare, and very nought and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and suche was the feare that the Scribes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and Phariseis had, sayinge. <hi>Si dimittimus eum sic. &amp;c.</hi> If we let him scape thus, then all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple wyll beleue vpon him, and then the Romains wyll come and take our place, and our people in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to captiuitie.

This carnall and worldly feare, yf it be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> with deliberation &amp; aduisement, is very nought and dampnable, where as yf it come of the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie and weakenes of the fleshe whiche natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallye abhorreth death, and abhorreth tortures, imprisonmentes, seruitude, bondage, and lacke of libertie and of accustomed pleasures, then yf this feare be but sodayne, though it trouble thy affection, wyll or appetite verye sore, there is no peryll in it, it is natural, it can not be well auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, specially the fyrst motions of this feare. And for the comfort of infirme and weake persones, least any man or woman susteyninge suche feare shoulde dispayre of saluation, oure Sauioure Christ to declare that he was a very man, &amp; that this carnall feare of the flesh is not euer damp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, but naturally ensuing and folowinge the infirmitie of the fleshe, did vouchesafe to susteine suche feare in his owne affection or wyll, when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> afore his passion he begonne to be afrayde, and to be wery, <hi>Marc. xiiii.</hi> he begonne to be afrayd of the death that he should to, and to be wery of the trouble that the Iewes put him to, and that he knewe they woulde put him to more greuouslye afterward, and this feare vexed him so sore, that for very agony and payne, his swete of his body was like bloude trikeling downe to the ground.

               </gap>tuperable and dampnable. Seruyle feare hath the next place, whiche some wryters doth vtterly dampne and say it is very noughte, but it can not be so: for ye knowe by experience that a mayster hadde leuer haue a prentyce or a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> seruaunte that woulde do his worke for feare of strokes, or for feare of beatynge, then to haue suche a prentyce that wyll nother do his worke for beatynge, nor for feare of displeasinge of his mayster, nether yet for loue. Of the fyrste maye come some good at length, but the other is des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, and of him commeth noughte but angre and vexation of minde to his maister, he must be put oute of seruyce and caste of.

<pb facs="tcp:12050:82"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> betynge. So (sayth S. Augustine) seruyle feare of God is when a man withdraweth and kepeth him selfe frome sinne for feare of the paines of hel, and for feare least he shalbe damned with the deuyls in hell for euermore. Although this feare be insufficient for mans saluation, yet it is verye good and profitable, for by this groweth a vse and a custome of iustice, or of well doynge: for he that oft tymes doth wel although it be for feare, shall fynde ease thereby, and at length shal haue a pleasure in well doynge, and a loue to iustice or well doynge, thoughe it were hard and paynfull for hym at the beginninge, and so the seruilitie, the bondage of the feare beginneth a litell and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> a litell to swage, and to be excluded, and it wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and beginneth to be amicable &amp; louing feare, by whiche a man doth well partlye for loue, and partely for feare. And this the doctours call <hi>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor initialis,</hi> and it is the meane and next way to the filial feare, the chast and holye feare that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth here, and shall remayne and continue in heauen for euermore, as the prophete sayth. <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor domini sanctus permanet in seculum seculi. Psalm. xviii.</hi> The holy feare of God abydeth for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore, it commeth of charitie whiche neuer fayleth. The foresayde seruyle feare of Goddes iustice and of his punyshment of synners, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a waye to the filial and charitable feare, but when charitie and louinge feare is once gotten, the former feare of punyshment vanysheth and goeth awaye, for the more that the loue is, the lesse is the feare of punyshment. The good that a
<pb n="lxvii" facs="tcp:12050:82"/>
man doth for loue, hath no spyce of the bondage <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> or of seruyle feare: therefore sayth Saint Iohn. <hi>i. Ioh. iiii.

                  </gap>, qui autem timet non est perfectus in charitate.</hi> In charitie there is no feare, but perfyt charitie dryueth out feare, for feare hath payne annexte, and he that feareth is not perfyt in charitie. Nowe these wordes of S. Iohn semeth contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the wordes of the Prophete, <hi>Timor domini sanctus. &amp;c.</hi> The holye feare of God abydeth for euer. To this I aunswere fyrst bringing in this example, that lyke as one blaste of winde of the belowes bloweth and fylleth two organ pipes or moo, so may one breath or inspiration of the holy spyryte fyl two heartes, and styrre two tongues,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the two organ pipes so blowen by one breath, concordeth and agreeth full well, so maye two heartes inspired with one holye spirite concorde and agre, as ye shall perceaue so that ye wil geue diligent audience. The Prophete in his sayinge addeth this worde <hi>Sanctus</hi> or <hi>castus,</hi> he calleth it holye feare or chast feare, the Euangelist Saynt Iohn doth not adde these wordes, therefore let vs put difference betwixt two feares, and so shal we vnderstand the consonaunce and concorde of these two organ pipes, the holye Prophete, and the blessed Euangeliste. There be men that fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth hell paynes, least they burne there with the deuils, this feare bringeth in charitie, but when he hath broughte in charitie, this feare auoydeth and charitie remaineth. If a man feare onely for
<pb facs="tcp:12050:83"/>
punyshment, then a man loueth not him that he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> so feareth, he desireth not that is good, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chueth that that is yll. Notwithstandinge, in as muche as a man is ware and feareth that that is yll, he correcteth and amendeth him self, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to desire that is good, that so there may be in him holy loue and chast loue, holy feare and chast feare. A man can not better declare &amp; make playne these two feares, then if a man put exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of two wiues, one aduoutresse, and disposed to take others beside her husbande, but she is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayde of her husbande least he punyshe her and cast her of. The feare that she hath of her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d is onely because she loueth her wicked purpose, and feareth leaste her husbande spye her with a faute, more then for any loue she hath vnto hym. The other wife (in my case) is a chast wife, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge no nother but to liue in coniugall chastite, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> accordinge to the lawe of matrimonye with her owne husbande, and to refuse all other for his sake, and for the loue of him. Both of these wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues feare theyr husbandes, but not after one ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: the fyrst feareth leaste her husband come and take her with the faute, the other feareth leaste her husband wil be gone, or will be longe awaye from her, and absent him self from her sight, and out of her company. The feare that the first wife hath of her husband, is like the bondmans feare, or the lewde seruauntes feare, &amp; this hath muche perturbation &amp; trouble of minde, and payne an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, whiche standeth not with charitie, as S. Iohn sayth in his epistle, for charitie expelleth
<pb n="lxviii" facs="tcp:12050:83"/>
suche feare of payne &amp; punishment. But because my sermon is not onely to maried men, &amp; to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> women, ye shal vnderstand that almyghtye God hath maried vs all to his onelye begotten sonne our sauiour Iesus Christ, by fayth. Saint Paule, the Euangelistes and preachers solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed this mariage, as S.

wepe and wayle, and woulde saye, I hadde leuer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> thou wouldest take awaye all these pleasures rehearsed, and let me see thy face. The chaste feare woulde crye out aloude with the prophete in the Psalme. <hi>O Lorde God of powers, conuert vs and shewe thy face, and wee shall be safe. One thinge I haue asked of our Lorde, and that I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire: that I maye dwell in the house of our Lorde, that I maye see the will of our God, and visite his holy temple.</hi> Nowe good frendes, if euerye one of vs will examine our owne Consciences after this maner as I haue nowe spoken, how many of vs shall we finde that hathe this chaste feare, this louing feare of the chaste wife, the holy feare that continueth for euermore? I pray God there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> be many suche amonge vs. They that haue not such feare, let theim begin at the least wise, wyth seruile feare that I spoke of, let them liue well for feare of the paynes of Hell, that so with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The true rule of our beliefe is the whole booke of holye scripture, but because it is to muche for euery parson to learne all that, and to beare it way, therefore the holye goste hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise instruct his holye churche to gather the most necessary thinges for Christen people to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue into .xii. articles, according to the nomber of the .xii.

And according to the nombre and names of the sayde Apostles I shall in my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse diuide the said articles.

            <p>THe first article saint Peter layde to thys collation and shotte or gatheringe, and it is this: <hi>I beleue in God the father almightie, maker of heauen and earth.</hi> In whiche article ye must note the order of the words. Fyrst it is said <hi>I beleue</hi> to declare that it is no point of our charge to discusse and reason the highe iudgement and secrets of God, nor to require and aske these bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sye questions, when, how, or why, but plainelye <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and stedfastly to leane to our fayth, beleuyng on one God. It is not sufficient to beleue that there is one God, for the deuils in hell beleue that, and so did the Paynym Philosophers, but they dyd not glorifie hym as God, but played the fooles in theyr fansies, as other idolatours did. It is not sufficient to beleue GOD as thou beleuest thy neighbour or thy brother, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou thinkest that hys saying is true, for so doth manye a synnefull person, and yet noughte wyll doe accordyng to Gods wordes, which he beleueth to be true. But we must beleue on God, or in God, that is to say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with our beliefe we must extende and set fourth our selues with loue to God so to be incorporate to him, and made one spirite with him, and thys
<pb n="lxxiiii" facs="tcp:12050:89"/>
is the good and parfit faith, adorned and decked <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> with charitie, which onely shall saue vs. And in case thou be in deadly synne &amp; out of charitye, yet ceasse not to say this thy belefe in this gathering or shotte of the Apostles, called the Crede, for it is the belefe of the vniuersal church, which doubt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>les is not without charitie, and so by the merite of the whole congregation of Christen people, thou as the vnfrutefull membre mayst labour to come to the beliefe of the whole, &amp; then trulye to say, that thou for thine own part beleuest in god, which afore was not true, but in the voyce of the whole church. If thou beleue on God, thou must beleue he is of infinite power, but one &amp; no more, for it is not possible twoo powers infinite to be. Then the superstitious erroures of Paygnyms worshipping creatures as theyr gods, as <hi>Iupiter, Mars, Venus,</hi> Sunne, Moone, or anye element, must nedes be false. And the heresie of <hi>Maniche</hi> making twoo first causes, or twoo Gods, one of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> good thinges which after him were onely things inuisible, and the other he put the causer and ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ker of all yll thinges. He called all visible crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures yll and nought, moued by a rude imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, because they may hurt or do yll, as the fyre burneth him that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to nigh vnto it, and is yll to hym, therefore he sayde it was yll by kinde, and made by the deuyll. And water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it choketh hym that is drowned in it, and so is yll to hym, therefore he sayd it was nought, by nature, and the effecte of the naughtye God. And all they that vse sorcery, charmes, wytche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craftes
<pb facs="tcp:12050:90"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> by inuocation and callynge on dampned spirites, that first taught men and women to vse such folishnes and to giue faith to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, loking for reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of secrets or for knowledge of thinges to come, or for healpe of the deuils, whych they ought to looke for onely of God. And generallye who soeuer obeyeth man more then God, doing that for the pleasure of hys Lorde or mayster, or for affection or carnall fauoure to hys worldlye frende or louer, which he would not do to please God, or doing for his louers sake that is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to Gods pleasure: Al such maketh their frendes theyr God, &amp; so do al they that labour to satisfie theyr carnall lust, or theyr bellies, more then to subdue them to Gods pleasure. All suche make theyr flesh or bellies theyr Gods, and do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue on one God, as is afore declared. It folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> in this first article, <hi>The father almightye,</hi> in which is expressed the first parson in trinitie, the original fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tain of the whole trinitie, by whose frutefull memorye the second parson in Godhed the sonne of God is gotten, aske not the maner how, for the angels cannot tel. The Prophetes were ignorant thereof: Esay saith: <hi>his generation who can declare</hi>? as who should say no creature. We muste beleue it, and reason no farther in it. Not that the father is elder then the sonne, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of greater power, but that like as the fyre is not without heate, neither the sunne in the fyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament without brightnes: so was the father neuer without the sonne, neither had any power to do any thing but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne had y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same power
<pb n="lxxv" facs="tcp:12050:90"/>
to do the same like him, and so hath the holy gost <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the third person in trinitie, product and brought forth by the will of the father, and of the sonne, coeternally with the father &amp; with the sonne. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightynes of power is here applyed to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the father by appropriation, although it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre to the almighty sonne, &amp; to the almighty holy gost, not three almighties, but one God almygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And by this that we beleue him to be almigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie, we haue a great comfort and lighte to beleue all the articles that folowe in our creede, for if he be almighty, he may make heauen and earthe of nought, he may make a man to be borne of a vir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gin, he may forgiue synnes, and giue life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting. <hi>Maker of heauen and earth,</hi> maker by creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is to say, without any matter or stuffe to make it of. That a man maketh, he maketh of somewhat, or of some stuffe, therefore he can be no creatour: but almighty god made heauen and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> earth of nothing, therefore he is iustly called the creator of heauen and earth. What is here to be vnderstande by thys woorde <hi>Heauen,</hi> there be two opinions, for which ye shall first vnderstand that heauen is called one maner of wise: the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piriall heauen aboue the starrye skye, and aboue all the orbes that moueth there, in which is ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place nor vacuitie, neyther time, but onelye thinges leading a most blessed life. Thys farre Aristotle dreamed and discussed <hi>primo de celo &amp; mundo,</hi> and it agreeth with holy scriptures, and with holy doctours, there putting the felicitye of Aungels and men that shall be saued in the fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition,
<pb facs="tcp:12050:91"/>
that is to say in the clere sighte and loue of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> God, ther most aboundantly shewing his glory. This the prophet in the psalme calleth the kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of GOD, saying to God of the same. <hi>Thy kingdome is the kingdome of all worldes,</hi> as who should say, whatsoeuer nomber of yeares can be thoughte or spoken of, thys kingdome passeth it, for this king almighty God was neuer wythout a kingdome, by which it semeth to be eternal and euerlasting, for it is the very clerenes of God, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eternal with him, and not created with other vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible creatures, and to thys were admitted and receiued the holy angels after their creation, for so long space and such durance as God knoweth best, afore that he made heauen and earthe that Moyses spoke of. And of this minde is Saynte Basile as appeareth in the first homilye of hys exameron. Heauen is taken an other waye, for the bodies aboue, as Sunne, Moone, Sterres, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> with the orbes and circles there. Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is called also the thirde maner, all that is aboue the earth and so the sayde bodies aboue, with the speires of the fyre and of the ayre be compriseed vnder one name of heauen, &amp; so it is taken in the psalme when we say, the birdes of the heauen, for the birdes of the ayre. And (after this opinion) so ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Moyses this word <hi>Heauen</hi> when he saythe that in the begynning God made heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; earth. And by the <hi>Earth</hi> there is to be vnderstande the water and earth together, whiche as then were not dysseuered and diuided tyll the thirde daye when the earth first appeared drye. The seconde

opinion which is more comon taketh this worde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 
               <hi>Heauen</hi> for the empiriall heauen replenished and fulfilled with the glorious companye of Angels, whiche was made together with the earthe, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandynge by the <hi>Earthe</hi> the firste vnfacioned matter or stuffe, of which almighty God made, disposed, and garnyshed al other kindes of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that may be sene, or feled as wel in the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament aboue, as vnder it, to his owne glorye &amp; to do seruice vnto man.

Christ is as much to saye as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted, and he was anoynted before all other men, by the chiefest oyntment which is the holye gost, one God with him and with his father, of which oyntment the anointyng with oyle is the sacrament and signe.

            <p>THe eyght article saint Mathew the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle and Euangelist sayd: <hi>From thence he shall come to iudge the quicke and the deade.</hi> In the same body he wyl come to the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, in whiche he ascended into heauen, to iudge all christen and hethen, for all we that be, hath be, &amp; shall be, shall stande afore Christes seat of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that euery man maye receaue the duetie of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> his bodye as he hath done, whether it be good or yll <hi>.ii.

            <p>THe nynth article of oure fayth, is of the thyrde personne in Trinitie, the holye Gooste, expressed by Saynte Iames the sonne of Alphey, called Iames the lesse, because he came later to be <hi>CHRISTES</hi> scholer, then the other Iames, the Sonne of <hi>Zebede,</hi> of whome I spoke in the thyrde Article.</p>

The holy Goost the thyrde person, is brought forth by the fruitefull will of the father, and of the sonne, as the equall wyll and loue of them both, of equall mighte and power and maiestie with the father and with the sonne, on whome we muste beleue. After the article of beleuinge on the holy Goost, conuenientlye foloweth two other articles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerninge the workes of grace of the holy Goost.

            <p>OF the fyrst grace Symon the Apostle, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Chananeus</hi> and <hi>Zelotes,</hi> putteth the tenth article of oure crede saying. <hi>The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly catholike Churche, the communion of sainctes.</hi> After the myndes of some holy doctors, we may not saye properlye that we beleue in the holye Churche, or on the holy Churche, for the Church is not God on whom we beleue, as is aforesayd, it is the house of God. Albeit if we say so, it may be allowed: as S.

<pb n="lxxxv" facs="tcp:12050:101"/>
because that by theyr fayth and charitie, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended theim selues to God and all good men.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> So in as much as we extende and set forth oure selues to conforme our selues to the vnitie of all holy churche, and to the communion and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of all holy folkes, by our fayth adourned with charitie, mouinge our selues to suche conformitie in perfection of life, we may by that reason saye that we beleue on the holye Churche, and on the communion of sainctes. This Churche is called holy, as for a distinction and difference from the Churche that the prophete speaketh of, saying: <hi>I hate the churche of imaginers of mischiefe, dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and debate.</hi> For suche Churches be not holy, but rather yll and very noughte. It is also called holy, because the people and company of the same be washed from the vncleanes of sinne by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacramentes of the church, takinge their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacitie and strength at the bloude of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Christ. It is called catholike, that is to say: vniuersall or whole ouer all the world, not mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teringe in sundry corners or countreys, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes haue imagined theyr Churches. There can be no greater treasure, no greater honour gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then to haue the grace of the lyuely fayth of this vniuersall churche. This fayth saueth sinners, worketh miracles, ministreth Sacramentes: who so euer he be, or in what state or condition so euer he be, yf he be not in this fayth of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholyke churche, he is no true christen man, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can be saued, lyke as there was no man nor woman saued aliue in the great floude that was

stedfastly to beleue this article, to take from vs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the feare of death: for if we thoughte there were no lyfe hereafter, we might well feare death as a thinge most horrible, whiche nowe we take as a necessary meane and highe waye to eternitie, and life euerlastinge.

For the first ye shall vnderstande, that this vocable or latyn worde <hi>Ceremonie</hi> (as <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> wryteth in the fyrst booke of his stories) hath his name of a towne in Italy called <hi>Cerete,</hi> into which towne (whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the citie of Rome was taken by the french<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) the preist of <hi>Quirinus,</hi> and the professed mai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dens called <hi>Vestales virgines</hi> with theyr Idolles, and other sacred thinges (after their maner) that they could conuey out of the citie, were caried in a wayne and there receiued, &amp; had in very greate veneration.

Uerely some speciall deuout fashions or behauiour that he vsed about the sacrifices or seruices of God as he had lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of his anceters, which I thinke verely were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> euen the same, or muche like to them that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde were expresly commaunded by God, and written by Moyses. Abel Adams sonne learned of his father to honoure God wyth the fruites that God sende him, and to make oblations to him of the same.

And of the cleane fowles from he vnclene, the burnynge vp of the whole carkasses, head, fete, bowels, and al except the skinne was ceremoniall. But afore that wee entreate of these ceremoniall lawes, I thinke it necessary somewhat to speake of morall lawes, and also of Iudiciall lawes, which knowen, the ceremonies may be more euident. The morall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> lawes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded by God be they that be of the iudgement of right reason or much consonant &amp; agreing to the same, &amp; that shal moue a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ful<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fil &amp; do the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, although there wer no law writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pell a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to fulfil the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as this.

all the worlde in that tyme, and as I feare <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> me, it is in manye of vs nowe, for malyce was neuer so abundaunte. For this purpose it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye necessarye that they shoulde be declared in the churches on sondayes and holy dayes to put men in remembraunce of their duetie to GOD, and to their neighbors, other morall rules there be, whyche bynde as monicions by the waye of honestie, as this. <hi>Afore a white heade thou shalte rise vp and do thy dutye.</hi> And this, <hi>Honod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And of the saide morall commaundementes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth bothe the Iudiciall preceptes, and the ceremoniall.

A morall lawe this is. <hi>Thou shalt not kyll auye man, woman, or childe.</hi> Then if a man breake this lawe by prepensed malyce, killynge a manne, the Iudiciall lawe sayeth the he shall dye for it, where as if he did it by chaunce medley, wythout anye suche intended mischiefe, he myghte saue hym selfe by some sanctuarye. <hi>Thou shalte honour thy father and mother,</hi> is a morall commaundemente.

Some were all burned, some were part burned, part rosted or sodde, and parte appointed for the priestes part, part for the owner that offred it to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> make merye with all. And they were common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of rudder beastes, of sheepe, or goates. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge birdes, of doues or turtles, and seldome of sparrowes, as in the purgation of Lepris, which (as S.

calleth them neady and pore principles, for they nother geue grace to the vsers, nother geueth to the ministers any spiritual power to remit sinne.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> The priest bi his order had power to kil the cow and to burne her, and to mingle the asshen with running water, &amp; to sprinkle it vpon the vnclene and so to purge him from an externall irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of his flesh, that so he might lawfully come into the courts of the tabernacle, &amp; sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d amongst honest me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, where as afore he ought not so to do.

            <p>¶The obseruances were certain religious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of liuinges that the people of Israell, and the holy fathers their progenitours as the electe and chosen people of GOD vsed, to shewe them selues distincte and differente from all Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of which the world was then full. In Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses time almighty God expressely commaunded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by Moyses and Aaron to obserue &amp; keepe a prescise maner in their diet. They should eat no fleshe of any four foted beastes, but onely of such as were both clouen foted, and did also ruminat his meat, or chew quyd. All other they should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute vnclene and not eat of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. They should no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eat porke, pigge, hare, nor conyes, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others. They were forbidden all fish that had not both finnes and skales, tench, eles, congres, loches, &amp; culles, with manye others were not for for them, of birdes, all raueners liuynge by prey, as haukes, grifes, kites, and all kinde of rauens, or crowes, and such like, and swanne flesh, with many others they were forbidden as things vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clene to be eaten &amp; to be touched. And they sholde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> not drinke nor occupie the water or other liquor that any such or any part of them had falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into, the vessell conteynynge such liquor, should be cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Albeit, brokes, welles, mayrs, pondes, and cesternes made to gather water, and to kepe them, mighte be occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied for drinke, and to dresse meat, although such filthy forbidden thinges had fallen into them. How they shold punysh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues with fastyng. In the feast of expiation or clensynge, &amp; many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther seasons, and how the wiues vowe to offer, or to fast, or to do any such like thing of deuotion should be approued by her husbande as sone as he knew of it, or els not to binde her. And in case he wold say co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary on the first day that he knew

Likewise to kepe holy day all the .vii.<hi rend="sup">th</hi> yere in deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; nother to plow nor to sow, nor to gather corne, &amp; so in the space of two yeres together, they had but small sustenaunce. ¶Nowe wee haue hearde howe these Lawes bounde the Iewes to obserue and keepe theim vnder the paynes expressed for transgressours of the same, it is necessarye to knowe howe they binde vs christen people in the tyme of grace ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited and geuen vs by oure Sauioure Iesus Christe.

The iudicialles of Moises law as giuen by him,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> hath this imperfection annexed, that they make a man to doe well for feare of punyshment more then for loue. And feare hath euer payn annexed, and therfore Moyses law was called the law of feare, and by that is a painefull law. It woulde abhorre a mans hart to heare how many tymes the payne of deathe is inculcated and repeted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the sayd iudiciall lawes specially, but they as giuen by Moyses bindeth not vs Christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, notwithstandinge because in manye pointes they be very ciuill and holsome rules to direct co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalties, or particuler persons, wher Christen princes and noble counsa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>les thynketh it good to take any of the saide iudiciall lawes of Moyses, and to stablishe theym, to order theyr subiectes, then the sayd subiectes be bounde to obserue and kepe them, not as giuen of Moyses, but as new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye made by their owne superiours and rulers. But as for the Iewes ceremonies, because they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> were the very figures and onelye significations of Christ to come, and of some sacraments &amp; cere<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>monies to be vsed in Christes church in the tyme of grace now alredy exhibited and performed, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs by our sauiour Christ. They must needes surceasse, for when the veritie of the sygnes and fygures be put in execution, the shadowes be of no efficacitie. It is mortal sinne now to vse them putting any trust of saluation in them, for in so doing we shoulde shewe oure selues to be of the Iewes faith, thinkinge that our redemption by Christ is not yet sufficiently performed, whych is
<pb facs="tcp:12050:110"/>
plaine false and dampnable to be beleued. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Christes churche is not clearelye without ceremonies, some ordeined by Christ, &amp; by his Apostles, and holy fathers, by the comon consent of noble princes and commonalties, for the adorning, aduauncing and settyng furthe of Christes religion. For we haue sacrifices, sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, sacred or halowed thinges and obserua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, proporcionably to the foure that (as I tolde you) were vsed in Moyses law, one most excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t sacrifice is the busy and dayly sacrifice and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the masse of the blessed bodye and bloude of our sauiour Christ, in the forme of breade and wine. This sacrifice we be taught and commaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded to vse by the eternall priest, after the order of Melchisedech, our sauiour Iesus Christ at hys last supper, sacrificing vnto his father bread and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> wyne, turned by the vertue of his holy and migh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty worde into hys owne bodye and bloude. And in this doyng most deuoutly is called to mans re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>membrance his blessed immolation on the crosse, and is presented vnto hys father for health and grace to theym that be a lyue, and for reast and quyetnes for all them that be departed in fayth. A contrite and a troubled hart for a mannes sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes the Prophet in the psalme calleth a sacrifice which almighty God will not despise. And in an other psalme God sayth by the same prophet, the sacrifice of laude and praysing shal do me honor, kyll the wantonesse of thy wyll, and the ranknes of thy fleshe in the loue of him, and so thou shalt set vpon Gods aulter, that is to say, on Christes
<pb n="lxxxxiiii" facs="tcp:12050:110"/>
crosse the most acceptable sacrifice vnto him, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> who so euer voweth and payeth to God all that he hath, all that he lyueth, all that he vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, (as the Apostles did) he offereth to God an holocaust, that is to saye an alburned sacrifice. For generally euery dede that we do, by whych we shewe our selues to cleaue and stickefast vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, referred to an heauenlye ende, maye be called a sacrifice.</p>
            <p>¶Sacramentes we haue also seuen in nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, taking their efficacitie and strengthe at oure sauiour Christ, and left in the church as holesom medicines against the manyfold infirmities and diseases of our soules<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> These be the very few and manifest sacraments, in which the mercy of god <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> woulde haue his churche free and at lybertie as saynt Austine writeth in his boke of the customs of the churche to Ianuarye. And yet all these be not necessary for euerye man that shall be saued. For euery man taketh not holye orders, neyther euery man contracteth matrimony, many a man is saued without confirmation, and also wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the blessed sacrament of the aulter, and with out extreme vnction that we cal Inoyling. Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme is necessary, and to theym that after bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme haue fallen to mortall sinne, penance must nedes be had. And this seemeth to be the hardest Sacrament or ceremonie that Christe lefte in hys Churche, specially for that part of it, that is confession, in whyche we reueale and vtter to a mortall manne the synnes that afore were pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uye and secrete betwyxte GOD and vs.
<pb facs="tcp:12050:111"/>
But to mitigate thys confusion or shame, wee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> must inwardly consider the losing of our synfull bondes, and by that to be set at libertie, oute of the deuils danger, &amp; this shall make vs not to be ashamed to tell the truth for our soules sake. Let vs with all consider that he to whom we be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, is most straitly bound to keepe our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayl vnder a more priuie seale, then we be our self bounde, and so we shall not neede to stycke nor shrinke to make a plaine confessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Sacred or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed thinges we haue very manye, as churches and Churchyardes, Chalice, Corporas, Cruets, Uestimentes, and other ornamentes of the mini<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sters, doynge seruice in Christes churche, besyde their daily rayment, shewing distinction of them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the laife which is a veri honest ceremony &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cessary to be vsed, albeit a great many of vs prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes litle regard it, going in our apparell lyke the lay men, by that declaring that we be ashamed of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> our order, and woulde be glad to pull our heade out of that yoke if we might. We haue also <hi>obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uances</hi> of holye dayes, as sondayes and other so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lempne feastes by course succedynge after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolucion of the yere. We obserue also certayn so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lempne times of fastinge, as the faste of Lent, &amp; the Embre daies, and in the reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes passion we punish our bodies with abstine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and fasting euery fridai. The deuout ceremonies on Palme sondayes in processions and on good fridaies about the laying of the crosse and sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into the sepulchre, gloriouslye arayed, be so necessary to succour the labilitie of mans remem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>brance,
<pb n="lxxxxv" facs="tcp:12050:111"/>
that if they wer not vsed once euery yere,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> it is to be feared that Christes passion wold sone be forgotten, the crucifixes erected in churches, &amp; crosses by the highe wayes were intended for the same purpose, although some pestiferous perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s haue ouerthrowne them and destroyed them, for the very contempt of Christes passion, more then to finde money vnder them, as they haue preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. We obserue as a necessary ceremoni likewise a sober silence in the church in time of preachyng the worde of God, and also while diuine seruice is a doyng, with manye suche other ceremonyes which were to long here to be rehersed.</p>
            <p>¶And finally to speake of the iudiciall lawes the Iewes were neuer yoked nor troubled wyth halfe so manye gyuen to them, as we be pressed withal, what with ecclesiastical lawes and other statutes and actes aboue nomber. So that (as Sainte Austine in the booke of the customes of the church saith) the condition of the Iewes see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> more tollerable and easye to be borne, then the case that Christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people be in. For the Iewes neuer knewe the tyme of lybertie, and yet they were not bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d but only to the burdens expressed in Gods lawes, and not to mens presumptions as we be, in somuche that if a Iewe well learned in Moyses law, and conuerted to Christes faith, woulde consider hys former bondage whyle he was of the Iewes secte, and woulde conferre it to this bondage that he must lyue in wyth Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten people, he would thincke Christes law much more vntollerable, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Moyses law was to him.
<pb facs="tcp:12050:112"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> For what with our iudiciall lawes and our cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monials, we haue more layd vpon our backs, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we can well awaye withall, and but verye fewe daies passeth ouer vs, but we breake a great ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny of them, and not without peryl to our soules. Then where is the swete promise of our sauiour Christ: <hi>Come vnto me all ye that labour and be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerburdened and I shall refreshe you, and make you beare lighter, for my yoke is sweete, and my burden but light.</hi> For this ye shall vnderstand, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the old law vnto the new law of Christe, we may consider Christes lawe one way, as giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christ, and so very true it is that Christes law is muche more easye then Moyses lawe. For the iudiciall lawes be none left vs by Christe, but he biddeth vs to leaue all plees and actions, in so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche that he wylleth vs not to requyre eye for eye, nor toothe for toothe as Moyses law wold, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> but rather if a man would afore a Iudge claime thy coate, thou shalt not sticke with him, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther giue him thy coate and thy cloke withal. On a time there came one to Christ that had a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in variance betwixte him and his brother, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the diuision of theyr enheritance or londes, and would haue had Christ to take the matter in hand and to call his brother, &amp; to bid him deuide their possessions, that either of them might know his own: But Christ would none therof, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to be their Iudge in that behalfe, sayinge: O man, who made me your Iudge or the deuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der betwixt you? I came not for that entent, I wil not medle in such matters nowe, &amp; therefore his good scholer S. Paule writeth to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s:
<pb n="lxxxxvi" facs="tcp:12050:112"/>
that it was a great fault amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g them that they had such iudiciall causes among them: why do not ye rather (sayth he) take wrong? why doe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ye not rather suffer to be begiled? And this we be bound to do, in case that by our extreme and gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die asking of our own, there may be like to aryse some greater inconuenience, or yl example to our neighbour, but in case by our sufferance, malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or couetous persons may take a courage or boldnes to persist in theyr yll doing. We be not bound so to refraine to aske our own, but rather with modestie and sober behauiour we mai afore a competent Iudge redresse the iniury done vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, &amp; to require our right by iudiciall lawes, as well ecclesiastical as temporal, to which they that be subiect to the same lawes, be bound to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, in asmuche as they be made by men, whom God hath constitute &amp; set in power and authoriti <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> or by his secret counsail permitted &amp; suffered to beare rule &amp; authoritie, &amp; to haue the ministratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; execution of the lawes.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> but also for discharge of mens co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sciences, so that they shoulde do nothing contrarie to the princes and rulers of the people, but that they should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise the workes of Iustice and goodnes, wyth tranquillitie and quietnes wythout tortures or compulsion. Then consideringe that for our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science sake we must obey the iust ordinaunces of our rulers, it is plaine that if we do contrary, we hurt our consciences with inobedience, neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and contempt, and so we sinne and deserue pain, whereof it foloweth that to obserue &amp; kepe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s traditions, constitutions, and lawes, made by our superiours, hauinge authoritie ouer vs, as well for obseruing and keping of the ceremonies &amp; other bound duties of the churche, as for other lawes temporall, godly deuised for the quietnes of the kinges subiectes spirituall and temporall, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> is necessarie for our soule health. And that to dis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>obey and contempne them, is pernitious and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relous, as Samuel said: Obedience is better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sacrifice, for disobedience, repugnaunce, and resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, is like the most detestable vice of sorcerye and idolatry. But whether we be bound vnder payne of deadly synne to kepe all the reasonable lawes and traditions made by men or not, it is doubtfull. For this ye shal vnderstand that some lawes bindeth men to do suche thinges as be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarye to obtayne the loue of GOD and of thy neighbour, as this: thou shalt worshyp one God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thou shalt do none adultery.

Gods holy day, thou shalt be confessed to a priest <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> with all such as be necessarily deriued of them, &amp; agreing to them, whether they be gyuen by God or by man, edifying charitie, and commaundinge to exchewe, and not to do the thing that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to charitie. Nowe because charitie is the life of the soule, without which the soule is dead, whosoeuer transgresseth and breaketh any suche lawes, whether they be made by God or man, kil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leth his owne soule, and sinneth deadly. So that charitye is the verye true myrrour or glasse, by which thou maist trie and discusse &amp; haue a great euidence, as well of thine owne dedes as of other mens dedes, whither they be godlye or diuelyshe, holy or sinnefull. Some positiue lawes there be that binde not so sore as these do, because the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation and breaking of them, maketh not direct<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly against the loue of God and of thy neyghbour. As the positiue lawes of fasting, the prescise ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing of the ordinal in saying diuine seruice, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> lawes of humanitie or curtesie. And thys: Thou shalt make no lesynges, with a great nomber of temporal lawes, which a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> transgressing, doth not euer synne deadly, except there be concurrent a contempt or dyspisinge of the authoritie of the law, which maye make the offence that els was but veniall to be mortall. As in theym that wee haue heard of, that for very frowardnes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite of superiour authoritie haue eaten fleshe in Lent, which after Easter woulde haue ben glad to haue eaten fishe, if they coulde haue gotten it. Penall lawes bindeth two maner of wayes, one
<pb facs="tcp:12050:114"/>
way because the maker of the lawes wold haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> them kept, and we be bounde to obey theym, not onelye for feare of payne, but also for our consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence sakes.

Fyrst we must considre who wrote this letter: Seconde, to whome he wrote it: Thyrde, frome whence he wrote it: Fourth, for what purpose and intente he wrote it. For the fyrst it appereth, that Saint Peter Christes Apostle writte it, whiche was fyrst called Simon, Christ turned his name, and where afore he was called Simon, Christ called him Peter. <hi>Ioh. i.</hi> Blessed S.

In this appeareth the excellent prerogatiue of this blessed Apostle S. Andrew, in as much as he was the fyrst taken to acquain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taunce with Christe of all the disciples, and also his aboundaunt charitie, in as muche as he dyd not kepe to him selfe the treasure that he hadde founde, but would not rest tyll he had made his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> brother Peter partaker of the same. As sone as he found his brother then called Simon, he said to him, we haue fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d <hi>Messias,</hi> whiche is as much to say in English as anointed.

And by this (nowe by the waye) is confounded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the ignoraunce and erroure of certayne summa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listes, takynge for one of theyr strongest reasons for the supremitie of the pope of Rome, this text spoken to Peter, <hi>Tu es Simon, tu vocaberis Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas,</hi> whiche they interpretate <hi>caput,</hi> a heade, as thoughe Christe sayde, thou shalte be called the head, concludynge of that, hym to be the heade of the Apostles, and consequently his successors the popes of Rome to be heade of all the churche of all countreys, whiche thoughe it be very true, yet this texte proueth not so muche: for in the texte it is sayde expresselye, <hi>Cephas quod inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretatur Petrus: Cephas</hi> by interpretation is as muche to saye as a <hi>stone,</hi> or <hi>of stone</hi> (yf it be an adiectiue.)

And morallye Simon the
<pb facs="tcp:12050:119"/>
sonne of Ionas was called Peter. Symon by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> interpretation is as muche to saye as obedient: Ionas a doue, moste gentle, hansome, and tame byrde: Obedience is the chylde of the doue, of gentlenes and curtesye, and that we be obedient to good counsel, to godly exhortations, or to our maysters, it commeth of a gentyll and curtyse hearte, for gentlenes gendreth obedience, &amp; they that be proude, stubborne and sturdy, wyll neuer be obedient: they that be obedient shal chaunge theyr name into the better, they shall be Peter, fyrme and faste in goodnes, by that they shall be incorporate to Christ, the fyrme and fast rocke &amp; foundation of all our goodnes, we shalbe called Christians or Christen men and women, and by that we shalbe the children of God, the frendes of God, and the body of God with Christe, and coperteiners of his enheritaunce, and kingdome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> with hym.

the good tydinges of remission of synnes by Christe, and of lyfe euerlastinge. But this name <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> is not appropriate to them onely, but it agreeth also to manye other, as well in the olde testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente as in the newe. Moyses was a blessed prophete, and he myghte also be called Apostle, because God sente him to do his message to Pha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rao kynge of Egypt. <hi>Exo. iii.</hi> where he excused his vnhablenes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> desyrynge God to prouide an other to be sente thether.

Saynt Iohn Baptist <hi>fuit homo missus a deo,</hi> was sente from God, and by that he was Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, he was also a prophete, and more then a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete.

Of the seconde manner be they that be sente of GOD by man, as by a meane betwyxte GOD and them, as Iosue was made the guyde and instructoure of the people of Israell by Goddes wyll, declared

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> by Moyses, whiche in Goddes behalfe put hym in aucthoritie. <hi>Nu, xxvii.</hi> And so I doubt not but S.

               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerte the people to Christes fayth, and so he dyd spedely, God assisting and helping forth his god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purpose. And lykewyse when the kynges ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, or the prelates vnder him, sende furth ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike preachers amonge the people, sincerelye to instructe them to vertue, it is to be supposed that they be Apostles sende of God by man. The thyrde maner is of them that by mans fauoure &amp; affection, more then for learninge or any good condition in them, be sent or set furth to take v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> them the office of preachinge. And yet they lowly consideringe theyr infyrmitie and inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and the highnes of the office, that they be put in, by prayer, and exercise of study may come to suche grace, that they maye worthely execute the Apostles office, that they toke vpon them. The fourth maner of Apostles, be neither sent by God nor good man, as pseudapostles, false prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of heresies, scismes, discention, and diuisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of whiche speaketh Paule <hi>.ii.

name as though God sent them, &amp; yet God sayth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> not as they saye, neither sent them to do his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rande. Suche was not blessed S. Peter, but he was sent by almighty God our Sauiour Iesus Christ, as he sayth here in this salutation or gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge. <hi>Iesus,</hi> is as much to say as a sauiour, and therefore in as muche as Christe by reason of his godhead, was euer a Sauiour of the worlde, he had that name from the beginning of the world, and also afore the world was made, because that he euer intended to saue the worlde, after that it shoulde perisshe. And for this cause the Aungell Gabriell, when he had Ioseph that he shoulde not put away Mary his wife, but cherysshe her, declaringe that the chylde that she went with al was begotten, not by anye misorderinge of her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> virginall bodye, but by the operation of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly goost, and that he shoulde call the chylde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, because he should saue the people from their synnes. The Aungell bad him not geue him that name, but bad him that he shoulde call him so, by the name that he had euer, for he was euer a Sauiour. Manye we reade of in the olde testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente that were called Iesus, as Iesus Naue, otherwise called Iosue, and Iesus <hi>filius Iosedech Eccl. xlix.</hi> and Iesus <hi>filius Syrach.

            <p>
               <hi>Christ,</hi> is as much to say as anoynted, &amp; so was oure sauiour Christe with the oyle of gladnes, that is to say: with the grace of the holye gooste, signified by the gentyll supplenes of oyle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

By <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that the Prophet compareth him to his felowes ye may playnely vnderstande, that he meaneth of the manheade of Christ, by whiche he become oure felowe, for the godheade is but one, &amp; hath no felowe in substaunce.

Therefore the prophet sayde full well <hi>pre consortibus tuis,</hi> aboue al other men, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che was perfitly declared, perfourmed, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fylled, when he was baptised in Iordan water, &amp; the holy gost descended lyke a doue, and lyght vpon him, and abode in him. <hi>Ioh. i.</hi> Now I must (according to my promise) declare, vnto whome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> S.

and by the wonderous miracles that they sawe wrought euerye daye by the power of Christes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> name, like as an infinite number of the Iewes were conuerted to Christes fayth, anone after the commyng of the holy Gost vpon the apostles by whose grace and comfort they preached bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and Christe euer wrought with them, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynge their preachynge with signes and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, aboue mannes power to do.

And afterwarde hearde that the sayde <hi>Simon magus</hi> was come to Rome, and had there diuine honours done to hym as to a GOD, and had Images erected in his honour, and that he made all the Citye to dote vpon hym like madde me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for this occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he came to Rome as <hi>Eusebius</hi> saieth. <hi>Li. ii. ecclesiastice historie. ca. xiiii.</hi> and there within a while quenched the blindnes of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and of that deuillysh womanne that he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> had in his companye, by whose disceitfull force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye he allured manye to geue credence to hym. And that Saint Peter beinge at Rome, wrote this Epistle, and sent it from Rome, as well to such straungers as were dispersed and scattered abroade in the countreys of <hi>Pontus, Galatia, capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotia, &amp;c.</hi> by occasion of persecution, as to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers inhabitantes of the same cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>treys among whiche he had preached in his longe and payne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full progresse, and had conuerted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Christes fayeth, whiche all he counted as straungers to the worlde. And so in the seconde chapter of this epistle, he prayeth them to take them selues, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge: <hi>Obsecro vos tanquam aduenas &amp; peregrinos.</hi> Euen like as we haue in the actes of the apostles xv. That saint Paul after he had planted Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes Gospel in the countreys where he hadde la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
<pb n="cvi" facs="tcp:12050:122"/>
preachynge, he vsed to take an oportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and conuenient tyme to go throughe agayne from place to place to visite them, and to se whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they persisted and stode as firme and fast in fayeth as he had left them. In like case Saynte Peter hauynge so busie a piece of worke and so great a charge on his hande, as to teache al that huge and great citie of Rome, then being lordes and rulers of the worlde, in whiche then was in maner a confusion of all vices and synnes, of all opinions, of all supersticions and errours by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of all nacions resortynge thither, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisions of causes which doubtles brought wyth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the supersticions, and the vices<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and noughty liuynges of their countreys, as wee se by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, where little co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>course of straungers is, there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> is playne maner of liuyng, and after one maner, but in port townes they be of an other sort. The Germayns and Sarons brynge in their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The Frenchmen their new fashions. Other cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>treis geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to lechery, runne to the open bars or stues. And for such co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the inhabita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes. Saint Peter in the ende of this his first epistle calleth Rome by the name of Babilo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as you shal heare (by Goddes helpe) when wee shall come to that place. For this exceadyng charge that, s. Peter had take vpon him, he might not intende to go amonge them agayne, to confirme theim, and to make them more stedfaste in fayeth, but sent to them this excellent and noble epistle, ful of fatherly counsayle, whiche they myght euery day read, to make them remember their maister,
<pb facs="tcp:12050:123"/>
and to liue accordynge to hys doctryne that he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> hadde geuen theim. But nowe riseth a doubt of no smal importaunce. Saint Paule in his epistle to the Galatheis in the firste Chapiter, saythe that after his conuersion he toke his iourney in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Arabye, and after he had laboured a season in that countrey, he retourned agayne and came to <hi>Damascus</hi> (the chiefe citye of Siria. <hi>Esay. vii. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put Syrie Damascus.</hi>) And then after three yeres of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersion, he came to Hierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to see Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp; taryed there with him. xv. dayes, &amp; there he sawe none other of the apostles at that tyme, but onely saynt Peter and Iames the lesse called Christes brother, whiche then was made bishop and ouerseer of Christes churche in Hierusalem: For all the residue of the apostles were then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed abrode to preache the worde of GOD. After this Saynt Paule (as he sayeth) went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> into the coastes of <hi>Siria</hi> and <hi>Celicia,</hi> where he was brought vp in youth.

Paul came againe to Ierusalem to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the gospel that he preached, with the apostles y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were the pillers of the Church, Peter, Iames, and Iohn, whiche he founde then at Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem. Nowe good frendes take hede. Heare we haue of saynt Paule whiche in the place alledged
<pb n="cvii" facs="tcp:12050:123"/>
swore, &amp; toke god to witnes, that he lyed not, we may wel beleue hym, &amp; must nedes so do, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> gost spoke in him. Here (I saie) we haue firste iii. yeres next after Paules conuersion afore his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mynge to Hierusalem, when he taryed there wyth Peter fiftene dayes. And then we haue fouretene yeares more afore he came to Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem to conferre hys preachynge wyth the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Apostles, and at bothe tymes he founde Sayncte Peter at Hierusalem. So that by this wee haue, that Saynte PETER was at Hierusalem, seuentene yeares and more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Christes ascention, for .s. Paul was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted in the first yere after Christes ascentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary next after as the church represe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth, at that tyme, kepyng the feast of the conuersion of S. Paule. Nowe (I praye you) when went sainte Peter abroade amonge them that were disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in <hi>Pontus, Galatia, Capadocia, &amp;c</hi>? And when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> was he bishoppe of <hi>Anthiochia</hi>? To this I saye that as for the three firste yeares that Saynte Paule spoke of, Saynte Peter taried verye much at Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wyth Iames, there to order the Primatyue &amp; first churche of Christe in all the worlde. Their presence because they were of hyghe reputation, was verye necessarye for that purpose, so that in all that tyme I thynke he went verye little amonge the Gentyles, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte it were by some chaunce, or by reuelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as he came to <hi>Cornelius</hi> at <hi>Caesaria.</hi> His most laboure was aboute the conuersion of Iewes, to conuerte them to Christe.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:12050:124"/>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Then afterwarde in the .xiiii. yere that .s. Paule speaketh of (the churche of Hierusalem beynge reasonablye well stablished) there is no doubte but saint Peter went abrode into all countreys preachynge Christe chieflye to the Iewes that were dispersed into many cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>treys, there liuyng like straungers, after the persecution that roose after the martirdome of saint Stephan, and for many such troubles as fel vpon them, exhorting them to pacience, and declarynge that throughe many troubles wee muste come into the kynge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God. And in this time he sticked for no labours, but came to the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>treys of <hi>Pontus Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiae. &amp;c.</hi> Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>treys of mayne <hi>Asia,</hi> of which some of them be almost as farre north east from Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, as we be northwest, and to them prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Christes fayth, and returnyng backe, came againe to <hi>Antiochia,</hi> where he taried and ruled Christes flocke as bishoppe there by the space of seuen yeres or more. Saint Hierome sayth. <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Gal. ii. Primum episcopum Antiochene ecclesiae Petrum fuisse accepimus, &amp; Romam exinde transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi> From <hi>Antiochia</hi> he wente to Rome to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince <hi>Simon Magus</hi> (as I saide afore.) And from Rome came backe agayne vnto Hierusalem to a counsail in the eyghtenth yere after Christes as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention, at which time .s. Paule was warned by reuelation to ascende also to Hierusalem to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre his Gospell wyth the other Apostles, and there met with Peter, Iames, and Iohn, as he sayth in the seconde chapiter to the Galathians. And then saynt Peter toke his leaue and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="cvii" facs="tcp:12050:124"/>
to Rome againe, where he continued, and in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the countreys thereabout to his liues ende. And from thence he wrote this Epistle as I sayde. Now if I shall perfourme the exposition of this epistle, as I haue taken vpon me, I must some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what speake of these countreys that saint Peter rehearseth here in the salutation of his letter, for here they be written as you haue heard. <hi>Pontus, Galatia, Capadocia,</hi> and so furth.

To all faythfull people, as well Iewes as Gentyles, dispersed as straungers here and there in the saide countreis. S. Peter wrytte his epistle, and he calleth them <hi>electe</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:12050:129"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> chosen by the knowledge of God the father, not excludynge the sonne, or the holye Gooste, for the prescience, foreknowledge, and knowledge, is all one in all three personnes in trinitie. Whom the father doth predestinate or choose to grace or to saluation, the same doth the sonne, and also the holye Gooste, predestinate and chuse to be saued. Theyr workes amonge creatures be all one, but in as muche as Saynte Peter calleth theym that he writeth vnto, <hi>electe and chosen by the knoweledge of GOD the father,</hi> We muste not thynke that all they that were conuerted to <hi>CHRISTES</hi> fayth, in the sayde countreis to whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che Sainte Peter wrote, were electe by suche election as Christe speaketh of in the parable. <hi>Math. xxii. Multi sunt vocati, pauci vero electi.</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Manye be called, and but fewe chosen, for here it is meaned, that fewe be chosen fynallye to be saued, and to be sure of lyfe euerlastynge. It is not to be thoughte that Saynte Peter would make to all them that he wrote vnto, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye suche assuraunce, but he taketh election more largelye, as Christe speaketh of it, <hi>Nonne ego vos duodecim elegi, &amp; vnus ex vobis Diabolus est? Ioh. vi.</hi> Dydde not I chose you twelue, and one of you is the Deuylles birde. And also, <hi>Ioh. xv. Non vos me elegistis, sed ego elegi vos.</hi> You haue not chosen me, but I haue chosen you: Where we muste vnderstande by this election, the vocation and callinge to the faith, and to beleue on Christe: for neyther they that this
<pb n="cxii" facs="tcp:12050:129"/>
was spoken to, nor any other were chosen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> they beleued on <hi>CHRISTE,</hi> but because <hi>CHRISTE</hi> chose theym, therefore they beleued on hym, so that <hi>GODDES</hi> eternall election was the cause of oure vocation to fayth. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Sainte Paule sayth, <hi>Ephes. i. Elegit nos in ipso ante mundi constitutionem. GOD</hi> the father chose vs in <hi>CHRISTE,</hi> afore the worlde was made, he chose vs to be saued by the fayth of <hi>CHRISTE,</hi> whiche is the onelye and verye ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarye waye to saluation. Nowe to my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, all these people of these countreis to whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che Saynt Peter wrytte, were electe and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen by the prescience and foreknowledge of GOD, to be called, and to come to Christes fayth, and to continue in the same as <hi>GOD</hi> knew.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
               <hi>GOD knewe who were his,</hi> that woulde final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye continue in <hi>CHRISTES</hi> fayth, and be saued, and who woulde fall frome the same to infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie agayne, or by sinne and misliuinge deface and defoule theyr fayth, and be dampned.</p>
            <p>But here yet riseth a doubte, for Saynte Paule sayth. <hi>Roman. vii, Quos presciuit &amp; predestinauit hos &amp; vocauit. &amp;c.</hi> Theim that he afore knewe and dydde predestinate, he called: and them that he called, he iustified: and them that he iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he magnified, and glorified, and appointed finallye to glorie euerlasting. Therefore it shuld seme, that if they were called, they were iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and if they were iustified, then muste it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des folowe that they were gloryfyed.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:12050:130"/>Here you muste vnderstande that there is two <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> maners of calling or chosinge, one is, <hi>secundum presentem iustitiam,</hi> accordinge to a certayne iust maner of liuinge that men be of for the tyme of theyr callinge, and as they appeare in the face of the worlde, as the scripture speaketh of Saule. <hi>i.

So Iudas when he was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen was good ynough, although he afterwarde betrayed his mayster and ours. For this kinde of callinge doth not so confirme men in goodnes, but that they may fall and be noughte, &amp; so was Saul, and so was Iudas, and so were manye of them that S. Peter writte vnto, although thei were called and chosen to Christes faith by the ministery and labour of S. Peter, S. Paule, or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of others of the Apostles. There is another elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, chosinge, or callinge, whiche is <hi>secundum dei propositum,</hi> accordinge to Goddes determinate purpose. Of this S.

Therefore I say (to the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of S. Peters epistle) they were elect and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen,
<pb n="cxiii" facs="tcp:12050:130"/>
as God knewe that all shoulde come to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> faith of Christe, <hi>In sanctificationem spiritus</hi> to be sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctified in spirite by baptisme, and to haue their soules in the way of saluation <hi>in sanctificationem spiritus</hi> saith the vulgate and comon text, <hi>per sanc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tificationem spiritus in obedientiam. &amp;c.</hi> saythe the newe translation and they come all to one pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.

Origene <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> vpon a like blessing saith, I think that this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of peace &amp; grace which is giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Gods wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloued serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Apostels writeth, is no lesse of strength the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the blessyng that the holy Patriarch Noe gaue vnto his sonnes, Sem and Iaphet, which was fulfylled by the holye Goste vpon them that were so blessed. And lykewyse no lesse strength then the blessing that Abraham had of Melchisedeche, or then the blessynge that Iacob had of his father Isaac, or then the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that the twelue Patriarches hadde of theyr father Israell. Then I saye that thys blessynge that Saynt Peter gaue theym that he wrytte
<pb n="cxv" facs="tcp:12050:132"/>
vnto, was no lesse then the sayde blessinges, for he had in hym selfe the holye spirite, and in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> holye spirite he wryt hys letter, and in the same spirite he gaue his blessing. Then by the same holye spirite they shall take theyr blessynges that be blessed of the Apostles, or of theym that haue the holye spirite wythin them, speciallye if they be founde worthye, and in whom the blessynge maye fall, or els the sayinge of Christe shall bee brought to passe that he saythe in the Gospell: <hi>Si fuerit ibi filius pacis pax vestra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> veniet super eum, sin autem pax vestra ad vos reuertetur</hi>: If there be the chylde of peace, your peace shall fall vpon hym, and if no, your peace shall retourne to you agayne. And that is wrytte of peace, is lykewyse to be vnderstande of grace, for Saynte Peter ioyneth together grace and peace, for peace is neuer withoute a speciall grace of GOD, nor grace without peace. Therefore where is lacke of grace, there canne be no peace, and where wee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> haue no peace, wee maye be sorye that wee lacke grace. This grace and peace the Apostle prayeth that it maye be multiplyed vppon them that he wrytte vnto, that is to saye, that it maye growe and encrease euer more and more from daye to daye. And because hys meanynge was not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye by theym that he had seen wyth hys bodelye eyes in the countries where he hadde laboured, but also to all other nations that shoulde heare or see thys hys blessed Epistle. It is not to be doubted but thys blessyng of grace and peace he wysheth also to vs, speciallye if we may saye
<pb facs="tcp:12050:133"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> wyth the Prophet: <hi>Aduena egosum apud te &amp; peregrinus sicut omnes patres mei.

He entended by his writing to confirme theym and vs by theym in the faithe that they and wee haue receiued by the preaching of the woorde of God, &amp; in vertuous liuing, agreinge to the same: He beginneth his processe with laudes and than<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes to God the father of heauen, for his aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant and great mercy, in this that he hath rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate and begotten vs againe to lyfe by our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ. Where we afore by our carnall pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes were generate and gotten to dye. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he saythe, blessed be God and father of oure Lorde Iesu Christ (that is to saye) God that is the father of our Lord Iesu Christ the first per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> in trinitie, fountain, wel, and original begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the whole trinitie, to which saynt Peter geueth his laudes and thankes, not excluding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny person in trinitie, for the father and the sonne, and the holy Gost haue all one Godhead, equall glory and coeternall maiestie. For this you must vnderstande that thys word <hi>blessed</hi> hath diuers significations according to the thinge that it is ioyned withall. When we say blesse God, or saye blessed be GOD, it is a woorde of thankes, and is as muche to saye as laude, prayse, and than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes be to GOD.

Therefore when hee blesseth vs, hee gyueth vs some gyfte of grace or temporall subsidye and healpe by his mere liberalitye and gentlenesse, and not of dutie nor of our deseruinge. Thyrde when the father or a frende blesseth the chyld, he giueth him temporall goodes, or wysheth hym well, and prayeth for him well to doe, as Isaac blessed hys sonnes, Iacob and Esau, and lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse Iacob and other holye Fathers blessed theyr children, as I sayde of Sainte Peters blessynge in the later ende of the salutacion of this Epistle. Saynte Peter (as I sayde) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynneth wyth thankes, offeringe to GOD at the beginninge a sacrifice of laude, remembryng the sayinge of the Prophet: <hi>Sacrificium laudis ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norificabit <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> me:</hi> The sacrifice of laude and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singe, shall doe me honour saithe almighty God. And like as hee that will doe bodely sacrifice to God, muste doe it by the handes of a Priest, or of a Byshoppe.

and to be concurrent and workynge wyth vs in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> all our affayres and proceadynges in oure busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. <hi>Qui secundum misericordiam suam magnam regenerauit nos in spem viua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> per resurrectione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Iesu christi ex mortuis.</hi> Whiche accordynge to hys great mercye by the resurrection of Iesu Christ from amonge the deade, hathe begotten vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into a liuelye hope.

his strength at Christes passion came of mercy, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> yea of great mercy, and of manifold mercy. Our firste father Adam at his firste creation had the supernatural gifte of originall iustice, geuen him for him selfe, and for all his posteritie and issue. This gift of originall iustice in him made a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect tranquillitie and quietnes in al the powers of his soule, so that his will by this originall iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice shuld obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly do after the pleasure of god, and all the inferiour sensible powers, should like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise obeye the wyll so directed and ruled by ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall iustice, the will should haue preuented the sensible powers, so that vnlawefull appetites should neuer haue bene in them. As, for to synne in adulterye with an other mans wyfe, or for to steale or take away an other mans goodes, Men shoulde haue hadde none such vnlawfull lustes. And by the same gyft the wyll should haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the sensible powers at tyme and place <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> conuenient, to exercise their appetites accordyng to iustice. As to vse naturall generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at tymes conuenient with a mans owne wife, to eate and drinke as reason and iustice would. There shuld haue bene no discention, stryfe, or debate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixte man and man, but continual rest &amp; peace. And in thys case, all mankinde should haue bene if Adam hadde kepte his obedience to almighty GOD, but as a punishemente for his disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God, all hys inferiour powers disobeyed their superiours. And this gyfte of originall Iustyce was geuen hym for hym selfe, and for
<pb n="cxviii" facs="tcp:12050:135"/>
all hys posteritie. And therefore lyke as God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> woulde hym to haue kepte it, so he woulde all hys posteritye to haue dooen, and requireth it of all menne and women that euer came of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam by carnall propagacion, for wee all ought to haue it. And therefore almightye GOD iustelye requireth of euerye persone hauynge in hym the nature of manne, that gyfte of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Iustyce whyche hee gaue to the whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of manne. And nowe the lacke of that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall Iustyce wyth the debte or duetye to haue it, is called <hi>originall synne,</hi> whyche ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all the Issue and children of Adam, the chyldrene of Goddes indignation and anger. And so wee by that bee lefte free from Iustice and bonde to synne and to dampnation. A my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable case that wee be in synne, and be made the chyldrene of anger and of dampnation afore wee haue the vse of Reason, and afore wee can <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> dooe anye synne. And beside that wee be made subiecte to all miserie, vexation, syckenesse, and trouble whyle wee be here. For if Adam hadde kepte hys obedience to GOD, there shoulde nothynge haue disobeyed vs, nother wynde, nor rayne, heate, nor colde to distemper vs. And then to consider howe for thee lacke of the sayde gyfte of originall Iustyce, wee be so prone and headstronge to all actuall Synnes, as to pride, couetuousnesse, anger, enuye, and such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whyche all make agaynste saluation, and worketh to dampnation euerlastynge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:12050:136"/>All these miseries and wretchednes considered, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> it is playne that mankynde hath nede of greate mercy and manifolde and abundant mercy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue hym. And therfore Saynt Peter sayde that <hi>almightye God by his greate mercye regenerate vs, and gote vs again to life,</hi> agaynst al these mortal &amp; deadly miseries. The regeneration &amp; new beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng, is by the water of baptisme, wyth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words &amp; the cooperation and working of the holy spirit without whiche, no man maye see the kyngdome and glorye of God. By this the dutye or debt of originall iustice is washed away, so that GOD will require it no more of vs, but he geueth vs in the stede of the sayde originall Iustice, an other gyfte equiualent, and as good to helpe vs to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as it was, whiche is the grace that maketh <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> vs in the fauoure of God againe, and acceptable to hym. This gifte God sendeth into our soules, with fayth at our Baptisme, and will still at all tymes require it of vs lyke as afore he required the saide originall iustice, so that the former debt and dutye of originall Iustice, is chaunged into this latter debte and dutie, to conserue and kepe the grace geuen vs at our baptisme. And yet the mercy of God is so great toward miserable ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that if it mischaunce vs to lose the same baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall grace by sinne, he hath prouided vs an other helpe, the seconde table, a seconde remedy, by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce to washe awaye our sinnes, and to make vs cleane againe, that we may recouer his grace and fauour. So that like as originall iustice (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it was lost) was recompensed by the grace of
<pb n="cxix" facs="tcp:12050:136"/>
baptisme, so the grace of baptisme after it is lost by actuall sinne, is recompensed by grace geuen vs with remission of our sinne bi penance. And so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> loke how necessary baptisme is to wash vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the deformitie of originall sinne, and to restore vs to grace, so necessary is pena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to clense vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>formitie of actual sinne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted after baptisme &amp; to restore vs to grace &amp; fauour of god. And eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> like as God requireth originall iustice of al men that be not baptised, as of Turkes, Saracens, Paignims, and Infidels, which all receiued it in Adam, and as for lacke of it, they remayne the children of anger &amp; of damnation, so of al that be christened he requireth the said grace geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with baptisme, &amp; they that haue lost it by deadly sinne remaine the children of damnation, except thei be healed by penaunce, whiche shal geue them grace <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> equiualent to the baptismal grace, like as I said that baptisme geueth grace equiualent to origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall iustice.

By this regeneration also all actuall synnes, mortall and veniall be cleane forgeuen, when anye manne or woman dothe

Then the hope of hym that will hope and loke to come to heauen, and wyll doe no good thynge to brynge him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is a deade hope, and a presumption rather then hope. Thys considered the blessed manne Iob, whose hope on God was so firme and sure that he sayde. <hi>Etiam si occiderit me, in ipso spera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo.

If God had not preserued our mooste gratious Soueraigne Kinge Henry the eyght, whiche by his princelie zele, loue, and deuotion to God, hath erecte this Cathedrall Churche of Bristowe, and manye other suche within this Realme, God knoweth what case diuine seruice should haue bene in.

Seconde how freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and many infirmities raigneth: we see dayly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of pestilence, pockes great and small, &amp; these new burninge agues, and innumerable o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, more then the Phisicions haue written of in their bookes. These contaminate and defow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth mens bodies by infections, aches and paines euen to death. And what corruption and infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of maners commeth to the soule, by euill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, ill wordes, and suche other occasions, it were to long to be spoken of nowe. Thirde, the comon sterilitie and barennes of the grounde, the great scarsitie of all maner of vitall and of frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of the earth, we feele it so many times to our great paine and discomfort, that it nede not to be declared.

There is no feablenes of sicknes, ther is none infection of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy by corrupt ayre, nor of soule by temptacion or by euill example, for into that glorious citie and dwelling place can no vncleane thynge enter or come. Thirde, there shall nothing welow or wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther away, but shall euer be kept freshe and floo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing by that well of life almighty God.

<pb facs="tcp:12050:139"/>
what beutie and brightnes shal our soules haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> when our bodies shall be as bright as the sunne? There shal be no heauines, no labour, no payne, no sorowe, no feare, no death, but euer still shall continue health of bodye and minde. There shall neuer rise discentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or debate betwixt neighbour and neighbour, no miserie, no nede or necessitye, no hunger, no thurst, no cold to hurt the, ne heate to enflame thee, no faintnes for fasting, no slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardie for much eating, no temptacion of oure gostly enemies. The fleshe shal not resist against the spirite, ther shal be no wil to sinne, nor possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie to offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. But our sauiour Christ wil giue vs suche pleasure with the companye and felow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the glorious angels, as no hart can think nor any tonge expresse. <hi>This ioyfull inheritaunce is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> conserued and kept in store in heauen</hi> (saith sainte Peter) <hi>for you that by vertue and power of god be kept by faith vnto saluation, whiche is readye to be shewed in the last time at the generall iudgement.</hi> Here he saithe that this inheritaunce is kepte in store, not for all men that be regenerate by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, but onely for suche as perseuer and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in goodnes to the ende by Gods speciall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation. For perseuerance commeth principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye of God, and of our selfe but secundarelye, and is necessary for all them that will be saued. <hi>Nam in cassum bonum agitur si ante terminum vite dese<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratur</hi> saith saint Gregory.

the vttermost of it, or be come to the ende, is lyke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> an Ape, whose condition is, when he tasteth the vtter hull or huske of an nutte, and perceiueth it sowre and bitter, casteth awaye the nutte afore he hathe tasted the swetenes of the curnell. And cur Sauiour Christ saith in the parable of hym that woulde borowe breade of hys neyghbour. <hi>Luke. xi. Si perseuerauerit pulsans &amp;c. If he continue still knockyng, if hys frende wyll not giue it hym because he is his frende, yet for hys importunitie &amp; continuall crauynge he wyll ryse and gyue him as manye as he hath neede of.</hi> And he telleth vs what is the instrument or meane by which God dothe preserue vs, and make vs to perseuer and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in grace and good liuynge. It is faithe and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> suche lyke faithe as I spoke of hope euen nowe, sayinge: that <hi>God hath regenerate vs by hys greate mercye into a lyuelye hope,</hi> and so the faythe by whyche GOD keepeth vs, is a lyuelye faithe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with Charitie and with good woorkes accordinglye.

Fayth maketh vs to vnderstande the fylthe and vncleanenesse of synne, that so wee maye abhorre synne, and flee from it. <hi>Hec est victoria que vincit mundum fides nostra, i.

Faith also maketh vs to know that the Apostle saith, <hi>Si secundum carnem vixeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis. moriemini,</hi> if ye liue after the pleasures of the fleshe, ye shall die, wherefore if ye haue folowed your carnall pleasures, eating and drinking, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealing and rioting in this holye time of Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas lately past, which ye should haue spent in de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uotion and holynes, ye muste repent your faulte, and do penaunce therefore. Faith maketh vs to contemne and dispise worldly wealth and riches as the dyuels mowse snatch, and snare, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a man to catche &amp; hold others mens goodes so long till the diuell hath caught them and hold them in his danger. Saint Paule saith: <hi>i.

Fayth contempneth &amp; despiseth honours, as a fome on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning water, as smoke, or as sleepe.

but yet holow it is without any stuffe in it, and for nothing good at length. So honour and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> riches maketh me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to swell and grow vp to great estimation, yet comonly holowe they be, and void without vertue or good conditions or good wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes. Smoke when it riseth vp out of the chimny, it shooteth vp a great higthe, and then swelleth abrode as it were into a great cloude, but anon it vanisheth away and commeth to nothing. And euen so dothe riche mens honour and goodes, as we see by dayly experience. Sleepe is myngeled with many dreames of riches, landes, possessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and carnall pleasures, but when they haue slepte out their dreame, and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they wake it is away they fynde nothinge in theyr handes, of all that they had pleasure of in their dreames. So dothe al transitorie pleasures, in them is no stedfast se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie.

Peter exhorte you to be fast, sure, and sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast in the good opinions that you haue bene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced vnto by catholike preachers, where afore by pseudapostles, and leude preachers, you were seduced and broughte into sinistre opinions, in whiche you walked darkely and blyndely, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempninge the sacramentes and ceremonies of Christes churche, and so vsinge a leude libertye, you fell to all desires of darke ignoraunce, liuing carnally, nother regardinge prayers, fasting, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence, nor chastitie For surely this is the effect of suche lewde libertie, as some men would ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and claime by the Gospell, where there is nothinge more contrary to the Gospell. <hi>Et si pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem inuocatis eum quae sine personarum acceptio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne iudicat. &amp;c.</hi> In these wordes the Apostle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swadeth, and reasoneth, that we oughte to be of cleane lyfe, sobre and perfecte, that we maye obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diently, and reuerently hope and loke for glorye at the reuelation and comminge of Christ in his glory, sayinge: <hi>If you call him your father that iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth without parcialitie according to euery persons worke, see that you be conuersaunt in feare (and in your conuersation haue feare) for the time that you be here abidinge in this worlde.</hi> In which wordes he willeth vs to considre almightie God as oure father, and also as our iudge. In that he is oure
<pb facs="tcp:12050:151"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> iudge, we owe vnto him feare, as to oure Lorde and maister, that maye do with vs what shall please him, and in that he is our father, we owe vnto him loue, as to oure maker and regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour. Accordinge to the saying of <hi>Malachi. i. Si pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ego sum vbi est honor meus, si dominus ego sum vbi est timor meus.</hi> If I be youre father as you call me, <hi>Pater noster qui es in coelis,</hi> where is the ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nour that you owe to me? If I be youre lorde, where is the feare that you owe to me. Saynte Peter ioyneth them both together, meaninge that we owe vnto almightie God loue, as to our father, and feare, as to our lorde and iudge, and specially because he iudgeth withoute parcialitie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> or affection to any partie, hauinge respecte to a mannes workes, and not to the personne. But yet here riseth a doubte vppon Saynte Peters wordes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that God iudgeth without parcialitie, it semeth contrary, by the wordes of Malachye the Prophet aforesaid, where the worde of God sayd by that Prophet in the fyrst Chapter, <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne frater erat Esau Iacob, dicit dominus &amp; dilexi Iacob, Esau autem odio habui.</hi> They had done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good nor yll, as S. Paule sayth. <hi>Roman. ix.</hi> therefore not for any thinge of their parte God sayde, <hi>I loued Iacob, and I hated Esau,</hi> and then in verye dede, for that that God loued Iacob, Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob proued a good man, and for that he hated Esau, Esau proued nought, and all his posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie for the mooste part. And Iacob for his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and for good workes folowinge of the same was saued, where Esau, or they of hys
<pb n="cxxvi" facs="tcp:12050:151"/>
issue, for theyr noughtie liuinge, were reproued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and dampned: therefore, of this it semeth that God was partiall in his election, because there was no cause in the parties wherfore one shuld be electe rather then the other, and also in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quele that came thereof, dampninge Esau or them that were noughty and yll of his issue, and sauinge Iacob for his goodnes and vertue whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che God gaue hym. Therefore (by this obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) it semeth not true that Saint Peter sayth, that God oure father iudgeth without parciali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, in as muche as it semeth he was partiall in these two personnes Iacob and Esau, as well in the predestination and election of them afore they were borne, as in the course of theyr lyues, and in the maners of theyr lyuinges, and fynal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> in the saluation of the one, and reprobation or dampnation of the other. For aunswere to this obiection you muste vnderstand, that when there be anye two personnes, hauinge on theyr owne parte, or in them selues equally, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or cause why they shoulde be wylled, loued, or accepted, then the will of him that accepteth, or loueth the one rather then the other, offendeth by acception of personnes, or by partialitie. As if we compare any two thinges to the wyll of a creature, as to my will, or to thy will, if thou loue or fauoure one more then the other, there is some iust cause, or (at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lest wise) some apparau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t cause, why thou fauoreste the one more then the other, for the goodnes in the thinge that is loued
<pb facs="tcp:12050:152"/>
or els the apparaunte goodnes in it, is the cause <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> why we do loue it. But speakinge of the will of God, there is nothinge, no goodnes in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that causeth or maketh the will of God to loue it. For the thinge that is temporall &amp; tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitory, causeth not the thinge that is eternall, as is the election, predestination, and fauour or loue in God: but rather contrarywise the wil of God is cause of all goodnes in man. And therefore God can not be partiall, neither accepter of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, because in man, or any other creature, ther is no goodnes of our owne that shuld make god, or cause God to loue vs, but that he loueth vs as he loued Iacob, before he had done other good or yll, it commeth of Goddes mere grace and libera<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>litie, and not of Iacobs deseruinge nor of ours, and in this doinge, he doth no wronge to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther partie that is reproued, as Esau was, for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> generallye, iniustice or wronge hath no place, where a thinge is geuen of mere grace, if it be ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uen to the one and not to the other, for grace or fauour may be geuen to one and not to an other without any iniustice or wronge to the other par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie. As appeareth playnely. <hi>Math. xx.</hi> of them that were hyred to worke in the vineyarde, of whiche some came to worke <hi>primo mane,</hi> earlye in the morning, and some at fiue of the clocke at night, and yet they had equall wages, they that came laste, as much as they that came fyrst. And when some that had laboured all day grudged therat, and complayned to the maister and owner of the vineyarde, because they had laboured all day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
<pb n="cxxxv" facs="tcp:12050:152"/>
borne the burthen and the heate of the day, and had no more wages then they that had laboured <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> but one houre, they were aunswered one for all. <hi>Amice non facio ribi iniuriam, tolle quod tuum est et vade.</hi> He hadde no wronge, that the other that came laste, was made as farre forth as he that came fyrste, because it stode in the mere libertie and grace of the mayster, to bestowe his monye as it pleased him, as he sayde: <hi>An non licet mihi quod volo facere?</hi> May not I do with mine owne as it pleaseth me. As S. Paule saith. <hi>Rom. ix. An non habet potestatem figulus. &amp;c.</hi> Hathe not the pitcher maker of cley, power to make of one peece of cley, one vessel to do honest seruice at the boorde, and an other to do vyle offices? so in oure purpose, in as muche as it stode in Goddes mere libertie, to minde or wyll to Iacob and to Esau as it pleased him, Esau had no wronge by that that Iacob was electe, neither almightie God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> was partiall in sauinge the one, and not sauinge the other, for there was no cause geuen of thone more then of thother. And euen so sayth S.

Why doth one neighboure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue an other nowe in this fayre time, by false weightes or measures, by false lyghtes, by false oothes? because they feare not God that hath forbid vs so to do.

So might our sauiour Christ say that the storme of temptation, that the deuill by Gods permissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, raysed against our first parents and ceasseth not with the same stormes to assault all his posteritye, was raysed for Christes sake, because y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deuil knew that the godhed &amp; ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>hode of Christ shold be ioyned in one person, &amp; so shold be exalted farre aboue hym, the enuy that he had at this, made him to bende his ordinance, &amp; to set furth all his engins of te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptation against ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kind to stop him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that exaltation &amp; honor.

<pb facs="tcp:12050:159"/>
a signe that euen so it was in Gods foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and election, that firste he determined the sonne to be incarnate, and mankinde to come to that glorye, to be one person wyth God, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundarilye, knowyng that Adam would fall, &amp; would bringe all hys posteritie into daunger of damnation: the high counsaile of the Godhead appoynted our saide Sauiour Christe to be the meane to saue ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kinde again by his blessed pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that he should suffer in his passible and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall body, which he toke vppon him for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. For in very dede if Adam had not offended.

               </gap>en preached among you, (saith saint Peter) by me &amp; by other Apostles. By this holye woorde of God you were first instruct and taughte to leaue your old vaine errours and vices, and to renounce the deuyll wyth all his pompe and all his naughtye workes. And by the word of God concurrent and ioyned with the element of water, you wer bapti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed &amp; goten to Christ, &amp; made his children, wher afore you were the children of Gods yre &amp; of dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, as all they be that after that waye be not new borne to God by baptisme. The former carnall generation or birthe saueth no man nor woman, the seconde doth, and therefore it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie for all them that shal be saued, what sexe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> kynde or age so euer they be of, contrarye to the secte and heresy of the Anabaptists that woulde haue no man baptised till they were of yeares of discretion, in so much that they baptise again al them that in childhoode were christened, leauing all youth in dispeyre of saluation withoute anye way or helpe to be saued, and in worse case then the infantes of the Iewes were, which by Moi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ses law should be circumcised on the eyght daye after they were borne, and by that circumcision should not perish but be saued. For as saint Paul saith. <hi>Roma. v. Si vnius delicto multi mortui sunt, multo magis gratia dei &amp; donum vnius hominis Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>su Christi in plures homines abundauit.</hi> Wher the Apostle compareth the offence of Adam to the
<pb n="cxlii" facs="tcp:12050:161"/>
grace of Christ, for the grace of Christe is muche <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> stronger and may extende and sprede it selfe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the offence of one pure and frayle man might do, therefore in asmuche as death crept in among men by one Adam, then muche more by our sauiour Christ one man and God in one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, of power infinite, the gift of grace is dilated and spred vpon all men that be made apte to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it, which is onely by baptisme actuallye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, or els in vowe or purpose. And therefore in asmuche as the synne of Adam killed all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantes, it must needes be that Christes grace in the sacrament of baptisme shal quicken the same infantes, and make theym spirituallye alyue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in Christe, or els (as I sayde) it shoulde be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> weaker then Adams synne, &amp; also because Christ saith. <hi>Iohn. iii. Nisi quis renatus fuerit ex aqua et spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritu sancto non potest introire in regnum dei.</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a manne be borne againe by water and the holye spirite, he cannot entre into the kyngdome of heauen. And euen lyke as they that were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised in theyr infansye, knewe not what it meaned that they suffered with great paine, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perceyued anye thinge of the promysse that God made to them that suffred it. In like maner baptysme saueth oure chyldren infauntes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe they perceyue nothynge what is done vnto them, neyther the reason thereof. But Christ that saide: <hi>Sinite paruulos venire ad me. Mathewe. xix.</hi> Let babes or children come to me, hathe prouyded armes to beare theym to hym,
<pb facs="tcp:12050:162"/>
which be the armes of our mother holy church, by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> whose eares also they be cathechised or instruct, and by her mouthe they confesse their faithe, and in her faith they be saued. And this is very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable that other mens faith may helpe in thys sacrament of soule health, as wel as other mens faith hath helped them that haue be bodely disea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed in sicknes and sores of theyr bodie, speciallye because God estemeth and regardeth more the health of the soule then of the bodye. We haue in the gospell of the Canaan womans doughter, that by the importune sute and prayer of her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther she was delyuered from the dyuell that she was obsessed with all: <hi>O mulier magna est fides tua fiat tibi sicut vis: Math. xv. fides tua (inquit) non fides filie.</hi> And also <hi>Centurio</hi> a captain in <hi>Capharnaum</hi> came to Christ, praying him to helpe his seruant that was yll vexed with a paulsy, Christ offered to come him selfe to the mans house, &amp; to heale <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> his seruaunt. No (saith he) I am not worthye to receiue you into my house, but once say the word and my seruant shall be whole, and according to his beliefe so he sped, for his seruant was whole by and by, after the maister had confessed his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe. An other that was impotent by a pawlsye, and his frendes coulde finde no waye to bringe him to Christe for preasse of people that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him in the house. At the last they were fame to vntile the house and let him in by the roofe of the house. <hi>Quorum fidem vt vidit, dixit, homo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittuntur tibi peccata tua, et ait paralitico tibi dico, surge, tolle lectum tuum &amp; vade in domum tuam.
<pb n="cxliii" facs="tcp:12050:162"/>
Luke. v. &amp;. Mark. ii.</hi> He saw the faith of them that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> so conueyed the syckeman in at the roofe of the house, and forgaue the man his sinnes, and cured him of his pawlsy, at the contemplation of theyr faith that brought him to Christe. And this texte maketh plainly for our purpose, for here it appea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reth that by the faith of other men, this sickman had aswell soule health as bodely healthe, for he had his sinnes forgiuen him for his soule health, and was rid of his pawsy for his bodely healthe. And euen so it was generallye of Christes cures that he did, which were euer full and perfite, for he healed the whole man, soule and bodye: for he vsed not to heale the bodye, but he woulde fyrste heale the soule, because that the infirmities of the body commeth comonly of the sinnes and sycke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the soule, either originall or actuall. The Gospels hath many suche examples, in whiche it is plaine that the belief and praiers of others hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth against bodely sickenes, then muche more it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> helpeth against this daungerous sickenes of the soule, that is originall synne, the common malan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der and mischiefe of all the issue of Adam, which if it be not cured and healed, wyll surely let hym that is diseased with it, from the sight of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of God for euer. For (as I saide) God regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth more the health of the soule, then of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And consideringe that the infantes haue the said originall sinne by an other mans preuaricati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on and transgression, reasonable it is that they be releued and discharged of the same, by the meane of other mens faith, as by the vniuersall
<pb facs="tcp:12050:163"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> faith of the church, and by the faith of the godfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and godmothers and of other assistents at the christening of the childe, so that we muste not exclude or denie the mercye &amp; grace of God from any man or woman borne into this worlde, but that after their bodelye birthe to death, they be new borne to life by Gods holye worde, and by water with the inspiration of grace of the holye spirite, the holye Gost. And by this that I haue said you maye answer to the chiefe reason of the Anabaptistes that they vse against the said veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, alledging that Christ sayth. <hi>Math xviii. Qui crederit &amp; baptisatus fuerit, saluus erit.</hi> He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leueth and is baptised, shall be saued: and he that beleueth not shal be dampned. Of this they take that it is necessary for him that shall be baptised, that he beleue. Now say they, infantes lackynge the vse of reason cannot beleue, therefore they be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> vnmete to be baptised. I tolde you that they be saued by the beliefe of the church, and beleueth in the beliefe of the church, and in the belief of theyr Godfathers and godmothers, &amp; other assistents representing the church, as I declared by diuers examples of the gospell, as wel of soule health as of bodely health, procured of Christ by the belief of others, or els (as the scholasticall doctours sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> very well) in receyuing of the sacrament of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme the grace of faith is infused and powred in to the soule of him or her that is baptised, and so they haue the habyte or theologicall vertue of fayth, or the thing by which afterwarde as they increase in the vse of reason, they may beleue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually

And I trust you haue now herd sufficiently of the new birthe that saynte Peter speaketh of, which is more to be pondred then the carnall byrth by corrubtible matter, for the sede &amp; cause of this generation is vncorruptible, it is the worde of God that abideth for euer, therfore consideringe whereof we came and be gotten to life and to God, we ought to haue special cleane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in our life, and to chastice oure soules vnder obedient charitie, and in fraternall loue <hi>attentius</hi> more earnestly then we haue don, and more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidering the nobilitie of thys our second byrthe, by the vncorruptible seede of Gods holye worde that abideth for euer, and hath bene prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched among vs, as saint Peter sayth in the ende of hys first chapter.

Fyrst he giueth thankes to God that hath done so moche for vs as so to get vs againe to the inheritance of heauen, that wil neuer be corrupt, that neuer wil <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> be defowled, nor fade or wither away, and in the meane season will bring vs to the soule healthe by Christes faith, that al the old prophets labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to see and to obteine, but thei were answered that it would not be for theyr time, but all the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours that they tooke in prayers, contemplacion and study, should serue for them that shuld come after, which be wee that haue sene and heard the trouthe by theym that haue preached Christes gospel continually, sithe the holye Gost was sent from heauen in sensible signes of fyrye tounges, sone after Christes gloryous ascention. And for this consideration sainte Peter exhorteth vs to be cleane of lyuinge, and while we be here to liue in feare, considering the indifferencye of our
<pb n="cxlv" facs="tcp:12050:164"/>
iudge in whom is no partialitie. And knowynge <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the price that was paide for vs, whyche was no corruptible metall, as gold or siluer, but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious bloud of a pure Lambe our sauiour Iesus Christ, and considering that the seede by whyche we wer regenerate is not corruptible, as the sede of our parentes is, by which men be goten to die, but it is immortall, as he is immortall that it commeth of, almighty God. The sede is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable gospell by which we come to baptisme, that washeth vs from all our sinnes, where I shewed you howe necessary that sacrament is to all sexes and to all ages, as wel infants as other, that lyke as they be kylled or hurte by an other mans sinne, so they may be reuiued by other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s faith. Now consequently in this second chapiter the blessed Apostle sainte Peter intreateth of the nursing or bringing vp of them that were by the saide holy sede goten and borne to Christ, and so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to life euerlasting. This is a naturall order that saint Peter kepeth here, for naturally the byrthe goeth afore the nourishinge. And because he that hath a shrewd stomake, filled with nociue and yll humors, must first haue his stomake purged, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any meate shall do him good, therefore saint Peter like a good Phisicion for the soule, counse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs first to rid the stomaks of our soules, our hartes or consciences from all malice or wyll to hurt our neighbours. That is malice, and he that hathe suche an appetite to hurt an other man or woman, is called a malicious person, otherwyse willing to do to others, then he woulde an other

Mark their answer and theyr intent, and you shall perceyue the gile, and what gile is. This was theyr aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer: It is vnlawfull and a great offence for vs to mary our sister to a man that is vncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, but if ye will come to our religion and be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised as we be, then it shall be lawfull for vs to mary together, your men with our women, &amp; our men with your women, and so we may dwel together, and liue like frendes, and if you wil not then let vs haue our sister away, and we wyll be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> gone.

And then came in the rest of Iacobs so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> their bushmentes, and made hauoke of all that was lefte. Here you see that their pretence was good and godly, but theyr intent was noughte, &amp; this is <hi>dolus,</hi> gile. If there haue been anye suche gyle vsed by faire promisses and large offers to traine ani man or woman to be of sinister or false opinion or heresie to kill his soule, vnder the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence or colour of euangelicall truthe or libertye, this muste be left and layde downe as saint Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter saith here: The sutteltie and gile that is vsed in vttering of your wares by suche wiles as you vse, for the colourable setting furth of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, must be left and layde downe, and no more vsed.

Such gile <hi>Iosue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> viii.</hi> vsed against the towne of <hi>Hay,</hi> where his host were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> put to rebuke, dryuen backe, and loste. xxxvi: men. <hi>Iosue. vii.</hi> At the second saute he set a strong bende of men to the nomber of fyue thousand in a stale at the West side of the towne of <hi>Hay.</hi> And then the captaine with his armie shewed freshlye against the towne, as thoughe they woulde haue fought with them. The kinge there encouraged by the victorie at the former skirmige, aduanced furth boldly against Iosue the captaine. And Io<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sue reculed backe and ranne awaye, as the other company had done afore, and when by his recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling he had slocked the kinge of Hay a great wai out of the town, he gaue a signe to them that lay

This was <hi>bonus dolus</hi> a laudable gile, to vanquish and ouercome Gods enemies, which had discomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them afore. You must also lay away and put from you all simulacion or faining, shewing one thing for an other, hauing one thing in the mouth and an other thing closed within the hart, as Io<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ab did to Amasa. <hi>ii. Reg. xx.</hi> suspecting that Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa would haue put him out of fauoure with the kinge <hi>Dauid</hi> when he met wyth hym, he came lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingly to him and said. <hi>Salue mi frater,</hi> God spede you or God saue you my brother, and with hys <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> right hand he toke Amasa by the chin, as though he woulde haue kissed him, but with his left ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d he drew his dagger and strake him in the syde, so that his guts fel about his feete, &amp; there he died.

There is also an other simulation which may be called good and lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and suche vsed kinge Dauid as it is wrytten <hi>i. Reg. xxi.</hi> when he fled to Achis kynge of Geth, when the kynges seruauntes sawe Dauid, they

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> sayd among them selues: is not this Dauid king of the land of Israell? Dauid was sore afrayde, and when he came afore Achis the king, he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his countenance, and fell down among their handes, and then flapped his handes, and layde his shoulders against the doores, &amp; his spytle dra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueled downe vpon his beard. Then sayde Achis to his seruants: why haue you brought this mad man afore me? haue we not mad men inoughe of our owne? Why haue ye brought this felowe to play the mad man in my presence? And vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thys Dauid was let go like a foole, and so escaped the danger of them that would haue brought him a gaine to king Saul, which then was his mortall enemye. And to this fact of Dauid agreeth full well thys comon prouerbe: <hi>Stultitiam simulare lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co prudentia summa est,</hi> To fayne foolishnesse in some case, is verye highe wisedome. Thys is not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the pernicious simulation, by whiche men wyth flyring cheare woulde crepe into a mans bosome and yet kyll hym if they coulde. And so muste all enuye be layde awaye, that is sorowe for an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers mans wealthe or welfare, or gladnesse for hys hurte or hynderance.

Thys is that dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelish vice, that is not so meete for anye place as for hell. In heauen it cannot be, for there shall be the greatest ioye possible of one neyghbour in an

And of thys shall come no ioye to the enuyous soule, but all freatyng and gnawyng in his own conscience, and euerye one of theym that there shall be against an other. It is the sinne that is most contrarye to charitie, and by that moste dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasaunt to almightye God, and moste accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and pleasant to the dyuell.

and that we shulde be as holy preistes, offeringe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> spirituall sacrifices, that maye be acceptable to God, by our Sauioure Iesus Christe. In these wordes be manye thinges to be noted and to be declared: Fyrst that our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>minge to Christe, as S. Peter here meaneth, is not to come to him on fote, nor on horsebacke, but we muste come to hym by faith, fourmed and adourned with cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and with charitable workes, by whiche they that sometime were farre of, be made nighe in the bloude of Christe. And so came Englande to Christ, not saylinge ouer the sea, nor by pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grination to the holy lande where Christe was bodely conuersaunte for the tyme, but by fyrme and faste fayth on Christe, that they conceaued by hearynge the preachers that GOD sente a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge them. And so the people of <hi>Pontus, Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, Capadotia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</hi> that Sainte Peter wryteth this letter vnto, by fayth and charitie came to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Christes grace, by which they dwelled in Christ, and Christe in them. Christe is here called a lyuinge stone, by whiche you maye playnely see, that the stone here, is not the stone that we treade on, nor the stone that you see in the pyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers or walles of the churche, for they be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyue nor lyuinge stones, but this is a maner of speaking by a methaphor or a similitude, for of all partes of the earth the stone is the fastest and the sureste to buylde on: softe earth, sande, or cleye, wyll be sone wasshed awaye with floudes or stremes, and the buyldinge sone shaken with winde or stormes, but that buyldinge that is
<pb n="clv" facs="tcp:12050:174"/>
well set on the harde rocke, standeth faste and shrynketh not for any violence. For this proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of the stone, our Sauiour Christe is called a stone, as well here as in manye other places of Scripture. This stone (sayth Sainte Peter) was reproued, despysed, and noughte set by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge men, but it was chosen of God, and set in honour, alludinge to the wordes of the Prophet Dauid. <hi>Psal. Cxvii. Lapidem quem reprobauerunt edificantes hic factus est in caput anguli.</hi> And also to the sayinge of the Prophete Esaye. <hi>Ecce po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam in Sion lapidem summum angularem proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum electum preciosum.</hi> And because Saint Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter toucheth and speaketh fyrste of the reproche of this stone, accordinge to the wordes of the Psalme, and afterwarde of his exaltation and honour, according to the wordes of Esay, I wil <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> kepe the same ordre and processe in my declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Because that the misticall senses and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandinge of the Scriptures, whether it be morall sence, allegory or anagogicall sence, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposeth a true literall sence on whiche they be grounded. Therefore because that the Prophets in theyr writinges, and also the Euangelistes in the Gospels, and also the Apostles Saint Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Saint Paule in theyr epistles, &amp; Luke in the Actes of the Apostles, hath manye tymes in mynde this verse of the Psalme, <hi>Lapidem quem reprobauerunt edificantes, hic factus est in caput anguli.</hi> The stone whiche the buylders re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued and cast by, it was made the heade stone in a corner of the buyldynge. Was there anye
<pb facs="tcp:12050:175"/>
suche stone in dede so set at nought, and caste by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> in the buyldinge of Salamons temple, or in kinge Dauids palace in Sion, or in anye suche other notable buyldinge spoken of in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? Surely I thinke noo, there was none suche a stone, albeit the Hebrewes hath an olde tale, that when kinge Dauid was well minded to buylde a temple for God to be honoured in, and was aunswered that he shoulde not do that dede, because he was a bloude sheder, and hadde done manye battels, but that his sonne Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon shoulde do it, for he shoulde be a quiet man, and a man of peace, and at reste and peace with all nations. The sayd king Dauid prepared mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ney, stones, and tymbre sufficiente for the sayde buyldynges, and squared them, and polysshed them, and trimmed them accordingely, so that his sonne shoulde lacke nothinge for that char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> edifice and buyldinges, all this is true. Then say they moreouer, that amonge the sayde stones that kynge Dauid had prouided, he sawe by reuelation one stone that would neuer be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, set or layd hansomly in any place, and that therfore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> builders wold cast it by, &amp; set nought by it, &amp; yet at the last it should haue a place at one corner in the toppe and highest part of the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, there to be the very bond and keye stone to ioyne two walles together as one wal, &amp; so they saye, it was at the consu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mation &amp; ending of the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple that Salamon builded. And of this reuelation they say, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophet had occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to say, <hi>Lapide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reprobauerunt edificantes, hic factus est in caput an

Now sayth Christ, what wyl the sayd goodman the owner of the vyneyarde do to these fermers and labourers in the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yarde that haue done this mischiefe? They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered: The yl and noughty wretches he muste destroy &amp; put them to death, &amp; must set forth his vineyarde to other tenauntes.

of the psalme, makinge for his purpose, sayinge: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> dyd you neuer reade: The stone whiche the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders reproued and caste by, was made the heade stone for the corner of the buyldinge? meaninge that the goodmannes sonne that was caste out of the vineyarde to be slayne, and the stone that the buylders reproued and caste by for noughte, was all one. He was the onely and derest sonne of the father of heauen, whome the vnkind Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes cast oute of the citie of Ierusalem, and led him to the mount of Caluary, the place of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without the citie, and there killed him, and euen he was the stone that the buylders cast by, and despised for a thinge of noughte, and yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde the same stone ioyned the two walles together as one wall, the Iewes and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyles, in the vnitie of one churche: The buylders that be here spoken of, were the scribes and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> phariseis, and learned men amonge the Iewes, whiche knewe by the Scriptures that they had redde, that Christ was the verye <hi>anoynted,</hi> that was so longe afore promised of almightie God, by the mouthes of his holy Prophetes, for they sawe all thinges that were spoken of afore, to be performed in the <hi>anointed</hi> that they loked for, performed in Christ in very dede. They saw the time that Iacob in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blessing of his so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne Iudas apointed, &amp; also Daniel the prophet spoke of to agre, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> put in effect &amp; come in dede, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> holy one of al holy ones shuld come, ther shuld be no more kinges anointed of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> linage of Iude.

They sawe also his wonderous workes and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> aboue the power of anye pure man to do. Their learnynge and the experience that they had of Christes Godlye power, and of hys wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome shoulde haue moued them to edify the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the fayth of Christe, they should haue bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued on hym them selfe, and should haue perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the people likewise to beleue vpon hym, and to take hym for the true Messias, but they did cleane contrarye, peruertynge and misexpoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng the scriptures that speake of him, and swa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge the people that he was but a dissembler, and that he was a tauerne hunter, a wyne drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, a quaffer, a companion wyth the Publicans wyth whores &amp; naughty liuers. Like as a buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der gathereth and ioyneth together stones and other matter or stuffe to make a house, euen so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> shoulde they haue gathered and layed in frame together the textes of Moyses and of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes, and suche other Scriptures of the olde Testament, appliynge them to Christ, of whom and by whome they were intended and spoken, that they so doyng, myght haue buylded the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as spiritual houses on Christ, as on the firme and sure rocke or stone. Whiche they did not, but rather dissipate and scattered abroade the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge, deuidynge the people into scismes and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers opinions of hym, and rather not to be sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisshed on hym, but to be cleane shaken awaye from hym. The blessed apostles, Euangelistes, and holye doctours gathered together the texts and saiynges of the holy scriptures as stones or
<pb facs="tcp:12050:177"/>
timber or stuffe to make vp their audience, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> buylde theim as spirituall houses on Christe. And so dothe Sainte Peter in this his letter that we haue now in hande by the aucthoritie of Dauid and Esay, declarynge Christe to be the precious and best beloued stone that GOD had chosen, althoughe men hadde reproued him, and set little by hym, whiche yet notwythstandynge he shoulde be the hedstone to ioyne together the Iewes and Gentyles in one churche. And not onelye then he was reproued of the builders of that tyme, the Scribes and Phariseis and their audiences and Scholers the carnall Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, but as well nowe adayes he is reiecte and dispised of manye Buylders and Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, blasphemynge and missaiynge hys god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye and myghtye power in manye pointes, as farre foorthe as they dare, for feare of the Kinges lawes. And of this it commeth that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> so manye miscreauntes and misbeleuers so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle regarde the blessed and mooste reuerende Sacramente of the Aultare, and also the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall confession of synnes vnto a Prieste, as thoughe Christe were not able by his Godlye power to make of breade and wine, his owne fleshe and bloude, and to geue power to a priest by his wordes to dooe the same likewise, Or as thoughe GOD were not able by his officer to deliuer men from the prison and bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dage of their synnes. They that by their preachynge, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge, or teachinge, sowe suche heresies among the people, they be naughtye builders, they cast
<pb n="clviii" facs="tcp:12050:177"/>
away the bindinge stone our Sauiour Christe, that he maie not ioyne together all people in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> vnitie of one faieth, they scatter the stones, the aucthorities of the scriptures by their misunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standinge, and false interpretation, more then gathereth theim to edifie and builde their audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on the liuelye and liuynge stone oure Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ.

The Iewes were offended and thought amisse of Christe because they sawe him in the infirmitie of his flesh. They sawe him eat and drinke, slepe, and laboure as other men did. They knewe his bryngynge vp in youthe, and where he was nursed, and who was his mother &amp; who were his kinsfolkes. This made a great meyny of them to shake him of, and in no wise to beleue vppon him, and by that this stone fell vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, &amp; al to crasshed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to naught. <hi>Quia super quem ceciderit lapis iste conteret enim.

the Gospels reherseth of hym likewyse. I thinke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> it necessarye to demore and tarye in the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that maner of speakynge of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and what is meaned by the same. <hi>Luke. ii.</hi> It is written that when Christes foster father, and Mary his mother presented him in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as the lawe was. The holye and well dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed man Symeon toke hym in hys armes with great ioye, because he knew it was he that shold be the consolation and comforte of Israell. And he knewe the tyme was then come, or very neare hande, when Christe shoulde come. He knewe it also by reuelation of the holye Gooste that then moued hym to goe to the Temple, as it is there sayde. <hi>Et venit in spiritu in templum.</hi> Where after great ioye of that he hadde seene, he then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> desiered to be let go in peace, to dye. And among other thinges, he saide this plainely to Marye the blessed Mayde and mother of Christe, as a cordiall, or rather a corosiue. <hi>Ecce positus est hic in ruinam &amp; in resurrectionem multorum in Israel, &amp; insignum cui contradiceretur, Et tuam ipsius ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam pertransibit gladius.</hi> Loe (sayeth he.)

And as for your part (said he) to Marie his mother, the sworde of sorowe shall pearce your harte, which yet shall redound and turne to the comfort of manye others.

And. <hi>Mat. xi.</hi> When sainte Iohn Baptist sente two of his disciples to Christe to aske him a question for their learnynge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was he that they loked for, that aboute that time they knew shoulde come to saue man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, or whether they should loke for another? Because they shoulde not saye as the Iewes were euer ready and wonte to saye. <hi>Tu de te ipso testimonium dicis, testimonium tuum non est veru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Thou bearest witnesse of thy selfe, thy witnesse is not true.

In whiche wordes Christe touched the messengers and manye others by them. They sawe hym a mortall man as other were, they could scarce beleue any Godhed in him, yet seinge that Christ knewe their wan and fainte beleue, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes of their hartes, this made them to haue more affiance &amp; beleue vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, for it is aboue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knowlege of a pure ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to knowe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> secretes of an other mans minde.

And not onely these messengers of sainte Iohn, but also manie a thousand others be offended by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Christe, and by Christes woordes euerye daye. Because men see not the bloud runne about the Priestes fingers in the masse at the fractions of the Sacrament, they be so harde harted, and so dul in beleue, that thei wil not beleue that Christ saide, true when he saide, this is my bodye, or my fleshe and bloude in the sacrament of the aultare because thei perceiue not by it as they do bi other fleshe and bloud in the Shambles, not beleuing that Christe by his Godlye power causeth and maketh his owne fleshe and bloud there secrete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye vnder the fourme of breade and wyne for to augment and encreace the merite of our fayeth, which shold be smal or none, if we saw that with our bodelye eyes that wee see by the fayethfull <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> eyes of our christen hartes.

And euen so they iudge by sacramentall confession of sinnes, thinkynge men no more bounde nowe to be confessed, nother anye otherwyse then to God, because that afore christes time when the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of penaunce was not instituted nor ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it was inough to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessed to god. But now that Christ hath appointed an other maner, som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more paineful, men can skant be euen with Christe, nor contente wyth hym. But haue recourse backewarde, reculynge to the Iewes custome, and forsake the way that Christe hath

ordeyned to remitte sinnes by penaunce, whiche <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> is the onely and necessarye waye to be saued for them that after the sinceritye of baptisme hathe fallen to sinne againe. if they shall haue oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie to come to it. They that wyll not submit them selues to penaunce, so ofte hearinge the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacity of that Sacrament, shal be conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned by the wordes of Christe, <hi>Mat. xii. Viri Niniuite surge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in iudicio cum generatione ista &amp; conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nabunt eam quia penitentiam egerunt in predicatione Ione.</hi> The people of the greate Citye of Niniue were greatlye geuen to carnall pleasures, and to vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liuynge. Wherefore they were threatened that within forty dayes their citye shoulde bee ouerturned and destroyed, yet by the preachynge of Ionas the prophet they did penaunce in sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clothe, in clothe of heare and asshes, and fasted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> both man and beaste, as well the kinge and the nobilitie, as the common people. In contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion wherof God was mercifull, and turned hys sentence of destruction into mercye and saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. They did frutefull penaunce after their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and christen folke despise to do penaunce as is prescribed and taught them, and therfore the Niniuites shall condemne the christen folkes at the daye of iudgement, and shall appeare more iust afore God, then christen people shal that wil do no penaunce as they be taught to do. Thus Christ sayth, but very fewe attendeth to his sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge, or beleueth it, and whye? Because they be sclaundered or offended by Christe. Men see not Christe take the noughty liuers and destroy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And because Christe forbeareth them tyll then, they care for no more, they care not what they dooe. They will beleue no more then they see lyke as dull and brute beastes. And they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde not to come vnto Sermons to heare the worde of GOD declared, whereby they might learne to beleue that they see not. And therefore the <hi>quene of Saba</hi> in the south parte of the world shall rise in iudgement and shall condemne you. <hi>Math xii.</hi> For she came euen from the fardest and best parte of luckye and frutefull Arabie, liynge <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> on the meridionall Ocean in the vttermost part of the worlde vnto Hierusalem to heare the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and wise wordes of Salomon. And hee whose wordes you maye heare at Sermons, is muche greater, and much wyser then euer was Salomon. It is almightye God and his incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate wisdome, his onely begotten sonne our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Iesus Christe, whose wordes farre passe the wisedome of Salomon.

Therfore at the terrible day of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> dome she shall be praised for her diligence, where christen people shall be conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned for their slouth and negligence. At Sermons (I saye) you shall be taught to beleue that you see not, as Sainte Iohns disciples (of whiche I spoke euen nowe) were taughte by the checke that Christe gaue them, saiynge: <hi>Blessed is he that is not offended by me.</hi> By whiche they perceiued that Christe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by them that they were offended by him, not beleuyng any Godheade or Godlye power to be in hym, because they considered no more but the infirmitie of the fleshe, whiche they sawe in hym as in other menne, but then perceiuinge that he knewe their thoughts, this made them the more inwardely and earnestlye to consider the myra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and marueilous workes to whiche he refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them, and by that to take hym as one farre aboue a pure man accordyng to saint Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tistes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> expectation, for he sente them to Christ (as I saied afore) to aske a question for their owne learnynge, and not for his. For he doubted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge what Christe was, nor of his power. And men that now a dayes geueth little credence to the commination and threatenyng that GOD geueth to the synneful people by the mouthes of his preachers, beinge offended and takynge oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of ruine, and occasion of their hardnesse of harte in not beleuynge, by Goddes longanimitie and longe sufferaunce, because they see not the stroke of God fal by and by, in that folowing the obstinacie of the olde Iewes, for euen so it was in old tyme.

Saint Augustine deuiseth this edifice of Christes church, on Christ and on his apostles nobly well, saiyng: that when the foundation is layed here on earth, the walles be builded vppon it, and the weyght of the walles presseth and weyeth downewarde, because the foundation is beneath alowe, but in asmuch as our foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is in heauen, we muste be builded vpwarde to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde heauen, and thitherwarde we muste wey <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and runne, because we must folowe the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and leyne on the foundation.

            <head>¶ The seuenth treatise or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> sermon.</head>
            <p>THe blessed Apostle Saint Peter prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth this spiritual buylding that I spoke of in thend of my last sermon, saying that we muste be buylded on this stone our sauiour Christ <hi>as an holy priesthoode, offering spirituall sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices acceptable to God by Iesus Christ.</hi> Occasion of this saying saint Peter toke of the saying of al mighty God by Moyses, to the people of Israel <hi>Exod. xix. If you will heare my voice, and wil kepe my commaundement, you shall be my peculier and speciall people of all people: all the world is myne, et vos eritis mihi in rengnu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sacerd otale et gens sancta ta. And I wyll haue you a priestly kingdome and an holy nation.</hi> Alluding to this Saint Peter wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth here <hi>Vos autem genus electum regale sacerdo cium gens sancta populus acquisitionis.</hi> You be a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> chosen kinred, a princely or a kingly priesthod, an holy nacion, a people that are wonne. Thys text cannot be negligentlye passed ouer, but muste be earnestly loked on, speciallye because that at this text manye men stumble and hurt them selues, takinge occasion of heresie. Of this saying of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God in Exodo, and the rehersall of saynt Peter of the same text here in this place, thei wil proue (if they maye) that all men and women be priestes as well as they that be ordered by a by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops hands, because that saint Peter writ these wordes to all them that he had preached vnto, &amp; by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vs and to all other that shal come after
<pb facs="tcp:12050:185"/>
till the worldes ende, as wel to women as to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of all degres, and of all ages that were baptised and had taken vpon them Christes lyuerye. All such saint Peter calleth <hi>regale sacerdotium,</hi> kings and priestes: and to confirme theyr opinion they alledge the saying of saint Iohn in the first chap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter of the Apocalips, wher he speaketh of Christ, saying: <hi>Qui dilexit nos, &amp; lauit nosa peccatis nostris in sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guine suo et fecit nos regnum et sacerdotes deo et parrisuo.</hi> He loued vs and washed vs from our sinnes in his bloode, and made vs a kingdome &amp; priests to God and to his father. Of these autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities the Lutherians take an argument and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to confounde and deface all good order of diuine and humane thinges, allowing the wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to serue the altar, and to say masse while the men <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> tary at home, and keepe the children and washe theyr ragges and clothes: and aswell they might allow the women to be captains of their warres and to leade and gide an army of men in battell, while theyr husbandes tary at home to mylk the Cowe, and to serue the Sow, and to spynne and carde. To exchewe suche horrible confusion and misordring of the worlde that would offende ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest eares to heare it, and to declare that if they well vnderstoode the textes alledged, they should finde none occasion of such errour. We must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the sayd texts, and waigh the sayings of almighty God by Moyses, to the people of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, and the sayinges of S. Peter and saint Iohn, so that we may conserue and keepe that ordinate I herarchie and good order amonge people, that
<pb n="clxvi" facs="tcp:12050:185"/>
God would haue vs to kepe, and that al the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and the Apostles letters be full of. Saynt Ambrose in his first booke <hi>de vocatione gentium, cap. iii.</hi> giueth vs a very notable rule to expounde scriptures, and it is the same rule in effecte that Tichonius putteth for the thirde rule whiche he called <hi>de specie et genere,</hi> as S. Austine writeth <hi>iii. de doctrina Christiana.</hi> Saint Ambrose rule is this: In scripture many times that thing is said and spoken vniuersally of the whole, which is ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rified and true onely of the part. He putteth ther many examples, of whiche some I will reherse, leauing the other for to auoyde prolixitie and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diousnes. The prophet saith in the psalme: <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uat dominus omnes qui corruunt et erigit omnes eli <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> sos,</hi> Our Lord God taketh vp all them that fall, and setteth vp al them that be broken or brused. By this texte it seemeth that who soeuer falleth to sinne, God setteth him vp agayne, or if he be broken against the stone, (that I spoke of afore) by sinne God setteth hym on his feete agayne, whiche if it myght be so vnderstande and founde true, then shoulde neuer manne nor woman be dampned, and then it myghte seeme true that I sayde of the mockers of Gods woorde that they hadde made a leege with death, and a couenaunt with hell, that neyther death nor hell should hurt theym. And oure Sauiour saythe in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: <hi>Si exaltatus fuero a terra omnia traham ad me ipsum.</hi> As thoughe he promysed that when he was crucifyed, he woulde conuert and drawe
<pb facs="tcp:12050:186"/>
to him all men and women of the world whiche <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> is not yet performed, but many persist and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in infidelitie. And likewise in the negatiues it is written in the psalme: <hi>Dominus de celo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spexit super filios hominum vt videat si est intellige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s aut requirens deum, omnes declinauerunt simul inu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles facti sunt no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> est qui faciat bonu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, non est vsque ad vnu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Psa. xiii.</hi> Our lord loked down fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the children of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to se whither ther wer euer a wyse one, or one that sought for god, al be wried away, they be al together vnprofitable, without fruite of good workes. There is none that doth any good, no not so much as one. Likewise saith the Apostle. <hi>Phil. ii. omnes que sua sunt querunt non que Iesu Christi.</hi> All men seeke for theyr own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, and not those thynges that be for Christes pleasure. Here be hard sayinges if they be not hel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ped bi the rule that saint Ambrose teacheth vs to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber when we expound scriptures. The rule <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> is this: The scripture speaketh manye tymes of the whole meaninge, but the part of the same, as speaking of the whole world meaneth but parte of the same, and speaking of al men, meaneth but part of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Or as the Logicion speaketh in such sayinges of the scriptures, there maye be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand <hi>distributio pro generibus singulorum, no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pro singulis generum, vel econuerso.</hi> As when the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet sayde: <hi>that God taketh vp to him all that fall downe.</hi> For of all them that falleth, he taketh vp some, and leaueth the other in their filth &amp; myre. And when Christ said that when he should be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted on the crosse, he would drawe all the men &amp;
<pb n="clxvii" facs="tcp:12050:186"/>
women of the world vnto him, for in deede of all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> partes of the worlde some he drewe vnto hym. Likewise the prophet said: all be wryed awaye, because that aswel of the Iewes as of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils a great meany declined to idolatry and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vices, so that among suche as declined and wryed away, there was scant one founde good &amp; profitable, that woulde conuert and turne again Where Saint Paul saith that al seke their own profit, and no man seketh for that Christ woulde haue theym to seke for, surelye true it is that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all men a great manye there be suche, and euen so (saithe sainte Ambrose) we must vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande the saying of Sainte Peter that we haue now in hande, taken of the sayinge of almightye God by Moyses to the people of Israel, <hi>you be a chosen kinred, kynges and priestes,</hi> the whole for the part, for of the multitude of Christen people there were and be kinges, and of that multitude should be elect and made priestes, and not that al <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the multitude that saint Peter or Saynte Iohn wryt vnto men and women were all and euerye one of them priestes, no more then they were all kinges, and yet they be equally called aswell kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as priestes. Were they all electe and chosen? were they all holy? were they all wone and goten as a vauntage to God, to preach and declare the vertue and power of God that called them from darkenes vnto his marueilous lighte of grace &amp; of his holy gospel? Al this Saint Peter here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth of them that he called kynges and prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes, and yet a great multitude of theym, &amp; after
<pb facs="tcp:12050:187"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> vntill our time, and now in our time (God know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth) sheweth litle that thei be called to that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous and marueilous light, but rather choseth to lye in blinde darknes, and be gladder to heare and learne suche lewde and foolish playes &amp; leud lessons as may kepe them still in theyr blindnes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Qui aliqua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> populus dei, nunc autem populus dei qui non consecuti misericordiam, nunc autem mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sericordiam consecuti.</hi> To them saint Peter sayth here, that some time they were not Gods people, but now they be Gods people, which is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand of part of them, &amp; not of the whole nom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber. And so is the other saying to be vnderstand that where sometime they lacked Gods mercye, now they haue gotten gods mercy, which in dede the election or they that God knew for his owne hathe gotten, where they that be reprobate and naughty and vicious hath it not. In like maner <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> we say that <hi>tribus Iuda,</hi> was <hi>tribus regia.</hi> The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily or house of Iuda, was the house of kynges amonge the people of Israell, yet they of that house were not al kinges, although the kings of Ierusalem were of that house euer after Saule tyll Herode the first vsurped, comminge in by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusion by the power of the Emperour of Rome. We say also that <hi>tribus Leui erat tribus sacerdota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> the family, house, or issue of Leui was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> house of pristes, for ther shuld none be prestes by Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses law, but onely of that tribe, yet for al this say<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing, which is true, they were not all priestes that were of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tribe or kinred although they were al ministers in the temple in some office hygher or
<pb n="clxviii" facs="tcp:12050:187"/>
lower in the same. Euen so the Apostle calleth vs kynges and priestes, for of Christen people there be, and hath be, and shalbe some kinges and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> some priests, for if a man woulde egerly and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly by these textes of the Apostles, proue all Christen people to be priests, he must by the same graunt that al Christen men and women be kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which a madman woulde not saye, and so he shoulde be worse then mad, excepte they woulde transferre the name of kinges to a spirituall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, calling theym kinges that can rule their owne passions, affections, and sensual appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, which to do is a princely poynt, and a part of a noble man. <hi>Prouer. xvi. Melior est patiens viro forti &amp; qui dominatur animo suo expugnatore vrbiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> Better is the pacient man, then he that is strong of bodye: and he that ruleth his own wil, is more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to be esteemed, then he that conquereth townes and countreys. For the conquest of townes and countreys is outfurth, the other is inward, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a mannes harte ouercommeth it selfe, and subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth hym selfe vnto hym selfe, whyche the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours commonlye do not, but rather be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of theyr owne concupiscence, ambition and couetuousnesse. Well, if ye wyll take kynges in suche a spirituall signification, then I praye you be content to take the name of a prieste in a lyke spirituall sygnifycation, and so let vs call all theym priestes that be the spiritual members of the hyghe Priest oure Sauioure Iesus Christe by parte takynge of hys priesthoode.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:12050:188"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> And then like as they that be spiritually kyngs, be not kinges anoynted with materiall oyle, for the office of a king, as all kinges were by the old law, and also be now adayes in the time of grace neither hath like authoritie, might, and power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer realmes and countries, as such kynges hath. Euen so you must vnderstand of the mistical and spiritual priestes, and theyr priesthode, that it is not of such authoritie, efficacitie and strength, as is the priesthoode of them that by materiall oyle and imposicion of the bishoppes hands be conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate and made priestes for suche offyces as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God by his scriptures hathe assigned to them, of which I shall speake anon. This spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall priesthode is no more but our baptisme, or Christendome, in whyche we be anoynted with that oyle of gladnes the holye Gost, gyuen vs at our baptisme, which Christe had <hi>pre consortibus <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> suis</hi> afore and aboue all vs his coparteners. And of his plenty of that grace of the holye Goste we take our part after suche measure as it pleaseth him to distribute vnto vs. And after this maner saynt Peter here wylleth vs to be builded on the lyuing stone <hi>as spirituall houses, and as a holy prest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode offering spirituall sacrifices acceptable to god by Iesus Christ.</hi> And this priesthode is common to all men, as well lay men as priestes.

               </hi> the lay priesthod indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to all men and women that be christned, &amp; theyr spiritual sacrifices that they offer be proporcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to theyr presthod as the sacrifice of iustice,
<pb n="clxix" facs="tcp:12050:188"/>
the sacrifice of <hi>laude and praise of god,</hi> the sacrifice <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of prayer and such other, as be common to al ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of good men and women: And such as saynt Paule <hi>Rom. xii.</hi> prayeth euery person to offer to God, saying: <hi>obsecro vos per misericordia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dei vt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibeatis corpora vestra hostiam sanctam viuentem deo placentem.</hi> I pray you for the mercye of God, that you giue your bodies as an holye hoste, as a liuing sacrifice pleasant to almighty God by our sauiour Iesus Christ. These be the spiritual ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes that saynt Peter speaketh of here, and these be euery man and womans sacrifices that wyll shewe them selues to be of Christes faith and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, and these be made acceptable to God by the merites of our sauiour Iesus Christe, on whom we beleue. By this you may iudge how far wide from this generall laye presthoode, and from the sinceritie of theyr Christendome they be that wil neither sacrifice to God <hi>iustice</hi> or rightuous dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> but vseth al oppression, extorcion, theft and bribery, neither will giue to God the sacrifice of <hi>laude,</hi> praise, and thankes, but rather blasphemy to Gods reproche, and to his dispite, and wil not vse prayers in the church nor in other places, but rather with their babling in the church, and moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of diuine seruice letteth and hindreth other men from theyr praiers, and from attending and hearing gods seruice. They giue not theyr bodies as a holy sacrifice to God, but rather as a stinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king sacrifice to the fleshe &amp; to the diuel, not liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but sinfull and deadly, not pleasant, but as an instrument of mischiefe, displeasant to God and

There is an other priesthode whiche is one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of the seuen sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, called the order of prest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hode, farre aboue the foresayd lay priesthoode in dignitie and in authoritie.

I beseche you (sayth he) as Straungers and Pyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimes to kepe your selues from carnall desyres which fight against the soule. This obsecration or beseching signifieth a certayne vehemencie in desiring as it wer for Gods sake, or for the loue of our Lady, or of al the sayntes of heauen, or for their faithes sake, by which thei trusted to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,

Carnall desires he calleth them or fleshely lustes, and biddeth vs abstayne from them, because they fight agaynst the soule. The flesh desireth ease, the flesh desireth new knacks with chaunge of pleasures. The fleshe desireth swetenes of tastynge and of touchynge. By the fleshe I meane carnal men and women geuen to folowe the inclination of the bodye.

crabbed, croked, and cumberous. Some readeth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> it <hi>difficilioribus,</hi> to hard, sore and cruell. So that this is the Apostles minde, that what condition so euer your maisters be of, you muste do youre duety and true seruice vnto them. Seruitude co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>meth either of iniquitie or of aduersitie: Of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie came the bondage that Cham was cursed withal, because he mocked his father lying bare, he had his fathers curse. <hi>Maledictus Chanaan pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er seruus seruorum erit fratribus suis.</hi> He cursed Cham in his chylde and issue, with perpetuall bondage.

Then how may I do this faulte and synne agaynst my lord? Fye for shame hold me excused, I will not do it. If his maister had ben his father he coulde not haue expressed more louinge feare toward him, by this geuing example to al seruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes to loue theyr maisters, and to feare them, and not onelye with feare of mynde, but also that the feare that is in theyr hearte shulde extende into the body, whiche S.

Albeit this quaking feare accor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth properly to the bondman that doth al thing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> for feare of strokes. And S. Peter speaketh ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally of al maner of fear, saying: <hi>in omni timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> so that the seruaunt should cheifely feare his maister louinglye, as the chylde the father, and if at the fyrst he haue not suche louinge feare of his mayster, yet beware of his angre, feare correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the bondman or prentise doth, &amp; by vsing thy self to do wel for suche seruile feare, thou shalte find ease in wel doing, &amp; shal begin to do well for loue, &amp; so of a good seruaunt thou shalt be made a good sonne, faithfull and louing to thy maister, and by that thy maister shall loue the better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any child he hath. <hi>Prou.

If his master bidde him take ordres and be a preist, is the seruaunt bound to obey his mayster? if his maister bidde him take a wife and be maried, is the seruaunt bound to obey him in these cases, or in suche other? No verelye: for where S. Paule or S.

In these wordes he geueth them spirituall and goostly counsayle, and comforte saying: This is a speciall gyfte of grace of the holy gooste, if anye of you suffer so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe and payne wrongfully, <hi>propter conscienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Dei,</hi> hauing in his conscience a respect to the pleasure of God, which would not the seruaunt to grudge against his maister, and also remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the reward that God will geue to al them that for his sake suffreth more then els thei were bound to suffre. S. Paule sayth. <hi>Phil. i. Vobis do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natum est pro Christo non solum vt in eum credatis sed ut etiam pro illo paciamini.</hi> It is geuen you for

We se also by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that heate causeth and maketh boldnes in man and beaste, therefore the beastes that haue hootest hartes be moost bold, and for this cause the lion is bolder then is the horse or an oxe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his harte hath in it a more feruente heate then the other haue in theyr hartes.

of Ioseph that I spoke of afore, he was true to his maister, he runne away and fled for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> he was falselye accused and vniustlye condempned and cast in pryson, and layde faste in yrons, all this he toke pacientlye, and suffered very soberly and humblye, and therefore his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde was very greate and notable. Fyrst God sente him a grace in his fashion and behauioure by whiche he pleased the iayler and keper of the pryson, in so muche that he stroke of his yrons, and made him ouersear and ruler ouer all the prysoners there, and to geue them theyr meate that they were allowed at tymes conueniente.

            <p>THe blessed Apostle Saynt Peter in this matter that I haue to be declared vnto you, prosecuteth further the thinge that I partelye touched in my laste sermon, whiche is of the pacient sufferaunce that the seruaunte or subiecte ought to vse towarde his maister or superiour, sayinge: <hi>In hoc enim vocati estis.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidre your callinge: GOD hath called you to serue (sayth S.

That man that wyl not learne pacience of Christ, can neuer be saued by Christ: Remembre the highnes of his estate, by whiche he was equal with his father of heauen, and then the abiection and vylenes of his passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and his paynes that he suffered without any cause geuen thereto on his behalfe, and this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce wyll make a stony hearte to molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fye and waxe tendre.

But there is neyther fauour nor feare mede nor dreade that shoulde haue made him to condempne an innocent that neuer offended the

lawes. Now how Christ committed him selfe to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Pilate, you must consider that fyrst he deliuered him selfe to Iudas comming to mete him, when he came with his companie to take Christe, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das delyuered hym to the ministers that came with Iudas to take Christe, and they delyuered him to the princes of priestes, scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seys that hadde payde money to Iudas for him: They deliuered him to Pilate which wrongful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye condempned him. This deliuerie of Christes part proceded and came of obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to his father and of most abundant charitie and loue towarde mankinde. Of Iudas part it came of couetuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to recouer the losse of the oyntment that Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry Magdalen bestowed vpon his fete anoynting them. And on the Scribes and Phariseis part it came of rancke malice and enuie against Christ. I take not <hi>prodere</hi> and <hi>tradere</hi> for one. <hi>Prodere</hi> is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to woorke the treason, and that was done when Iudas consulted with the princes of the prestes, and agreed with theim on a price, then the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son was wrought, when Christ was bought and sold. Deliueraunce was made afterwarde when Iudas mette him in the gardeine and kissed him and they sette handes on hym. Iudas was <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor</hi> and <hi>traditor,</hi> he wroughte the treason, and also made delyueraunce. <hi>Qui peccata nostra ipse pertulit in corpore suo super lignum.</hi> Euen he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyuered hym selfe to the vniuste iudge whyche bore oure synnes vppon hys bodye, nayled faste vppon the tree of the crosse. He bore our synnes vpon hys bodye (saythe Saynte Peter) not as

my surpeles beareth hys whitenesse, nor as thy gowne beareth his blackenesse, for my surpelesse beareth hys wytenesse, so that I maye saye my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> surpeles is whyte, and thy gowne beareth hys blackenesse, so that I maye saye thy gowne is blacke. But thoughe Christe bore oure synnes, I may not saye that Christ was a synner, for he neuer sinned in worde nor dede, as Saynt Peter sayde afore. When we bare our iniquitie we be wicked, when we bear our sinnes we be sinners, it is not so of Christe, therefore when we saye that Christe bore oure synnes, you muste vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande that hee bore the payne and punyshement that we were worthye to beare for oure synnes, as the Prophet Esaye sayde of hym longe afore. <hi>Esa. liii.

Peter: You were once like shepe strayed oute of Gods flocke, but nowe you be conuerted and turned againe to the pastor and feder, bishop and ouerseer of your soules. And in this processe saint Peter also semeth to teach vs the parable of the gospell of the man that had a C. sheepe, of whych one was straied away, and he left foure score and nintene in deserte, and went to seeke that sheepe that was strayed awaye, and when hee hadde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> founde her, he cast her on his shoulders, and was glad, and when he came home with her, he called his friendes and his neighbours about him, prai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>yng them to be mery with him, because he hadde founde the shepe that was lost, and so they made more chere and myrth for that one shepe, then for all the rest that still kept the flocke. Thys odde shepe that strayed out of the flocke, signifieth the tenthe kynde of reasonable creatures that God made to honour and laude hym. God made the ix. orders of Angels, al reasonable creatures, and the tenth is mankinde, which was by sinne gone at large out of the folde of Paradise, and oute of the compasse of Gods fauour. The second person
<pb n="clxxxxii" facs="tcp:12050:213"/>
in trinitie owner of this sheepe, left all the rest of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> his resonable creatures and shepe or flocke the .ix orders of Angels in deserte in heauen, which the innumerable multitude of dampned angels had forsaken and left, and so to them it was a wilder<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse, as a thinge forsaken. And so it was to man that was made finally to inherite heauen, yet fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing his pleasure regarded it not, but had lost it, and yet to this daye it is reputed as a wylder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or as a thing forsake of the most part of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that will not walke in the streyght way that bringeth a man to heauen, but had leauer keepe the brode waye of pleasure, easelye hopping and dauncing to hell, and therefore to them heauen is a wildernes, and also in the wooddes of the wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes there be many birdes that singeth swete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with many and diuers swete tunes: so in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen where the <hi>inhabitauntes shall prayse our Lorde God worlde without ende.</hi> There be also in wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes many swete and pleasant floures, and so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> there be in heauen the red roses of Martyrs, the violets of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessours, the lilies of Uirgines: For such considerations heauen may be called a wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes, as Christ calleth it in thys parable. Ther he semed to leaue them when he came alowe, and was by our mortall and passible nature <hi>minished and made somwhat lower then the Angels,</hi> though by his Godhead he were farre aboue them. Here in earth he found the shepe that was lost, and nei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther beat it nor stroke it, nor brawled with it, nor rayled nor chidde, but louingly gotte it vpon hys shoulders, when his shoulders and armes were
<pb facs="tcp:12050:214"/>
racked and strained to fet the holes that wer bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> for the nailes in the side armes of the crosse, for then (as Esay saith, and saint Peter reherseth the same here) he bare our sinnes vpon his te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der bodie on the crosse, he suffered vpon the crosse the paines that we should haue suffered for our sins. Saint Ambrose vpon the same saithe: <hi>Humeri Christi brachia crucis sunt, illic peccata mea deposui, in illa patibuli nobilis ceruice requieui.</hi> The shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Christ be they that be extended vpon the braunches of the crosse, there vpon them (said S. Ambrose) I laide downe my sinnes on the necke and shoulders of that noble galowes, I reste my selfe. But because Christ in his parable saith that the shepherd cast the sheepe vpon hys shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <hi>gaudens</hi> being glad and mery, but seyng all this concerneth his paineful passion on the crosse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> in which he suffred paines vntollerable: how can it be that he with ioye and gladnes cast his strai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed shepe vpon his shoulders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was to his payne and not to his pleasure, as it semeth. In verye dede although he bore our sinnes (that is to say, the paines for our sinnes) to his paines, ache and smarting: yet knowing what shoulde come of it, he was gladde to take the paine and to saue hys shepe. For in this you must vnderstande that the reasonable soule of Christe (comprehending both wytte and wyll) eleuate to the contemplation and fruition of almighty God, is called the supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioure &amp; hyghest parte of the soule. The same soule applyed to inferiour and lower thinges, is called the lower porcion or lower part of the soul
<pb n="clxxxxiiii" facs="tcp:12050:214"/>
As when the witte or will is applyed or inclined <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to the fiue wittes, or to theyr sensuall appetites or to other lower worldly busines, paines or plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sures, all beit when the witte or will is exercysed aboute anye suche lower matters in an order to Gods pleasure, they belong to the higher porcion and may be called the higher porcion of the soule largely or comonly speaking of the higher porci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. To our purpose, although the lower part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> soule of Christ had sorowe &amp; paine wyth the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible powers of the bodye that smarted and aked right sore with the flesh, which was most tender in Christ, because he was of most pure &amp; tender complexion. In the higher part of his soule, both wayes had euer ioy and gladnes. As for the first <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> way in the conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>placion and fruition of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, there is no doubt, for it gaue Christes soule beatitude, euen such ioy and gladnes as he hathe in heauen now. After the second maner also, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christe consydered hys paynefull passion as the meane appointed by the father to redeme mans soule, &amp; to bring home the sheepe that was lost &amp; strayed away by sinne, he toke the paines with a good will and very gladly. We haue a like exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Saint Paule, which by the higher part of his soule, and by his deliberate and well aduised will, desired to be dissolued and to be with Christ all beit the wyll vnite in amitie and loue to the sensuall appetite desyred to abyde styll in the fleshe and to lyue. In lyke maner were the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Martyrs whyche in theyr bodyes suffered vnmeasurable tormentes and greuous paynes,
<pb facs="tcp:12050:215"/>
yet remembring Gods pleasure, &amp; the rewardes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that they should haue for the same, they toke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gladly &amp; with good chere.

               <hi>gaudens</hi> with ioy and gladnes in the higher porcion of his soul, knowing that by his paines and bi his death ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shoulde be restored to fauoure agayne, that afore was attainted &amp; out of Gods fauour. And that where we were afore like straied shepe out of the blessed flocke of Gods faithfull people, nowe we be conuerted and turned agayn to the pastor and bishop of our soules, as S.

Gods ordinance that the man should be the head of the woman, as Christ is the head of his spouse and wife the church or multitude of Christen peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> therefore like as the churche is subiect, obedi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ent, and doth reuerence to Christ, as the body to her head, so ought the wyues to theyr husbands as to theyr head in all thinges that be good and according to Gods pleasure. Of the contempt of due subiection and obedience of the wyfe to the husband, I rede a notable story. <hi>Hester</hi> .i. wher it is written that the great kynge and conquerour <hi>Assuerus</hi> king of the Medes and Persies, &amp; ouer cxxvii. prouinces and realmes, made an exceding sumptuous feast to all the nobilitie and head of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of his Empery and dominions, the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and prouision for the same, with the inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacion and accesse of his gests, continued .ix. score <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> daies, the solempnitie of the feast continued .vii. daies. There was such prouision, such seruice of al officers, and such delicates of meates &amp; drinks that wonder it is to heare of it. And like as that king kept his feast in the solemne place prouided for the same: so dyd <hi>Vasthi</hi> his Quene keepe her feast, to all the quenes Ladies and noble women of the Emperye, and that in the palace where <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suerus</hi> was wont to dwell, for the kynges feaste was kepte in Haalys or tentes wonderouslye wroughte with costlye stuffe, and stronglye stai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by pyllers of fyne Marble after a gorgeous fashyon all of pleasure, there the kynge kepte hys solempne banckettes, and lefte hys palace for the Quene <hi>Vasthi</hi> wyth the other Ladyes.
<pb facs="tcp:12050:217"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> On the .vii. daye of this feast when <hi>Assuerus</hi> the king had well dronke, &amp; was well warmed with wyne, he sent his Chamberlaynes to call <hi>Vasthi</hi> the quene to him, willing her to put on her head her diademe or crowne and to come forthe after her goodliest maner, because he would shewe to his kynges and lordes the beautie of his quene, for she was very fayre and beautyfull, but she re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fused to come at him, and contempned the kinges commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, sent to her by his chamberleins, for this cause the king was sore dismaid, &amp; wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wondrous angrye, and in a rage called all the great wisemen of his priuye counsayle that were euer at hande (as the maner of kinges is to haue suche counsayle euer redy) and by theyr counsayl he did al weighty matters, because they knew the lawes of God and man: he asked theyr counsayle what sentence shoulde be gyuen againste <hi>Vasthi</hi>

of the Princes of the Persies and of the Medes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> will sette little by the commaundement of their husbandes. Wherefore the indignation and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure that your highnesse hathe conceiued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainste her is iuste and not without a cause. And therefore (if it be your pleasure) let a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation be sende frome your persone, that quene <hi>Vasthi</hi> shall neuer more come in your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, but that an other better then she shall take her raigne, that she hathe as one with you. And let the same commaundemente be diuulled and proclaymed in all Prouinces and Realmes of your Emperie, euen to the furthest parte therof, that so all wiues, as well of the great men, as of the common and lower people maye geue honor and obedience to their husbandes. This coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> pleased the Kinge and the princes that were present with him, and the kinge according to the same, sent furth his letters into all countreys of his emperye, written in diuers languages, and diuers letters, that euerye man might reade and vnderstande them, conteininge this argumente, that <hi>the men be princes and greatest in their owne houses,</hi> wherfore it foloweth that the wyues be subiecte and vnder obedience to them. By this storie all good wiues may note and marke what commeth of contempte and disobedience of the wyues to their Husbandes. She was deposed from her high estate and put away from her hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sbande, because she list not to obey nor to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to his commaundement. Almighty GOD made the first woman for two vses or purposes,
<pb facs="tcp:12050:218"/>
one for to multiplye mankinde by generation, an other cause, for domesticall cohabitation, and to dwell wyth the manne for his comforte. And in bothe these two, the woman was soore punished because shee tempted her husbande to eate of the forbidden fruite. Firste where she shoulde haue borne chylde wythout payne, she was deputed to exceadynge payne wyth manye throwes and panges while shee is wyth chylde, and wyth muche more payne when shee is traueylynge to be deliuered. Seconde, to our purpose nowe, where there shoulde haue bene none inequalitie betwixte the manne and the wyfe, nowe for a punishement for her faulte shee muste be content to heare, <hi>Sub viri potestate eris, &amp; ipse dominabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur tui.</hi> Thou shalte be vnder the power of thy husband, and he shall be thy ruler. And yet let vs consider the goodnes of god, how he vseth mercy with the rod of correction, in this soore beatyng <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of woman kinde, with these two strokes of pain with childe, and of subiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the husband, God hath prouided that the first is eased by the byrth of the childe into the world, which so comforteth the mother, that anone she hath forgotten all the former paine that she toke with her childe. And the second is notably releued, by this that by the dominion and rule of the husbande, the wyfe is much eased of solicitude &amp; thought for outward prouisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of necessaries, &amp; for defence of her right, and for aunswerynge to vniuste vexation, and suche others. And also specially by this, that by the goodnesse and gentle behauiour of the wyfe,
<pb n="clxxxxviii" facs="tcp:12050:218"/>
husbande is manye tymes made much better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he woulde els be. And this saint Peter teacheth in this place, saiynge: <hi>Vt si qui non credunt verbo, per mulierum conuersationem sine verbo lucrifiant.</hi> He woulde specially that they should remember <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> their subiection and gentlenes toward their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes, that if there be anye of their husbandes that peraduenture beleueth not the woorde of God preached amonge theim, whiche the wyues dothe beleue, they maye be wonne and conuerted to Christes faithe, by the holye conuersation of the women without preachinge. When they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider your holye conuersation (sayth saint Peter) with louing feare of God and of your husbands. And here is to be noted that sainte Peter wrote this epistle or letter to the countreis where some were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted to Christes fayth, and some were not. And as the women commonly be more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der harted then the menne, so manye tymes they were soner conuerted to Christes religion, then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the men were. And in this case he exhorteth the women to shew their faithful maner of liuyng by louing obedience &amp; subiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that so bi their good &amp; godly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersation, thei might allure their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same faith y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were of, &amp; to beleue as thei did. And here you se now again how high<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly the blessed apostle estemeth honest conuersati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a meane of as great efficacitie to allure me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to goodnes, as is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of exhortation or prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng, as he had said afore in the second chapter. <hi>Conuersationem vestram inter gentes habentes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam, &amp;c.</hi> Biddynge them be of good conuersati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb facs="tcp:12050:219"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that where men backebite you and saie euill by you, as of malefactours, when they consider your good workes, they maye glorifie God, and be conuerted to God by your good example. And I doubt not but that in this troublelous time of new opinions and errours that hath now many a daye persecuted the mindes of good fayethfull people, the stedfast and faythfull conuersation of the honest wiues hath staied their husbandes in the right trade, and made them good men, where els they would haue erred as others haue done, as well in this citie as in other places. <hi>Quarum non sit extrinsecus capillatura, aut circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>datio auri, aut indumenti vestimentorum cultus.</hi> Because Saint Peter hadde bidde al wiues please their husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> with obedience and due subiection, lest they shoulde thinke thys subiection and pleasynge of their husbandes to stand in trimmyng and dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>synge their bodies curiously and wantonlye for their husbandes pleasures, he declareth that he meaneth nothing lesse, &amp; biddeth theim that they vse not to make their heere for the nonce, settyng it abrode smothly slickt, to make it shine in mens eyes, or curiously platted in traces, or as ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tle wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vse now adaies, purposly neglected ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their eies, as it were saiyng: I care not how my heere lye, and yet while they do so, they most care howe to pull abroade their lockes to be sene. And so when they take vppon them to care least then they care most for their heere. Some there be that can not be contente with their heere as God made it, but dothe painte it and set it in an
<pb n="clxxxxix" facs="tcp:12050:219" rendition="simple:additions"/>
other hue, as when it was white hoore, they dye <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> it fayre and yelowe, or if it be blacke as a crowe, it must be set in some lighter colour, as browne, or aburne, or redde: And so muste their browes and the bryes of their eye lyddes be painted pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porcionably. All this disgisyng of womens heere saint Peter calleth by one name, <hi>Capillatura,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge their heere, or curiouslye dressynge their heere, which he disswadeth and cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>saileth to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary. And .s. Paule .i. <hi>Timo.</hi> ii. biddeth all wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men apparell and raye theim selues in comelye rayment with bashfulnesse or shamefastnes, and with sobrietie. <hi>Non in tortis crinibus,</hi> not wyth their heere platted or sliked abroade. And bothe the blessed Apostles biddeth women not to vse superfluitie, of these golden abilimentes (as they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> be nowe called) nor of ouer costlye rayment das<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed wyth Pearles or precious stones. Sainte Peter calleth suche precious and costlye garnis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shinge of rayment, <hi>Cultus indumenti vestimento<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> as who should saye, <hi>Indumenti indumento<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> or <hi>Vestimenti vestimentorum.</hi> The dressing of the raymente of all raymentes, to signifie the preciousnes or riches of the rayment, as we vse to saye, the flower of all flowers. A felowe of all felowes, to signifie the excellencye of the thinge. Sainte Peter and saint Paule which were sure that they hadde the spirite of God, and spoke by the spirite of God, in Goddes name, disswadeth such costlines, and biddeth women not to set their mindes theron. For as saint Cypriane saieth. <hi>Li. de habitu virginum.</hi> Chastitie in virgin, wife, and
<pb facs="tcp:12050:220"/>
wydowe consisteth and standeth not onely in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> sounde integritie, and wholenes of their flesshe, but also in a certayne shamefastnes and honesty of their apparell, for lightly there is no more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and costlye dressynge then is amonge them whose honestye is lyght cheape. Therfore in no case let your raymente deface and sclaunder the sinceritie and integritie of your bodies, but that like as you kepe your bodyes chaste and cleane after your callynge, whether it be virginitye, mariage, or wydowehode. So let the dressynge of your heades, and the apparelynge of your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes be chaste, cleane, and after a sober fashion, not lyke players disgysed after any wanton ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, least the lightnesse of your dressynge shewe the lightnes of your condicions.

But nowe mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed women wyll pretende and make an excuse by theyr husbandes, sayinge: that they take all the labours in payntinge and trimming them selues to please theyr husbandes, and so doynge, they make theyr husbandes partetakers of theyr of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and consequently of theyr dampnation for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> company sake. And I shall aduertise all maried men, and all them that haue doughters to kepe, that whether the tyrynge or trimminge of your wyues and doughters be for to please you as they say, or to please them selues as you say, that you suffer not theym to vse it, because it is not godlye (as I haue tolde you) and also because of the peryll that may come of it. For when they set them selues forth so curyouselye, and goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade in the streates, or sytteth in theyr shoppe windows, or elles peraduenture at feastes and bankettes with vicious companye, it is not you alone that they woulde haue to loke vpon them, it is not you alone that is pleased with the sight of theim, it is not you alone that casteth theyr eyes after theim, or that draweth longe sighes

of carnall loue after them, this is not the waye <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to kepe theim for youre selues. Beware there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore good husbandes that you set not youre wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues or doughters so to sale, for feare least harme come of it. And you good wiues beware of the daunger and peryll of youre honestye, and speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally beware of the peryll of your soules. If you nouryshe the luste of concupiscence, and sette on fyre the breadynge of sinne so beynge as a sword or dagger to stryke an other man to the hearte, and as a verye poysonne to destroy others, you knowe the perill of it. Wo be to him or her (sayth Chryste) that geueth occasion of ruyne, woo and sorowe euerlastinge in hell. Beare not your sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues proude of youre husbandes riches, sayinge: my husbande hath landes and rentes to maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> all the costes that I do vpon me, my hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande hath golde inoughe in his coffers, his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches commeth in and encreaseth dayelye: The time shall comme that you shall saye wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginge youre handes, and gnasshinge youre teeth in Hell. <hi>Sapient, v.

            <p>They that haue synned, shall saye after this manner in Hell. What dydde oure pryde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle vs? Or what profitte hadde we by boastynge of oure ryches?

<pb facs="tcp:12050:223"/>
thy riches, and bestowe it not in superfluous or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namentes. Study to dresse youre soules (sayth S.

And also that your spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite be modest, kepinge a meane and measure in all your sayinges and doinges, such a soule (saith S. Peter) <hi>est in conspectu dei locuples,</hi> is ryche in the sight of God, for the true riches is the riches of vertues, they wyll stycke by vs, where other be fluxe and fadinge, and wyll awaye. Suche is the riches that we ought to be glad of, for these we ought to laboure: and with suche riches S. Peter biddeth all wyues to adorne them selues, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to be cleane in soule: and as for outwarde dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>synge, to kepe an honeste measure as besemeth women, shewinge sadnes and honestie, in hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyfery and in good dedes. <hi>Sic enim aliquando et sanctae mulieres sperantes in deo ornabant se subiecte propriis viris.</hi> For so (sayth he) holye women that hoped and trusted in God, arayed theym selues here afore in olde time, whiche were subiect and obedient to theyr owne husbandes. Example he taketh of Sara, that was wyfe to the blessed Patriarch Abraham. I thinke that yf we sawe nowe in oure time the tiringe of her, the dressing of her head, and the whomelines of her raiment,
<pb n="cciii" facs="tcp:12050:223"/>
it woulde make vs laughe, and yet it was good and huswyfely for that time I doubte not. But <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the rayment that S. Peter commendeth in her, was the raymente of her soule, her prompte and ready subiection and obedience to her husbande, she forsoke her countrey, and her kinred and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintaunce, to accompanye him, and do as he woulde haue her to do. And in processe, when the thre aungels appeared like men to Abraham sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at his dore, and he inuited the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to his house, he badde Sara his wyfe make spede, to take floure and knede it, to make them a cake baken vnder a panne for theyr dinner, she ful obediently did as she was bid, while he runne to his herde of catell, and toke a fat yonge calfe and gaue it to his seruaunte to dresse it and to seeth it, and so with mylke and butter, and that sodde veale,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> he made them good chere, I trowe theyr drynke was water, for it was in the feruent heat of the daye, and in a hote countreye, woulde God men coulde be content with suche hospitalitie now a dayes, there should many more be fedde then be, and the hospitalitie should be more acceptable to God then it is nowe, with diuersitie of exquisite disshes, dasshed with spices and delicate wynes, and vsed for kynredde and freindes, and suche as can requyte lyke agayne: If poore people haue anye thinge, it is those scrappes that be nexte the dogges meate. And yet more, when Abraham her husband badde her that she should not saye that she was his wyfe, but that she was
<pb facs="tcp:12050:224"/>
his sister, and he her brother, she dydde so as the time serued. And more ouer Sainte Peter no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth her obedience and subiection to her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande, by that she called him her Lorde, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that was whan the Aungell told Abraham that Sara his wife shoulde beare him a chylde, she stode behynde the bowre doore and smiled, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge: What, shall I playe the wanton nowe in mine olde age, <hi>&amp; Dominus meus vetulus est</hi>? and my Lorde is an olde man? It was her husband that she called Lorde, in that gyuinge to all wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues example of subiection and obedience to their husbandes: And Saynte Peter sayeth to all wyues, you be all her doughters as longe as you doo well, and lyke sobre matrones as shee dydde, and so doynge, you shall not nede to feare any trouble or displeasure of youre husbandes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> but shall liue quietelye and louingely together.</p>

            <p>Saynt Ambrose. <hi>Epist. lxxxii.</hi> sayth, the wyfe muste do reuerence to the husbande, as to her heade and ruler, but no seruice, as his seruaunt, drudge, or bondwoman. She muste be contente <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to be ruled by her husbande, but not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by correction, no, not so muche as by chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge. For <hi>indigna est coniugio quae digna est iur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio,</hi> she is not worthye to be a wyfe, that is worthye to be chydde. Then you maye be sure she is muche moore vnworthye to be a wyfe that wyll not doo her owne woorke withoute strokes: her husbandes woorke is her owne woorke. Strokes be mete for youre leude ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes and bondewomen, and not for youre makes. Therefore all wyues when they wyll deserue beatinge, they reneige and refuse the honestie of a wyfe, retourning to seruantes state agayne. They shoulde not be taken furth with the graue and sadde matrones, and with honest

wyues, but let them come behynde with the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> because they haue not lefte theyr ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyle conditions. And then (good men) as you woulde your wyues should honoure you, so must you parte honoure with theym, honourynge the woman as the weaker vessell (sayth S. Peter.) And yf she be crabbed and shrewshaken, yet you must beare with her as ye woulde she should for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare you when you be oute of the waye, in your fume or in your rage. Socrates that noble Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher had two wyues (as S.

On a tyme after she had bytterly scol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led and rayled at hym, he went from her, and let her alone, and as he wente forth of the dore, she bestowed the purtinence of a chaumber vessell <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> vpon his head for his fare well, he dyd no more but with his handekercheife wiped his heade, and sayde: I knewe it woulde be thus, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thunder clappes woulde come a showre. And when hys scholers and freendes woulde aske hym howe he coulde forbeare her, and why he dryue her not oute of his doores? No (sayeth he) not so, I haue a iewell of her, for she doeth so exercyse my patience, that when I come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade, I care not what anye man sayeth or doeth to me, it greueth me not, I am so vsed to suffer her, that none other can greue me: For true it is that <hi>trouble worketh patience.</hi> Manye

Christen men be taughte by oure Sauioure Chryste, that howe soeuer the conditions of the man or the woman be, they must euerye one suffer the other, for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for worse, tyll death theym departe.

Saynte Ambrose <hi>Exameron. libro. v. cap. vii.</hi> reciteth a notable example to moue all maried folkes as well men as women, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde and to agree together. The example is of the lamprey, and a serpente called <hi>Vipera nequis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simum genus bestie,</hi> a serpent mooste mischeuous and venemous. If there be anye of theim with vs, it is the adder. The propertie of this serpent is this, when he lyste to gendre, specially where he breadeth nighe the Sea coaste, he commeth to the water syde and there hisseth after his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, callynge to him his make the Lampreye, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> with his continuall hyssynge. The Lampreye, as soone as she perceaueth hym there, draweth to the shoore, and shalowe water, and when the adder spyeth her commynge, he vommiteth and braketh awaye oute of him selfe all hys poysonne and venome, and so commeth to her cleane and holesome, and then companieth with her, and then they gendre together.</p>
            <p>Here maye the manne and the womanne learne to beare and suffer euerye one the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the other. Here maye the manne learne to ordre his wife with sobrenes, and the wyfe
<pb n="ccvi" facs="tcp:12050:227"/>
to be gentle and obediente. What thynge is worse then venomme of a Serpente? And yet the Lampreye feareth not that, in her make the adder, she commeth gentillye at his callinge, and louingelye embraseth hym.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore good wyues, yf youre husbandes be venomous, crabbed, and cumberous, or (as you call it) shrewe shaken, you muste come at his callynge, doo as he byddeth you, be gentle vnto him, and so thoughe his venome hurte others, it shall not hurte you. And you marryed men, be you prudente as the Serpente, worke wyse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, and laye awaye youre venomme, when you shall companye with youre makes, that is alwaye and euer, for you muste euer dwell with her (as Saynte Peter sayeth here) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you muste alwaye laye awaye youre poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonne, so that you vse none towarde her. You muste alwaye laye downe as well all your chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lysshe swellynge, as all youre Lordelye and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> proude fasshion, lette her perceaue none suche in you, remember you be not her Lorde (as I sayde) ye be but her husbande, and her make. The Adder layeth awaye his poysonne for his make the Lampreyes sake, and so must you do away all pryde, malice, and crabbednes for your wiues sake, and so doinge you shall dwell with your wyfe, <hi>secundum scientiam,</hi> accordinge to sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and wisedome (as Saynt Peter sayth here) considerynge that she is the weaker vessell, the weaker creature, for all we be Goddes vesselles,

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> eyther the vessels of Goddes yre, or the vesselles of his mercye. The woman for the mooste parte is weaker then the man, in mynde and also in bodye, and dysposed to more infyrmities, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you muste do her honoure accordyngelye. This worde <hi>honoure</hi> in Scripture hath a large signification: sometyme it signifieth reuerence and obedience, and so it is not taken here, for the man oweth none suche to the wyfe: Sometime it signifieth prouision of necessaryes, and so is it taken in the commaundemente of GOD, of the honoure that euerye man oweth to his paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, for whome he muste not onelye bowe with cappe and knee, but also is bounde to prouyde for theim necessaryes if they nede. Thyrde, in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> this place of Saynte Peter, it maye signifie ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neste intreatynge of her in youre coniugall acte, in whiche you muste vse science and wysedome, knowinge that the sayde acte, for the entent to gette chyldren to be broughte vppe in Chrystes fayth and in vertue, is good and commendable: if it be to releiue the infyrmitie of the fleshe, and to kepe you from others, it is tollerable, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse to do lyke brute beastes for prolongynge of thy luste, is vycious and sinnefull, you muste geue honoure and spare her, and not mysvse her in this manner.

in suche case, you muste geue honoure and spare <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> her, cherysshe and comforte her: you muste also honoure her with solicitude and prouision, that she lacke nothinge necessarye. Remember that she is coinheritoure, and copartener of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious gyfte of lyfe euerlastynge in heauen, as well as you, therefore vse her thereafter, not as a fylthie wretche woulde vse a calotte or a strumpette, the vesselles of Goddes indignation and wrath, apte for destruction and dampna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

If you be not cleane of conuersation, absteininge for causes aboue mencioned, but folowe youre luste lyke beastes, you shall hindre youre prayers that they shall not be hearde.

In conclusion to be short, be al of one minde, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> in the epistle of the said fift sundaye after the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, it is read: <hi>Omnes vnamines in oratione estote.</hi> Be you all of one minde in your praiers, whyche might seme to haue some coherence to that went immediatlye afore, where he bade the man and wife to agree, lest by the contrary by theyr dissen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sion and variaunce theyr prayers mighte be lette and hindred. And then accordinge to the same he willeth all men and women to be of one minde in theyr praiers, for if there be discord among them, theyr prayers wil not be heard. But let vs take this text of Saint Peters epistle as it is writ in the common translation, <hi>In fide omnes vnanimes,</hi> Be all of one minde in your faithe, as they were that be spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of. <hi>Act. iiii.

For where is concord and vnitie, there the holye gost spreadeth his grace aboundantly, and contrarye where be scismes and diuersitie of errours and opinions, God withdraweth grace, and then me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> runne without brydell from one opinion to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from one heresie to an other, tyll men be set all on a rore and out of quietnes, as it appeareth euidently in Germany, wher be almost as manie heresies and diuers waies in theyr faith, as be ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or townes, euery citie taking his own wai &amp; his own fashio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts &amp; ceremonies.

This confusion S.

Som wil prai for the dead, som wil not, I heare of muche suche <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> discension among you, I will not descende to the specialties, but with s.

Let vs take example of our own lims in our own bodies, if one hande be not able to do thy busines, anon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth the other hand to worke, and if thy handes wyl not serue, thou settest to thy foote, yea, &amp; if nede be thy teth and al. If any part of our bodie be hurt, the eyes seketh for a plaister, the fete laboreth to seke a sur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gion, the tonge laboreth declaring the griefe and

praying for help, &amp; so euery part of our bodies ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> paine &amp; laboreth one for an other, and with an other, so considering that we be the lymmes of Christes body, we should louingly one bear with an other to releue the paine and laboure that we see our neighbour susteine. If there be iii. or .iiii. bearing a great burden, if ther be a good felow or two that wil com &amp; set to theyr shulders to bear with them, this wil greatly lighten theyr burthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ease them &amp; comfort theym, so when he that is in paine seeth other men sory &amp; ready to set to their handes to releue him, ease him, and comfort him, this mitigateth his paine wondersly, and this is true as wel in spiritual infirmities of the soule, as in bodely paynes and infirmities. After this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> saynt Paule toke the diseases of other men. <hi>ii. Cor. xi.

Heretikes haue gathered to them special companies which they haue called a brotherhed, as now in our time mani callith their confederacie the brotherhead, but they be but pat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ched peces and cantels of the brotherhead. They <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> diuideth, disperseth, &amp; scattereth that vniuersal and comon brotherhead that Saynt Peter here speaketh of, rather then aduanceth it or dothe it any good. They be cantels broken of from the ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tholike &amp; vniuersal brotherhed of faithful christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people, they semed somtime to be of the brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed, but they wer not trueli &amp; stedfastly of them, for as s, Iohn saith .i. <hi>Ioh. ii. If they had bene of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they wold haue taried with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> but by theyr swar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing away, they manifestly shew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues that they wer no true members of Christes misticall body the catholik churche, but rather like super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous &amp; corrupt humors euomited &amp; cast out to

When the comon knot of fraternitie is once broken, then men take theyr li<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bertie and run at large, euery man as his opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> will draw him, till at the last they marre all. And euyn so it is in cities and townes and great comi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nalties, except men loue better the comontie and the comon wealth, then theyr singuler profit and auantage, the state of the towne or citie decayeth and all goeth to ruine. Examples we rede of the Romanes, which while they magnified the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, prospered wonderouslye, but after they had broughte the rule and authoritie of the citie into the power of a few perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, so that none should rule but they. And afterwarde when they were striken with ambition and desyre of honor that euery man would be a lorde and a ruler, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> by intestine battels, seditions, and parts ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>king, al cam to nought, they lost all theyr royaltie and dominions, a great deale faster the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had got them afore. You haue in this citie erect a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine confederacie, which you call the companye, I pray God it may do well, but I perceiue a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine mundanitie in it, a worldlye couetous caste to bring the gaines that was indifferent &amp; como<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to al the marchants of this citie into the handes of a fewe persones. Therefore good neyghbours loue the whole brotherhed &amp; vniuersal companie of Christes faithful people, diuide it not, &amp; if ther

Our saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ in the gospell, exhorting vs to mercye, like as our father in heauen is mercifull, putteth thre kindes of mercie. <hi>Luc. vi.</hi> One consisteth in not iudging nor condempning our neighbour of ani mortal crime without euident signes. For he that withoute euidence of a manyfest facte, or of such signes as can not be countersayd &amp; excused by any tergiuersacion will iudge hys neighbour and inwardly condempne him as a malefactour, hath a cruel hart and is not merciful. The second kinde of mercy that our sauiour speaketh of ther, standeth in forgiuing offences done to vs, like as we wolde be forgiue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>Dimittite et dimittetur vobis,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> forgiue, and you shall be forgiuen. But because that in the naughty world that now runneth by ouermuch suffering, ill persons may take occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of boldnes to do yll. It is not at al times ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to forgiue both the offence and the iniury. The offence and displeasure of minde, and the yll wil to the person that hathe offended thee, muste nedes be forgiuen and layd away, but the wrong done vnto thee, thou mayst redresse by the order of the lawes, euer without any sinister desyre or purpose to vndo or notabli to hurt him that thou suest at the lawes. Notwithstanding if thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue the iniuri aswel as the offence, it is a dede of superogacion &amp; wel done, &amp; shal not be vnrewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

This example of our maister Christ saint Peter brought in to teach vs that thei that being good and vertuous, yet suffreth vexatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and trouble, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> they folow Christ, whiche in like maner suffered iniuries, paines, and passion that he neuer deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.

against Christe as others did, and descended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> hell, to paynes euerlastynge. The newe tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation readeth this place. <hi>Mortificatus quide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> carne viuificatus autem spiritu.</hi> speaking of Christ which was mortified in the fleshe, bodely diyng for vs, and was viuificate and euer aliue in the spirite, for his soule neuer dyed, in signe and token that by his example we shoulde likewise do: gostly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge to all carnalitie, and euer liuinge spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as I saide afore. <hi>In quo &amp; his qui in carcere e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant spiritibus veniens predicauit.</hi> This text is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerslye expounded, one way thus. In which spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, bi which he was euer aliue, Christ came and preached to the spirites that were in prison, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che once were harde of beleue, when they loked for Goddes pacience and longe sufferance in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> dayes of Noe, while the Arche or greate shippe was a makinge, in whiche shippe a fewe, that is to saie. viii. liues were saued bi the water, lifting vp the shippe a flote from the daunger of drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Christ came in spirite, and preached to the spirites that were in pryson. The workes of the whole Trinitie be al one outwarde amonge the creatures (as I haue manye times tolde you) therfore in that that almighty God inspired the blessed patriarch Noe to preach vnto the people of his time, penaunce and amendement of lyfe, it maye be saide that the father in spirite preached to the people then beinge in pryson, and that the sonne in spirite preached to the same prysoners, and that the holy goste in spirite preached to the same people. For the whole trinitie inspired Noe
<pb facs="tcp:12050:245"/>
to preache, therfore it is true that euery persone <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> in trinitie did it. And so it mai be said that Christ preached to theim, for that is true of the seconde person in trinitie is true of Christe. <hi>Per commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicationem idiomatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> As we say, the sonne of god is a man, and a man is the sonne of God. And so we say that the sonne of god suffred death on the crosse, &amp; that a man made the starres in the skye, Because of the perfit vnion and knot of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head to the manhode in one person, and the same person that now is incarnate and made man did it. And he preached to the Prysoners that were dull in beleuyng, Noe tellyng theim Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and threatenyng, to destroy the world wyth water except they would amende. And yet they were hard of beleue, and loked for more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour at Gods hand, and for longer pacience, and forbearynge theim, and so trifled tyll the floude <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> came vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and drowned them. They were in pryson (sayth .s. Peter) whiche after this exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion must be vnderstande morally, in as much as they were bounde as prysoners by the bondes of sinne, as the prophet speaketh. <hi>Funes peccatorum circumplexi su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t me.</hi> The ropes of sins haue wrapt me in rounde aboute, and likewise speaketh the wiseman. <hi>Pro. v. Iniquitates sue capiunt impiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; fu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nibus peccatorum suorum constringetur.</hi> His owne iniquities taketh the wicked persone, and wyth the ropes of his owne sinnes he shalbe strayned &amp; knit. And in that case were the people of Noes tyme, for all mankinde had corrupt his way, and
<pb n="ccxxiiii" facs="tcp:12050:245"/>
the maner of his liuing. <hi>Omnis caro corruperat vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am suam. Gen. vi.</hi> All flesh, all men left vertue and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> liued insolently, &amp; viciously. This is one expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this text of .s. Peter. But this exposition though it be good &amp; catholike, yet it semeth more moral then litteral, because it taketh the name of the prison, &amp; of them that were in pryson moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the custome &amp; vse of sinne, &amp; not for a place where a prisoner is kept in paine &amp; sorow to his displesure: &amp; it taketh the prisoner for him that is intangled, poluted, &amp; defaced with the deformity of customable sinne. This prisoner though he be in extreme peril &amp; daunger of soule, yet not know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>yng the case that he standeth in, maketh merye, &amp; fealeth no harme, nor paine, but counteth hym self most at liberty, &amp; at hartes ease. Therfore I thinke .s. Peter speaketh of the spirits or soules <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that woulde not regard the exhortation of Noe made vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for amendme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of their liues, tyll the very floude came vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And then se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the water rise higher &amp; higher, &amp; men and wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men, and other liuynge creatures perishe in the same floude, and that there was no place able to saue them from drownynge, they toke remorse of conscience, and repentaunce, as well for their hardnesse of harte contemnynge Noes exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as for their owne naughty liuynge, &amp; so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng for mercy, were receyued to mercy, &amp; saued their soules. Yet in asmuch as the gate to heauen was not opened bi Christ, thei were staied in the skirt of hel, a place prouided by GOD to receiue
<pb facs="tcp:12050:246"/>
their soules that died in the state of grace, and in Gods fauour, in whiche if they hadde any thinge to be purged, as for venial sinnes, or for lacke of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> sufficient satisfaction for mortall offences done by their life tyme, hadde first greuous paines for their purgation, and then consequently were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued into Abrahams bosome, a place of tranqui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>litie, rest, and quietnes, where they had no sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble payne. They hadde none other paine, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye the paine of lacke of glorye, which doubtlesse was a greuous payne for theim that daylie and hourely loked for it, as the wisemanne saithe. <hi>Pro. xiii. Spes que differtur affligit animam.</hi> The hoope that is prolonged and put of, vexeth and punisheth the minde. Amonge these were manye of them that were swalowed vp in the water at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Noes floude, Yet diynge penitent (as I sayd) of which saint Peter here maketh special mencion, vnderstandynge by them all the rest of the holye fathers that were in the same pryson, and in the paine of lacke of glory.

I haue declared to you here afore what is an idole, and what is Idolatrye. An Idole and an Image is not all one. Euerye Idole is an Image, but not contrarywyse. For when Christe asked them for the coyne of their money, and they brought hym a Denere, he asked not whose is thys idol? but whose is thys ymage? An Image properly representeth a naturall thinge: or a thinge that is or hathe bene, or maye bee, as the Image of the Crucifixe. An Idole representeth and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> neuer was nor can be, as when a man maketh a picture to represent the God Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter, or the Goddesse Uenus, whiche nother be nor can be, for there is no god Iupiter, nor god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse
<pb facs="tcp:12050:257"/>

Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what soeuer representeth them for Goddes muste neades be an Idole. You make an Image an Idole, geuynge diuine honoure vnto it, or lokynge for helpe of it, or thinkynge that one I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of our Ladie can helpe thee better then an other, for there is in the Image no suche diuine power.

And so thou makest an Idole of thy wife, or of thy childe by ouermuche louynge theim or cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shynge theim, and doinge more for theim then thou wouldest do for GOD. And slackynge or leauinge thy duetye to God to please theim, after the maner of Saynte Paules speakynge, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> when he calleth Auarice <hi>Idoloru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> seruitus,</hi> Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse is Idolatry, because the couetous man maketh his money his Idole and his GOD, doinge more for to gette richesse, then he woulde do to get God. And takinge more minde on ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches then on God. And doing that for his goods sake, that he woulde not do for Gods sake. And after this manner you maie make an Idole of the newest Image that is, if you wyll geue it suche honoure as is not kindelye for it. Make no more of an Image, but onelye take it as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenter to signifye, and to put you in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce of the thinge that it is made after, and passe no more vppon it. <hi>In quo admirantur non

Saint Peter considering the manifold trou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bles of this world that vertuous faithful people be euer cumbred with al, and also considering the shortnes of our abode here, that it wil away, and is come to an ende, therefore he saithe: <hi>be you pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and watch in praiers.</hi> Be you prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t (he saith) there be diuers maners of prudence.

Euen so be these world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wise men whiche be neuer well but when they be gathering riches &amp; mucke of the worlde, more seruing theyr riches then seruing God.

yet proud men semeth worsse then he was, for he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> desired no more but to be like GOD, and equall with God, but the proude man woulde be better then God. For where God woulde haue his will fulfilled and done when it is iuste and good: the proude man would haue his will done and fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, whither it be right or wrong. Against al these worldly prudences and wisedomes saith almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, as it is rehersed <hi>.i. Cor. i. I shall destroy the wisedome of worldlye wise men and shall reproue the prudence and prouidence of suche prudent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>: Hath not God (saith the Apostle) made the wisedome of the world very foolishnes? It hath pleased almightye God to saue faithfull people by the preaching of the gospell, whiche worldlye wisemen repute and take as very foolishnes, and as a foolishe thinge. They take theyr policie and worldly prouidence as thoughe it came of theym selues and not of God, and therefore they thanke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> not God for it, neither honour him, but rather la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and studie to destroy his honour &amp; to que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch it, and therefore God of his iust iudgement ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times taketh that awaye from theym that he gaue them so that while they thincke them selues wise, they proue verye fooles, and God turneth theyr cast and theyr drift to a frustratorie, vayne and foolishe end contrarye to theyr expectacion. The prudence and wisedome that Sainte Peter in this place of his epistle that wee haue in hande woulde haue vs to vse, is spirituall prudence, the wisedome of the spirite, of the whiche S.

               <pb facs="tcp:12050:268"/>
The wisedome of the spirite by which man wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> according to the inclination of the holi spirit is life and peace, that is to saye, it is the cause of life euerlasting, and of peace and quietnes here, &amp; to ioyn them together, it is the cause of life with peace and quietnes euerlasting in heauen. Thys wysedome no sinner hathe, as appeareth manye wayes. <hi>Fyrst,</hi> because a sinner loseth a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritaunce for a little trifle of pleasure, as Esau did for a messe of potage, as I sayd afore. And it is writte. <hi>Iob. xxviij. Sapientia non inuenitur in terra suauiter niuentium,</hi> Wysedome is not founde in the londe or countrey of them that liueth delicatelye all at pleasure. <hi>Seconde,</hi> sinners lacketh prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, for they little regarde to recouer theyr inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce againe, where they might so doe with a little la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and payne like them that be spoken of in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> psalme, <hi>pro nihilo habuerunt terram desiderbilem,</hi> The Israelites estemed not the delectable lande that was promised them, but would rather haue turned backe agayne into Egipt, euen so do syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners desperately litle regarde the land of life euer lasting in heauen. <hi>Thirde,</hi> a synner lacketh pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, because he doth wilfully cast him selfe into the snares of him that will not fayle to draw him and strangle him to death euerlastynge. Byrdes that bee meshede in a nette, canne not gette out when they woulde wythout helpe, but the more they stryue, the sorer they be holden in the nette, Euen so saythe the wyseman. <hi>Prouer. v.

The seconde kynde of prudence may be called <hi>Circumspection,</hi> by which we loke well about, and take good hede that we do truely kepe the meane of vertue, so that while we exchew and auoyde one vice, we fall not into the other extremitie and contrarye vice, as that while we auoide auarice and couetousenes, we fall not into prodigalitie and wastfulnes: and that whyle we auoyde cowardnes, we fall not into folishe hardines, or to rasshe brainesicknes. They be not circumspecte inough, that so exchu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and auoideth from temporall trouble and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> payne, that they runne into euerlastinge payne, or that so flieth from worldly pouertie, that they fall into euerlastinge nede and scarcitie, when they shall begge and nothinge shall be geuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. All such be like a skittish starting horse, whiche coming ouer a bridge, wil start for a shadowe, or for a stone lying by him, and leapeth ouer on the other side into the water, &amp; drowneth both horse and man. Another kind of prudence is <hi>Cautio,</hi> wa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rines, lest we be begiled with vices cloked vnder the colour of vertues, as Amasa was begiled of Ioab. <hi>ii. Reg. xx.</hi> This Ioab fearing least Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa shoulde haue ben made cheife captayne of the warres of kinge Dauid, enuied him, and dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with him, and as thei were setting forward to a certaine batail, met with him, &amp; louingly sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted him, and toke him by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chin, as though he
<pb n="ccl" facs="tcp:12050:272"/>
would haue kissed him, and said to him, <hi>salue mi <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> frater,</hi> God spede my cosin (for in dede they were sisters children) he had a weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by his side, with whiche he stroke him in the side that his guttes fell out, and so he died. There is none so perilous gyle, as that is hidde vnder the similitude and co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lour of frendship. By this kinde of prudence we shal spie when pride disgiseth him self vnder the similitude &amp; name of clenlines, and when lechery is cloked &amp; taken for loue: and we shall perceaue that in great aboundaunce, &amp; in worldly welth, is hid much indigence, nede, &amp; lacke of vertue and grace, and also that vnder the ignominie, shame, and sclaundre of Christes crosse, is most excellent pulchritude and beautie, &amp; that vnder the folish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of preaching of Christ (as many hath taken <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> it) is couered most godlye vertue and wysedome. Our sauiour exhorteth vs to prudence &amp; wisdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e by example of a serpent, <hi>Estote prudentes sicut ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentes, Mat. x.</hi> Be you wise like serpentes. The serpent to saue her heade, wyll laye forth all the whole body in daunger and perill, and so should we do to conserue and saue Christe in vs, and to kepe his fayth and his graces in vs, we shoulde lay al our bodies in daunger, rather losing body, goodes and all, then him. And therefore s. Paule saith. <hi>Rom. viii. who can separate or diuide vs from the charitie and loue of Christ? I am sure that nother death nor life, neither any other creature can parte vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the loue of god that we haue in christ Iesu</hi>: thus soyth s. Paule in the name of euery good christen man &amp; woman. Second, we may learne prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
<pb facs="tcp:12050:273"/>
by the serpent, whiche when he casteth his olde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> slowe or skin, he crepeth into some straite place, as betwixt stones or blockes, or rockes, &amp; there stripeth him selfe cleane out of his olde scurfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a new skinne. And so must we do, we must get vs into the strait waye of penaunce, and by that stripe cleane away from vs our olde faultes and sinnes. <hi>Eph. iiii. Deponite vos secundum pristinam conuersationem veterem hominem qui corrumpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur secundum desideria erroris.</hi> Put downe awaye from you your olde man, your olde maner of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge, in lustes of errours, all oute of the righte waye of iustice and of good liuinge. Thirde, the serpent when he perceiueth a charmer aboute to charme him oute of his hole or denne, he laieth one of his eares faste to the grounde, and stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the other eare with his taile. By whiche propertie we be taught against the suggestions of oure goostly enemies, to stoppe one eare with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the earth, that is, the remembraunce of our own vilenes and infirmitie, and the other eare with oure taile, that is to saye, with the remembrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of our death and ende, to whiche we drawe day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>Eccle. vii. In omnibus operibus tuis memorare nouissima &amp; ineternum non peccabis.</hi> In all thy workes remember thy last ende, and thou shalte neuer sinne, but shall euer haue a good and ready soule to god. And that we all may so haue, he graunt vs, that by his pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful passion redemed vs. Amen.</p>

The Apostle S. Peter wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth you to take good hede where aboute we go, sayinge: <hi>Et vigilate in orationibus,</hi> And watche in prayers. Slepe not in youre prayers, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill slepeth not, but watcheth craftely to pull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye your hearte from you, and from the thinge that you intende to praye for.

And thoughe praier be necessary at all times and in all places, yet at this time, when holye Churche readeth this processe that we haue nowe in hande for the Epistle of the Masse, we shoulde be moost vigilaunte and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in prayer, that we mighte be the more apte and mete to receiue into the hostrie of our soules the holie Goostes graces, at this holye time of
<pb facs="tcp:12050:274"/>
Whitsontide now comming. And so did the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed virgin Marye mother of Christe, with other holy women, and the Apostles, after that they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> had sene Christes ascention, they retourned to Ierusalem, and got them into an hie halle, or a lofte, where they were <hi>perseuerantes vnanimiter in oratione,</hi> continuinge in prayer, withoute anye notable interruption. <hi>Vnanimiter,</hi> al of one mind, knitte together by the bondes of Charitie, for so must they be that do wait and loke for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gost. For <hi>Spiritus discipline effugiet fictu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Sap. i.</hi> The holy spirite that geueth learninge, wyll flye from one that is fayned, that fayneth him self, or is a dissembler. Therfore he that will haue that holy spirit, let him continue in praier, &amp; in vnitie, concorde, and charitie in hearte and minde. And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> euen so S. Peter exhorteth vs here, saying: <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te omnia autem mutuam in vobismetipsis charitate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> continuam habentes.</hi> Afore all thinge you muste haue within your selues continual charitie, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one to another, <hi>Quia charitas operit multitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> peccatorum,</hi> for Charitie couereth the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of synnes. That you may obtaine and gette of almyghtye God, that you praye for, aboue all thynges be sure of Charitie, by whiche you may do good to others as well as to youre selues. Accordinge to this Saynt Iames sayth. <hi>Iaco. v. He that causeth a synner to retourne from his errour, shall saue his soule from death, and shall couer the multitude of his synnes.</hi> And the prophete sayeth, <hi>Psalm. xxxi. Beati quorum remisse sunt iniquitates, &amp; quorum tecta sunt peccata.</hi> Blessed be they whose
<pb n="cclii" facs="tcp:12050:274"/>
iniquities be forgiuen, and whose sinnes be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> But for this you must vnderstande, that oure sinnes may be couered two maner of way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es: one waye is by the sinners owne dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hydynge, and clokinge. But after this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to hyde oure sinnes maketh vs not blessed, but rather accursed, in as muche as they styll re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne, and liueth in the sinne, or to the increase of his damnation. Another maner of couerynge oure synnes, is when they be so couered, that God seeth them not, and that is to saye: that he imputeth them not to vs, nor leyeth them to our charge, for after the maner of speakinge of scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, then he seith sinnes and loketh vpon them, when he punisheth them, and then he seith them not when he doth not punisshe them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the prophet sayde in another place: <hi>Auerte faciem tuam a peccatis meis</hi>: Tourne awaye thy face from my sinnes. As who shoulde saye, with the eyes of thy mercy loke vppon me, and se me, but see not my synnes, but as it were one that had forgotte theim, punysshe theim not, knowe theim not, but forgeue them, and impute theim not to me, nor laye them to my charge. And in this case be they, that wythoute gyle or dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation vttereth theyr synnes: Of suche it is sayde. <hi>Nec est in spiritu eius dolus</hi>: In suche a mans spyryte there is no gyle, where contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rywyse, they that vseth gyle and clookynge theyr faultes, howe muche the moore they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure in defence of theyr synnes, boastynge
<pb facs="tcp:12050:275"/>
their owne merites, and their owne well doin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and seith not their owne iniquities, nother speaketh of theim, so muche their goostlie forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and might decaieth, and waxeth weaker. And therefore againste proude men that trusted muche in their owne good dedes, and would not be a knowen of their faultes, Christe putteth a parable of the proude Pharisei and the humble publicane: The Pharisei praised him selfe of his vertues, but he spoke nothinge of his faultes: The publicane cloked not, dissembled not, vsed no gyle, but toke vpon him as he was, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the one was iustified and iudged for a good man, where the other was condempned. Christe defended the Publicane and gaue sentence, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitinge him as not giltie, and couered his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, not any more to impute them to him, or to laye them to his charge, where the proud Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sei <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> euen in the temple, in the Surgions shoppe, and vnder the Surgions hande, shewed forth his whole limmes, where he was not sicke nor soore, declaringe his vertues, but his sinnes he couered and hidde from the Surgion, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was not cured, he might haue sayd, <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam tacui inueterauerunt ossa mea dum clamarem tota die.</hi> Because I helde me styll my bones we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed olde and decayde to noughte, while I cryed al day longe. The bones of the soule be vertues, for as the bones of the bodye maketh the bodye stronge, so doth vertues make the soule stronge. These bones, these vertues decayeth and dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth to nought, whyle we be styl and cry al day
<pb n="ccxxxviii" facs="tcp:12050:275"/>
longe. A straunge maner of speakinge of the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> It is eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the same maner that I spake of nowe: The Pharisei was styll and helde his tounge, and yet cried to loude: he was styll, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge and hidinge his faultes with scilence, and yet he was loude ynough, bosting and praysing him selfe of his vertues and of his well doinges, of whiche he shoulde haue spoken not a worde, and therfore his vertues auailed him not to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of his soule, but decaied to nought as his soule did. So (good neighbours) there be inough and to many of vs, that crye loude inough, boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stynge and praysinge our well doinges, yf anye be, but to speake and confesse our faultes we be styll ynough, and holde our tonges. As manye men of their glottenye, of drinkinge men vnder <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the borde, of ryottinge and surfettinge, and of wastfull bankettinge, and of theyr pryde &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious taunting of pore men, &amp; of sclaunderinge and backebiting, they take no remorse or grudge of conscience, but rather reioyce in mind, &amp; make much boasting outwarde of the same. They vse not to reuele &amp; vtter such faultes to theyr goost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly father, and to almighty God, with contrition and sorow for them, but rather glorieth in their ill doinges, to the increase of theyr owne damp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: If they woulde with a lowly heart vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer them to the surgion, he woulde make them whole, where as if they be hidde, they wil rankel and fester to euerlastinge corruption. Pryde ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a man to hide his faultes to his dampnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Charitie putteth awaye Pryde. <hi>Charitas
<pb facs="tcp:12050:276"/>
enim non inflatur,</hi> Charitie is not proude, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> therfore it disposeth a man to humilitie, making him contente to shewe him selfe as he is, to the surgion, and so he shall be cured and well at ease before God. <hi>Beatus enim cui non imputauit domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus peccatum.</hi> He is blessed to whose charge oure lorde God hath not layde any sinnes, but geuing him charitie, couereth his synnes. S. Peter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideringe this, exhorteth vs aboue all thinges to haue charitie, for it couereth the multitude of sinnes. And therfore it may be called a holesome and healthfull garment for the soule, for diuers necessarye properties of a garment. Fyrste like as a garment conserueth and kepeth a mannes lyuelye and naturall heate within him, so doeth charitie conserue the lyfe of the soule, so that he that lacketh it, lacketh lyfe and is dead. <hi>i. Ioh. iii. Qui non diligit manet in morte,</hi> He that hath not loue or charitie, abideth in death, he is all colde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and stiffed. This liuely heate of the soule is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued and saued by kepinge the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of god, which be al comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in loue or charitie, accordinge to Christes aunswer to a certayne learned man that apposed him, saying: <hi>maister, what shall I do to haue euerlastinge life</hi>? Christ apposed him again in his owne learning. <hi>what is written in the lawe? howe reade you? He aunswered: Thou shalte loue God aboue all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, with thy whole hearte, with thy whole soule, with all thy strength, and with all thy mynde: And thy neighbour as thy selfe. Thou sayest wel</hi> (sayeth Christ) <hi>Hoc fac &amp; uiues, do that and thou shalt liue.</hi> And all this is done by kepinge the ten commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
<pb n="ccliiii" facs="tcp:12050:276"/>
of God. In the thre fyrste commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes we be taught howe to order our loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde God, and in the seuen last, howe we shall extende our loue to our neyghbours. And yf we perfourme and fulfyll these for loue, we shall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> please God, and deserue heauen by them, where as yf we kepe them onely for feare, we would do the contrary if we might, and be no thanke wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thye. Albeit better it is to fulfyll the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes for feare, then not to fulfyll theim at al: for by oft doyng wel for feare, we may gendre a loue to wel doing, &amp; so at last we shal do wel for loue, and shall haue a swetenes in wel doinge. Second, charitie is compared to a garment, for like as a garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth a man in external heat &amp; in colde, in wet &amp; drie wether, so doeth charitie award &amp; defend the soule in prosperitie, &amp; in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie. For as s. Paule saith, <hi>Diligentibus deum omnia cooperantur in bonu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> To them that loueth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> God, al thinges worketh to good, &amp; for both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie &amp; aduersitie God is to be lauded &amp; than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, when al thinges that man liueth by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tifully, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fruites of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth proueth lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gely, when God maketh the sonne to shine vpon good &amp; bad men indifferently, and sendeth rayne to the iust men as to the vniust, these and such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pertaine to temporal lyfe &amp; prosperitie, &amp; he that wil not loue god &amp; laud him for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is very vnkind, By this almighty god sheweth what he reserueth and kepeth in stoore for them that be good, whyle he geuethe all suche pleasures to theym that be noughte. Then yf thou haue plentye, thanke GOD that gaue it thee, or yf
<pb facs="tcp:12050:277"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> thou lacke, yet thanke God, for he is not taken from the, that geueth all thinges, thoughe his gyftes be withdrawen for a time. Remember what holy Iob sayde, when he was spoyled of al that he had. <hi>Dominus dedit, dominus abstulit, sicut domino placuit ita factum est sit nomen domini be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictum.</hi> This is verye true charitie towarde God, that so laudeth God in prosperitie, that yet it kepeth a man vp, that he be not broken nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowen in aduersitie. And here is hyghlye to be considered the true sentence and mynde of holy Iob, concerninge prouidence, cure, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision about thinges longinge to man, whiche many of the paignim philosophers imputed to desteny, or to fortune, or to influence of the ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> or suche other causes. For Iob sayth: <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus dedit,</hi> GOD hath geuen it to me. Where he confesseth that worldly prosperitie commeth to man, not by chaunce nor by desteny, nor by influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the sterres, nor onely by mans studye and laboure, but of Gods dispensation &amp; disposinge. And in that he sayth, <hi>Dominus abstulit,</hi> God hath taken it away, he confesseth that aduersitie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to man also by Goddes prouidence: mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge by this, that man hath no iust cause to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine or grudge against God, if he be spoyled of al temporal goodes &amp; gifts. For the things that God geueth, <hi>gratis,</hi> without any deseruing of vs, he may geue them for a time, or els to a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s last ende, as it pleaseth him. Therefore when he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them away afore our end, or when we haue most nede of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there is no cause why we shuld
<pb n="ccxl" facs="tcp:12050:277"/>
complaine. And when holy Iob sayth: <hi>Si cut domi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> placuit, ita factum est, sit nomen domini benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum,</hi> He declareth, that considering that if a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be spoyled of all that euer he hath, yet if he loue God, he shuld conforme his wil to Gods wyll, &amp; so not to be supped vp or ouercome with sorow, but rather to be glad, &amp; to geue thankes to God y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it hath pleased him to fulfil his will vpon hym, as the apostles did, <hi>Ibant gaudentes a conspectu consilii quoniam digni habiti sunt pro nomine Iesu contumeliam pati,</hi> they went from afore the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, nother wepynge nor grudginge, but with a mery heart, that it had pleased GOD to repute the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> worthy to suffre despites for Christes name, and for his sake. As if a sicke man take a bytter potion, he should be glad so to do, in hope of helth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that he trusteth to receiue by the medicine. And so, if God visit his louer with aduersitie, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les it is for some better purpose, that he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth better then we. Therfore, although the flesh woulde grudge, yet reason shoulde be contente &amp; glad of it. Thyrd, like as a garment couereth a mans secretes and vncleanly partes that a man would not haue sene, so doth charitie couer the vnclenlines of the soule, so that withoute it the soule goeth naked. Therfore it is sayd. <hi>Apo. xvi. Beatus qui vigilat &amp; custodit vestime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ta sua ne nudus ambulet, &amp; videa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t turpitudinem eius.</hi> Blessed is he that walketh as one regarding &amp; caring for his owne saluation &amp; sauegard, and that kepeth his raiment of vertues, lest he walke naked at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day of the generall iudgement, that all the aungelles
<pb facs="tcp:12050:278"/>
&amp; holy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ may se his filthi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Fourth, Charitie is the wedding liuery or garment, without which no man can be alowed to sit at Christes feast, but if he presume to come without it, he shall be taken vp, and bound hand and fote, and cast into the darke dongeon of hel. It is written. <hi>Hester. iiii.</hi> that it was not lawfull for any man to entre into the court of kinge As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suerus, beynge clothed in sackclothe, or such vile rayment. <hi>Assuerus</hi> by interpretation is as muche to saye as <hi>beatitude,</hi> so it maye not be, that anye man withoute charitie, beynge as one wrapt in a sacke, or vyle ragges of vices, to come into the courte of euerlastinge beatitude in heauen. This is the heauenlye vertue, by whiche mortall men yet here liuinge, be made lyke the inhabitauntes of heauen. Of this vertue it is written. <hi>Can, viii. Valida sicut mors dilectio,</hi> Loue or Charitie, is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> mightie and stronge as death. The strength of Charitie coulde not haue ben more nobly expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. For who can resist or withstande death? Fyre may be withstanden, weapons may be withstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, kynges and men of greate power maye be withstanden: but when death commeth it selfe alone, who resisteth or withstandeth it?

Heb. xiii.</hi> Forget not hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie, for by hospitalitie some men haue pleased angels that they receiued into their houses, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che they thought first to haue bene men, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde they perceiued that they were angels appearyng to theim in the likenes of men. Such <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> were they that appered to Abraham in Mambre when they tolde him that Sara his wife shoulde beare him a childe to be his heyre. And such were they that appered to Loth in Sodom, and bade him auoide out of that towne, for it should forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with be destroyed. Uppon which saith <hi>Origene</hi> Loth dwelled in Sodome, we reade not manye good dedes of his, hospitalitie onely is praysed in him, he scapeth the flames, he scapeth the fires for that onely that he opened his house to gestes and straungers. The angels entred the house where hospitalitie was kept. The fire entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the houses that were shut vp againste gestes.
<pb facs="tcp:12050:280"/>
But all men be not like disposed to hospitalitie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> for some men <hi>Hospitem velut hostem vitant &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludunt.</hi> They shun &amp; shut out a gest as thei wold an enemy. Let them beware of the fire with the Sodomites. Some other be liberall and kepeth good houses, but it is for some corrupt intente, either because thei can not be mery without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions and good companye, and so they do it to please them selues, which commeth of carnalitie. Some other doth it of pride and vaine glorye, or for some temporall profite or aduauntage. As <hi>Tully</hi> the noble oratour comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth hospitality, but his motiue and consideration is nought, it is to worldly. He saith <hi>.ii. offi.

citie and countrey men. This is a worldly policy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of the worldly prudence that I spoke of afore. And as S. Ambrose saith. <hi>super Luk. xiiii. Hospitalem remuneraturis esse, est affectus auariciae.</hi> To be a great housholder or viander lokinge for acquitall, or for to be recompenced with as good or better againe, is the affect or desire of auarice, rather then of liberalitie. And therfore our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christe declaryng to vs the verye true li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall hospitalitie of the Gospel, in the said .xiiii. chapter of Luke. <hi>Cum facis prandium aut coenam, noli vocare amicos tuos, ne<expan>

For though of hospitalitie come great rewarde temporall, and increase, yet that is not the thing that we muste loke for, nor intende to haue, least when we haue that we lose all the other. Of the reward for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitalitie, there be in scriptures many gaye exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples whiche seming temporall, yet signifieth the spirituall impinguation and feading, and profite of the soule. I read <hi>.iii. Reg. xvii<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> of the blessed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Helye,</hi> that on a time as he came towarde a towne called <hi>Sarepta sidoniorum,</hi> within the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory of <hi>Sidon,</hi> he found a woman gatheringe a few stickes to make her a fire, he desiered her to geue him a little water to drinke, and a morsel of bread. She answered and said she had no bread. I haue no more (said she) but a handfull of meale in a steen, and a litle oyle in a gearre, &amp; I gather nowe (saide she) <hi>duo ligna,</hi> two stickes, as a man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> woulde saie, a fewe stickes to bake it, and make breade for my sonne and me, and when we haue eaten that, we haue no more, we will dye. No (saide <hi>Helye</hi>) be not afraied. Thus saith the God of Israel. Thy steen of meal shal not faile or lack nor thy gearre of oyle shall be any thing lesse, tyll the time when GOD shall sende rayne vpon the earth. For in dede this fortuned in the time of the lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g famine that was in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey for lack of rayne, by the space of three yeres &amp; an halfe (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordynge to the prayer and peticion of the same Prophete <hi>Helye,</hi> for the correction and punishe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Achab the kyng, and Iesabel his quene,
<pb n="ccxlix" facs="tcp:12050:281"/>
and of their false prophetes, and of their people. And as the Prophete promised, so it proued in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> dede. By this example, you se howe the pore ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitalitie of the saide good woman exhibited and bestowed on Helye, was recompensed with plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie sufficiente, where all the countrey els was in greate penurye and neade. And here you shall note that this meale in the Steen that was so longe reserued and continued by the word of the Lorde God of Israell, was a figure, and signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the most reuerende and blessed Sacrament of the Aultare. The wydowe that was so longe susteined with this meal, signified Christes holy church, the whole congregation of faythful men and womenne, whiche by that that Christe her spouse and husband was slayne and buried, and then rose again, and departed from her into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and hath left her viduate and without hys <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> visible presence, althoughe he hath left her hys blessed bodye and bloude in this blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whiche this wydowe all faiethfull folkes muste bake and digest with the sayde two trees, signifiynge the remembraunce of his paynefull passion that he suffered on the crosse (for a crosse is made commonlye of two trees,) acccordynge to Sainte Paules saiynge. As oft as you shall eate this breade, or drinke of this cuppe, you shal shewe the death of our Lorde vntill he come, and shall shewe him selfe in his glorious maiestie at the generall iudgemente, which tyme thoughe it shall be a terible and an horrible time to sinners, and to all damnable persons, yet it shal be a time
<pb facs="tcp:12050:282"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of grace, of solace, and comfort to al his true &amp; lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng seruauntes. This was signified by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> raine that came from Heauen vppon the earth, when Helye sayde that the Steen of meale should not fayle, nor the gearre of oyle shoulde not be dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, tyll GOD sende rayne from heauen for the comforte of the countrey, as his grace shall come for the comfort of vs all, at that daye. This meale and Oyle were continued so longe to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine .iii. persons, not by any natural power, but by the supernatural power of God. And so is his bodye made of breade and wine by the worde of Christe, and by his Godlye and infinite power, aboue nature. Therefore let not naturall reason cumber it selfe in the examination or triyng how it maye be, but stedfastlye beleue that thus it is, for so God saith. And although it be called bread and the cuppe of wine, as well in the Gospell, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of S. Paule, yet there is nother bread nor wine after the consecration, but very fleshe and bloud. Tell me how a handful of meale and a little oyle coulde continue so longe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to feade so manye persons, and I shall tell thee, howe of a little breade and wyne shall be made a perfect body of a manne and hys bloude. Thou canst saye no more to the firste question but <hi>Hec dicit do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus Deus Israell.</hi> As Helye sayde. <hi>Thus sayth the GOD of Israell.</hi> and thus it was in dede.

<pb n="cclix" facs="tcp:12050:282"/>
so it is, and muste neades be so in dede. And so shall continue <hi>Donec veniat,</hi> vntyll he come to the generall Iudgemente in his visible maiesty,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> amonge vs. And then shall cease this blessed Sacramente, in whyche for the tyme wee see Christes bodye enigmatically, and in a strau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge similitude by our fayeth, whiche maner of seinge hym shall then cease, when we shall see him face to face in hys owne likenesse, when he shall cast downe and treade vnder his feete all theim that nowe so despitefullye rayle, and geste, and mock his blessed bodye that he hath left vs in this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Sacramente, for our comfort. And nowe to returne to the storie. In processe of tyme, it chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that the sayde good wydowes childe dyed, to her great discomforte.

And so the Prophete did, the chylde reuiued, &amp; the Prophete gaue him to his mother aliue agayne. Loe, here was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other notable recompence for hospitalitie exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this good man. Firste the sauegarde of all their liues: seconde the raysynge of the chylde from death to life agayne. Likewise it is writ <hi>iiii. Reg. iiii.</hi> of the blessed Prophete Helise, that he vsed to resorte to an honest house in the towne of <hi>Suna,</hi> where a worshipfull woman maistresse of the house perceyuynge hym to be a holy man exhorted her husbande to make for the sayde Helise a Parloure wyth a bedde in it, and a table, and a cheare, and a place to set hys can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle on. And so thei did. The said prophet resorted
<pb facs="tcp:12050:283"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> thither diuers tymes and lodged in the same par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lour, and hadde good cheare on a time when he was minded to pay for his cheare. he bade <hi>Giezi</hi> his seruaunt to aske of her whether she had anye matters to do with the kinge, or with any of the counsaile, or with anye great man in the courte, or with the Capitayne in the Warres, that hee might be suter for her, and speake for her. She aunswered, that shee dwelled amonge her owne frendes and kinred: and neaded none of his helpe in any such matters. Then saide <hi>Giezi</hi> to his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, you must vnderstande that she hath neuer a childe, and her husbande is an aged man, as who should saie, it shuld be most comfort for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both if they might haue issue by your praier, wherupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Prophete promised her that she shoulde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue a sonne by a certayne daie that he appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and so she did to the great comfort of the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and of the wife. This was a notable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for their hospitalitie bestowed vpon their gest that holye Prophet. In processe of tyme the same childe fell sicke on a certayne disease that bego<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne with a feruent ache in his heade, and died vpon the same. Then this deuout mocher layed the corps of her dead childe vpon the bed where Helye the Prophete was wonte to lye in the parlour whiche (I tolde you) was made and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined for the Prophete: and she shut vp the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour dore vppon him, and gote an asse sadled, and toke a seruant with hir, and ridde with all spede to seke Helye. She found him in his house, in the hyll called <hi>Carmelus,</hi> and declared to him the
<pb n="cclxi" facs="tcp:12050:283"/>
chaunce of the deathe of her chylde, and prayed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> for healpe. He bade hys seruaunte <hi>Giezi</hi> take his staffe and runne a pace, and to laye the stasse vppon the chyldes face: and so he did, but <hi>Non erat vox neque sensus,</hi> He nother spoke nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eled, it woulde not healpe. The good woman feared so muche and woulde not depart from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete, but she would haue hym to come him self. He was contente so to do. And when he came to the Corps, he layde him selfe vpon the corpes, his mouthe vppon the childes mouthe, his eyes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the childes eyes, his handes vppon the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des handes, and so the chyldes flesshe began to waxe warme, and he yaned seuen tymes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened his eyes, reuiued, and liued. And Helye gaue hym to his mother agayne alyue, and so departed. Here these honest Uianders had dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> acquitall for their good cheare and hospita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie that they bestowed vppon this good man. It is also writ. <hi>Ioh. xi.</hi> that where Martha and Marye her sister hadde greate disconfort by the death of Lazarus their brother, their good geste our Sauiour Christe, whiche had manye times gentle interteinment with them, and wyth their brother Lazar then late departed, reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pensed them with the marueilous raysynge the said La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus to life againe after he had bene .iiii. dayes deade and buried. This myracle was to their great consolation and no small admiration to all the countrey. And it is writte in the Storye of my blessed patrone sainte Curthberte, in whose honoure my paryshe churche of Welles is dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb facs="tcp:12050:284"/>
where I am vicare, that when he was coso<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> or officer in the monastery (where he was) to whom it belonged to receiue &amp; entertayne strau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, he thinkynge that he hadde receiued to the Hostrye a poore way farynge man, and goynge about to prouide meate for him, perceiued after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde that he hadde receiued into his offyce an aungell, in the likenes of a man. And so I doubt not but many good christen menne haue bene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded for their hospitalitie: for Goddes power is not coarted, neither his gratitude any thinge lesse towarde manne nowe in the time of grace, then it was afore Christes incarnacion.

To this I saye that euangelicall hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie, the hospitalitie of the gospel that is prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and commaunded by Christe, requireth not multitude of dishes, nor delicat chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge of meats nor diuersitie of exquisite wynes or other drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> We reade of no such feasts that Christ came to. And the blessed Patriarche Abraham (whose hospitalitie is so greatly praysed) when he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the aungels into his house, he bade his wife Sara make haste to bake some breade vnder the asshe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or vnder a pan while he went to the hurde, and fet a yong calfe, and he sod them some veale, and serued them with sod veale, butter, &amp; milke. Here was their dinner. <hi>Gen. xviii.</hi> And Christes feastes that he was bid to, were but <hi>Manducare panem,</hi> but to eate some meate sufficiently to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steine nature and no more. And <hi>Chrisostome</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth to the saide scruple &amp; doubt in a certaine Homelie that he made in the laude and prayse of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
               <hi>Priscilla</hi> and <hi>Aquila</hi> for their gentle enterteining of S. Paule, of whiche it is writ. <hi>Act, xviii.</hi> and <hi>Rom. xvi.</hi> Thei were but pore, but their hart was good &amp; liberall. They were bold in Gods quarel, they feared no peryll, &amp; they had greate thought and studye to do good to others. And of that it came that they saued manye a one, and deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued well of manye. For the pompose riche men can not profite the churche and congregation of Christes seruauntes, as the poore men may, that haue a good harte and a good wyll. The ryche man hath many things that greueth him, &amp; much busines in his minde y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> letteth him to do ani good

But the pore man that lacketh all these things, is lyke a Lyon, fire commeth from him, he riseth and auaunceth him selfe wyth a gentle and bolde courage againste all men that be nought. He dothe all thynges wyth facilitye and easelye that maye do good to the churche, whether neade be that men shoulde be rebuked, reproued, or blamed for euill doynge or saiynge, or whether peryls, hatred, or emnity should be susteyned and borne for Christes sake. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> For he that once hath dispised this present lyfe, dothe easelye ouercome all other thinges that might put him to feare. But we (God healpe vs) for the loue that we haue to this transitory life, and ease, and for feare of losynge that little that we haue, be afrayed of our shadowe, and dare not speake nor loke in Gods cause, or in a cause of Iustice, but will be more readye to speake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynste hym that we knowe to be in the ryght, if we maye knowe that we shall please the great manne, or to haue our pleasure vppon hym, or to haue anye aduauntage by our doynge.

This adulterie and vnlawefull luste in hym was not domesticall or of housholde, but came sodainelye vpon him as a straunger, and sone after went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, as appeareth by his penaunce that he toke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> by and by, saiyng: <hi>peccaui domino,</hi> I haue sinned against god.

So blessed is he which after his offence whether it be by the flesh, or by the worlde hath grace to take repentance, and to do penance. For in such a person sinne is not of houshold, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a gest or a stranger.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> His vnlawefull luste maistred hym and kepte him vnder euen to hys ende, and as it is to bee feared, to the extreame peryll of hys soule. And so in others, when their customable synne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth to the ende, it is a shrewde signe that it raygneth, and is a Lorde or a kynge in them. All such co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mers and goers, whether they be as gests or as of housholde, muste be put out of the dores or els they wyll destroye their hoste that harbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them.

And this must be done <hi>sine murmuratione,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out murmure or grudgynge. For he that is libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or free and large of giftes with murmuryng &amp; grudgyng, hath not tre liberalitie, but lasheth out as for a cloke to couer &amp; hide his nigardnesse. and not without some priuy grefe in his hart for

As it is writ of the vnkind people of Israel. <hi>Num. xi.

Euen so they that geueth and yet groneth withal, semeth to be sorie for their goods, as lest they shold haue nothing lefte, or that their goodes should fayle, and be wasted and decay, if they should helpe the neady.

The iudgement beginneth in our lyfe time: for whiche you muste note, that the iudgement of God is of two maners: one is pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie and secrete, the other shall be manifest and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly knowen to all men and women. The fyrste is in this life, the other shalbe at the day of dome, and the generall iudgement. For almighty God will leaue no ill vnpunished, therfore in as much <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> as he sharpely wyll punishe sinfull persons with the intollerable paynes of hell, with the deuylles after this lyfe, he suffreth them to take their plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sure while they be here a while, and to leade a mery life in welth &amp; in prosperitie, but at a trise sodenly they be plucked awaye, and descendeth downe into hell to that vntollerable and eternall iudgement. And when God sendeth to such ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactours any paynes or trouble, they fret and chafe, rayle and grudge agaynste GOD, and in theyr rage dyeth, and beginneth theyr hell with paynes and sorowe here, that hereafter in hell shall continue for euermore, no tounge can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the sorowe and paynes that there shall be. But others that by suche strokes and correction as God sendeth them, be exercised for theyr pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
<pb facs="tcp:12050:298"/>
and be made better and better, &amp; taketh <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> them for a warning to conuert and amend their liues, such correction doth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> much good. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is written, <hi>Iob. v. Beatus homo qui corripi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur a domino,</hi> Blessed is the man or woman that is correct and punished of our lord God. And the reason is this, for if mannes correction maye be good and holesome then Gods correction muste nedes be much more holesome: for man knoweth not parfitly the maner and measure of holsome correction, neither is omnipotent to take awaye the punishment when it is ynoughe, or when he lyste<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor to do good and to ease a man in tyme conuenient: but God by his omnipotency, by that he is almightie, and knoweth all thinges, he kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth how much or how litle he maye punishe his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> childe and seruaunt, and he euer punisheth hym to do him good, either to trie him, and to proue his constauncy, or to make him amende his lyfe. For there is no man liuinge that can say he is all cleare, but that he hath sinned or done amisse: and many things that in our iudgement semeth to be iust and well done, yet in the iudgemente of God they may be nought. For man seith and iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth after the exterior apparaunce, but God seith the secretes of the heart, and al other circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>staun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And in as much as all mankinde was at the beginning iustly condempned for the offences of Adam, God will not easely deliuer vs from that malandre, neither from so greate a disease, which also maketh that sinnes be euer ready, and we e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer running headlong to them, but iustice &amp; good
<pb n="cclxxvi" facs="tcp:12050:298"/>
liuing is full of labour and payne, and is hard to come to, but that loue and charitie maketh that easy to them that loueth God, whiche to other is very painefull. And this is the occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> iudgement of God, by which he sendeth trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and paine to good men with the bad indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, for all haue sinned, and haue nede of gods glorious helpe. Some by the sayde payne &amp; trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that God sendeth, be exercised for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and to be made better by the same, suche as be good, as Iob, Tobie, and such lyke, others be warned for their conuersion and amendment of their liues, and other that contemneth the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge, it blyndeth toward their condempnation, as I sayd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now is the time that Goddes iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should begin at Gods house, the Church of Christ, the congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of good faithfull people,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> whiche must be exercised with paine and trouble to learne the way to glory and ioy euerlastinge, where reproued &amp; damnable perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, lead a mery life in welth and prosperitie, &amp; feleth no paine nor displeasure, but laugheth at other mens harmes and glorieth in nothinge more, then to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues riche of other mennes goodes, landes and possessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, to their euerlasti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g impouerishing. And if we shal yet more specially speak of the house of God, it is to be feared, lest euen like as Ezechiell the prophet saw in his visio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vi. aungels like me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with weapons in their handes to execute Gods vengeaunce on the reuersion &amp; leauinges of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; they had going afore the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one clothed in linnen, hauing a pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner &amp; inckhorne ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging at his back, which was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to make y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> signe of

such as preach &amp; teache, and tel you of the wyl of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> God. So euery way Gods stroke &amp; iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ginneth at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church, albeit s.

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And if a good ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shal scarsely and with much a do be saued, where shal the wicked &amp; common sinner appeare?

But the iust man, the good liuer, taketh payne and labours to auoyde from sinne, and to please God by vertuouse liuinge, and by doynge good workes, and it is not one days worke one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but he muste continue in well doynge, and in continuall battayle agaynst the deuil, the world, and the fleshe. It is no smale busines, but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall payne and sorowe, as S. Paule said, <hi>Actu<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> xiiii.

Therefore Saint Peter, because he would here teache preistes, he professeth him selfe to be a preist as they be, and therefore they shoulde be gladder to heare hym, and to folowe his doctrine.

Peter here professeth him selfe to be a preiste, and a preiste not made at all aduentures, as these leude ministers be made nowe a dayes of shoemakers, smithes, coblers, and clouters, as well maryed as single, but one taught &amp; brought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> vp vnder the prynce of preistes oure Sauyoure Christe, therefore they shoulde assure theim sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues that he woulde teache them nothinge but that shoulde beseme a preiste. And yet further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more to amplifie his auctoritie, he calleth hym selfe a wytnes of Christes passions and paynes that he suffred for vs. <hi>Testis Christi passionum,</hi> Thoughe all Christes lyfe were a verye passyon, and a time full of trouble, paine, and persecution, yet chiefly his passion begonne when he prayed on the banke besyde <hi>Gethsemani,</hi> in the mounte <hi>Oliuete,</hi> when he was in a marueilous ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that made him swete so sore, that the drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes fel from him like water mixt with bloude. Then came Iudas, and a traine with him of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> presidents souldiers, &amp; also of the bishops men, &amp; set hand vpon him, &amp; led him ful boistuously, first to Annas, then to Caiphas, that was <hi>pontifexan ni illius,</hi> then to Pilate, then to Herode, because al the world should wonder on him, as condemned by so many iudges, and none of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all speaking one word for his dispatching or acquiting. Then they brought him backe againe to Pilate which condemned him to death, partlye to stoppe the Iewes mouthes and their clamoure, partlye for fear lest he should haue bene accused to the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roure for lettinge one scape that toke vpon him to be a kinge, as the Iewes bore him on hande
<pb facs="tcp:12050:303"/>
that Christ did, as preparing or intending a com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>motion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> or rebellion agaynst the emperoure. Of all this processe Peter was <hi>oculatus testis,</hi> a wyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that sawe it with his eye, to his greate dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforte, payne and heauines, and specially af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the cocke had crowen thrise, when Christ loked backe vpon him, and so pearced his hearte with his looke, that he remembred what he had done deniynge his maister, that then furth he went and wept bytterly, and afterwarde by his preaching and teaching he testified the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of his passion, and of his glorious resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and ascention, and stickt neither for threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teninge, beating, nor imprisonment. This should make all them that woulde beleue on Christe to credite him, and to do as he bad them. Another <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> perswasion he expresseth, <hi>Qui et eius quae in futuro reuelanda est gloriae communicator.</hi> I am a Preist as you be, I am a witnes of Christes paines and passion which I saw with mine eyes, and thirde, I was partaker of his glory, which shalbe reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and openly shewed in time to come, meaninge the marueilous and glorious sight that he sawe at Christes transfiguration, of whiche S.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ordered Timothe &amp; him, euen so he taught them to promote and to geue orders to others. And as he expresseth there, <hi>Oportet Episcopum sine crimi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne esse.</hi> I wyll prosecute some pointes of Sainte Paules writinge to Titus in this matter, for it agreeth muche w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his like sayinge to Timothe. Fyrste he requireth that a preiste be <hi>sine crimine,</hi> without crime. A crime is more then a sinne, or a faulte, for it is a notable or a greate faulte, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to be accused and to be condempned. Some sinnes be lighter, and not dampnable, suche as it very harde for any man to escape. And therefore saied s. Iohn in his epistle <hi>.i. Io. i. Si dixerimus quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam pec.</hi> If we saie that wee haue no sinne, or no fault, we deceiue &amp; begile our selues, &amp; there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> is no truth in vs, specially of suche sinnes as the frailtie of man customablie falleth vnto, and can not well eschue them, whiche we call veniall sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. The wiseman speketh. <hi>Pro. xxiiii.

It is as much to saie, As a good man falleth ofte, and riseth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. The scripture calleth him a iust man, and yet saith that he falleth, by which it is plain that such fallinge destroyeth not his iustice, Therfore it must nedes be taken of such fallynge or fautes without which ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth not leade his life in this wretched world. By ignorance, by obliuio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or forgetting of duties vndone, bi surreptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or priuy crepinge of matters into mens mindes,

by necessitie, by fragilitie of the flesh euery daye,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> either willingly, or against our wills we offend, &amp; yet rise againe, so that such frailnes of the flesh of man hurteth not nor destroieth a mans iustice or righteousnes, if he be a iust man or a good ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> where contrary the wiseman saith there. <hi>Impij autem corruent in malum.</hi> Because that wicked persons neither good to God, nor good to man doth runne downe headlonge to yll, to sinne, and to damnation. So that when thei haue fallen by consent to sinne, penance, and repentance is laid aside and despised. And then must neades folowe eternall dampnation. Then to Saynte Iohns saiynge. <hi>Si dixerimus. &amp;c.</hi> Of veuiall sinnes it is plaine, for without suche we can not leade thys fraile life. And of deadlye sinne there is no man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that can certainely and surely knowe what case he standeth in afore god, and whether he be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thye hatred, or the loue of GOD, except it be by special reuelation, then a manne affirminge him selfe to be cleare and without sinne, shoulde pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to farre proudlye boasting him selfe of such sinceritie, purenesse, and holinesse, as he was not sure of, and by that in dede should be in the sinne of pride and presumption, and not cleare. Then when Saint Paule saieth that <hi>Titus</hi> should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote to be a Prieste, such as be without crime, that is to saye: suche as be without any enorme dete<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>table, and notorious faulte or vice, or sinne. <hi>Oportet enim Episcopum sine crimine esse.</hi> For a bishop must be without blot or blemish of crime
<pb facs="tcp:12050:309"/>
And that is it y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he saith to <hi>Timothe. i. Ti. iii.

And here is to be noted that euen now S. Paule spoke of the orderyng of priestes, and now by and by he telleth the same tale of bishops, sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng: A bishoppe must neades be without crime, wherfore you must note that in the apostles time a priest and a bishop were all one, euerye Bishop was a priest, and so he is yet in oure tyme, and euery priest was a bishoppe, as it is taken plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and proued by these words of saint Paul here. And this S. Ierome noteth in an epistle that he writeth <hi>ad euagrium,</hi> where he saith also that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde in processe of tyme, they vsed to chose <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> one to be preferred and made ouerseer and ruler ouer other, to auoyde scismes and diuisions in the churche, for feare lest euerye one inuentynge newe wayes and makyng partes, and drawyng a congregation after him, should breake the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the church. And such a one so elect and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, &amp; set in higher roume and state then the rest, they called <hi>Episcopum a superintendent,</hi> that is, a bishoppe, to take hede and ouersee the others. Euen lyke as if in the tyme of warre, the hooste beynge destitute, or wythout a capitayne, should chose a capitayne amonge theim selues, and call hym their Emperoure, or as if the Deacones shoulde chose one amonge theim selues, whome they knew to be circumspect, wise, and diligente, and woulde call hym an Archedeacon, or chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon, for what thinge is it that the Bishoppe

but a prieste dothe the same, excepte it be geuyng <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of orders, confirming of children, and some other consecrations and blessinges, which by common consent of the churche were geuen to the bishops office. Saint Augustine in an epistle that he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to saint Ierom agreeth to the same, saiyng: <hi>Quanquam secundum honorum vocabula, que iam ecclesie vsus obtinuit Episcopatus presbiterio maior sit, tamen in multis rebus Augustinus Iheronimo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor est.</hi> Although bi the termes of honour (which now the vse of the church hath goten) a bishop is greater then a priest, yet notwithstandyng in ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny thinges Augustine is lesse of reputation then Ierome, albeit Augustine were a bishop, and Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome but a priest. Wel then we must take it indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently as well of a bishop as of a priest, yea and also of a deaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

A priest also must not be proud, for a proud man thinking that his preferme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dignite of a priest, is more because of his excellencye and deseruynge, and because he thynketh hym selfe so necessary for the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, that the congregation hathe neade of hym, and can not be wythout hym, and so falleth to contempne and despyse others that be as good and better then hee, and by that falleth into the snares of the Deuyll. As Saynte Paule say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>De neophitis. i. Timo. iii.</hi> Where he woulde not haue hym promoted to be a Bishoppe or a Prieste that is a newe conuerse. As who should

How then can it be that the seruice of the spirite, by the grace of the new Testament should not be in glorie muche more? He calleth the ministration and seruice of the olde leuits &amp; priestes of Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses law, the ministration and seruice of death, bycause that Moyses lawe was the occasion of death of the soule, not of it self, but by the malice <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and yll will of man, whiche commonly laboreth and inclineth to the thing whiche is forbidden, &amp; so runneth headlonge to breake the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mentes of God, whiche be set forthe by Moyses law, and consequently to run headlong to death euerlasting. And also Moyses law is full of the comminations and threateninges of the death of the body, for the breakinge of it. He that ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered stickes on the holy daye was put to deth: he that missayde his father or mother, should die for it and such other.

If the ministration and seruice of death, whiche also is euacuate, abolished and gon, were had in glory and reuerence as it was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> in deede, as appereth by the storie now reher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, then muche more the ministration and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the spyrite of the new law and Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in whiche the holye spiryte of GOD is gyuen to faythfull people, whyche is also the seruice of loue, and of libertie of the soule, must needes be had in glory and in reuerence. For in comparyson of the glory of the lawe of the Gospel and of the law gyuen by Chryst, the former, glory, and clearenes of Moyses law, is not seen but vanysheth awaye, euen like as the light of the Moone or of the sterres, is hyd and sheweth not by the light of the son in a clere day.

For it was neuer sayd to any of them, whatsoeuer thou loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest on earth, shal be losed in heauen, whatsoeuer thou bindest on earth, shall be bounde in heauen. This bonde toucheth the very soule of men, and reacheth vp euen to heauen aboue, so that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the priest doth in this behalfe here beneth on earth, almighty God doth ratifie and alowe the same aboue in heauen, and he beyng the lord and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> mayster, doth aproue the sentence of his serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Now what maye a man call this els but that in maner al the power in heauen is committed and graunted to the priest, for Christ sayth, whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer sinnes you forgiue, thei be forgiuen, and who soeuer sinnes you restrayne or bynde, they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint &amp; bound.

into prison whom it pleased him, and to take him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> out of prison againe or ani other prisoner that he thought wel to do, such a man should be counted a marueilous man, and in great fauour with his souerayne and worthy to be highly estemed of all the realme. And it were a plaine madnes for anye man to despise such an auctoritye, euen so it were a manifest madnes to despise or litle regard that authoriti, without which we can not obtain our soule helth here in this world (saith Chrisostom) nor can obtaine the good promisses of the ioyes of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Here you must vnderstand Chrisostom that he speaketh of them that be of age and dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and hath time and oportunitie to vse the sacramentes which the priest ministreth. For no man can come to heauen, except he be regenerate by water and by the holy gost, and he that eateth not the fleshe of Christ, &amp; drinketh not his blood, can not haue life euerlasting.

The Iewes priestes of Moyses law had power, not to pourge &amp; clense the bodie from leprie of them that were infecte with the same disease, but rather to discerne &amp; iudge, whether men were purged or not purged from that disease, and yet was their priesthod, in hie estimacion and ambitiously desired, as appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red bi <hi>Chore, Dathan and Abyron,</hi> which for their obstinate and greedie desyre sanke into Hell, the earth opened and swalowed them vp, with all theyr confederacie.

Yet furthermore to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the nature of this vertue of Humilitie, you shall vnderstande that Humilitye in vs and in Christe, of whome, and by whom wee muste learne to be lowelye, is not in all poyntes after one maner in hym and in vs. For in vs humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litye
<pb n="ccciiii" facs="tcp:12050:326"/>
is a vertue that by hys offyce restrayneth and kepeth downe the appetite of manne frome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> inordinate desire of excellencys that a man hath not yet obteined, but as it were beynge content with the state that a man hath alreadye.

Now because there could be in Christ no such inordinate desire neither any excellency able to be desired aboue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which he had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually from the moment of his conception, yea, and by his Godhead euer afore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worlde was made, therfore humilitie in Christe was not after the first maner, but was in hym onelye after the other office of humilitie, by whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che he kept close his mighty power, &amp; euer shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> him selfe curteous, gentle, patient, and as an vnderlinge to euery man.

               <hi>Phil. ii.</hi> By humilitie you euery one must thinke an order better then you. Therfore it is not with out cause, that the apostle s.

And al thinges conside<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red, we haue no cause to be proude at al, but we haue manie causes to be lowlie consideringe our owne miserie, first how miserably &amp; how vncle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly we were gotten, &amp; as vnclenly borne, &amp; then how wretched we be in our education, nursing &amp; brin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ging vp, where euery beast by and by, as sone as he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth into the worlde can make some shyfte for him selfe to finde the teete or other kinde of feedynge, man canne make none suche shyfte but rather yf helpe were not, should forthwith perysh.

The Deuil the aucthor of these troubles, Saynt Peter byd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs resist by fayth, in whiche in verye deede as Saynt Paule sayeth in the last Chapter to the Ephesians. In all thinges takynge the shielde or buckeler of faythe, wyth whiche ye maye quenche all the firie Dartes or weapons of the moste wicked Deuyll. But Saynt Peter addeth and putteth to more then Saynt Paule doeth, exhortinge vs to be stronge in faythe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and by that to resist the fyrie Dartes of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacion, meanynge that many haue faythe, and yet they resiste not the Deuylles rorynge and fearce temptation, and because they be not <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes in fide,</hi> stronge in faythe, but verie weake in fayth, therefore they be sone ouerthrowne &amp; ouercome. And that is the cause that Heresies so muche preuayle amonge vs, and peruerteth and turneth the most parte of people, As sayth that greate auncient Father <hi>Tertullian libro de prescriptionibus contra hereticos.

<pb n="cccxi" facs="tcp:12050:333"/>
Heresies be of greate strengthe amonge them that be of no strengthe in fayth, or that haue no stronge faythe. He putteth an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of these tourneamentes, as fightyng wyth Battell Axes, or Iustinge at the Tylte, or at prouinge of mastries, as Wrestlynge or suche other. Not he that is mooste stronge, hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the best game, or hath the victorie, but is manie tymes ouercome of a verie wretche and of a weake man, and he that doeth ouercome, doeth not alwayes ouercome, because of hys owne strengthe, but because he mette wyth a wretche or with a weake manne, that had no strength. And therfore it proueth manie times, that he that nowe ouercame, when he shalbe afterward matched with a man of good stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth shall haue a foyle and be ouercome. So saieth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>

And should be of no strength, if they should matche or chaunce vpon a fayth that is myghtie &amp; stronge. Therfore yf you will resist the roring of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, and quenche the fyrie Dartes of the mooste wicked, you must doo it by faythe, and that by stronge faythe, for a faynte and a weake fayth will not be able so to doo. Howe many thynke you of this audience here present be there? A greate manie I am sure, that woulde haue sayd once within this twentie yeares, that no man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

Therfore I shal most hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie pray you that wilbe saued by your faith, ador<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned and decked with charitie, that you wyll be stronge in fayth, and not to folowe euerie puffe or blaste of new doctrine, that so you maye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue <hi>finem fidei vestrae salutem animarum vestra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.

And like as in the beginninge of this present chapter, he parswaded by exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of him self, the pastors, prelates, &amp; priestes: euen so now he exhorteth them that he write to, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the brotherhed or other faithful people to the sufferance &amp; perseueraunce in persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, saying: <hi>Scientes eandem passionem ei que in mu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do est vestre fraternitati fieri.</hi> Knowing that you haue the same passion and suffering in you, that hath be layde on your brotherhed.

Therfore consideringe that they stande stedfastly, it were shame for you that you should lyghtlie be ouerthrowen. And because that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen from the beginninge of the worlde, good men haue ben sauted, persecuted and tempted, and yet haue not ben ouerthrowen.

Then because there seemed to muche reuerence, to be giuen to the Sacrament by this waie, the people were al driuen out of the chauncell except the ministers, that the Communion should not be commonlye

And anone that way semed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> not best, and therfore there was veils or curtens drawen, yea and in some churches the very Lent cloth or veile ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged vp though it were with Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leluya in the Easter time to hide it, that no man should see what the prieste did, nor heare what he saide. Then this waye pleased not and the aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were pulled downe and the tables set vp, &amp; all the obseruaunce saide in Englyshe, and that openlye that all men might heare and see what was done, and the breade commaunded to bee common vsed breade leuende with salte, barme, and such other. And then sone after were all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraces taken awaye to extenuate the honoure of the sacrament, &amp; it laied down on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophane borde clothe.
