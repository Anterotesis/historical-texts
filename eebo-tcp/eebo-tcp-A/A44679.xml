            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb facs="tcp:45607:3"/>
Brother</hi> of a <hi>Family,</hi> whereof you were the <hi>genuine,</hi> or the <hi>ingraft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Branches.</hi> Whether <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Choice</hi> gave you your Interest, you had a <hi>common</hi> concern, and Comfort in it. And indeed, from a <hi>Love</hi> too little common to the rest of the World. <hi>The Love</hi> that hath so observably flourished among you, and been your <hi>Collective, Unitive Bond,</hi> as it hath shewn it self to be of an <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> than the <hi>Common, kind; demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated</hi> its own <hi>Divine Original,</hi> and that it had its <hi>root in Heaven;</hi> so have its effects <hi>been a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,</hi> what <hi>such a Love</hi> can do, for the Cherishing of <hi>Union,</hi> not only in a <hi>private Family,</hi> but in the <hi>Church, and Family of the Living God</hi> also. And how little necessary it is unto an <hi>Union, even
<pb facs="tcp:45607:3"/>
there,</hi> that there be a <hi>sameness</hi> of sentiments, and Practices in <hi>every little punctilio;</hi> for a disagreement wherein, too many have thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves licensed to hate, and even de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy one another. As <hi>God himself</hi> was the <hi>Fountain,</hi> so he was tbe <hi>first object</hi> of <hi>that Love</hi> with you. And as <hi>your Love to him</hi> caused your entire devotedness to his Interest, so <hi>your mutual Love</hi> united your Hearts (according to your several Capacities) in serving it; without <hi>grudging,</hi> or <hi>hard thoughts,</hi> that each one serv'd it not <hi>exactly in the same way.</hi> By <hi>that Love</hi> you have been undivided in your <hi>Joyes,</hi> and <hi>Sorrows</hi> in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to one another. While your very eminent <hi>Father</hi> Survived, how <hi>glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> did you pay a <hi>joint Reverence</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:45607:4"/>
and <hi>Duty</hi> to him! what a glory was his <hi>hoary Head</hi> unto you! <hi>This your worthy Brother</hi> was the next resort and center of your <hi>united</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, and delight. I doubt not you feel your <hi>loss</hi> as to both; which (thô God had made a former breach upon you) the <hi>longer continuance,</hi> as well as the pleasantness of the <hi>enjoyment,</hi> cannot but have made <hi>the more sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> unto you. We are somewhat apt to Plead <hi>a Prescription</hi> for our <hi>more continued</hi> Comforts. But you know how little <hi>that</hi> avails against a <hi>Statute,</hi> as that (for instance) by which <hi>it is appointed that all must dye:</hi> Nor is it to be regretted that the absolute <hi>Lord of all,</hi> should pluck in pieces our <hi>earthly Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi> for the Building and Compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:45607:4"/>
               <hi>his own in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What I have said of <hi>this your excellent Brother,</hi> in the close of the following Discourse, is but <hi>a small part of what you know.</hi> The saying it serves for the <hi>Solace of the Survivors, not the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Dead</hi>

            <epigraph>
               <q>
                  <bibl>MAT. XXV. 21.</bibl>
                  <p>His Lord said unto him, Well done good and faithful Servant, thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee Ruler over many things: enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IT may seem somewhat Incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and an indecency that this <hi>Memorial</hi> of our <hi>worthy Friend,</hi> should be now Solemniz'd so long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>his very remains</hi> are gone from off the face of the Earth. But two things concurr'd to make the delay necessary, and unavoidable, <hi>viz.</hi> That his own
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45607:6"/>
desire, exprest in his <hi>Will,</hi> limited the Performance of this Office to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son upon whom it now falls. And that my own great Infirmities, before the time of his Sickness and Death, (which made it more likely he should have done this part for me, than I for him) had obliged me to begin a course, for the repairing of languishing Health, which required some Weeks attendance abroad, and which could not be soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over.</p>
            <p>But, if our business were only to Mourn, and lament our own, and the more common Loss, it were not yet too late. The mention of his Name, <hi>The worthy Mr. Richard Fairclough</hi> is enough to Open fresh Springs, calling to remembrance such a <hi>Brother,</hi> such a <hi>Friend,</hi> such a <hi>Preacher of the Word of Life</hi> as he was.</p>
            <p>And it should do it most of all up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the most common account: whom would it not induce to Mourn over this forlorn World, to see that every thing that is more excellent, more pure, more desirable, more capable of being
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45607:6"/>
useful in it, God is gathering up out of it? O how much of Spirit and Life is gone from it, when one such man dies? how are we to mourn over the World as dying, gradually, the worst sort of Death, when the <hi>Holy, Divine life</hi> is thus exhal'd out of it, and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring by degrees?</p>
            <p>But come, we have somewhat else to do than Mourn; all this tends to make a glorious Heaven, one bright Star the more is now added to it; there is nothing of this holy Life lost; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever of Excellency, Purity, Goodness, Life, Loveliness, and Love <hi>of that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine kind</hi> vanishes from among us, is but transferr'd to its own native place, returns to its proper Element, as the forsaken Dust hath to its own. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hath its part out of every such Person, the seat of all Life, Purity, and Goodness; as the Earth draws into its Bosom its own terrene part, (not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Sacredness, and a rich Perfume adhering to that also.)</p>
            <p>And as it is not our only, or more principal business to Mourn, so nor is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45607:7"/>
it to relieve, and fortifie our selves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Mourning. We have somewhat to do, divers from them both, and that is more considerable than either of them. We are chiefly <hi>so</hi> to consider his Death, <hi>as</hi> may best serve the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses of our own yet-continuing Life, which was the scope of that desire of his signified by <hi>his Will,</hi> that <hi>an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Sermon might be</hi> (upon that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion) <hi>Preacht to the People.</hi> We are to set our selves to learn from it, what doth most concern our own <hi>daily pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi> and <hi>hope;</hi> So to acquit our selves as not to neglect <hi>the duty</hi> of <hi>good and faithful Servants</hi> to our common Lord, nor to come shott of <hi>their Reward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to this purpose we are more to consider his <hi>life</hi> than his <hi>death.</hi> The Life which he hath liv'd on Earth, and the Life which (we have reason not to doubt) he doth live in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>Nor could my thoughts reflect upon any portion of Scripture more fit for our purpose, or that was more sutable to <hi>him</hi> and <hi>us, i. e.</hi> that could more
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45607:7"/>
aptly serve to describe him, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct our selves; nor have I known any person to have left the World, within my time, to whom this Text of Scripture might more fitly be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd.</p>
            <p>I shall only observe and Insist up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these two Heads of Discourse from it,</p>
            <p>The <hi>Character</hi> of <hi>such a Servant.</hi> And,</p>
            <p>The <hi>Treatment</hi> which he finds at last from his <hi>Heavenly Master.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, His Character. He is said to have <hi>done well,</hi> or 'tis said to him <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>well,</hi> (no more is there in the Greek Text.) And then he is further bespo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as a <hi>good</hi> and <hi>faithful Servant, more generally,</hi> and <hi>particularly</hi> his <hi>fidelity</hi> is commended <hi>in reference to</hi> the special trust and Charge which is imply'd to have been committed to him: <hi>Thou hast been faithful in a few things</hi>; I have not over-charg'd thee, and thou hast acceptably discharg'd thy self.</p>
            <p>Some think <hi>this</hi> (and the whole Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable) to belong only to the Ministers
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45607:8"/>
of the Gospel, the Servants of Christ in that special sence. I do not see a reason for that restriction. The words are of themselves capable of being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended further, to the faithful Servants of Christ in whatsoever capacity; thô being spoken to the Disciples, as from the continuation of the Discourse (with this Evangelist) from the beginning of the foregoing Chapter may be Collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it seems not unfit to allow them a more particular reference to their spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Office and trust.</p>
            <p>And here we must note that these words of Commendation [<hi>Well done good and faithful Servant</hi>] do speak both <hi>the Truth of the thing</hi> and the <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and estimate</hi> which his Lord makes thereof accordingly.</p>
            <p>We are <hi>now</hi> to consider them under the <hi>former notion,</hi> as they express <hi>the truth of the thing,</hi> the <hi>matter of Fact,</hi> whereof we cannot have a more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain account, than (as here we have it) from <hi>his Mouth,</hi> who imploy'd him, was his constant Supervisor, must be his final Judge, and will be his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Rewarder at length.</p>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>One that hath Disclaimed all former and other Masters:</hi> All in Coordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for <hi>of such, no man can serve two: Other Lords had Dominion</hi> over him, but by <hi>their Vsurpation,</hi> and <hi>his unjust Consent,</hi> who was not his own, and had no right to dispose of himself. The faithful Servant Repents, and retracts those former engagements, as Bonds of Iniquity, by which he will be no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er held, renounces any former inconsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Master</hi> or <hi>Service:</hi> A <hi>truly subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Master</hi> he must own for the same reason upon which he acknowledges the Supream, and do all that such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived Authority challenges, by his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection who gave it; <hi>Otherwise,</hi> he hath learned <hi>to call no man Master on Earth.</hi>

            <p n="2">
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:45607:9"/>2. <hi>He is one that hath by Covenant surrender'd and resign'd himself to this great Lord and his Service:</hi> Some <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> have their foundation in Nature; <hi>this</hi> of <hi>Servants</hi> to a <hi>Master,</hi> (we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Slaves) in their Consent, or in mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual contract; and thô this <hi>general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> have the most <hi>deeply natural foundation</hi> imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, whereupon <hi>all are his Servants;</hi> yet the <hi>special Relation</hi> must have the <hi>other ground, viz.</hi> That of <hi>Consent,</hi> or <hi>Contract</hi> superadded; not to give God a <hi>right to our Service,</hi> but more expresly and effectually to <hi>oblige our selves</hi> to it, and that <hi>we may have a right to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</hi> 'Tis but acknowledging and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognizing his <hi>former Right</hi> in us, which is part (<hi>and the initial part</hi>) of our Duty to him. He requires and justly insists upon it, to be acknowledged as our only rightful Lord; which till we do, we are in Rebellion against him, and in the Condition <hi>of Servants broke away from their Masters, Run-aways,</hi> Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitives, and who keep our selves out of the Family; and thô <hi>that</hi> cannot,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45607:9"/>
however, destroy <hi>his Right,</hi> yet it is inconsistent with <hi>our Duty,</hi> for our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice must be throughout voluntary, and <hi>with our Reward,</hi> for nothing that is not voluntary, is Rewardable. Therefore the <hi>good and faithful Servant in</hi> the Text, is one that affects and chooses <hi>the State,</hi> first, and sayes with the Psalmist (<hi>Psal.</hi> 119.38.) — <hi>Thy Servant who is devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to thy Fear:</hi> And (<hi>Psal.</hi> 116.16.) <hi>Oh Lord, truly I am thy Servant, I am thy Servant, the Son of thy Hand-maid; thou hast loosed my Bonds.</hi> He doth as is required, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.13, 19. <hi>Yields him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to God,</hi> and all his parts and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers <hi>Servants of Righteousness unto Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> He reckons it neither <hi>Dutiful to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God,</hi> nor <hi>Comfortable to himself,</hi> to do him only <hi>occasional Service,</hi> but <hi>ad libitum,</hi> and as an <hi>unrelated Person:</hi> He thinks it not Honourable to the great Lord of Heaven and Earth but to <hi>Borrow</hi> (as it were) <hi>anothers Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> nor can he satisfie himself, <hi>not to be of the Family,</hi> therefore he consents first to the Relation, and enters him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self his <hi>Covenant-servant. Faithfulness</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:45607:10"/>
supposes <hi>having Covenanted,</hi> and hath the same reference to <hi>our part of the Covenant,</hi> that <hi>Gods faithfulness hath to his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>He is one that hath thereupon made it his earnest Study to know his Lords will:</hi> His first enquiry is, <hi>What wilt thou have me to do, Lord?</hi> he is solicitous to understand the Duty of his Station, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.125. <hi>I am thy Servant, give me Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, that I may know thy Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies:</hi> To enter one's self the Servant of another, without any concern to know the business of his place, shews an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sincere mind, and argues he hath more a design to serve himself upon his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, than to serve him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>He is one that hath an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the work he is to do when he knows it,</hi> a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, an inclining bent of mind to it. <hi>That</hi> which the <hi>Scripture</hi> means by <hi>having the Law of God written in the heart.</hi> Spoken of our Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in reference to that peculiar Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice he was to perform. <hi>Lo I come to do thy will, O God, thy Law is in my heart.</hi> Psal. 40.8. Who thô <hi>he were a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45607:10"/>
Son,</hi> yet taking the <hi>form of a servant,</hi> apply'd himself to that severe part as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd him, <hi>with a most willing mind;</hi> and had, hereupon, the highest appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation imaginable. <hi>Isa.</hi> 42.1. <hi>Behold my servant whom I uphold, mine Elect in whom my Soul delighteth.</hi> And it is spoken of all the <hi>inferiour true servants</hi> of God besides, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. <hi>I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts.</hi> 'Tis the <hi>same thing</hi> with being <hi>Gods workmanship,</hi> (Ephes. 2.10.) <hi>created unto good works</hi>; and with that <hi>readines</hi> to every good work, (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,) <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.1. If a mans heart be not so framed to Gods Service, how awkward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and untowardly, does he go about any thing that is enjoyn'd him, he is habitually <hi>disobedient, and to every good work reprobate.</hi> Tit. 1.14.</p>
            <p>Secondly, And for <hi>that part of the Character,</hi> which <hi>being a good and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful servant,</hi> includes</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>He is one that endeavours to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his obedience to the whole compas of his duty</hi>; hath an universal respect <hi>to all Gods commandments.</hi> Is not <hi>partial in the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:45607:11"/>2. <hi>He peculiarly minds the work most, of his own station.</hi> Thinks it not enough, or possible, to be a good Christian, and at the same time an ill Magistrate, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, Parent, Master of a Family, or Servant in it, if it be his lot to be in any of these capacities.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>He is diligent</hi> in all the Service that belongs to him any way; <hi>not slothful in business, fervent in Spirit, serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord,</hi> Rom. 12.11.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>He is with most delight exercised in the most spiritual part of his work.</hi> In the great, vital acts, of <hi>faith, love, self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devoting,</hi> and those most immediately proceeding from them, <hi>meditation, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> and <hi>praise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>He balks not the most hazardous or more costly part.</hi> Thinks it mean to serve God at no expence, or with what costs him nothing. Measures not his duty, by the advantage, or safety of his own secular Interest. So as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline it when nothing is to be got by it, or if any thing be in danger to be lost.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>He grudges not that others are less
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45607:11"/>
expos'd to danger in their work, than he.</hi> And have that liberty of serving God which he hath not.</p>
            <p>Let me seriously recommend this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty and Disposition of a faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to my Brethren in the Ministry. While <hi>some</hi> have Opportunity of serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our great and common Lord with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear of the interruption and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to which <hi>we</hi> are liable, and when we have reason to judge they do it with sincerity (thô we may think they gained their greater liberty by their mistake) there can be no more genuine expression of our <hi>fidelity,</hi> and <hi>sincere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votedness</hi> to our Masters Interest, than <hi>to behold, with complacency,</hi> all the good which we observe done by them. If the great Apostle <hi>rejoyced,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 1.15, 16, 17, 18.</note> and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>he would rejoyce</hi> that <hi>Christ was preached, thô not sincerely (and whether in pretence or truth</hi>) much more should we, when we ought to judge that he is sincerely preached. And if he envy'd not those that preached Christ even <hi>of envy,</hi> How horrid would it be, should we behold with envy, what we are
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45607:12"/>
to suppose done <hi>out of love, and good will.</hi> They are great admirers of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and lovers of some Interest of their own more than his, that cannot endure to see his work done by other hands, than theirs. Or that have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that disposition in them which those words expresse, <hi>Let him increase and me decrease.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. He is much less apt to <hi>smite his fellow-servants,</hi> or hinder them in their work, unles they will work by <hi>his rule and measure,</hi> unprescribed by their Lord himself. He takes no pleasure to see the hands ty'd up of useful <hi>Labourers in the harvest,</hi> wishes not their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber diminisht, but because <hi>the harvest is really plenteous, but the labourers are few, rather prayes the Lord of the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest to send forth labourers into his har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest.</hi> Mat. 9.37, 38.</p>
            <p>If any of their own private Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would have the <hi>necessary work</hi> of their Lord hindered, and take Pleasure in the exclusion of industrious Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, for their conscientious disuse of things, <hi>by their own Confession, not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:45607:12"/>
Good Lord! <hi>What Spirit are they are of?</hi> I understand it not; nor <hi>Let my Soul enter into their secret!</hi> I had rather a thousandfold <hi>bear their Anger,</hi> than <hi>be of their Spirit!</hi> Would any faithful Servant rather wish his Masters work should be in any part undone, than done by those he dislikes, upon no more important reason than that their Cloaths perhaps are not of the same colour with his?</p>
            <p>But thanks be to God that among those that differ from each other <hi>in the lesser things</hi> there are so many that rejoyce, being under restraints them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, for the Liberty of others, and that mourn, while they enjoy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves an ample Liberty, for others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straints, and among whom there is no other contention, but who shall think, and speak, and act, with most kindness towards one another: And that <hi>not whole parties,</hi> but an ill mind and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit <hi>only in some Persons,</hi> can be charg'd with what so much unbecomes faithful Fellow-servants.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>He is less at leasure to mind what
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45607:13"/>
others do or do not, than what he is to do himself.</hi> Is above all things solicitous <hi>to prove his own work, that he may have rejoycing in himself, and not in another,</hi> Gal. 6.4.</p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>He esteems the utmost he can do but little</hi>; and counts <hi>when he hath done his best, he is an unprofitable Servant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. <hi>He approves himself in all that he doth to the eye of his great Master.</hi> Here we cannot serve too much with Eye-service, or be too apprehensive of the constant Inspection of our heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Lord. One may be too much a pleaser of Men, but no man can too much Study to please, and approve himself to the eye of God.</p>
            <p n="11">11. <hi>He laments lost time,</hi> and labours to redeem it.</p>
            <p n="12">12. <hi>He greatly rejoyces in the success of his Work.</hi> If, for instance, it be his business to bring home Souls to God, nothing is more grateful to him than to prosper in it. <hi>My Beloved, my Joy, and my Crown,</hi> — (Philip. 4.1.) So he counts such as he can make Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes to Christ: <hi>I have no greater Joy,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45607:13"/>
than to hear that my Children walk in truth:</hi> Joh. 3.4. 'Tis said of <hi>Barnabas, (a great number believing and turning to the Lord,)</hi> Acts 11.22, 23. that, <hi>When he saw the Grace of God, he was glad; For</hi> ('tis added) <hi>he was a good Man, and full of the Holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">13. <hi>He loves his work and his Master,</hi> is willing to have his Ear bored and serve him for ever. If any thought arises of changing, he presently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses it by some seasonable check, and counter-thought <note n="†" place="margin">As Holy Mr. <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert.</hi>

                     <l>Some other Master out.</l>
                     <l>Ah my dear God! tho' I be clean forgot,</l>

               </note>, and confirms his Resolution of cleaving to him unto the end.</p>
            <p n="14">14. <hi>He puts the highest value upon such present encouragements from his Lord, as are most expressive of peculiar favour.</hi> The blessed God knows what is most suitable to the <hi>Genius</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of his own <hi>New Creature:</hi> They who are his <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Servants,</hi> are his <hi>Sons</hi> too, born of him, and to the divine and heavenly Nature in them, those things are most

            <p>Concerning this <hi>Judgment</hi> we are to note, both what it <hi>supposes,</hi> and what it <hi>includes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It <hi>supposes</hi> both an <hi>account</hi> taken how this Servant demean'd himself, and a <hi>Rule</hi> according whereto the matters to be accounted for, were to be examin'd and judg'd of.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That our Lord calls his Servants to an account</hi>; so we find it <hi>expresly said</hi> vers. 19. <hi>After a long time, the Lord of those Servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.</hi> And <hi>here</hi> 'tis <hi>imply'd,</hi> when he

sayes, <hi>Well done</hi>— it implies he takes Cognisance, and enquires whether they have done well or ill, he is not indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent or regardless how they quit and behave themselves; nor doth he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce rashly, and at randome, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out searching into the matter. <hi>So then every one of us shall give an account of himself to God,</hi> Rom. 14.12.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That there is <hi>some certain stated Rule,</hi> by which their doings must be measured. <hi>Well doing</hi> stands in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to some Rule or other; and what is the <hi>next</hi> and most immediate <hi>rule</hi> of <hi>our Duty,</hi> is also the <hi>rule</hi> of <hi>Gods Judgment: Such a Rule</hi> it must suppose as according whereto <hi>a true Judgment is possible,</hi> of <hi>our having done well.</hi> That cannot be the <hi>Law of works,</hi> according whereto <hi>no flesh can be Justified in his sight,</hi> It must therefore be the <hi>Law of Grace:</hi> And so <hi>this Servant</hi> is only said to have <hi>done well</hi> according to the <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45607:15"/>
               <hi>Well doing</hi> arises out of the concurrence of all requisites; Evil from any the least defect; and so indeed whatever the rule be, all things must concur that are requisite to acceptance by that rule. But here <hi>simply every thing of Duty</hi> is requisite; so that the <hi>condition of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance and life</hi> was not to be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisht (as a thing of less latitude) from <hi>meer Duty</hi> in its utmost extent. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.10. <hi>For whosoever shall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Well-pleasedness: <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="1">1. How blessed a thing is it to be a faithful Servant of Christ! if any have not yet learnt to value his service <hi>for it self,</hi> let them make their estimate <hi>by the end of it,</hi> and by what is even at present most certainly annexed to it. <hi>To be accepted with him!</hi> to appear gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in his eyes!

               <hi>and uttered words to him grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to his Heart, saying, Well done, O thou good and faithful servant,</hi> &amp;c. What can be more grateful and revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to the heart of a good man, than that the glorious Lord of Heaven and Earth should say to him, <hi>Well done?</hi> To have him say to us as to <hi>Moses, Thou

hast found Grace in my sight,</hi> Exod. 33.12. <hi>To have gained this Testimony,</hi> as <hi>Enoch</hi> did, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.5. <hi>That we have plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God</hi>; and that our Case might true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admit of such an Angelical Saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (thô upon a less peculiar account) <hi>Hail thou that art highly favoured?</hi> how great a thing is it! So great a thing in the Apostles account, that living or dying, <hi>being in the body</hi> or <hi>out of the body,</hi> seem'd little things to him in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of it: <hi>He was willing rather to be absent,</hi> but is more solicitous <hi>whether present or absent, that he might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of him,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.8, 9. Yea, and the more abject spirit of a very <hi>Cain,</hi> resents so deeply his <hi>not being accepted,</hi> tha<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> his troubled mind imprints Characters of Sorrow in his Face, shews it self in a fallen Countenance, and dejected looks.</p>
            <p>What ingenuous mind but knows how to value, even the (unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) kindness of a mean Friend: Can the Love of a God seem little with us? it addes greatly to the value of meer Kindness, abstracted from Beneficence,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:45607:19"/>
if it be born me by a judicious, wise person, such a one honours whom he loves; we less esteem the love of a Fool; there can be no greater contempt of God, than to make light of being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted with him.</p>
            <p>But how transporting a thing should it be, besides the present sence of such acceptance, which (with more or less expresness) accompanies diligence and fidelity in his Service, to have it judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially declared with solemnity, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly said to us, before Angels and men, <hi>Well done good and faithful Servant?</hi> when so great consequences depend and are to ensue upon it; as that it should be further said, <hi>Come, be thou Ruler over many things, Inherit the Kingdom prepared for you</hi>; Enter into the Joy of your Lord. Who would think mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of being the accepted Servant of the most high God? They that finally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise so Priviledg'd a State, will see it with their eyes, (exemplifi'd in others) but shall never tast the sweetness of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How easily accountable is it why
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45607:20"/>
our Lord lets his Servants suffer hard things in this World a while? <hi>He</hi> may permit it to be so, who hath it in his Power <hi>to make their Sorrow be turn'd into Joy:</hi> It is not strange if <hi>Weeping endure with them for a night,</hi> unto whom such <hi>Joy is coming in the morning</hi>; it is unworthy to repine in this Case. 'Tis want of foresight that makes any won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and censure. Consider well those weighty words, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.12, 13. <hi>Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial, which is to try you, as thô some strange thing happened unto you; But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, in as much as ye are partakers of Christs sufferings, that when his Glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. How wicked and foolish a thing is it to refuse this Service? 'tis horrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unjust towards our most rightful Lord, and most imprudent for our selves: Do men know what they do in this? whose right they invade and resist? and what Cruelty they use towards their own Souls?</p>
            <p n="4">4. How much to be lamented is the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:45607:20"/>
condition of the sinful World, who so generally decline this Service, and make themselves Slaves in the mean time to the worst of Masters? how do men drudge to the Devil? what Slaves are they to themselves and their own vile Lusts? As indeed no man serves him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but hath a Fool and a mad Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant (as one well sayes) for his Master. We do not enough live up to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of our Religion, while we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not with more compassion the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of infatuated Mankind in this respect.</p>
            <p n="5">5. What may be expected by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful negligent Servants that hide their Talent in a Napkin? The others Joyes serve to measure their Sorrows; what a killing word will it be, when instead of <hi>Well done good and faithful Servant,</hi> it shall be said, <hi>Thou wicked and slothful Servant!</hi> and instead of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thou into the Joy of thy Lord,</hi> they must hear and feel, <hi>Cast ye the unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Servant into outer darkness, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth,</hi> (vers. 30.)</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:45607:21"/>6. See what estimate we are to make of the <hi>nature of God,</hi> especially of his <hi>large, munisicent goodness</hi> (which is his nature, <hi>God is love</hi>:) For consider the various emanations and discoveries of it, which may here be taken notice of.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That he should seek to have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for servants (which the text suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth that he doth) in this world of ours: A world of Apostate, Degenerous, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, Impotent creatures, disaffected to him and his Government, hating him, and (as in themselves they are) hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him. He who hath so little need of servants for any real use! who can do all things with a word! And if he thought it fit to have them for state, and as a thing becoming his majesty and greatness, is attended, above, by so excellent God-like Creatures! So suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and obsequious! So powerful and agile! <hi>Those ministers of his that do his pleasure, hearkening to the voice of his word.</hi> A World of ministring Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits that might be used for purposes less kind to us than they are! That he
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:45607:21"/>
should seek Servants among us! (for his having them implies it, who ever serv'd him unsought unto?) invite men into his service with so importunate solicitation! whom he might despise for their vileness, and destroy for their rebellion, which he can in a moment! And that he should seek <hi>such</hi> to become his Servants, not with indifferency, but with so great earnestness! and use af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards so various endeavours to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them in his service! When they gradually decline, that he so graciously upholds them; when ready to break faith with him, and quit his service, that by so apt methods he confirms them; when they actually wander and turn Vagabonds, that he should be so intent to reduce them! How admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is all this! View the whole case at once. They neglect his first Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, he repeats and inculcates them; They faint, he encourages and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports them; They revolt, he follows to bring them back: The cause of our admiration still rises higher and higher. How much is it, in this last instance
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:45607:22"/>
above all humane measures! Most men would disdain so to sue to Servants that forsake them, and are loath to confess their <hi>real need</hi> and want of them (were it never so great:) The <hi>Cynick</hi> scorn'd to look after his servant that left him, counting it a disgrace when <hi>Manes</hi> thought he could live without <hi>Diogenes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sen.</hi>
               </note> that <hi>Diogenes</hi> should not be able to live without <hi>Manes.</hi> The <hi>All-sufficient Deity</hi> stoops to that which <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digency</hi> and <hi>wretchedness</hi> think even too mean for them!</p>
            <p n="2">2. Consider <hi>the frankness of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, even of the best:</hi> for how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny omissions, how much lazieness and sloth, how many incogitancies and mistakes, how much real disservice must he forgive when he accepts them, and says (yet) <hi>'Tis well done?</hi> How little is it they do at the best? and how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable to him? and yet that little also he forms and even creates them to, and continually succours, and assists them in it; <hi>Works in them to will and to do.</hi> Otherwise nothing at all would be done, and yet how full, how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placential
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:45607:22"/>
his acceptance is!</p>
            <p n="3">3. Consider the <hi>largeness and bounty of his rewards,</hi> too large for our expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or conception. So that we even say most to it, when (even lost in won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) we only admire and say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Consider <hi>the kind of the Service</hi> which he thus bespeaks, accepts, and rewards. The best and most <hi>acceptable service</hi> any are capable of doing him, is when they <hi>accept him,</hi> take and chuse him to be their <hi>portion,</hi> and <hi>blessedness.</hi> Trust, love and delight in him as such, live upon his fulness, and (according to their several stations) perswade as many as they can to do so too. They that in the most peculiar sence are his <hi>Ministers</hi> or <hi>Servants,</hi> as they are more earnestly intent <hi>upon this,</hi> and win more Souls, are the more amply and gloriously rewarded. <hi>They that turn many to righteousnes, shine as stars.</hi> And for all the rest of his Servants, wherein do they serve him most, but when by their converse and example, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce others to entertain good thoughts
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:45607:23"/>
of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> and thereupon to make the <hi>same Choice</hi> which they have made, and become seriously Religious, which is most certainly connected with their being happy, and indeed in greatest part, their very Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness it self. And when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, support, encourage, and help on those that are in the way, or whom they are endeavouring to bring into the way to final blessedness! We as much need our servants, as they can us; they are our living, reasonable, but most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary instruments. The whole universe of created beings subsists by mutual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendencies; the uncreated being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any. Creatures are made to need one another. Infinite self-fulness, not capable of receiving additions, is most highly gratified by our chearful reception of its communications.</p>
            <p>Let us learn now to conceive of God answerably to all this: <hi>We do him not right,</hi> that we consider not his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable goodness, in so plain instances of it, with more frequent seriousness and intention of mind and Spirit, and <hi>shew
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:45607:23"/>
our selves</hi> stupid, unapprehensive Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; have we a thinking faculty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us? a power to use thoughts? and can we use it upon any thing more evident, more considerable, or that more concerns us? or do we never use it less pertinently?</p>
            <p n="7">7. How unreasonable is it either to quit the Service of our blessed Lord, or to serve him dejectedly? Quit it! Who hath more right in us? or where will we mend our selves? O the treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous folly of Apostacy! and how se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely is it wont to be animadverted on! 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.1. 'Tis said <hi>Rehoboam forsook the Law of the Lord, and all Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael with him:</hi> And what followed? <hi>Shishak</hi> the King of <hi>Egypt</hi> comes against them with a great power, and God sends them this Message by <hi>Shemaiah</hi> the Prophet, that <hi>Because they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken him,</hi> (vers. 5.) <hi>therefore he also had left them in the hands of Shishak:</hi> and afterwards that thô <hi>upon their hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling themselves, he would not quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy them,</hi> but grant them <hi>some delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi>; yet he adds, <hi>nevertheless ye shall

Since they would abandon <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>true Religion,</hi> he would by a very sensible instruction, and costly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience teach them to distinguish, and understand the difference, and make them know when they have a good Master; and if we serve him despon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, and with dejected Spirits, how causeless a Reproach do we cast upon him and his Service?

            <p>And that we may imitate such a good and faithful Servant, let me briefly set the example of <hi>such a one</hi> before you, in <hi>this excellent person</hi> lately taken from among us; which were it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to represent <hi>entirely,</hi> were one of the <hi>fairest Copies</hi> to write after, that <hi>this,</hi> or perhaps <hi>many former ages</hi> could afford us.</p>

He had all the advantages of Education from his Childhood, which the pious care of an affectionate, prudent, learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Father could give him, that were proper, and preparatory to the Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he was intended for: <hi>viz. that of the sacred Ministry.</hi> An Office whereof his excellent Father (the eminent, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, heavenly, reverend, ancient <hi>Mr. Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clough</hi> of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> whose Name in that Countrey hath still a grateful savour with all good men of whatsoever perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,) shewed his high esteem and love, not only by the most diligent discharge of it himself, but by dedicating all his Sons (which were <hi>four</hi> in number) to it, and giving his <hi>two Daughters</hi> in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to such also.

He went from it furnished with such a stock of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, substantial, as well as polite Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature, that shew'd him to have been no Loiterer there. He was a man of a clear, distinct understanding, of a very quick, discerning and penetrating Judgment, that would, on a sudden (as I have sometimes observed in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with him) strike through knotty difficulties into the inward Center of Truth, with such a felicity that things seem'd to offer themselves to him, which are wont to cost others a troublesome search. Nor were his Notions meerly Book-learnt, borrowed from Systems, and taken on trust, but formed by a due (but more speedy) comparing of things, as if Truth were more a-kin, and connatural to him than to most others, sooner digested, made his own, and inwrought into the temper and habit of his Mind, which afterwards<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

he liked not to muddy and discompose by busie agitations with others about that Truth which he found himself in a pleasant secure possession of, nor to contend concerning that which he had not found it necessary to contend for; he declined Controversie, not from ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility but dislike; for as he less need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it for a further good end, so he was most remote from loving it for it self; he was satisfy'd to have attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his end, and was better pleased to know, than to seem to others that he knew; he was of a curious sublime Fancy, and a lofty Style both in speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and writing, even in his most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar Letters, thô he industriously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest it in his popular Sermons, and other Negotiations with those of meaner ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

constant governing power of Religion, which made it be his business both to exercise and diffuse it to his uttermost; he was a mighty Lover of God and Men; and being of a lively active Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that Love was his facile, potent mover to the doing even of all the good that could be thought (in an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way) possible to him, and more than was possible to most other men: To give a true succinct account of the complexion of his Soul, he was even made up <hi>of Life and Love.</hi> Such was the clearness and sincerity of his Spirit, his constant Uprightness and Integrity, so little darkned by an <hi>evil Conscience,</hi> (and indeed, little ever clouded with melancholy Fumes) that he seemed to live in the constant sence of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and acceptance, and had nothing to do but to serve him with his might; whence his Spirit was formed to an <hi>habitual Chearfulness,</hi> and seem'd to feel within it self a continual Calm.

His Reverence of the Divine Majesty was most profound, his thoughts of God high and great, that seem'd totally to have compos'd him to Adoration, and even made him live a worshipping life; he was not wont to speak to God or of him at a vulgar rate; he was most absolutely resigned and given up to him; <hi>Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedness</hi> to his Interest, <hi>Acquiescence</hi> in his Wisdom and Will, were not <hi>meer Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts</hi> with him but <hi>Habits.</hi> No man could be more deeply concern'd about the <hi>affairs of Religion,</hi> and <hi>Gods Interest</hi> in the World, yet his <hi>solicitude</hi> was temper'd with that <hi>stedfast trust,</hi> that it might be seen the acknowledg'd Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of <hi>Gods governing the World, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintending and ordering all humane af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs</hi> by wise and steady Counsel, and

almighty Power, which in most others are but <hi>faint</hi> Notions, were with him turn'd into <hi>living sence</hi> and <hi>vital Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> which govern'd his Soul: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon his great Reverence of the Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty of God falling into a conjunction with an assured trust, and <hi>sence</hi> of his Love and Goodness, made that rare and happy Temperament with him, which I cannot better express than by a <hi>pleasant seriousness:</hi> What friend of his did ever at the first congress, see his face but with a grave Smile? when unexpectedly and by surprize he came in among his familiar Friends, it seem'd as if he had blest the room, as if a new Soul, or some <hi>good Genius</hi> were come among them.</p>
            <p>I need not tell them that survive who were nearest to him, how plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant a Relative he was. Nor doth any man need to tell me how pleasant a Friend! No man ever more understood than he the ingenuities and delights of Friendship, especially the high plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of gratifying and obliging another. The relishes whereof were so delicious
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:45607:28"/>
to him, that no Festival could be so grateful to any man as the opportunity was to him of making another tast, and feel his Kindness. Nor did I ever observe any thing so like a frequent fault in him, as an aptnes to overvalue his Friend.</p>
            <p>He was a man of most punctual, scrupulous fidelity. His word was ever with him so strictly Sacred, that in the smallest matters his appointments, thô numerous, were, through his great prudence, <hi>so sure</hi> that one might, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the intervenience of extraordinary Providence, as certainly expect them, as the returns of Day and Night. So that they that knew him, thô most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with his Society, were never wont to urge for his stay with them beyond his prefixed time (which he commonly mentioned at his first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance) knowing it would be in vain.</p>
            <p>He was of a large and great Soul, Comprehensive of the Interests of God, the World, the Church, his Countrey, his Friends, and (with a peculiar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernednes) of the Souls of men. Ready,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:45607:28"/>
to his uttermost, to serve them all. Made up of compassion towards the distressed. Of delight in the good, and of general benignity towards all men. He had a Soul, a Life, a Name darkned with no cloud but that of his own great humility, which clouded him only to himself, but beautifi'd and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him in the eyes of all others. An humility that allowed no place with him to any aspiring design, or high thought, that could ever be perceived by word, look or gesture. Except the high thoughts and designs which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought to be excluded nor represt. His greatest ambition was to do good, and partake it in the highest and best kind of it. To make the nearest ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches he could to the <hi>pattern</hi> and <hi>fountain</hi> of all goodnes.</p>
            <p>And now looking upon so qualify'd a person, as engaged by <hi>Office</hi> in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar sort of service to Christ, to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and draw in Souls to him, and prepare them for a blessed Eternity: How great things may we expect?

               <hi>Mells</hi> in <hi>Sommersetshire</hi> was his first, and only (publick) Station.</p>
            <p>Thither he was brought by so pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar a conduct and direction of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as seem'd to carry with it some signification what great use he was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to be of in that place.</p>
            <p>The very reverend Dr. <hi>Whitchcot,</hi> being, also, at that time <hi>Fellow</hi> of the same <hi>Colledge</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a Living in that Countrey, that was in the disposition of that <hi>Colledge,</hi> obtained of him to accompany him in a Journey to visit, and make some trial of the People he had been design'd to take the Charge of. Where that so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complisht Person exprest a Resolution fit to be exemplary to others of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundest Learning (and which was strictly afterwards followed by this his chosen Companion) Preaching his <hi>first</hi> Sermon (as himself was pleas'd to tell me) upon those words, <hi>I determined to know nothing among you, but Jesus Christ and him crucify'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After some time spent together here, the Doctors affairs recalling him, for
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:45607:29"/>
the present, to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> he prevailed with <hi>our worthy Friend</hi> to stay behind, and supply his absence among that People.</p>
            <p>What followes I was inform'd of by another hand, but one so nearly rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this our deceased Friend, and so well acquainted with the more consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable occurrences of his Life, as not to leave me in doubt concerning so mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous a thing, as how he came to be settled <hi>in a Countrey</hi> so remote from <hi>his own,</hi> and where he was so meer a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. And it fell out thus.</p>
            <p>During his abode upon this occasion in those parts, a noted <hi>Gentleman,</hi> the <hi>Patron</hi> of the <hi>Rectory of Mells,</hi> being at that time <hi>High Sheriff</hi> of the <hi>County,</hi> sent to Mr. <hi>Fairclough</hi> (of whose worth, Fame had not let him long be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant) desiring him to Preach the <hi>Assize-Sermon.</hi> Some circumstances ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving also brought the matter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in so narrow a compas, that the straits of time made it necessary to press the request with more importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity than could admit of a denial. That
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:45607:30"/>
Performance was so highly acceptable, and so newly over when the <hi>Patron</hi> was surprized with the tidings of the former <hi>Rector of Mells</hi> his Death, that he immediately told our worthy Friend, he could not otherwise so fitly gratifie him for his Sermon, as by conferring upon him such <hi>a Living,</hi> which, if he pleased to accept it, <hi>was his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Opportunity of stated Service,</hi> in a Calling to which he had most seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously devoted himself, <hi>more than the emolument</hi> (as did afterwards suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently appear) soon determin'd his thoughts, and fix't him in this Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: There he shone many years a bright and a lively Light, <hi>a Burning as well as a Shining one</hi>; it was soon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd what a <hi>Star</hi> was risen in that <hi>Horizon,</hi> and a confluence was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gathered, of such <hi>as rejoyced in the light of it,</hi> which made an obscure Countrey Village, soon become a most noted place; from sundry Miles about, thither was the great resort, so that I have wondered to see so throng an
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:45607:30"/>
Auditory as I have sometimes had the opportunity to observe in such a place, that did usually attend his most fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Ministry. And O how hath that Congregation been wont to melt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his holy Fervours! His Prayers, Sermons, and other Ministerial Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances had that strange pungency, quickness, and authority with them, <hi>at some times</hi>; that softness, gentleness, sweetness, alluringness <hi>at others,</hi> that one would think it scarce possible to <hi>resist the Spirit and Power wherewith he spake.</hi> And the effect did in a blessed measure correspond; they became a much enlightned, knowing, judicious, convinced, reformed, even somewhat generally, and in good part, a serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Religious People; his Labours here were almost incredible; besides his usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al exercises on the Lords-day, of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Reading the Scriptures, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Catechising, Administring the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments; (as the occasions or stated seasons occurr'd) he usually five dayes in the week, betimes in the morning, appeared in publick, Pray'd, and Preach't
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:45607:31"/>
an expository Lecture upon some porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Holy Scriptures, in course to such as could then Assemble, which so many did, that he alwayes had a considerable Congregation; nor did he ever produce in publick any thing which did not smell of the Lamp. And I know that the most eminent for <hi>quality</hi> and <hi>judgment</hi> among his Hearers, valued those his Morning-Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises for elaborateness, accuracy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structiveness, equally with his Lords-dayes Sermons. Yet also he found time not only to visit the sick, (which opportunities he caught at with great eagerness) but also in a continual course, all the Families within his charge; and personally, and severally to converse with every one that was capable, labouring to understand the present state of their Souls, and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself to them in Instructions, Reproofs, Admonitions, Exhortations and Encouragements suitably thereto; and he went through all with the greatest facility and Pleasure imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; his whole Heart was in his
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:45607:31"/>
work. Every day for many years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether he used to be up by Three in the Morning or sooner, and to be with God (which was his dear delight) when others Slept. Few men had ever less hindrance from the Body, or more dominion over it, a better habited Mind and Body have rarely dwelt together. No controversies arose among his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, within his notice, which he made it not his business to get pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently compos'd, and his help and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was wont to be sought by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of eminent rank, and in matters of very great difficulty and importance for that purpose; his own Love of Peace always inclining him, and his great Prudence well enabling him to be exceeding useful in any such Case.</p>
            <p>Nor were his Labours confined with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that narrower verge; his Name and worth were too well known abroad to let him be engross'd by <hi>one single Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish:</hi> in how many places did he scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Light, and diffuse the Knowledge of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:45607:32"/>
God, wheresoever, within his reach, the opportunity of a Lecture, occasional or fixt did invite!</p>
            <p>The state of things in those dayes making it necessary (and not hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) that what was to be done for the preservation of <hi>Common Order,</hi> must be by the <hi>spontaneous Associating</hi> of the <hi>Pastors</hi> of many Congregations; how did he inspirit those <hi>Assemblies!</hi> The deference that was given to him even by very reverend Persons of great value, and much exceeding him in years, with the effectual influence he had upon all their affairs (manifestly aiming at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the promoting of Religion, and the common good) were only ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of the commanding Power of true worth: And the good effects up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the People shew'd, how much could be done by a naked, undisguised re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation of ones self to mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences in the sight of God: Nor would his Brethren of greatest value (and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers there were in those parts of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great) think it any detraction
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:45607:32"/>
from themselves to acknowledge much more to the wise, modest, humble acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of his Spirit in their common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments, than I shall be willing to arrogate to him. He was, upon the whole, a very <hi>publick</hi> Blessing in that Countrey while he kept his <hi>publick Station</hi> in it: And when the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached of his quitting it, he emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently shew'd his constant, great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in reference to the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted things that occasioned his doing so in all his reasonings with his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren about them. And it further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the earnest bent of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to form the minds of his People, <hi>as much as was possible,</hi> unto <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Vnion</hi> under the conduct of whoso should succeed him in the <hi>serious care</hi> of their Souls; and to a meek, unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining Submission to <hi>that present Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> which was, <hi>now,</hi> to be made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and them; whereof the <hi>extant abridgment</hi> of sundry his later Sermons to them, are an abundant Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony; (thô such a repression of their Sorrows, it was not possible to them
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:45607:33"/>
to receive othewise, than as dutiful Children are wont to do, the Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of an affectionate dying Father, not to mourn for his Death:) In the <hi>Substantial things of Religion</hi> no man was more fervently zealous, about <hi>the Circumstantials</hi> none more cool and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate.</p>
            <p>But he could in nothing prevaricate with his (once settled) Judgment, or depart in his Practice one Ace from it; yet such was the candor and soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Spirit, that nothing could be more remote from him, than to pass any harsh Censures upon those that received that satisfaction in the scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled points, which he could not: But he continued a most entire undiminisht Friendship with many of them (and several of eminent note, by whom also it was equally cherisht on their parts) even to the last.</p>
            <p>His great contempt of the world, and remoteness from making the <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Office</hi> subservient to secular Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:45607:33"/>
a design of enriching himself by it, or more than to subsist, too soon appeared in the mean condition, to which he was brought by that depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. For thô the Annual profits of his <hi>Living</hi> were very considerable, yet his free (but well regulated) <hi>hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and large, diffusive Charity</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his excellent Consort, one of the most pious, prudent, well accomplisht Matrons I ever knew, most readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd with him) kept them from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing superfluous, or flowing into Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers. He had laid up no <hi>Treasure</hi> but <hi>in Heaven.</hi> And was the Son of a no way unlike Father, from whom the expectancy of a patrimonial Estate could not be great; and whom (to his no small Joy while he continued) he survived but a little. So that for some Years (as I have heard him say) he did owe much of his Subsistence to the Bounty of some worthy <hi>Citizens</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> whose <hi>temper</hi> it is, to take more pleasure <hi>in doing such good,</hi> than in <hi>having it told the World who they were.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:45607:34"/>His Usefulness was such since his deprivation, (<hi>not in serving a Party,</hi> a thing too mean, and little to be ever thought of by him without dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain; but) in pressing the <hi>great,</hi> and <hi>agreed</hi> things <hi>that belong to serious, living Religion,</hi> that it even melts my Soul to think of the overwhelming Sorrows wherewith the tydings of his Death must have been received, by <hi>Multitudes in the West,</hi> that were often wont with greatest delight and Fruit to enjoy his most lively, edifying La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
            <p>His Decease confirms it to us, <hi>once more,</hi> that nothing belonging to this World of ours is too good to die.</p>
            <p>But it is a great Argument of Gods kind propensions towards it, and speaks much of his good will to men, that now and then such heavenly Creatures are permitted to inhabit it, and such <hi>Specimina</hi> and Efforts of the divine Life, to appear and be put forth in it.
