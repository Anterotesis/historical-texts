            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nother Tranſlation formerly deſign'd (after this ſeem'd to be accepted of) was perfected and acted, this, not returned to me until that very day. Such a rejection makes it more contemptible to ſome, than perhaps it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves: Parents are apt to dote on their own brats, eſpecially thoſe of their old age. Impartial men are the beſt remedies againſt this miſchief: friends, and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic'd perſons, will ſtill have ſomething of the bias, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from thoſe who know leaſt of me, I am likelieſt to take a true meaſure of my ſelf, one cauſe why this is now in print.</p>
            <p>Though my humble reſpects to her Royal Highneſs prompted me to undertake a Tranſlation in verſe, becauſe ſhe loves plays of that kind, and is as eminent in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as dignity, yet I preſume not to beg her protection, only as it took birth at <hi>Sommerſet Houſe,</hi> I hope ſhe will not deſpiſe it from the report of others.</p>
            <p>For my moſt gracious Miſtreſs whom I have ſo long ſerv'd, and in former Playes not diſpleas'd, I dare not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs this, becauſe my firſt eſſay of this nature.</p>
            <p>For her Son; that Sun of Majeſty, I am too much dazled at this diſtance to attempt nearer, ſince only Eagle-Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes can approach his brightneſs; yet I durſt in all humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb facs="tcp:98316:3"/>
preſent the Original and my deſign in tranſlating it to his Princely conſideration. For the ſubject of it is the reſtoration of a gallant Prince to his juſt inheritance, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years after the unjuſt and horrid murder of a Saint-like Father, and this by the courage and prudence of one, who ſeem'd in the vulgar eye to go another way. Yet I know thoſe who look'd upon all his actings when moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, to be like that of a Geer-falcon, who though ſhe ſeems not to eye the Hern, but works a contrary way, 'tis but to gain the wind, by which advantage ſhe makes her ſelf the maſter of her deſign. All this, if I miſtake not, is a juſt parallel.</p>
            <p>Though what's already ſaid may ſeem too long, I cannot conclude without ſome remark upon <hi>Leontina's</hi> action, which ſome cenſure unnatural, ſo unwarrantable: But if we are bound to ſacrifice our own lives, to preſerve that of our Prince, we may expoſe our Child's for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Heir, the continuance of a juſt and Royal line being not one of the leaſt bleſſings to a Nation: if any yet doubt I refer them to the Caſuiſts, as I do what I have writ to the cenſure of all that love ſerious Plays, to whom I dedicate this.</p>
