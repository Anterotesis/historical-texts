            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

joy, you may shortly see the work come to more maturitie and perfection.</p>
            <p>Amidst your <hi>Honours</hi> grave and vveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie intendments for this and other occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of much concernement, may you please to reflect on this discourse. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that there be many passages therein very confiderable for these and after times: and that they will make much for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing of <hi>our thankefulnesse to God:</hi> when we behold from what beginnings, in an 100 and few moe yeares, <hi>Gods truth</hi> hath risen, and Papisticall and Anabaptisticall errour faln. It is remarkable that the points by <hi>D. Luther</hi> mainly opposed were <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, the Popes boundlesse power,</hi> merit of <hi>workes, Purgatory, Communion but in one kinde:</hi> all <note n="g" place="margin">When wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Cities and Castles are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, Villages must yeeld. <hi>Isor.</hi>
               </note> chiefe points and palpably and and undeniably grosse. And on the other side, that he stood up against the <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists rebaptization of themselves, their not baptizing infants</hi> (as not commanded by Christ;) <hi>their having all things in common</hi> (as had the Primitive Christians, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 44.) and against the <hi>Antinomians heresies</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:59553:4"/>
concerning the law, and other like erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous fancies. It is also observable that <hi>Dr. Luther</hi> striking at the <hi>Popes</hi> unlawfull power, never sought to exalt himselfe to honour or <note n="h" place="margin">He left his wife and three children in want and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest a signe thereof.</note> riches. For though, as he saith, he himselfe with other learned men exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted <hi>Episcopall Authority</hi> in visiting the Churches of <hi>Saxony,</hi> &amp; reforming things amisse: yet he knowing his talent fittest for the <hi>Chaire of Wittenberg,</hi> never would rise higher; but wrote a book concerning <hi>Christian Episcopacy,</hi> and installed <hi>Nicolas Amsdorf</hi> Bishop of <hi>Neoburg,</hi> and <hi>George Anhaltinus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Mersburg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in regard that <hi>Luther</hi> studied and read, as Professor, <hi>Philosophie</hi> of divers kinds, was well versed in the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and in <hi>Aquinas, Scotus, Occam,</hi> &amp; other School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and attained to the <hi>Greek and Hebrew</hi> tongues: he was thereby <note n="i" place="margin">

            <p>It was also very commendable in him, that he disliked railing discourse without

However men did project to bend the excellent endowments of these worthy men to their owne purposes, God turned them to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter use, and seasoning them with his grace, fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them for the confusion of the <hi>Old &amp; New Egypts.</hi> God will be <note n="b" place="margin">When the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent is seene, then wee can observe, how Godshand was in the worke.</note> 
               <hi>plainly knowne</hi> to have matters of great importance at his owne disposing. He of his great goodnesse directs to the right object his servants ardent zeale to do good: as in judgement he lets the malicious and envious zeale of both Egypts persist in an evill course to their overthrow. Hence it was, that as God took off S. <hi>Paul</hi> from his blinde and unseasonable zeale for <hi>Moses</hi> Law in the Pharisaicall way, and bent it to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the Gospell: So he quelled <hi>Luthers</hi> raging fury and intent <note n="c" place="margin">As S. <hi>Paul</hi> did to vex and kil Christians, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 1. &amp; 22. 19.</note> to vex and kill the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers of the Pope: and put a zealous spirit in him for the maintenance of sacred Truth, and the downfall of Popish superstition. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed rightly did <hi>Erasmus</hi> judge, that <note n="d" place="margin">Epist. B. 14. pag. 453..</note>

The father of <hi>George Aemilius</hi> (as <hi>Luther</hi> often hath related) first <note place="margin">

            <p>At fourteene yeeres of age, he with <hi>Iohn Reineck,</hi>

                  <hi>An. Dom.</hi> 1496. <hi>John Reineck</hi> his School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow at <hi>Magdeburg.</hi>
               </note> who proved a man of especiall vertue and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in those parts, were sent to <hi>Magdeburg.</hi> Whence a league of intire friendship ever continued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween these two; either because of a Sympathy and agreement of their natures, or their education together in their first studies. At <hi>Magdeburg</hi> he, as many others born of honest parents, lived a poore Scholler for the space of one yeere. <hi>Thus even the greatest matters have small beginnings, and scarce any thing is highly exalted, but from a lowly degree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thence by his parents he was removed to <hi>Isenak,</hi> where was a Schoole of great fame: here was a <note place="margin">
                  <hi>An.</hi> 1498. he went to <hi>Isenak.</hi>
               </note> Schoolemaster, who (as <hi>Luther</hi> by experience found, and would professe) taught <hi>Grammar</hi> more dextrously and truely. One reason also of his being
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59553:11"/>
sent thither was, because his Mother was born there of a worthy and ancient family. There he perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">How he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected his Grammar learning.</note> his Grammar learning, and being of a very quick wit, and by nature fitted for eloquence, he soone surpassed his School-fellows in copiousnesse of speech and matter, and excelled in expression of his minde both in prose and verse.</p>
            <p>Upon this his tasting the sweetnesse of learning, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luthers</hi> love to learning.</note> he was inflamed with an earnest desire to goe to some <hi>Vniversitie,</hi> the well-spring of all good litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and surely had he met with good and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable Tutors, he by his piercing wit had attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all good Arts: and perhaps he might by the milder studies of true Philosophy, and diligence in well framing his style somewhat have tempered the vehemencie of his nature.</p>
            <p>He went to <hi>Erford An.</hi> 1501. Where he fell upon the crabbed and thorny <hi>Logick</hi> of that age: which <note place="margin">He studied at <hi>Erford, An.</hi> 1501.</note> he soone attained, as one who by the sagacitie of his wit, was better able to dive into the causes and other places of Arguments then others.</p>
            <p>Here, out of a desire of better learning, he read <note place="margin">His course in his reading.</note> over <hi>Cicero, Livy, Virgil,</hi> and other monuments of ancient Latine Authors. These he perused, not as a child, to glean Phrases from them: but to discern what therein was usefull towards the right con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of mans life. And to that end seriously observed the counsels and grave sentences in those writers: and having a faithfull and sure memory, what ever he read or heard, he had it still in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse for present use. Hereby he so excelled in his
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59553:12"/>
youth, that the whole Universitie admired his wit.</p>
            <p>When at <hi>Erphord</hi> he was graced <note n="a" place="margin">a His being M. of Arts, <hi>An.</hi> 1503. or as others, 1505.</note> with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>Master of Arts</hi> at twentie yeeres of his age, he read, as Professour, <hi>Aristotles Physicks, Ethicks</hi> and other parts of <hi>Philosophy.</hi> Afterward his kindred seeing it fit that so worthy indowments of wit and eloquence should be cherished for the publique good, by their advise he betooke <note n="b" place="margin">b His study of the Law.</note> himself to the study of the <hi>Law.</hi> But not long after when he was 21. yeeres old, of a sudden besides the purpose of his parents and kindred (upon an affright from his faithfull mates violent death): he betook himself to the <hi>Augustine Monks</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">c He entred the Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>An.</hi> 1504.</note> 
               <hi>Colledge in Erphord.</hi> But before he entred the Monastery, he entertained his fellow <note n="d" place="margin">d He taketh his leave of his fellow Students, <hi>Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>epist.</hi>
               </note> students with a cheerfull banquet: and thereupon sent them letters valedictory; and send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his parents the Ring and gown of his degree of Master of Arts, unfolded to them the reason of the change of his course of life. It much grieved his parents that so excellent parts should be spent in a life little differing from death. But for a moneths space no man could be admitted to speake with him.</p>
            <p>Nor was it povertie, but the love of a pious life, which bent his minde to the Monastical life. In which though he spent his time in the usual schoole learning, and read the Writers upon the Sentences, and in publique disputations clearly opened their inextricable labyrinths to the admiration of many: yet because in this kinde of life he sought not to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59553:12"/>
ennoble his fame, but to further his study of a pious life; he looked into those studies but upon the by; and with much ease attained their Scholastical methods.</p>
            <p>When on a time in the Library of the Colledge, running over the books thereof in order, he met <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luther</hi> meets with a Latine Bible.</note> with a copie of the <hi>Latine Bible,</hi> which he never saw before; There with admiration he observed that there were moe <hi>Evangelical and Apostolical texts</hi> then what were read to the people in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. In the <hi>old Testament</hi> with great attention he read the story of <hi>Samuel</hi> and <hi>Anna</hi> his mother: and began to wish, that he was the owner of the like book; which not long after he obtained. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he spent his time on the Propheticall and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall writings, the fountaines of all heavenly doctrine, seeking thence to enforme his minde with Gods will, and to nourish in himself the feare of God, and true faith in Christ from true and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted grounds. Some sicknesse and feare whet him on to attempt these studies more earnestly.</p>
            <p>It is said, that in this Colledge <hi>Luther</hi> in his youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger yeers fell into a most violent disease, in so much <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luther</hi> fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a grievous sicknesse, <hi>An.</hi> 1501.</note> that there was no hope of life: and that an ancient Priest came to him, and with these words comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">A Priest comforted him.</note> him. <hi>Sir, Be of good courage, for your disease is not mortall: God will raise you up to be a man who shall afford comfort to many others.</hi> At the first, the Monks <note place="margin">The Monks used him hardly.</note> handled him somewhat harshly, whilest he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the office of the <hi>Custos,</hi> and was compelled to cleanse the uncleane places: as also to walk up
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59553:13"/>
and down the Citie with a bagge or wallet. But up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the request of the Universitie, of which he had been a member, he was eased of that burden.</p>
            <p>He was often cheered up by conference with the ancient Priest; to whom he revealed his feares and scruples of minde, and heard him discoursing of faith at large, and going on in the Creed to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle. <hi>I beleeve the Remission of sins.</hi> Which he thus <note place="margin">The Article of remission of sinnes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</note> explained. Namely, that a man must not onely in generall beleeve that sinnes are remitted to some men, as to <hi>David,</hi> and to <hi>Ester,</hi> for this the devils beleeve: but that God commands, that we should each man in particular beleeve, that our sinnes be forgiven us in Christ Jesus. This exposition, said he, is confirmed by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Bernard:</hi> and shewed him the place in his Sermon upon the Annuntiation: where these words are to be found. <hi>But adde this, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve this also, that thy sins are forgiven thee for Christs</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bernard.</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon on the Annunt.</note> 
               <hi>sake. This is the Testimony in thy heart, which the spirit of God giveth, saying, Thy sins are forgiven thee. For the Apostle thus determines of the matter; That a man is freely justified by faith. Luther</hi> said, that he was not onely confirmed in the truth; but also put in minde of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ever in these words, asserting this trueth: <hi>We are justified by faith.</hi> Concerning this point, after that he had read the expositions of divers men, he further said, that from the spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Paul,</hi> he observed to accrew unto himself much comfort, and great light to discerne the vanitie of other interpretations, which then were used.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:59553:13"/>
Then he began to read S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Augustines workes:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">He read S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Augustine.</hi>

Yet did he not utterly cast of  the reading of <hi>Gabriel</hi> and <hi>Camaracensis,</hi> writers on the Sentences, but was able to recite them by heart in a manner.

especially) <hi>that he had so large a commission from the Pope, that though a man should have defloured the Blessed Virgin, for money he could pardon the sinne.</hi> And further he did not onely give pardons for sins past, but for sins to come.

            <p>

Here also it was objected to him, that he denyed the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Christ to be a treasure of Indulgences: and that he taught that faith was necessary for all which should come to the Sacrament.

               <hi>Luther,</hi> dismissed him, and dealt with <hi>Staupicius</hi> to bring <hi>Luther</hi> to revoke, what he had taught.

The Prince sent that letter to the Legate: and appointed <hi>Luther</hi> to abide at <hi>Wittenberg.</hi> Of this <hi>Luther</hi> thus wrote: <hi>The Prince was fully minded, that I should stay: but what his minde now is, since the Royal proceedings are published, and I have appealed to the Councel, I know not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For he understanding by the Cardinals Letter, that Judgement should passe on him at Rome, he <note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>About the same time towards the end of the 18 yeere, the Pope sent <hi>Charles Multitius</hi> a Misnian <note place="margin">

They not knowing the force of this speech, answered, <hi>What know we, whether at Rome ye sit on wooden or stone seats?</hi> He further required of <hi>Luther, that he would have a regard to the Churches peace; and promised to</hi>

               <hi>endeavour, that the Pope should do the like: Luther freely promised most readily to doe what ever he could with a safe conscience in regard of Gods Trueth: and affirmed that himself was desirous and studious of peace, and that it was not his fault that these stirres arose; for necessitie had urged him to do, what he had done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

            <p>Matters being growne to this height of dispute, and <hi>Luther</hi> having many adversaries; at <hi>Leipsick</hi> a towne in <hi>Misnia</hi> belonging to <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> Cosen german to Prince <hi>Frederik,</hi> in the 19. yeere a disputation was held.

Hereupon the 17. day of June, <hi>Iohn Eckius</hi> and <hi>Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lostadius</hi> began the disputation about free-will. Namely, <hi>whether there be in man any free will to doe good as of himselfe?</hi> that is, as they say: <hi>whether in congruitie we deserve grace, when we doe what is in us to doe? Eckius</hi> granted that <hi>there is not in man a genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and naturall power and abilitie to doe a good worke, but an acq<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>
               <hi>Luther</hi> could by no meanes obtaine leave of Duke <hi>George</hi> freely with his safety to dispute, and thereupon came not as a disputer, but an as Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to <hi>Leipsick,</hi> under the protection granted to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolostadius.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Eckius</hi> comming to <hi>Luthers</hi> Lodging said, that he heard <hi>that Luther refused to</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luther</hi> invited by <hi>Eckius</hi> to dispute.</note> 
               <hi>dispute, Luther</hi> answered: <hi>How can I dispute, seeing I cannot obtaine protection from George the Duke.</hi> To this <hi>Eckius</hi> replied: <hi>If I may not dispute with you, I will no longer dispute with Carolostadius. For</hi> I <hi>came hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to dispute with you. If I can obtaine for you the Dukes leave, will you dispute?</hi> When <hi>Luther</hi> assented thereunto, <hi>Eckius</hi> presently procured for him a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique grant of safety and liberty to dispute. This <hi>Eckius</hi> did out of an assured confidence of victorie and renowne to himselfe, by confirming <hi>that the Pope is the Head of the Church, Iure Divino, by Divine right:</hi> which <hi>Luther</hi> denied.

               <hi>could not be without an head, seeing it was a body</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of severall members. Then he produced the place in <hi>Matthew: Thou art Peter &amp;c.</hi> and some speeches of St <hi>Ierome</hi> and <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and the Councel of <hi>Constance,</hi> where against the Articles of the <hi>Hussites,</hi> it was concluded: <hi>That it was necessary to salvation, that men should beleeve that the Pope was the Oecomenicall Bishop,</hi> or Christs vicar over the whole world. Afterward they entred into dispute <hi>about Purgatorie, and Indulgences, (but in briefe) about re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, about remission both of sin and its punishment, and about the power of priests.</hi> The two last dayes <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolostadius</hi> disputed againe, and on the 14. day of July the disputation ended. This disputation was set forth afterward by <hi>Luther,</hi> who granted <hi>that the Pope by humane right was head of the Church.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <note place="margin">Epist.

Luther</hi> afterward changed his opinion about this point. Before this disputation at <hi>Leipsick, Luther</hi> was desired by <hi>Charles Multitius</hi> to goe to <hi>Confluence,</hi> there to plead his cause before him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Popes Commissary. But <hi>Luther</hi> excused himselfe, and shewed that for many reasons, he neither could, nor ought to goe thither.</p>
            <p>In the yeere 1520. upon <hi>Multitius</hi> advise, <hi>Luther</hi> 
               <note place="margin">

of peace. About this time <hi>Frederik</hi> the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector</hi> fell into a grievous sicknesse. Whereupon <hi>Luther</hi> moved by some friends, and out of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an charity wrote the booke called <hi>Tesseradecas</hi> to comfort him. Then also he wrote the book <hi>Of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of sins:</hi> in which he took occasion to speak of vowes, and deplored their torturing of mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences. And whereas in an other Treatise written by him, he had said: <hi>that he judged it behoofefull, if the Councel would so permit, that the Lords supper should be administred to all in both kindes:</hi> This speech, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it directly crossed the last <hi>Lateran Councel,</hi> was excepted against by many: amongst whom was <hi>Iohn</hi> Bishop of <hi>Misnia;</hi> who prohibited the the Churchmen under his jurisdiction to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster the Lords supper in both kindes, and enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to suppresse <hi>Luthers</hi> booke. <hi>Luther</hi> maintained his cause and answered his Edict.

               </note> the Divines of <hi>Cullen</hi> by a decree censure some of <hi>Luthers bookes as wicked and worthy to be burnt: and held it fit that Luther should recant his opinions.</hi> When <hi>Luther</hi> heard of this, he answered every particular punctually.

He said moreover, that it was a griefe to him to heare, that some great men disputed concerning the Primacie of Rome, free-will, and other sleight matters (so he call'd them) not much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to a Christian indeed: and that such like rash opinions could not be broached among the ignorant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but with incouraging them to disobedience; He wrote also about the Lords Suppers celebrating in both kinds, and about the Authoritie of Councels.</hi> And shut up his letter with <hi>Gamaliels</hi> verdict. <hi>If thy work be of God;</hi>

Some Noble <hi>Germans</hi> approvers of <hi>Luthers</hi> judgement, hearing this, offered <hi>Luther</hi> entertainment and protection, as namely, <hi>Francis a Sickengen, Hulderike Hutten, Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vester de Schavenburgen.</hi> Of whom the said <hi>Sylvester</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:59553:23"/>
wrote to <hi>Luther,</hi> and intreated him, not to depart into <hi>Bohemia,</hi> or into any other countrey, but to come to him, during the time of the Popes exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speration and menaces, and promised that an 100. <hi>French</hi> Horse should attend his safetie. Hereupon <hi>Luther</hi> taking courage admonisheth <hi>Spalatenus,</hi> that this course should by the Letter of <hi>Duke Frederik,</hi> be made known to the Cardinal of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>George.</hi> These are <hi>Luthers</hi> words. <hi>I send you the Letter of</hi> Sylvester <note place="margin">Tom. 1. epist.</note> Schavenb. <hi>the French Knight, and were it not displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to you, I desire that by the letter of the Prince, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice may be given to the Cardinal of</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. George, <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may know, that should they with their threats and curses expell me from</hi> Witten. <hi>they should effect nothing else, but to make a bad matter much worse. For now there are not onely in Bohemia, but even in the midst of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many such Princes, who both will and can defend me from the threats thundred out against me by mine adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries. And then perhaps it may so fall out, that biding under their protection, I shall more strongly bend my forces against the Romanists, then if under the Princes government, I should publiquely performe my place as Reader of Divinitie. This, unlesse God prevent it, will doubtlesse be the issue of this matter. Hitherto I have given all due respect to the Prince, but then, if I be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked by ill usage, I shall not need to submit unto him. And therefore in what matters soever I have not so roughly dealt with them, let them attribute my forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance therein not to my modesty, nor to their tyranny, nor their deserts, but to my respect to the Prince, and to his authoritie, as also to the common good of the Students</hi>

On the contrary I (unlesse I can get no fire) will burn all the Pontifician law, the sink of beresies; yet, I will put an end to my humble observance, which I have hitherto in vaine shewed; and wherewith the enemies of the Gospel are more and more incensed.</hi>

               <hi>were written by you, and do you acknowledge them to be yours?</hi> The second, <hi>Whether you will revoke and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant any thing in them, or stand in defence</hi> of them. <hi>Ierome Schurfius</hi> a Lawyer on <hi>Luthers</hi> part, desired that the titles of the books might be recited and spoken publiquely, which being done; <hi>Luther</hi> briefly repeated what was desired of him, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered. <note place="margin">

               <q>Concerning the books now named, I professe and acknowledge that they be mine; but concerning my defence of what I have written, (that I may answer rightly thereunto) seeing it is a matter of very great moment, I desire (that I

may not speake rashly and against my conscience) some time to deliberate.</q> After some debate of the matter, <hi>Eckius</hi> said again. <q>Though by <hi>Caesar</hi> letters missive you might well understand the cause, why you were sent for; and therefore need not to delay, but make your answer presently: yet <hi>Caesar,</hi> such is his clemency, granteth you one day for to deliberate on the matter: and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands that tomorrow about this houre you here present yourself, and make your distinct answer by word of mouth, and not by writing.</q> Upon <hi>Luthers</hi> desiring of respit, some thought that he would not be constant: but they failed in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.

                  <hi>Luther</hi> incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers present. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 19. 20.</note> he should be of good courage and not faint, <hi>Nor feare them who could kill the body onely, but not hurt the soule.</hi> Others put him in minde, to meditate on this: <hi>When ye shall appeare before Kings and Princes, be not solicitous, how and what to answer. For in that moment, it shall be given you, what you shall say.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The day following, <hi>Luther</hi> appeared at the houre appointed. And after that <hi>Eckius</hi> had asked him: <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luthers</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond answer.</note> 
               <hi>What now was his resolution?</hi> he first humbly desired of the <hi>Emperour</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi> 
               <q>That they would grant him their gentle attention: <hi>and then said:</hi> Of the books which I have written, some of them tend to faith and Pietie; to these my adversaries give ample Testimony. Should I recant these, I might be justly censured as a wicked man. Other
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59553:28"/>
of my books are against the Pope of Rome and Papisticall doctrine, which both hath and still doth much trouble the Christian world, and doth much mischiefe. These should I revoke, I should confirme their tyranny. The third sort of my books are against some private men, who defend the Papists cause, and by many calumnies upon me. In these, I confesse, I have been too vehement: and besides I confesse, that I am not of an uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring perfection: but yet I can not safely revoke these books, unlesse I will set open a gap to the impudency of many. Being a man I may erre: and therefore desire any one better to instruct me by the testimony of Scripture. <hi>When he had</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eckius</hi> indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and reply.</note> 
                  <hi>thus said,</hi> Eckius <hi>with a sowre countenance replyed.</hi> You answer not to the matter, nor doth it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to you to call the authoritie of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell into question. A plaine and direct answer is required of you, whether you desire that your writings should stand good. <hi>Then said Luther.</hi> Seeing you, O Caesar, and the Princes command me to answer punctually, I obey. This is my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution: Unlesse I be convicted by testimony of Scripture or evident reason, I may not revoke any thing, which I have written or spoken. <hi>For I will not in any wise wound my conscience.</hi> I do not conforme my beleefe to the Popes or the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels determinations alone; for they have often erred and delivered contrarieties one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I neither can nor will doe any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Gods word to the offence of my consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59553:29"/>
Seeing it is neither safe nor honest to do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing against conscience. This will I stand to: vary from this I may not. God helpe me, A men.</q> When he was againe urged, he persisted in this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. So they departed.</p>
            <p>The next day <hi>Caesar</hi> sent a letter to the assembly of the Princes; this was the summe thereof. <q>Our <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Caesars</hi> Letter to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces about <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> cause.</note> ancestors and other Christian Princes obeyed carefully the Church of Rome which now D <hi>Martin Luther</hi> opposeth: now because he is reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute not to yeeld one inch of his errors, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not without a blemish to our name depart from the example of our ancestors, but must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the ancient faith, and be assistant to the Sea of Rome: we will then excomunicate <hi>Martin Luther</hi> himselfe and all his adherents, and take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other course, which may conduce to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish these disputes. But we will not in any wise violate, and breake our promise made to him under our seale, but give him safe conduct to the place, whence he came.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Letter of <hi>Caesar</hi> was diligently and a good while scanned in the Senate by the Princes. It is reported that some there were among them, who would have followed the decree and practise of the Councel of <hi>Constance:</hi> and held themselves not bound to make good the promise of his safe return. But some of the Princes, especially <hi>Lodowik</hi> Prince <hi>Palatine</hi> (as it is reported) earnestly withstood them. Wherefore they judged that not onely fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie was to be observed towards him, but also, that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59553:29"/>
he was not rashly to be condemned: because the matter was of very great consequence, whatsoever the Emperour decreed: whom being newly come to the Imperiall seat they did well perceive to be pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and provoked by the Popes instruments against <hi>Luther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After a few dayes the Archbishop of <hi>Triers</hi> and <note place="margin">The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> dealing with <hi>Luther-Slcidan.</hi> B. 3.</note> other Princes, who by <hi>Caesars</hi> permission were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, call <hi>Luther</hi> April 24. unto them. The Bishop then in a friendly manner delt with him to desist from his resolution. But <hi>Luther</hi> giving him thankes for care of his safety, stood firmly in his former doctrine: <hi>and submitted what even he had written to Caesars and the Princes perusall, and judgement, so that they tried them by Gods word.</hi> When the Bishop asked him, <hi>what remedy he knew or could advise for these stirres? Luther</hi> answered: <hi>None other then that of Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliel in the Acts of the Apostles. If this counsel and proceeding be of Men, it will not continue: if of God, no power of man can dissolve it.</hi> And this he besought him to siguisie to the Pope. The Bishop againe said; <hi>What if the Articles were collected and submitted to the Councel? Luther</hi> answered, <hi>Yes they might, so that they were not the same which the Councel at Constance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</hi> The Bishop replying: <hi>that he feared they would be the very same. Luther</hi> couragiously answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; <hi>Those will I defend, though I was presently to die.</hi> Hereupon the Bishop quietly dismissed <hi>Luther: who intreated him, that he might have leave to returne to his friends, and have safe conduct from Caesar.</hi> The Bishop promised to obtaiue it for him, and a little
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59553:30"/>
while after sent <hi>Eckius</hi> the officer of <hi>Caesar</hi> to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie to <hi>Luther,</hi> 
               <q>that he had free liberty to depart under <hi>Caesars</hi> protection within 21. dayes: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all he was bid not to preach in his journey home, nor to write any thing, which might rayse further stirres.</q>
               <hi>Luther</hi> answered  <q>As it seemeth good to the Lord, so be it: blessed be the name of God.</q> Afterward he gave humble thankes to <hi>Caesar</hi> and the Princes, and commended himselfe to them.</p>
            <p>On the 26. of April <hi>Luther</hi> taking his leave de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from <hi>Wormes. Casp. Sturmius</hi> a Messenger <note place="margin">

At this all men stood earnestly expecting, what those thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-bolts would effect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Frederik</hi> the <hi>Elector</hi> a prudent Prince, seeing <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> to have incurred the hatred of all; that no danger might seize on him, committed the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of conveying <hi>Luther</hi> into some safe place, where he might be free from accesse, to some faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full friends of the Nobility, that there he should be kept private, till <hi>Caesar</hi> was departed out of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:59553:30"/>
They presently, faithfully, and secretly conveyed him to the Castle of <hi>Wartenburg</hi> neere <note place="margin">Luther <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to</hi> War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenburgh. Luthers Patmos.</note> 
               <hi>Isenack:</hi> This place <hi>Luther</hi> afterward used to call his <hi>Patmos.</hi> There were but eight privy to this, who did it with that secrecy that not any but themselves could know what was become of him. It is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that the Papists set their wisards on worke to descry him: but they could not certainly designe the place where he was. <hi>Luther</hi> abode in that woody wildernesse about tenne monethes: and in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirednesse wrote diverse usefull Treatises for the Church; as the <hi>Explications of the Gospels and Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi> dedicated to <hi>Albertus</hi> of <hi>Mansfield:</hi> the book <note place="margin">

Besides he cut in two the two sinnewes of the Popes kingdome, namely, <hi>Private Masses</hi> and <hi>Monastick Vowes,</hi> which books he dedicated to the <note place="margin">Private masse taken away at <hi>Wittenberg.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Augustine Friers</hi> (who in his absence abrogated private Masses and began to dispute about Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick Vowes) and to his Father. They of <hi>Wittenberg</hi> also gave a reason to the <hi>Elector</hi> why they did so: and shewed to what end Temples and Colledges were instituted at the first; that is, <hi>not for private Masses, but that young people might be there brought up piously: and that the meanes they were indowed with, were for the use of both Readers and scholars that were in want. And that this buying and selling of Masses was crept in within foure hundreth yeeres of that time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Luther</hi> found courteous entertainment and kind respect in that his wildernesse: for in his Epistles he often mentions the friendly offices of his <hi>Hoste:</hi> to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59553:31"/>
whom he preached on the Lords day and at Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luthers</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the aire and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation.</note> times in his private Chappell. Some times <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> for his healths sake went forth into the straw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry groves, and somewhat farther into the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries, which were neere, taking upon him the name <hi>Iunker George</hi> a noble man, and accompanied onely with one attendant, who was faithfull and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and would often warne <hi>Luther</hi> in the places where they were entertained, <hi>not presently to lay aside his sword, and to take in hand the books before him; for so he might be descried.</hi> Sometimes he went forth a hunting with his friends. Of this sport thus he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth. <q>I was a hunting two dayes, to see that lordly but bitter-sweet sport. Here we took two Hares, and some silly young Partridges. The sport is meet for such as have nothing else to do. There did I contemplate as a Divine amidst their nets and dogs. Nor did the outward appearance of the game more delight me, then what I concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by it, move me to pitie and griefe. For what could this sport signifie and resemble, but by the <note place="margin">Hunting is a resemblance of the devils practise.</note> dogs, wicked Popish divines, and by the nets, the cunning tricks and wiles by which they seeke to catch harmlesse Christians, as hunters those silly creatures? This was a most evident mysterie of the pursuing of plain hearted and faithfull souls. Yet was there a more cruell mysterie presented to me: When by my meanes, we kept a young Hare alive; and put her in my Coats sleeve, and so left her: in the meane time the dogs finding it, broke one of her legs, and taking her by the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59553:31"/>
as she was in the sleeve, stopt her wind. Thus it is with Satan and the Pope, who cruelly destroy poore souls without regard of my paines to save them. I was by this time weary of this sport, and thought that more pleasing, where Beares, Wolves, Bores, Foxes, and such like savage crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are strook dead with darts and arrows. It comforted me again, (for I took it as a mystery &amp; resemblance of salvation) that Hares and harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less creatures are taken by men, &amp; not by Beares, Wolves and ravenous Hawkes who resemble Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Bishops and Divines: because by these may be signified a devouring by Hell, by those an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them as food for heaven.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He passed also to <hi>Wittenberg</hi> from his <hi>Patmos</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <note place="margin">
                  <hi>He came pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately to</hi> Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenberg. Tom. 1. epist. pag. 367.

In his retirednesse he was much troubled with costivenesse, having the benefit of naturall ease that way but once in foure or five dayes: Then also was he tried by some devillish tentations, which much disquieted him. This disease he overcame by exercise, and medicines sent him from <hi>Spalatinus.</hi> Then read he also the Hebrew and Greek Bibles: and besides the books above mentioned, he wrote many letters to his friends, which be now printed.</p>
            <p>At length not enduring further delay and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, <note place="margin">He returned to <hi>Wittenberg.</hi>
               </note> he returned from his <hi>Patmos</hi> to <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> without the knowledge of the Electour. <hi>March</hi> the sixth, <hi>Ann.</hi> 1522. he rendred these reasons of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59553:32"/>
               <hi>his return to the Electour. First, said he,</hi> I am call'd <note place="margin">Tom. 2. epist. pag. 47.</note> back by the Letters of the Church and People of <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenberg,</hi> and that with much solicitation and entreaty. <hi>Secondly,</hi> at <hi>Wittenberg</hi> Satan hath made an inrode into my flock, and raised such stirres, that I cannot well represse and quiet them with my writing alone, but of necessitie I must live there, be present among them, and both heare them and speake to them, go in and out before them, and do what I can for their good. Besides I feare, that some great and violent sedition will arise in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and make <hi>Germany</hi> undergo grievous punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for its contempt and ingratitude. <hi>I</hi> thought it therefore needfull to do doe what I ought and could for them in this regard by my counsell and endeavour, to teach, admonish and exhort them, thereby to avert Gods anger and judgement, or at least to stay them a while. Furthermore, <hi>I</hi> know well, and am verily perswaded <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luthers</hi> confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying on God.</note> that my preaching, and my proceeding to divulge the Gospel of Christ is not of my own motion; but the worke of God. Nor shall any kinde of death or persecution shake this my confidence, and make me thinke otherwise; and <hi>I</hi> conceive that <hi>I</hi> rightly divine that no terrours or cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie can put out the light already shining. <hi>And in an other Epistle. I</hi> return to <hi>Wittenberg</hi> under a more sublime and strong protection, then the <hi>Elector</hi> of <hi>Saxonie</hi> can give me. Nor did <hi>I</hi> ever minde to sue for defence from your Highnesse. Moreover did <hi>I</hi> know that your Highness would and could defend me, verily <hi>I</hi> would not returne. No sword can advance and maintaine this cause. God alone can order and promote it, without any mans excessive care and helpfull hand. Therefore in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59553:32"/>
this cause he that most strongly trusts to Gods assistance, he most surely defendeth himself and others. Seeing therefore <hi>I</hi> perceive your Highnesse to be weake in faith, <hi>I</hi> can by no meanes attribute so much to your Highnesse, as to be perswaded that <hi>I</hi> can be defended and freed from danger by you. <hi>I</hi> will keep your Highnesse person, your minde and body, and estate safe from all danger and damage in this my cause, whether you beleeve me or not. Let your Highnesse then be assured and not doubt at all, that this matter is farre otherwise concluded of in heaven, then at <hi>Norimberg.</hi> For we shall finde, that they which think they have devoured all the Gospel and queld it in the rising, are not yet come to the <hi>Benedicite. I</hi> have to deale with another manner and more powerfull Prince, then our Duke. He knoweth me, and <hi>I</hi> him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently well. Did your Highnesse beleeve, you should behold the wonderfull works and glory of God: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you not yet beleeving, see none of these things. To God be glory and praise for ever. This and much more to this purpose he wrote, shewing his full assurance and plerophory of faith most admirable. <hi>He also wrote thus to</hi> Melancthon <hi>concerning the cause of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</hi> Provide a lodging for me, for the Translation of <note place="margin">Another cause of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> return.</note> the Bible compels me to return to you: pray to God that it may stand with his good pleasure. <hi>I</hi> desire to conceale my self, as much as I can, yet will <hi>I</hi> proceed in my worke resolved upon. <hi>He wrote the like to</hi> Amsdorf: <hi>That</hi> for the translation of the Bible he must return to <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenberg,</hi> that therein he might use other mens counsell and help.</p>
            <p>Luther <hi>being returned, from the Lords Day first</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:59553:33"/>
in Lent that whole weeke every day preached one Sermon; these are extant: and in them he shewed what he liked or disliked in the alterations made in his absence. He found fault with them, <hi>who had ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated private Masse and Idols, and administred the Lords Supper in both kinds, and taken away auricular confession, differences of meats, invocation of Saints, and other the like matters; not because they had done im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piously, but because they proceeded not herein orderly.</hi> 
               <q>He affirmed that he condemned the Papisticall Masse, the worshipping of Images, the rules of auricular confession, prayer to Saints, the Popish fasting: but he did condemne them onely by the Word of God preached, and not by a violent ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation of them. How much he prevailed by those Sermons, he telleth in these words. I, saith he, gave offence to <hi>Carolostade,</hi> because I blamed <note place="margin">

                  </note> his proceedings, though I condemned not his doctrin. Onely this disliked me, that dealing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ceremonies and outward matters, he labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lesse in that which is Christian doctrin indeed, namely, faith and charitie: for by his unadvised course of teaching, he brought the people to this passe, that he thought himselfe a Christian by these petty matters, by communicating in both kinds, by not using confession, and by breaking down images, &amp;c.</q> And this was the beginning of dissention between <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Carolostade.</hi>

               <hi>Bohemians</hi> concerning matters of great moment: and <hi>exhorted them to constancie in the truth, which they had received, and that they would not fall back to Antichrist for a vain hope of peace: He also disswaded them from making themselves guiltie of the innocent blood of</hi> John Hus <hi>and</hi> Jerome <hi>of</hi> Prague. <hi>And where as some objected their many different Sects; he shewed that there were many more among the Papists: and prescribed the</hi> Bohemians <hi>a course, how they might cure this disease.</hi> Here he inveighed earnestly against such Bishops, as did condemne and persecute the doctrin of the Gospel: and being often provoked did neither defend their own doctrin, nor refute <hi>Luthers.</hi> He shewed them that by their tyranny they should not prevaile: because he was neither moved by the Popes Anathema or curse, nor Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars proscription,<q>and that he would endeavour so much the more to propagate the Gospel, and set to it with the more courage, by how much the more violently they withstood it: and that the Gospel would not be extinguished, though they should kill him: and that God would plague them most conspicuously and grievously, if they proceeded in their furious course.</q> In this booke he so angred the then Bishops, Abbats, Monks, and the whole dregs of them, that they resolved that seeing they could not burne <hi>Luther</hi> himself, they would burne all his books.</p>

Of the same thus <hi>Eras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> wrote. <hi>If</hi> Luther <hi>first commending the godly care of the King, had afterward with solid arguments refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his opinions, and laid no disgrace on the Kings per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, I suppose he had done that which would much have advanced his cause.</hi> Againe. <hi>What set</hi> Luther <hi>on, to say in his book against the King? Let your Highnesse come to me, and I will teach you. Truely the Kings book was written in a good Latine style, and not unlearnedly. Luther</hi> thus excuseth this his fact. <hi>If any man be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended</hi>

               <hi>at my sharpnesse towards the King, I thus answer him. In that book I have to do with senselesse monsters, who contemne my best and most modest writings, and my humble submission, and are more hardened by my calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Besides I abstained from bitter speeches and lyes, with which the Kings book is full fraught: nor is it any great matter, if I give no more respect to an earthly King, and speake sharply, seeing he was not afraid to</hi>

               </note> the Emperour being absent, the decree made at <hi>Wormes</hi> was disannulled.

               <hi>one should suspect, that this was done to hinder the free preaching of the Gospel:</hi> that the Printers should im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print, or divulge nothing, but what was allowed and approved by learned and judicious men; that the Priests who had married wives, should be amerced according to the award of the Popes lawes.

            <p>This yeere was remarkable for the unhappy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentary controversie; The beginning and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding whereof is related in the life of <hi>Carolostade, Zwingl.</hi> and <hi>Oecolamp.</hi> and I list not here to renew our griefe by opening the sore again.</p>
            <p>About this time came forth the fanatick writing of <hi>Tho. Muncer</hi> of <hi>Stolberg,</hi> and the Preacher of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stet:</hi> in which he disgorged his venemous fury a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <note place="margin">

The same <hi>Muncer</hi> wrote to <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon</hi> a letter plainly shewing his fanaticall spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Luther</hi> now put forth <hi>Davids Psalter</hi> in the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> tongue, &amp; a book against the seditious, and an <note place="margin">The <hi>Psalmes</hi> put forth, &amp;c.</note> Epistle to <hi>Frederik</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> Princes of <hi>Saxony</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the enemies of images, and Enthusiasts, who boasted of illumination and conference with God.

            <p>This yeere in <hi>October, Luther</hi> laid aside his Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kishhood:

and declared his judgement concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Synode to be called for determination of <note place="margin">

In the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodes after this they never disputed about faith; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes about opinions and questions, that the name of Councels is more suspected and hated by me then the name of free will. If one Church will not of its own accord imitate another in externall matters, what need is there to compell them by the decrees of Councels, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently are changed into lawes and snares to intangle mens soules. Rather let one Church freely follow the good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of another, or let each Church enjoy her owne wayes, so that the unitie of the spirit be kept intire in faith by the word of God, though there be diversitie and</hi>

But when his face was besprinckled with cold water by</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas <hi>(for so</hi> Luth. <hi>had bidden) he came again to himself: and began to pray most earnestly, and to make a confession of his faith; &amp; to say, that he was unworthy of Martirdom, which by his proceedings he might seemed to run upon.</hi>

               <note place="margin">The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</note> according to <hi>Luthers</hi> direction and advise, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in the <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>German</hi> tongues in <hi>Caesars</hi> palace, <hi>Ian.</hi> 25. at 2. a clock in the afternoone: and was read by the Chancellor of <hi>Saxony</hi> before <hi>Charls</hi> the fifth, <hi>Ferdinando</hi> and all the Electors &amp; Princes being assessors, &amp; that with so shrill &amp; loud a voice, that not onely in that large hall, but also in the Court beneath and in the places adjoyning it was well heard. They who subscribed to this Confession <note place="margin">Who subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to it.</note> were <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony, George</hi> Marquesse of <hi>Brandenburgh, Ernest</hi> and <hi>Francis</hi> brothers, Dukes of <hi>Brunswick</hi> and <hi>Lunenburgh; Philip</hi> Landgrave of <hi>Hassia, Wolfgang</hi> Prince of <hi>Anhalt;</hi> and two Cities of the Empire, <hi>Norinberg</hi> and <hi>Reutling.</hi> After it was read, the Princes judgement was threefold. First, Some thought fit that the Decree of <hi>Wormes</hi> should be pressed, and the refractary compelled to it. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Others would have had the Confession ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined by learned and pious men, and then to be delivered to <hi>Caesar.</hi> Thirdly, Some desired that the Papists should exhibite a confutation of it to the Potestants: and that the whole cause should be

left to <hi>Caesars</hi> judgement: To this last most of the <note place="margin">It was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Papist to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute it if they could.</note> Princes agreed. Thereupon the Pontifician Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines (of whom <hi>Iohn Faber</hi> and <hi>Eckius</hi> were chief) were iujoyned to prepare their confutation. They wrote many things bitterly against the Protestants, and rather multiplied revilings then arguments. When therefore they were bid to new mould their writings, the publication of the Pontifician refuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was deferred seven weekes from the exhibiting of the Confession.</p>

us of breach of our covenant, and unconstancy, if we observe not what they please. For they will take our graunts in the large, larger, largest sense: and hold their own strictly, more strictly, and as strictly as they can. In briefe, I wholly dislike this agitation for concord in doctrin, as being a thing utterly impossible, unlesse the Pope will abolish his Popedome. Concerning the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation, this should have been added, that it was a very cold one. Of it thus</hi> Luther <hi>wrote to</hi> Melancthon. <hi>Grace and peace in Christ the Lord over his enemies. I thanke God, who permitted our Adversaries to devise so fond a confutation.

            </p>
            <p>The issue of all came to this, that though the Protestants did desire peace of Caesar, and space <note place="margin">The issue of matters in this assembly.</note> farther to deliberate of the matter, they could not obtain their desire. <hi>The Confession it self was reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and all who assented to it, unlesse they suffered all matters to run in their old Tenour, were brought into ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of their lives and States: therewere some also ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to execute Caesars decree.</hi> Whereas therefore it was daily exspected, that the Protestants should be warred against by the Pontificians: <hi>Luther</hi> soon after the Assembly with a noble and Heroik spirit set forth a book to the <hi>Germans,</hi> whose title was <note n="*" place="margin">Luthers <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition</hi> ad Germanos.</note>

               <hi>very expressions? with such reverence he sueth for any thing, as one begging of God; and yet with such hope and assurance, as if he spake with a loving father or friend.

If so be thou please not so to doe, thy danger will be joyned with ours: this businesse is wholly thine: we adventured not on it, but were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled thereunto.

When I heard him praying in this manner with a cleare voyce as I stood a farre off, my mind also was inflamed with a singular kind of ardency: because I observed how passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, how gravely, how reverently, he in his prayer spake of God, and urged Gods promises out of the Psalmes, as one assured, that what he asked, should come to passe.</hi> I <hi>doubt not therefore, but that his prayers will much advance and further the desperate cause treated of at the Assembly.</hi> When in that assembly the chiefe and almost the sole dissention between <hi>Luther</hi> and the <hi>Protestants</hi> was about <hi>the Lords supper:</hi> this liked the Papists, but grieved the Potestants. <hi>Bucer</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the consent of the Duke of <hi>Sanony</hi> and his Magistrates consent, went from <hi>Auspurg</hi> to <hi>Coburg</hi> to see what agreement could be made betweene <note place="margin">

This Article, will they nill they, will stand: Hell gates cannot prevayle against it. The spirit of God doth dictate this unto me, this is the true Gospel. For thus the Article in the mouth of all Christian children hath it. I beleeve in Iesus Christ crucified and dead. Now no man died for our sinnes but Iesus Christ the sonne of God, the one and onely sonne of God: I say it again &amp; again, Iesus the one and onely son of God redeemed us from our sinnes. This is most surely grounded &amp; undoubted Doctrin: this the whole scripture crieth out aloud, though the devils &amp; all the world storme and burst with anger at it. And if he alone take away the sinnes of the world, we verily cannot doe it with our workes. and it is impossible that I can lay hold on Christ otherwise then by faith: he is never apprehended by my good workes. And seeing faith alone layeth hold on our Redeemer, and not our workes the concomitants of our faith, it abideth undoubted truth; that faith alone</hi>

               <hi>Luther</hi> wrote Articles concerning the chiefe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted heads of Christian doctrine.

Your letter expressing your recovery put cheerfulnesse into the countenances of the Princes and all good men: they all acknowledg that the light of the Gospel hath been in these dayes made known to the world by your Ministry, and know that they are beholding to you for it: and fore see what a losse it would be to the Church if they should lose you.

            <p>Here the Pope rejourned the meeting of the <note place="margin">An. 1537.</note> Synod from the first of <hi>November</hi> to the first of <hi>May</hi> the yeere following: and designed the place for it to be <hi>Vincentia</hi> a large and renowned City of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and sent thither some of the Cardinals to begin the Councel.

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59553:57"/>
and as soone as it was taken notice of in <hi>Germany, Luther</hi> in the vulgar tongue, and <hi>Iohn Sturmius</hi> in Latine wrote to the Reformers an answer. <hi>Luthers</hi> booke by a picture in the frontispice shewed its ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. <note place="margin">

At length all that reformation came to nothing, by whose policy and tricks it is well enough knowne. <hi>Luther</hi> now divulged one of the chiefe Articles of the Papists belief (namely, concerning <hi>Constantines donation)</hi> with annotations confuting it, for the Pontificians sake. He published also some <hi>Epistles of Iohn Hus,</hi> which were sent to the <hi>Bohemians</hi> in the prison at <hi>Constance, An.</hi> 1516. and wrote a preface to the Spiritualty, who would be present at the <note place="margin">The Legend of <hi>Iohn Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom.</hi>

               <hi>taught that the Gospel was not to be taught to any, but to such as were humbled by the Law.

And shewed that the Law was not given, that we might be justified by it, but to shew us our sinnes, and to terrifie our consciences. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law was first to be taught, and the Gospel afterward, which sheweth the Mediator. <hi>Iohn A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gricola</hi> being better instructed by <hi>Luther</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged his errour, and revoked it under his owne hand in publique.</p>

After Easter, <hi>Bernard</hi> the infant sonne of <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Anhalt</hi> was baptized at <hi>Dessaw.</hi> Here <hi>Luther</hi> preached two Sermons to the Courtiers, the Brother of the Prince of <hi>Anhalt,</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Brandenburgh:</hi> which were printed. He wrote also an Answer to a
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59553:60"/>
rayling book of one, whom he calleth <hi>Hans Wurst.</hi>

                  </gap>udding.</note> Wherein he defended himself and his doctrin, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Papists and their Popish errours. He put <note place="margin">Tom. 7. <hi>Ien.</hi>
               </note> forth also an Exhortation to prayer against the Turk: and answered the Princes questions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Transubstantiation, Free-will. Justification by faith, and other points.</p>
            <p>About this time the Bishoprick of <hi>Neoburg,</hi> by <hi>Sala,</hi> was voyd; There <hi>Nicolas Amsdorf</hi> a Divine born of a noble Family, was enstalled by <hi>Luther,</hi> at <note place="margin">An. 1542.</note> the command of the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> the Patron of that Diocesse, and <hi>Iulius Pflugius,</hi> whom the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the Colledge chose, was refused. <hi>Luther</hi> placed him in the Bishoprick, <hi>Ian.</hi> 20. <hi>An.</hi> 1542. This thing, as many conceived, gave occasion to other stirres: and very much offended the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, who much affected <hi>Pfugius</hi> for divers respects. Of this see more in <hi>Amsdorfs</hi> life. After this <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> wrote a book in the <hi>German</hi> tongue, and call'd it, <hi>The Pattern of the inauguration of a true Christian Bishop.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He published at that time the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> which by <note place="margin">The <hi>Alcoran</hi> in the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> tongue.</note> 
               <hi>Richard</hi> a <hi>Dominican</hi> was translated into the vulgar tongue: He added to it <hi>a faithfull admonition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the abandoning the Turks doctrin,</hi> and affirmed <hi>that not the Turk, but the Pope was Antichrist.</hi> And upon a difference rising between the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Maurice</hi> concerning the territories and town of <hi>Wurcen;</hi> so that warre was likely to ensue; <hi>Luther</hi> with weightie reasons in his letters disswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded both the Princes from their designes.

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59553:60"/>
also opened his judgement about a Position some yeeres agone by him propounded: Namely, <hi>that to warre against the Turk was nothing else but to fight against God, who useth him as his whip to scourge us.</hi> Now also he wrote a consolatory letter concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abortive birthes and bringing forth dead chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p>The yeers 1543 and 44, produced many great troubles and stirres. For now the Sacramentary <note place="margin">An. 1543.</note> contention began afresh, to <hi>Melancthons</hi> great grief: whom some attempted to set at jarres with <hi>Luther.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Camerarius</hi> in the life of <hi>Melancthon.</hi>
               </note> Some there were also, who sought to coole <hi>Luthers</hi> heat, and spake little more favourably of the <hi>Rhenan</hi> Churches, then of the Turks. Wherefore when <hi>Christopher Froschoverus</hi> the Printer of <hi>Tigur</hi> sent <hi>Luther</hi> a copie of his <hi>Tigurin</hi> Bible then Printed; <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luther</hi> to the Printer to <hi>Tigur.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Luther</hi> admonished him by his letter, <hi>that he should not publish anything, which came to him from the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of</hi> Tigur: <hi>and that he had nothing to do with them, nor would receive or read their books: that the Churches of God could not joyne in Communion with them, who already were running into the way of Perdition, and would bring others into hell and damnation:</hi> and that he would oppugne them with his prayers and books whilest he lived. And now <hi>Luther</hi> first wrote against <note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>He wrote also his minde to others concerning <note place="margin">His judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about ceremonies and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication.</note> the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>excommunication:</hi> he desired that there should be few Ceremonies, and they tending to edification, and that excommunication should be brought into the Church as a profitable discipline: but could scarce hope to see it. He admonished the young students at <hi>Wittenberg</hi> to avoyd fornication, with w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> some then were taxed: yea he threatned that he would hold no societie with men of that ill condition: and tarried some time at <hi>Mersburg</hi>

            <p>This yeere in <hi>Italy</hi> was spread a most impudent lie about <hi>Luthers</hi> death: The summe of it transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">The lye in <hi>Italy</hi> about <hi>Luthers</hi> death.</note> out of the <hi>Italian</hi> is this.</p>

               <q>A stupendious &amp; rare miracle which God ever to be praised, shewed about the filthy death of <note place="margin">Tom. 8. Jen. p. 206.</note> 
                  <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> a man damned both in body and soule, so that it conduced to the glory of Jesus Christ, and the amendment and comfort of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men. When <hi>Martin Luther</hi> was sick, he desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Lords body to be communicated to him, which he receiving, died presently. When he saw that he must die; he requested that his body might be set upon the Altar, and be adored with divine worship. But God to put an end to his horrible errours, by a great miracle warned the people to abstain from the impietie, which <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> invented: For when his body was laid in his grave: suddenly so great a stirre and terrour
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:59553:62"/>
arose, as if the foundations of the earth were sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken together. Whereupon all at the funerall trembling, were astonished, and after a while lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up their eyes, beheld the sacred hoste appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ayre. Wherefore with great devotion of heart, they placed the most sacred Host in the holy Altar. Whereupon the fearefull noyse cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. But in the night following a loud noyse and ratling much shriller then the former was heard about the sepulcher of <hi>Luther,</hi> which awaked all the Citie, terrified them, and almost kill'd them with astonishment. In the morning when they opened the sepulcher, they found neither his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, nor his bones, nor any of the cloathes: but there came a sulphurous stinke out thereof, which almost overcame the standers by. By this mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle many were so amazed, that they amended their lives for the honour of the Christian faith, and the glory of Jesus Christ.</q> When this lye came Printed into <hi>Germany, Luther</hi> did subscribe with his own hand, words to this purpose.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Martin Luther <hi>doe professe and witnesse under mine owne hand, that I on the 21. day of</hi> March <hi>recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this figment full of anger and fury concerning my death, and that I read it with a joyfull mind, and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full countenance: And but that I detest the blasphemy, which ascribeth an impudent lie to the divine Majestie, for the other passages, I cannot but with great joy of heart laugh at Sataus, the Popes, and their complices hatred against me. God turne their hearts from their dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall maliciousnesse. But if God decree not to heare</hi>

               <hi>my prayers for their sinne unto death: then God graunt that they may fill up the measure of their sinnes, and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace themselves to the full with their libels, full fraught with such like lies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This yeere <hi>Luther</hi> set forth a book intituled, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Popedome ordained by the Devill.</hi> In this he treats of the Councel appointed by the Pope, and often adjourned, or translated from place to place, and of other plots of the Popes.

               </note> of the <hi>Campanian,</hi> who comming out of <hi>Germany</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> turned his bare breech towards <hi>Germany,</hi> using words to the disgrace of the nation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Luther</hi> published divers other Treatises as the explication of Christs speech. <hi>Search the scriptures:</hi> And <hi>The blindnesse and ingratitude of the world,</hi> in handling Christs complaint of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> By <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> advice especially, <hi>Georgius Anhaltenus</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke the government of the Church of <hi>Mersberg.</hi> Of this is spoken in the life of Duke <hi>George.</hi>

But using some meanes for cure of his infirmity, he sate at supper with the company: and so continued to do from the 29. of <hi>Ianuary</hi> to the 17. of <hi>February,</hi> and treated of the differences, for whose determination he came thither. In this time he preached sometimes, and twice received the Lords supper, and publikely received two students into the <hi>sacred order of the Ministery.</hi> And at his lodging used much godly conference at Table with his friends, and every day devoutly prayed.

He said. <hi>What befell Adam? he never saw Eve, but was at rest in a deep sleep, when God formed her, yet when he awaked and saw her, he asketh not; what she was, or whence she was? but saith, that she was flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone. Now how knew he that? He being full of the Holy Ghost, and endued with the knowledge of God, thus spake. After the same manner we also shall be in the other life renewed by Christ; and shall know our parents, our wives, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and all about us, much more perfectly, then Adam knew Eve at her bringing to him.</hi>

            <p>Thus <hi>Luther</hi> ran his course, &amp; this was the period of his travels.

               <hi>blessing on us in restoring to us the Gospel.</hi> Secondly, <hi>security, which already commonly and every where raigneth.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>worldly wisdome, which would bring all things into good order, and cure the publique stirres with wicked Councels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was in this worthy man of God a quicke <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luthers</hi> ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</note> and prudent understanding, a magnanimous and noble Spirit. He was ever constant in known truth: from the confession whereof he could never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved <note place="margin">His constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the truth.</note> with threats or promises. So that when up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a time, one Papist demanded of an other, <hi>Why do you not stop the mans mouth with gold and silver?</hi> The other answered: See, this <hi>German beast careth not for money.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There appeared in him a singular proofe of his valour and noble courage in the <hi>Auspurg</hi> Assembly, when thus he wrote out of his Wildernesse to <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinus.</hi>

For thereupon followeth, that he that dwels in heaven laughes at them. And when our Lord and King laughes, I see no cause, why we should weep before their faces. He laughes not for his own sake, but for ours, that we rather trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him then to any thing else, might laugh at their vain designs: so much need is there of faith, that the cause of faith may not be looked upon without faith. But he that begun this worke, he began it without our counsell and contrivance; And he himself will forward with it, and finish it without, and beyond all our counsels and devises: of this I make no question; I know and am assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hereof. He in whom I beleeve, is able to do above all, which we can aske or conceive. Though <hi>Philip Melancthon</hi> contrive and desire that God should work according to, and within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of his counsels, that he might have wherein to glory: and say. Surely thus the businesse should be carried: Thus would I have done. But this is not well spoken: I <hi>Philip</hi> would have it so: This (I) is too flat and dull, too low a style. It must be thus. The God, who saith, I am that I am; this is his name, <hi>I am;</hi> He will have it so. It is not yet seen who he is, but he will appear, as he is, and we shall see him. But I have done. Be you vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant in the Lord, and put <hi>Melancthon</hi> in minde from me, that he set not himself in Gods place:
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59553:67"/>
but fight against that ambition of Deitie, which was inbred and took root in us in Paradise by the devils suggestion: for that is an affectation not furthering the businesse now in hand. The desire of being like God, thrust <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> out of Paradise, and it alone doth trouble us, and turn us out of the course of Peace. We must be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall men, and not Gods: Thus in briefe: If we think otherwise, everlasting unquietnesse and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish of heart will be our reward.</q>

Also he calleth Indulgence-Mongers, <hi>purse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threshers,</hi> because the Pope winnowed good money out of that chaffe.

If he had not revived Religion, if he had preached no Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; had he written nothing else, but what he divulged of the Scriptures translated, yet for this his paines, he deserved very excellent and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall glory.

               <q>Yet do not I deny, but that I am more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement then is fit: which thing seeing they know so well, they should refraine from provoking me: How hard a thing it is to bridle the pen, you may well enough learne by your selfe.

Whereupon it fell out that had I not been apt by nature to vehemency and imbittering my style, the very indignity of the matter would have urged a dead and stony heart to write sharply: how much more my selfe, who am of an ardent spirit, &amp; write not a dul stile. Monsters of men carried me beyond the due temper of modesty.</q> For the warrant of this sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes he used to allead ge the example of Christ, who called the Jewes, <hi>an adulterous &amp; perverse generation, a generation of Vipers, hypocrites, children of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill:</hi>

Further he had divers spirituall tentations and terrible buffets of Satan: as namely in his sicknesse at <hi>Coburg,</hi> and at other times, when his body was weake. These much afflicted him, and sometimes made him lie as one dead; but by physick applyed for his cure, and reading the Scripture, and singing of Psalmes, which he used to call them about him unto, he was recovered, and eased of those affrights, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed them but as the Devils traps, from which God would deliver him.</p>
            <p>In the dismall warre of <hi>Germany,</hi> scarce could the souldiers be restrained from exercising their <note place="margin">

For when <hi>Wittenberg</hi> yeelded to the Emperour <hi>Charles:</hi> and he came to see the towne; the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would have digged up <hi>Luthers</hi> tombe, and burnt his body, <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth (as faithfull witnesses have related) said. <hi>Suffer him to rest till the day of resurrection, and the Iudgement of all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in the beginning of <hi>Luthers</hi> preaching, he minded not to have proceeded so farre, as the issue drew him to. For <hi>An.</hi> 1520. he thus wrote. I <hi>will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi>

Tom. 1. ep. pag. 130.</note> and could not wind himselfe out of some errours in the beginning presently: for about the <hi>invocation</hi> of Saints thus he wrote <hi>An.</hi> 1518. <q>My good <hi>Spalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> I never judged, that the worship of Saints was superstitious, nor the praying to them for matters especially pertaining to the body. For thus our neighbours the <hi>Pighards</hi> hereticks in <hi>Boemia</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit. For we in better manner obtaine of God by his Saints any good thing (for assuredly all good is Gods gift) then others get by <hi>Magicians</hi> and <hi>Wisards</hi> of the Devill, as the manner is. But this my meaning was, that it is superstitious, yea ungodly &amp; wicked to beg of God and the Saints things corporall onely, and to neglect the things which concerne the soule and salvation, and are sued for according to Gods will: As if we forgot or beleeved not his word, saying; Seeke first or cheifely the kingdome of God, and all these
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59553:72"/>
things shall be added to you. Yea every where Christ teacheth us to slight corporall matters, and our bodies, as base things in regard of our soules.</q> Concerning the adoration in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament thus he wrote. <q>I say <note n="a" place="margin">Tom. 2. ep. pag. 72.</note> it is free for us to adore Christ, and call upon him <hi>sub sacramento</hi> under the Sacrament.

Now seeing you have attained both the free use and Elegancy of the <hi>German</hi> tongue, I intreat you to take some paines with us in this businesse, and try how you can turn a Psalme into verse: as I have given you a pattern. I would have you not to use late invented and courtly termes: But make the verse to sit the simplest and most vulgar capacitie: yet let the words be smooth and proper. Let the sense also be cleare, and as neere as may be to the originall: yet may you use this freedome, as to vary the words sometimes, so that you keep the sense.

He was by nature (which <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon</hi> would often wonder at) a moderate eater and drinker: and yet had no small or weake body: He hath beene seene for foure dayes together and <note place="margin">His tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> being in health, to eate and drinke nothing at set meale times: and often at other times for many dayes to be content with a little bread and fish. I will say nothing how in the Cloysters he macerated
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59553:76"/>
himselfe with watchings, fasting, labours. Often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times being invited to banquets, he went not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note place="margin">Tom. 1. ep. p. 265.</note> he would not lose his time, I, sayd he, <hi>lose too much time by invitations to feasts here in the City: I know Satan hath such an hand in it: that I may not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it, and yet it doth me harme to accept the courtesy.</hi> In company he was familiar, pleasant, courteous, yet grave, as beseemed a man of his place. He was affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and studious of truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Melancthon</hi> affirmeth, that he often found him at prayer with great ardency and teares imploring <note place="margin">His zeale in prayer.</note> God for the whole Church. He set apart every day a certain time for reading some Psalmes, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt his owne <hi>prayers and teares</hi> with them. He of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten used to say; that he was offended with them, who either through idlenesse or variety of imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment sayd, that it was enough to pray with groanes onely. And for that end, said he, formes of prayer are prescribed us by the will of God, that reading might inflame our minds, yea that the voice also might professe, what God we call upon.</p>
            <p>When he recreated his mind, and tooke it of <note place="margin">His recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> from study, he delighted to play at <hi>Chesse,</hi> and was skilfull at it. He sometimes practised the art of Turning with his servant <hi>Wolfgang:</hi> and would say: <hi>if the world should deny us sustenance for my paines in Gods word, we would learne to get our livings with our hands.</hi> Sometimes he did play on an <hi>Instrument,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Tom. 2. ep. p. 293. and 334.</note> sometimes <hi>shoote.</hi> He was carefull also of the neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of <hi>his garden,</hi> and desired of his friends varietie of plants to furnish it: So that he had no

vacant time. <hi>Of his imployments thus he writeth. I am very full of imployment: the</hi> Psalter <hi>requireth a</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Tom 2. ep. p. 365.</note> 
               <hi>whole man: preaching to the people might well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire all my paines: my course of worshipping God and prayer might wholly busie me: my paines in expounding Scripture by writing, my writing Epistles, my care of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens affaires taketh up my time; my converse with my friends (which I use to call a feeding of my corps) doth very badly steale away a great part of my time.</hi> It was his usuall course either to meditate, or to read, or preach, or to give good counsel to his friends: so that he was never idle.</p>
            <p>He was very liberall to the poore. On a time when a student asked some money of him, he bad <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luthers</hi> libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality.</note> his wife give him some thing: and when she excused the matter in regard of their penurie at that time: he tooke up a silver cup and gave it to the Scholler, and bid him sell it to the Gold-smith, and keep the money for his occasions. When a friend sent him 200. angels of gold from the metal-mines, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed them all on poore students: When <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Electour</hi> gave him a new gowne: he said, <hi>that he was made to much of: for if here we receive a full recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence</hi>

He tooke nothing of Printers for his copies, as he writeth, saying. <hi>I have</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Tom. 2. ep. pag. 342.</note> 
               <hi>no plenty of money: and thus yet I deale with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: I receive nothing from them for recompence of my</hi>

For what should</hi> I <hi>doe with so much money?</hi> I <hi>gave one halfe of it to</hi> P. Prior, <hi>and made him a joyfull man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was very lovingly affectioned towards his <note place="margin">His loving affection to his children.</note> children, and gave them liberall education: He kept in his house a Schoole-master to traine them up in good arts and a godly life. When he saw <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen</hi> his eldest daughter ready to die, he read to her that in <hi>Esay</hi> 26. 19. <hi>Thy dead servants shall rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, together with my dead body shall they arise. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake and sing ye that dwell in the dust: For thy dew is as the dew of hearbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead. Come my people, enter into thy chambers, and shut thy doores about thee: Hide thy selfe as it were for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle moment, untill the indignation be over-past.</hi> My daughter <hi>enter thou into thy chamber with peace:</hi> I <hi>shall ere long be with thee. For God will not permit me to see the punishments hanging over the head of</hi> Germany. And upon this wept plentifully. But in publique when he went along with the Herse he bridled his affection, and was not seene to shed one teare. And as all men of excellent spirits have a zealous anger in due place. So <hi>Luther</hi> by nature was vehement, but <note place="margin">His anger &amp; zeale.</note>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:59553:77"/>
yet placable: As appearethin this, that when <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon</hi> much moved to passion once came unto him, and all the rest were very mute, <hi>Luther</hi> ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered this verse.</p>

            </q>
            <p>And then smiling said, <hi>we will not further dispute of this matter,</hi> and turned his speech to other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions.</p>
            <p>He foresaw and foretold many things, as the combustion which rose in <hi>Germany;</hi> saying, <hi>I am very much afraid, that if the Princes give eare to Duke</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Tom. 2. epist. p. 10. &amp; p. 207.</note> George <hi>his ill counsell, there will arise some tumult, which will destroy all the Princes and Magistrates in all Germany, and ingage in it all the Clergy.</hi> Of the death of <hi>Frederik</hi> Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> thus he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth. <hi>If God in heaven hath resolved in wrath to deale</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Of the covetousnesse of <hi>Germany</hi> and the dearth there, thus he speaketh. <q>We feare famine, and we shall suffer it, and finde no remedie for it. And <note place="margin">Tom. 2. epist. pag. 207.</note> when as without necessitie, we are solicitous to prevent famine, like wicked and incredulous Gentiles, and neglect the word of God and his work; he will permit shortly a dismall day to come upon us, which will bring with it whole Wain-loads of cares; which we shall neither have
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59553:78"/>
power or meanes to escape.</q> Divers other things he also foretold.</p>
            <p>He had his health competently well, but that sometimes he was troubled with headach, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Of <hi>Luthers</hi> Health.</note> in his elder yeeres. Whereupon he was afraid of some violent Apoplexie: and when he felt a swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in his head, or noyse in his eares, he used to say: <hi>Lord Iesu, smite me gently, for I am absolved from my sins according to thy word, and am fed unto life eternall by thy body and bloud. Thine Apostle</hi> John <hi>and our Elector were taken out of this world, by this kinde of death.</hi> He endured often tentations, whereupon he said: <hi>All here are in health except</hi> Luther, <hi>who is sound in body, and without suffers at no mans hand in the world: onely the Devil and all his Angels vex him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was of an indifferent stature, of strong body, <note place="margin">Of <hi>Luthers</hi> person.</note> of so Lionlike a quicknesse of his eyes, that some could not endure to look directly upon him, when he intentively beheld them. They say that one of mild spirit, who could not endure in private to talk with <hi>Luther;</hi> was courteously used by <hi>Luther,</hi> yet was so pierced with the quicknesse of his eyes, that being amazed he knew no course better then to run from him. His voyce was mild and not very cleare, whereupon, when on a time there was men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at table about <hi>Pauls</hi> voyce, which was not very perfect and full: <hi>Luther</hi> said; <hi>I also have a lowe speech and pronuntiation.</hi> To whom <hi>Melancthon</hi> answered. <hi>But this small voyce is heard very farre and neere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In wedlock he lived chastly and godly above <note place="margin">Of his wife and children after his death.</note> twentie yeers, and when he died, left three sonnes
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:59553:78"/>
and <hi>Catharin de Bora</hi> a widow, who lived after his death seven yeeres. To her it was a great grief that her husband died in a place farre from her, so that she could not be with him, and performe the last conjugall offices to him in his sicknesse. In the time of the warre which presently followed, she wandred up and down with her orphans, and in banishment was exposed to many difficulties and dangers: And besides the miseries of widowhood, which are full many, the ingratitude of many did much afflict her: for where she hoped for kindnesse in regard of her husbands worthy and noble deserts of Gods Church, often she was put of with great indignitie. When afterward her house at <hi>Wittenberg</hi> in time of pestilence was infected, she for her childrens safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as became a godly mother, betooke her self to <hi>Torg,</hi> where was also an Universitie. But in the way, when the horses affrighted ran out and seemed to indanger the waggon, she amazed not so much for her own, as her childrens preservation, lept out of the waggon, whereby poore wretch she grievously bruised her body in the fall, and being cast into a poole of cold water, caught thereby a disease, of w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> she lay sick three monethes in banishment, and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away at length died quietly in the yeere, 1552.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Luthers</hi> writings were published at <hi>Wittenberg</hi> and <hi>Iene</hi> in severall Towns both in Latine and the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luthers</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</note> German tongue. Part of them were expositions of Scriptures, part doctrinall, part polemicall. Of these this was his own judgement. <hi>Above all I beseech the godly Reader, and I beseech him for our Lord Iesus</hi>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:59553:79"/>
Christs sake, that he would read my writings judiciously, and with much pittying my case. And let him know, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>His judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them in the</hi> Praes. <hi>of</hi> Tom. 1. Lat. <hi>Work printed at</hi> Wittenberg.</note> that I was formerly a Monk and a most furious Papist, when I first entred into the cause undertaken by me: yea, I was so drunk &amp; drowned in the opinions of Papisme, that I was most ready to kill all men, if I could, or to assist and consent to their attempts that did kill them, who even in one syllable should dissent from the Pope. Such a <hi>Saul</hi> was I, as some that be yet alive. I was not so cold and calme in defending Popery as was <hi>Eckius</hi> and his mates, who more truly for their bellies sake seemed to defend Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, then that they were serious in the cause: yea they seeme still to me to laugh at the Pope in secret, as Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans. But I proceeded in the Popes defence earnestly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I set before mine eyes the last day of judgement, and trembled there at: and desired from my very heart to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain salvation. <hi>In another of his writings, he in a manner wisheth his books extinct, saying.</hi> Alas, my <note place="margin">Tom. 7. Jen. Germ. p. 288.</note> friends should not trouble me: I have enough to do with the Papists, and might almost say with <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Jeremy,</hi> would I had not been born, yea almost say, I would I had not published so many books: and would not care, if they were all perished. Let other such spirited mens writings <note place="margin">The Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians.</note> be sold in every shop, as they desire.</p>
            <p>Luther <hi>also was much against it, that any man should be called a Lutheran after his name.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the doctrin was not his, neither did he die for any <note place="margin">Tom. 2. Jen. Germ. p. 69.</note> one; and because Saint <hi>Paul</hi> would not endure to have it done by his own person, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>Against this humour of men also.</hi> Luther <hi>said.</hi> How should it come to passe, that I a sack of wormes meat should be accessary to this,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59553:79"/>
that the children of Christ should be called after my base and unworthy name. He also much opposed the title of Lutherans, because we be all Christians, and professe the doctrin of Christ: as also because the Papists are guiltie of this crime, by calling themselves Pontificians. We <note place="margin">

The name of <hi>Luther</hi> is so o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to some, that they detest the hearing it: on the contrary other endure not that any thing should be found fault with, which either he speak or did: &amp; if any man dare speake against him, they declaime against him presently, as one guilty of impiety. They who thus extoll the name and authority of <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> as not doubting to ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate him above the condition and measure of Mortall men, should see to it, that they doe not wrong the good name of so excellent and admirable a man by attribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:59553:80"/>
too much to him: and that they doe not seeme to shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and protect their audaciousnesse, under his excellency. And those calumniators, who not onely condemne all his writings as ungodly and turbulent, now also, if they had any wit, might remember and consider, what is gotten by bitter envie, contumacy, froward opposition and outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious clamours.</p>
