            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

without a Patron, or recommitting it in an Apologie: To gild a dunghill would but exhale a stench; though the odours of Virtues charioted in Sun-beams, may communicate their influences, and perfume the world. Nor wants Poetry her Virtues; Stones, Trees, and wilde Beasts, accompany an <hi>Orpheus,</hi> while he mollifies the most obdurate, and stone-assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milating tempers; teaches the most irregular pieces by his measures, to be squared by the rule of proportion, and serve to the edifice of Virtue; produces harmony out of Natures discords, while the most savage natures by his harmony, are reduc'd to consort: Civility dead, Poesie revives: and though some object as the <hi>Lyrick</hi> to <hi>Maro, Quid si Threicio blandius Orpheo, auditam moderere arboribus fidem, non vanae redeat san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis Imagini;</hi> Virtue now being onely a vain and bloodless Image. Yet the love of this <hi>Euridice</hi> stung by the old Serpent, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches me a descent into this home-bred hell we carry within us; where foul tormenting pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions reside like furies; Lust is tied unto a wheel, Care and Envy, Vultur-like, feed on the Heart and Liver, while Incontinence
<pb facs="tcp:56395:3"/>
pours water into Sieves; Ambition rowls stones up Mountains, and the dropsie of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice, <hi>Tantalus-</hi> like, is thirsty in full Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. And though with <hi>Orpheus</hi> I cannot hope to unlearn Furies their cruelty, and teach their eyes in teares to wear the Livery of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; or reduce the belov'd <hi>Euridice:</hi> yet if I can ease any of their pains, by the delivery, my Charity-will be brought to bed of her children, which I shall desire your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour a Witness to. Nor is Poesie unworthy of your Patronage, which a Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi> hath prais'd, our Seraphick <hi>Donne</hi> us'd, the learned <hi>Scaliger,</hi> and he who makes all prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses modest, the excellent <hi>Hugo Grotius</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd in. Nay, ev'n the Prophets were Poets, and Pagan Poets are cited by the Apostles. And though Poesie be <hi>vinum daemonum,</hi> as the Father calls it, when it inebriates mens mindes with folly; yet it is <hi>flagellum daemonum</hi> when it las<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Let an Atheist, like <hi>Porphyrius,</hi> scoff at it, as borrowed from Gentilism; and an Apostate, resembling <hi>Julian,</hi> prohibite hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane literature in Christians, which none have disrespected, beside those whose ignorance render'd incapable of it, or blacker impieties court Oblivion. This could make an <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> descend to the <hi>Lyricks</hi> friendship; and a Lord <hi>Brook,</hi> as the most permanent Epitaph, desire to be writ Sir <hi>Philip Sidneys</hi> friend. Friends to Poesie cannot want a memory, while Time can keep a Register. <hi>Dignum laude virum musa vetat mori; &amp; ego te meis chartis carpere lividam opinionem tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que tuos patiar labores?</hi> Whether your ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomicall inspections to know your self both within and without, which intitle you to that some have call'd the Physician, a wise man; or unridling Aenigmaticall Law quirks? not onely by using your fortunes with reason injoy them, but know the reason how you injoy; or

whether you unravel Nature to her first Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and become of the Cabinet Councell to the Worlds Monarch, which styles you what others are miscall'd, The most Honourable, who in the worst of times dare be good; and when Ignorance is an Epidemicall disease, pass un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted; make to use of your Eminency to become a State Weather-cock, and turn round with every wind; or resemble those <hi>Magnifico's,</hi> who Comet-like sprung from fat and slime of earth, blaze and become portentous to Kingdoms; while Ignorance is blazon'd with Power, and Ambition and Avarice dress'd out with formalities of State: like Anticks in great houses carv'd with Honours, and gilded with Titles, may attract admiration from vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar heads: Yet wiser men can make no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter use of then the Cynick of his statues, onely to exercise patience. But to you, (who have pass'd through the Temple of Virtue to that of Honour, whose Honour is a Temple to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shrine Virtue, monopolizing more then these want, whose glorious outsides, like Egyptian Temples, by introspection afford nothing above an Ape.) As a tribute due to honour, I present these besprinklings of a retirement, while <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocritus-</hi>like

I laugh at the shittlecock world, and exquire the causes of the spleen in the beast, the Rabble; which will invite some who <hi>Abderitanae pectora plebis habent,</hi> the mad Rabble, and those Plebeian heads, who are a degree above them in their Clothes, not in their intelligences, to accuse me of phrensie: Yet an <hi>Hippocrates</hi> (the more refin'd spirit) will pass intainted with the aire of popular displicencies, since the Temples of Virtue and honour want not their sacrifices.</p>

                  <l>The gold that reall in her virtues were.</l>
