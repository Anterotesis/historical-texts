         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN the end of the primitive times, when the Apostles had finished their Testimony committed unto them, &amp; had gathered many out of the world, and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted many unto God, and many were established in the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, (which purifieth the heart and giveth victory over the world,) and were led to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, before the world was made, and the Churches which were in God, which had received the anointing, by which they knew all things, even the invisible things of God, and the mysteries of his glorious Kingdom, which God through the Spirit did reveal unto them; which Spirit they had received, being begotten of God, by which spirit they called him father, and by which Spirit of truth which was manifest from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>od aright, to obey and glorifie him, and his name which brought salvation unto them; and into this Spirit they were all baptised by the one Spirit into one body, and in this one Spirit they met and worshiped God, and were of one heart and of one mind, and did know their Director near them, and in them, and the time did come when they worshipped neither at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> nor at <hi>Samaria,</hi> but in the Spirit, and in the truth, wherein the Father was glorified, and came to see that fulfilled which the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rophets bore witness of, even him in whom all the Prophets ends in; Christ made manifest in them the hope of glory, whose voyce they heard from Heaven, by which they were quickned &amp; raised from death to life, by the effectual working of the mighty power of God, which wrought in them that did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and they were in the unity of the Faith, by which all their hearts were purified who held it, which is a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery held in a pure Conscience, by which they received

an assurance, and were made partakers of the promises, and became Inheritors of life and light, and immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and heirs of the promise, and Joynt-heirs with Christ, and they sate together with him in heavenly places, and eat with him, and drank with him in the Kingdom of God, which stood in power and in righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, joy, and peace, and did not look like the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> loe here, or there, but first felt it (as a grain of Mustardseed) in themselves, or as a corn of wheat which afterwards springs up as a blade, or as an ear of wheat to ripeness, to a full corn, and they did walk from Faith to Faith, from strength to strength, and did appear before God in <hi>Sion,</hi> and the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And now was the woman cloathed with the Sun, who had the Crown of twelve stars upon her head, and the Moon under her feet, who stood in that which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable and immutable, and now was the Man-child brought forth which was to rule the Nations, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to the Church which was in God, and he was the head by which all the members of the body was united to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one, and reconciled to the Father in one, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100859:3"/>
by his Obedience, Justification did come upon all that did believe.</p>
            <p>But since the woman fled into the wilderness, and the Man-child was caught up unto God, the mid-night of Darkness came upon the whole world, and the sincerity was lost, and the image of God lost, the Heir caught up out of the worlds sight Faith was lost, Hope lost, the Spirit lost, (the Saints rule and direction) And then the whore appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and made all Nations drunk with the wine of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, and they staggered and reeled to and fro, hither and thither, having lost the Spirit, became all waters, and unstable, and all the world wondered after the Beast, which then arose after the primative times, and after the Apostles daies, and admired him, and worsh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And then the whore made Decrees, who was gone from the Law-giver, and she made confessions of faith, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of faith, being out of the power of God, who is the Author of true faith, being guided by the power of the Dragon, she made orders of worship, and gave directions for worship, having gotten on the free womans attire, the outside, the Scriptures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the form of Godliness, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards became more abominable, having both lost the power and the form, worshipped the Devils power, and the Dragons power, and came forth in the image of him, and reached out the cup of fornication, and made the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons drunk with her Inchantments and sorceries, and she drunk the blood of the Martyrs, the blood of the Prophets, and them that kept the testimony of Jesus, the spirit of Prophecy, and then prescribed forms of worship, forms of prayer, and made creeds and faiths, and articles of faith, and many faiths; having lost the order of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, she made many orders, and sent out many Merchants to carry abroad her traffique and her merchandize to the Nations, and whole ships were filled full of it, vessels full of it, which went upon the Sea, and road upon the waters, upon Kindreds, Tongues, Nations, and Peoples, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100859:4"/>
of her merchandize, and bought of several sorts of merchandize which the several Merchants traded with, who had several orders prescribed then, (as Popes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, Jesuites, Fryers of many orders, and Monks of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny orders, Jesuites of many orders, and all these carryed their several wares &amp; traffique, and many more Tradesmen, many more merchants whom she sent out with her mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, who have been made rich by her merchandize, and other merchants were Bishops, Arch-bishops, Deacons, Arch-Deacons, Pryors, and Covents, Vicars, Comissaries, Chapters, Chancellors, Vice-Chancellors, Doctors of Divinity, Batchellors of Divinity, Doctors of Art, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Art, Batchellors of Art, Priests and Curats) by which they were made rich, and abounded in Treasure.</p>
            <p>And the Beast whom all the world wondred after, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled all to worship him, both small and great, upon which the whore rides, the scarlet-coloured Beast which hath guarded all her Merchants, and made all Nations buy their ware, and hath compelled all People to buy the whores Sorceries, even all the invented and heathenish trumperies which the whore hath patched up; and their Merchants painted over, which they have patched up, some from the Jews, some from the Heathen, some from the Saints words mixt with their own imaginations, and deceit, and has holden forth these as the publick worship in the Nations, and Kindreds, Tongues, and Peoples, their many Creeds, many Confessions of the Faith, many Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techismes, and many forms of worship; and when the people is weary of one sort of Merchandize, then brings another in more deceitfull and worse, and the Beast hath compelled the Nations to buy it, and to hold it as the publick profession of the Nations, though never so unsound and rotten, though damnable doctrines, and doctrines of Devils, though invented, and heretical opinions, invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed since the Apostles dayes; yet cryes the Beast, the Church hath ordained it, and the antient Fathers has agreed upon it, and the Councels has confirm'd it, and the Devines has
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100859:4"/>
ratified it, and the Bishops, and Arch-bishops, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Fathers has confirmed it, and recommended it for Orthodox and Authentick.</p>
            <p>And therefore sayes the beast upon which the whore rides, (the false Church) the mother of Harlots, if you will not agree to it, you are Hereticks, for the Church has power to censure you, to excommunicate you, and to curse you, and to deliver you up to Satan; and then the beast having made Laws for the sale of the whores Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and for the guarding of her Merchants, and their ships, if you consent not to the Articles of the Faith, and Confessions, you break the Law of the Nations, and are not subject to Authority; and now you are not puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed for Religion sake, nor for Christs sake, nor the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spels sake, but as evill-doers, and Transgressors of the Laws of our Kingdom or Nation: and thus the mother of Harlots which got up since the Apostacy, who hath drunk the blood of the Saints, and shed the blood of the Martyrs, and slain the witnesses, and hath put to many cruel deaths, She saith, I am clear, we kill none for Conscience sake, we persecute none for the Gospels sake, nor Christs sake, nor for Religions sake; but you suffer as Hereticks, and you have transgressed the law of Kings, Emperors, Councels, and Parliaments, and are enemies to States and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Rule, in breaking their wholsom Laws cryes the Harlot, who hath lost the savour; and her Merchants, which calls that which stinks and is corrupt, wholsome, and so saith the beast, we persecute you not for Religion, neither in persons, liberties, or estates, but the Church hath recommended this Doctrine, these Articles of Faith, these Creeds and Pater-nosters, this publick worship, or that Masse-book, or that Common Prayer-book, or this Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, and are not they the fittest to judge of Religion, who hath the Tongues, and the Original? and is fittest to give meanings and interpretations of the Scripture?</p>
            <p>And therefore we make a Law, that the Masse-book shall be holden out for the publick profession of these Nations, as the Pope, Cardinals, Jesuits, and Fryers think fit, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100859:5"/>
that the Common Prayer-book be holden forth as the publick worship, which the Bishops, Arch-bishops, Deacons, Arch-Deacons hath recommended unto us, as that which is consonant and agreeable to the primitive times, and to the Church which hath been established so many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, and whosoever will not consent and perform all the Rites and ceremonies, let him be indicted, and let him be presented, and let him be cited to appear before a Bishop, and let him imprison him, and fine him, and take away some of his Estate, and excommunicate him, and then its fit that the Secular power take notice of him for transgre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

a Queen upon Nations, Kindreds, Tongues and Peoples, till after the woman did fly away upon the wings of an Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle into the wildernesse for a time, times and half a time, and likewise they found out that our predecessors and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-merchants were not like the Ministers of Christ in the primitive times, neither our Doctrines and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, like the Ordinances and Doctrines which were once delivered to the Saints, before ever wee mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants set sail or floated in a ship on the Sea; And so finding our City to be raised up in its glory, since the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God was lost in the earth, and finding our Queen, mystery Babylon, ruling in our City since the Lambs wife fled, and finding us merchants to receive her traffique from her City since the faith was lost that once was delivered to the Saints, and did see our Creeds and Beliefs and Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosters, our prayers, and our hymns, that they are quite another thing, which was part of her traffique, they have concluded (and that upon infallible grounds) warranted by a cloud of witnesses in the Prophets and Apostles, that our mother is a whore, and her predecessors are her mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and that our Ordinances are and traffique have been invented by some of our mothers children which are Apostates, and they have found us out; And now alas! a ship will bee hardly able to ride any more upon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, nor the Sea will hardly bear up our vessels any more, the Nations, the kindreds, the tongues, and the peoples are almost dried up, especially in the North Regions they will not buy our Merchandize any more, our ships are like to stand still, and our Merchandize is like to be all shipwrackt; therefore let us take Councel, least all the Sea dry up, and we all sit down in solitarinesse, and our song be turned into woe worth the day, misery, and alas.</p>
            <p>Therefore now it behoves us all, reverend Brethren, who are of this last edition (tything Presbyters) to deny our Mother in her greatest fornication, and adultery, since she hath committed fornication with Kings and Nobles, and since all Nations have drunk of her cup: But yet let us own her three or four hundred years after the ascenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ, for then though she was inclining to Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,

and it lodged in her heart, yet it was not so openly known then, but only to a few, and then she held part of the form of Godliness, and had part of the true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches attire and ornaments on the outside, and so let us all agree to stick close to her hear, and vindi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Notwithstanding though the day be dawned, &amp; every mans works made manifest of what sort it is, yet it is well enough that we receive the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance which our mother Mystery Babylon gave unto our former merchants, as Tythes, Oblations, Obven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Offerings, Easter-reckonings, and Midsummer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dues, and Mortuaries, twenty shillings for a funeral Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, ten groats at the Grave, twelve pence an hour for ringing of bells, and such other like commodities that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls us; and besides all this we have got something out of Bishops lands, and Deans, and Chapters, and Prebends lands, some good augmentations out of these; so that all the merchandizing and traffique lyes in our hand, and all the wages that our mother gave to other Officers, and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors of several orders, which to speak plainly is the very reins and finews of our Gospel which we preach, and therefore if we cannot keep the people blind, but they will see our error in most things; yet while we have the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Earth to make us a Law, that all may be forced and compelled to pay that unto us, which our mother the Church gave us, when she was in her exaltation, while this is kept up, we shall cary about our ships, and merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Yet now, reverend brethren, seeing we cannot keep the People in ignorance and darkness, nor hinder the day

from dawning, nor the Sun from rising, while it is but even yet twylight, let us work and carry about our traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique, for the best sort of merchandize which our mother hath, will hardly please now, for now it comes to that, that nothing but spiritual Ordinances will be accepted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong people now, therefore we, which are of the tything Presbyterian order, though we have denyed our mother in some of her sorceries, and though we have denyed the Bishops, our Fathers, and ordinances, and their esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished form of worship, we being heirs apparent to their Inheritance, and Revenues, and wages; now we being come to maturity, and goes under the name of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, yet let our mother Mystery Babylons wages stand unalterable as the Law of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> and though the professions of publick worship have been deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and abolished, let us perswade the Magistrates, and Rulers, that if they abolish our tythes, and set wages, then the Gospel will cease to flourish in these Nations, and though the Mass-book, or book of Common-prayer, and the Lateny will not go off for Gospel and longer, we shall set something else up in its stead to be called the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, and because we have not an immediate Spirit, nor an infallable, neither ever looks to have it; its requisite that we prescribe some form or Directory of worship to be as a rule of Direction to all of our order, and if we can get a Parliament to make an ordinance for the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of it to the Nations, as the publick worship of God, then we may trade yet with out merchandize, and whilst our set wages is not altered, the matter is of less moment; and though the Directory should be discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, as it is recommended, and our form should go down, and another thing should be established instead of it; yet it were lawfull for us to joyn to another, and though they should accuse us for time-servers, and men-pleasers, yet we have a cloud of witnesses, as in <hi>Edward</hi> the 6. and <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. how many hundred of our Fellow-merchants denyed driving a trade with the Mass-book, and likewise in the daies of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> many thousands owned the

Mass-book as the publique worship of God, which was then holden out. Again, how many thousands of our Fellow-merchants denyed the Mass-book, our publick profession, doctrine and discipline, and joyned to the book of Common-Prayer, and the Lateny, as the publique profession of the worship of God, and now of late years we have denyed it our selves, and so we which are of this order can dispence well enough with this, seeing that we trade with som of our mothers? Merchandize under another name, and so the matter is less grievous, because the orders and ceremonies about worship is retained still in our Directo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry under another habit and guise, and so having these Witnesses before mentioned for our example, and if any seem to contend with us, this will take the edge off People, seeing its no new thing with us to set our sayles which way soever the wind blows, and it may be we may bring them a Scripture or two, and an inference from it, for a Cloak, as to submit to every ordinance of man for the Lords sake, and let every Soul be subject to the higher Power, so <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the 8th. while he stood he was the higher Power and so <hi>Mary, Elizab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But there is one thing above all which ought to be considered of by us, who are allowed to be publick Merchants, seeing that we must go under the name of Reformation, for that is our flag we carry in our Ship, that seeing that generally people of the most understanding will not allow of any preaching to be effectual, to the converting of Souls, but that which is ministred by or from the Spirit, for the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of old homilies which served in our Predecessors dayes will not serve now, or if we should speak some Hebrew or Greek, or Latin in an unknown Tongue, they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that is rather the wisdom of the flesh, &amp; from natural
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100859:12"/>
wit, rather then from the Spirit; and therefore it is not much amiss if we conclude to let some of the Ancient Fathers pass, and not mention them, because it is holden generally, that they lived in an Apostatizing time, and so it will not be effectual in the audience of people: And so for <hi>Austin</hi> and <hi>Cyprin, Jerom</hi> and <hi>

and sinews of the Propagation of our Gospel.</p>
            <p>And now Reader, I shall give thee an account of the principal and chief traffique, which is established for the Publike Worship amongst those that are called Gospel-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors, the general heads whereof is laid down in a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory</hi> of the Publike Worship in these three Nations of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi>; and the general heads of that which they purpose to traffique with, is laid down in their <hi>Directory</hi> (so called) and what traffique is of less mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may be ushered in, time will make manifest, and in their Preface to their Book, they say as follows.</p>
            <p>Directory. <hi>That the Liturgy hath been a great means to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease an idle Ministery from putting forth themselves, for putting forth the gift of prayer which Christ pleaseth to furnish all his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants with, whom he calls to that Office.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> So then by this conclusion all their former Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and fellow-Merchants were not sent out by Christ, because they contented themselves with set forms of others made to their hands; and if all whom Christ called to this Office be furnisht with the gift of prayer, then this must needs follow, that they that have no gift of prayer, are no officers of Christ: Well, their part being acted, and the <hi>Exit</hi> being come, let them go off the Stage, and thou shalt see the gifted men come on next.</p>

And furthermore, thou may take notice, that the Spirit of the Lord is turned out of doors, there is no place for it; outward water with which the Infant is sprinkled, hath taken up the authority, and the work of the Spirit, the Ministers of Christ declared, that the Spirit of Promise, and the Spirit of Truth, was the Seal of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, and remission of sins, Regeneration, and

Adoption; and that the Faith, and the Spirit, is the Seals of Eternal Life: But these Reformers hath excluded both, and have set up a beggerly Element in the room; let the spiritual man judge what kind of traffique this is.</p>

Furthermore, Bread and Wine was a Seal of Eternal Life, before, you said, and now ease, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment, and strength is promised to the weak: I say as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle said to them who discerned not the Lords Body, but came unworthily, <hi>For this cause many are weak, and many are sick, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are fallen asleep</hi>; and though they have come to your Table, they have come sick and weakly, and have gone away so, and hath found your promises and assurances of no effect at all.</p>

            <p>If you intend the first day of the week, where is that called the Christian Sabbath? the Sabbath, in the first Covenant was given for a sign of the Christian Sabbath, which was to be revealed when they ceased from their own works, words, &amp; thoughts, then the rest was to be known, the Christian Sabath; and whether is a Christian Sabbath a visible or invisible thing? But stay Sirs, do you keep this day (which you call a Christians Sabbath) holy to the Lord? is not this your Market day upon which you sell your Traffique, one or two Glasses for 20 or 30 s. a day, besides what you get for sprinkling of Infants? do you not speak your own words, nor think your own thoughts, nor work your own works? If you say you do not, how comes it to pass, that there are all these defects in your performances, &amp; all this iniquity in your holy things?

               <hi>Answ.</hi> If you mean by Sacrament a holy thing, then mariage is either holy or unholy, if unholy, then fit to be done by none; if holy, why is it not proper and peculiar to the Church of God? if they who are Members of the Church of God may marry (in the Lord, &amp; in the covenant in which man was made) the male and the female,; then what hath any to do with it, who are not of the Church of God? and what hath the Church of God to do with them that are without? and what hath a Priest to do with this? where was <hi>Abrahams</hi> and <hi>Sarahs</hi> Priest when they were maried? and where was the Priest to solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize the mariage of <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Rebeccah</hi>? and of <hi>Sachariah</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi>? and because you say its not peculiar to the Church of God, whether were these of the Church of God before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? but what hath the Priest to do to publish it three times like a Belman for the loss of a Horse or Cow thorow the Market? or rather why ought not the man and the woman both in the fear of the Lord (if they be moved thereunto by the Lord) pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish their own intentions; And moreover, their joyning toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Church of God, when the members of the Church of God are present; but this frustrateth the Priests 5 or 10 s and his Clerk 6 d. or a shilling more or less as they can get.</p>
            <p>Direct. <hi>Furthermore, they say it may be done any time of the year, but on a Fasting-day, or on the Lords day.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Why are these days prohibited? if mariage be a holy thing, or an honorable thing, why may it not be done in the fear of God, and the power of God, why not on any day? was days made for man, or man made for days? your ignorant Predecessors, the Pharisees judged as you do, that it was not expedient or conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, that he should heal a Daughter of <hi>Abraham</hi> whom Satan had bound on the Sabbath day; And now they say, that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Estate of Mariages, is the Covenant of their God; and before they said, it was not peculiar to the Church of God; if en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into a state of Mariage be the Covenant of God, and if the Covenant of God be peculiar to the Church of God, then what is the reason (you Reformers) that Mariage is not peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar to the Church of God? And now take their directions (who

What was not this man baptized when he was an infant; and have not you said, and in the 48 page and 45 page of your <hi>Directory,</hi> that Water-baptism is a Seal of the Covenant of Grace, and of being ingrafted into Christ, and of Regeneration, Adoption, and Eternal Life; and what is the Evidence and Seal lost now? Useth not this to be the doctrine amongst you, once in Christ, and ever in Christ, and whom he loves once, he loves to the end? and hath not this man partaken of the Sacrament, and eat the flesh of Christ, and drank his blood, and a Church-member?

               <hi>Answ.</hi> To fast unto the Lord, is not to set a day apart by the will of man, but by being moved thereunto by the Lord, and not to hang down the head for a day like a Bull-rush, nor to smite with the fists of wickedness, but to loose the band of wickedness, and let the oppressed go free: And as for gorgious attire, and rich apparrel, and ornaments, its no where found so much as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you (Steeple-house) Fasters; and for delights, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and these things, which you say is lawful at other times, that which so judgeth will not forsake them in your set times; and if they be lawful at any time, then the Apostles exhortation is made void, who said, <hi>Not in gold, nor costly array, nor broidered hair</hi>; that which abstains from them one day, and takes them up ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day, is hypocrisie and deceit: And as for your abstinence from one set meal in a day, and it may be go to a banquet, or a riot, the next day after, this is abomination to the Lord.

            <p>Direct. <hi>But to proceed, such Texts ought to be used for preaching, that may best work the hearts of the hearers into humiliation, and repentance, and the Minister is to exhort before they depart, that their Assembly may improve their whole life to the glory of God, by re-inforcing themselves and their families in all private resolutions towards God, which they professed in publike.</hi>

            <p>Dir. <hi>And now I come to the singing Psalms, and their Mass-house, the place of their Worship, and so I have done with their traffique. First, they say, that singing of Psalms publikely in a Congregation, with a tuneable voice, is a Christians duty.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>An</hi> Where was it injoyned by Christ, or any of his Ministers? I am ignorant, and yet the Scripture I know, but no where read in it, that singing of Prophefies, and Prayers, and other mens conditions, turned into Rime and Meeter by Poets, and Masters of Musick, in an invented tune (in the same mind which invents tunes for Ballet-mongers) and to sing such conditions amongst proud, wanton, and disdainful people, covetous, envious, and such as hath not so much as endeavoured after mortification, or newness of life (as generally your Parochial Congregations are) as you have confest in your <hi>Directory</hi> for Publike Worship; this is no way accounted as a Christian duty, for whose souls are not brought out of death, cannot praise the Lord; and you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess Ministers and Congregation, that you are blind in mind, and hard in heart, and full of unbelief, impenitency, luke-warmness, and barrenness, not endeavouring to receive Christ into your hearts, your state is howling and lamentation, and not rejoycing, yet singing with the Spirit is owned, and with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</p>
            <p>Dir. <hi>And now we come to the place of publike Worship: They say it is not unlawful or unconvenient for Christians to meet together in the place which was dedicated to Idolatry, or consecrated to an idolatrous use, yet we hold it requisite, that the places of publike Worship should be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and continued to that use.</hi>

Did <hi>Josiah</hi> or <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> when they had broken down the Altars of <hi>Baal,</hi> and thrown down the high places, did they say, its requisite and convenient, that our

Priests, and the Levites, &amp; the Congregation, do meet at the Altar of <hi>Baal,</hi> or at the high places? Or did the Apostles bid the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> who did believe, go to their Idols Temple again, and say it was a convenient place to worship the true God in? And have you forgotten that exhortation or precept, Abstain from every appearance of evil? And though some do know that an Idol is nothing in the world, howbeit there is not in every man that knowledg; and is it not yet called by most of you yet, The House of God, House of Prayer? But as you did begin, so will you end to carry no traffique but for your mother, mystery <hi>Babylon.</hi>

            <p>And thus, Reader, I have led thee through many things, from the rise of the Whore, and through the most of her merchants, and through the most of her traffique merchants, of divers or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and ranks; but I find them all to trade with nothing but Inchantments and Sorceries, which hath long bewitched the Nations; but the time is come, that she is manifest, with her merchandize and Sorceries, and turned from, by me and many thousands more, which is my exhortation to thee, that so thou may come to the Church which is in God, and to the elect as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, and to know the seed which is heir of the promise, and of the Life which is without end: Which mystery Babylon, with all her merchants have sought to destroy, since she got up to ride upon the Beast, who hath compelled all both small and great to worship him, and also all Nations to buy the Whores merchandize and traffique, which hath deceived the Nations, and bewitched them; but the time is come, that she shall be hated of her Lovers, and they shall forsake her; and her merchants shall say, Alas! alas! which day is dawning and dawned, which discovers the Whore the Beast and false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, with all their sorceries, and the Lamb shall reign, and the holy men of God, and Prophets shall rejoyce over her, when the smoak of her torment ascends up for ever and ever; which the Lord hasten saith my Spirit, <hi>Amen.</hi>
