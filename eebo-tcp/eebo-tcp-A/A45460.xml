            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

By this you may perceive much of his diſcourſe—to be not onely
ſuperfluous and unneceſſary, but alſo contrary to himſelfe, for
he laboureth to perſwade that the Proteſtant may be certaine of
ſome truth, againſt which the Roman Catholick Church bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to profeſſion of error, which is as much as to ſay, as he who
pretendeth to have no infallible rule by which to governe his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
ſhall be ſuppoſed to be infallible, and he that pretendeth
to have an infallible rule, ſhall be ſuppoſed to be fallible; at
moſt becauſe fallible objections are brought againſt him: now
then conſider what a meek and humble Son of the Church ought
to doe, when of the one ſide is the Authority of Antiquity
and Poſſeſſion (ſuch Antiquity and Poſſeſſion without diſpute
or contradictions from the adverſary, as no King can ſhew for
his Crowne, and much leſſe any other perſon or perſons for any
other thing) the perſwaſion of infallibility, all the pledges that
Chriſt hath left to his Church for Motives of Vnion: on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide, uncertaine reaſons of a few men pretending to learning,
every day contradicted by incomparable numbers of men Wiſe
and Learned, and thoſe few men confeſſing thoſe reaſon and
themſelves uncertaine, fallible, and ſubject to error, certainly
without a bias of intereſt or prejudice, it is impoſſible for him to
leave the Church if he be in it, or not returne if he be out of it: for
if infallibility be the ground of the Churches power to command
beliefe, as ſhee pretends no other, no time, no ſeparation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
memory of Hiſtory, can juſtifie a continuance out of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49478:8"/>
Church: You may pleaſe to conſider then how ſolid this Doctors
diſcourſe is, who telleth us, for his great evidence, that we, (ſaith
he) who doe not acknowledge the Church of Rome to be infallible,
may be allowed to make certaine ſuppoſitions (that follow there)
The queſtion is, whether a Proteſtant be a Schiſmatick becauſe
a Proteſtant? and he will prove he is not a Schiſmatick, becauſe
he goeth conſequently to Proteſtant, that is Schiſmatical grounds:
I pray you reflect, that not to acknowledge the Church to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
is that for which we charge the Doctor with Schiſme
and Hereſie</hi> in Capite, <hi>and more than for all the reſt he holds di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
from us, for this principle taketh away all beliefe, and
all ground of beliefe, and turneth it into uncertainty and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-cock
opinion, putteth us into the condition to be</hi> circumferri
omni vento Doctrinae, <hi>ſubmitteth us to Atheiſme and all ſort
of miſcreancy, let him not then over-leap the queſtion, but either
prove this is not ſufficient to make him a Schiſmatick and an
Heretick too, or let him acknowledge he is both.</hi>

                  <hi>where not to reflect upon his curious diviſion, I cannot omit that
he remembers not what matters he handles, when he thinketh the

in quiet poſſeſſion of ſuch a Primacie, the proof that it was juſt
belongeth not to us, more than to any King, who received his
Kingdome from his Anceſtors, time out of minde, to prove his
pretenſion to the Crown juſt: for quiet poſſeſſion of it ſelf is a
proof, untill the contrary be convinced, as who ſhould rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
ſuch a King were a Rebell, untill he ſhewed ſufficient cauſe
for quitting obedience; with this difference, that obedience to a
King may be preſcription or bargain be made unneceſſary, but if
Chriſt hath commanded obedience to his Church, no length of
years, nor change of humane affairs can ever quit us from this
duty of obedience, ſo that the charge of proving the Pope to have

anſwerable to that <hi>promiſe</hi> of the <hi>Keyes</hi> to <hi>Peter,
Mat.</hi> 16. as a <hi>ſpecial promiſe,</hi> and conſequently if there were
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:49478:37"/>
nothing in that <hi>promiſe</hi> peculiar to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> there was nothing
in that <hi>performance</hi> peculiar to him. And ſo neither he nor

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Num. </seg>2</label> But to come to ſome matter, His firſt arguments is that this
Iſland was converted before S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s time, ſurely he
means by the name of Iſland, the Land and Mountains and
trees, for if he ſpeak of the men, what hath the converſion of the

who have <hi>ſucceeded</hi> one another, whether <hi>Britiſh</hi> or <hi>Saxon</hi>

were not converted by <hi>miſſion</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> but were <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
long before S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s coming hither, And <hi>Secondly,</hi>
of the <hi>Saxons</hi> it may be remembred, that <hi>Augustine</hi> did not
<hi>abſolutely</hi> introduce <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> among them here, but
<hi>Luidhardus,</hi> that came out of <hi>France</hi> with <hi>Bertha, Ethelred</hi>'s

if <hi>Auguſtine</hi> were the firſt <hi>converter</hi> of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and ſo
that be, without farther <hi>queſtion,</hi> granted of him, yet that
cannot belong to the whole <hi>Iſland,</hi> the <hi>Dominion</hi> of <hi>Wales</hi>
being neither of <hi>Saxon</hi> extraction, nor converted from
<hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> And this is the deſigne of that argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

from whence the converter came, and in caſe that were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:49478:53"/>

were falſly determined by the King and Biſhops, then the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
and free doing it will not juſtifie, and if it were not, then
was there truth in it, antecedent to, and abſtracted from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination,
and it was their duty ſo to determine, and crime
that they were unwilling: laying the whole weight of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon this, that the pretenſions for the Popes ſupremacy in
<hi>England</hi> muſt be founded either as ſucceſſor to S. <hi>Peter</hi> in the

To which I anſwer, that we relie on the firſt as the foundation
and corner-ſtone of the whole building, On the ſecond as an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
worthy the ſucceſſor of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> which requires a gratefull
conſideration from us; And on the third not as a conceſſion, but
as a juſt acknowlengment of what was neceſſary for the good of
Chriſtian Religion, taught our Kings by thoſe who taught them
Chriſtian Religion; of which belief, I mean that the Pope as
Succeſſor to S. <hi>Peter</hi> is head and governour of the Vniverſal
Church, we have been in poſſeſſion ever ſince the converſion of our
Engliſh Anceſtors, then Saxons, to the Chriſtian religion, made
by <hi>Auſtin</hi> the Monk ſent hither by Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
untill that good King <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. out of ſcrupuloſity
of conſcience (no noubt) was pleaſed to cut the Gordian knot of
thoſe bonds, within which all his Anceſtors limited themſelves;
neither ſhall all that the Doctor and his fellows have ſaid, or can
ſay, justifie themſelves ſo, but that ſuch a poſſeſſion, as I here

confeſſe it is a humility I underſtand not, firſt to profeſſe, they
know not whether their teachers ſay true or no (that is, that
they are fallible) and then to hold under pain of damnation what
they ſay. Another piece of their humility is in ſubmitting to
ages, where very few witneſſes can be found, in regard of the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Authors and the little occaſion they had to ſpeak of
preſent controverſies. A third note of humility is, that whereas
the fourth Councel was held about the midſt of the fift Age,
theſe lovers of truth will ſtand to it, but not to the fourth Age
precedent, or that very Age in which it was held, ſo humble they
are to ſubmit to any authority, that toucheth not the queſtions in

perſons confeſſedly that ever was among them, to be a building
likely to laſt but 80 years, and to be now torn up by the roots,
and this done by the ſame means by which it was ſetled; I ſay
if this Catholick believe his eyes, he is at leaſt to be excuſed;
and though I know the Doctor will reply his Church is ſtill in
being, preſerved in Biſhops and Preſbyters rightly ordained,
yet let him remember how inconſequent this is, to what be hath
ſaid before, for ask him how it doth remain in being, if there
be no ſuch Biſhops or Preſbyters among them, for his defenſe
againſt the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is, that the ſecular authority hath
power to make and change Biſhops and Presbyters: from whence
it will follow, that as they were ſet up by a ſecular authority,
ſo are they pulled down, and unbiſhoped by another ſecular au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
if it be ſaid the Parliament that pulled them down
had not the three bodies requiſite to make a Parliament, no
more had that which ſet them up, for the Lords Spiritual were
wanting both in Parliament and Convocation, ſo that there
was as much authority to pull them down as to ſet them
up: but it will be replied that though they are pulled down,
yet are they ſtill Biſhops,</hi> viz: <hi>the character remains upon
them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alas what is their Character, if their miſſion of Preaching
and Teaching be extinguiſhed, which follows their juriſdiction,
which juriſdiction the Doctor makes ſubject to the ſecular au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
ſo that whatſoever characters their Biſhops and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
pretend to have, they have according to his principles no
power over the laity, and ſo no character can be made of any
Biſhop as head and Paſtor, and of the People as body and flock,
and conſequently their Church is gone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But we account our ſelves Biſhops and Prieſts not from an
authority dependent upon Princes, or inherited from</hi> Auguſtus <hi>or</hi>
Nero, <hi>but from</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> Paul, <hi>and ſo ſhall ſtand and continue,
whatſoever Princes or ſecular powers decree; when they accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their doctrines and arguments are not to wonder if they be
thrown down by the ſame authority that ſet them up, and as the
Synagogue was a Church to have an end, ſo is this with this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
that the Synagogue was a true Church in reference to a

this be not very immoderate liberty, which this

               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> that before they went to this Meeting, they were
adviſed by a <hi>religious</hi> perſon, whoſe directions they asked, to
obſerve diligently the <hi>behaviour</hi> of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> when they
came, whether he were <hi>meek</hi> and <hi>lowly in heart,</hi> a mark by

which they might know whether he had taken <hi>Chriſt's yoke</hi>

<hi>Chriſt,</hi> which he now deſired to impoſe upon them, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Auguſtine's</hi> fitting ſtill upon his ſtool or ſeat, and never

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> For the former, 1. the no great <hi>credit</hi> that hath been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the relations of <hi>Bede</hi> on this head of <hi>miracles</hi> (of
which his <hi>Story</hi> is ſo richly furniſhed) together with the great
