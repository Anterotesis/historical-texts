            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HOw vain are the thoughts of ſuch, who whilſt Youth and ſtrength accompany them, never conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they are a meer Statue of Duſt kneaded with Tears, and moved by the hid Engines of reſtleſs paſſions; a Clod of Earth, which the ſhorteſt Feaver can burn to aſhes, and the leaſt ſhower of Rheums waſh away to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; inſtead thereof they bounce ſo high, and make ſo great a noiſe in the World, as if both the Globes (thoſe glorious Twins) had been unwomb'd from the formleſs Chaos by the Midwifery of their brain. Such was my diſordered Fancy, and my actions being attended ſtill with ſucceſſes, anſwerable to my deſires, I thought my ſelf (notwithſtanding my vicious practices) one of Heavens Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorites, and by the eloquence of my own vanity, perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded my ſelf that the Machinations of my Brain were able to unhinge the Poles. But Heaven thought fit I ſhould no longer reign in pride and arrogance, and therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted me into hands of Juſtice, to be puniſht to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits of my Crimes. Being here confm'd in this Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtial Hell, ſurrounded with horror and deſpair, my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſtarted out of her dead ſleep, and demanded a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere account of what I had done; guilt inſtantly did ſtop my mouth, and having not a word to ſay for my ſelf, I withed my production (as my actions) inhumane; ſuch was
<pb facs="tcp:55449:3"/>my deplorable deſtruction, that I thought I heard the howls and hollow groans of damned Souls, which added weight to one anothers perpetual miſery; Whilſt I was in the greateſt Agony imaginable, a Miniſter, or rather a charitable Phyſitian for my ſin ſick Soul, came to viſit me, who knowing me a notorious Offender, adviſed me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, for as yet it was not too late; hereupon he propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeveral queſtions, endeavouring to disburden my over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loaded conſcience, by extracting from me an ingenious ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Confeſſion of what enormous Crimes I had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; finding this pious man had no other deſign then for the benefit of my Soul, and knowing withall, the impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of my eſcape, by reaſon of ſo many Indictments al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged againſt me; I plainly laid open the whole courſe of my Life, not omitting any circumſtance remarkable. Having put a period to my Narrative, he ſeemed all won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I perceived quickly that his amazement proceeded from the ſtrange Hiſtory of my wicked Life and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; this wonder was ſoon converted into pity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration, that a man ſo young ſhould be thus weeded out of the Garden of the World, juſt as he is entred into the blooming Spring time of his Age: After he had throughly made me ſenſible of the danger that attend theſe wicked courſes (applying his Corroſives before his Cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls) he then acquainted me with the benefit of true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; in ſhort, it will take me up too much time to give an account of every thing which was alledged either for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, contrition, or conſolation, delivering that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine meſſage with ſo much power and efficacy, that the obdurateneſs of my heart was able to hold out no longer, but melting into tears, I was willing to have its flintineſs broken by the Hammer of ſacred Scripture. Finding me
<pb facs="tcp:55449:3"/>in ſo good a temper, he left me to God and my ſelf, for the perfecting that great work he had ſo hopefully and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily begun. I now condemn'd a ſaying, which I once ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded, uſed much by ſome of my deſolute companions; <hi>he is more ſorrowful then is neceſſary, that is, ſorrowful before there is neceſsity:</hi> for had Sorrow taken place, where Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſate Regent, and juſtled out all conſideration of the dreadful effects that attend our evil facts, doubtleſs we ſhould not be made a ſhameful ſpectacle to mankind, and a heart-breaking to our deareſt Relations; that ſaying of <hi>Seneca,</hi> I wiſh I had practiced as well as regiſtred in my memory; <hi>When I was young, I ſtudied to live well; when aged, how to dye well.</hi> As I was in the midſt of theſe ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous contemplations, my heavenly Phyſitian came again to viſit me, to know and inquire into the condition and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament of my Soul, feeling in what manner did beat the Pulſe of its affection. Finding the conſtitution of my better part indifferent ſound, and that there was great hopes of a perfect recovery, he rendred thanks to the Almighty for his infinite mercy in looking down with pity on poor ſinful creatures, whom, when the Law hath caſt them off, and baniſht them from this lower world, out of his meer infinite goodneſs receives them into his own bleſſed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. To give this holy man ſome real teſtimony of my unfeined repentance, I ſhew'd him the abſtract of my Life, drawn up a little before my apprehenſion, and did intend to have publiſhed it, reſolving at that time to have abandon'd all thoſe deſtructive deſperate courſes which I formerly followed by Padding on the High-way, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution had I kept, my Country would have received the benefit without any further detriment to me either in Life or Reputation. Now, ſince I have no other means left
<pb facs="tcp:55449:4"/>to ſatisfie in part the injuries I have done my Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, let this enſuing Diſcovery not only extenuate my manifold offences, but more eſpecially be the medium of preventing the like hereafter: in the firſt place give me leave briefly to acquaint you with ſome remarks in the ſeries of my ſhort Life, and in the next place, let me lay down ſome notable inſtructions for your future caution, and preſervation againſt High-way-men, thoſe devouring &amp; deſtroying Caterpillars of a corrupt and polluted Nation. I ſay little of my Parents more then that they were too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent to me, ſupplying my youthful extravagancies with money continually, in ſuch ſuperfluity, that my invention was frequently puzzled to find out ways for quick diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch. Theſe unneceſſary expences took up ſo much time, that there was little leſt for my Study, ſo that I became as deficient in acquired learning, as my Parents grew indigent in their Eſtate by my profuſeneſs and debaucheries: whilſt with tears they lamented their poverty, occaſioned by their fooliſh indulgence, and deploring my future ſad condition, foreſeeing or fearing the diſmal cataſtrophe which inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly attends ſuch irregular pranks and wild practices. Death in pity came and cloſed their eyes, that they might not ſee what otherwiſe would break hearts. By the loſs of their breath, I found the want of their kindneſs, and having not that ſupply of money, the ſole compoſure of that Flambeau, which light me to all thoſe ſeveral extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies my diſorderly paſſions, my diſorderly will prompted me to go to, I then did caſt about what courſe to ſteer. My ſcandalous deportment made me an exile to civil ſociety, and the frequent diſobligations I threw on my neareſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, made me an abſolute ſtronger to their Families, whereby I was reduced to great extremity, ſo that neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb facs="tcp:55449:4"/>the Mother of ingenuity, was conſtrained to pump eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day for ſome new Stratagem to appeaſe a Stomack in an uproar for the want of ſuſtenance. Which wanting the accuſtomed pampering even to ſaciety, made me frequent the eating ſociety ſo long, till I had eaten quite through my credit, and devoured my cloaths to boot. My Breeches were ſo jag'd and tatter'd (that I may ſay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence to the Reader, though jocoſely) they looked ſomewhat like thoſe that are now call'd <hi>a la mode,</hi> and ſeem'd as if my Arſe, according to the Proverb, was hung with Points: my Hat broad brim'd, broader than the broadeſt once in faſhion, in pure love and kindneſs would have flapt ore my ſhoulders, to have hid the ſhame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion my face was in, that my own eyes (as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) ſhould ſee my Coat becullendred, or like a Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boat, and though it had as many holes, or more than <hi>Argos</hi> had eyes, yet wanted one to find out ſome pitiful Soul that would intend relief to a wretch ſo miſerable. Had not this misfortune befell me, I ſhould have thought it a thing impoſſible for a man to live ſo well, and ſo ill, in that ſhort Regiſtry of time. But now when nothing but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair attended me, being altogether unfit for humane ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and ſo out of conceit with my ſelf, that I thought my ſelf unworthy of a forreign Plantation, and therefore to that end would not apply my ſelf to ſome Merchant; nay I could not think Hells Imp, a Kidnapper, would take of me any cognizance; as I walked very early (for the hardneſs of my lodging would not ſuffer me to lye long, and modeſty would not permit to be ſeen lying on or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Stall, unleſs the Sun had been up to have warm'd my chilly limbs, benumb'd by committing inceſt with my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Earth. I ſay, being thus early up, I timely met with
<pb facs="tcp:55449:5"/>a long Purſe lying neglected in the Street, whoſe entrance was on the middle like a Wallat; and diving into the bowels thereof, I found at one end ſome yellow dirt or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement, and the other white, at the ſight whereof my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was ſeiz'd with a general convulſion, ſo that I fear'd each member would become a Traytor to each other in the diſcovery of this prize to the right Owner, and by that means be deprived of that wanted benefit. I firſt conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my hands in the concealment of this Treaſure, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereunto it was conveyed into my Pocket-holes, but I forgetting my Pockets were bottomleſs, it dropt quite through, which I ſoon ſnatcht up, and then betaking my ſelf to my trembling legs, I got into the Fields with an inquiſitive eye and panting heart, and under an Hedge found in this Purſe ten pound in Silver, and fifty Guynies; burying all this money, but fifty ſhillings, in the Earth, I went and bought an ordinary Suit ready made, and this I did for fear of being ſuſpected how I came by the money, being indifferently accoutred, I removed my hidden Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, thinking it not ſafely truſted any where but about me. Now did I think I might confidently enough take a lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, remote from thoſe who knew me, and having furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my ſelf with a Chamber, I pretended to be a Country Gentlemans Son, who came up to <hi>London</hi> about a Suit in Law, and behav'd my ſelf accordingly, not diſcovering the leaſt ſymptom of any former debauchery, obſerving very early hours for bed-time; but not contented with that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, I was diſſatisfied till I was in another habit, more ſplendid, and that I might do it more boldly and ſafely, I fram'd a lye to my Landlord, that I had caſt and recovered a conſiderable ſum from one of my Fathers Creditors, and doubted not in a very little time to overthrow the reſt.
<pb facs="tcp:55449:5"/>This gain'd me a great reputation in the houſe, eſpecially ſeeing my money, and beſpeaking a gentile Suit of Clothes, with all neceſſary appurtenances befitting perſons of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as ſilver Sword, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I now ſcorn'd the thoughts of aſſociating my ſelf with thoſe narrow-ſoul'd-plebeian-Snippers, whoſe Parents being neither able or willing to ſee their Sons go in a garb out-ſhining commonalty in the time of their Apprenticeſhip, or if there be ability and propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity thereunto, or the moroſe Maſter hindring it, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct their Servants pride and vanity, yet are theſe Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens boundleſs deſires ſuch, that though to the ruine of themſelves, and the breaking of their Maſters) they will have theſe gawdy out-ſides to Pimp for their Leachery and other ſenſualities, having moneys in their Pockets (though none of their own) to pay for it. For their habiliments they purchaſe by exchange of their Maſters goods one with another, and the money they purloin out of the Box, or one of the Snipping Crew ſhall convert a Piece of Goods for him, into ready money, and go his ſhare. The Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer deals with the Draper, and a Taylor perhaps, who hath Ship-wrackt his conſcience, deals with them both; and the Linnen-Draper, Hoſier, Goldſmith, &amp;c. with ſuch like ornamental clothing Trades, are reſpected as very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial inſtruments among them, nay, they will ſtoop ſo low ſometimes to chaffer for Belly-Timber of the choicer ſort, and will bid fairly to a Drawer for a Flower. I might amply enlarge my diſcourſe concerning the Locuſts, as how they inſinuate into the Maids favour, to let them out at unſeaſonable hours, and ſtay up for them, till it be early, to the great prejudice of their Maſters Buſineſs the next day, and at length, the Wench will find for the reward of this notable place of night ſervice, a great Belly, and when
<pb facs="tcp:55449:6"/>ſhe expects to find relief from the Caterwowling Father, the Plot is diſcovered, and they both turn'd out of Doors, to their utter ruin and deſtruction. I ſhall deſiſt ſaying more on this ſubject, but only adviſe the Maſter to have a prudent and careful eye over his Servants, checking by times any looſneſs he diſcovers, ſo ſhall he find his buſineſs done, when requiſite, and they the benefit of their fidelity, by performing their truſt at the expiration of their time.</p>
            <p>Now to return where Heft off: being gallantly equipt, I ſoon got new acquaintance, the moſt of which were inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately acquainted with the humours of the Town, were incomparable at the Art of wheedling, which ſome call Complaiſance, neither were they unpractiſed in any ſort of Game, but more eſpecially Cards and Dice, both which pernicious Tools, they have labour'd with more, and taken as much pains to underſtand, as a ſeven years Student hath done with <hi>Ariſtotles Organon.</hi> One of theſe whom I judg'd had ſomewhat better principles then the reſt, I dayly accompanied, and grew in a little time, to be ſo familiar, that we emboſom'd the Arcana's of each others concern, without reſtriction or ſuſpition, and having tryed each others fidelity, we agreed upon a laſting league of Brother-hood, and knowing that contiguity of bodies is the ſpeedieſt confirmation of a deſired friendſhip, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to lye together.</p>
            <p>Now were our thoughts and actions like the Air to all, as free to one another, and although in love there ſhould be no competitor, yet ſuch hath our freedom been, that frequently the ſubject of our amours, hath been one and the ſame perſon, whom he firſt knew and loved (as he ſaid) beyond any of her Sex, and I wiſh he had ſtill loved her without me, then had not thoſe reſiſtleſs charms en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thron'd
<pb facs="tcp:55449:6"/>in every Feature of her Face, ſo bewitcht and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facinated my reaſon, that I undervalued the greateſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger for her ſake, nor did I ſcruple to undertake any thing for her ſatisfaction, as I ſhall hereafter declare more at large, for the Readers ſatisfaction, but to my great grief, ſhe being the cauſe of mine, as ſuch looſe ambitious wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are of thouſands of mens ruine and deſtruction.</p>
            <p>My new acquaintance finding me but raw and ill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced in the crafts of this ſubtle world, undertook to be my Tutor, and read his Lectures to me every day: what his mouth did not inform, his actions inſtructed me in. When I was abroad; I obſerved his deportment to a hair, and took wonderful delight in imitating his inſinuations, whereby I had rigled my ſelf into what Tavern-credit I pleaſed, without being great with the Vintner, though much in his Books, but by being inwardly acquainted with his Wife or ingratiating my ſelf into the favour of his Daughter, if Bar-keeper; for then I knew the moneys going all through her hands, ſhe might perform her part well enough in the Art of Conveyance, as well as the moſt experienc'd Scrivener about the Town, and with leſſer noiſe and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The Purchaſe of theſe favours, though at firſt they coſt a conſiderable ſum, yet I found by computation, the annual income recompenced the coſt.</p>
            <p>He made it his buſineſs to inquire out impotent men, who had buckſome luſty Wives, if Shop-keepers, he commonly bought commodities of them as an introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for his dealing in one not to be ſold, becauſe, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter keeps it for his own uſe, and ſo according to each ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Trade or Profeſſion, he ſquar'd his deſigns, ſo that frequently they took effect, unleſs the premiſes were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſt by a brother of the ſame Quill.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:55449:7"/>
            <p>The next thing he taught me, was to Game, and made me ſo great a proficient at it, that I could Nick the Nicker ſometimes, by which means I was taken for a Brother at the Ordinary, and, by frequently dining there, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing, and practiſing with the Rooks, I went my ſhare in a Bubbling, and had an intereſt in ſeveral Taverns near the Ordinary, where the poor Cully was inveigled in, and afterward under the pretence of great kindneſs, then wheedled into Play, and in a thrice the VVoodcock de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plum'd, and not a ſouſe left to give a Link-boy to light him home.</p>
            <p>In this ſort, I as greedily hunted after prey; as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil doth after Uſurers Souls on their Death-beds. Nor was the Ordinary the only Pond I Fiſht in, for I found a Play-houſe ſometimes convenient for my purpoſe, alſo Cockpits, Bowling-Greens and Ally's, neither muſt a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel be omitted, my Tackling was ſo good, and my Hooks ſo well barb'd, that after I had ſtruck a Gudgeon, I was ſure to hold him, though I ſuffer'd him to play a little in the Stream.</p>
            <p>If at any time, I caſually fell into the company of any young Country-Gentleman, whom his rich Father had ſent up to the City, to learn ſomewhat more than the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Country can afford, I and my companion (that Brother of mine in iniquity) did firſt ſtudy what humor he was of, when that was known, we had an excellent Art in ſuiting ours to his in every thing, this Artifice ſo indeared us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, that loans of money, engagements, and ſuch eaſie requeſts (as we call'd them) were ſeldom denied; and leaſt at any time, he ſhould repent him of thoſe exceſſes, in expence and high debaucheries, we conſtantly drew him <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>to by any ſerious reflection upon what was paſt, we kept
<pb facs="tcp:55449:7"/>him by turns, always in a high pitch of drinking, and like a careful Guardian to ſome wealthy Heireſs, we could not endure he ſhould be out of our ſight, leaſt falling into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther company he might be ſnatcht out of our hands, by ſome other Craftsby, and ſo we looſe our expected booty.</p>
            <p>Having thus, by much ſweat and induſtry adapted, and wrought him to ſuch a ſoft and waxen temper, that we could make him wear what impreſſion we pleaſed to lay on him; we then boldly venture abroad with him, having taught him to wear fine Clothes, and to leap out of one Faſhion into another, ſo often, till he had quite loſt the knowledge of himſelf, and the lateſt habit, <hi>A la mode.</hi> Having made our youngſter believe himſelf in <hi>Elizium,</hi> and thought that he enjoy'd more delights than the Turks believe their Paradiſe affords after death, we then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think our ſelves how to conclude the Play, the Prologue to which, are theſe, our ſeeming kindneſſes, and you would think them not ſmall, when you ſhall ſee us ſtrive who ſhall firſt lend him money, upon his leaſt pretence of want thereof; carry him to very handſome lovely wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and then with leaving him alone to the full fruition of his amourous deſires: aſſiſt him in all quarrels, but moſt of them of our own making; if challeng'd, ſecure him and his honour ſafe, whilſt we pretendedly fight for him, and it may be return from the ſuppoſed Field to his Chamber (where he waits till the danger is over) with a hand bound up in a Scarfe, where his Rogueſhip, my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Brother, begins a formal and ſerious ſpeech, telling him, what bloody work there had like to have been, how ſtrenuouſly and reſolvedly his cauſe was fought, to the loſs of ſome blood on his ſide, but it was no matter there is more ſtill left at his ſervice, and ſuch like fair deluding
<pb facs="tcp:55449:8"/>pretences; hereupon this Country Cock-brain, tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the conſideration of ſuch great effects of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, expreſſeth how much he is oblieged, nor can the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation be cancell'd, however he will ſtudy to be grateful, and in the firſt place promiſes to pay the Chyrurgion li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally to cure a wound (was never made;) next gives him a Silver Sword to weat for his ſake, which the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver promiſeth ſhall be worn on no other account, then for the defence and preſervation of the Giver; theſe and the like were but the petty forerunners of greater kindneſſes we expected to receive, which muſt be effected in their proper time and ſeaſon. As thus, when we prompted him to change of Apparel, the Mercer (who truſted him) knowing his Father to be wealthy, and he Heir to the Eſtate, gave us Credit alſo upon his account; and now and then, by a whiſper in the Ear, he was adviſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member Miſtris <hi>B</hi>—, or Miftris <hi>F</hi>— a Petty-coat or ſome ſuch thing ſhe wanted, which was done accordingly, and delivered into our hands, but went not out of them without a conſideration. By this you may underſtand our Gallant alſo was inſtructed in the Art of Whoring, and ſo exact an Obſervator of his Miſtreſſes, that he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to keep a Common-place-book, wherein he writ-the Names of thoſe <hi>Bona Robas</hi> Alphabetical digeſted, and that he might preſently recal to his memory their ſeveral complexions, he affixt to each name a little Lock of Hair which he took from the perſon, <hi>in perpetuam rei memoriam.</hi> When all his Money is ſpent, his Credit gone and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd, and his Father hearing of his extravagancies, and what deſolute, deſperate Company he keeps, then we think it is time to vaniſh, or diſappear, and leave out Cully in his Fools Paradiſe, to be handled at the diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Creditors.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:55449:8"/>
            <p>Whatever we got, by theſe indirect courſes, we equally ſhared, and thus continued a twelve moneth together, acting many Rogueries not all of a complexion; for we were now through paced in all manner of Villany; nor could it be expected, that our actions ſhould always meet with ſucceſs; for we were ſeveral times in Goal, and once I had like to have loſt my life, for robbing a Coach near <hi>Barnet,</hi> and without queſtion the Law had then put a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod to thoſe evil practices, had I not reſtored the Major part of the Mony and Goods to the right owner, on this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, at my Tryal they ſhould forbear bringing any evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againſt me, and ſo I was then acquitted by Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
            <p>So fair a warning, one would think ſhould have put a ſtop to ſuch proceedings, but it ſignified nothing to me, I rather think it was the cauſe of my hardning, for I thought with my ſelf, why may not I eſcape another time in the ſame manner, and that which much augmented this ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſecurity, was the frequent Pardons granted to the moſt notorious Malefactors, not once or twice; ſo that from thence grew a kind of proverbial ſaying, amongſt the Scout-Maſters of the Road, he can't be hang'd without Treaſon or Murder) who hath five hundred pounds at his command. Beſides, the impudence of my fellow Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, did much encreaſe my own, and made me boldly look upon my Irons, and preſently ſtare my Friends in the face, who came to ſee me without a bluſh.</p>
            <p>Being abroad again, I thought of nothing but my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and pleaſure, but purſued them with two much preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitancy; no villany lay fairly in my way, which I did not think my ſelf ſit for; and was ſtill encouraged to go on, by my Comrade; and was commonly in the Van, upon any
<pb facs="tcp:55449:9"/>deſperate exploit, having the knowledge of my VVeapon, and could uſe it as well as the beſt experienced Maſter of the Science in the Town.</p>
            <p>Now as ill Luck would have it, my conſtant Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion died, leaving little behind him, but his VVench, whom he bequeathed to me, enjoyning me to have a ſpecial care of her he ſo highly prized in his life time, I accepted of the Legacy, and took poſſeſſion immediately, without a forcible entry; for ſhe made preſently a willing ſurrender; <hi>'Tis pily ſhe is a Whore,</hi> for impartially, I may ſay it, her Beauty is ſcarcely to be parallel'd, nor her diſpoſition being highly ambitious, ſenſual and inſatiate; to oblige them all in ſome meaſure, I performed as much as I could, expend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all I had then by me, unlawfully gotten, and fearing I might looſe her beloved ſociety, for want of continuing my wonted kindneſſes to her, by Preſents, Treats, and Dalliances, I made the laſt ſerve for all, till I had found out ſome leſs dangerous, expedient, than Padding, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie her enlarged deſires, and that which prickt me for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, was her coldneſs more than uſual to me, which cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs did increaſe my fire, making me reſolve the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of any thing, then to be treated by her with ſo much indifference.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, I went and renew'd my acquaintance with an Ordinary, ſhall be nameleſs, and there I rookt ſometimes at one Table and ſometimes at another, but by reaſon of the ſcarcity of fair Gameſters, little was to be got, many times I waited an hour or two before I could ſee one ſtrange face come in, and if there did immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at his appearance, the Rooks are all alarm'd, and though before they were buſily pecking at one another for a ſhill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they ſhall now deſiſt their thoughts, being wholly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd,
<pb facs="tcp:55449:9"/>who ſhall firſt make prize of him. Now by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of late ſittings up there, and in an adjacent Tavern, I frequented, in hope of Booty, I was quite tyred out, and reſolved to go thither for the time to come upon a double account, the firſt was to win by play; ſecondly, if little could be got that way (for I was generally known an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Nicker) I might then obſerve who carry'd off good ſums of money, and by following them in the dark, take my advantage in ſome convenient place, and there diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs them of it, which I have frequently done, making choice of the darkeſt nights for my purpoſe) for Winter is the proper time for a Gaming Ordinary.</p>
            <p>I found it unſafe to take this courſe any longer, yet now and then got a conſiderable booty, which when I carry'd as a Tribute of Love to my fair Miſtreſs, no Frown could ſit upon her Brow, all feigned Anger was baniſht from her Countenance, but ſhe was all complaiſance, and but that I loved her in a more than common manner, her over loving and petulant deportment, would have raiſed in me a humour, rather loathing, than loving.</p>
            <p>So various and villainous were the Pranks I committed dayly, that now I was forced, like a Bat, never to flutter or ſtir abroad till the dusk of the Evening; if I did, it was the greateſt caution imaginable, and then too, I never ſtaid long in a place, for fear ſome or other had dogg'd me, in order to my apprehenſion; thus did I skulk here and there like the Dogs in <hi>Egypt,</hi> as it is reported, who when by thirſt, they go to drink of the River <hi>Nyle,</hi> lap here and there, and dare not ſtay long in a place, for fear the Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codiles, that lye lurking within the Banks, ſhould pull them into the Current.</p>
            <p>My Wench, ſeeing what ſtraights I was put to for her
<pb facs="tcp:55449:10"/>maintenance, which was none of the meaneſt, for the Whore, if ſhe dined, with me, without ſomething extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary and VVine to boot, I had better at night to have lain in a Tumbril, and if my over much kindneſs had pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd her to high with Meat or Drink, that was provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive (being of her ſelf naturally ſolacious) with more eaſe I might have lain between the ſheets with red-hot Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerpine, and therefore, when I perceived ſome ſymptoms which I uſed to mark, appear, I diſappear'd, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time after ſent her word I ſhould not lye at home: I ſay, my Miſs ſeeing all my Stratagems would not anſwer her expectation, ſhe reſolved to deſert me when I leaſt dream'd thereof; and now I cannot chooſe but rail at her whole ſex, for her ſake, rewarding my kindneſs with ſo much baſeneſs and ingratitude; for as ſhe carry'd away all I had left, ſo ſhe left me ſomething that was none of my own, a ſwinging Clap, which laid me up in pickle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ſix weeks before I was cured. At the the expirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of which time, walking in <hi>Hatton</hi> Garden, I met with three or four of my old acquaintance, Knights of the Road, and all of a Gang, men of ſuch undaunted reſolution and irreſiſtible courage, that threats of death, or extream torture (I am confident) would no ways dull the edges of their ſtout and matchleſs ſpirits.</p>
            <p>After a few ceremonies, at firſt meeting, it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, we ſhould drink a glaſs of Wine, and the next Tavern muſt be our Councel-Chamber, where in private we might conſult, what was beſt to be done. I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, how I had ſpent my time ſince my firſt Gaol-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery; I told them, who blamed me much for my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking ſuch mean things, as pilfering up and down, and making ſerzures of ſuch petty things, a generous bold
<pb facs="tcp:55449:10"/>Soul would ſcorn to take notice of; they condemned me not for keeping my Whore, but that I did not keep her more under; the thing is laudable ſaid one to have a Miſs, though he hath a very handſome VVife of his own, and is agreeable to the cuſtom and honour of the times, and ſhould we throw any <hi>approhium</hi> upon it, it would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Come ſaid another, we trifle away time, let us fall to buſineſs, it is a good while ſince we ſhared a Booty, let us lie no longer idle, and if our Brother will accompany us, inſtead of picking up here and there Crowns and Angels, (a thing beneath us) let us reſolve at <hi>Have at all;</hi> a five hours Adventure may make us poſſeſſors of five hundred pounds.</p>
            <p>I told them I was unprovided of an horſe, and other appurtenances neceſſary for the deſign; they preſently told me I ſhould be ſupplyed, and ſo I was accordingly, and as well provided for our intended expedition as any of them.</p>
            <p>The firſt Robbery that I committed, I told you was on a Coach near <hi>Barnet;</hi> The ſecond was this, we were four in Company, and took our Road towards <hi>Maiden-head,</hi> more for intelligence ſake than for any preſent Booty; in <hi>Maidenhead</hi> we din'd, and towards four a clock in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer time we travel'd on for Redding, making a little halt by the way at <hi>Maidenhead</hi> Thicket, expecting there to light upon ſome prize; having waited an hour or more to no purpoſe, we propoſed to diſtribute our ſelves, and Ride in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Redding</hi> ſingly, and that two ſhould lie in one Inn, and two in the other, for the better benefit of obſervation.</p>
            <p>My other two Comerades lay in an Inn where they were intimately acquainted, and were winkt at by the Maſter of
<pb facs="tcp:55449:11"/>the Houſe, the Servants alſo being at their Devotion; by whoſe means they underſtood that there was a Gentleman in the houſe who was the next morning with his Man, would ſet out for <hi>Malbrough,</hi> and that it was thought by the weight of a ſmall Port-mantue, that it muſt be mony that cauſed it to be ſo heavy. We on the other ſide could make no diſcovery till after Supper, and then we heard what our hearts deſired.</p>
            <p>An Attourney was in the company, and amongſt other talk, he ſaid he was bound for <hi>London</hi> to be there at the Term, and ask'd the Maſter of the Houſe (who was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him) whether he had any ſervice to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him thither, for in the Morning he would ſet forth: whereupon ſaid I, compoſing my countenance, I am ſorry I have not the happineſs then to morrow to have your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, for I muſt ride a contrary way to <hi>Briſtow;</hi> ſay you Sir, ſaid he, you ſeem a civil Gentleman, and I am ſorry too; and as a ſtranger, I wiſh you ſo much good will, have a care of <hi>Malbrough</hi> Downs, there are a parcel of whipper Snappers have been very buſie there of late, hereupon I ſtartled, and ſeemed to be very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, the Attourney perceiving that, called me, and told me if I had a conſiderable charge, he willed me to ſecure it ſome way or other for I ſhould certainly loſe it; <hi>I</hi> thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him ſomewhat coldly, as if <hi>I</hi> ſuſpected him ſome ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile inſinuating ſpye, he thereupon to free me from any ſuch jealouſie, put his hand in his pocket and pul'd out a Bagg wherein were an hundred and fifty Guinnies, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, theſe <hi>I</hi> will ſo conceal in the Saddle <hi>I</hi> ride upon that <hi>I</hi> will defie all the damn'd High-way-men in <hi>England</hi> to find them out, <hi>I</hi> have paſt them ſeveral times in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, with good ſums about me, and for your further
<pb facs="tcp:55449:11"/>belief <hi>I</hi> will ſhew you in what manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> gave him a thouſand thanks and aſſured him <hi>I</hi> would follow his advice; now did <hi>I</hi> not know without ſuſpition how to get out and inform my Comerades of this diſcovery; juſt in the interim a note came from them to meet them at ſuch a place, and ſo pretending bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs in the Town I went to them, where we concluded that I and my fellow ſhould rob the <hi>Marlebrough</hi> Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and they two ſhould rob the Attorney; which the next morning was performed, the Attorney thinking the Devil had given them information where his treaſure lay; we came not off ſo well, for though we gain'd the booty, which was ſix ſcore pound in ſilver, yet <hi>I</hi> was ſhot in the arm, and ſo ſtifly oppoſed by the Gentleman and his man, that had we not ſhot his Horſe in the Head, and ſo fell inſtantly dead, they had either killed or taken us Priſoners; this being done we met at the place appointed the laſt night for our general Rendezvous.</p>
            <p>The next time that we went upon the ſame account we met with a pleaſant adventure, for after we had robbed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral to the making up of a ſum above one hundred and eighty pound, we were all ſtrangely robbed of it by one.</p>
            <p>Hearing ſome Seamen were to be paid off at <hi>Chattham</hi> ſuch a day, and knowing that <hi>London</hi> is the Centre that attracts and invites them to ſpend their hard gotten mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, we went down to <hi>Shooters-hill</hi> and hovered therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts till evening, but got little booty; the next day to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the afternoon we pickt up a great many ſtraglers and robbed them of their mony, ſome more and ſome leſs, but when there was four or five in a body, nay, if but three, we ſhun'd them as much as they would have
<pb facs="tcp:55449:12"/>done us, had they known what we were. At length a Parſon coming from <hi>London</hi> fell in amongſt us, whom we robb'd without any reſpect to his Coat, neither could we have judg'd by the meanneſs of his habit and the poorneſs of his horſe with the ſhortneſs of his journey, that he could have had above an Attorneys retaining Fee about him; but thinking to make ſome ſpeedy ſport with him (and ſo diſmiſs him) by ſearching his Pockets, the attempt was no ſooner ſlightly made (and had never been proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) but that he roar'd like a Town Bull, he was utterly undone, then did I ſearch him throughly, and from that time afterwards in all my Robberies I learn'd to ſearch ſo ſtrictly, that ſooner might the <hi>Pope</hi> turn Quaker, then for any of them to conceal a penny from me; and ſeeing what ſeverities my unconſcionable and cruel companions uſed to thoſe Seamen, who had ventur'd their lives for their King and Country, and at laſt to be deprived of their long lookt for reward, taught me to be as deaf too when the poor Traveller cryed <hi>I am undone,</hi> and my heart in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time grew flinty and not to be moved with ſighs and tears.</p>
            <p>This Parſon had fifteen pound about him, all which we took from him, but return'd him twenty ſhillings, if he would engage on his word, nay ſwear that he would inform none he met with what had hapned, or following us by Hue and Cry, or by general raiſing of the Towns about us near adjacent.</p>
            <p>The Parſon minding more the loſs of his mony then the breach of his Oath meeting with a Seaman (as we were informed afterwards) adviſed him to turn back if he had any mony, for but a little before there were a parcel of Rogues that juſt now rob'd him of 15 l. and will infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb facs="tcp:55449:12"/>do the like to him if he proceeded farther. The reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Seaman would not believe the Parſon, thinking it ſome idle <hi>Chymera</hi> of his own invention, and ſo went on his way, and the Parſon on his: coming up to the Seaman we bid him ſtand; who askt us what we meant, we told him that we wanted mony; alas Gentlemen, ſaid he, it is true I have ſome, which I received for my pay in his Majeſties ſervice, and therefore it is pitty to take that from me which I am carrying home for the maintainance of my poor Wife and Children. If he had perſwaded an Angel to have been his Orator and pleaded in his behalf, it would have been all one, for no other ſound pleaſed us but that of his mony; when he ſaw that there was no remedy, he delivered all that he had, which which was ſixty five pound. Now Gentlemen ſaid he, let me beg one requeſt of you, and that is, ſince I dare not go home to my Wife, and at preſent know not what courſe of life to ſteer, admit me into your company, you ſee I am limb'd well enough and I have courage and ſtrength enough to quallifie me for your occupation. We askt him whether he was in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, he ſwore a hundred Oaths he was in earneſt, and was ready to be tryed at that inſtant; inſiſting farther, that he was greatly in love with a Trade that could get as much mony in ſix minutes, as he could do in three years.</p>
            <p>I was then Purſe-bearer; and finding we had done e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for that day, we appointed a place to meet at, and ſo diſtributed our ſelves for the preſent; only I had the charge of the Sea-man, who was wretchedly mounted, and therefore I needed not to fear him: Beſides, as we rid along, I bound him over and over again, by Oaths, to ſtand to what promiſe he had made us. At length,
<pb facs="tcp:55449:13"/>riding in a Lane, ſuſpecting nothing in the leaſt, he turns his little Hobby upon me, and ſiezing my Bridle before I was aware, claps to my Breaſt a little ugly Braſs-barrel'd Piſtol, and ſwore as bloodily, as if he had been one of the Trade above twenty years, if I would not inſtantly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount, he wou'd ſend a Bullet to my Heart. I ſaw by his frightful countenance that there was no dallying, ſo I diſmounted and gave him my Horſe; and he in kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs bid me take his: ſuch a Beaſt I never ſaw on a Common, ſo poor, ſo weak, that I was thinking to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my ſafety to my own, and not to his legs.</p>
            <p>You may imagine what a ſweat I was in being thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted, for having committed ſo many Robberies that day, ſhould I be met by any of the Country, they would conclude me one of the Robbers, ſeeing a man ſo ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly accoutred, riding on a Beaſt hardly fit to feed Crows and Ravens.</p>
            <p>The night coming on favour'd me, and I got among my Aſſociat<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>; and now I ſhall give you leave to gueſs, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their laughter or ſorrow was greateſt? Firſt, that a ſtout Thief (for ſo I was accounted) ſhould be rob'd by a Hobby-horſe and a Pot-gun. And ſecondly, ſo much Money loſt, when ſecured beyond the probability of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.</p>
            <p>We heard the Sea-man, after he had paid himſelf, ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned in ſuch Brethren as had been rob'd by us, and none elſe (but the Parſon) and returned them their Money.</p>
            <p>Should <hi>I</hi> enumerate all the Rogueries and Robberies <hi>I</hi> committed, either ſingly, or with others, relating in what manner they were done, <hi>I</hi> ſhall waſte too much time, and miſs of that deſign which <hi>I</hi> purpoſed to my ſelf, which is the general good of my Country-men: wherefore <hi>I</hi> ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:55449:13"/>paſs them all by, not ſo much as mentioning the laſt Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery <hi>I</hi> was guilty of near <hi>Colebrook,</hi> when perſued by the Country, oppoſed and apprehended by them, to the loſs of our own, and the Bloud of ſome of them; the manner whereof is too generally known to be again repeated, and therefore leaving this, and the like ſtories, <hi>I</hi> ſhall inſiſt on as is more profitable; and therein diſcover, firſt, what a High-way-man is; how bound by Oath; what Order is preſcribed; in what manner they Aſſault; and how they behave themſelves in and after the Action. In the next place my beſt endeavor ſhall be, to diſſwade theſe Deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoes to deſiſt Robbing on the High-way, by ſhewing them the certainty of their Apprehenſion one time or other; and though they may a long time proſper in that vile courſe of life, ſpending high, and faring deliciouſly, yet every bit is attended with fear; neither is their ſleep leſs unquiet, ſtarting ever and anon by ſome horrid Dream; ſo that <hi>I</hi> cannot ſay, when they go to bed, they go to take their reſt; but only to ſlumber out the tedious minutes of the gloomy night in horror and affrightment. <hi>I</hi> ſhall inſiſt on other diſſwaſions, by ſhewing them the miſery of a Priſon; by putting them in mind of their wretched and curſed Ends, which they vainly jeſt at, by preſuming on ſome Examples of Grace; and the Reward of their Wickedneſs in the World to come. Laſtly, Inſtructions, not only for the honeſt Traveller that he may paſs in ſafety, but for the Inn-Keeper to diſtinguiſh High-way-men from Gueſts that are honeſt. All theſe <hi>I</hi> ſhall with ſincerity run over particularly.</p>
            <p>High-way-men for the moſt part are ſuch, who never were acquainted with an honeſt Trade, whom either want of Money or Employment prompt them to undertake theſe
<pb facs="tcp:55449:14"/>dangerous Deſigns; and to make their Perſons appear more formidable, and to gain reſpect, they dub one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Colonel, Major, or at leaſt a Captain, who never arrived to a greater height than a Trooper disbanded, or at the utmoſt a Life-guard-man caſheer'd for miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour.</p>
            <p>Having made up a Party, e're they proceed to act their Villanies, they make a ſolemn Vow to each other, that if by misfortune any one ſhould be Apprehended, he ſhall not diſcover his Complices; and that if he be preſt hard to particularize his Companions, he muſt then device names for men that never were, deſcribing their perſons, features, and diſcovering their habitations, but ſo remote one from another, that the danger of the Tryal may be over e're ſufficient enquiry can be made.</p>
            <p>And further, to procure mercy from the Bench, there muſt be a plauſible account given, how you fell into this courſe of life; fetching a deep ſigh, ſaying, That you were well born; but by reaſon of your Family falling to decay, you were expoſed to great want, and rather then ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully beg (for you knew not how to labour) you were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to take this courſe for a ſubſiſtence; that it is your firſt fault, which you are heartily ſorry for, and will never attempt the like again.</p>
            <p>Having taken a ſolemn Oath to be true one to another, their next buſineſs is, to acquaint themſelves by Tapſters, Hoſtlers, Chamberlains, or others, what Booties are ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, how contain'd, and whether bound. But before they attempt the ſiezure, if any Novice be in the Company, then are they inſtructed by the more experienced, as <hi>I</hi> was at firſt, after this manner.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, you muſt have variety of Periwigs
<pb facs="tcp:55449:14"/>planted in your Lodgings; and the like you muſt carry abroad, if occaſion require the neceſſity of changing the colour of the hair: neither muſt you be without your falſe Beards of ſeveral colours; for want of them, you may only croſs your locks athawrt your mouth, which is a good diſguiſe: Patches contribute much thereto. And leaſt your Voice ſhould be known another time by him that is robbed, put into your mouth a Pebble, or any ſuch like thing, which will alter your tone advantagiouſly to your purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Being thus provided, a Watch-word muſt be fram'd, wrapt up in ſome common queſtion, as, What's a Clock? or <hi>Jack,</hi> What ſhall we have for Supper? to avoid put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Traveller into ſuſpition; which as ſoon named, you muſt inſtantly fall to your work, ſiezing with your left hand the Bridle, and with your right preſently a Piſtol: This ſo terrifies, that he delivers inſtantly; for who will truſt a Piſtol at his Breaſt loaded with a brace of Bullets, and a mouth diſcharging at the ſame time volleys of Oaths, that if he deliver not inſtantly, he is a dead man? But here in you may chuſe to believe him, for he will be very cautious of Murder, for fear of provoking the Law to an implacability; unleſs it be when he is beſet, that rather than run the hazard of hanging, he muſt endeavor his eſcape by the death of one or more of his Aſſiſtants.</p>
            <p>Having o're maſter'd them you ſet upon, then do you carry them into ſome Covert, where you ſearch ſo ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that nothing can be hidden from you; If in the ſtrict enquiry Gold be found privately quilted in a Doublet, or Waſte-band of his, Breeches, <hi>I</hi> can hardly forbear ſmiling, when <hi>I</hi> think, in, what manner theſe Rogues will ſlaye the poor man, with V<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ain, cheating Raſcal, for endeavouring
<pb facs="tcp:55449:15"/>to preſerve his own; whilſt he hath nothing elſe to ſay, but that <hi>he is undone:</hi> which they regard with as little, as the Hangman will do them at the place of Execution. Having chang'd your Horſes for theirs, if better than your own, the next thing you do, is to make them ſwear, neither to follow you, nor to raiſe the Country with an Hue and Cry upon you. Thus having the poor Traveller forlorn away, you ride to ſome ſtrange place, or where you are known and winkt at, and there you ſhare what unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully you got, not without the cheating one another.</p>
            <p>Now here by the way, give me leave a little to deſcant on their Prodigality, after an attempt that proves ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. <hi>London,</hi> the more is the pity, is their beſt Sanctuary; and therefore after any Robbery, they commonly repair thither; having as many Names as Lodgings, and both as changeable as a Whores dalliances with variety of Perſons. Their next care is, to buy variety of ſplendid Apparel; and having bought his Wench a new Gown, and furniſht her Pockets with Guynnies, they then proſecute to the height all manner of Debaucheries, which by a miſtaken name they call, <hi>The Chief of Pleaſures.</hi> And as their Whore, ſo muſt their Hoſt participate with them in their Gain, elſe all the fat is in the fire; for the Vintner, Inn-Keeper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> knowing very well what they are, and how eaſily they get their Money, will be ſure to inlarge their Reckoning, and make it ſwell prodigiouſly; neither muſt this be complain'd of, leſt they refuſe to keep their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel any longer.</p>
            <p>All the time they can ſpare from robbing and undoing poor harmleſs men, is ſpent in Wine and Women; ſo that the Sun-ſhine of their proſperity laſts but a moment, not ſo long as to warm their hands by the blazing fire of
<pb facs="tcp:55449:15"/>their Prodigality, before cold Death comes and ſiezeth them; and how can it be otherwiſe expected, the Pitcher goes not ſo often to the Well, but it comes broken home at laſt.</p>
            <p>But before Death takes them from this to carry them before an higher Tribunal, there to anſwer for all they have acted here on earth, there is a puniſhment preceeding this, which makes my ſoul ſtartle at the thoughts thereof; it is a Priſon wherein are contain'd ſo many tortures, woes and pains, which I do think were enough to puniſh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out death the greateſt of offences; now ſince I cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the horror of this Hell on Earth, <hi>I</hi> ſhall admoniſh all to have a care, that their evil actions compel them not to feel the pain, and let thoſe who have already indured the ſmart thereof, be deterr'd by thoſe ſufferings from ever again eſpouſing ſuch pernicious practices which may venter them into their former deſpicable and deplorable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>Having thus indeavoured to fright High-way-men, by ſhowing them the intollerable torments of a Priſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the certainty and ſhamefulneſs of Hanging, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of Eternal Death hereafter. <hi>I</hi> ſhall here take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courſe to ſcare them if poſſible, and therefore in the firſt place <hi>I</hi> ſhall lay down Directions how to know them as they ride on the Road, with rules how to ſhun them, or if Robbed, how to purſue and apprehend them when they think themſelves moſt ſecure.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place when at any time you intend to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, and cannot avoid carrying a ſum of mony with you, let no perſon know what charge you have, or when you will ſet forward. It is a cuſtom I confeſs (but I can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you it is dangerous) for men the day before they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<pb facs="tcp:55449:16"/>their journey, to take their leave of their Relations and Friends, drinking healths round to the happy return of the Traveller, who ſuſpects not the leaſt harm in all this, whereas it hath been known that a Father this way hath been betrayd by his own Son, a Brother by a Brother, nay one pretendedly dear friend betray another, by diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to High-way-men, when and which way he rides, bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them to prepare accordingly, either to meet or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertake, and for the plot ſo laid he goes his ſhare.</p>
            <p>Another way of ſetting they have in this manner; the Gang ſhall ride before out of ſight, leaving one luſty fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of their company behind, who ſhall ride very ſoftly expecting ſome perſon or other who ſhall overtake him; if three or four, he will ſingle out one he thinks hath the moſt mony, and pretending much kindneſs, whiſpers him in the ear, ſaying, that he likes not thoſe men, and asks him if he knows them? if not, he adviſeth him by all means to ſlacken his pace, for certainly they are dangerous fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows; this timerous piece of credulity thanks him for his honeſt care, and takes his advice, and not long after brings him to the place where his Confederates lye in Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſcado, who upon ſight of them draws, bidding the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to do the like; and now begins a dangerous Fight, as the Traveller imagines, who through fear of blood-ſhed delivers his mony, and perſwades his Champion to do the like, who with much adoe at length condeſcends thereunto; having given him a private <hi>Item</hi> which way they intend to ride, they ſet Spurs to their Horſes, and are out of ſight in an inſtant.</p>
            <p>Hereupon this pretender to honeſty will ſtraight per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you to aſſiſt him in making an Hue and Cry, in the carrying on of which to be ſure he will be the foremoſt as
<pb facs="tcp:55449:16"/>ſeemingly moſt zealouſly active in the apprehenſion of theſe Robbers, to no other end then to lead you quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, till his Brethren be out of all danger. I knew one notorious Rogue (but by his ſly and craſty deportment was lookt upon to be a very honeſt Gentleman) ſuffer'd himſelf to be robbed with three more, by four of his own Confederates, the Robbery being committed between Sun and Sun, he with thoſe three honeſt men ſued the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and recovered the mony they had loſt.</p>
            <p>Whenſoever the Traveller deſigns his journey, let him conſider the Sabbath day is a time not only unlawful, but more dangerous for Robbing than any other. I need not expatiate my ſelfon the illegality of the act, ſince there is a ſpecial command forbidding the breach of that holy day of reſt, the violation whereof hath been frequently puniſht by being rob'd; for to ſpeak the truth, that day hath been, and is ſtill choſen by High-way-men for the beſt and fitteſt time to commit their Robberies; firſt becauſe they are ſenſible that few Travell then, but ſuch who ride about ſome eminent concern, and do ſuppoſe to that end carry a conſiderable ſum about them. In the next place, on that day the Roads are moſt quiet, being undiſturbed with great quantities of People, and therefore rob with more eaſe and greater ſecurity. Laſtly, they know the Country will not be ſo forward to purſue them with an Hue and Cry, whereas they cannot but be ſenſible that a judge will hardly be induced to make the Country pay the reparation of a loſs ſuſtained by him, who ought to have ſtaid at home and perform thoſe duties required from him proper to the day, and not wander abroad and leave his Creators buſineſs undone, that he may do his own. If you needs muſt travel, you have days enough in the week
<pb facs="tcp:55449:17"/>to follow your urgent and important affairs, with more ſecurity, the Roads being then full of good company, if you will make choice of a convenient time, and be cautious whom you entertain into your Society.</p>
            <p>The firſt caution is this, be ſhy of thoſe who are over prone in proſſing into your company; it is more ſafe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain ſuch who are unwilling to aſſociate themſelves with you, or if they do it is with ſuch indifferency, that there need the urging of perſwaſions to effect it. Now to the intent you may diſtinguiſh an honeſt man from a Thief or Robber, take theſe informations and directions; firſt if you ſuſpect your company, halt a little, and in your ſtay ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve whether they ſtill hold on their courſe, or ſlack their pace, or it may be alight and walk with their Horſes in their hands, if you obſerve any of theſe, you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them the juſtly ſuſpected marks of an High-way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; but theſe following are infallible, the putting on a Cypreſs hood or a Vizard Mask upon your near approach, are ſigns they preſently will bid you ſtand and deliver, or if before they ſhrowd their helliſh looks with thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes, ſtare any of them in the face boldly, and if he turns his head aſide, be thence forewarned to ſtand a loof and provide for your preſervation, neither is there any more certain <hi>Indicium</hi> of a Robber, then the incongruity of his buſhy Beard and Face, his whiſpering or his more incivil paying and inquiry whether you are travelling, or about what buſineſs.</p>
            <p>Beware of joyning company with one ſingle on the Road, although you have a friend with you; his pretence will be to inſinuate himſelf into your good opinion, that having a charge about him, he is over joy'd to meet with two whoſe face and actions diſcover nothing but
<pb facs="tcp:55449:17"/>what is honeſt, and in a little riding will preſume to call you honeſt fellow Traveller, in a ſhort time it may be three of his Companions will over take you, at the ſight of whom he ſhakes and ſeems to be in the greateſt agony imaginable; at length he ſays with trembling, in troth Gentlemen, I doubt me we are way-laid, therefore ſtand to't if you have any Piſtols, otherwiſe if you have any ſtore of mony, the beſt way will be to fly for it.</p>
            <p>It may be you have thoſe grim handfuls, Deaths ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Executioners, and minding well the number of thoſe you fear will be ſo bold to aſſault you, and finding no inequality, your courage probably may prompt you to an oppoſition if cauſe require; but you will then find quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you ſuppoſed friend turn Cat in Pan, and be on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, and being thus over matcht, muſt either yield your monies quietly or do worſe.</p>
            <p>Sometimes there will be one or more of theſe Trapan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Raſcals, who having attired himſelf every way like a Country-man, with rouls of Hay about his leggs, an old hat flapping over his eyes, with a broad Leathern Girdle about his middle with great Buckles, riding aſide on his Horſe with a Goad inſtead of a riding rod; I ſay this fellow ſhall ride in company with you, asking very ſilly queſtions, and ſinging a Country Song to ſome hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible tune, all to raiſe laughter, when by this means he hath lull'd you into a ſenſeleſs ſecurity, and not ſuſpecting in the leaſt any harm from him, he inſtantly aſſaults you and his complices come inſtantly into his ſuccour, who ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing you thus unawares are without difficulty made a prey to their unlawful deſires.</p>
            <p>You ſee how dangerous a thing it is to Travel with a
<pb facs="tcp:55449:18"/>charge about you in the day time, unleſs you have a very circumſpect care not only in your Inn, but on the Road, if therefore you cannot avoid Travelling, and that with ſtore of mony, the immergency of your buſineſs requiring it, undertake your journey in the night, for High-way men think that none will be ſo mad to ride at that unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time, unleſs they are miſerable poor, beſides, it is dangerous for them to be abroad for fear of ſuſpition, and that is not all neither, for how can they ſee to take their beſt advantage in the dark, not knowing how many, what men, and how arm'd, they aſſault; beſides, ſhould they gain the better of it, the obſcurity of the night gives them the advantage of dropping their Money into a Ditch, or other place convenient.</p>
            <p>Now to adviſe you for the beſt, at what time ſoever you ride, take notice that your High-Pads do always keep their ſtation upon your greateſt and moſt beaten Roads, whereby they have the advantage of picking and chuſing; now if you would be ſafe, make choice of ſuch Roads which are leſs frequented.</p>
            <p>If you ride ſeveral in company, ſhun that idle cuſtom of buſling up all together, when you come near any place noted for robbing, for by this means you are all catcht, like a Covy in a Net, at once; for theſe Rogues divide themſelves, and make ſeveral ſtands, and by this means they may ſet upon you before and behind; but if you ride about an hundred paces diſtant one from the other, I'le warrant your ſafety; for they date not ſet upon a ſcatter'd Company, for fear that ſome eſcaping the Country ſhould be alaim'd, and ſo endanger their immediate taking.</p>
            <p>Now ſhould you perceive them divide as well as you, and each drawing near him he intends to ſet upon, you
<pb facs="tcp:55449:18"/>have then fair warning, and running will hardly avail any thing; but fight like men, you have two to one the odds, though not in numbers, yet in a good conſcience; which they wanting, their own guilt and fear fights againſt them, and diſarms them: whilſt thus you contend with them, there is hopes ſome may come in to your reſcue.</p>
            <p>By the way let me tell you, I have known when we have been thus engaged, that ſome have come up to us, whom we have perſwaded to keep on their way, and not meddle with what they were unconcerned with; at which theſe baſe Coxcombs (nay, now I muſt call them unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Raſcals) have quietly rid away, and leſt thoſe men to our mercies, or rather to exerciſe our cruelties upon; whereas had they ſided with them, we muſt have fled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; for though we had courage (it may be enough) yet we durſt not fight it out, when we meet with thoſe that are bold and ſtout; for in ſo doing we not only fight them, but the whole Country,</p>
            <p>By the way let me diſcover an egregious fault in ſome men, who will not only yield patiently to be rob'd, but are content to let the Thieves go clearly off, nay wiſh they may eſcape, ſo that the Country may lie liable to make good the Robbery, if they take them not by an Hue and Cry; nay, ſuch is the baſeneſs of their principles, that they commonly double the ſum, knowing that the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred will be willing to compound, and thus abuſe the Thief and Country too.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding all theſe cautions, ſhould it happen ſo that you are ſurprized by theſe High-way-men, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter'd, and that you muſt yield, give them fair words, and without a compulſive ſearch, deliver freely ſome part of your Money, with a wiſh that you had more at their
<pb facs="tcp:55449:19"/>ſervice, and it may be they will trouble themſelves no farther with you; however, if they offer, ſhew no diſlike, for if you do, it will but provoke them to the ſeverity of a more rigorous ſearch, to the diſcovery of what you had moſt cunningly conceal'd.</p>
            <p>Have a ſpecial care that you let them not perceive you eye them too much, it being of a dangerous conſequence, for by this means they either think you know ſome of them, or are taking ſome remarkable ſigns and tokens how you may know them another time, which may endanger your life.</p>
            <p>After the Robbery committed, their uſual Charge is, Not ſtir from the place they put you in, till they have time enough to be gone a conſiderable diſtance; and that if they find you offer to purſue them, they will ſwear a thouſand Oaths to be your death; and being deſperate, for ought I know, they may be as good as their words: therefore be not too haſty in the purſuit, leaſt it being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, the foremoſt dropping into a by-Lane, ſtarts out upon you, ſiezeth you again, and if you eſcape cutting, you ſhall not binding, and ſo may be bound in a Ditch till ſome commiſerating Paſſenger releaſe you. Wherefore follow after at a diſtance, till you can procure a Hue and Cry, which you muſt direct not ſtraight on, but croſs the Country, which is a ſubtle practiſe, and their conſtant cuſtom; by this means they have the benefit of reſting themſelves, and refreſhing their Horſes before the lazy Hue and Cry can overtake them. If cloſely purſued by it, they will freequently ſquat like a Hare, and let the Hue and Cry paſs them, and then ride back again to the place where the Robbery was committed.</p>
            <p>Be ſure in your purſuit to ſcour the next great right and
<pb facs="tcp:55449:19"/>left hand Road, and if you cannot unkennel them that night, ſet Spies, and a thouſand to one you ſhall ſee them come riding by the next morning.</p>
            <p>If the purchaſe be great they ſiezed upon, you may be then confident they will that night repair to their General Rendezvouz here in the City, which is their great <hi>Azylum,</hi> and chiefeſt place of Refuge and Security. The largeneſs of the City, and the little cognizance one takes of another therein, is the main reaſon why ſo many Robberies are committed nigh <hi>London,</hi> and ſo few remotely diſtant from it. Now ſince twenty or thirty miles about <hi>London</hi> is the Stage on which theſe High-way-men act their parts, I ſhall diſcover when rob'd how to purſue them with Hue and Cry.</p>
            <p>If you are ſet upon and rob'd in the Eaſtern quarter, take not that Road in which you were to <hi>London,</hi> nor raiſe the Country thereabout, for it is to no purpoſe; but ride with all ſpeed to <hi>Holbourn, Strand,</hi> St. <hi>Jameſes,</hi> or <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> and there ſearch with all diligence. If you are rob'd towards the North, never ſearch any place in the City, but make all convenient ſpeed to the <hi>Bank-ſide, Southwark, Lambeth,</hi> or <hi>Fox-hall;</hi> by thus planting themſelves, they know, or think at leaſt, they are ſufficiently ſecure, having the City between them and you.</p>
            <p>And now, e're I proceed, let me take notice of a great folly and abuſe of the Country men: When report is brought to a Juſtice of a Robbery done in ſuch a place, preſently a Watch is ordered to ſtand at that place, at the charge of the Country; is any one ſo ſenſeleſs, to think thoſe High-way-men will voluntarily ride into the mouths of thoſe who are appointed to apprehend them? however, admit they ſhould continue ſcouring that Road,
<pb facs="tcp:55449:20"/>the Watch-men are conſtantly fixt at one place, ſo that but a little way out of their ſight, the High-way-man may do what he liſt, and meet with more Booties than if the Road lay unwarded; for all Travellers will cover to ride that way in which is placed a Watch; for who can imagine Thieves will be ſo bold as to rob near them? which they do to chuſe; for well they know, that thoſe Watch-men are ſilly old decreeped men, and though a douzen of them, I have ſeen ſtand with Halberts in their hands, yet have we rob'd before their very faces, and they ſtood ſtill the while, not daring to oppoſe us in the leaſt; it may be when we were gone out of ſight, they would make an Out-cry, and pretend to purſue, though to no purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Once we reſolved to ſet upon the Watch, which was done ſo effectually, that we diſarm'd them; and having taken them aſide out of the way, bound them; after this we perſonated them in their places, and ſtanding with our Brown bills, as with authority, we ſtopt whom we pleas'd, and having Rob'd them, bid them to be guarded by the Country-watch, and to ſecure them, bound them in like manner.</p>
            <p>It is now high time to inform the Inn-keeper how he ſhall diſtinguiſh High-way-men from honeſt Travellers; in the firſt place obſerve their curioſity about their horſes, in dreſſing and feeding them, next you will find them ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of queſtions, as who owns that horſe, and who the other, what their Maſters are, whither Travelling, and when will they ſet out; theſe are infallible ſigns of a High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way-man; nor muſt I omit this remark, let the Hoſtler poiſe their Cloak-bags, and he ſhall find them empty, which they carry only for ſhow, and not to burthen their Horſes.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:55449:20"/>
            <p>Next, let the Chamberlain take notice, when he ſhows them to a Room, that they will ſoon diſmiſs him, and after that, let him liſſen a while, and he ſhall hear the gingling of mony, and if he can but get a peep-hole for his eyes, he ſhall ſee them ſharing their booty.</p>
            <p>It will be very requiſite to enquire ſeverally each ones particular name, and let your Servants do the like, by this means you find them tripping, for they may eaſily forget a name they borrowed that very day.</p>
            <p>At Supper time, let ſome one knock furiouſly and haſtily at the Gate, then mark them well, and you ſhall ſee them ſtart, their countenances change, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but fear and amazement appearing in each face, by which you may poſitively conclude them what you before did but imagine and ſuſpect.</p>
            <p>If in the day time they come into your Inn, you may gueſs what they are by trifling away their time, and ſtaying ſomewhat longer then is requiſite for baiting; you ſhall obſerve them ſometimes looking out of the Window, ſometimes ſtanding at the Gate, for no other end but to mark what Paſſengers Ride by; if they perceive any perſon of Quality to Ride that way, or the Garb diſcovers any thing of a Booty, you ſhall have them preſently in all haſt, as alarm'd to Horſe, mount preſently, as it ſome dear Friend or near Relation was juſt Rid by, whom they muſt endeavour to overtake.</p>
            <p>At Night they will come dropping into an Inn ſeverally, in divided companies, thereby to croſs the number in the Hue and Cry, and will, when met ſubtilly, take no notice of one another, nay, to blind the eyes of ſuſpition, they will enquire of the Hoſt, what Country Gentlemen their own Companions are, whether he knows them or not, and if it be convenient to joyn in Company with
<pb facs="tcp:55449:21"/>them; if you find they have no jealouſie of them, they will as ſtrangers complement one another whilſt any eyes are on them, but withdraw and watch them well, and you ſhall find them fall into their uſual familiarity, and will not only rejoyce at the ſucceſs of their deſigns, but laugh at the credulity of their Landlord.</p>
            <p>Much more might be written on this ſubject, but ſince it is impoſſible to diſcover the whole Art and Myſtery of the High-way trade, let this ſuffice, for according to the Proverb, new Lords, new Laws; ſo all new Gangs have new Orders, Plots and Deſigns, to Rob and Purloin from the honeſt Traveller.</p>

               <hi>REader, let me aſsure thee this is no fiction, but a true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Mr.</hi> Jackſons <hi>life and converſation, Pen'd by his own hand, and delivered into mine to be made publick for his Countrymens good, in compenſation of the many injuries he hath done them. The Introduction he writ whilſt in</hi> Newgate, <hi>after ſentence of Condemnation, and deſired me to Apologize for it, ſeaning he had neither writ large enough of his true penitence, nor had laid down ſufficient dehortations from the commiſsion of the like offences; the diſorder he was in, lying under the horror of a ſpeedy and more than common Execution, may plead his excuſe: the plainneſs of his Style may admit of this Plea, that he aimed at (as he confeſt to me) nothing but the good of his Countrymen, and that as he had pickt their Pockets, he thought it needleſs to tickle their ears with the gilded ſtraws of Rhetorical expreſſions. God I hope hath forgiven him his ſins, and may we all amend by his Errors, for which he now hangs in Chains at</hi> Hampſtead, <hi>a ſad and dreadful Spectacle to all Beholders, and hoping you will paſs by the faults of his Writing and the Preſs, I ſubſcribe my ſelf a well-willer to all,</hi>
