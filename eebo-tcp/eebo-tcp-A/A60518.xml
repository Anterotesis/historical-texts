         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49139:5"/>
that the right underſtanding

or aſſuredly could
fix a firm Belief, or relye

Expoſitions, caſhiering
all the reſt, which muſt be
done, there being but one
Truth to inſiſt upon; for to
believe this or that, is to
believe we know not

            <p>Thus being not able
to give my ſelf any ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
herein, at laſt I
called to my remembrance
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49139:6"/>
that once it was told me,
that Mr. <hi>John Selden,</hi> that
learned Lawyer and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Antiquary (now in
<hi>Abraham</hi>'s boſome) held a
ſingular Opinion of his
own touching this Article
different from all others,
much afterwards approved
by many judicious Men:
Hereupon (for my own
ſatisfaction) being deſirous
to know what was his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
herein, I went purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unto him to be reſolved
thereof; who freely at my
requeſt, declared to me his
Opinion thereof, which
was this, That by theſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49139:6"/>
words in the Creed, <hi>He
deſcended into Hell,</hi> was
meant, that the Soul of
Chriſt reſting in Heaven,
whither it went immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
after his death (like
as we believe all the Souls
of the faithful do) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
good his promiſe to
the good Thief on the
Croſs, ſaying to him, <hi>To
day ſhalt thou be with me in
Paradiſe,</hi> Luk. 23. 43: That
Soul of Chriſt, I ſay, the
third day after his Body
had lyen interred in the
Grave (according to Chriſts
prediction, and application
of the Prophet <hi>Jonas lying
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49139:7"/>
three days and three nights in
the Whales belly,</hi> Matt. 12.
40.) did deſcend from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
into Hell, (that is,
into the Grave, uſually in
the Scripture call'd Hell)
and then uniting it ſelf to his
Body, did quicken and
raiſe it up again from
the dead, or place of the
dead, which was the Grave,
unto life in an inſtant; all
which is undeniable; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
fulfilling the Prophecy
of King <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 16. 10.
(though otherwiſe expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
<hi>Thou ſhalt not leave my
Soul in Hell, nor ſuffer thine
Holy One to ſee corruption:</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:49139:7"/>
Which place of Scripture
(granting that by this
word [Hell] in the Creed is
meant the Grave, as the
Original will carry it)
may very aptly be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to this Deſcenſion into
the Grave: thus, It cannot
be denied but that his Soul
was in the Grave in his
Body the third day after
his burial, deſcending thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to raiſe it up again to
life; for without the Soul,
the dead Body of it ſelf
naturally could not move
nor remove: and ſo the
Soul being thus deſcended
into Hell or the Grave,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49139:8"/>
was not left there at all
(as it muſt be granted by
them of the other Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that it was left in Hell
the place of the Damned,
though for no long time.)
For if it had continued any
ſpace of time in the
Grave termed Hell, it ſo
continuing there (though
never ſo little time)
might have been ſaid to
have for that time been
left there; and ſo this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
in that point had
not been fulfilled. But I
think, no man will deny,
that the Soul, ſo ſoon as
ever it deſcended into Hell
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49139:8"/>
or the Grave into the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
there lying, both Soul
and Body without any
ſtaying there, was not left
there, but in the twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of an Eye being united
together, immediately roſe
again from the Dead, (that
is from the Grave, the place
of the Dead) and ſo I ſay,
was not left at all in Hell,
that is in the Grave; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Prophecy in this
point <hi>(in leaving the Soul
in Hell)</hi> was upon the
Reſurrection fulfilled. The
laſt part of the Verſe of
this <hi>Pſalm</hi> is alſo fulfilled
by the raiſing of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49139:9"/>
incorrupt (by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the Deity) of which
there is no Queſtion or Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
made.</p>
            <p>In this Opinion of Mr.
<hi>Selden</hi>'s (granting the word
Hell to ſignify the Grave)
there is no Tautologie, or
twice re-iteration of the
ſelf ſame thing, no acuro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie
or impropriety, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
or abſurdity, no hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteron-proteron,
no diſorder
in the poſition of it in the
Creed, but placed orderly
in its proper place accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Series of the
Creed; nor is it involved
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49139:9"/>
in any Myſtical Senſe, Trope
or Figure (unmeet for an
Article of our Faith). But
it is a true and Orthodox
Opinion according to the
Expoſition thereof, plain
and eaſie to be underſtood
of the meaneſt Capacity.
Moreover I obſerve, that
there may be a conſiderable
uſe made thereof, thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
according to Mr.
<hi>Selden</hi>'s Opinion, to wit,
That hereby is manifeſted
the Re-union of Chriſt's
Soul unto his Body in the
Grave at or immediately
before his Reſurrection, with
the time and maner thereof,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49139:10"/>
which in no other Article of
the Creed, not yet in any plain
place of the Scripture (that I
remember) not having a
various Expoſition, is directly
averred.</p>
            <p>Now beſides the ſeveral
Texts of Scriptures produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
for proof of this Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Chriſts Deſcenſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Hell, the place of the
Damned, variouſly expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the conſtant belief and
profeſſion of the <hi>Catholick</hi>
Church for many Ages hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto,
and the Opinions
and Judgments of many of
the ancient Orthodox Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49139:10"/>
and learned and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Doctors of the Primitive
times agreeing unanimouſly
in the ſame Opinion, are
ſtrongly urged in behalf of
that Opinion, which are not
eaſily to be expunged; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
inferring, That, ſay they,
to introduce a new Opinion
of yeſterday's ſtanding into
an Article of our Faith, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
heard of before, againſt
and diſagreeing with the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Opinion of the Church
throughout all Ages hitherto
obſerved, might prove a
matter of very ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
and breed much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance
and confuſion in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49139:11"/>
the Church, not to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
of by diſcreet ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
men, but rather (with
more reaſon) for the unity
of the Church, worthy to
be exploded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer;</hi> If it were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
That ſuch an Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Chriſts Deſcenſion
into Hell, the place of the
damned, as is before ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,
were the true ſenſe and
meaning of the ſaid Article
of the Creed, there would
be no reaſon to leave that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Expoſition for a new;
but rather a neceſſity to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
to it, and acknowledge
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49139:11"/>
it as the true and proper ſenſe
of that Article; But ſuch
Interpretation being queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
dubious, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
by many other diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Opinions of learned and
pious men (though of later
times) the probability or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
only of the truth of
that former Opinion (though
never ſo ſtrongly backt by
learned, pious, and Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
Fathers and Doctors,
who may and have had their
failings) cannot bind the
Conſciences of other men
unto an implicite Faith,
but they may be at liberty to
adhere unto ſuch an Opinion
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49139:12"/>
(though lately publiſhed)
which may by the judgment
of other learned Orthodox
Chriſtians, compared with
the ſacred Scriptures, ſavour
in their apprehenſion of more
probability of the true ſenſe
of that Article, than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Opinion.</p>
            <p>It may peradventure be
likewiſe objected, That if
this Opinion of Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>'s
had been intended by the
Compoſers of the Creed, it
is likely, that the time of
ſuch deſcenſion into the
Grave, would have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
in that Article as well
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49139:12"/>
as the time in the Article of
the Reſurrection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer;</hi> The time of the
deſcenſion into Hell the
place of the damned is not
ſet down in the Article; the
knowledge whereof would
have been as neceſſary, as
of this, and which is far
more intricate to diſcover
than this is: and therefore,
if the time of the deſcenſion
had been thought material,
it is likely, it would not have
been omitted, being a point
controverted; but in this
other Expoſition, it is not ſo
requiſite to be ſet down, for
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49139:13"/>
that the punctual time of his
deſcenſion into the Grave,
is apparent to be at the very
inſtant time of the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
being both acted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
as one individual Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
in a moment of time:
For by an old Tradition, as
ſome ſay, The diviſion of
the twelve Articles of the
Creed was firſt made by the
twelve Apoſtles, every one,
ſay they, ſetting down one
ſingle Article; wherein this
Article (made, as goes the
report, by S. <hi>Thomas</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle)
<hi>Deſcendit ad Inferos, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio
die reſurrexit,</hi> containing
both the deſcenſion and the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49139:13"/>
Reſurrection, is joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in one Article; and
therefore, not improperly, it
may be thence inferred, that
as they were made at firſt
one Article joyntly, ſo the
time of the deſcenſion of
Chriſts Soul into Hell or the
Grave, and of his Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
were both at one
time; and the time of the
Reſurrection is rather men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
than of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion
into the Grave, to
fulfil the Scriptures, which
mention the time of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
but not of the
deſcenſion: yet the <hi>Lutherans</hi>
gueſs at a time when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49139:14"/>
into <hi>Hell,</hi> the place of
the damned, which was, as
they ſay, between his Burial
and Reſurrection in <hi>body</hi> and
<hi>ſoul;</hi> for they will have it to
be after his Burial, and before
his Reſurrection, that it
might concur with the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the place thereof in
the Creed, which is between
his Burial and Reſurrection:
And others think, wreſting
<hi>Pſalm 119. v.</hi> 62. to their
purpoſe, That he deſcended
thither in <hi>body</hi> and <hi>ſoul</hi> about
Midnight, and roſe again

That as there is nothing ſaid

            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:49139:20"/>
The firſt of theſe Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
is ſubdivided again,
ſome making the place to
be <hi>Hell,</hi> or the place of the
damned; and Mr. <hi>Brough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
contending againſt Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
<hi>Bilſon,</hi> That it is Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe;
and <hi>Durand</hi> interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Deſcending, only
of a virtual motion and
the efficacy of his Death, to
the Souls detained there;
and <hi>Calvin,</hi> and our <hi>Parker</hi>
from him, underſtanding by
it the torments of the
damned, affirm Chriſts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent,
to ſignifie the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them, eſpecially in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49139:20"/>
his Soul. You demanded
not of me the Reaſons of not
approving any of theſe, but
only my Opinion of that
which you call Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>'s,
and I have ſet down for the
<hi>fourth.</hi> And becauſe I ſee
no cauſe to approve of that,
it will be reaſonable, that
I point out, what I do ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
to, and upon what
grounds I prefer it before
Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>'s. That which
I adhere to, is this:</p>
            <p>That as Chriſt's Body af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his Crucifixion and
Death was diſpoſed of in
the Grave, ſo his Soul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49139:21"/>
to, and continued in
the condition or ſtate of
the Dead till the third day,
meaning hereby the very
ſame thing which I ſuppoſe
to be meant by the firſt
Opinion [<hi>that Chriſt in
his Spirit went to the place
of the Souls departed</hi>] ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting
only from the ends,
which have been variouſly
aſſigned, by ſeveral men
Ancient and Modern, for
his thus deſcending. That he
deſcended for the freeing
ſome out of Hell, hath
been the Opinion of ſome of
the Ancients; as of others,
for the opening Heaven
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49139:21"/>
to thoſe that were formerly
kept out of it, and of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
for the triumphing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Devil in his own
Quarter, and ſhewing openly
the Victory he had gotten o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Death and Hell; The laſt
of theſe I abſtain from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning,
having leſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
to it than to either of
the two former, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
have ſet it down in
the <hi>Practical Catechiſm,</hi> as
that which may piouſly be
believed: But I now deſire,
I ſay, to abſtract from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of theſe ends, and not to
fix on any other end, but
whatſhall neceſſarily and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49139:22"/>
ariſe from the
Article moſt ſimply ſet
down: and herein I ſuppoſe
I ſhall beſt comply with
the Doctrine of our Church,
Article 3. defining no
more than thus, (and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining
from what had been
expreſs'd in the Article of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the Sixth.) [That
<hi>as Chriſt dyed for us and
was buried, ſo alſo it is to
be believed that he went
down into Hell</hi>] without
any Explication: For ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
the word [<hi>Hell</hi>] in the
Article to be anſwerable to
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and that word by the

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49139:22"/>
inviſible, and that by the
aequivalent <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing,
it is to me per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
indifferent, whether
this be underſtood of a
State or a Place, ſo it be the
common place of the dead
or Souls departed, and not
any impalement of thoſe,
either to Torments or
Bliſs. Let it be taken for
the common place of Souls,
not limited either to that on
one ſide, which we call
Heaven; or what we call
Hell on the other; or
any third middle Place:
but indefinitely for the place
of Souls, <hi>i.e.</hi> of all Souls
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49139:23"/>
departed (whereſoever they
are) and then it will be
hardly intelligible, how
this differs from a State; for
Place properly ſo called it
cannot be, that Notion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to Circumſcription
or Definition; and as Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcription
is only of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
ſo Definition which is
of Souls, will not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly
attributed to an
indefinite, <hi>i. e.</hi> the common
place of Souls; but ſome
one place, be it Heaven
or Hell, or a third; and then
taking it for a place only
improperly, that is all one
with that which I call a
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49139:23"/>
State; This I ſay, becauſe
againſt the interpreting <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
for the State of the Dead,
I ſee it preſſed by a very
learned Man of our Church,
that among Heathen
Authors <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> always ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
a Place; and this evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
brought for it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they that killed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
&amp; <hi>c.</hi> and ſo were dead,
and the Souls in the ſtate
of the Dead, were yet by
the Heathens believed
not to be admitted into
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as from their Writers is
fully teſtified. But to this I
anſwer, That making no
queſtion of the truth of the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49139:24"/>
obſervation, I think it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
reconcileable with my
Notion of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> for a State;

               </gap>, which
of all others which diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
was affirmed by
them, which being equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
true and applicable, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49139:24"/>
to the Notion of a Place
or State (for I deny not
that in their Opinion the
Soul of one unburied was
in the State of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
though he were in State of

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
as I interpret that a State)
the Argument is of no force
againſt me, who mean that
very ſame thing by the
State of the Dead, which
they meant by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, when
they denyed the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
or to be admitted thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
In like manner when
they ſay that Chriſt by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
or humane rational Soul
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49139:25"/>
deſcended to <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and I,
that the Animal Soul thus
deſcended, I ſuppoſe thoſe
two to contain no real dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
(as to this matter
of the Deſcent); for I uſe
this Phraſe, becauſe it is by
the Animal Soul in proper
ſpeaking, that any one lives,
and that is common to Man
with all other Animals, and
yet in a man this is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly
called Spirit alſo
(as <hi>breath</hi> and <hi>life</hi> are all one)
<hi>mans becoming a living Soul,</hi>
being an immediate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent
of Gods <hi>breathing
into his noſtrils the breath of
life,</hi> Gen. 2. 7. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49139:25"/>
there is another No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Spirit, for the upper
Immortal Soul which paſſeth
not into the condition of
Death, but was by Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into his Father's hands
(in reſpect of which I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it was that the <hi>Thief</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
promiſe to <hi>be with him
that day in Paradiſe,</hi> the Thief's

<hi>He yielded up the Ghoſt,</hi> which
proceeds not on ſuch a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical

of theſe equally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
the force of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
lately made uſe of
by learned Mr. <hi>Pearſon</hi> (on
the <hi>Creed page</hi> 480.) to prove,
that the meaning of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49139:26"/>
is, the Motion or Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation
of Chriſts Soul to
the place of Souls. The
Argument is taken from an
oppoſition which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
made to the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
of the <hi>Apollinarians,</hi>
which conſiſted in this,
That Chriſt took on him
our humane Fleſh, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the humane Soul,
(his Deity ſupplying the
place of that:) Which Error
of theirs the Fathers refute by
this, That in his Death his
Soul was ſeparated from the
Body, in reſpect whereof he
went to <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. This Hereſie
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:49139:27"/>
of theirs equally deprived
Chriſt of the Rational Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual
and of the Animal
Soul, teaching, that his Fleſh
was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>without

and ſo the Fathers Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

by reflecting on the exact

with the Order and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture

That if this were ſuppoſed

Having given ſo full, and
as I ſuppoſe clear unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
account of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this Article, that it
belongs to Chriſts Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,
the reality and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of the Separation
of his Soul from his Body,
and its being in <hi>Hades,</hi> as
that is the place or habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or condition of ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Souls, and being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
to Souls cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
ſignifie the Grave, the
Repoſitory only of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
I need add no further
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49139:31"/>
prejudices to Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>'s
Opinion; Which firſt if this
be true, cannot be the
truth; Secondly, belongs
not to Chriſts Humiliation,
but is all one with his
Reſurrection; Thirdly, is a
Deſcent from no place, no
Aſcent being before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned;
Fourthly, is not
compatible with any ſtay
of his Soul in <hi>Hades;</hi> both
which yet the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing
that his Soul is not
forſaken and left there, muſt
import, and the ſubſequent
mention in the Creed of the
third days riſing intimates
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49139:32"/>
the third day, the Stay, the
Riſing, the Humiliation:
Fifthly, Is founded in <hi>Hades,</hi>
ſignifying the Grave or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitory
of the Body, which
generally and by the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
of the Word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to the Habitation of
Souls, and is uſed in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
ſometimes, where it
cannot be meant of the
Grave, as Gen. 37. 35. <hi>I
will go down to the Grave,</hi> (we
render,) <hi>to my Son mourning,</hi>
ſpoken of <hi>Jacob</hi> in relation
to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> whom yet he
believed torn in pieces with
wild Beaſts and not at all
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49139:32"/>
interred. Sixthly, if this be
not ſufficient, then remember
that it was <hi>God,</hi> Rom. 4. 24.
Acts 3. 26. the <hi>Spirit,</hi> that is,
<hi>Divine Spirit,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 18.
Rom. 8. 11. <hi>that raiſed up
Jeſus from the Dead,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it may not be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to his Animal or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Soul going down into
the Grave and fetching out
the Body; at leaſt thus it
cannot be in the place of
the <hi>Pſalmiſt;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 16. 10.</note> for there it is
equally attributed to God,
<hi>that he ſhall not leave his Soul
in Hell, and not ſuffer him</hi> (in
reſpect of his Body) <hi>to ſee
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49139:33"/>
corruption:</hi> Which muſt
therefore unqueſtionably be
underſtood, Firſt, of Gods
doing the whole Work in
General; Secondly, in Gods
reſcuing the Soul from <hi>Hades,</hi>
in which he was detained
(and preſerving the Body
from corruption to which it
was lyable.) Which is quite
contrary to Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>'s
Interpretation, which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
the Soul not to be at
all detained there, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
not the Patient but
the Agent in the Reſcue,
when 'tis evident that God
is the Agent, equally in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49139:33"/>
reſpect both of Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and the Soul as the
Body, the Patient, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the
Paſſive. Seventhly, one Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
more I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to you againſt this
Senſe; The <hi>Aquileian Creed</hi>
is obſerved to have been the
firſt in which this Article
is expreſt, and in this there
was no mention of Chriſts
Burial; the ſame is viſible in
that which we call the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſian:</hi>
Now though
from hence I conclude not
(as ſome have done) that
it is all one with Burial
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49139:34"/>
(for it may be Burial, and
ſomewhat more, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
of the Soul as well
as the Body, during the ſpace
of Separation) yet ſure
this may I conclude, That
it cannot with any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
refer to the Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
him out of the
Grave (as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>'s
phancy imports) when there
had no mention of His being
there, preceded: For what
tolerable Senſe would there
be in the words of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quileian
Creed</hi> thus under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood?
The words of that
are, <hi>Crucifixus ſub Pontio Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lato,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49139:34"/>
deſcendit in Inferna,</hi>
which Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> may have
thus interpreted, <hi>Being Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
under</hi> Pontius Pilate,
<hi>his Soul went into the
Grave to raiſe his Body
thence:</hi> This I ſay were
abſurd; without mention
or intimation firſt given
of his Body being at all
there. So in the <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian,
He ſuffered for our
Salvation, deſcended into
Hell, roſe again the third
day from the Dead;</hi> where
there is mention of no
more, but of his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but neither of his
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49139:35"/>
               <hi>Death</hi> or <hi>Burial</hi> (if de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending
to <hi>Hades</hi> ſignifie
them not) with what
propriety could it be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
immediately, that he
went down into the Grave
to raiſe the Body thence?
If theſe Arguments, any or
all, prevail with you, to
reject this Interpretation,
I need add no more; if
they do not, I ſhall then
recommend one thing more
to your conſideration,
That ſome Opinions are
ſo remote and improbable,
that it is hard to produce
any Argument to make
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49139:35"/>
them more ſo, than of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
they are, and this
is fit to be in front of
ſuch; That of <hi>Ramus,</hi>
that Burying doth not ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
Burying but Embalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(that ſo deſcending
to <hi>Hades</hi> may be left to
ſignifie Burial) being
though not more true, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
more ingenious and
probable than this; and
yet againſt this, it will be
hard to produce above one
Argument, (and that with
him a begging the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which among <hi>Logici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
goes for the moſt
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49139:36"/>
fallacious way of Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting)
<hi>viz,</hi> that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
all Authors, Sacred
and Prophane, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
Burial not Embalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Having ſaid thus much
to the Main, I ſhall now
review your Letter, and
give it what reflexions
ſeem yet to be needful:
And Firſt, When you
think it is an inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
that the Opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>'s is preſt
with, to acknowledge in
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49139:36"/>
the Text, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 16. 10.
That Chriſt was left in
Hell the place of the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
though for no long
time; you now ſee, Firſt,
that Hell (ſignifying not
definitely the place of the
Damned, any more than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
Heaven the place
of the Glorified; but inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely,
the common Place,
Habitation, Condition of
the Dead, Chriſt being there
ſome time, and the third
day recalled thence) is not
his being left in <hi>Hades,</hi>
but the quite contrary to
it, his being reſcued thence
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49139:37"/>
timely, which yet he could
not properly be, if he were
not there for ſome time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
The Phraſe which from the
<hi>Pſalm</hi> the Apoſtle uſeth, <hi>Acts</hi>
2. 27. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Thou
ſhalt not ſo leave, as to
forſake deſtitute. But then
Secondly, It is moſt certain,
that Chriſts Divinity was
inſeparably united both to
the Soul and Body of
Chriſt, and ſo according to
your hearts deſire, though
Chriſts Soul were (as my
Opinion holds) in <hi>Hades,</hi>
State or place of the
Dead, for ſome ſpace, yet
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49139:37"/>
God left it not, forſook it
not there one minute.
Next, when you ſay,
There is a conſiderable uſe
of this Opinion, the manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Re-union of Chriſt's
Body and Soul in the
Grave, with the time and
manner thereof, at, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
before his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
which you ſay
is in no other Article, nor
in any plain place of
Scripture averred. To
this I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Firſt, That
as a ſuppoſed incommodity
doth not ſolve, ſo a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
advantage doth not
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49139:38"/>
competently found an
Argument; Secondly, That
your own confeſſion, That
there is no plain place of
Scripture that averrs this,
is a valid Argument of
probation, that it ought
not to be eſteemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
part of our Faith, nor
conſequently, any Article
of our Creed; Thirdly,
That when in the Creed
[whatſoever may be ſaid
of the Scripture] the
Separation of his Body and
Soul, together with the
time and manner of it,
is no otherwiſe ſet down,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49139:38"/>
than by his being affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be dead; ſo is there
no kind of need, that
the Re-union ſhould be
more particularly ſet down,
than by teaching us, <hi>that
the third day he roſe again,</hi>
it being certain that he
is the whole Chriſt that
dyed, and ſo both Soul
and Body, and ſo the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
that he roſe again
is perfectly aequivalent and
tantamount to his Soul
being re-united to his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
Then for the time,
that is alſo mentioned in
that Article, <hi>the third day;</hi>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:49139:39"/>
as for the manner, this
Interpretation ſets not that
down truly, as was ſaid;
For the Reſurrection of
the Body was the work of
his Divinity, and not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly
of his Animal or
Human Soul, but as of the
Inſtrument uſed by his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
Next when you propoſe
an Objection in behalf of
the Opinion of the Deſcent
into the place of the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and give anſwer to it,
I ſhall thus far interpoſe;
Firſt, that the Authority of
the Antient Church in a
matter of this moment, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:49139:39"/>
on what was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
by the Apoſtles to
the Churches, is, and ought
to be of great weight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all novel Heterodox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
ſo far as thoſe of the
Antient Church agree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themſelves: Now
though as to the end of
Chriſts deſcending, and to
the Definition of the Place,
the Antients conſent not,
but differ very much from
one another (which is
ſhewed at large by Mr. <hi>Pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>) <note place="margin">Mr. Pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, page 479.</note>
and therefore in theſe
particulars our Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
not, yet there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49139:40"/>
they more uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
agree in, than that the
Soul of Chriſt really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
into the habitation
of Souls; for which I like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
for brevity ſake re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr
you to Mr. <hi>Pearſon,
page</hi> 479. And therefore
thus far we ought in all
reaſon to come up to them,
which he cannot, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>'s
Opinion, interprets <hi>Hades</hi>
of the Grave, the Repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory
of the Body only.
Laſtly, For the Old Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
that mentions the
Deſcent and Reſurrection
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49139:40"/>
together, as one Article
compoſed by Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi>
there is little heed to be
given to that Tradition, or
indeed to the foundation
of it, that every Apoſtle
caſt in his particular ſhott:
For firſt it will be hard to
deduce the Creed in the
very form we have it, from
the Apoſtles immediately,
it being ſo variouſly ſet
down, in the firſt times,
and the Article of the
Deſcent omitted in many;
and the <hi>Aquileian</hi> being
the firſt which delivers it in
our preſent form: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49139:41"/>
'Tis moſt certain, that
every Apoſtle preached
the whole Faith, and at
their parting from <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
agreed in common upon
a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, form
of wholſom words, not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
to writing, or obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
it to the very ſame
words, and this was called
their <hi>Symbolum,</hi> as that ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
a <hi>teſſera militaris,</hi> by
which Chriſtians were
known from others; and
not from the notion of a
Shott which belongs to
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> rather than <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>;
ſo that you are not to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49139:41"/>
think that old Tradition,
which in reſpect of true
Antiquity, is but a novel
Fable of no authority, and
founded in a manifeſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake,
will be fit to aſſiſt
Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>'s, or any other
Conceit.</p>
