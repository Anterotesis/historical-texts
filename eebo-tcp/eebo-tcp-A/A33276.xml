         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

By whoſe errataes, Right Honourable, I hope the Lord will teach you to beware, and by giving you a clear diſcerning of his mind, and will in theſe more bright ſunne-ſhining daies (wherein the Earth begins to be filled with the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the Sea) will give you to underſtand that as all power in earth is given to him, ſo he to the glory of God his Father, whoſe power, and wiſdome he is, doth wiſely manage the ſame by a two fold adminiſtration of power ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the two fold ſtate or being of man, whom in the earth, and in the things thereof he hath appointed Lord; that one may be called an earthly, and outward adminiſtration, which ſuits the outward man, and all thoſe outward, and viſible things (in reference unto man)
<pb facs="tcp:56389:3"/>
that do belong thereto, as he is Lord thereof, and is managed by an outward viſible ſword of ſteel, and by a carnall or audible voyce, or word of him, or them that holds it in their hand, and to an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and carnal end, (yet righteous, juſt, and good, which being diligently attended to tends to the peace, liberty, and proſperity of a civil State, Nation and Kingdom ſo far as it concerns the outward man and viſible ſtate thereof;) which end is the preſervation of it ſelf, the whole, and every particular part, and perſon, belonging thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, ſafe in their perſon, name, and eſtate from him, or them that would riſe up viſibly to oppreſs, or wrong them in the ſame; Thus in the general; and to inſtance more particularly, in caſe by the cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a wholeſome Law, and juſt penalty annexed thereunto, which by a carnall hand or way, is preſented to a carnall and viſible eye, or ear, the Oppreſſour takes not warning, and will not be deterred from offering violence to the perſon, name, or eſtate of his neighbour, then by this power ſhall he be made reſponſible, and be forced <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens volens,</hi> ſo far as he is able to make it good, and to reſtore; in caſe any be impoveriſhed, or faln to decay in their outward man, and eſtates by age, ſickneſs, fire, or by ſome other way, or hand of GOD; ſo far as their preſent ſtrength extends, by this power they are to be employed, and where it fails, to be relieved, and that by an equall, and juſt levy of their neigbours eſtates to be taken alſo by force in caſe there be not ſo much love, and charity in them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their poor diſtreſſed neighbours to conſtrain them thereunto, and by the ſame way alſo to maintain itſelf, and all other juſt undertakings that may be preſented for the preſervation of the whole. And this in brief is the ſum of that adminiſtration of Chriſts power in earth ſo far as it meerly concerns the outward man with reſpect to others that may up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it, or moleſt it, and is managed by that ſword of ſteel which in reference unto him is called in ſcripture the rod of iron by which he rules the nations, and breaks them to peeces like a Potters veſſel; and with this adminiſtration of his power on Earth (Right Honourable) hath he (who is the Lord of Lords and ſhall ere long appear as King and Judge of all) betruſted you in theſe three Nations, having as a manifeſt token thereof put into your hand that iron rod, and to admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath ſtrengthened and upheld your arm for the ſubduing, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56389:4"/>There is yet beſides this, another adminiſtration of Chriſts power on Earth, which compared with this, may be truly termed heavenly and ſpirituall, it being that which ſuiteth with, and principally is exerciſed about the ſpirituall, or hidden part of man, to wit, his ſpirit, mind, and conſcience, which is indeed the moſt naturall Lord and commander of the outward, it and all things belonging thereunto being but naturally ſubject, and readily obedient, from which very conſideration it is, that it is more ſafe, and alſo more honourable, for the powers on earth to have one thouſand ſouls to be ſubject to them for love and conſcience ſake, than to have ten thouſand times ten thouſand bodies ſeemingly ſubject, for wrath ſake, and for fear of revenge; this ſpirit and great commander in man, is ſuch a ſparkling beam, from the Father of lights, and ſpirits, that it cannot be lorded over, commanded, or forced, either by men, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, or angels, but onely leaving its firſt ſtation, wherein it came ſo neer to the light and glory of God, it is now cauſed to poſſeſs death and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and by that means is in a capacity by men and devils to be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and ſo by perſwaſion to be mis-led. This ſpirituall adminiſtration of Chriſts power in and over the ſpirits and conſciences of men, as it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to all the inward and hidden motions and actings of the mind, ſo to all the outward manifeſtations of its powerfull commands in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, in reference unto God, and eſpecially unto ſuch as appertain to the viſible worſhip and ſervice of God, who hath declared himſelf to be a Spirit, and will be worſhipped in ſpirit and in truth, and ſeeks ſuch, and onely ſuch to worſhip him: This ſpirituall adminiſtration ſo far as it concerns the outward man, is managed not by a ſword of Steel (which cannot come neer or touch the ſpirit or mind of man) but by the ſword that proceeds out of the mouth of his ſervants, the word of truth, and eſpecially as to the efficacy, and to the inward man, by the two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edged ſword of the Spirit, that ſpirituall law and light with which theſe candles of the Lord are enlightned, and that by himſelf, who is that light <hi>that enlightneth every man that comes into the world;</hi> and this ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all adminiſtration of Chriſts power on earth in and over the ſpirits, minds, and conſciences of the ſons of men, and alſo over the outward man as to worſhip meerly, is committed into the hands of the Spirit of Chriſt, who is his <hi>vice-roy</hi> here on earth, and is only able to deal with ſpirits by way of convincing, converting, transforming, and as it were a-new creating of them, and ſo to tranſlate them out of the Kingdome of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in which they are by nature, into the glorious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

the ſpirits, and ſpirituall ſtrong holds of men and devils, and by them to convict, avenge, and execute the ſentence written, which upon ſuch as manifeſt the emnity that is in their minds in the higheſt degree even againſt the holy Spirit himſelf (the only ſin unpardonable (for all other ſin and blaſphemy ſhall be forgiven) I ſay the written ſentence that is to be executed upon ſuch) is <hi>anathema maranatha,</hi> that is, accurſed with this intimation, <hi>our Lord cometh,</hi> leaving them untill he meet with them; and otherwiſe than thus the ſervants of Chriſt cannot proceed, having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs command not to ſtrive, but to be <hi>patient, apt to teach,</hi> in meekneſs inſtructing thoſe that oppoſe themſelves, &amp; to wait if God at anytime wil give them repentance to the acknowledgement of the truth: Thus if it pleaſe the Father of lights to give you (Right Honorable) to diſtinguiſh between theſe two adminiſtrations of Chriſt's power here on earth, and to leave that part to himſelf in the hand of his Spirit, which cannot be conferred on others, nor yet rightly managed but by the <hi>two-edged ſword of that Spirit,</hi> and wholly give up your ſelves to improve that part which belongs unto, and well ſuits with that ſword which you are now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with, it will much conduce to his glory, your own praiſe, and the peace and ſettlement of theſe three Nations, over which the Lord hath ſet you.</p>
            <p>And whereas Right Honorable, it is in your hearts, to propagate the Goſpell of Jeſus Chriſt; the thing is excellent that is in your hearts, and I hope the way to effect it is before you, which is, ſith the Lord of hoaſts hath ſaid, that works of this nature are carried on, <hi>not by might, nor by power, but by his Spirit,</hi> therefore to give way to his Spirit for the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting thereof: and to this end I humbly propoſe, that your way to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this glorious deſign, as to the might and power this Lord of Hoaſts hath betruſted you with, is</p>

diſſemble ſeeing the Lord is at hand) is falſe, and evil, not the order of the Goſpel of Chriſt as you pretend, and therefore diſorder, confuſion, and that, which in Scripture language is called Babel; And ſecondly to bear teſtimony, or witneſs againſt that way by which you maintain it, which being chiefly as it appears by carnal weapons, which cannot reach to the heart or ſpirit of a man, which is the principal part, and upon the point the whole in the worſhip of God, without which there is no acceptance with him, this I ſay muſt needs alſo be falſ, but yet far worſe, it being no way appointed, or approved of Chriſt, nor yet groundedly expected or practiſed by Chriſtians who firſt truſted in Chriſt, and therefore upon due examination will prove moſt unchriſtian, yea Antichriſtian; I ſhall uſe but theſe two arguments in this place to convince you, The firſt wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſtandeth thus.</p>
            <p>That order, and way to maintain it which neither hath precept from Chriſt, and his Apoſtles in his laſt will and teſtament, nor yet preſident, or example a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe that firſt truſted in Chriſt, that order cannot be the order of the Goſpel of Chriſt, nor that way his way to maintain it.</p>
            <p>But the order which you call the order of the Goſpel of Chriſt, and the way which you ſay is his way to maintain it, hath neither precept, nor preſident in his laſt will and teſtament.</p>
            <p>The firſt propoſition I ſuppoſe none of you can deny, unleſs you can find a later than that which is called his laſt will and teſtament, and as for the ſecond the truth thereof, will as eaſily appear if you bring your order, and way to maintain it to the precept of Chriſt, and practiſe of thoſe that firſt truſted in him; and firſt for your order, what precept from Chriſt, or practiſe among thoſe that firſt truſted in him have you for baptizing of infants (who are declared to be but fleſh and by nature the Children of wrath one as well as another:) for rantiſing and ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them, and not baptizing or dipping them; for accepting ſuch as were ſprinkled with ſuperſtitious hallowed water, and by the hand of as ſuperſtitious conſecrated a miniſtery of Antichriſt, and for receiving of ſuch as are ſprinkled by your ſelves to the ordinance of baptiſm as you call it, but yet to deny them communion in the Apoſtles doctrine, and in breaking of bread: And if you cannot find either precept from Chriſt or his Apoſtles, or example among thoſe that firſt truſted in Chriſt for none of theſe, then will you be a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And touching your way to maintain it, what have you a precept and preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the laſt will and teſtiment of Chriſt for ſuch a gathering together with reſpect to the order of the Goſpell of Chriſt in the name, and by the leave of the Magiſtrate, ſo as to make it a thing unlawful for the ſervants of Chriſt to do it, without him, by the civil ſword to correct errour, hereſies, and all falſe worſhips, to conſtrain all Church-members, and ſuch alſo as are without (and ſo cannot but by you be looked upon to be without faith, without which it is impoſſible to pleaſe God) outwardly and hypocritically to conform to your worſhip, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them in like manner outwardly and hypocritically from enjoying their own, when according to that rule (to which is annexed the promiſe of peace to ſuch as walk thereby) the greateſt Apoſtacies and Blaſphemies (that unpardonable fin it ſelf not excepted) were but puniſhed with a delivery of the perſon that was guilty thereof unto Satan the God of this world, that he might learn not to blaſpheme the God of heaven, and ſo to leave him to the coming of the Lord who ſhall come in flaming fire to render vengeance upon ſuch; and ſo much is
<pb facs="tcp:56389:6"/>
ſignified by the word <hi>anathema Maranatha.</hi> And I pray conſider whether this be not to place the Magiſtrate too high, or too low; too high in caſe you make him the chief, and upon the point the only Judge in ſpiritual things (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And ſo I have done with the firſt argument; the ſecond ſtands thus.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Arg.</hi> That order, and way to maintain it which is not only different from, but contrary unto the precept of Chriſt in his laſt will and teſtament, and the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of Chriſtians that firſt truſted in him, that order cannot be the order of the Goſpel of Chriſt, nor that way his way to maintain it. But the order which you call the order of the Goſpel of Chriſt, and the way which you ſay is his way to maintain it, is not only different from but contrary unto the precept of Chriſt, and the practiſe of Chriſtians that firſt truſted in him.</p>
            <p>The firſt propoſition it undeniable, and the ſecond will eaſily appear to be true if your order<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that way by which you ſeek to maintain it be brought to and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the precept of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, and the example of thoſe churches that firſt truſted in him; and firſt compare but your order with either precept, or preſident; and it will evidently appear not only to be differing from, but contrary unto the order of the Goſpel of Chriſt: for according to the precept of Chriſt every creature to whom the Goſpel was to be preached was by the preaching thereof to be made a diſciple before he was to be baptiſed, and then being ſo made, and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized he was to be taught to obſerve all things which Chriſt had commanded, which was in reference to a ſober, righteous, and godly converſation in the order of his houſe, according to which precept was the practiſe of thoſe that firſt truſted in him, for they, and they only that gladly received the word of ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt were baptized, <hi>Acts</hi> 2 and they, and all they that were baptized were joined with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leave of the Magiſtrate, and continued together ſteadfaſtly in the Apoſtles doctrine; and in fellowſhip, and breaking of bread and prayer: but your joining toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not at the command of the Lord, but by the leave of the Magiſtrate, and your continuing together in imitation of the firſt Churches, and appointing a miniſtery before your ſelves be baptized, and ſo viſibly planted into the death of Chriſt as they were; and your adminiſtring baptiſm (as you call it) to ſuch as are not the true ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects thereof before they are taught, or made diſciples; and after a falſe manner, viz. by ſprinkling, which no way reſembles the death, burial, or reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, being that which his baptiſme is appointed to do; and your admitting ſome unto baptiſm (as you own it) which you refuſe to admit unto breaking of bread, and your receiving ſuch to breaking of bread, which yet were never baptized with the baptiſm appointed by Jeſus Chriſt the Lord; and your ſhutting out the exerciſe of the gift of prophecying, which in the Church of Chriſt doth admirably tend to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification; and your introducing a mixt confuſed way of ſinging which fills the ear rather with a loud ſound of words, than the heart with any thing that is truly edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, all which is not only differing from, but contrary unto both precept, and preſident, and ſo cannot be the order of the Goſpel of Chriſt, and therefore is no better than diſorder, confuſion, and a part of that which in Scripture language is called Babell. And compare that way by which you maintain it, either with the precept of Chriſt or with the preſident of primitive Chriſtians and it will as evidently
<pb facs="tcp:56389:7"/>
appear not only to be different from, but contrary unto them both; for firſt the precept of Chriſt was to learn of him who was meek and lowly, and to expect trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and perſecution from others, and not to perſecute, neither to force the Jews that would not follow him, nor yet to fire the Samaritans that would not receive him, yea he expreſſely commands his Servants to let the rares alone with the wheat, and ſuffers no ſmall inconvenience thereby to avoid a greater, and further declares that the ſervant of the lord muſt nor ſtrive, but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach (not to ſtrike) patient, in meekneſs inſtructing thoſe that oppoſe themſelves, if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledgement of the truth that they may recover themſelves out of the ſnare of the devil who are taken captive by him at his will; according to which precepts of Chriſt we find the primitive Chriſtians were meek, and gentle, and yet able by ſound doctrine both to exhort, &amp; convince the gainſayers, who called not for carnall weapons to mannage their war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, but declared their weapons were mighty through God, and either by the word and a good converſation wonne men to the acknowledgement of the truth as it is in Jeſus, or elſe left them wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hout excuſe together with the world, unto the judgement of the great day of the Lord; but now all men may ſee that your way is not only dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from, but contrary unto this precept of Chriſt and preſident of Chriſtians, and therefore cannot be eſteemed any better than unchriſtian, yet Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</p>
            <p>Let not your adverſary and mine (Dear Countreymen) fill your hearts with indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and thoughts of revenge againſt him, who in a faithful diſcharge of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience both towards God, and you, have made bold to deal plainly with you, leaſt my God to whom vengeance belongs, repay it upon you, and ſmite you with blindneſs of mind, and hardneſs of heart that cannot repent, but rather ſet before your eyes that memorable practice, and worthy pattern of thoſe noble Bereans, and (laying profits, honor and prejudice aſide if it be poſſible) peruſe my teſtimony, and ſearch the ſcriptures diligently to ſee whether the things contained therein be ſo or no; if you find them ſo, viz. confirmed, and juſtifyed by the word of God, and by the teſtimony of Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, then conſider, not I but the Lord from heaven calls upon you to break off your ſins by repentance, and let me hereby give you warning to take heed that you diſpiſe not him that ſpeaketh from heaven. As touching the wrong and injury done to us, you having thereby much more wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your own ſouls in tranſgreſſing the very law, and light of Nations, doing as you would not be done unto, it is in my heart to pitty you rather, and to petition my Lord in heaven not to lay this ſin to your charge, than to complain againſt you, or to petition your lords and ours here on earth for juſtice herein; no, no, we have better learned Chriſt than ſo, having alſo given up our hearts to be led by his ſpirit; and to walk in his ſteps, who when he was reviled, reviled not again, when he ſuffered, he threatned not, but committed his caſe to him that judgeth righteouſly, and who knowes but that the ſpirit of judgement, and the ſpirit of burning, hath been, or may be ere long in your hearts, whereby you may be made af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectedly ſenſible, that the cauſe is the ſame, or very little differing from this.</p>
            <p>A poor innocent traveller paſſeth along the Countrey upon his occaſions: a man having ſtrength in his arm findeth him, frames himſelf offended with him for no cauſe he hath given him, and becauſe he cannot draw him unto his party, either to rob, or to kill, or to ſay amen to his practiſes, he therefore binds him, and caſts him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a pit, and declares himſelf reſolute there to keep him, till he hath his blood, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he will deliver him his purſe; the man either hath not a purſe about him, or a heart to deliver it; and being unwilling either to part with his blood, or that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould be ſo deeply guilty in taking it from him, he meekly, and earneſtly
<pb facs="tcp:56389:7"/>
thrice moveth the ſtrong man for a diſcourſe, and humbly entreats him that he would not ſeek by the ſtrength of his arme, but by the force of ſome arguments to convince his underſtanding, and conſcience, and ſo to draw him (as a man) to his party, but the ſtrong man delaies him, and ſo puts him off; whereupon a good tender hearted Samaritan paſſing by, and perceiving how the caſe ſtood, and that the ſtrong man would have his purſe; or his blood without any diſpute, being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with compaſſion to redeem this innocent blood from the handof the ſtrong man he delivers him his own purſe, and ſo the man is releaſed. Take it not ill that I have uſed ſo much plaineſs of ſpeech, for my ſtudie is now to ſpeak plainly, and neither flatteringly nor invectively: and to uſe plain dealing with all men, although I verifie the Proverb, and die a begger; for as I told ſome of your ſelve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

for as immediately before Christs appearing in fleſh, Satan in a large meaſure poſſeſſed the bodies of men, that by his caſting them out, his power in fleſh might appear; So before his coming again in glory I have grounds to expect that the minds &amp; ſpirits of men ſhall be ſtrongly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed; and that as this fundamentall concluſion, Thou art Jeſus the ſon of the living God, ſhall be improved to the utmoſt by the holy Spirit of Chriſt in the hearts and lives of the ſons and daughters of God, ſo ſhall the ſame concluſion be improved to the utmost by way of a bewitching deception in the hearts and lives of the ſons of men by the ſpirit of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, which myſtery being brought to the height, then ſhall Chriſt Jeſus conſume him with the ſpirit of his mouth, and ſhall destroy him with the brightneſs of his coming.

               <p>A brief diſcourſe touching <hi>New England,</hi> as to the matter in hand, and to that part of it, <hi>ſci. Rode Iland,</hi> where my reſidence is, together with the occaſion of my going out with others from the <hi>Mathatuſets</hi> Bay, and the many providentiall occurrences that directed us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and pitched us thereon.</p>
               <p>As alſo the Contents of the whole Treatiſe.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>NEw England is a name (as is generally known) that was, and ſtill is, call'd upon that place in reference to Old; yet not ſo much becauſe it is peopled, and planted from thence, for ſo are many other Plantations of the Engliſh in thoſe Weſtern parts; but becauſe it reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the ſame, as the daughter the mother. It reſembles it in the climate, in the times and ſeaſons of the year, in the fruits which the land natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly produceth, in the fouls, and the fiſh that are there in abundance. It
<pb facs="tcp:56389:10"/>
reſembles it in their politicall affairs; for their governments, laws, Courts, Officers, are in a great meaſure the ſame, and ſo are the names of their towns, &amp; Counties; and in point of good husbandry, that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is raiſed and produced in New England, more ſubſtantiall, and whether it be for food or raiment it is the ſame with that which is here produced in Old. It is a place (in the largeſt acceptation) that contains in it all the Plantations of the Engliſh upon that coaſt of America that lie between the Dutch Plantation on the Weſt, and the French on the Eaſt, and extends it ſelf upon the Sea coaſt above one hundred leagues. In it is contained the four Colonies, which call themſelves the united Colonies. The Colony called by the name of the Province of Providence Plantations, lying on the South &amp; South-Eaſt thereof, and two or three more lving on the Eaſter North-Eaſt, in Agamenticus, Saco, Caſco-Bay, &amp; Pema juid, where is that treaſure of Maſts for Ships. The names of the united Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies are theſe, in point of precedency firſt Mathatuſets, &amp;c. but in point of antiquity firſt Plymouth, then the Mathatuſets, then Conectecot, and laſt Quinipiuck. The chief Towns of theſe Colonies, and ſeats of their Government are theſe, Boſton of the Mathatuſets, Plymouth of Plymouth, Hereford of Conectecot, and of Quinipiuck New-Haven.</p>
            <p>Now as the name New England in the largeſt and trueſt acceptation extends to all the Plantations of the Engliſh between the French and the Dutch, ſo in a ſcanty and improper acceptance of the word (eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when it makes for advantage) it is taken for theſe four united Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, by reaſon of the precedency they have of others, and for the ſame cauſe, and upon the point as well, it may be taken for the Mathatuſets and the Town of Boſton therein. When I ſpeak of New England, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it of that part which hath got the precedency (by reaſon of ſhipping) and ſtart of the reſt, ſci. the Mathatuſets, as both in my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle and Narrative is plain to be ſeen, which I have here alſo inſerted for fear of miſtake.</p>
            <p>In the Colony of Providence Plantations in point of antiquity the Town of Providence is chief, but in point of precedency Rode-Iland excels. This Iland lieth in the Narraganſet Bay, being 14 or 15 miles long, and in breadth between 4 and 5 miles at the broadeſt; It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be planted by the Engliſh in the beginning of the year 39. and by this hand of providence. In the year 37 I left my native land, and in the ninth moneth of the ſame, I (through mercy) arived at Boston, I was no ſooner on ſhore, but there appeared to me differences among them touching the Covenants, and in point of evidencing a mans good eſtate,
<pb facs="tcp:56389:10"/>
ſome preſt hard for the Covenant of works, and for ſanctification to be the firſt and chief evidence, others preſt as hard for the Covenant of grace that was eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes, and for the evidence of the Spirit, as that which is a more certain, conſtant, and ſatisfactory witneſs. I thought it not ſtrange to ſee men differ about matters of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, for I expect no leſs upon Earth: But to ſee that they were not able ſo to bear each with other in their different underſtandings and conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as in thoſe utmoſt parts of the World to live peaceably together, whereupon I moved the latter, for as much as the land was before us and wide enough, with the profer of Abraham to Lot, and for peace ſake, to turn aſide to the right hand, or to the left: The motion was readily accepted, and I was requeſted w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> ſome others to ſeek out a place, which accordingly I was ready to do; and thereupon by reaſon of the ſuffocating heat of the Summer before, I went to the North to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what cooler, but the Winter following proved ſo cold, that we were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Spring to make towards the South; ſo having ſought the Lord for direction, we all agreed that while our veſſell was paſſing about a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large and dangerous Cape, we would croſs over by laad, having Long Iland and Delaware-Bay in our eie for the place of our reſidence; ſo to a town called Providence we came, which was begun by one M. Roger Williams (who for matter of conſcience had not long before been exiled from the former juriſdiction) by whom we were courteouſly and lovingly received, and with whom we adviſed about our deſign; he readily preſented two places before us in the ſame Naraganſets Bay, the one upon the main called Sow-wames, the other called then Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quedneck, now Rode-Iland; we enquired whether they would fall in any other Patent, for our reſolution was to go out of them all; he told us (to be brief) that the way to know that, was to have recourſe unto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Plymouth; ſo our Veſſell as yet not being come about, and we thus blockt up, the company determined to ſend to Plymonth, and pitcht upon two others together with my ſelf, requeſting alſo M. Williams to go to Plymouth to know how the caſe ſtood; ſo we did; and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates thereof very lovingly gave us a meeting; I then informed them of the cauſe of our coming unto them, and deſired them in a word of truth and faithfulneſs to inform us whether Sow-wames were within their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, for we were now on the wing, and were reſolved through the help of Chriſt, to get cleer of all, and be of our ſelves, and provided our way were cleer before us, it were all one for us to go further off, as to remain
<pb facs="tcp:56389:11"/>
neer ac hand; their anſwer was, that Sow-wames was the garden of their Patent, and the flour in the garden then I told them we could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it; but requeſted further in the like word of truth and faithfulneſs to be informed, whether they laid claim to the Ilands in the Naraganſet Bay, and that in particular called Acquedneck? they all with a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full countenanre made us this anſwer, it was in their thoughts to have adviſed us thereto, and if the provident hand of God ſhould pitch us thereon they ſhould look upon us as free, and as loving neighbours and friends ſhould be aſſiſtant unto us upon the main, &amp;c. So we humbly thanked them, and returned with that anſwer: So it pleaſed the Lord, by moving the hearts of the natives, even the chiefeſt thereof, to pitch us thereon, and by other occurrences of providence, which are too large here to relate: So that having bought them off to their full ſatisfaction, we have poſſeſſed the place ever ſince; and notwithſtanding the different underſtandings and conſciences amongſt us, without-interruption we agree to maintain civil Juſtice and judgement, neither are there ſuch out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages committed mongſt us as in other parts of the Country are frequently ſeen.</p>

were Baptized before, and thereby did neceſſarily deny the Baptiſm that was before to be Baptiſm, the Churches no Churches, and alſo all other Ordinances, and Miniſters, as if all were a Nullity; And alſo did in the Court deny the lawfullneſs of Baptizing of infants, and all this tends to the diſhonour of God, the deſpiſing the ordinances of God among us, the peace of the Churches, and ſeducing the Subjects of this Commonwealth from the truth of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, and perverting the ſtrait waies of the Lord, therefore the Court doth fine you 20 pounds to be paid, or ſufficient ſureties that the ſaid ſum ſhall be paid by the firſt day of the next Court of Aſſiſtants, or elſe to be well whipt, and that you ſhall remain in Priſon till it be paid, or ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty given in for it.</p>

I told him that which I was to ſpeak was in reference unto a promiſe that was made us by Mr. <hi>Bridges</hi> when we were firſt apprehended, and brought before him; then ſaid the Governour ſpeak on; When we were at firſt apprehended and brought before Mr. <hi>Bridges</hi> (ſaid I) I ſaid unto him we are Strangers, and Strangers to your Laws, and may be tranſgreſſors of them before we are aware, we would therefore deſire this curteſy of you as Strangers, that you would ſhew us the Law by which we are tranſgreſſors: But then no other anſwer could we have from him than this, when you come to the Court you ſhall know the Law; now we have been before the Court in the forenoon upon examination, this afternoon we have heard our Sentence read, yet have we not heard the Law produced by which we are condemned; we therefore now deſire to ſee the Law in which our Sentence may be read, and the rather, becauſe we find in the beginning of your Laws this proviſion for the ſecurity of your own, and we hope you are not leſs regardfull of ſtrangers, <hi>viz.</hi> That no man ſhall be moleſted, but by a Law made by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Court, and lawfully publiſhed; or in defect of a Law in a particular caſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the Word of God.

but none were able to turn to the Law of God or Man by which we were condemned. At length the Governour ſtept up, and told us we had denyed Infants Baptiſm, and being ſomewhat tranſported broke forth, and told me I had deſerved death, and ſaid, he would not have ſuch traſh brought into their juriſdiction; moreover he ſaid, you go up and down, and ſecretly infinuate into thoſe that are weak, but you cannot maintain it before our Miniſters, you may try, and diſcourſe or diſpute with them, &amp;c.

            <p>It was preſented on the ſixth day, and after much ado up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the laſt day it was concluded it ſhould be granted, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation ſhould be upon the fifth day following, and ſo by one of the Magiſtrates information was given me in priſon; upon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day when their Elders were come together, there was no ſmall ſtir (as I heard) about the buſineſſe, and afterward about the ſtating of the Queſtion we ſhould diſpute upon; whereupon in the cloſure
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56389:15"/>
of the day the Magiſtrates commanded the Iaylor to bring me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them into the Chamber, which when he had done, they drew forth the motion, and ſhewing it to me, asked me if I owned that paper, I anſwered, yea, they quaeried further, whether I was of the ſame mind touching a diſputation, I told them I had not the leaſt reluctancy in my mind touching the thing, provided my motion might be granted, and the grant ſubſcribed with the Secretaries hand as an act of the ſame Court by which I was condemned; they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that was but reaſonable, &amp;c. Then they demanded of me what the queſtion was that I would diſpute upon, whether I would diſpute upon the things contained in my Sentence, and maintain my practice, for, ſaid they, the Court Sentenced you not for your judgement or Conſcience, but for matter of fact, and practice; to which I replyed, you ſay the Court condemned me for matter of fact, and practice; be it ſo, but I ſay that matter of fact and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice was but the manifeſtation of my judgment and conſcience; and I make account that man is void of judgment, and conſcience, with reſpect unto God, that hath not a fact, and practice ſuitable thereunto; and for the things contained in my Sentence, they are rather collections, which the Court was pleaſed to make and draw from my words, than my words, themſelves; nevertheleſs I do not ſay they were unduly collected; for in truth, if the Faith and order which I profeſs do ſtand by the word of God, then the Faith and order which you profeſs muſt needs fall to the ground; and if the way you walk in remain, then the way that I walk in muſt vaniſh away, they cannot both ſtand together; to which they ſeem to aſſent; therefore I told them, that if they pleaſe to grant the motion under the Secretaries hand, I would draw up the Faith, and order, which I hold as the ſum of that I did deliver in open Court, into three or four Concluſions, which Concluſions I will ſtand by, and defend untill he, whom you ſhall appoint, ſhall by the word of God remove me from them; in caſe he ſhall remove me from them, then the diſputation is at an end, but if not, then I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire like liberty by the word of God to oppoſe the Faith, and order, which he and you profeſs, thereby to try whether I may be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument in the hand of God to remove you from the ſame; they told me the motion was very fair, and the way like unto a diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and thereupon concluded in my hearing, and directed alſo their ſpeech to me, ſaying, becauſe the matter is weighty, and we deſire that what can, may be ſpoken, when the diſputation

Whereupon the day following he inquired of the Keeper, when that Court of Aſſiſtants would be, (being reſolved not to chuſe his puniſhment, they being not able to make it appear by the Law of God or Man that he was a Tranſgreſſor ſo to be puniſhed) and being by him informed that it would be a quarter of a yeer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time came; and alſo, that if he were ſo reſolved, he might put in Bail for his appearance at the time aforeſaid, and ſo depart,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56389:18"/>
he forthwith put in Bail, and ſo departed to viſit his Family, being diſtant from thence threeſcore and ten miles. He was no ſooner at home, but his Spirit was unſatisfied in what he had done, in leaving us behind in the Priſon, though with our conſent and counſell he did what he did; whereupon, leaving his Harveſt upon the ſpoyl, within a few dayes he returned to us again, and tendered his perſon unto the Keeper, who refuſed it, ſaying, Since your departure I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive your Sentence is, That you ſhould not depart the Priſon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either paying the money, or putting in ſecurity for the payment of it; wherefore now either you or your Surety muſt pay it. To whom Brother <hi>Crandall</hi> replyed, you informed me otherwiſe before I went, and upon other termes I departed, wherefore for my own part I am reſolved I will not pay it, and for my Surety he is at his liberty, being no otherwiſe bound, than for my appearance, and here I am, and am your Priſoner; nevertheleſſe when I was releaſed, and turned out of Priſon, and could no longer upon that account there remain, I counſelled him to put the matter quite out of doubt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaid to the Iaylor, Let me know what I ſhall truſt to, for if you accept me upon the former account, well, I ſhall willingly tarry, and remain your Priſoner, but if not, I ſhall now repair home with my Friend to my Family; ſo after the Jaylor had adviſed with the Magiſtrate, he friendly told him, If he would promiſe to appear at the time appointed, he would take his word, become his Surety, and he might be gone; whereupon I being doubtfull, though he was confident concerning the time (there being an other Court between) deſired him to ſend us certain word to the Iland, when that Court of Aſſiſtants would be; ſo having his promiſe, we thankfully accepted his kindneſſe, &amp; ſo departed: And being at home we waited for a word from the Keeper for a return, but the firſt word we heard touching that matter, was, that the Court was paſt (which was that Court I ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected) &amp; that Brother <hi>Holmes</hi> had had his tryal by cruel ſcourgings. &amp; that the Iaylor being Brother <hi>Crandals</hi> Surety, by reaſon of his non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appearance was conſtrained to pay the money; hereupon not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Brother <hi>Crandall</hi> went to <hi>Boſton,</hi> and charged the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56389:19"/>
Principall was preſent, and was able through the ſtrength of Chriſt to anſwer the penalty: and thus having argued the caſe with the laylor, he left him without any grounds of hope to have it repaid, nevertheleſſe if advantage will be ſo ſtrictly taken upon the Keepers miſtake, neither Conſcience nor Equity will ſuffer us (it appearing to be a meer miſtake, and no plotted thing) not to ſuffer him to bear it, and thus it appears how a ſecond came off, and eſcaped a ſcourg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Now as concerning the third, by name <hi>Obediah Holmes,</hi> what is laid to his charge this Sentence under their Secretaries hand (a Copy whereof is here under written) will plainly expreſſe.</p>

And he that continueth to to the end, the ſame ſhall be ſaved.</hi> But then came in the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the weakneſſe of the Fleſh to bear the ſtrokes of a whip, though the Spirit was willing, and hereupon I was cauſed to pray earneſtly unto the Lord, that he would be pleaſed to give me a ſpirit of courage and boldneſſe, a tongue to ſpeak for him, and ſtrength of body to ſuffer for his ſake, and not to ſhrink or yeeld to the ſtroaks, or ſhed tears, leſt the adverſaries of the truth ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon blaſpheme, and be hardned, and the weak and feeble-hearted diſcouraged, and for this I befought the Lord earneſtly, at length he ſatisfied my ſpirit, to give up as my ſoul, ſo my body to him, and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly to leave the whole diſpoſing of the matter to him, and ſo I addreſſed my ſelf in as comely a manner as I could, having ſuch a Lord and Maſter to ſerve in this buſineſſe: And when I heard the voyce of my Keeper come for me, even cheerfulneſſe did come upon me, and taking my Teſtament in my hand, I went along with him to the place of execution, and after common ſalutation there ſtood; there ſtood by alſo one of the Magiſtrates, by name Mr. <hi>Encreaſe Nowell,</hi> who for a while kept ſilent, and ſpoke not a word, and ſo did I, expecting the Governours preſence, but he came not. But after a while Mr. <hi>Nowell</hi> bad the Executioner doe his Office, then I deſired to ſpeak a few words, but Mr. <hi>Nowell</hi> anſwered, it is not now a time to ſpeak, whereupon I took leave, and ſaid, <hi>Men, Brethren, Fathers, and Countrey-men, I beſeech you give me leave to ſpeak a few words, and the rather, becauſe here are many Spectators to ſee me puniſhed, and I am to ſeal with my Blood, if God give ſtrength,</hi>

brake forth, praying unto the Lord not to ſay this Sin to their charge, and telling the people, That now I found he did not fail me, and therefore now I ſhould truſt him for ever who failed me not; for in truth, as the ſtroaks fell upon me, I had ſuch a ſpirituall manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of Gods preſence, as the like thereto I never had, nor felt, nor can with fleſhly tongue expreſſe, and the outward pain was ſo removed from me, that indeed I am not able to declare it to you, it was ſo eaſie to me, that I could well bear it, yea and in a manner felt it not, although it was grievous, as the Spectators ſaid, the Man ſtriking with all his ſtrength (yea ſpitting on his hand three times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as many affirmed) with a three-coarded whip, giving me therewith thirty ſtroaks; when he had looſed me from the Poſt, having joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe in my heart, and cheerfulneſſe in my countenance, as the Spectators obſerved, I told the Magiſtrates, you have ſtruck me as with Roſes; and ſaid moreover, Although the Lord hath made it eaſie to me, yet I pray God it may not be laid to your charge.

and ſo began to deal with me for ſaying, they had abuſed the Church, and had took from them their power, whereupon I told them I ſhould renounce them, and not have any more fellowſhip with them, till ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſaw their Sin, or I further light; after which divers others to the number of ſeven, or eight fell off from them, and we met once a week, and every firſt day, and ſo continued for a long ſpace of time, yea and the day was known when we intended to be Baptized, and there were many Witneſſes obſerving our Faith, and Order, and yet not one Man or Woman of Mr. <hi>Newmans</hi> company that ever came to deal with me for evill, neither in Judgment, nor Practice, untill a long time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that appointment of our Lord was diſpenced; Thus I ſay, when I had ſeparated from them, and a long time after, I underſtood by their Meſſenger that they intended to proceed againſt me, ſo I deſired the meſſenger to tell me for what evill, he told me I ſhould know when I came there, ſo I ſent one of their own Brethren to tell them from me, though I owned them not as Brethren, yet if any Man or Woman had ought againſt me, I would come to them, although they had not delt with me according to any rule; but none came to me, nor charged me with any evill; and when upon occaſion I came before all the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and ſtrangers, I demanded for what cauſe it was that they proceeded againſt me, ſeing I had ſent to them before, and no man accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me; Mr. <hi>Newman</hi> told me, it was for non appearance; and now judge of the evill in your own way, and that for my Excommunication as you call it, I am by you rendred that wicked perſon; as for the ſuſpition of that moſt abominable evill of uncleanneſs, and Adultery, which many think I am guilty of, by reaſon of ſome perſons ſpeeches, I deſire to bleſs my Lord, who hath cauſed me to deny all uncleanneſs and wickedneſs, and God forbid that I ſhould take the Members of Chriſt, and make them the Members of an Harlot, and I challenge all Men and Women that dare ſtand before the judgment ſeat of the Lord, to come forth, and ſay if they ever heard unclean words proceed out of my mouth, or any unſeemly geſture, much leſs action, to any in my life at <hi>Salem, Seacunck,</hi> or elſwhere, yea let them come forth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any to meet me in private, or publick, upon any friends requeſt without the Magiſtrates Warrant; but I remember my Lord was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Belzebub, and what though I be called an Adulterer, or Witch, or Blaſphemer, and every one ſaith what he pleaſeth, yet I ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the judgment of my Lord; And whereas it was alſo reported I Baptized Goodwife <hi>Bowdiſh</hi> naked, I bleſs the Lord he hath taught me to do that which is comly, and of good report, yea and I know a

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56389:25"/>
ſome occaſion of buſineſs in theſe parts; yet the main buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that drew him hither, was to viſit the priſoner, whom he at this time took by the hand, who was indeed his neer Neighbour, lived in the ſame Town together, walked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſame fellowſhip, and faith of the Goſpell, and had their hearts knit together in a more than ordinary neer bond of love, and as a manifeſtation thereof, he undertoke ſo great a journey (it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between fourty and fifty miles) to viſit him, he being indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by reaſon of his age for ſuch an undertaking (being between three and fourſcore years old) and when he was there underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it would not be long before he ſhould ſuffer; out of the ſame ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der love, could not leave him before it was over; who alſo accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied him from the Priſon to the Poſt, and ſo back again; now for him, only for taking his friend by the hand, when he had ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his puniſhment, and was looſed from the Poſt, to be thus hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, ſhall not the Nations that know not civility, that neither fear God nor reverence man, be aſtoniſhed at this? if this be to do to others as we would that others ſhould do to us, which is the Law and the Prophets, the command of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, let all true Chriſtians judge; the Man being old did profeſſe, as I was informed, That if they ſhould have laid the ſtrokes upon him, they would certainly have killed him, which I know ceized not a little upon him, and how far what was done had influence into his death, the Lord onely knowes; for as is before ſaid, the ſame day he went forth, he fell ſick, and within ten dayes he died; The Lord grant that no part of his death may be laid to their charge, and that they may ſee the exceeding greatneſſe of the evill of thirſting after the blood of the Innocent, before the Lord come forth to avenge it, and as to that ſtory I ſhall ſay no more, but leave the Reader to his own relation, which partly in Priſon, and partly upon his death Bed, as may be perceived, he wrote and left behind him, with an intent it ſhould be publiſhed.

                        <p>I Going from place to place, to buy and take up commodities for my uſe, was attached or arreſted by the Marſhall, by virtue of a Warrant from the Court, to appear in the Court, and there to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56389:26"/>
for a high miſdemeanor committed by me, and coming into the Court (which was then privatly kept in the Chamber) they asked me divers queſtions, amongſt which this was one; Whether I did think that <hi>Obediah Holmes</hi> did well or not, in comming among them to baptize, and adminiſter the Sacrament. laying this to my charge, that I was one with him, and of the ſame judgement, and whether I did think he did well, or no, in his ſo carrying himſelf; to which I anſwered, I had here nothing to doe with that which another Man did<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but I was here to anſwer for what I my ſelf had committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Law; then ſaid they, you have offended our Law, and have contemned Authority, for you took him by the hand, and did countenance him in his ſin, ſo ſoon as he was gone from the Poſt, to which I ſaid, If I have broken any Law of the place, by what I then did, I am willing to ſubmit unto puniſhment; yea ſaid the Governour, you took him by the hand, did you not? and ſpake to him, what ſaid you? did you not ſay ſo and ſo? Bleſſed be God, &amp;c. To which I ſaid, I ſhall refer my ſelf unto the teſtimonies that may or can be brought againſt me; well, ſaid the Governour, wee ſhall find Teſtimony enough againſt you; take him to you Keeper, and we will call you forth in publick for that we doe with you we will proceed in publick with you, and ſo I went to Priſon. This was the ſum and ſubſtance of the firſt time I was called before them; the next day being the laſt day of the week, and the laſt day of their Court, I was in expectation all the forenoon to be called forth, but was not, ſo after dinner, when (as it appeareth) the Court was ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, and ſome of the Magiſtrates departed, I was ſent for again into the Chamber, where was the Governor with three others, <hi>ſcil.</hi> Mr. <hi>Bellingham,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hibbins,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Encreaſe Nowell,</hi> as ſoon as I was come into the room, the Governour read my Sentence, which was, that I muſt pay 40 ſh. or be well whipt, and ſo immediately he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and when he was gone (for I could not have time before) I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that I deſired the privilege of an Engliſh Subject, which was to be tryed by the Country, to wit, a Jury, and to be made to appear (if they can) to be a Tranſgreſſor by a Law: To which they ſaid, I had contemned Authority, and they had a Law to puniſh ſuch, and ſaid they, you did ſhew your contempt of Authority in that you did take ſuch a perſon by the hand, as ſoon as he was from the Poſt. To which I anſwered, I could not doe that which I did in contempt to Authority, ſeeing he had ſatisfied the Law to the full, and was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the place of ſuffering; and in the next place what I
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56389:26"/>
did, I did unto him as my Friend; And further I ſaid, if I had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him by the hand ſo ſoon as he was looſed from the Poſt, and had led him out of the Town, I ſhould not have broken any Law either of God or Man. To this they ſaid, That there was a Law in all Courts of Juſtice, both in Old <hi>England,</hi> and other Countreyes, to puniſh contempt of Authority, and ſo had they ſuch a Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves; To which I ſaid, That in Old <hi>England,</hi> and in other places they had ſuch a Law I denyed not, but that Law alſo was both Enacted and publiſhed, but what Law have I broken in taking my Friend by the hand, when he was free, and had ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Law? To this they replied, That he had not ſatisfied the Keeper; To this I anſwered, That he had talked with his Keeper, and there was ſome Agreement between them, and ſo in that ſence alſo not under the Law, but free; Then ſaid they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if you would have ſhewed kindneſſe unto your Friend, you might have forborn in that place, and done it more privately; To which I anſwered, I knew not but that place was as free as another, he having ſatisfied the Law. The Teſtimony that was given by Mr. <hi>Cole</hi> was this, <hi>ſci. I ſaw</hi> Iohn Hazell <hi>take</hi> Obediah Holmes <hi>by the hand, but what he ſaid I cannot tell;</hi> this is the Subſtance of all the proceedings untill the laſt day at night, and then they ſaid I ſhould be whipped, but ſaid ſome of their Officers, the Whipper cannot be found, then they commanded that they ſhould be ready by the ſecond day morning, and then I did expect to be called forth, but neither that day, nor the third, nor fourth, was I called, but am as I underſtand reſerved unto the 5th day, to be more publick in the view of the World, and when the 5th day came, as I had many before, ſo alſo then, that would have paid the Fine, if I would give my conſent, which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed to doe, and ſo ſet my ſelf by the power of Chriſt to ſuffer what ſhould be inflicted upon me, but when Noon came I was told I ſhould not ſuffer whipping, yet not having a diſcharge, I did not look to be freed untill the Keeper told me, I might goe about my buſineſſe; then I demanded a diſcharge (meaning under the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates hands) ſo he bad me goe, he would diſcharge me.</p>
                        <p>The ſtrokes I was enjoyned by the Court to have, were 10 with a three-corded whip, the very ſame number I underſtand, that the worſt Malefactors that were there puniſhed had, of which ſome were guilty of common Whoredom, other of forcing a little Child, and one <hi>Indian</hi> for coyning of money; thus far have you a relati<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>Now of what hath been ſpoken in this Narrative (Reader) this is the ſum.</p>
            <p>1 THou maiſt underſtand that the next morning after we three, being ſtrangers, were come to our friends houſe at Lin where we lodged (it being two miles out of the town) we were perſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and alſo apprehended by the Conſtables under the name of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronious perſons being ſtrangers, and by that power were caried (after a full and clear manifeſtation of our unfreeneſs) unto their Aſſembly, then to Priſon, and after a while were alſo brought before their Iudgment ſeat; in which two Aſſemblies, to which we were forced, they drew forth matter enough as they conceived to make us tranſgreſſors, &amp; thereupon proceeded to ſentence us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out producing either Accuſer, Witneſs, Iury, Law of God, or man, whereby either we might appear to be guilty, or they to be juſt and juſtified in their proceedings againſt us.</p>
            <p>2 After we were thus perſued, and apprehended under the name of erronious perſons and ſtrangers, and by their Court condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and ſentenced as Herericks or ſciſmaticks, a motion being made by their Governour touching a diſcourſe with their Miniſters, was readily accepted by us, and often repeated, and as often promiſed by them, but yet could not be obtained, as is here at large to be ſeen.</p>
            <p>3 Although through the mercifull hand of our God upon us, we had wronged no man, corrupted no man, defrauded no man, as he, together with our Conſciences, then did, and ſtill to this day,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56389:27"/>
do bear us witneſs yet beſides the exceeding great loſs and detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment otherwiſe ſuſtained, we had all no doubt met with as cruell Scourgings as his faithfull ſervants of old, had not the provident hand of our God ſo diſpoſed the hearts of ſome of our friends to lay down our ranſome, by which two did eſcape; and this did evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear in the third who came under their zealous, yet mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſs hands, and received from them 50 ſtripes above the reſtraint of the Iews, as writers report, yea and ſuch entertainment no doubt ſhould ſtrangers or Angels from Heaven, yea Chriſt Ieſus himſelf have received at their hands, if they could effect it, in caſe they ſhould have come among them, and not ſubmitted, (as it is not poſſible they ſhould) unto that golden, and glorious Image or likeneſs of the worſhip and way of God appointed by Chriſt which they have ſet up.</p>
            <p>4 When this faithfull Martyr and Witneſs, that Chriſt is the Lord, had born this fourſcore and ten ſtripes cruelly laid on, not only with a patient mind, but with an exceeding great joy of the holy ſpirit, as the ſpectators could not but diſcern, and was loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the Poſt, and was going to Priſon again, ſome being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly moved with joy in beholding the gracious ſupport which the Lord afforded him (as they have affirmed) could not forbear to take him by the hand, for which thing ſake two of them were apprehended &amp; ſentenced to pay each of them 40 s or els be whipt. Let the Actors themſelves, and all that peruſe their practice for cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſake conſider, whether the ſpirit by which they are led thus to act, be not very like unto, if not the ſame which is ſeen, Revel. 13. <hi>Acting the ſecond Beaſt that aroſe up out of the Earth which had two hornes like a Lamb, yet ſpake like a Dragon, and exerciſed all the power of the firſt Beaſt that was before him, cauſed a lively Image to be made unto him, and forced the Earth and them that dwel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, both ſmall and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to worſhip his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and that no man might buy, or ſell, ſave he, that had the marke, or the name, or the number of his name.</hi> Here is Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom! and let ſuch as deſire from their hearts to live Godly in Chriſt Ieſus, and do as really expect to ſuffer with Chriſt in this preſent evill World, as they do to reign with him in that good World which yet is to come, let ſuch I ſay conſider, and bear ſtill in mind theſe expreſſions, Revel. 13. 10. <hi>He that leadeth into Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity ſhall go into Captivity, he that killeth with the Sword muſt be killed with the Sword; here is the patience and faith of the S<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:56389:28"/>Rev. 12. 11. <hi>And they overcame him by the bloud of the Lamb, and by the Word of their Teſtimony, and they loved not their lives unto the death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rev. 6. 9, 10, 11. <hi>I ſaw under the Altar the Souls of them that were ſlain for the Word of God, and for the teſtimony which they beld; And they cryed with a loud voice ſaying, how long holy and true wilt thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwel on the Earth, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rev. 20. 4. <hi>And I ſaw the Souls of them that were beheaded for the Witneſs of Ieſus, and for the Word of God, and which had not worſhiped the Beaſt, neither his Image, neither had received the marke upon their foreheads; or in their hands, and they lived and reigned with Chriſt a thouſand years.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now foraſmuch as it was boldly affirmed by a Solicitor for <hi>New-England,</hi> and that in the Councell Chamber before that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Committee there aſſembled in Councell, that men in <hi>New-England</hi> might freely injoy their underſtandings, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, provided they walk civilly among them, and that they that ſuffered of late, did not ſuffer for their Conſciences but for ſome miſdemeanor, thereby endeavouring to poſſeſs thoſe noble breſts with that which is falſe; therefore I think it neceſſary (both for the Vindication of truth, and to the end that ſuch worthy perſons may not be taken with, or deceived by ſuch unworthy reports, ſo as to be drawn to countenance perſons that walk in a way that they are aſhamed in plain and open terms to proſeſs, and acknowledge, for theſe ends I ſay I think it neceſſary to produce their Laws, at leaſt ſuch as ſpeak to the matter in queſtion, whereby theſe two things will plainly appear.</p>
            <p>1 That they that will not, or elſe in Conſcience towards God cannot conform to their worſhip, or ſuſpend the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God as their Souls are perſwaded, are by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of their Laws to be forced to the one, and reſtrained from the other, and that the Magiſtrate is thereby not only juſtified in, but alſo injoyned unto, ſuch a proceeding againſt them, although the men otherwiſe walk not only as civilly or ſoberly as themſelves, but alſo righteouſly, and Godly in this preſent evill World, and are ſuch indeed as are a Law to themſelves.</p>
            <p>2 Although they have Laws thus to proceed to force all to their worſhip, &amp; to reſtrain thoſe that differ from them, from that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to which their Souls are perſwaded, yet in our caſe they were
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56389:28"/>
ſo far tranſported with zeal, that, what they did unto us, they did without Law, yea againſt thoſe Cautions which their own, Laws have provided.</p>

And laſtly, the ſufficiency of this High Prieſt to make a perfect attonement for all thoſe that come to God through him.</p>
               <p>Touching the nature of the attonement, it is not amiſſe to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that what was by this word attonement expreſt under the firſt Teſtament, while that Prieſthood ſtood, hath been ſince under the adminiſtration of the laſt Teſtament, that is eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes than that, been expreſt more frequently by the word Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, and therefore the word that in the 5 <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered attonement, is in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 18, 19. and in all other places tranſlated by the word Reconciliation; Now Reconciliation does pre-ſuppoſe an eſtrangedneſſe, or enmity rather, between two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and if the parties were men, peradventure there might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found a man to mediate; but the enmity lies not ſo much between man and man, or between men and Angels, good or bad, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and man, the Creator and the creature, and who is he in Heaven, or in Earth, that dare interpoſe, or ſtep in to make a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation between theſe two? yea, who can effect it? eſpecially if we conſider that the enmity on the creatures part is rooted in his mind, and cannot be eradicated (I had almoſt ſayd, and yet I think I ſhall not need to retract it) by the powerfull hand of God himſelfe ſtretcht forth in his wrath, his mind ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, as indeed doth notably appear out of the mouth of the Lord himſelf, by the hand of his Prophet <hi>Iſay,</hi> 57. 16, 17. For the iniquity of his covetouſneſſe, was I wroth, and ſmote him; I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart. So ſee it confirmed alſo in <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 9. 11. 21. when the wrath of God breaks forth with an excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56389:32"/>
great Plague, then ſhall you find men blaſpheming the name of God, who hath power over thoſe Plagues, becauſe of their paines and their ſores, and repented not of their evill deeds, to give him glory; and if the wrath of God does it not, how unlike is the wrath of man to effect it? But further to ſhew the greatneſſe of the work of Reconciliation as it lies on mans part; for as he hath not an alienation only, but an enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in his mind, ſo is he apt upon all occaſions to the utmoſt of his power to manifeſt the ſame, by wicked provoking workes againſt the God of Heaven, ſo that let but God himſelf be manifeſted in the fleſh, or any bright beam of his glory break forth, and ſhine through mortall fleſh, preſently ſhall the Iewes, and Gentiles, though otherwiſe full of enmity one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt an other, concurre; yea, <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> ſhall now be made friends, and ſhall agree to Crucifie the Lord of Life and Glory; to pour forth the pretious Blood of God, and to tread under foot the Sonne of God, and to count the blood of that Covenant as an unholy thing: So that from hence we may conclude, That as he that hateth his Brother in his heart may be ſaid to murther a man, ſo he that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth God in his heart, may be ſaid in a ſenſe to murder God. Now as on mans part there appears ſuch enmity in his mind, ſuch an aptneſſe to vent it, and ſuch backwardneſſe (as I might ſhew) in him to accept of any, but eſpecially the Goſpell termes of Reconciliation, whereby the work appears to be great; So if we conſider it on Gods part, that the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven, againſt all ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and againſt all unrighteouſneſſe of the Sonnes of Men, and that his word is gone forth and cannot be recalled; In the day that thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely dye; and the Soul that ſinneth, it ſhall dye; and curſed is every one that continueth not in all things that are written in the Law to doe them, ſo that his Wrath, luſtice, and Truth are all engaged in this main controverſie that he hath with his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and by reaſon thereof, he will not be pleaſed with thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Rams, nor yet with ten thouſand Rivers of Oyl, &amp;c. And therefore if the queſtion be asked who is worthy, or who is able to ſtand between God and Man, to make the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement, to ſlay the enmity, and ſo to make peace? The anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer will be the ſame, That no man (that is meerly ſo, no nor
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56389:32"/>
Angel) in Heaven, nor in Earth nor under the Earth is either wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, or able to undertake this great work, no nor in that ſenſe to look thereon; And therefore in the ſecond place all other Prieſts will be found inſufficient; for as for the Prieſts of old, and all that belonged to them, as Veſtures, Veſſels, Altars, Temple; and all that was officiated by them, as their Sacrifices, Attonements, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, bleſſings, they were too weak to accompliſh this work, for they were not able to make him perfect that did the ſervice, as appertaining to the Conſcience, but brought their ſins to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, in ſtead of blotting them out, ſo as to remember them no more, and were indeed but meer ſhadowes of good things to come, which they that beleeved had in their eye, and ſaw a farre off, ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 18, 19. 9. 9. 10. 1, 2, 3, 4, 11. and as for others that are made Prieſts unto God, they doe but receive of his fulneſſe, and will readily acknowledge with <hi>Paul,</hi> that through the Law they are dead to the Law, ſo as by their own works or righteouſneſſe (which now appears to be but gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering wickedneſſe, and no other than fruits of that enmity that was in their minds, by them I ſay) not to expect to make their own peace with God; and although it is true they have liberty to enter into the holieſt, yet it is by the blood of Ieſus, and by a new and living way which he hath conſecrated for them; and although they may draw neer unto the holy God with a true heart, and full aſſurance of Faith, yet they muſt have their hearts ſprinkled with his blood from an evill conſcience, and their bodies waſhed with pure water; and although being in the holy preſence of God, they may, as the Prieſts of old, offer up prayers with ſtrong cryes for themſelves, and others, yet muſt they be offered upon the golden Altar that is before the Throne, and muſt be mingled, and perfumed with much ſweet incenſe out of the golden cenſer that is in the Angell of the Covenants hand, and the ſmoke of the incenſe muſt aſcend with their prayers before God out of the Angels hand: <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. 3, 4 ſo that in this point they are nothing, yea leſſe, and worſe than nothing; but Chriſt is the very power of God in this point, the ſubſtance of all thoſe ſhadowes, and what he did in reference to the work of attonement, and reconciliation, he doth it ſubſtantially and effectually, both on Gods part and mans; for he hath both natures in himſelf, and by reaſon thereof is an apt Mediator fit to interpoſe between both to make reconciliation; for he is declared to be the Son of God, wholly without ſin, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated

By all which it doth appear to be a truth, that there is none to him in point of attonement to make reconciliation between God and Man. And now that there is none with him in that great work, neither perſon, nor ſervice, is alſo as evident. God the Father hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned him alone in that buſineſſe, that no Fleſh might glory in his preſence, ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 11. 12. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Colloſſ.</hi> 1. 20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 29.

And now that there is none to him in point of inſtruction, will alſo appear with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect both to the matter and efficacy. 1 For the matter of inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he that cometh from above being alſo in the boſome of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, muſt needs be above all in his matter of inſtruction, for what he hath heard and ſeen in the Fathers boſome, that he Teſtifies, and ſpeaketh the very words of God, yea declareth and maketh known God himſelf, being the bright breaking-forth of the Fathers glory, which was that which <hi>Moſes,</hi> that great Prophet did ſo much deſire to behold, and could not obtain it; and hence it is, that it is ſaid his hearers were aſtoniſhed at his Doctrine, concluded no man ever
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56389:34"/>
ſpake like this man, and the beſt of them knew not whether to go to better themſelves, foraſmuch as he had the words of eternall life, yea and that holy Spirit of promiſe which the Saints were and ſtill are to receive, was but to glorifie him, to take of him and his words, and to ſhew unto them the treaſures of light and life, and refreſhment that is contained therein; ſee for the proof of all this, 1 <hi>Io.</hi> 17. 18. <hi>Io.</hi> 3. 31, 32, 34. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Exo.</hi> 33. 18, 27. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 28. <hi>Io.</hi> 7. 46. <hi>Io.</hi> 6. 68. <hi>Io.</hi> 14. 26. &amp; 16. 12, 13, 14. And as for excellency of matter, ſo for efficacy and powerfull inſtructing, there is none to him in point of inſtruction, for he it is in whoſe hand is the Key of David, and he openeth the heart to underſtand the ſcriptures; and to ſhew a lively experiment of his powerfull inſtructing, when he was here up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, he paſt by the wiſe and learned Rabbies, and called the illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and fooliſh Fiſhermen, and to this day doth chooſe not many wiſe, nor many learned, but the poor fooliſh and deſpiſed ones, that as a teacher he may ſhew his abilities, thereby giving un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to the ſimple, ſpeaking words of light, and life, and ſpirit to them, and by them to confound the wiſe, and learned, and mighty; yea he indeed is the light of the Gentiles which ſate (and ſtill in a great meaſure ſit) in darkneſs, and is that true light that enlightneth every one that cometh into the World, ſee 24 <hi>Luke</hi> 45. 1 <hi>Corinthians</hi> 1. 26, 27. <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 63. <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 47. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 9. And as he was the Prophet, opening his Fathers Boſome, and ſhewing the things that were paſt and preſent, ſo the things alſo that were to come; he tells them how many things he muſt ſuffer of the Elders, and Chief Prieſts, and Scribes, and be killed, and raiſed again the third day, and therein foreſheweth his Office of Prieſthood; he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo foretells how after he is riſen as a Lord, he will ſet his Houſe in order, and ſo depart to his Father to receive his Kingdom, and to return, and what ſhall befall his Servants in the time of his abſence, by the reign and rage of the Beaſt, and Spirit of Antichriſt, and what will be each ones portion at his return, as appears in the book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> which is ſurrounded with bleſſings to him that readeth, Chapter 1. 3. and curſes to him that addeth to it, or taketh from it, Chapr. laſt 18. 19.

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56389:35"/>
is not a law of a carnall commandment ſeconded with carnall weapons, or an arm of fleſh: but a ſpirituall law, or as the Apoſtle cals it <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>a law of the Spirit of life from Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> ſpoken unto, or rather written in the heart of a Chriſtian by the Spirit of Chriſt, by reaſon whereof he obeyes from the heart, readily, willingly and cheerfully that form of doctrine which is engraven and laid up therein, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 17. If this I ſay be conſidered, that the worſhip is ſpirituall, ſuch as muſt begin in, ſpring up, and riſe from the heart and the ſpirit, and ſo be directed to the Father of ſpirits, and ſo the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding power that ſuits herewith, muſt ſpeak to the heart and ſpirit of a man, then is there no Lord in this matter to Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, who ſpeaks to the heart in the Spirit, and his words are as commands from the head to the members, which conveigh together ſpirit and life to obey them, by reaſon of which his commands are not grievous, for where the Spirit of this Lord is, there is liberty, and they by beholding the glory of the Lord, are transformed into the ſame Image, from glory unto glory, by the Spirit of the Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 17, 18.</p>
               <p>And that there is none with him, he is the onely Lord, and law-giver of this ſpirituall building, and ſo of the ſpirits in this ſenſe, appears by ſuch ſcriptures as ſay, <hi>One is your Lord and law-giver, James</hi> 4. 12. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 5. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 8. 10. and by ſuch as ſay, <hi>ye are bought with a price, be ye not therefore the ſervants of men,</hi> and the Apoſtles that had greater authority in this point than any men living, yet they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge they had not Dominion over mens faith, and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare this to be the expreſs mind of God, that the ſervants of this Lord muſt not ſtrive (as if they were Lords) but be patient, in meekneſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing thoſe that oppoſe themſelves, or as the word imports, that ſet themſelves by covenant in oppoſition to that living Lord.

               <p>2. [<hi>I teſtifie that Baptiſm or dipping in water is one of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of this Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>] That this commandment of Jeſus is by way of dipping, and as it were by drowning, overwhelming, or
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56389:36"/>
burying in water, and not by ſprinkling with water, appears many waies.</p>
               <p>1. In that although there be frequent mention made of that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of Chriſt in his Laſt Will and Teſtament, yet is it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver expreſſed by the word that may be rendred rantiſm, or ſprinkling, but by the word that is rendred baptiſm, or dipping.</p>
               <p>2. In that the word by which it is ſo frequently expreſt doth in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Engliſh ſignify to dip, to plung under water, and as it were to drown, but yet ſo as with ſafety, ſo that the party (as to the manner) may be drowned again, and again; ſee the inſtance of <hi>Naaman,</hi> he dipp'd himſelf ſeven times in <hi>Jordan,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5. 14. and to this ſenſe of the word (at leaſt in that place) both the <hi>Greek, Latine,</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Churches agree.</p>
               <p>3. In that the phraſe (in which there is mention made of ſuch an appointment of Chriſt) doth neceſſarily import ſuch a thing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when mention is made of baptizing, there generally followeth that word the prepoſition (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) which is commonly tranſlated in, or into, which ſuits with dipping, and not the prepoſition (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) which ſignifies with, and ſo ſuits with ſprinkling. And therefore it may be as well rendred, I baptize you in water, and he ſhall baptize you in the holy Spirit, <hi>Mar.</hi> 1. 8. as it is rendred <hi>Iohn</hi> did baptize in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and in the River of <hi>Jordan, verſe</hi> 4, 5. or that <hi>Iohn</hi> was in the Spirit on the Lords day, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 10. and they were baptized in the cloud and in the Sea, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 2. yea it may as well be rendred, I baptize, or dip you into water, as it is rendred they were caſting a net into the Sea <hi>Mar.</hi> 1. 16. for the words are the ſame, and it would be an improper ſpeech to ſay <hi>Iohn</hi> did baptiſe with the wilderneſs, and they were caſting a net with the ſea.</p>
               <p>4. That this appointment of Chriſt is by way of dipping, and not ſprinkling, appears, in that for the reſemblance, and likeneſs hereunto, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> paſſing under the cloud, and through the ſea, where the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> that were their Lords, and commanders, their purſuers, and enemies, that ſought their deſtruction, were drowned, left behind, and ſeen no more, is by the holy Spirit called a baptiſm, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 1, 2. they were baptized in the cloud, &amp;c. Where obſerve it is not here ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred with the cloud, and with the Sea, as in the other place, <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 8. with water, becauſe it ſuits with ſprinkling, although the word be the ſame; but in the cloud, and in the Sea, which ſuits with dipping,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56389:36"/>
or overwhelming, and ſo with the appointment of Chriſt, they paſſing through the midſt of the red or bloudy Sea on dry land, which ſtood on both ſides as a wall, and being under the Cloud, were as men in a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall eie overwhelmed and drowned, and yet truly ſaved, and ſafe from their enemies.</p>
               <p>5. That this appointment of Chriſt was not by ſprinkling, but by dipping, or putting the perſon into or under the water, appears by <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips</hi> baptizing the <hi>Eunuch;</hi> It is ſaid, <hi>They went both down into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> both <hi>Philip</hi> the baptizer, and the <hi>Eunuch</hi> that was the perſon to be baptized, and being there in the water, <hi>Philip</hi> baptized, or dipper him in that water, as <hi>John</hi> did <hi>Jeſus</hi> in the river of <hi>Jordan,</hi> and then it is ſaid as they deſcended, or went down into the water, ſo they aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or went ſtrait way up out of the water, ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 38, 39. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 16. mark the expreſſion, <hi>And Jeſus when he was baptized went up ſtraitway out of the water,</hi> therefore had he been down in the water.</p>
               <p>6. That this appointment of Chriſt was not by ſprinkling, but by dipping, or as it were a drowning, appears, in that <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptizer, his work being to baptize, remains in the wilderneſs by the river of <hi>Iordan,</hi> and afterward in <hi>Aenon,</hi> and the reaſon that is rendred by the Spirit of God why there he abode, was, <hi>becauſe there was much water there,</hi> which need not have been, if that appointment could have been performed by ſprinkling, and not by dipping. See <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 2, 3. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 23.</p>
               <p>7. That this appointment of Chriſt was not to be performed by ſprinkling, but by diping, &amp;c. appears from the nature of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance it ſelf, for it is ſuch an ordinance as whereby the perſon that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth thereto, doth viſibly put on Chriſt Ieſus the Lord, and is hereby viſibly planted into his death, holding forth therein a lively ſimilitude, and likeneſs unto his death; whereby onely through faith he now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth he hath eſcaped death, and is in hope to obtain life, and peace everlaſting, and ſo to have fellowſhip with him in his death, as to be dead with him, and thereupon to reckon himſelf to be dead indeed unto ſin, Sathan, the law, and the curſe. See <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 27. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 2. 3. 5. 7, 8. 11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 29. But the planting of a perſon into the likneſs of death is no waies reſembled by ſprinkling; but by dipping it is lively ſet forth and demonſtrated, therefore.</p>
               <p>8. This appointment of Chriſt, <hi>ſci.</hi> Baptiſm, is an ordinance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the perſon that ſubmitteth thereto, doth hereby viſibly and cleerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the buriall of Chriſt, and his being buried with him, ſo as in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56389:37"/>
reſpect of the old man, the former luſts and converſation, like the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> to be taken out of the way, and ſeen no more. See <hi>Romans</hi> 6. 4. 6. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 12. But ſprinkling doth no way lively reſemble the buriall of Chriſt, or the perſons being buried with him, as dipping doth; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>9. This appointment of Chriſt, <hi>ſci.</hi> Baptiſm, is an ordinance wherby the perſon that ſubmitteth thereto, doth viſibly, and lively hold forth herein the reſurrection of Chriſt, declares him, whoſe life was taken from the earth, to be alive again, who although he died and was buried, yet was he not left in the grave to ſee corruption, but was raiſed again, and behold he liveth for evermore; and as hereby he holds forth the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Chriſt, ſo doth he alſo his own, being planted into the likeneſs therof, ſo as to reckon himſelf to be in his ſoul and ſpirit quickned, and riſen with Chriſt, from henceforth to live unto God the fountain of life, and to Chriſt Ieſus the Lord who died for him, and roſe again, and ſo to walk in newneſs of life in this preſent evill world, being alſo begotten unto a lively hope, that in the world to come he ſhall be raiſed, and quickned both in ſoul, and body, to a life everlaſting. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 4, 5. 8. 11. <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 33, 35, 36. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 29. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3. but ſprinkling doth no way lively reſemble the reſurrection of Chriſt, or the ſouls or bodies riſing, or being raiſed by him, as the way of dipping doth. Therefore this appointment of Chriſt was, and ſtill is, to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by way of dipping or putting the perſon into or under the water, and not by ſprinkling.</p>
               <p>And that this dipping in, or into water, in the name of Ieſus, is one of the commandments of this Lord Ieſus Chriſt, doth evidently appear <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15, 16 compared with <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38. 41. 8. 36. 38. and 10. 47, 48. And that it is alſo to be obſerved by all that truſt in Chriſt, as other of his commands, as he is the Lord, untill he come again, is likewiſe expreſly manifeſted to be his will, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 20. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 7, 8. <hi>Jude</hi> 3. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 5, 6. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 25. 3. 11. <hi>Hold fast till I come. Rev.</hi> 22. 14. 19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 25. But to proceed.</p>
               <p>[<hi>That a viſible believer or diſciple of Christ Jeſus (that is, one that manifesteth repentance towards God, and faith in Jeſus Chriſt) is the onely perſon that is to be baptiſed with that viſible baptiſm or dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Jeſus Chriſt in water</hi>] That a viſible diſciple or Scholar of Chriſt, one that manifeſteth himſelf to have heard him, to have been
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56389:37"/>
taught by him, and to have yielded up himſelf to him as his teacher, is the only perſon, &amp;c. will be made manifeſt,</p>
               <p>1. By the commiſſion it ſelf, and the argument ſtands thus, they and they onely have right to this ordinance, and appointment of Jeſus Chriſt, whom the ordainer himſelf, <hi>ſci.</hi> Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, hath in his Laſt Will and Teſtament appointed it to; but Chriſt Jeſus the Lord hath appointed it to Diſciples, and to Believers, and to ſuch onely. Therefore.</p>
               <p>The firſt propoſition cannot be denyed, and the ſecond will eaſily be proved: ſee the commiſſion by which the Apoſtles were warranted to adminiſter this ordinance, and ſo muſt all that baptiſe or they will appear but uſurpers <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18, 19. All power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth, ſaith the Lord, go ye therefore and diſcipulize or make diſciples not among the Jews only, but among the Gentiles, and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and baptize them; ſo that if the queſtion ſhould have been made, Lord whom ſhall we baptiſe of the Nations among the Jews and Gentiles? his anſwer was given in the words before, and he would have given no other, you ſhall baptize amongſt the Nations Jews and Gentiles, ſuch as firſt have been taught, and by teaching have been made my diſciples; ſo <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 16. Go ye into all the world, ſaith the Lord, and preach the Goſpel to every creature, to the Gentiles as well as the Jews, he that beleeveth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved, &amp;c. So that if the queſtion here again ſhould be propounded who among the religious and ſtrict Jews, and the looſe and profane Gentiles, ſhould be baptiſed, the anſwer is plain, thoſe to whom the Goſpel firſt hath been preached, and they through that Goſpel have alſo believed.</p>
               <p>2. By the practice of the Commiſſioners who were faithful unto their Lord, and to the charge which he gave them, and the argument ſtands thus.</p>
               <p>Such as the faithful Apoſtles, and firſt Commiſſioners of Chriſt Jeſus the Lord adminiſtred this ordinance of baptiſm unto, ſuch and ſuch only ought to be made partakers thereof.</p>
               <p>But the Apoſtles and firſt Commiſſioners of Chriſt adminiſtred not this ordinance unto carnal babes, infants of daies, ſuch as are by the teſtimony of the Scriptures declared to be conceived in ſin, to be brought forth in iniquity, and being born of the fleſh to be but fleſh, and ſo by nature the Children of wrath one as well as another; being alſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taught. But to ſuch as firſt were taught, and were ordained, by the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56389:38"/>
immortal ſeed of the word, to be born again, and as new born babes in Chriſt, having taſted of the ſincere milk of the word, deſire ſtill more of the ſame, that they might grow up thereby, and ſuch as appeared to be converted and to become as little ones, ſuch little ones as believed in <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt propoſition I ſuppoſe none that own Chriſt and his Apoſtles will dare to deny. And the ſecond which is more queſtionable will alſo be proved. See <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, &amp;c. Although <hi>Peter</hi> with the 11 calls upon the convicted Jews to repent, and to be baptized every one in the name of Jeſus for the remiſſion of ſins, and tells them that then they ſhall be made partakers of the holy Spirit; and that they ſhould not need to diſtruſt it; he ſhews them the largeneſs of the promiſe that was made concerning the pouring forth of the Spirit, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing promiſed to be poured forth upon all fleſh, as they had expreſt in the beginning of their diſcourſe out of <hi>Joel</hi> v. 16. and 17. and therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aith, tis to you and to your Children, and to all that are a far off, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as many (of you, your children and ſuch as are a far off) as the Lord our God ſhall call; yet he baptizeth none, but ſuch as were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the holding forth the word of ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the words, for they that gladly received his word were baptized; and they only; for they that were baptized were added, and continued to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the Apoſtles Doctrine, and in fellowſhip, and in breaking of bread, and in prayer, and continued dayly with one accord in the Temple, and breaking bread from houſe to houſe did eat their meat with gladneſs and ſingleneſs of heart, praiſing God: all which cannot be underſtood of infants of daies. And therefore this place if rightly conſidered will be ſo far from affording a ground for the baptizing of the children of believing parents, becauſe here it is ſaid the promiſe is to you and to your children, that it will ſufficiently evince the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; for indeed ſuch an apprehenſion is accompanyed with 2 or 3 evident miſtakes, there is a miſtake in the promiſe, in the parties to whom the promiſe belongs, and the manner how it is to them and their children, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>1. There is a miſtake of the promiſe, in that it is looked at as the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace which doth ingratiate the ſoul into, and gives it an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in all the privileges of the Goſpel of Chriſt, and ſo in order doth go before baptiſm or any other viſible ordinance and appointment of his, whereas in very truth by promiſe there, is meant that holy Spirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56389:38"/>
which they which believed in Chriſt, and obeyed him, ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to promiſe receive after he was aſcended unto the right hand of the father, as appears <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 39. 14. 16. 16. 7. That which he had here ſhed a broad in a powerfull manner upon the Apoſtles, and that which theſe Jews alſo in believing and obeying the Goſpel of Chriſt ſhould alſo receive, and therfore ſaith <hi>Peter,</hi> repent, and be baptized and ye ſhall receive, &amp;c. and was no other than that which was of old prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyed of by <hi>Ioel,</hi> as is declared v. 16. and ſo is a promiſe that follows faith and obedience, and not ſuch as goes before to give right to this appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>2. There is a miſtake in the parties to whom this promiſe belongs, for whereas it is ſaid <hi>to you and to your children,</hi> and the reupon it is conceived to be meant believers, and their infants of daies, which upon that accompt are to be baptized, it is plain and evident when the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpoke theſe words to them, they could not be looked upon as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, foraſmuch as they being prick'd at the heart, and only convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of their evill in murdering the Lord of life, propounded what they ſhould do to be ſaved, which is farre from believing, to which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle replies, <hi>repent, and be baptized in the name of Jeſus for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinnes;</hi> and to conceive that by their children were meant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of daies, it may be as well ſo underſtood by your Sonnes and daughters, which ſhould ſo receive of the promiſe of the Spirit as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy mentioned in the ſeventeenth verſe of this chapter, to which theſe words are related; and to make it appear that the promiſe was not ſo either to them or their children (as yet manifeſted) to give them right unto baptiſm, after many more words uſed by the Apoſtle to perſwade them to ſave themſelves from this adulterous generation, it is ſaid, but as many as gladly received his word were baptized, and but only ſuch, and not their infants of daies, for they that were baptized continued together in ſuch appointments of Chriſt as infants are in no meaſure ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of.</p>
               <p>3. There is a miſtake in the manner how this promiſe is to them, &amp; their children, not ſpoken to them now as believers, &amp; their children as having right and intereſt peculiar by them, but indeed to them and their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren no otherwiſe than to all that are a far off, which if taken in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall cannot be underſtood but with reſpect to the general promiſe, which is to pour forth his Spirit upon all fleſh, but if with the reſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is, even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call, then, parents
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56389:39"/>
and children, Jews and Gentiles, ſuch as are neer, and ſuch as are a far off, muſt be called by the word of his grace before they can have a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar right and intereſt in this ſpirit of promiſe, and ſo a child that is called to believe and obey the Goſpel may have this promiſe made good unto him before his father, and a Gentile that is a far off before a Jew that is neer.</p>
               <p>This will appear alſo by other inſtances, as of <hi>Philip</hi> baptizing in <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> they were men and women that he baptiſed there, ſuch as believed and received the word with great joy, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 8. 12. and when the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch</hi> ſeeing the water, asked <hi>what ſhould let him to be baptiſed, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> intimates that although he had been taught, yet the want of a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of faith would be a let, <hi>v.</hi> 36, 37. And whereas there is mention made of whole houſes that were baptiſed; that the Commiſſioners might appear faithfull unto their Lord, and keep cloſe to the very words of their Commiſſion, you ſhall find they were firſt taught, and by teaching were made his diſciples, and gladly received his word.

That <hi>Lydia</hi> ever had a husband. 2. In caſe ſhe had, that ever ſhe had any children by him, and if ſo, then in the 3. place that they were not dead, or ſo grown up that they might hear and receive the word gladly as well as their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>3. A third argument to prove that a viſible believer is the perſon that according to the mind of Chriſt is to be baptized in water, may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the order which the Spirit of Chriſt laies down, faith and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, in the ſcriptures of truth, putting faith ſtill in the firſt place, witneſs <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15, 16. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. A 4 argument may be taken from the nature of the ordinance, and a 5 from <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſm. Yea much more might be ſaid to this point, but this may ſuffice.</p>

                  <hi>houſe, and ſo to wait for his comming the ſecond time in the form of a Lord and King with his glorious Kingdome according to promiſe</hi>] That he is the only perſon that is to enter into, and walk in the viſible order of his houſe, will evidently appear, if the order in which our Lord left his houſe when he went to his Father to receive his kingdome be du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered, for in his laſt will and teſtament we ſhall find it thus recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, when our Lord was about to be gone, he gave order unto his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, whom he made ſtewards in his houſe of the myſteries of God, to make him Diſciples of all Nations, and that ſuch as were ſo made ſhould then be baptized, and ſo viſibly planted into Chriſt, and put on Chriſt, and having ſo received him, ſhould walk in him, obſerving all things whatſoever he had commanded, the firſt thing wherof as touching order was, to be added or joined one to another in the fellowſhip of the Goſpel by a mutual profeſſed ſubjection to the Scepter of Chriſt, and being a company thus called out of the world, from worldly vanities, and worldly worſhips, after Chriſt Jeſus the Lord (which is the proper <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> of theſe words the Church of Chriſt, and is in other terms called the Houſhold of faith) ſhould ſteadfaſtly continue together in the Apoſtles doctrine, <hi>ſci.</hi> the conſolation, reproof, and inſtruction thereof, in Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, <hi>ſci.</hi> mutual ſupport both inward and outward; in Breaking of bread, thereby remembring the death of our Lord, whoſe ſoul was made an offering for ſin, as his fleſh is meat indeed, and his blood drink indeed, by the help of the Spirit, to nouriſh our ſouls and ſpirits up unto eternal life, and in prayer, one with and for another; And that this is the abſolute order which the Lord hath appointed in his laſt Will and Teſtament, doth evidently appear both by his own precept, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and by the practice of ſuch as firſt truſted in him, and if ſo, then neither infants of daies, nor yet ſuch as profeſs themſelves to be believers in Jeſus, but refuſe as a manifeſtation thereof, according to the practice of ſuch as firſt truſted in Chriſt, to yield up themſelves to be plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the death, burial, and reſurrection of Chriſt, and ſo viſibly to put Chriſt on, as did the Chriſtians of old, I ſay ſuch have no viſible right to enter into, or walk in the order of the Goſpel of Chriſt; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the point, the argument ſtands thus. They, and they only, have viſible right to enter into, and walk in the viſible order of Chriſts houſe, and ſo to wait for his comming, whom Chriſt Jeſus himſelf being the Lord of the houſe, hath appointed, and his Apoſtles being his ſtewards, have approved of; But ſuch as firſt have been taught and made diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples or Scholars of Jeſus, and believers in Chriſt, and afterwards have

bin baptiſed or dipped and therby viſibly &amp; lively planted into the death, burial, and reſurrection of Chriſt, are they, and they only, whom Chriſt hath appointed and the Apoſtles have approved of. See his Commiſſion, peruſe their practice; <hi>Ergo</hi> They, and they only, have viſible right to enter into, and walk in the order of Chriſts houſe, and ſo to wait for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the ſecond time, in the form of a King, with his glorious Kingdom, according to promiſe.

                  </gap>oul lacks, and that therfore they are to wait for this promiſe, and for theſe ſupplies in his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, will clearly appear.</p>
               <p>1. Out of the words of the Lord himſelf. See <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 15, 16,

               <p>If the conſequence be denied, it will ſtill be proved out of Chriſts own words; See <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. 37, 38. and the conſideration even in reaſon of Chriſts exceeding love and tender care towards all his diſciples that love him and keep his commandments, and their ſenſible wants of the ſame ſupplies of the Spirit will clearly evince it.</p>
               <p>2. It will clearly appear out of the words of the Apoſtles of Chriſt; See <hi>Iohns</hi> interpretation of theſe words of Chriſt, <hi>Out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of living water, This ſpake he</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iohn</hi>) <hi>of the Spirit which they that believe on him ſhould receive, for the holy Spirit was not yet, becauſe Ieſus was not yet glorified,</hi> John 7. 29. See alſo what they all ſay with one mouth, after they had received this holy Spirit with power, whereby they were furniſhed as Apoſtles or Embaſſadors (of him that had all power in heaven and earth in his hand) to go forth with the embaſſage of peace into all Nations, and could deliver the mind of their Lord unto them in their own language, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38, 39. <hi>Repent and be baptiſed every one of you in the name of Ieſus, for the remiſſion of ſins &amp; ye ſhall receive the gift of the holy Spirit, for the promiſe is to you, and to your children, and to all that are a far off, as many</hi> (of all theſe) <hi>as the Lord our God ſhall call, ſci.</hi> to repentance from dead works, to faith in Chriſt Ieſus, to this viſible manifeſtation thereof by being bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, and ſo viſibly planted into the death, buriall, and reſurrection of Chriſt for the remiſſion of ſins.</p>
               <p>3. This will alſo appear by the enjoyments of thoſe that firſt truſted in Chriſt, and viſibly manifeſted their faith and love in and to the Lord, by keeping his commandments: The Diſciples which were alſo called<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, waiting in the appointment of their Lord at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> received and were filled with that holy Spirit, with power according to promiſe.

See <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 4. compared with 2. 2. So that great number that were about three or rather five thouſand ſouls that believed through their word, and were baptized in Jeruſalem, and waited in the appointments of the ſame Lord, that is to ſay, <hi>together steadfastly in the Apoſtles doctrine, and in fellowſhip, and in breaking of bread, and in prayer,</hi> they alſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joied this holy Spirit according to promiſe. See <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 31. The like may be found among the Saints in <hi>Samaria, Acts</hi> 8. 17. in <hi>Epheſus, Acts</hi> 19. And the ſame may be found among the Saints that thus put on Chriſt, and walked in him, among thoſe that firſt truſted in him in all places.

In the third place is declared the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great countenance, and rich reward which this Lord will beſtow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a faithfull ſervant that hath thus improved his Talent, when he ſhall have received the Kingdome, and ſhall return in the glory of his Father; the countenance (I ſay) appears in theſe words, <hi>he will ſay, well,</hi> or as it is in the 25 of <hi>Matthew, well done thou good and faithful ſervant, thou haſt been faithful in a few things;</hi> the rich Reward appears in theſe, <hi>Enter into the joy of thy Lord, or have thou Authority</hi> (in my Kingdom) <hi>over ten Cities, be thou alſo ruler over five Cities, &amp;c.</hi> But to proceed.</p>
               <p>[<hi>And in the congregation he may either ask for information to himſelf</hi>] This was a liberty amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> in their ſynagogues or congregations, as appears <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 46. where Chriſt being about twelve years old, is found by his parents among the Doctors, in the Temple, not only hearing them, but asking them queſtions; and when he alſo taught in the Temple, or elſewhere, the people did not only hear him,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56389:42"/>
but asked him queſtions, yea made objections againſt what was delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, without interruption, and it cannot be conceived but this is much more a liberty in the congregations, and Churches of Chriſt; and therefore 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 35. where women are directed to ask their husbands at home if they will learn, and the reaſon is given becauſe it is a ſhame for them to ſpeak in the Church, it is plainly declared, that men that will learn may ask in the Church, for it is not a ſhame for them to ſpeak there. But to proceed.</p>
               <p>[<hi>Or if he can, he may ſpeak by way of prophecy for the edification, exhortation, and comfort of the whole</hi>] by prophecy here I mean a plain, and brief declaration of the mind, and counſel of God, in words ſignificantly and eaſie to be underſtood, confirmed by the words of the Apoſtles and Prophets of God, and brought forth for the edification, exhortation, and comfort of the whole; The 14 of the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> will plentifully clear this truth, and make this liberty good unto the Saints, in the Churches of Chriſt, and it cannot be ſhut out but by the ſpirit of Antichriſt. See <hi>verſe</hi> 1. 5. 12. 24. 26. 30, 31. 39, 40. So 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 19, 20. Quench not the Spirit, is the exhortation to him that is therby moved to ſpeak; and deſpiſe not prophecyings, is the exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them that are preſent to hear. But to proceed.</p>
               <p>[<hi>And out of the congregation at all times, upon all occaſions, and in all places, as far as the juriſdiction of his Lord extends</hi>] which is not only to the utmoſt parts of the Earth, but alſo to heaven. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 20, 21, 22.</p>
               <p>[<hi>May (yea ought to) walk as a Child of light, justifying wiſdome with her waies, and reproving folly with the unfruitful words ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, provided, &amp;c.</hi> For a warrant here, ſee <hi>Deu.</hi> 6. 7. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 14. 16. 10. 32, 33. 11. 19. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 11. <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 20. <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. 13. And ſo have I done alſo with the 3d. Concluſion, the fourth followeth.</p>
               <p>4. [<hi>I teſtify that no ſervant of Chriſt Jeſus hath any liberty, much leſs authority, from his Lord, to ſmite his Fellow-ſervant.</hi>] This will be evinced to be a truth many waies from the mouth of the Lord.</p>
               <p>1. In that it is the great commandment of this Lord to his diſciples, and ſervants, to love one another, and ſo to bear one anothers burdens, who ought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to have their love ſtronger than death, ſo as to lay down their lives for the bretheren. See <hi>John</hi> 13. 34. 15. 17. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 23. 4. 21. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 2. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. Now to ſmite one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56389:42"/>
is a breach of that Law of Love in a very high degree. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>2. The ſervants of Chriſt are called upon by their Lord to learn of him to be meek, and lowly, and are put thereby into a capacity to be further taught the way, and fear of the Lord, to increaſe their joy, and they are ſuch as ſhall inherit the earth, and alſo heaven, for they ſhall find reſt for their ſouls; and this meek, quiet and gentle Spirit is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Spirit of the Lord to be an ornament of very great price. See for a proof of all this <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 29. 21. 5. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 25. 9. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 29. 19. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 5. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 4. but to ſmite is an argument of a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineering, proud, and lofty ſpirit, which is far from a Spirit that is meek and lowly. Therefore.</p>
               <p>3. The ſervants of Chriſt are called upon by their Lord to be ſo far from ſmiting their fellows, that in caſe they ſhould be ſmitten by others for his, and the Goſpels ſake, meerly on one cheek, they ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther turn the other, than ſeek to revenge it. See <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 7. <hi>why do ye not rather take wrong</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>why do you not rather ſuffer your ſelves to be defrauded?</hi> but this is far from ſmiting one another. Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>4. This Lord being alſo that Prince of Peace, doth ſo far diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſuch practices as theſe among any ſervants of his, that belong to his houſe, that he hath abſolutely and expreſly declared, that he by no means will have a ſtriker to ſupply the Office of an Elder, or Steward therein, no nor one that is of a Lordly, or domineering ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, nor yet one that is froward, and will be ſoon angry. See in the firſt Epiſtle of <hi>Timothy</hi> 3. 3. <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Peter</hi> 5. 3. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>5. That no ſervant of Chriſt hath ſuch authority from his Lord to ſmite his fellows, doth plainly appear in that Parable <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 34. where it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord was ſo wroth that he will have that wicked ſervant delivered to the tormentors,</hi> that did but take his fellow by the throat; and him that fell to ſmiting his fellowes in his Lords ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 51. it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord ſhall come upon, in a day when he looked not for him, and in an hour that he is not awar of, and ſhall cut him aſunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrits, where ſhall be weeping, and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> But to proceed in the teſtimony, where it is ſaid,</p>
               <p>[<hi>No nor yet with outward force, or arm of fleſh to conſtrain, or</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:56389:43"/>
                  <hi>reſtrain anothers conſcience, nor yet his outward man for conſcience ſake, or worſhip of his God, &amp;c.</hi>] That this is a truth will be made out by the Scriptures of truth, and that many waies. The firſt argument to prove it ſtandeth thus.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Arg.</hi> If any Servant of Chriſt Jeſus (be he high, or low, rich, or poor) have any ſuch liberty, or authority from his Lord ſo to do, then he is able to ſhew it, (as that which may be his warrant ſo to act) either out of the words of the Lord himſelf, or out of thoſe that were ſpoken, or writ by the Apoſtles, which were his Ambaſſadors, and were furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their Lord with commands for his Servants obſervance until he come again.</p>
               <p>But no ſervant of Chriſt (I ſuppoſe) is able to ſhew, either out of his own words, or out of the words of the Apoſtles, any ſuch liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or authori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y from the Lord, as that which may be his warrant ſo to do. Therfore.</p>
               <p>The firſt Propoſition cannot be denyed, which is this, If any ſervant of Chriſt Jeſus have any ſuch authority from his Lord, he is able to ſhew it, either out of his own words, or from the Apoſtles. And indeed for a man to act in the name of the Lord, and not to have a word, or warrant from him, is high preſumption, and ſo will it appear if theſe theſe things be conſidered.</p>
               <p>1. In that it is plainly declared, <hi>That all power in heaven, and in earth, is given unto</hi> Chriſt, and therefore muſt all authority in heaven, and in earth, be derived from him; and hence it is, that it concerns the feet and the toes of that great image, if it be poſſible, to ſtand clear of him who is that little ſtone cut out without hands, and ſhall ere long become great mountain, and fill the Earth.</p>
               <p>2. In that it is as plainly declared, that the living God hath in theſe laſt daies ſpoken by Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1. hath made him the heir of all things, and thereupon hath called upon every one that hath an ear to hear him, hath threatned that ſoul that will not hear him that he ſhal be cut of; therfore it concerns every ſervant of his to take heed he uſe no ſuch authority over another which he hath not heard and received from Chriſt.</p>
               <p>3. In that it is declared that Chriſt Jeſus the Lord is that one law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, and that they are bleſſed that do his commandements, yea, ſo bleſſed, that the Apoſtle ſaith he is become the author of eternall ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to thoſe that obey him, and that he is alſo the Judge unto whom
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56389:43"/>
the living God, hath appointed a great, and notable, and terrible day, in which and by whom he will <hi>Judge the world in righteouſneſs,</hi> yea, the very ſecrets of mens hearts, according to his goſpel. See <hi>James</hi> 4. 12. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 9. <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 42. and 17. 31. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 16. From which conſideration it alſo appears, that it concerns the ſervants of Chriſt, that they deſpiſe not ſuch a Law-giver and ſuch a Judge as he is, in taking ſuch liberty, or exerciſing ſuch authority, over other mens conſciences, which cannot be made out from his words that he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them; all which, as ſo many arguments, will prove the firſt propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>And as for the ſecond, which is this, <hi>ſci.</hi> No ſervant of Chriſt can ſhew a warrant from Chriſt for ſuch an authority, either out of his own words, or his Apoſtles; if that be denied, we muſt then call for the warrant, which muſt be ſhewed either out of the Evangeliſts, the book of the Acts of the Apoſtles, the Apoſtles Epiſtles, or the Revelation of Jeſus: but I ſuppoſe it cannot be ſhewn out of any of theſe. If the 13. of the <hi>Romans</hi> be produced for a warrant, no man can deny that the power there ſpoken of was ſuch as belonged to a heathen, and I think no man will acknowledge that he had ſuch an authority from Chriſt to order mens conſciences, or outward man, with reſpect to the worſhip of God, and therefore that word cannot be their warrant.</p>
               <p>If the words of <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 5. 12. I would they were cut off that trouble you, be produceed for a warrant, let the words be conſidered (and in the firſt place) there is no mention made of outward force, or outward affliction, and therefore no warrant for any outward or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall hand ſo to afflict; but 2. The words were ſpoken to the Churches in <hi>Ga atia,</hi> which were ſpirit all ſocieties, and concerning ſpirituall tranſgreſſors, and therefore their cutting off muſt be from that ſpirituall relation and union which hitherto they enjoyed, and how that is done, compare 3. <hi>Acts</hi> 23. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 8. 17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 17. 19. 20. 22. And the carnall cutting off from the carnall <hi>Iſrael</hi> (before the time of reformation) was but a type of this ſpirituall cutting off and caſting out from the ſpirituall <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God ſince.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, conſider, the words were ſpoken by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who would have us to know (as he declares it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4.) that the weapons of his warfare were not carnall, he was not wont to ſtrive with them that oppoſed themſelves with carnall weapons, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if he ſpeaks to ſuch perſons as theſe <hi>Galatians</hi> were (that had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſuch power from the Lord) touching a cutting off, which is a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that belongs to a ſword, it would be too carnall an underſtanding
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56389:44"/>
of the place to conceive that this ſhould be done by any other ſword, than by the ſword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, and can reach to their Spirits, and is the only offenſive weapon the Saints are to take in ſuch caſes as this againſt their ſpirituall oppoſers; and ſo have I done with the firſt Argument. A ſecond, to evince this, is taken from that law wherewith Chriſt Jeſus, that Sonne of Righteouſneſs, hath more or leſs enlightned the Nations, which I may therefore call the law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, being that law by which the Lord will Judge thoſe which may otherwiſe be ſaid to be without law: the Law is this, Do, as thou wouldſt be done unto, which is alſo (as Chriſt ſpeaks) the Law and the Prophets. The argument ſtandeth thus.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Arg.</hi> If every ſervant of Chriſt Jeſus have a commandement from his Lord, as he will anſwer it before him when he ſhall appear as Judge, to do to others, as he would have others to do unto him; then no ſervant of his can have either liberty or authority from him thus to force ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans conſcience, or his outward man meely for conſcience ſake.</p>
               <p>But every ſervant of Chriſt hath this command from his Lord, <hi>viz.</hi> Do to others as ye would that others ſhould do unto you. Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The ſecond propoſition is undeniable. See 7. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 31. The conſequence of the firſt propoſition can ſcarce be denied, but if any ſhould raſhly deny it, then I appeal to that mans conſcience, not being ſeared, which alſo knows but in part, in the fight &amp; preſence of God, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he can be willing that another who is further informed in the things of God, and is alſo ſtronger than he (whether he can be willing, I ſay, that he) ſhould by ſuch a force conſtrain or reſtrain his conſcience, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in ſmaller differences, but how much leſs in things that do ſo vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly differ.</p>
               <p>3 <hi>Arg.</hi> The third argument ſtandeth thus.</p>
               <p>If Chriſt Jeſus the Lord inſtructed his ſervants to be meek, lowly, and gentle, yea, kind and curteous to all; ſent forth the chiefeſt of them, and told them that they ſhould be as lambs in the midſt of wolves; yea, holds them and us, and all that ſhall reign with Chriſt, when he ſhall appear with his Kingdome, in a continuall expectation of a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted and afflicted condition in this preſent evil world, then it cannot be expected that they ſhould have any ſuch liberty, much leſs authority, from him thus to perſecute, proſecute, or inforce others.</p>
               <p>But the firſt is true. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 29. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 4. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 34. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 3. 12. All that will live Godly in Chriſt Jeſus (ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> who well diſcerned the ſpirit that was abroad, &amp; that which ſhould remain and increaſe in the world) ſhall ſuffer perſecution, and,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56389:44"/>
theſervant is not greater than his Lord, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 24, 25 So that by this it appears, that the firſt is true, and therefore the ſecond which is this, <hi>That no ſervant of Christ can expect any ſuch liberty or authority from his Lord thus to perſecute, proſecute, or inforce others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Fourth argument againſt forcing men againſt their conſciences' in the things, and worſhip of God, is taken from the nature of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of man, and of the worſhip of God, which are both ſpiritual; and it ſtandeth thus.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Arg.</hi> That which the Lord hath reſerved in his own hand, and hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to mannage as part of his own Kingdome by his own power or Spirit, and by another manner of miniſtery, and ſword, than that which is put forth in the Kingdoms of men, his being ſuch as fuits with the underſtanding and conſcience of man, as it's a ſpiritual thing, and with the worſhip of God, which is alſo ſpiritual, that, I ſay, can no ſervant of Chriſt have authority from him, by an other ſword, or arm of fleſh, to undertake, mannage, or think to effect.</p>
               <p>But the Lord hath reſerved this great work of ordering the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and conſcience, which is the ſpirit of man, by way of conſtraint, or reſtraint; and alſo the outward man, with reſpect to the worſhip of God, I ſay, he hath reſerved this great work, in his own hand, and in the hand of the Spirit, and hath intended to mannage it as a part of his Kingdome, by his own Spirit, and by another manner of miniſtery, than that which is put forth in the Kingdoms of men. Therfore, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The firſt propoſition, I judge, cannot be denyed, becauſe if it be by him reſerved in his own hand and power, then by his authority it cannot be in the hand of another; and if intended by him to be man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by another manner of miniſtery and ſword, than that which is put forth in the Kingdomes of men, then not by the ſame.</p>
               <p>And as for the ſecond, it will appear to be a truth by theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing teſtimonies.</p>
               <p>1. That the great work of ordering the underſtanding and conſcience, which is the ſpirit of a man, by way of conſtraint or reſtraint; and alſo the outward man, with reſpect to the worſhip of God, is reſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (as a part of his Kingdome, the ſpirits of men being the throne of the Lord) in his own hand, and in the hand of the Spirit, doth appear <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 26. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 32. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 22. <hi>Zach.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 6. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 5. 10. 1. 9. <hi>Luke</hi> 24 45. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 18, 19. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 47. 11. 21. And</p>
               <p>2. That he hath intended to mannage it by another manner of ſword, or miniſtery, than that which is put forth in the Kingdoms of men, is
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56389:45"/>
alſo evident, in that he did neirher ſpeak to, nor yet make uſe of the Kings of the earth to make him diſcipies, nor yet call for their ſword to conſtrain them or others to the worſhip of God, or to reſtrain them from their own, although it was performed to dumb Idols, and ſo unto devils; but made uſe of the ſword of the Spirit, which is his own word, &amp; the miniſtery of his Apoſtles, and ſervants, to hold it forth to the world, and tl ereby were diſciples made unto him, and ſo by him brought from their own to the worſhip and ſervice of God. See <hi>lo.</hi> 16. 8, 9, 10, 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 26. <hi>Acts</hi> 15 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 18. 1 <hi>The.</hi> 1. 8, 9. ch. 2. 13. <hi>Heb</hi> 4 12.</p>

               <p>But by outward force to ſeek to conſtrain, or reſtrain an others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in the worſhip of God, &amp;c. doth preſuppoſe one man to have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over another mans conſcience, and is but to force ſervants, and worſhippers upon the Lord, which he ſeeks not for, and is the ready way to make men diſſemblers and hypocrites, and to put them upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faning the name of the Lord.

This is but a forcing of ſervants and worſhipers upon the Lord, and I ſay at the beſt, for it is more likely to force worſhipers from him; And this will cleerly appear, becauſe the true worſhipers, and ſuch as the fathe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeeks for, are ſuch as worſhip him in Spirit, and in Truth: See <hi>John</hi> 4. 23, 24. who having received from Chriſt the Spirit of life and love, have his word ſtand in their heart, as the word of a King, ſo that thereby they become a willing people to do him ſervice, and ſtand not in need of ſuch outward force to compell them thereto; they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that ſtand in need to be, and therefore are by outward force com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to the worſhip of God, to the faith and order of the goſpel of Chriſt (they I ſay) are ſuch ſervants, and worſhipers, as are forc'd upon the Lord, whom he ſeeks not for.</p>
               <p>This outward forcing men in the worſhip of God, is the ready way to make men diſſemblers and hypocrites before God, and men which wiſe men abhor; the truth of this will be thus demonſtrated; for if they be ſpirituall, true, and willing worſhipers, ſuch as the Father ſeeks for, then what need is there of a conſtraint or reſtraint? ſuch are a law of life to themſelves; but if they be not, then what make they there before him, who calls for the heart, and wiſheth men to look to their ſpirits, for he is a Spirit, and will be ſanctified of all thoſe that draw neer unto him? See <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 26. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. 3, 4. Then as they are forced upon the Lord againſt his will, and without any warrant from him, ſo are they alſo againſt their own, and therefore although their bodies may be preſent, and through fear of the ſtroke, or hope of reward, may ſeem to conform, yet their hearts and minds not being changed (and the ſtrong holds thereof not being beaten down, as by ſuch carnall weapons they are never likely to be) they I ſay, are abſent, and far from the Lord; ſo then, while their hearts, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fciences, ſtill cleave to their Idols, and yet their bodies are cauſed to conform, what is this but to make men diſſemblers and hypocrites before
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56389:46"/>
God and man? and that it is the way to put men upon the profaning the name of the Lord, is alſo evident; underſtand by name his attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, word, ordinances, worſhip, they are all profaned by ſuch a perſon that ſtands in need to be forc'd to Religion. See <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 13, for him to call upon the name of the Lord, is to profane the name of the Lord, for their prayers are abomination to him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 26. <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 9. <hi>Iſay</hi> 1. 13. And a calling the name of God or Chriſt upon ſuch, is counted by him a blaſpheming his name. See <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 9. 13. 1. 5, 6. and unto the wicked ſaith God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 16. <hi>What haſt thou to do to declare my statutes, or to take my Co<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enant in thy mouth, Seeing thou hatest instruction, and caſtest my words behind thee?</hi> By all which it doth evidently appear, that the ſecond propoſition doth alſo ſtand firm.</p>
               <p>A ſixt argument againſt the forcing of men againſt their underſtandings and conſciences, is taken from the prohibition of Chriſt, and ſtands thus.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>Arg.</hi> If Chriſt Ieſus the Lord hath expreſly forbidden his ſervants by ſuch a force to ſeek to conſtrain or reſtrain another mans conſcience, or his outward man againſt his underſtanding and conſcience, in things appertaining to God, although his underſtanding and conſcience be cleerly diſcerned to be erronious and evil, then can no ſervant of Chriſt Jeſus have any liberty, much leſs authority, from him ſo to practiſe; This cannot be denied.</p>
               <p>But Chriſt Jeſus the Lord hath expreſly forbidden his ſervants ſo to practiſe, and for the proof hereof, take two or three inſtances, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 14. where Chriſt ſpeaking to his diſciples, touching the Phariſees, who were blind guides, ſeducers, hypocrites, ſtrong oppoſers of Chriſt, yet ſeemingly full of zeal and devotion, and ſuch as brought a vanity upon the worſhip of God, and made his commandements of none ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect by their traditions, as appears, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. of the ſame chapter, yet <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g> 14. ſaith Chriſt to his diſciples, let them alone, they are blind, leaders of the blind, and ſo leaves them to that ſad event, which is, their falling into the ditch, or periſhing together.

I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce but one inſtanee more to ſhew that our Lord Jeſus forbids ſuch a practice as this among his Diſciples or ſervants, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 24, 25, 26. <hi>The ſer<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ant of the L Lord,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> in the word of the Lord, <hi>muſt not strive, but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach,</hi> not to ſtrike, <hi>patient in meekneſs, instructing thoſe that oppoſe themſel<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>es;</hi> which word ſignifieth a ſetting a mans ſelf in an oppoſition to the truth in a more than an ordinary manner, even by way of covenant or reſolution of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, yet are they ſtill to be waiting with meekneſs upon them, <hi>if God at any time will gi<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>e them repentance to the acknowledgement of the truth, that they may reco<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>er themſel<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>es out of the ſnares of the de<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>il, who are taken capti<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>e by him at his will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another argument that there can be no warrant from Chriſt for ſuch a practice as this, is taken from ſuch expreſſions of his, wherein he ſhews his diſlike thereof, and it ſtandeth thus.</p>
               <p>7. <hi>Arg.</hi> If Chriſt Jeſus the Lord have ſharply reproved and check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſervants when he hath eſpied ſuch a ſpirit as this but breaking forth in them, then can no ſervant of his have any countenance, much leſs authority from him ſo to practiſe.</p>
               <p>But the firſt is true, he hath ſharply reproved them when he eſpied
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56389:47"/>
ſuch a ſpirit as this but breaking forth, witneſs his words <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 24 25. <hi>&amp;c.

               <p>The laſt Argument ſtandeth thus.</p>
               <p>8. <hi>Arg.</hi> That which of it ſelf is inconſiſtent with the civil peace, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, proſperity, and ſafety of a Place, Commonwealth, or nation, no ſervant of Chriſt Jeſus can have liberty, much leſs authority from his Lord to do</p>
               <p>But this outward forcing of men in matters of conſcience towards God to believe as others believe, and to practiſe and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> worſhip as others do, cannot ſtand with the Peace, Liberty, Proſperity, and ſafety of a Place, Commonwealth, or nation. Therefore no ſervant of Chriſt can have any liberty, much leſs authority ſo to do.</p>
               <p>The firſt propoſition can ſcarce be denyed if theſe things be conſidered, <hi>ſci.</hi> That Chriſt Jeſus the Lord is the Prince of Peace, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9 6 <hi>Heb<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </gap>elf cannot ſtand with the peace and proſperity of a place, and nation, that can no ſervant of Chriſt have by the authority of this Lord, unleſs by a juſt judgement from him upon the rulers of this world for giving their power, and ſword, to the beaſt, thus to be abuſed and made drunk with the blood of the Saints, which his tender heart cannot but avenge upon themſelves, and upon the Nations for their loving to have it ſo.</p>
               <p>And as for the ſecond Propoſition, which is this, that this outward forcing of men in matters of conſcience towards God to believe as others believe, and to practiſe and worſhip, not as themſelves (but as others) are perſwaded, cannot ſtand with the peace, liberty, proſperity, and ſafety of a Place, Nation, and Commonwealth; this will as plainly appear in the examination of each particular thereof.</p>
               <p>And firſt, it cannot ſtand with the peace of a Commonwealth; for as there could be no peace expected in the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, ſo long as that harlot <hi>Jezabel</hi> (who thirſted after innocent blood) could at her pleaſure obtain the ſeal and power of the King, to effect her bloody deſign upon the ſervants of the Lord, who withſtood her Idolatrous Prieſts, and that Idolatrous way and worſhip which they had ſet up, ſo likewiſe as long as that ſpirituall <hi>Jezabell</hi> among thoſe that account themſelves the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> of God, (who is ſeen in <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 3. to ride upon that ſcarlet-colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beaſt, and to own her ſelf as the City and ſpouſe of that great King, the King of Saints, ſo long I ſay as ſhe) can by her glorious deckings and ſplendours, ſo deceive and allure the Kings and Rulers of the earth, to commit fornication with her, and to give their ſword and power to the beaſt that bears her up, there can be no expectation of peace in the earth, but ſtill of wars, and rumours of wars, untill mens hearts fail them: for ſo long as there is an outward force or power to be had to maintain and uphold the carnall intereſts and advantages of ſome upon religious accounts, and to perſecute others, who for conſcience ſake towards God, dare not, yea cannot conform to their way, What hopes are hereby begotten and nouriſhed in ſome? what jealouſies, ſuſpicions and fears in others? what revengfull deſires in moſt? yea, what plottings and contrivings in all? and as a fruit and effect hereof, what riding? running? troubleſome, and tumultuous aſſemblings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
