         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THere hath bin a Printed Paper lately publiſhed under the Title of a Declaration of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsary Generall <hi>Bhar,</hi> for his vindication of diverſe diſhonourable Calumnies, which he ſhould have expreſſed, highly to the prejudice of both Nations in ſundry particalars, The proofe of which, we leave to thoſe Honourable Perſons, whoſe reputation is of that value, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the influence theſe barbarous lines hath upon them, as ſcornes to admit any compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with the baſeneſse of the ſubſcriber.</p>
            <p>In which Paper it is to be obſerved, That Commiſsary Generall <hi>Bhar,</hi> [in all his actions like himſelfe] whereas he ſhould haue vindicated his Honour by his Sword [my Lord <hi>Denbigh</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving adorned him with all the Ornaments of a <hi>Pultrone,</hi> as is to be ſeene under his hand and Seale, did ſend a Letter of complement to the Earle, thinking his Lordſhip (having ſo prodigal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affronted him before, would have returned one Anſwer ſutable to his Letter: but my Lord, truly Noble, perfectly ſcorn'd it, and made his <hi>Major</hi> returne him this.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Sir, the Earle of Denbigh bid me let you know, that what he ſpoke or wrote, or shall ſpeake or write, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning you, he will Juſtifie, avouch, and maintaine.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>This Major was neither Peere, nor Parliament man, ſo that <hi>Bhar</hi> might have put him to it; ſince his pretence was, he could not challenge a Peere of the Land, but it is well knowne, my Lord <hi>Denbigh</hi> is of ſuch Gallantry, that he would wave any Priviledge what ſoever, for the reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the bleeding Honour of a Gentleman.</p>
            <p>In the end of his Declaration, he ſubjoynes as followeth.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>But of all theſe Calumnies and Lyes in generall, I am bound to ſay, that they are invented, forged, and vented by men, ill affected to the common good; who for ſiniſter ends, endeavour to ſowe diviſion, and to rend in ſunder the happy union of the two Nations, of which ravelling, ſome beginnings are already diſcovered in diverſe Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, who have laid downe their Commisſions, in his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies Army, upon no other ground, but that it ſtandeth not with their Honour, to ſerve where the robber of their Nations honour is tolerated.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>Obſerve; <hi>Bhar</hi> would not challenge a Peere, and yet here he renders himſelfe ſo conſiderable, that thoſe whom he ſeares would queſtion him guiltie, are ſowers of Sedition, and Renters of the Vnion betwixt the two Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>He accuſes ſome Officers of ravelling, who for just reaſons have layd downe their Commiſſions; and yet all this time his carriage to theſe Gentlemen hath been ſo ſubmiſſively humble, that it can deſerve no other Title but Sycophanticall baſeneſſe.</p>
            <p>He never had the courage to reſent it, otherwiſe, then by ſtealing up a thing called a Declaration (his Perſon that day being inviſible) thinking thereby to free himſelfe of theſe just Titles, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly put upon him in the Earle of <hi>Denbighes</hi> Letter, where he ſtands registred upon record, a moſt notorious Pultrone, a baſe and unworthy way to cloake his Cowardize: As who would ſtab a man behind, not daring to make appeare any former reſentment. But the Gentleman is wiſe, he hath choſen the beſt of two evils; Not knowing otherwiſe how to avoyd perſonall hazard, but by throwing himſelfe in the hand of Iustice, where (hee knowes) wee muſt leave him to his merited reward, which we doubt not time will ſuddenly bring forth.</p>
