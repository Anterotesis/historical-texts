            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE great Convoy of Proviſions being arrived in the Camp from <hi>Dublin,</hi> under the Guard of the Earl of <hi>Portland</hi>'s Regiment of Horſe, the whole Army paſſed the <hi>Shannon</hi> on the 12th of <hi>July,</hi> about 11 in the Morning, the Horſe by two Fords, and the Foot and Artillery over the Bridge of <hi>Athlone</hi>; ſome of the Enemies Squadrons ſhewed themſelves on the Hills, but we quickly drove them from thence, with two Squadrons of Horſe; and two of Dragoons: And having afterwards viewed the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Camp, and the Ground which we might poſſeſs our ſelves of between two Bogs, we found that half our Army could not Encamp there, which obliged us to begin our Camp on the Right, in order to extend it as far as we were able on the Left. But the Enemy having poſſeſſed themſelves of a Paſs on the Left, in the middle of a Bog, it was thought neceſſary to force them from thence; The Regiment of Blue Dragoons, a Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of the Dragoons of <hi>Cunninghame,</hi> and the Regiment of my Lord <hi>Portland</hi> was De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached for this Service.</p>
            <p>The Enemy ſeeing them advance, and that but a ſmall part of our Army was yet come up, ſent ſome Foot and Horſe through the Bog; upon which the blew Dragoons diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted, and repulſed them. The Enemy detached divers Battalions and Squadrons to ſupport their Men; and the Prince of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> with two of his Battalions came very opportunely to the Aſſiſtance of ours, and gave time to the reſt of the Troops of his Wings to come up. This obliged the Enemy to retire to their main Body, who were poſted on a great Hill, ſurrounded almoſt on all ſides with Bogs, and having a Caſtle on their left, it was reſolved to attack them there; in order whereunto our Foot paſſed through a Bog, many of them up to the middle, receiving the ſire from 3 of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Retrenchments; and our Horſe, notwithſtanding of their continual Fire, having paſſed the Defilè, the two Armies about ſix in the evening were intirely engaged at a place called <hi>Aghram</hi> near <hi>Bellinaſloe</hi>; The Fight was very ſharp, and laſted about three hours; our Men being obliged to Attack them from Trench to Trench, which they had thrown up for their greater ſecurity. The Iriſh were never known to Fight with more Reſolution, eſpecially their Foot, Their Army was Superiour to ours in number, conſiſting of 20000 Foot, and 8000 Horſe and Dragoons, and had all the advantage imaginable by the ſituation of the Ground; but it pleaſed God to bleſs their Majeſties Forces with an intire Victory, their whole Body being broke and diſperſed: Of the Enemy there are above 5000 killed upon the place, of which number are the Lord <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moy,</hi> Colonel <hi>Moor,</hi> with many others; and as ſome Deſerters report, their <hi>French</hi> General St. <hi>Ruth.</hi> Major-General <hi>Hamilton,</hi> Colonel <hi>Dorington,</hi> Lord <hi>Slane,</hi> Lord <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi> Colonel <hi>Butler,</hi> Colonel <hi>Bourke,</hi> Colonel <hi>Gordon,</hi> Colonel <hi>O-Neile,</hi> and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſons of Note are Priſoners; and had it not been for the coming on of the Night, all their Foot would have been cut off.</p>
            <p>We took all the Enemies Baggage, Tents, Proviſion and Cannon, which latter conſiſted only of nine Pieces: On our ſide we loſt about 500 Men; Major-General <hi>Holeſtaple</hi> and Colonel <hi>Herbert</hi> are killed; the Prince of <hi>Heſſe</hi> and the Lord <hi>Cuts,</hi> wounded. The Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and Courage of our Men in this Occaſion, exceeded all the Account that can be given of them; and the Vigour and Conduct of the General Officers, contributed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly to this great and glorious Victory. The General has ſent a Detachment to At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack <hi>Portumny,</hi> where the Enemy have a great Magazine of Proviſions.</p>
