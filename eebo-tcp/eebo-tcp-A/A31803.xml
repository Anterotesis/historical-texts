            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Votes and Declarations of

ſeverall informations of evident
and imminent danger unto Our
Kingdome, <hi>from enemies abroad,</hi> and <hi>at home,</hi> and
finding that Our Commiſsions of Lieutenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
(although Wee did ſince the beginning of this
Parliament grant the like for the County of <hi>Yorke,</hi>
to the now Earle of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> with the privitie of
both Our Houſes of Parliament, and without
exception from either; and that the ſame was
the meanes for defence of this Kingdome uſed
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43196:3"/>
in the happy times of that good Queene <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi>
and Our bleſſed Father, and confirmed as
well by the opinions of Iudges and Lawyers, as
the univerſall obedience of the Subjects) were
all of them,without hearing any of Our Councell
learned, voted illegall, and by Our Houſe of Peers
called in to be cancelled; And that thereupon Our
Kingdome lay open and expoſed to all dangerous
attempts without other proviſion then of a late
pretended Ordinance of both Our ſaid Houſes;
which (being made without Vs, and contrary to
Our expreſſe will declared, and after it had beene
twice refuſed in Our Houſe of Peeres, and after
the departure of a major part of the Peeres) was
ſo farre from being a meanes to prevent danger,
that if it ſhould have beene admitted, it would in
all probabilitie, have beene the ready way to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,
and ruine, as being made in an unparlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary,
unpreſidented, and unjuſtifiable way,
and therefore of a moſt dangerous conſequence,
both to Vs and Our people, as well in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
as in the Example.</p>
            <p>Wee did therefore for the avoyding of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill
of delayes, and expence of time in diſputes,
iſſue forth ſuch Our ſeverall Commiſſions of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray
into Our ſeverall Counties, as upon great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
Wee conceive were not only ſecured for, but
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43196:3"/>
alſo might well be moſt ſatisfactory unto both
Our Houſes, as being beyond all juſt exception
in the point of Legality, Danger, or Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
the ſame having beene heretofore moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately
agreed upon, and ſettled (as Wee ſhall
herein ſhew) in, and by the care and wiſedome
of the Parliament, held in the fifth yeare of King
<hi>Henry</hi> the fourth.</p>
            <p>And Wee expected for this Our ſo Princely care
of Our People, and obſervance of Our Lawes, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the dutifull thanks of both Our Houſes, then
the returne of ſuch an Anſwer or Declaration as
cauſeleſly imputes to this Our ſo well intended
and juſtifiable an act, not onely (upon miſ-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
and miſ-application of ſeverall Acts and
Declarations in Parliament) the taxe of illegality,
but alſo marketh it (upon the miſ-repreſentation
of divers powers, and omiſsion of divers Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in Our Commiſsion) with the brand of
extream danger, and inconvenience thereby to
Our people, and of an heavier yoke of Bondage
then either that of the late Ship money, or any
other charge taken away this Parliament.</p>
            <p>In all which, for the better and further ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of Our well-affected people, and to ſave
them (if poſsible) from incurring any danger ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by obeying that Ordinance, or diſobeying
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43196:4"/>
Our Commiſsions, (in both which We are reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to require a ſtrict examination and account)
We have taken the pains to examine the ſaid De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
and the Objections therein againſt Our
Commiſsions.</p>
            <p>And for the better understanding of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
particular doubts which are now raiſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
We hold it neceſſary in the firſt place, to ſet
forth the true end of theſe Commiſsions, with
the ſeverall Powers and Limitations thereof,
which by this Declaration are drawne into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
together with the ſeverall miſ-repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
thereof in this Declaration.</p>
            <p>The Subjects being of three ſorts; Some ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
good eſtates, and able bodies; Others, being
of good eſtates, but impotent; Others, able of
body, but not in eſtate: And the ſervice requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
being for the neceſſary defence of our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
in generall, in the time of danger.</p>
            <p>The Commiſſioners are to cauſe thoſe of the
firſt ſort, to Arme themſelves according to their
degree and eſtate, (and ſerving in Perſon, they
are not bound by this Commiſsion to find Arms
for any others.)</p>
            <p>Thoſe who (having eſtates) are not able to
ſerve in Perſon, are to be aſſeſſed, and may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to finde Arms for others, according to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43196:4"/>
the quantity of their Lands and Goods; But with
this Limitation, <hi>prout rationabiliter portare pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt,
&amp; ſalvo ſtatu ſuo;</hi> that is, That they be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
but moderately, and ſo as they may live ſtill,
according to their former condition.</p>
            <p>As for thoſe of the third ſort, who are not able
to Arm themſelves, by this Commiſsion, as it was
altered by common conſent in 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4. (for it was
otherwiſe before that time) they are not (as to
this matter of Arming) medled withall.</p>
            <p>And therefore this part of the Commiſsion is
miſ-repreſented in the Declaration. Which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
a Power given by this Commiſsion, to
charge all men <hi>without diſtinction,</hi> with Arms, <hi>at
the diſcretion of</hi> the Commiſsioners, <hi>without Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation;</hi>
and thoſe that are able, <hi>to finde Arms;</hi>
and ſuch as are impotent, <hi>to finde men at Arms,</hi>
according to the quantity of their Lands and
Goods; And alſo wholly omits the manner of
the charging them, which is <hi>to be moderately, and
ſo as they may ſtill live, according to their former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Commiſsion having thus, with equality,
and indifferency, charged Our Subjects with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
of Arms, it further provides for their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
together, training, and exerciſing, not (as it
is in the Declaration) generally <hi>at the pleaſure of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43196:5"/>
the Commiſsioners, without reſtraint either of time or
place:</hi>) But that they ſhall be called together, <hi>ad
certos dies &amp; loca quos videritis magis competentes
&amp; expedientes, &amp; pro populo noſtro minùs damnoſos;</hi>
At ſuch times and places as the Commiſsioners
ſhall thinke to be moſt fitting and expedient, and
leaſt hurtfull unto the people.</p>
            <p>And having thus provided, for the Arming
and preparing Our Subjects for defence of the
Kingdome; In the new place, the Commiſsion
gives power to the Commiſsioners, to leade them
to the Sea-coaſt, or elſe-where; but not <hi>at the
pleaſure of the Commiſsioners,</hi> (as may be inferred
out of the Declaration) nor <hi>without Limitation,</hi>
(though omitted alſo in the Declaration) But
the Commiſsion provides, That they are to be
led to the Sea-coaſt, or elſe-where, <hi>ubi ac quoties
neceſſe fuerit ad inimicos noſtros expellend. debelland.
&amp; deſtruend. cum periculum immineat;</hi> At ſuch
times and places as it ſhall be neceſſary for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion,
vanquiſhing, and deſtruction of Our
Enemies, when there ſhall be imminent danger.
And it further provides, in another part of the
Commiſsion, That they ſhall be conducted; <hi>cum
periculum imminuerit in defenſione Regni &amp; Patriae
tam ad Coſterum Maris, quàm alia loca ubi magis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
fuerit,</hi> In caſe of imminent danger, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43196:5"/>
of the Kingdome and Countrey from time
to time, as well to the Sea-coaſt, as other places
where it ſhall be moſt neceſſary.</p>
            <p>And although notwithſtanding all theſe limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
and cautions, it be true, That in this charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Arms, as alſo for the times and places of
calling together Our Subjects, and of conducting
or leading them, and the dangers upon which
they are to be ſo conducted and led, much is left
to the diſcretion of the Commiſsioners (as it
muſt of neceſsity in all Commiſsions, where the
places, times, and occaſions of execution of them
depend upon future accidents and circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and cannot be certainly knowne, or deſcribed
at the time of the iſſuing of the Commiſsions.)
Yet nevertheleſſe it cannot be inferred thereupon,
That therefore Our Commiſsioners have a meere
abſolute arbitrary Liberty of Will to doe what
they pleaſe. But that if they ſhall wilfully and
unjuſtly grieve any of Our good Subjects, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
or not obſerving Our Limitations or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,
they are, by Law, clearely puniſhable
by Indictment for the ſame: Nor are, or ſhall
any of Our Subjects ſo grieved, be without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
or reliefe.</p>
            <p>And to the end that every County, ſo farre as
in Vs lyeth, ſhould have cauſe to reſt the more aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43196:6"/>
againſt any evill uſage and abuſe; By this
Commiſſion Wee have appointed for Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners,
ſuch as have eſtates in the ſeverall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and are Perſons of Honour and Reputation,
who are not onely engaged to all fairneſſe out of
their owne intereſt, but alſo in the concernment
of their Poſterity, Kindred, Alliance, Friends, and
Tenants, and the good affection of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
which to Perſons of ſuch Condition as they
are, is of a conſideration beyond their Fortunes;
So that Wee hope their forwardneſſe in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
this trouble for the publike defence, will
occaſion in Our good Subjects, rather a willing
obedience unto Vs, then the leaſt diſtruſt or jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie
of any of them.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſtated the ſubſtance of Our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion,
and prevented that miſ-underſtanding,
which this Declaration might have elſe begotten
thereupon; Wee (in the neceſſary juſtification
thereof, and vindication of Our owne Honour,
againſt thoſe expreſsions in that Declaration,
which ſo nearely doe concerne Vs (under the
Common name of Evill Councellors) as if Wee
had violated Our Lawes, even thoſe ſo lately
made; broken Our often Proteſtations of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
according to Law, and done that which
would bring Our people into a ſlavery) ſhall
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43196:6"/>
now joyne iſſue with Our two Houſes, in every
materiall part of their Declaration, both in the
conſideration of the pretended Danger, Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency,
and Illegality.</p>
            <p>And herein, firſt, for the pretended Danger, and
Inconveniency ſo much urged; Wee do deny.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That this Commiſsion is full of Danger, or Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency
to Our Subjects, or will bring an heavier
Yoke of Bondage then the Ship-money, or any other
illegall charge, taken away this Parliament; or indeed,
any Danger or Inconvenience at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therein Wee appeale to each good mans
conſcience and reaſonable underſtanding: In a
Kingdome (as this is) which in its fundamentall
policy (as well for its owne aſſurance, againſt the
danger of Forraigne Aids, as the bad uſe that
might bee made of great conſtant Forces (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
forraigne or native) muſt neceſſarily be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
by it ſelfe: What other way of defence
can be imagined but by the Subject? What more
reaſonable proportion of charging them can bee
found? Wherein can the Limitation of the (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
Arbitrary) Diſcretion be bettered? Or how,
in any one particular, can a more equall &amp; fitting
way be taken for the avoyding the grieving Our
good Subjects in their own particulars? Yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
providing for the defence of our Kingdome
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43196:7"/>
in the generall, then is by this Commiſsion?</p>
            <p>And Wee cannot but profeſſe Our Wonder,
That ſince (as Wee ſhall ſhew) this very Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion
was with ſo much care, both in reſpect
<hi>of the Commiſsioners,</hi> and <hi>the powers of execution
thereof, over the perſons to be commanded,</hi> allowed,
and ſetled in all points, to the very deſires of the
people (and that in Parliament) in the fifth yeare
of King <hi>H.</hi> 4 how ſuch Danger, Inconvenience,
and Bondage, can be by Our two Houſes imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in this Act of Ours, without violating that
rule, ſo often urged by them (though not ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
applyed to them without Vs) That a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable
thing ought not to bee imagined of
the Parliament. And it is as ſtrange to Vs, that
all this ſhould happen by this Commiſsion, and
yet that Our Subjects ſhould, for ſo many yeares
paſt, have enjoyed ſo many happy dayes in the
reigne of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and Our Father,
both of bleſſed memory, under the proviſion of
<hi>Lieutenancy,</hi> which is agreed by this Declaration
<hi>to be little differing</hi> from thoſe of the Commiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Array <hi>in the Powers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And laſtly, Wee demand, Whether the perſons
appointed over the <hi>Militia</hi> by Our Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
have not, by their pretended Ordinance
or Orders, moſt of thoſe powers; nay, ſome grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43196:7"/>
over the Subject, in this matter of the <hi>Militia,</hi>
then are in this Commiſsion? and how they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
can imagine theſe powers to be of a better
nature by their authority, then they are by Ours?</p>
            <p>And as to this taxe of danger and inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
as in the generall it did require no anſwer
at all, (though for the ſatisfaction of Our people,
Wee have therein thus enlarged Our ſelves) ſo
for that particular of the Yoke of Bondage there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
in making it heavier then that of Ship-money,
ſince they have not ſhewed in what particulars,
Wee ſhall ſay no more but this: That by this
Commiſsion <hi>no money</hi> at all comes to Vs, or to
Our diſpoſe; nor is any money appointed to be
<hi>raiſed,</hi> but onely <hi>Arms provided:</hi> And the <hi>Arms</hi>
which Our Subjects are charged to <hi>beare</hi> or <hi>finde,</hi>
are to bee their <hi>owne</hi> proper goods (which Sir
<hi>Richard Hutton,</hi> in his Argument in print againſt
the Ship-money, well obſerved, and thereby dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferenced
the providing of Arms, and payment of
Ship-mony) and are provided <hi>once</hi> for all, and not
<hi>yearly</hi> to be renewed, as taxes for money might
bee, and remaine in their <hi>owne cuſtody,</hi> and for
their owne defence as well as Ours.</p>
            <p>Wee ſhall now proceed unto the next generall
iſſue, touching the pretended illegality of Our
Commiſsion of Array, and ſhall juſtifie the lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43196:8"/>
thereof by <hi>Common Law,</hi> and by the <hi>practiſe</hi> of
former Ages conforme to it; and by <hi>Statutes</hi> in
the very point againſt all the ſeverall pretences
mentioned in the Declaration, whereunto Wee
ſhall give particular Anſwers.</p>
            <p>And Wee ſhall firſt begin with the <hi>Common
Law,</hi> whereunto the Declaration ſaith, this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion
is contrary; and therein affirme,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That this Our Commiſsion is warranted by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fundamentals of Our Government, and (as VVee
ſaid in Our late Proclamation) the right of iſſuing
thereof is inherent in Our Crowne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For ſince (as Wee hope none will deny) the
Kingdome muſt of neceſsity be ever in readineſſe
(in time of danger at leaſt) by power of Arms to
prevent or ſuppreſſe Rebellion at home, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion
from abroad; and to that end the Subject
muſt be armed and prepared before hand, and
conducted after, as there ſhall be occaſion: And
that this cannot be done without a Command or
Government, Wee deſire much to know in
vvhom, out of Parliament, (for Parliaments are
not alwayes, nor can bee called at all times, or
meet on the ſuddaine) this power can be but in
Vs as the Supreame Governour; (as it is in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
States, be the perſons of the Governours one
or more, according to the forme of each State)
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43196:8"/>
And can the Supreame Governour, according to
his duty, and Our Selfe more particularly, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Our Oath, otherwiſe afford Our people
that protection which is due unto them, in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to them the Lawes in the matter of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
and Liberty againſt private injury or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsion,
As well as Our Selfe, and them, and
whatſoever is deare unto any of Vs, againſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
or Rebels, eſpecially the juſt Rights and
Prerogatives of Our Crowne, wherewith God
hath truſted Vs, (according to the fundamentall
and well-eſtabliſhed policy of Our State) as well
for the peoples good as Our owne honour, both
which muſt bee preſerved; And will any man
ſay, that by calling of Our Parliament, (which is
but a meeting of Vs and Our Subjects, (and ſuch
they continue as well collectively in the two
Houſes, as they were before ſingly) and a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in its owne nature diſſolvable at Our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
and though now enlarged by Vs in time,
yet not in power) Wee are growne leſſe, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
with any thing to them either by way of
abdication, or communication of Our Royall
Power? This upon the common principles of
Reaſon and Government is ſo obvious to every
man, that Wee ſhall for the preſent proceed no
further therein, either by quotations of Acts of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43196:9"/>
Parliament, or other legall authorities, (ſome
whereof Wee have recited in Our late Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions)
till Our two Houſes ſhall give Vs ſome
juſtifiable inſtance of ſome good time to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>Wee come next to the continuall practice by
Vs alleadged (being alone ſufficient to declare an
originall fundamentall Law of Our Kingdome,
or at leaſt by a tacite conſent to introduce a Law)
and to this purpoſe Wee ſhall ſhew that the
power of <hi>granting Commiſsions for the defence of
the Kingdome</hi> in the generall, whereunto onely
Wee applyed and doe apply the opinions of Sir

Ages.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:43196:9"/>
And this practice, the Penner of this Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43196:10"/>
doth indeed not deny; for having before
confeſſed the often iſſuing of Commiſsions of
Array, after 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4 in the times of <hi>H. 4. H.</hi> 5. and
<hi>H.</hi> 6. (and hee might have brought it to later
times, if hee had ſo pleaſed) he doth afterwards
confeſſe, that divers Commiſſions of Array iſſued
in divers Kings Reignes before 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4. But as to
this point of practice before 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4. hee ſaith by
way of anſwer, That for the moſt part they were
warranted by particular Acts of Parliament. And
yet amongſt ſo many preſidents of ſeverall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsions,
he gives inſtances onely of two yeares
in 13. &amp; 14. <hi>E.</hi> 3. of Commiſsions of Array then
iſſued, warranted by Act of Parliament.<note place="margin">Rot. Par. 13. E. 3. P. 2. N. 39. Rot. Parl. 14. E. 3. P. 1. N. 53.</note> Which,
if true, doth no more diſprove the legality of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Commiſsions of Array, conſtantly iſſued
without a Parliament, then it doth of Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of Oyer and Terminer (which at the ſame
time in 14. <hi>E.</hi> 3. together with the Commiſsions
of Array, were appointed to iſſue to the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons)
or of any other Act, which the King doth by
the advice of his Parliament, though he may do it
without them: rather it implyeth the legality, and
the former uſage of ſuch Commiſsions of Array,
in that it appoints ſuch Commiſsions to iſſue, but
limits not at all the particular Clauſes or Powers
to be inſerted therein, as a thing known and uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
to be done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:43196:10"/>
But the truth is, both the preſidents do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
the drawing of men out of the Kingdome
to a forraign Warre; and ſo are nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
Wee have in hand. And that of 13. <hi>E.</hi> 3. is not
at all a Commiſsion of Array, but of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
giving power to the Lord <hi>VVake,</hi> and others
to provide moneyes, and to cauſe certaine perſons
there named, who had particularly undertaken
the ſervice of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Warres, <hi>Leur arraier &amp;
appareiller d'aller vers, Newcaſtle:</hi> To array and
prepare themſelves to goe to Newcaſtle: (whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they were to be brought at the charge of the
Counties) and to be there at a time appointed.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſet forth the continuall practice
of iſſuing forth Commiſsions of Array in former
ages (whereunto Wee never found, till now, any
exception, as for <hi>home-defence</hi>) and the abſolute
neceſsity thereof, Wee doubt not but every indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Iudgement will eaſily conceive, That this
power is a right Vs by by the Common Law.
And the rather, when they ſhall conſider, That a
Commiſsion of Array having beene iſſued by the
King in 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4. The Commons in Parliament,
that yeare did not except to any part thereof <hi>as
illegally,</hi> no, not to the Clauſes, which ſeemed hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
over the Commiſſioners; nor did except at all
<hi>to any the powers of execution thereof over the perſons
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43196:11"/>
to be commanded,</hi> but did acknowledge the Royall
aſſent, for the amendment, and alteration of that
Commiſsion into the now preſent forme, to be
an Act of <hi>great grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And herein Wee cannot but admire, that the
Penner of this Declaration ſhould urge it as a
reaſon why the Commons in that Parliament of
5. <hi>H.</hi> 4. complained not for reliefe againſt the
Commiſsion in the powers of execution over the
perſons to be commanded, becauſe (as hee ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth)
they knew that they were ſo clearly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the late Statute of 4. <hi>H.</hi> 4. Whereas (if it had
beene ſo) they ſhould the rather have complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
becauſe they iſſued againſt ſo late a Statute, ſo
cleare in the point, (unleſſe the policy and temper
of the times be ſince much altered) for in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of ſo high a nature as the powers of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion,
which (as this Declaration confeſſeth)
did ſurely moſt concerne them and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
They were bound, as well in duty as
diſcretion, to have ſought remedy againſt ſo
great a violation of the Law and Liberty; and
the rather at this time, when they thought fit to
petition againſt part of the Commiſſion, ſince an
exception but to a part, eſpecially by him, who
ought to complaine againſt the whole, is a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
preſumption of his allowance of the reſidue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:43196:11"/>
Wee come now more particularly, to the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of this Our Commiſsion, as it ſtands by
Statute-Law, and herein (as in the matter princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
inſiſted upon in the Declaration to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved)
Wee do affirme, as formerly in Our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That this Our Commiſſion is warranted by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in</hi> 5. H. 4.</p>
            <p>And to this purpoſe, Wee do obſerve; that this
Declaration doth confeſſe, That the Record in
the Parliament of 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4. concerning the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion
of Array, is an Act of Parliament; And that
the Queſtion is now onely about the meaning
thereof, Whether the Parliament meant thereby,
onely to take away <hi>ſome penall clauſes touching the
Commiſsioners;</hi> (as the Declaration affirmes, to
which purpoſe onely it alloweth it for an Act)
or elſe to ſettle alſo <hi>the powers of execution thereof,
over the perſons to be commanded,</hi> as Wee affirme.</p>
            <p>And therein (as Wee do agree) that at the firſt,
the Complaint of the Commons, was onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of <hi>ſome Clauſes</hi> &amp; <hi>wordes therein, which were
Greivous, and Dangerous to the Commiſsioners:</hi> So
it cannot be denyed, but that afterwards the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
of the Commiſsion ſo complained of, was
<hi>delivered</hi> by the King to the Commons, with an
expreſſe Generall Liberty (without any reſtraint)
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:43196:12"/>
to correct it <hi>according to their owne mindes,</hi> and
thereupon the Commons did make uſe of that
further Liberty, and corrected the Copy, in divers
materiall <hi>Clauſes,</hi> and Words which concerned
<hi>the powers of Execution,</hi> as well as thoſe, which
concerned <hi>the Commiſsioners</hi> (though the contrary
be ſtrangely affirmed by the Penner of this Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration)
as may appeare more particularly by the
clauſes following, wholly omitted by him.</p>
            <p>1. Firſt, the Copie gives power, <hi>Ad armari
faciend. omnes illos qui de corpore ſunt potentes &amp; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biles
ad armand. tam illos qui de ſuo proprio habent
unde ſeipſos armare poterunt, quàm illos qui non habent
unde ſeipſos armare poterunt;</hi> To cauſe to be armed,
all thoſe who have of their own thereby to arme
themſelves, as well as thoſe, who have not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
of their owne to arme themſelves. Which
laſt Clauſe, concerning the Arming of thoſe, who
are able of Body, but not in Eſtate (being ſuch as
are by Vs before reckoned amongſt the third ſort
of Our Subjects) is wholly omitted in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion,
as it now ſtands corrected in 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>2. The Copie, as concerning the aſſeſsing, and
diſtraining of all thoſe who are able in their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates,
but not in their Bodies, goes therein thus;
<hi>Ad inveniend. juxta quantitatem terrarum &amp; bono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
ſuorum, &amp; prout rationabiliter portare poterunt,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:43196:12"/>

armatis, &amp; arous, &amp; ſagittas ſagittariis ſic
arraiatis &amp; triatis, qui non habent armaturas arcus
&amp; ſagittas de ſuo proprio, nec unde armaturas, arcus,
&amp; ſagittas emere &amp; providere poterunt, &amp; ad contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buend.
expenſis omnium illorum qui ſic laborabunt pro
defenſione dicti Regni noſtri, tam infra dictum Com.
noſtrum quàm extra, quandocunque indiguerit; Ita
quòd illi qui morabuntur, &amp;c.</hi> For the finding of
Armes, according to the quantity of their Lands
and goods, and as they may reaſonably beare, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their degree, for men at Armes, and men Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;
and Bowes and Arrowes for Archers ſo
arrayed, and trained, which have not Arms, Bows
and Arrows of their owne, nor have wherewith
they can buy and provide Arms, Bowes, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes;
and to contribute to the expences of all
thoſe which ſhall ſo labour for the defence of
Our ſaid Kingdome, as well within that Our
County as without, whenſoever there ſhall be
need. All which, as may appeare upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring,
is much beyond that Commiſsion of 5.
<hi>H.</hi> 4. as it was entred after the correction.</p>
            <p>Vpon theſe proceedings in 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4. the corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
Copie being preſented to the King, with a
Prayer by the Commons; <hi>That from thenceforth
forward, no Commiſsion of Array ſhould iſſue other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:43196:13"/>
nor in other VVords, then was contained in the
Copie ſo corrected, &amp;c.</hi> An Act was thereupon
made by the Kings Royall aſſent thereunto, by
the advice of the Lords.</p>
            <p>And thus upon the whole Record it is cleare,
That in the litterall Sence the Commiſsion is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enacted in the whole; and We do not obſerve
that to be denyed in the Declaration. And the Art
of the Penner ſeems to be ſpent onely concerning
the intent of the Parliament, in labouring to
prove, That the Commons meant nothing in the
Act, but the taking away the penall clauſes and
words concerning the Commiſsioners. And the
Argument is drawne onely from the end of the
Statute, which the Declaration ſaith was onely
for the ſecurity of the Commiſsioners: And this
the Penner goes about to prove: Firſt, from the
Complaint, as being no more. Secondly, from
their amendment of the Copie, as being onely
concerning the Commiſſioners. Thirdly, from
the Prayer, being to the ſame purpoſe. Fourthly,
out of the occaſion, as ſuppoſing the Act neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
on the part of the Commiſsioners, not on the,
part of the perſons to be commanded. Laſtly,
out of the ſubſequent practice of iſſuing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsions,
that there never went out one agreeable
with the Copie ſo corrected.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:43196:13"/>
And herein, to juſtifie this Our ſence on this
Act of Parliament of 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4. and withall, to
ſhew the errours and miſtakes of the Declaration
in frame of the Argument to the contrary; the
ſtate of the Caſe ſtands thus briefly.</p>
            <p>The Commons complained but againſt the
Penall Clauſes upon the Commiſsioners (which
Wee agree) at firſt; but afterwards, the King left
them at liberty to correct the whole, as they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
And now they alter their minde, and doe
not reſt in correction of thoſe Penall Clauſes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Commiſsioners, according to their firſt
deſire, but (as it is plaine upon the compare of the
Copie, as it was corrected, with the Commiſsion
formerly iſſued, the not obſerving whereof was
the great miſtake, that doutbleſſe now miſ-led
Our two Houſes) the Commons likewiſe (as
wiſe men) who would not wave the advantage
of a proffered favour from the King, did correct
the Commiſsion alſo in the powers of execution
over the perſons to be commanded: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the corrected Copie being preſented, and
the Commons expecting, that even preſently (for
there was then occaſion) and often afterwards
Commiſsions of Array would (as they did in
truth) iſſue forth, did pray not only for the indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the Commiſsioners, which had bin indeed
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:43196:14"/>
but anſwerable to the firſt complaint; But in the
firſt place, they made their Prayer in theſe Words;
<hi>That from thenceforth forward, no Commiſsion of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray
ſhould iſſue otherwiſe, nor in other words then is
contained in the ſaid Copie</hi> (ſo corrected)</p>
            <p>This now being apparently the true ſtate of the
whole caſe (cleared from all miſtakes) we think
it ſo plaine, that it requireth no further Argument
to manifeſt, That the intention of the Parliament,
was both to ſettle the Clauſes concerning the
Powers of execution, and the Clauſes concerning
the Commiſsioners. Thus then Wee paſſe over
to the Anſwer of the Objections.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, for the firſt pretence, That the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
was ſolely on the behalfe of the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners,
Wee agree it to be true, and perhaps the
Commons had no further thought at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
nor till after an occaſion given by the offer of
the Liberty for a totall reformation: But then they
might deſire an alteration accordingly.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond pretence, (which deſtroyed,
makes an end of the queſtion) That the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
made no amendment in the Powers of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
over the perſons to be commanded; It is
apparently miſtaken, as appeares by the particular
inſtances before mentioned.</p>
            <p>For the third pretence of the Prayer, (which
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:43196:14"/>
came not till after the Commiſsion was in all
points ſo as before corrected) That the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
did not deſire any amendment or Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
concerning the Powers of execution, that is
alſo miſtaken; For having made thoſe ſeverall
amendments, in the very firſt place (before any
particular deſired on the behalfe of the Commiſiſioners)
their prayer is as generall, as their amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<hi>That from thenceforth forward, No Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
ſhould iſſue otherwiſe, nor in other words, then is
contained in the ſaid Copie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the fourth pretence, That it was unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to take care of the perſons to be commanded,
becauſe that the Powers of execution over them
were againſt 1. <hi>E. 3. cap. 5. 25. E. 3. cap.</hi> 8. and 4. <hi>H.</hi>
4. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. and that the Commiſsions of that kind
were then ſo lately damned in 4. <hi>H.</hi> 4. Wee An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
That if it were ſo, there was the more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity
for them to complaine, as We have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before. But in this alſo, though it be needleſſe,
We ſhall herein further cleare Our Commiſsion
from thoſe Statutes.</p>
            <p>As for the occaſion of reliefe for the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners
more then for the perſons to be comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
We ſay, the Commons could not but know
that there was no more occaſion for the one, then
for the other: For the ſame Law of 4. <hi>H.</hi> 4. if it
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:43196:15"/>
had (as is pretended by the Declaration,) expreſly
damned the Commiſsion as unlawfull in the
Powers, that (without more) had apparently, to
every common Iudgement, ſufficiently ſecured
the Commiſsioners againſt all refuſalls; And in
truth, the perſons to be commanded, being moſt
of them of the lower ſort, had more reaſon to
feare the Commiſsioners, then the, Commiſsio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
being men of Power, had to feare any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by Fine or Impriſonment, or otherwiſe, from
any of the Courts above, eſpecially in a time
when Parliaments were ſo frequent.</p>
            <p>For the laſt pretence of contrary practice, Our
Anſwer is: Firſt, We deny this (which the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
affirmes) That though many Commiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Array did iſſue out after 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4. yet none of
them did agree with it in words and matter: For
We ſay, That divers Commiſsions were the very
ſame,<note place="margin">See Pat. 7. <hi>H.</hi> 4. part. 2. m. 31. Dorſ. Pat. 11. <hi>H.</hi> 4. part. 2. m. 24. Dorſ.</note>
ſaving in thoſe things which were neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
and as of courſe, to be changed, as (amongſt
others) may be ſeene in the after times of King
<hi>Henry</hi> the fourth.</p>
            <p>And as unto the pretended contrary practice,
Wee agree that it is true, Divers Commiſsions of
Array did iſſue out, which do vary from this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4. yet Wee deny that they muſt be
therefore contrary to it; For (however upon the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:43196:15"/>
Commiſsion of 5 <hi>H.</hi> 4 as it was corrected in the
ſeverall Clauſes in ſuch manner as before) it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
that from thenceforth forward no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion
ſhould iſſue out otherwiſe then is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in that copie; yet it is moſt evident notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
that the meaning of the Law could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be to tye the King to the very words of that
copie; For then at all times the Commiſsions muſt
have begun with <hi>Rex, &amp;c.</hi> and not <hi>Carolus,</hi> or
<hi>Regina,</hi> and ended with the ſame <hi>Teſte</hi> for time
and place, and juſt the ſame <hi>preamble</hi> of danger, be
it true or falſe (whatſoever other occaſion had
been) muſt have been meant to be expreſſed; All
which are abſurd. And in this, as in all Acts of
Parliament, as well as in Wills, the intent clearly
and neceſſarily appearing out of the Act it ſelfe, is
the Law, which in this caſe was not ſo much to
tye to the very identicall words, as, <hi>That the King
ſhould not iſſue out any Commiſsions of Array which
ſhould exceed this which was ſo ſettled by any further
penalty on the Commiſsioners; nor in the powers of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
upon the Perſons to be commanded;</hi> which
ſence appeares in this, that in ſuch a caſe it could
never have been meant, That the Powers of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of the Commiſsion, being ſeverall, as to
Array, Aſſeſſe, Arme, Traine, Muſter, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
and all theſe not neceſſary on all occaſions,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:43196:16"/>
nor all alwayes equally fit to be entruſted to the
ſame perſons, That the King ſhould be bound at
all times unneceſſarily to command the execution
of them all, and equally to entruſt the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
with them all, as he muſt have done in caſe
the Act had beene litterally to be expounded in
each title.</p>
            <p>The truth is, many Commiſsions did vary, yet
ſtill were warranted, as not exceeding that of 5.
<hi>H.</hi> 4. in the powers. As ſometimes granting but
part of them, when there was no cauſe to uſe all;
as alſo, ſome varyed on the occaſion, as ſometimes
providing againſt an invaſion, in this or that part
onely, ſometimes more generall throughout the
Kingdome: And laſtly, it is true that ſome were
upon occaſion of rebellion, for which there is as
much cauſe as againſt a forraign enemy, for thoſe
Commiſsions are not againſt 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4. which was
a preſident, onely for the power of execution of
Commiſsions of Array (whatſoever might be the
neceſſary occaſion to iſſue them) And as this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Commiſsion ſent forth in 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4. and thus
after corrected, was on the occaſion of the feare of
the <hi>French,</hi> and therefore was upon that accident
made onely as againſt an Enemy; ſo if according
to former practice the like had then iſſued in caſe
of Rebellion (in which caſe perhaps Rebellion
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:43196:16"/>
had beene mentioned as the cauſe) then the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsion
of Rebellion might have beene inſerted
in this preſident, and then the Argument might
have beene at this day uſed as well againſt the
warrantableneſſe of this Commiſsion in caſe of
Invaſion.</p>
            <p>And as to the preſident of the Commiſſion of
Array in 6. <hi>H.</hi> 4. cited in the Declaration as not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing
with that of 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4. neither in words or
matter, We conceive it is in ſubſtance warranted
by it: For there the King (upon occaſion of the
<hi>French</hi> being in <hi>Piccardy,</hi> ready to beſiege ſome of
his Forts there, and hearing that they intended to
come to aide the <hi>VVelch,</hi> being then in Rebellion)
ſends out his Commiſsions into <hi>Kent, Somerſet,</hi>
and other Counties, to Array, Train, and Arme the
Inhabitants there, to the end they may be ready,
as well <hi>at the Sea-coaſt, as elſe where; where, and as
often as there ſhall be neceſsity for the expelling, van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhing,
and deſtroying of thoſe enemies when there
ſhall be imminent Danger, as in ſuch caſe had beene
accuſtomed.</hi> But he thinks not fit to give to them
the power of conducting them (which is the
Commiſsion of 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4.)</p>
            <p>But ſhortly after, upon information of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of the <hi>VVelch</hi> to enter into <hi>England,</hi> a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
iſſues to Sir <hi>Thomas Barkley</hi> touching ſome
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:43196:17"/>
of theſe Counties and others, not, to Array and
Arm the inhabitants, for that was done before, but
<hi>ad ſupervidendum,</hi> to ſee that they were ſufficiently
arrayed, according to their eſtates; and to lead them
as often as it ſhould be needfull for reſiſtance of
the Rebels.</p>
            <p>So that as Wee conceive, the powers which
were put together in 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4. are here ſevered; but
there is nothing in either Commiſsion which
exceeds or croſſes the powers ſettled by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion
of 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4. Though if it did, it might prove
the illegalitie of thoſe; but nothing againſt the
legality of Our Commiſsions.</p>
            <p>And if other particular Commiſsions had been
produced, and the differences particularly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
Wee ſhould have beene the better able to
have applyed Our anſwer thereunto; And in the
meane time, Wee looke upon all ſuch Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
as regulated, and warranted by this Act of
5. <hi>H.</hi> 4. and in purſuance thereof.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding, if ſome Commiſsions can
be produced, which are not warranted by 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4.
Yet that will be no ſufficient Argument to prove,
That this of 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4 never meant to ſettle the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers
of Execution, for there is no doubt, but in ſo
long a proceſſe of time, as ſince 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4 there may
have beene ſome deviation contrary unto the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:43196:17"/>
Act, the ſame having not at all times beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
as perhaps alſo may be in the Clauſes
concerning the Commiſsioners, which yet We are
ſure Our two Houſes will not allow as an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
againſt the force of 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4. as allowing it to
be an Act concerning them.</p>
            <p>We might further adde the opinion of Sir <hi>Edward
Cook,</hi> (whoſe great learning and affection to the
Rights and Liberty of the Subject are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known)
who in his Treatiſe of the Juriſdiction of
Courts (being one of thoſe Books ſince this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
deſired, or directed by the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
to be publiſhed) expreſly declares, That this
Act, touching a Commiſsion for arraying and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering
of men, is at this day of force.</p>
            <p>But if any man be yet unſatisfied with ſo cleare
Reaſons on Our part, and in Our anſwers, We ſhall
conclude upon him with the authority of the
whole Parliament of 7. <hi>H. 4. Rot. Parl. n.</hi> 36. within
two yeares after this Our Commiſsion was ſettled,
when probably many of the ſame perſons were
members of both the Parliaments, Whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
that this Act of 5 <hi>H.</hi> 4. is ſo binding as <hi>unto all
the Powers of execution over the perſons to be comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi>
that the Clergy (who in former times had uſed
to be arrayed amongſt themſelves by Writ or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:43196:18"/>
to the Biſhop or Arch-biſhop) were bound,
as within the body of that Commiſsion ſo ſettled
by Parliament. And they thereupon, in that very
Parliament of 7. <hi>H.</hi> 4. are excepted out of this very
Commiſsion of 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4. which is therein mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
and it was then enacted, <hi>That from thenceforth
the Clergy be not any wayes charged amongſt the Laity for
the making of any ſuch Array, nor for any contribution
amongſt the Laity for the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus clearly ſettled this Record of 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4.
as a full Act of Parliaments, well concerning the
powers of execution over the Perſons to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
as the taking away of the penall Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
over the Commiſſioners, There is no further
neceſsity, as to the matter in queſtion, to conſider
whether or no that this Commiſsion in all or any
part thereof be contrary to any of the former Acts of
13. <hi>E. 1. 1. E. 3. cap. 5. 25. E. 3. cap.</hi> 8.&amp; 4. <hi>H. 4. cap.</hi> 13.
ſo much inſiſted upon in the Declaration. For that
in ſuch caſe, the Act of 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4. being the latter had
beene a Repeale of them for ſo much.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſſe, for the further ſatisfaction of Our
people (as being deſirous to omit nothing which
may be done on Our part for the clearing of the
juſtice of our actions) Wee ſhall alſo examine thoſe
Statutes ſo farre as they are made uſe of in this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:43196:18"/>
And therein We profeſſe the difficulty hath been
more to finde out, then to anſwer the inference
made upon theſe Statutes. For the Declaration re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citeth
the Statute of 13. <hi>E.</hi> 1. to bee a particular
Aſsize (or Aſſeſſement) of Arms, both in reſpect of
the <hi>Kinde of Armes</hi> to be found, and the <hi>proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the eſtate</hi> of every man, after which they
are to be found, downwards from 15 pounds
in Lands, and 40 Marks in Goods: And reciteth
the Statute of 1. <hi>E. 3. That no man from thenceforth
ſhall be charged to arme himſelfe otherwiſe then he was
wont in the time of the Kings Progenitors; and that no
man be compelled to goe out of his Shire, but where ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity
requireth, and ſudden comming of ſtrange ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
into the Realme.</hi> (Whereupon it is taken for
granted, That the Statute of 13. <hi>E.</hi> 1. was a proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Armes for defence extraordinary, and that
this Statute of 1. <hi>E.</hi> 3. was meant with reference
thereunto) And alſo reciteth the Statute of the 25
yeare of <hi>E.</hi> 3. (as to be to the ſame effect with the
former) againſt <hi>the constraining men to finde men of
Armes, Hoblers, or Archers, without conſent and grant
made in Parliament.</hi> And laſtly, reciteth the Statute
of 4. <hi>H.</hi> 4. (which confirmes thoſe two Statutes of
1. <hi>E.</hi> 3. and 25. <hi>E.</hi> 3.) And immediately thereupon
makes this concluſion which followes; <hi>That by
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:43196:19"/>
theſe Acts</hi> (not diſtinctly applying the ſeverall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to the ſeverall Statutes) <hi>it clearly appeares, That
the King could not, by the Law, give power to impoſe
Armes upon the Subject,</hi> (which the Declaration cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
ſometimes finding of Armes, ſometimes find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
men at Armes, all of different ſences) <hi>or to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
them to be drawne out of their Counties:</hi> Which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
in ſtating the Caſe, is expreſſed thus, <hi>That
the Subject was not compellable to finde any other Arms
then was declared by thoſe Statutes, or to go out of their
County, but in caſe of Actuall invaſion by Forraigne Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi>
Againſt which this Commiſſion is ſaid to be.</p>
            <p>But for Our clearer paſſage in this buſineſſe, We
ſhall ſingle out the ſeverall Statutes, with the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
(as Wee conceive) intended upon each of
them.</p>
            <p>For the better underſtanding whereof We ſhall
diſtinguiſh of the principall Termes in this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
uſed in the Commiſsion, and ſeverall Acts of
Parliament.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, as for the words of <hi>Arming a mans ſelfe</hi>
uſed in the Commiſsion (as alſo in the Act of 1. <hi>E.</hi>
3.) they are litterally to be taken for the <hi>providing of
Armes for a mans owne perſon,</hi> wherewith hee is to
ſerve as a Souldier, either Horſe-man or Foot-man,
of what kinde ſoever; And the <hi>finding of Armes
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:43196:19"/>
for others</hi> in the Commiſsion, is but the finding the
<hi>bare Armes,</hi> without providing the men, and are
ſo to be taken here, (in whatſoever ſence they may
be taken elſe-where,) as may clearly appeare upon
the very reading. And as for the words (<hi>finding of
men of Armes, &amp;c.</hi>) which are the words uſed in
the Statute of 25. <hi>E.</hi> 3. they are uſually and properly
enough taken for the ſetting forth of Souldiers, the
paying of their wages, or contributing towards ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them</p>
            <p>This then being the ſence of the words, Wee
now proceed to the Statutes, and apply them to the
two Objections; the one againſt impoſing of Arms,
the other againſt carrying out of the County: And
firſt concerning the Statute of 13. <hi>E.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>Thereupon the Objection againſt the power of
impoſing of Armes is this.</p>
            <p>This Statute appoints a particular Aſsize for the
kindes of Armes and Proportions, as before. But
Our Commiſsion doth give power to aſſeſſe for
the kindes (<hi>any Armes</hi>) and for the proportions, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to each mans ability;</hi> (which the Declaration
termes to be <hi>without limitation</hi> and at <hi>pleaſure</hi>) and
ſo is contrary to this Statute.</p>
            <p>To this Wee anſwer; That that Statute of 13.
<hi>E.</hi> 1. (beſides that it is but an affirmative Statute,)
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:43196:20"/>
was made onely for the <hi>ordinary</hi> defence of the
Kingdome, for the <hi>preſervation of the peace</hi> at ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
times; and was not intended as a proviſion
of Armes for <hi>defence extraordinary:</hi> but that for the
publique defence in time of Danger, the King
might, and muſt charge other Armes, and other
proportions, according to the exigency of the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
            <p>Both which appeare together, if Wee conſider
that the proviſion in that Statute mentioned (which
might be of uſe for the Peace) is very inſufficient
for the Service of War: For We cannot but obſerve
the pettineſſe of the Armes, even according to the
uſe of that time; for he that was rated higheſt by
that Act, was to finde but a <hi>Hawberge,</hi> (which in
that place ſignifies a <hi>Gorget) a Breaſt-plate of Iron,
a Sword, a Knife,</hi> and <hi>a Horſe:</hi> and others but <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarms</hi>
(which were Pike-ſtaves) <hi>Knives,</hi> and other
leſſe weapons. And yet at that time there were
<hi>men at Armes,</hi> which were Horſe-men of compleat
Armour, <hi>Hoblers,</hi> which were Light-horſe, and
there were <hi>Pikes, Lances, Pole-axes,</hi> and other wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
commonly uſed for Warre.</p>
            <p>And no leſſe conſiderable is it to this purpoſe,
That for the charge of this defence no man of what
eſtate ſoever, is by this Act charged above the rate
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:43196:20"/>
of 15 <hi>Pounds in Lands,</hi> or 40 <hi>Marks in Goods,</hi> and he
that hath 15 Pounds in Land, or 40 Marks in
Goods, is charged as high as the greateſt: which
is not to be imagined in caſe of proviſion for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
extraordinary.</p>
            <p>And to cleare this further out of this, and other
Acts; it is plain, that this very Act expreſſeth it ſelfe
in theſe words, <hi>That every man have in his houſe Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to keepe the peace:</hi> and appoints thoſe who
are thereby aſſeſſed, to purſue Hues and Cries af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Theeves and Robbers, (which went in thoſe
times with great ſtrength, and in multitudes) <hi>with
their Horſes and Armour.</hi> And the old Articles of
inquiry upon that Statute, being made in the ſame
Kings raigne (and to be ſeen in the Statute-books)
tend onely to inquiry touching the keeping the
peace: as whether all men betwixt the age of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
and ſixty be ſworn to keepe the peace, and
whether they have weapons in their houſes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the quantity of their Lands and Goods, for
<hi>conſervation of the peace,</hi> according to the Statute.
And the Statute of 2. <hi>E. 3. cap.</hi> 6. renewes this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of 13. <hi>E.</hi> 1. in theſe words: Item, <hi>As to the
keeping of the peace in time to come, it is ordained and
enacted, That the Statutes made in time paſt, with the
Statute of</hi> Wincheſter, <hi>ſhall be obſerved and kept in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:43196:21"/>
every point.</hi> And ſtrange it were to imagine, that
the wiſdome of a Parliament, in the matter of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of the Subject, made no greater or better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
againſt an <hi>Enemy,</hi> then againſt a <hi>Theefe,</hi> or a
<hi>Rogue.</hi> And it is not ſo proper to charge the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
at all times in the ſame manner and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as in times of danger.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, for further clearing this Our expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that Statute of 13. <hi>E</hi> 1. Wee ſay, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
(as Wee have already ſhewed) the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsions
of Arrayes did, from the time of making
the Statute of 13. <hi>E.</hi> 1. frequently iſſue both before
and ſince the Statute of 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4. yet none of thoſe
Commiſsions were regulated by the Statute of 13.
<hi>E.</hi> 1. but either they were (as commonly) for ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
them according to mens degrees &amp; abilities,
without mentioning the Statute of 13. <hi>E.</hi> 1. Or,
where any did expreſſe the quality and proportion
of Armes to be found, They varyed from the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of 13. <hi>E.</hi> 1. and appointed other kinde of Arms,
and differenced and proportioned the eſtates of
thoſe who were to finde Armes, otherwiſe then is
mentioned in that Statute: And ſometimes with
an expreſſe Declaration, that the Statute of 13. <hi>E.</hi> 1.
was made for the conſervation of the peace in a
time of peace, when there was no danger of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:43196:21"/>
enemie. And though ſome uſe might be
made of thoſe armes appointed by that Statute in
time of danger, as well as any other weapon: yet
the ſame was not that kind of armour, which was
principally intended as fitting for ſuch defence; as
may appeare by the preſidents above cited. And the
conſtant practice in all after ages for defence extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
hath ever been with other armes, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
other Proportions, as Wee beleeve will not be
denyed by any man.</p>
            <p>Wee come now to the Statute of 1. E. 3. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the objection ſtands thus:</p>
            <p>That the Statute of 13. <hi>E.</hi> 1. having made ſuch
particular aſsize of Arms (as before) for the kinds
and proportions, this Statute doth ordaine, That no
man from thenceforth ſhall be charged to arme
himſelfe otherwiſe then hee was wont in the time
of the Kings Progenitors: Meaning (as the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
takes it for granted) according to that former
Statute of 13. <hi>E.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>To this Wee ſhall give this anſwer: That (as Wee
have proved before) 13. E. 1. was never meant as
of a proviſion for defence extraordinary: and
much leſſe that the Statute of 1. <hi>E.</hi> 3. could intend
any ſuch thing.</p>
            <p>And as the Penner of that Declaration cannot
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:43196:22"/>
therein ſhew any expreſſe reference to that Statute
of 13. E. 1. and can, at the moſt, but barely conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
it; ſo on the other ſide, Wee ſhall out of the
penning and otherwiſe upon ſurer grounds con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the contrary. For firſt, in this caſe, regularly, if
not neceſſarily, (where a later Statute in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
and meaning thereof wholly depends upon
a former, and muſt have reference thereunto) the
Parliament of 1. E. 3. would have made mention
of this Statute of 13. E. 1. (as they did thereof) the
next yeare following, when it was renued, but for
keeping of the peace. Next, in wiſedome it was fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
(if ſo be that they had intended a further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhment
of the particularities of the kinds and
proportions of armes mentioned in 13. E. 1.) that
when they had a former Statute ſo punctuall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
they ſhould not have thus left us for a true un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
of their meaning, to a generall enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of the particular aſsize uſed for armes in former
times.</p>
            <p>But on the contrary, the Statute referring to the
former uſage, in the times of the Kings Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
(which being indefinitely ſpoken, Wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
muſt be underſtood of all Kings times, as
well before as after 13. E. 1.) the uſage therein
meant is but <hi>Conſuetudo Angliae,</hi> the Common Law:
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:43196:22"/>
and the Parliament could not, in all probability, in
the mention of ſo ancient an uſage, intend ſo late
a Statute as this of 13. E. 1. which was but new in
the particularity of the Aſsize, though antient in the
Rule of charging, according to the quantities of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
mans Lands &amp; Goods, the former Aſsizes ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been alſo different: Nor (conſidering that of
Neceſsity, the ſeverall kindes and proportions of
Armes ever did, and muſt vary with the times)
could they intend, that there ever was, for the times
paſt, or could be for time to come, any ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
rule of any ſuch particular aſsize concerning
Armes, whereunto they could refer, as conſtantly
uſed for the times paſt, or that might conſtantly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
for time to come: neither ever was, or can
there be any other conſtant rule, then that generall
rule of the Common Law (which can never faile)
for the aſſeſsing Armes from time to rime, for the
kindes, according to the preſent uſe; and for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions,
according to mens abilities.</p>
            <p>And it were very ſtrange, that the Parliament of
1.E.3. could conceive, That (for the defence extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary)
the particular kindes of Arms in 13. E. 1.
eſpecially ſuch petty proviſions, could be proper
and ſufficient at this time in 1. E. 3. and would ſo
continue afterwards.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:43196:23"/>
And now that We have cleared this firſt part of
the Statute of 1. E. 3. (<hi>as concerning the Arming a
mans ſelfe</hi>) that it is not thereby intended, That the
Subject ſhould not be charged with Armes, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
then according to the Statute of 13. E. 1. We
ſhall deliver what Our ſelves conceive of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
thereof; And it is thus.</p>
            <p>Towards the end of the Reigne of E. 2. ſeverall
Commiſsions of Array, iſſued into ſeverall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
in execution whereof the Commiſsioners had
much grieved and oppreſſed the Subjects: Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that upon complaint, ſpeciall Commiſsions
of Oyer and Terminer (uſuall in thoſe times) were
ſent forth for the enquiry after thoſe grievances
and oppreſsions.<note place="margin">Cl. 19. E. 2. n. 17. Dorſ.</note> And although it doe not appeare
what thoſe were, yet ſince the Complaint was not
againſt the Commiſsions themſelves, as illegall,
Wee cannot conceive otherwiſe, but that it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the wilfull exceſſe of the Commiſsioners, in
their ſurcharging the Subjects with Armes beyond
their abilities of eſtate to beare, (as charging a man
as a Horſe-man, where it had beene ſufficient for
for his eſtate to have borne Armes as a Foot man,
and the like) contrary to the Tenor of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion.</p>
            <p>But this courſe producing indeed little effect, in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:43196:23"/>
the time of King <hi>E.</hi> 2. partly out of the favour,
which it is likely the Commiſsioners did finde, and
partly by reaſon of the ſhort remainder of His
Reign, there was juſt occaſion, both for Complaint
and Reliefe in this next Parliament of 1. <hi>E.</hi> 3. And
though the Particulars of the Petition in 1. <hi>E.</hi> 3. and
the Anſwer out of which (according to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of thoſe times) the Printed Act was made, doe
not appeare, for the want of the Roll of that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
yet Wee may well judge thereof upon this
occaſion, happening within the compaſſe of about
one yeare before, and thereupon conclude, (as for
the true meaning of that Act) That the proviſion
intended to be made, was onely againſt the exceſſe
of the Commiſsioners; which rather juſtifies, then
any way diſproves the Lawfulneſſe of ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion.
And ſo the ſence of the Act, applyable to
the Complaint, will be, That whereas the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsioners
had over-highly taxed the Subjects, the
Act provided, That they ſhould not be otherwiſe
charged, then as they had been in the times of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Kings; and (according to Our Commiſsion)
moderately, and ſo as they might live ſtill according
to their former condition: as in like caſe of other
Statutes againſt outragious Diſtreſſes and Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciaments.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:43196:24"/>
And although Wee take this to be the ſence of
that Statute, yet if any man ſhall thinke this part of
the Statute of 1. <hi>E. 3. Concerning arming a mans ſelfe,</hi>
to be the ſame with the words of the Statute of
25. <hi>E.</hi> 3. againſt <hi>conſtraining any man to finde men of
Armes, &amp;c.</hi> (which is the ſence of this Declaration,
which makes both Statutes to be <hi>to the ſame effect,</hi>
and makes the inference againſt Our power of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
Armes upon them both) We ſhall not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
him therein, being confident to make it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that this Commiſsion is no way contrary to
the words or meaning of that Statute of 25. E. 3.</p>
            <p>But before Wee come to that Statute, Wee ſhall
make one Obſervation upon thoſe Statutes of 13.
E. 1. &amp; 1. E. 3. both together: and thereupon
ſhew, that in the judgement of the whole Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of 4. <hi>H.</hi> 4. (whoſe authority is chiefly inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
upon in this Declaration) Our Commiſsion
is no way oppoſed by either of thoſe Statutes: And
it is this:</p>
            <p>It appeareth, That the late iſſuing of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsioners,
complained of in 4. <hi>H.</hi> 4. (which the
Declaration ſuppoſeth were of the ſame nature
with Our Commiſsion, but Wee deny it) was the
occaſion of the Petition of the Commons in that
Parliament.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:43196:24"/>
In which petition, they intending to ſhew the
illegality of thoſe Commiſſions, and to obtaine
(as they thereupon did) a confirmation of former
Acts to the contrary, do recite the Statute of 25. E. 3.
18. E. 3 <hi>c.</hi> 8. and that part of the Statute of 1. E. 3.
which is againſt carrying of men out of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
and yet nevertheleſſe they wholly omit this
Statute of 13. <hi>E.</hi> 1. and this firſt part of the Statute
of 1. E. 3. concerning the Arming. Whereas it is to be
preſumed, they would have alſo recited this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of 13. E. 1. if they had conceived the ſame to
be (as this Declaration ſets it forth) the certaine Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſize
for armes, and ſuch a Statute whereto all the
reſt had reference, or any way materiall againſt
part of theſe Commiſsions. But howſoever making
uſe of the later part of the Act of 1. E. 3. againſt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
of the Subject out of the County, they would
have made uſe alſo of this part of 1. E. 3. concerning
the arming, and deſired a confirmation thereof, as
well as of the reſidue; and not thus purpoſely reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
it, if ſo be they had not, upon conſideration,
firſt reſolved, that that part of 1. E. 3. was no wayes
againſt the Commiſsion.</p>
            <p>And now Wee come to the Statute of 25. E. 3.
whereupon the Objection ſtands thus:</p>
            <p>By the Statute of 25. E. 3. the Subject is not to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:43196:25"/>
be conſtrained to <hi>finde men at Armes, &amp;c.</hi> if it be not
by common conſent and grant made in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But by this Commiſsion the Commiſsioners
have power, without conſent or grant in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to command thoſe who are able of body
and eſtate <hi>to arme themſelves:</hi> and thoſe who are
impotent, but able in eſtate, to <hi>find Armes</hi> for
others: (which the Declaration in ſome places
calls <hi>finding Armes,</hi> and in ſome places <hi>finding
men at Armes</hi>) and is therefore againſt that Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute.</p>
            <p>For this objection Wee need do no more then
referre Our ſelves to Our former obſervation of the
different ſenſe of the ſeverall words of <hi>Arming a
mans ſelfe,</hi> and <hi>finding Armes</hi> for ſome other,
which are the onely words uſed in the commands
of this Commiſsion, &amp; the words, finding of a <hi>man
of Armes,</hi> or other compleat Souldier, uſed in this
Statute, and intended to be thereby prohibited:
whereby it will be apparent, that arming a mans
ſelfe, or finding bare armes for others, is not within
the letter of this Statute.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſſe for a more particular Anſwer;
1. as to the firſt of theſe powers in Our Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
concerning <hi>Arming a mans ſelfe,</hi> Wee ſay, That
this Act being againſt finding of men at Armes,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:43196:25"/>
or other ſouldiers, doth not any wayes intend to
prohibit the compelling of men to arme themſelves,
(that is, their owne perſons.)</p>
            <p>For that had beene not onely againſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law, whereof that Act is but declarative,
but alſo againſt thoſe Statutes of 13. <hi>E.</hi> 1. (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
it provided, as the Declaration ſuppoſeth,
for defence extraordinary) and againſt 1. E. 3. by
both which Statutes it doth clearly appeare, that
the Subject is in ſome manner compellable to arme
himſelfe: And the Act of 25. <hi>E.</hi> 3. is in generall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all finding of men armed at any time. So
that in that ſenſe whatſoever the occaſion is
(though it be upon an actuall invaſion of an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie)
he cannot be compelled to find armes. And
that expoſition of the Statute would wholly take
away all compulſory means of defence.</p>
            <p>Nor will it be ſufficient to anſwer this, That the
arming according to thoſe Statutes is aſſented unto
in Parliament, and ſo is within the exception of the
Statute of 25. E. 3. For the conſent in Parliament
(intended by this exception) muſt be underſtood
of <hi>future</hi> conſent in Parliament, as well as the
conſtraining men to finde Souldiers prohibited
by the Act is meant of a <hi>future finding</hi> Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.
And in the exception of the Statute
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:43196:26"/>
of 25. <hi>E.</hi> 3. There is not onely to be a conſent, but
alſo <hi>a grant</hi> in Parliament, for ſo the words are (<hi>if
it be not by common conſent and grant in Parliament</hi>)
but in thoſe Acts of 13. <hi>E. 1. &amp; 1. E.</hi> 3. there is no
colour of a grant made at all. And this Statute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
declaratory of the Common Law, as appeares
by the reaſon of the Act delivered in the Petition
of the Commons in theſe words, <hi>Car cet eſt encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
le droit del Realme.</hi> For it is againſt the right of
the Realme, (which is as much as againſt the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall
liberty of the Subject) this Statute of
25. <hi>E.</hi> 3. muſt bee conſtrued as of the Common
Law; and before any Statute</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, as for the other part of Our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion,
which is concerning the charging thoſe
who are impotent in body, but able in eſtate, to
finde Armes for others: If ſuch finding of bare
Armes had beene within the letter of that Statute,
or the finding of a compleat Souldier by ſuch a
man, had beene within Our Commiſsion; yet it
would have beene a harſh conſtruction, (and
doubtleſſe contrary to the intention of the makers)
by generall words, which were meant onely for
proviſion in the generall Caſe, thus to have ſpared
him in this ſpeciall and particular Caſe of impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
from contributing to the defence of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:43196:26"/>
dome, by finding another, as in his place; whileſt
he is as much, or more concerned then others, who
muſt undergoe as much charge, and muſt alſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
their owne perſons.</p>
            <p>And by the Common Law, whereof (as Wee
have ſaid) this Statute is but declarative, thoſe
who were not fit to beare Armes, were notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
chargeable otherwiſe towards home-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
as appeares by the Preſidents already cited,
and many more.</p>
            <p>And now Wee ſhall give the true ſence of this
Statute of 25. <hi>E.</hi> 3. And this will beſt appeare upon
the end and occaſion of the making; which were
theſe.</p>
            <p>King <hi>E.</hi> 3. having had his Treaſure exhauſted
by the <hi>French</hi> Warres,<note place="margin">V. 18. E. 3. Rot. Parl. n. 11. 20. E. 3. Rot. Parl. n. 12. and others of that time.</note> was upon that occaſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
to many hard preſſures upon his Subjects;
So that they had ſeverall times bin charged, with
providing and ſetting forth of Souldiers; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with maintaining or paying of them: and
this in ſo exceſſive a manner, as that it coſt a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſometimes at once a thouſand pound; And all
this was done with relation onely to a forraigne
War, wherein the Title of the King to <hi>France</hi> was
onely in queſtion: and nothing which directly
concerned the Kingdom of <hi>England:</hi> againſt theſe
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:43196:27"/>
there was juſt cauſe, to make proviſion by ſome
Law; eſpecially now when the Wars were renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
And accordingly this Statute was made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
impoſing ſuch charges upon the Subjects.</p>
            <p>And what reſemblance there is betweene thoſe
caſes, and Our caſe, of charging the Subjects onely
to finde Armes for themſelves, or (in caſe of impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency)
for another (as in their ſtead) and all but
for home defence, Wee refer to every mans Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>And thus Wee leave theſe three Statutes of 13.
<hi>E. 1. 1. E.</hi> 3. and 25. <hi>E.</hi> 3. with this obſervation, that
if it be true, (which the Declaration takes for
granted) that they are all to the ſame effect, that
then Our Anſwer to any of theſe three, is an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to the reſt.</p>
            <p>Wee are now come to 4. <hi>H.</hi> 4. being the laſt of
theſe Statutes, which (in the matter of Arming) are
objected againſt Our Commiſsion, as it ſtood at
Common Law, before 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>And herein Wee agree, that the Parliament
Roll, whereupon the Statute is framed, is truly
ſet forth in the Declaration: yet Wee conceive
that, in Subſtance, there is no more upon the
Roll, then in the Print; though ſome paſſages
may give ſome light for the expoſition of theſe
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:43196:27"/>
other Statutes of 1. <hi>E.</hi> 3. and 25. <hi>E.</hi> 3. therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.</p>
            <p>So as this Statute of 4. <hi>H.</hi> 4. being, in truth, but
an Act of bare confirmation, without any additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
explanation, is already anſwered.</p>
            <p>But becauſe the Declaration doth import, That
the Commiſſions (which iſſued lately before 4.
<hi>H.</hi> 4. and were the occaſion of that Statute, and are
damned thereby, as contrary to the Acts of 1. <hi>E</hi> 3.
18. <hi>E.</hi> 3. and 25. <hi>E.</hi> 3.) were of the nature of Our
Commiſſion, (which yet is not indeavoured to be
proved) Wee ſhall alſo give a particular anſwer
touching thoſe Commiſsions.</p>
            <p>And herein We ſay, that firſt it doth not appeare,
nor is there any reaſon to preſume that any of thoſe
Commiſsions were of the Tenor of Ours; And in
caſe thoſe Commiſsions did, amongſt other Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
containe alſo the Powers of Our Commiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
touching the impoſing Armes upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
it doth not appeare that thoſe Commiſsions
were particularly in thoſe very powers held un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.
Both which muſt (but neither will) be
proved, otherwiſe there can be no application.</p>
            <p>But the truth is apparently to be inferred out of
the Roll, That upon thoſe Commiſsions the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
were inforced to go, or to finde others to goe
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:43196:28"/>
at their owne charges, not onely out of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Counties, but alſo (upon occaſion of ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections)
into <hi>VVales,</hi> which at that time, and
(untill the Act of Vnion 27. <hi>H.</hi> 8.) was to ſome
purpoſes, at leaſt commonly reputed a diſtinct Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion;
as appeares even by this Parliament Roll,
in theſe words,<note place="margin">9. H. 4. R. Parl. n. 17. 6. H. 4. R. Parl. n. 9. 1. H. 5. R. Parl. n. 17. 2. H. 4. C. 10. Stat. 2. H. 4. cap. 20.</note> That none of the ſaid Commons
be diſtrained to goe into <hi>VVales, or elſe-where out of
the Realme,</hi> and otherwiſe: (the uſuall phraſe in
ſeverall Acts of Parliament, being alſo to this day,
the Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> and Dominion of
<hi>VVales.</hi>) And ſuch a Commiſsion Wee may well
admit to be againſt all thoſe three Statutes, without
impeachment of Ours.</p>
            <p>Wee ſhall ſay no more as to this Statute ſingle,
but that (as We have obſerved before) both in the
Parliament Roll, and Printed Act, the firſt Clauſe
of 1. <hi>E.</hi> 3. concerning arming, being purpoſely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
it ſhewes that the meere matter of cauſing
the Subject to be armed, was not the grievance
then complained of, or meant to be redreſſed.</p>
            <p>Having thus farre proceeded in Our particular
Anſwers unto the ſeverall Statutes of 13. <hi>E.</hi> 1.
1. E. 3. 25. E. 3. and 4. <hi>H.</hi> 4. as they were appliable
to the firſt Objection made upon them, againſt
Our impoſing of Armes upon the Subject. Wee
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:43196:28"/>
ſhall, in the next place, proceed to the Anſwer of
the other Objection made againſt Our Commiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
upon the Statute of 1. E. 3. and 4. <hi>H.</hi> 4. of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation:
(For as to the other Statutes of 13. E. 1.
and 25. E. 3. We doe not conceive, that they are, or
can be meant unto this purpoſe.) Hereupon the
Objection is this:</p>
            <p>That by the Statute of 1. E. 3 and 4. <hi>H.</hi> 4. the
Subject is not compellable to go out of His Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
but in caſe of the ſudden coming of an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
which the Declaration interprets of an actuall
Invaſion: But this Commiſsion gives Power, not
onely to compell the Subject to goe out of his
County before an actuall Invaſion (as the caſe is
put in the ſtating of it) but (as it is expreſſed in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parts of the Declaration) without Limitation,
and at pleaſure.</p>
            <p>To this Objection Our Anſwer is, That both
the ſence of the Statutes, and of the Powers of
Our Commiſsion are miſtaken. For firſt, (as Wee
have before ſtated it) Our Commiſsion gives that
Power of conducting out of the County, onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
an Enemy, and for defence of the Countrey,
in caſe of imminent danger, and but when and
where it ſhall be moſt needfull; (And ſo not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
limitation, and at pleaſure.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:43196:29"/>
And ſecondly, as to the ſence of the Statutes, We
do deny, that the Subject is not compellable to goe
out of his County, unleſſe in caſe of an actuall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion,
by a forraigne Enemy.</p>
            <p>And herein, though Wee have not upon this
Commiſsion neceſſary occaſion to diſpute it; yet
Wee cannot but obſerve, That the Declaration al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
of no neceſsity of compelling the Subject
out of the proper County, in caſe of actuall rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
and onely againſt a forraigne Enemy; the
ground whereof is a miſtake (in recitall of the
Statute of 1. <hi>E.</hi> 3. by the Act of confirmation of
4. <hi>H.</hi> 4. of the word, <hi>And</hi> betweene the two
words, <hi>neceſsity</hi> and <hi>ſuddaine comming;</hi> The Act of
1. <hi>E.</hi> 3. going thus, That no man be diſtrained to
goe out of his County but where neceſsity requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
<hi>and</hi> ſudden comming of ſtrange enemies into
the Realme. And the Act of 4. <hi>H.</hi> 4. (which as
We have before obſerved, reciteth not the whole
Statute of 1. <hi>E.</hi> 3. but ſo much thereof, as upon
occaſion of the late forraigne ſervice did then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
the preſent complaint) being in theſe
words, That none ſhall be diſtrained to goe out
of their County, but onely for the cauſe of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
(<hi>Of</hi>) ſudden comming of ſtrange enemies into
the Realme.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:43196:29"/>
Whereas, if in this recitall the word (<hi>And</hi>) had
been put in place of the word, <hi>Of,</hi> or before it,
both had agreed, and ſo the ſence of the Statute,
as to this matter of going out of the County, had
been upon 4. <hi>H.</hi> 4. as it is upon 1. <hi>E. 3. That no
man be compelled to go out of the County, but in caſe
of neceſity or coming of enemies:</hi> the word (<hi>And</hi>)
in expoſition of Statutes being moſt frequently
taken for (<hi>Or</hi>) according to the Subject matter,
and ſo the Statute had excepted two caſes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity
ariſing from within (by actuall rebellion)
and neceſsity ariſing from abroad (by ſudden
coming of ſtrange enemies:) this exception in
both being abſolutely neceſſary for defence of
the Realm and according to the Common Law
(of which the Statute is but declarative) and the
practice both before and ſince. And indeed it
could be no otherwiſe in property of ſpeech, for
there cannot be a cauſe of neceſsity <hi>of</hi> the ſudden
coming of enemies, but there is a neceſsity of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
<hi>againſt</hi> their coming.</p>
            <p>And in this caſe We are to be guided by the
Statute 1. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. as it was Originally, as it is alſo
truly ſet forth in the Declaration, and agrees with
all printed Statutes both in Engliſh and French,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:43196:30"/>
&amp; ancient Manuſcripts, all of them derived from
the Originall Statute Roll which was loſt before
4. <hi>H.</hi> 4. (that which now remains being but a
Tranſcript of a Tranſcript.)</p>
            <p>Thus then, without more, We ſhall apply
Our ſelves to the Objection as it is made upon
the words of 1. <hi>E.</hi> 3. both in the Originall and the
Recitall. And We ſay That the Subject is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellable
to go out of his County for defence of
the Kingdom, as neceſsity ſhall require, before
the Landing or other Entry of the Enemy, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
his Landing or Entry.</p>
            <p>And for this We ſhall but recite the words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine;
And they are theſe, <hi>That no man be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to go out of his County, but where neceſsity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
and ſudden coming of ſtrange enemies into
the Realm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherein it ſeemes to Us moſt plaine, that
theſe words require no ſuch Actuall Landing,
or Entry of an Enemy into the Kingdom, before
the Subject is Compellable out of his County.
For the words of the Act are not (as to this
point) when the Enemy <hi>is come,</hi> but <hi>upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
not <hi>within</hi> the Realm, but <hi>into</hi> the Realm. And
all men know, that in ordinary Speech, a man
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:43196:30"/>
may be ſaid to be coming into a place when he is
upon a remove to a place; but moſt properly,
when he is on his way, eſpecially when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth,
with an intention to enter thereinto,
and in ſuch ſence theſe words of coming into the
Realm muſt be taken in this Statute.</p>
            <p>But in caſe the words (<hi>of the enemies coming into
the Realm</hi>) might bear a doubtfull interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that ſence muſt be taken, which agrees with
the Common Law before practiſed, Whereof this
Act is but Declarative, &amp; the conſtant practice of
all ages ſince that is, That the Subjects have ever
been commanded, and gone out of the County
againſt the Enemy before any Landing or Entry.</p>
            <p>And to give this Statute of 1. <hi>E.</hi> 3. any other
ſence were againſt all Common reaſon, and the
rules of government and defence; which is, not
to let the Enemy firſt come in, if it be poſſible to
keepe him out: and it may be much more eaſe
to prevent the coming into the Land, (eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by Sea in oppoſing the Landing) then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to expell him: And it cannot be expected,
that the Forces of one County alone, ſhould be
able to reſiſt the entry of a powerfull Enemy.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, as for thoſe Commiſſions, which
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:43196:31"/>
were damned in 4. <hi>H.</hi> 4. thoſe had no reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
to our Caſe, nor are warrented by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of 1. E. 3. For that (as appeares before)
the Subject was then carried out of the County
not for defence of the Kingdom, as the Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this Statute requires, but for ſuppreſſion of
an Inſurrection in <hi>Wales,</hi> which was not then ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
as part of the Realm: and the Prayer of the
Commons in 4. <hi>H.</hi> 4. made upon that Occaſion,
and therein grounded upon 1. <hi>E.</hi> 3. was not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
becauſe they were carried out of the Counties,
but becauſe they were carried out of the Realm
in a Service, which was not for the neceſſary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
thereof.</p>
            <p>We have thus far, upon this laſt head of Our
diſcourſe, only Anſwered the Objections made
upon theſe Statutes of 13. <hi>E. 1. 1. E. 3. 25. E.</hi> 3. and
4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>H.</hi> 4. We ſhall now conclude this part of Our
Anſwer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with a return of all thoſe Statutes againſt
the Declaration, and in juſtification of Our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion.</p>
            <p>Firſt, as concerning 13. <hi>E.</hi> 1. ſince that (as We
have before obſerved) the Statute was made on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with relation to the keeping of the peace, it
implies, that there is another rule in the matter
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:43196:31"/>
of impoſing of Armes for defence extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as for 1. <hi>E.</hi> 3. (beſides Our former
obſervation, That in all probability, the Act
was made but upon Complaint againſt the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
of Charging by the Commiſsioners, and
not againſt the powers of that Commiſsion,
which had lately before iſſued, which rather
juſtifies the Commiſsion then otherwiſe.) We
further ſay, That if We ſhould admit, that the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of 1. <hi>E. 3. That no man ſhould be charged to
arm himſelfe, otherwiſe then he was wont in the time of
the Kings Progenitors,</hi> hath any relation unto 13.
<hi>E.</hi> 1. and that ſo the ſence thereof were, That
none ſhould be compelled to finde Arms, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
then according to that Statute of 13. <hi>E.</hi> 1. Yet
then that Statute of 1. E. 3. (as 'tis plain) muſt be
meant only as concerning ordinary defence; and
that as the Subject is in cafe of neceſsity to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
out of the County, So in that caſe he may be
compelled to be Armed otherwiſe then at ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
times.</p>
            <p>To this purpoſe We note, that in the Statute
there are two diſtinct propoſitions joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
one againſt the Arming of the Subject, the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:43196:32"/>
other againſt going out of the County; And the
clauſe which is next ſubjoyned is an exception
<hi>Sinon pour cauſe de neceſsite, &amp;c.</hi> Unleſſe it be for
neceſsity, <hi>and the ſudden coming of ſtrange enemies.</hi>
Which exception, upon ſuch admittance, is not
only appliable to that laſt clauſe before, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>the going out of the County,</hi> but as to the <hi>Arming:</hi>
The ſence thereupon alſo being thus; That
though in caſe of ordinary defence, the Subject
be not compellable to bear other Arms then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to 13. <hi>E.</hi> 1. as neither to go out of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
County; yet for the extraordinary defence of
the kingdom, in caſe of neceſſity (wherein more
muſt be done then ordinarily) both, Arms are to
be impoſed by other rules then in 13. <hi>E.</hi> 1. and alſo
the Subjects are to go out of the County; For ſo it
followeth in the next words of the Act; which
are theſe, <hi>And then it ſhall be done, as bath been uſed
in times paſt, for the defence of the Realm.</hi> And this
ſenſe, upon this admittance, cleerly appeareth out
of the courſe of former times in ſuch caſes, to
which the Statute doth refer.</p>
            <p>As for 25. <hi>E.</hi> 3. (beſides that the Declaration
faith it is to the ſame effect with 1. <hi>E.</hi> 3. and was
made with relation to a forraign war, as We
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:43196:32"/>
have obſerved,) if (as the Declaration muſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit)
that the exception of finding men at Arms
&amp;c. by Common conſent, and grant in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
be intended as well of Acts of Parliament
paſt as to come, then Our Commiſſion, in the
power of impoſing Arms, being warranted by 1.
<hi>E.</hi> 3. is alſo warranted by that Act of 25. <hi>E.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>And for 4. <hi>H.</hi> 4. (beſides what We have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
obſerved, upon the omiſsion therein of the
firſt part of 1. <hi>E.</hi> 3. concerning impoſing of Arms,
and that it applies 25. <hi>E.</hi> 3. but to a forraign war)
the generall ſence, and Judgement of that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
excepting then only againſt other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsions,
ſeems to allow of this; for that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
it is not to be imagined, that immediately
in the ſame yeer, there ſhould iſſue out a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion
of Array, and in the next yeer, there
ſhould iſſue out that other which was corrected
in 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4. both of the ſame form, and the latter
bearing <hi>Teſte</hi> the day of the Summons of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4.<note place="margin">4. H. 4. rot. Parl. part. 2. m. 10.</note> And that at that Parliament,
though ſome amendments were made in it, yet
no exception ſhould be taken to the legality of
the powers: whileſt (as the Declaration ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves)
it is probable, That many of the Houſe of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:43196:33"/>
Commons, and it is certain that moſt of the
Houſe of Lords, were members of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of 4. <hi>H.</hi> 4. and knew the meaning thereof.</p>
            <p>And thus we have anſwered to the full ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
(as We hope) of all indifferent Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
the ſeverall Objections made againſt the
legality of Our Commiſsion of Array as it ſtood
before, and at the making of the Act of 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4. and
thereby proved, That Our Commiſsion was
warranted by the Common Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
thereof remain untouched by the Statutes of
1. <hi>E.</hi> 3. 25. E. 3. or 4. <hi>H.</hi> 4. And that it was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
allowed and ſetled (as a rule or pattern,
whereby Commiſsions ſhould iſſue in after
ages) by the Act of Parliament of 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>We have yet ſome other Objections in Our
way, which admitting the legality of Our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion
as it ſtood in 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4. are made againſt it
upon ſome latter Acts.</p>
            <p>The firſt in time is upon the Statute of 4. and 5.
<hi>P. &amp; M.c.</hi> 4. which ſettles an aſsize and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Men, Horſes, and Arms, which every
man was to finde; which the Declaration ſaith
was <hi>without Queſtion, a repeale of this Statute of</hi> 5.
<hi>H.</hi> 4. And accordingly, We ſhall take that firſt
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:43196:33"/>
into conſideration, For though upon the repeal
of that Statute by <hi>I. Jac. c.</hi> 25. the Declaration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
That Our Commiſsion, if once ſetled by
5. <hi>H.</hi> 4. is now again in force, Yet an inference is
made from thence, That the Parliament of 1. <hi>Iac.</hi>
would never have repealed that Statute of 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5.
<hi>P. &amp; M.</hi> if they had thought that any ſuch power
of impoſing Arms, as is in the Commiſsion,
would have been thereupon revived.</p>
            <p>The words of the Statute of 4. <hi>&amp; 5. P. &amp; M.
cap.</hi> 2. are theſe. <hi>Be it enacted, &amp;c. That as much
of all and every Act and Statute concerning onely the
keeping or finding of Horſe, Horſes, or Armour, or any
of them heretofore made and provided, and all and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
forfeiture or penalty concerning onely the ſame,
ſhall be from henceforth utterly void, repealed, and of
none effect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this We ſay, firſt, that 4. <hi>&amp; 5. Phil. &amp; Mar.</hi>
doth not repeal 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4. either by the words or
meaning.</p>
            <p>As to the words, They extend onely to a repeal
of ſuch Acts which do appoint particular Aſsizes
(or Aſſeſſements) of Arms: all which upon that
Statute of 4. <hi>&amp; 5. Ph. &amp; M.</hi> (which appoints a
new Aſsize for kinde of Arms and proportions)
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:43196:34"/>
would be either contrary or altogether uſeleſſe.
And to that purpoſe the Statute ſpeaks of repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of Acts <hi>concerning keeping or finding of Horſe,
Horſes, or Armour,</hi> which, as it muſt be meant of
Acts concerning keeping or finding of <hi>Horſes</hi> in
particular for kind or number; So as concerning
(<hi>armour</hi>) in generall, it muſt, by the conſtant Rules
of conſtruction of Statutes, be meant of Acts of
the like nature as the former, that is, Acts concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the appointment of ſome particular ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
as a Gorget, a Breſt-plate, and the like,
ſuch as were the Statute of 13. E. 1. and 33. <hi>H.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>But this Statute of 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4. is nothing concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the appointment of any particulars, either
for the kind of Arms or proportions: but doth
onely enact a Commiſsion iſſuable, without
commanding that it ſhall iſſue, which is referred
to the Kings pleasure (upon a lawfull occaſion)
Nor doth the Commiſsion it ſelf mention (as is
apparent) any particularity of Arms or propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>And if the Statute of 4. and 5. <hi>Ph.&amp; M.</hi> were
meant of ſuch Statutes, as ſpeake of finding
Arms in generall, it had as well repealed the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
of 1. <hi>E. 3. 25. E.</hi> 3. and 4. <hi>H.</hi> 4. as this Act of 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:43196:34"/>
which no man will ſay was ever intended.</p>
            <p>But in truth, this Commiſsion being in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
doth no wayes contrary this Statute of <hi>Ph.
&amp; M.</hi> but that the particulars of the Aſſeſſement
by that Act, both for the ſeverall Kinds of Arms
and proportions, might have been very well put
in Execution by this Commiſsion.</p>
            <p>For the Commiſsion gives Power to aſſeſſe
every man <hi>juxta ſtatum &amp; facultates,</hi> According
to his degree and Ability. And this Parliament
of 4. and 5. <hi>Ph. &amp; Ma.</hi> appointing Arms ſitting
for defence of the Kingdom in thoſe times, and
proportions fitting (in their Iudgements) for the
ſeverall degrees and abilities of every man; That
Act did not thereby take away the power of the
Commiſſioners wholly, but did only give parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
rules for the kind of Arms and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which the Commiſsioners were to obſerve
in the execution of their power, thereby only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating,
but not deſtroying their powers.</p>
            <p>And if this Statute of 4. <hi>&amp; 5. P. &amp; M.</hi> had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away the firſt Powers of the Commiſsio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
concerning arming, yet had it not taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the other ſeverall and independent Powers
of Arraying, Training, Muſtring, or Conducting
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:43196:35"/>
thoſe men ſo furniſhed according to that Statute,
but that they had remained to have been execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
(at leaſt by a diſtinct Commiſsion which
might have been iſſued at pleaſure for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.)</p>
            <p>And this alſo appears by the Statute of the
ſame Parliament of 4. <hi>&amp; 5. P. &amp; M. cap.</hi> 3. (which
is in force at this day) which being concerning
muſtering, hath occaſion to mention, and doth
expreſſe the old power ſtill remaining to iſſue
Commiſsions of that nature; in theſe words,
<hi>That if any perſon that ſhall be commanded at any
time hereafter generally or eſpecially to muſter afore
any ſuch who ſhall have authority or commandment
for the ſame, by, or from the King or Queens Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
or the heirs or ſucceſſors of the Queens Majeſty,
or by any Lievtenant, &amp;c. do abſent himſelfe, or at
his appearance do not bring his best furniture of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray
and Arms as he ſhall then have for his perſon in
readineſse, ſhall be impriſoned, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But neither by that nor the other Statute of <hi>P.
&amp; M. cap.</hi> 2. is there any new authority given to
the King to grant Commiſsions for Muſters, but
the ſame is admitted to continue as not repealed.
And as to that point of appearing at Muſters, We
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:43196:35"/>
made uſe of that Statute of 4. &amp; 5. P. &amp; M. cap. 3 in
Our Proclamation: And doe wonder how the
Penner of that Declaration could imagine, We
meant any ſuch further uſe therein upon that Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
as the Declaration ſets forth.</p>
            <p>And here by the way We obſerve a mention in
this Statute, of 4. &amp; 5. P. &amp; M. cap. 3. of a power of
muſtering in Lievtenants, to whom other Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
contained in Our Commiſsion were alſo
granted, and might have been alſo mentioned in
this Statute, if there had been occaſion.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, as to this Statute of 4. <hi>&amp; 5. P. &amp;
M.c.</hi> 2. We ſay, That in caſe that Act of 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4. had
been repealed by 4. <hi>&amp; 5. P.</hi> &amp; <hi>M.</hi> yet this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion
had ſtill continued in force notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
any bare repeal; for that (as we have proved)
this commiſsion was (before that Statute) war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
by the Common Law, which did ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in force ſo far as it was not expreſly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the further particulars of that Act.</p>
            <p>And how We come to the Objection princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
intended againſt this Commiſsion upon
the alteration of the Law at this day ſince 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4.
wherein the caſe is this.</p>
            <p>The Statute of 13. <hi>E.</hi> 1 made an aſsize of <hi>Arms</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:43196:36"/>
for the ſeverall kindes and proportions according
to mens ſeverall eſtates. Then 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4. enacts this
Commiſsion with power to aſſeſſe men accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their abilities. Afterwards 13. E. 1. is repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by 21. <hi>Iac.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The argument hereupon in the Declaration is
made thus:</p>
            <p>That the Commiſsion, as to the finding of
Arms <hi>Iuxta ſtatum &amp; facultates,</hi> is ſo grounded
upon that Statute of 13 <hi>E.</hi> 1. (which was then in
force, and did enact the finding of Arms <hi>juxta
ſtatum &amp; facultates,</hi> in manner as is therein ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed)
that that Statute of 13. <hi>E.</hi> 1. being ſince
repealed, that Commiſsion is likewiſe repealed,
and become unwarrantable at this day.</p>
            <p>For anſwer whereunto, in the firſt place, We do
deny that this Commiſsion is any waies groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon 13. <hi>E.</hi> 1. Firſt, for that (as We have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved)
13. <hi>E.</hi> 1. originally was not meant, as a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Arms for defence extraordinary, much
leſſe ſo intended here.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if it were for defence extraordinary,
yet neither this Act of 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4. nor the Commiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thereby ſetled, have any relation thereunto in
words, much leſſe in meaning.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:43196:36"/>
For the words, There is no mention of 13. <hi>E.</hi> 1.
either in the Act or Commiſsion, but the words
of the Commiſsion are generall, for impoſing
Arms <hi>ſecundùm ſtatum &amp; facultates;</hi> According to
every mans degree and ability, without limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
of the kinde of Arms, or particular ſeverall
proportions of eſtates.</p>
            <p>And for the meaning, We cannot conceive it
to be leſſe, then according to the full extent of the
words, For there is leſſe reaſon to imagine that
the Parliament of 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4. did any waies intend
the aſſize of Arms eſtabliſhed by 13. <hi>E.</hi> 1. then
there was to imagine the like upon the Act of 1. <hi>E.</hi>
3. for that between 1. <hi>E.</hi> 3. and 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4. all kinde of
Arms were more altered then betwixt 13. <hi>E.</hi> 1. and
1. <hi>E.</hi> 3. and in this ſpace of time, Guns were come
into uſe in <hi>England,</hi> which were both neceſſary
to be commanded and provided againſt by other
arms.</p>
            <p>And to avoid Repetitions, We further referre
Our ſelf, in theſe two particulars, to what We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
obſerved upon the Statute of 1. <hi>E.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>And as for any reſtraint of thoſe generall words
of Our Commiſsion, by any conſtruction of Law
to the particular aſsize of 13. <hi>E.</hi> 1. We ſay, That
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:43196:37"/>
though a ſubſequent particular Act may reſtrain
the generall words of a Commiſsion (as We
have ſaid before; upon the Statute of 4. <hi>&amp; 5. Ph.
&amp; M.</hi>) becauſe the ſubſequent act, as it may take
away, ſo it may limit any Power given either by
Common Law or Statute, yet a precedent parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Act (upon the ſame reaſon, becauſe it hath
no ſuch power) doth not regularly reſtrain the
generall words of a ſubſequent Statute, which
hath Power to controll the former; and (as in
Our caſe) where the meaning appears to be as
large as the words cannot poſsibly reſtrain them.</p>
            <p>But in this We need not labour, For though
the Declaration in making way for this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
admits the Commiſsion, to have ſome co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
to be legall, as grounded upon 13. <hi>E.</hi> 1. as to
that part of finding Arms <hi>juxta ſtatum &amp; faculta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes:</hi>
Yet it is the main and throughout ground of
the Declaration, <hi>That this Commiſsion, becauſe it is
generall, is againſt the Statute of 13. E. 1. and the other
Statutes, and ſo void;</hi> whereas, if the Commiſsion
had been reſtrained to 13. <hi>E.</hi> 1. then it could not
have been void as contrary thereunto.</p>
            <p>But, admitting that this Commiſsion was,
by conſtruction of Law, neceſſarily to be regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:43196:37"/>
according to 13. <hi>E.</hi> 1. whileſt that Statute
was in force, Our anſwer is, that nevertheleſſe
this Commiſsion did not fall by the repeal of
that Statute.</p>
            <p>Wherein We ſhall admit (which the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſuppoſeth, though by Us it is diſproved)
That this Commiſsion was not warranted at the
Common Law before the Statute of 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4. and
then the Caſe is but this.</p>
            <p>The Statute of 13. <hi>E.</hi> 1. doth appoint a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Aſsize of Arms for kinds and proportions, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this neceſſary rule, the arms for the
<hi>kinde</hi> ſhall be fit for defence; and for the <hi>proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
ſhall be according <hi>to mens abilities</hi> (for ſuch is
the Act.) Afterwards 5. <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. doth eſtabliſh this
Commiſſion, wherein there is no particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
unto this Statute of 13. <hi>E.</hi> 1. but the rule is
generall to charge Arms, for the kinds, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the uſe of the time (for that is neceſſarily
implied) and for the proportions, according to
mens degrees and abilities: which are equall
rules fit ever to continue, though the kinds and
proportions, may and muſt alter.</p>
            <p>In this caſe We doe agree, That if the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion
had expreſſely referred to charge accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:43196:38"/>
to that Statute of 13. <hi>E.</hi> 1. then that Commiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
could have been no longer of force then the
Statute had continued. For then it had been no
more in ſubſtance, then if the powers had been
but particular, to charge certain Arms, and in
certain proportions according to that Statute.
And in this ſence We muſt agree with the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
That a Commiſsion being ſo grounded
upon a Statute, upon the Repeal of the Statute,
both fall together.</p>
            <p>But in this caſe, (thus admitted) where the
Commiſsion is generall, and if 13. <hi>E.</hi> 1. had never
been, muſt have had its full operation, according
to the words, both for the kind of Arms and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions,
and was regulated but by a bare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of Law, both for Arms and Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
by 13. E. 1. which the Parliament might think
fit to be a rule for that time; it ſeems ſtrongly to
follow, that when 13. <hi>E.</hi> 1. (which was the only
impediment why it did not work according to
the extent of the words) is repealed, the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Law upon this Commiſsion, by force
of that ſtatute, muſt likewiſe ceaſe: and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
muſt be conſtrued according to the
words, the rather for avoiding of this miſchief,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:43196:38"/>
that otherwiſe the Kingdom ſhould be without
all neceſſary means to put it into a poſture of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
which that Act did intend principally <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>,
perpetually to provide for.</p>
            <p>But more fully to take off this Objection, We
muſt here remember (what we have proved
before) that the Powers of this Commiſsion in
the latitude of the words thereof for impoſing
Arms, <hi>ſecundùm ſtatum &amp; facultates,</hi> according to
mens degrees and abilities, was warranted at the
Common Law before any Statute, and was to
be executed without the direction of any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Aſsize for kinds and proportions: As at this
day ſeverall like powers for aſſeſsing men both
by Statute and Common Law according to their
abilities, as for high ways, poor of the Pariſh, and
the like are to be executed.</p>
            <p>Theſe then being the Powers at Common
Law, As it is cleer they are not taken away by
any affirmative Statute, (ſuch as 13. <hi>E.</hi> 1. ſeems to
be:) So if We ſhall admit (as ſtrongeſt againſt Our
ſelf) that there were any negative words in this
Statute or any other Statute grounded thereupon,
that the Subject ſhould not be compellable to be
armed otherwiſe, (which other Statutes (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:43196:39"/>
to the ground rightly taken in the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration)
muſt neceſſarily fall by the repeal of 13.
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 1. Then that Statute being repealed, the
Commiſsion thus freed of thoſe Statutes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
in full force as it was at the Common
Law.</p>
            <p>And now that wee have paſſed over the Acts
of Our Predeceſſors as well before as after the
Act of 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4. We are encountred with Our own
Acts, the Petition of Right, and a Recitall in an
Act this preſent Parliament, as being both againſt
Our Commiſsion.</p>
            <p>Whereunto We need to ſay but this. That it
appears out of themſelves, that neither of them
were ever meant to introduce a new Law: So as
if (as We have proved) Our Commiſsion be
not againſt the Law, as it ſtood formerly, they
were not Intended nor juſtly ought to be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
againſt it. But to give yet more particular
and full anſwers thereunto; We ſay, Firſt, for
the Petition of Right, it no waies extends to our
Commiſsions of Array.</p>
            <p>The Objection made upon it ſtands thus. The
Petition of Right ſets forth, That by the Lawes
and Statutes of this Realm, the Subjects have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:43196:39"/>
this Freedom, That they ſhould not be
compelled to contribute to any Tax, Tallage, Aid,
or other like charge, not ſet by common conſent
in Parliament. And after complains, That di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
charges have been laid and levied upon the
People by Lords Lievtenants, Deputy Lievte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
Commiſsioners for Muſters, Juſtices of
Peace, and others, by command or direction from
Us, or Our Privy Councell, againſt the Laws and
free Cuſtoms of the Realm, which the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
alleadgeth to be the breach of thoſe Laws.</p>
            <p>Then the words of the Petition are thus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
That here is a Taxe or Charge impoſed
upon the people, by Compelling them to find
Arms by command and direction from Us, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Our great Seal, without conſent in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>And the meaning of the Petition is thus infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
That it is very well known, and doth ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
appear, that the charges there mentioned
to be laid by Lords Lievtenants, and Deputy
Lievtenants, were the charging of the Subjects
with Arms againſt Law, by colour of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion
from Us, and conſequently this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion
is againſt the Petition of Right.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:43196:40"/>
For Our cleerer anſwer, We ſhall ſet down the
ſumme of the Petition, for ſo much as concerns
the unlawfull charging of the Subject. And it is
this.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the Petition recites ſeverall Statutes, as
made againſt the compelling the Subject to the
making or yeelding any Gift, Loan, Benevolence,
Taxes, Aids, or ſuch like Charges without Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
conſent in Parliament; and next ſetteth
forth a violation of thoſe Statutes, by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsions
of Loans, and Execution of them; and
that divers other Charges had been laid and levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Lords Lievtenants, and others (as is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid)
and laſtly the Prayer is ſubſtantively of it
ſelf, without any relative words, yet extends to
all that was before complained of, and contains
the ſubſtance of all thoſe former Statutes in theſe
words, <hi>That no man be compelled, to make or yeeld
any Gift, Loan, Benevolence, Tax, or ſuch like
Charge without common conſent by Act of Parliament.</hi>
And Our anſwer to that part of the Prayer, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the reſt, is, <hi>Let right be done as it deſired.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Our anſwer to the Objection ſtands thus.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that whatſoever ſence any words of the
Preamble may ſeem to import, yet without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:43196:40"/>
there is no more in this Preamble then is
after contained in the Prayer: So if Our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion
be not againſt the Prayer, there can be
no Argument againſt it drawn out of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble,
or if in truth there were more in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble
then in the Prayer, (whereunto only the
Royall aſſent extends,) yet nothing could bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
be concluded thereupon (as We ſhall fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhew upon occaſion.)</p>
            <p>This then onely reſts to be conſidered upon
this Objection; Whether the powers, in Our
Commiſsion, to compell the Subjects, able of
body and eſtate to Arm themſelves, and in caſe of
impotency to find Arms for others, for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
defence of the Kingdom, can be ſaid to be
a compelling of the ſubject, <hi>to make or yeeld any
Gift, Loan, Benevolence, Tax, or other like Charge,
contrary to the Prayer of the Petition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the Caſe thus truly ſtated, it is cleere,
That here is <hi>no yeelding or making of Gift, Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
or Loan;</hi> And as for <hi>making or yeelding any
Tax or other like charge,</hi> though it be true, That
this arming a mans ſelf, or finding Arms for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
cannot be done without Charge: Yet We
appeal to every mans underſtanding, whether
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:43196:41"/>
Our Subjects can, upon this Commiſsion, be
ſaid <hi>to make or yeeld</hi> (for ſo are the words) <hi>any
Tax or other Charge</hi> againſt the Petition, any more,
then if We command a City to repair their Walls,
or a Levell (putting the Caſe before any ſtatute,
to take away all colour of evaſion) to repair the
Sea-banks, when they were in decay, being no
particular advantage to Us, but for the Common
good of themſelves.</p>
            <p>The truth is, That albeit the impoſing of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
charges, &amp; commanding divers Acts draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
charges upon the Subject, though poſsibly
for their advantage, are void in Law: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
it doth not follow that they are void as
againſt this Petition. For the Petition of Right,
as againſt the charges therein mentioned, is onely
to be intended of Money, or other thing valuable,
and to be parted with to or for Us, or Our advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage:
ſuch as are all the charges more ſpecially
mentioned in the preamble and Prayer, as that of
Gift, Loan, and Benevolences, And ſuch as were
thoſe Charges intended in the Preamble under
the generall expresſion of divers other Charges
impoſed by Lord Lievtenants, &amp;c. which We
think is very well known to moſt Counties, to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:43196:41"/>
have been meer Pecuniary Payments, and which
We ought to have born. And for the other char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
that is, of Taxes, Tallages, Aydes likewiſe
mentioned, which as to this purpoſe are but <hi>Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noma,</hi>
and of one ſignification, they are meant of
money or other things valuable, and for the King;
and ſo uſed in the old Statutes, and had been in
former times impoſed upon the people, without
Act of Parliament; and accordingly all of them
are ſo to be expounded in the Preamble. And the
Prayer of the Petition ſaith nothing expreſſely
againſt the Commanding the Subject to do a
thing which may be neceſſarily of expence or
Charge, (wherein the Act is onely intended, and
the Charge but a neceſſary Incident) but the
Prayer is onely againſt the compelling of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<hi>to yeeld, or make</hi> thoſe kinds of charges: So
as the cleer ſence of the Petition, both according
to the occaſion of complaint therein mentioned,
and the Laws whereupon it is framed, as well as
the propriety of the words, is only againſt draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the Subject, either money or money<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,
by any of thoſe particular charges therein
mentioned, or any other charge of like nature
(under what ſpecious title ſoever) for the Kings
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:43196:42"/>
advantage, which the more plainly appears, for
that the charge muſt be <hi>yeelded</hi> or <hi>made,</hi> as upon
<hi>Gift, Loan, &amp;c.</hi> which muſt neceſſarily be inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
unto ſome <hi>perſon,</hi> and no other perſon can be
here colourably intended but the <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if the Petition, by any conſtruction, may
extend againſt the commanding of any <hi>Acts,</hi>
which in the execution may induce charges, yet
ſuch charges muſt (according to the very words
of the Petition) be <hi>ſuch like Charges,</hi> that is for Us
or Our advantage, as the particular <hi>Charges there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
mentioned, of Gift, Loan, &amp;c.</hi> But this charging
of the Subject with Arms for the neceſſary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the Kingdom cannot be ſaid for Our
particular advantage, all Our Subjects having
therein a common intereſt.</p>
            <p>As for the meaning of the Petition inforced in
the Objection from the Charges by Lord Liev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants,
and others complained againſt in the
Preamble, ſure We are that thoſe muſt be ſuch in
the particular, as are after contained in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
words of the Prayer, to which We have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
before; And though it be to this purpoſe
ſaid in the Declaration, That thoſe <hi>Charges by
Lord Lievtenants and others,</hi> were meant of <hi>char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:43196:42"/>
of the Subject with Arms,</hi> certainly no ſuch thing
can appear in the Petition, which ſpeaks
but only of <hi>divers charges,</hi> but names none in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular;
nor can there be any other aſſurance that
the Houſes did intend any ſuch thing, but by
Votes, wherein they onely ſpeak: and if any ſuch
Votes had been, We doubt not but We ſhould
have found them inſerted in this Declaration:
And a particular complaint of ſo great a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
(as Our Commiſſion is made to be) would
have been expreſſed in the Preamble of the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
with the Quotations of Statutes to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
as was done concerning other grievances.
But in truth it is well known, That about that
time, upon occaſion of Our wars, there were
divers other charges impoſed by Our Lievte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
and others, of a far differing nature, moſt
of which were by direction from Us or Our
Privie Councell, according to the exigency of the
time and ſome former practice.</p>
            <p>And We do beleeve, that there was at that
time neither complaint or occaſion of complaint
againſt the impoſing of Arms for home defence
of the Kingdom. Howſoever We are ſure that
no ſuch complaint was particularly repreſented
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:43196:43"/>
unto Us, or Our Anſwer intended thereunto.</p>
            <p>And now to cleer this ſence of the Petition
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of the judgement of both Our Houſes this
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Parliament, We demand this Queſtion: If
ſo be the impoſing Arms for defence be a charge
upon the Subject within the meaning of this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition,
how the two Houſes will juſtifie their
Ordinance, which We are ſure they will not call
an Act of Parliament; for without an Act of
Parliament, no charge thereby provided againſt,
can be impoſed upon the Subject, the words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
plain, That no man ſhall be compelled to
make or yeeld any Gift, Loan, Benevolence, Tax,
or other ſuch like charge, <hi>without common conſent
by Act of Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, ſince this Declaration hath given
Us ſuch occaſion to examine Our Commiſſion
upon the Petition of Right, We ſhall conclude,
out of that Petition, That that Parliament did
conceive the powers of this Commiſsion war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
in every point.</p>
            <p>For it is plainly to be obſerved, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
did then take into conſideration the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
grievances of the Kingdom, more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
concerning Military affaires, and therein
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:43196:43"/>
the actions of Lord Lievtenants, and Deputy-Lievtenants
with their Commiſſions and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and their exceeding of their power, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely
the billeting of Souldiers, and the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Billet-money, Muſter-maſters fees, and
others of that nature, were then in diſpute. And
although the two Houſes could not but take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the impoſing of Arms upon the Subject by
Our Commiſsion, of Lievtenancy, &amp; their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to Levy, call together, Arm, Array, Train, and
Muſter Our Subjects inhabiting in Our ſeverall
Counties, and to conduct and lead them againſt
all Our Enemies, and all Rebels and Traytors,
from time to time, as need ſhould require, (in
which particulars they contained the powers of
Our Commiſsion of Array:) Yet the Complaint
was not made againſt them, for what they did by
vertue of their Commiſſion (no more then
againſt the Juſtices of Peace, though complained
of, together with the Lievtenants) but for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
wherein they did exceed their Commiſſion,
upon the Command, or direction from Us, or
Our Councell; the Petition throughout diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
betwixt ſuch Commands, or directions,
and Our Commiſsions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:43196:44"/>
So that We conclude, here was not only an
admiſſion, but an approbation of thoſe powers,
by that Parliament.</p>
            <p>We come now to the recitall in the Preamble
of the late Statute made this Parliament. The
words are theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For as much as great Commotions, and Rebellions
have been lately raiſed and ſtirred up in His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
Kingdom of Ireland, by the wicked plots and
conſpiracies, of divers of His Majeſties Subjects there
(being traiterouſly affected) to the great endangering,
not only of the ſaid Kingdom, but alſo of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of England, unleſse a ſpeedy courſe be taken for
the proventing hereof And for the raiſing and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of men for thoſe Services. And whereas, by the
Laws of this Realm, none of His Majesties Subjects
ought to be impreſſed, or compelled to go out of His
County, to ſerve as a Souldier in the Wars, except in
caſe of neceſsity of the ſudden coming in of ſtrange E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
into the Kingdom, or except they be otherwiſe
bound by the Tenure of their Lands or poſſeſsions &amp;c.</hi>
(upon which Preamble, there is, in that Statute,
ſome proviſion made for a time for raiſing and
impreſsing men for thoſe Services.)</p>
            <p>And upon this Preamble, the concluſion is
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:43196:44"/>
made in theſe words, <hi>That this, Commiſsion is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
contrary to this Declaration is ſo evident, that
it requireth no application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this Objection, We ſay, We might make
Our Anſwer as ſhort as the inference is, by affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
That it is evident, that this Commiſsion is
not contrary to this recitall; And ſurely We think
that what We have already opened, being apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to this Objection, would warrant that
Anſwer.</p>
            <p>But that We may leave nothing undone, that
may tend towards the full ſatisfaction of Our
good people, We ſhall alſo give this a particular
anſwer.</p>
            <p>Firſt, We ſay, That if this recitall had been an
Act, yet there were nothing in Our Commiſſion
contrary to the letter of it, for that by this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſion,
no man is compellable by any ſpeciall
words to go out of his County.</p>
            <p>And the generall words, (giving power to the
Commiſsioners, for leading them to the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coaſt
or elſewhere (as We have often repeated)
are with theſe limitations: They are to lead
them, but when there is imminent Danger of
enemies, for defence of the Kingdom; and then
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:43196:45"/>
only they are to be led to ſuch places, as ſhall be
neceſſary for the expulſion, vanquiſhing, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of the ſaid enemies, And this is a caſe of
neceſsity both within the words of this recitall,
and according to the ſenſe of the ſame words, in
the Statute of 1. E. 3. and 4. H. 4. (therein meant)
as We have before ſhewed.</p>
            <p>And thus we might leave this Objection, but
that it implies a matter of a greater conſequence
then plainly appears. That recitalls of the Law,
in Preambles of Statutes are binding; For in this
Objection, this recitall is called <hi>a Declaration of
the Law</hi> and Our Commiſsion ſard to be <hi>contrary
to that Statute,</hi> and it further implies, That even
in the greateſt and moſt horrid Rebellion, the
Subject cannot be compelled out of the County,
for the ſuppreſsion thereof. But to this We an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwor,
That the difference is apparent, between
an Act of Parliament declarative, and a recitall in
a Preamble: For ſuch an <hi>Act</hi> (in any matter
though miſtaken) being aſſented unto by Us,
and Our two Houſes, is equally binding (as
having equall authority) with an Act introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
of a new Law, But the recitall in a Pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
is no part of the Act (the Royall aſſent being
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:43196:45"/>
only to that, which is expreſſely or tacitely pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be enacted:) Nor can it any wayes ſo much
as imply Our opinion: For otherwiſe, Kings
muſt be inforced oftentimes to deny a good
Law, for an ill Preamble; The conſequence
whereof is great in ſuch an Act as requires expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
where a Bill once denyed, is not regularly
to be offered again in that Seſsion of Parliament.</p>
            <p>And if it were needfull, divers miſtakes, of the
Law in Preambles might be produced by which
We would be loath to bind our Subjects.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſſe, though Preambles be not in
themſelves ſufficient to declare Laws, yet We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
not they are of good uſe, though not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
Arguments to expound them.</p>
            <p>And for Our power in the matter of Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
beſides what hath been ſaid, We might alſo
adde (if it were materiall to this Commiſsion,)
Preambles, Recitals, and other neceſſary Inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
out of other Statutes (made ſince thoſe inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in this Recitall) which would prove, that in
caſe of Rebellion all Our Subjects ought to aſſiſt
Us, and to attend Our Perſon,<note place="margin">See 11. <hi>H.</hi> 7 in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble, That the Subjects, by the duty of their Allegiance, are bound to ſerve their Prince in his Wars, for the defence of Him and the Land, againſt every Rebellion, Power, and Might, reared againſt Him. And 11. <hi>H.</hi> 7. c. 18. Whereas every Subject, by the duty of his Allegiance, is bound to aſſiſt the King at all ſeaſons when need ſhall require; and moſt eſpecially ſuch as have by him promotion or advancement, as Grants, and Gifts of Offices, Fees, and Annuities, which are, and verily be bound by reaſon to give their attendance upon his Royall Perſon, to defend the ſame, when He ſhall fortune to goe in his Perſon in wars for defence of the Realm, or againſt his Rebels and enemies. And 5. <hi>El.</hi> cap. 5. Be it enacted infavour of Fiſhermen, and Mariners, That none of them ſhall hereafter at any time be compelled againſt his or their will, to ſerve as a Souldier upon the Land or Sea, otherwiſe then as a Mariner, except it ſhall be to ſerve under any Captain of ſome Ship or Veſſell for landing, to doe ſome eſpeciall exploit, which Mariners have uſed to do, or under any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon, having authority to withſtand any Invaſion of Enemies, or to ſubdue any Rebellion within the Realm. And ſee 19. <hi>H.</hi> 7. cap. 1, 2, &amp; 3. <hi>E.</hi> 6. c. 2. And 4 &amp; 5 <hi>Ph. &amp; Mar.</hi> c. 3.</note> upon Our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
for the defence thereof, whenſoever We
ſhould require it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:43196:46"/>
And the truth is, the occaſion of this Act, now
urged againſt Us, appears to be for the ſervice of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and the intention of it (for ſo much as is
the enacting part) was to take away all queſtion
concerning the preſsing of the Subjects of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
for the ſuppreſsion of the Rebellion in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
And ſo concerned forraign ſervice, and
not home defence, either againſt Invaſion of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
or Rebels.</p>
            <p>And thus far the work of the Declaration
hath been to overthrow Our Commiſsion by
Statutes alleadged to be directly againſt it. There
remains yet ſome other Objections drawn from
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:43196:46"/>
the opinion of former Parliaments, and the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of Our ſelves and Our Predeceſſors, and
thoſe not directly, but by inferences. But theſe,
as we ſhall ſhew, are ſo farre from concluding
againſt Our Commiſsion, that they rather prove
the contrary.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe Objections is upon the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
of 1. <hi>Jac. c.</hi> 25. and 21. <hi>Iac. c.</hi> 28. of Repeals:
And is thus, That the Statute of 4 <hi>&amp; 5. Ph. &amp; M.
cap.</hi> 2. having repealed this Commiſsion (for ſo
the Declaration ſuppoſeth) They had ſhewed
little care of their own and the Subjects liberty,
in the Parliament of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Iac.</hi> to repeal that Statute
thereby to revive the power of this Commiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which would have ſubjected the people to
far greater bondage: and from thence inferreth,
That it is not probable that the Parliament of 1.
<hi>Jac.</hi> would have repealed,. 4 <hi>&amp; 5 Ph. &amp; M.</hi> As
lik<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wiſe from the Statute of 21. <hi>Iac.</hi> (which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed
the Statutes of 13. <hi>E.</hi> 1. and 33. <hi>H.</hi> 8.) That it
is not probable, that the Parliament of 21. <hi>Jac.</hi>
would have repealed thoſe Statutes (which in a
moderate manner proportioned the Arms every
man was to find in certainty:) And ſuffer an Act
(meaning this of 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4.) to continue, which eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:43196:47"/>
a power in the King without limitation,
not only to impoſe Arms, but to command the
perſons of the Subjects at pleaſure.</p>
            <p>To this We ſay, that both the grounds of this
Objection are miſtaken. For (as We have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
ſhewed) neither is this Commiſsion repealed
by the Act of 4 <hi>&amp; 5 P. &amp; M.</hi> Nor is there any
ſuch unlimited Power given, or Bondage by it,
as is pretended. And therefore Our Anſwer is,
That it is no wonder that thoſe Parliaments
might repeal 4 <hi>&amp; 5 P. &amp; M.</hi> as too hard; and 13.
<hi>E. 1. &amp; 33 H.</hi> 8. as of no uſe: and put the <hi>Militia</hi> of
this Kingdom again wholly under the powers of
this Commiſsion, (being ſo indifferent between
both the other:) And indeed the <hi>Militia</hi> did after
continue under Lievtenants, who had in effect
the powers given by this Commiſsion.</p>
            <p>And now We ſhall return this Objection
thus:</p>
            <p>That thoſe Parliaments of 1. <hi>Jac.</hi> and 21. <hi>Iac.</hi>
would have ſhewed little care of the ſafety and
defence of the Kingdom to have repealed thoſe
Statutes which made proviſion for Arms, if they
had thought there were no Law or Power left in
the King to charge men with Arms for defence
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:43196:47"/>
of the Kingdom, (as the Declaration affirmes
the Law now to be.)</p>
            <p>But whoſoever conſiders that at that time,
and long before, the power of impoſing arms,
was put in execution by Lievtenants, and Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-Lievtenants,
by authority of their Commiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
(which to this purpoſe are the ſame with
Our Commiſsions of Array) and that this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
was not complained of in thoſe Parliaments,
muſt conclude it more then probable, that thoſe
Parliaments did then conceive there was a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
power remaining in the King to impoſe
Arms.</p>
            <p>The next Objection, is from the opinion of
the Parliament of 4. and 5. <hi>Philip &amp; Mary, c.</hi> 3
That if Our Commiſſion had been authorized by
Act of Parliament, that Statute of <hi>Ph. &amp; Mar.</hi> had
been to little purpoſe, whereby the penalty of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment
for ten dayes, or forty ſhillings is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
upon ſuch, as do not appear at Muſters,
being Summoned thereunto by the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsioners
authorized for that purpoſe: Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
as that the Act of <hi>Phil &amp; Mar.</hi> would never
have been made, if they had then conceived, that
We had power to grant ſuch Commiſsions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:43196:48"/>
To this We anſwer, That the particular Arms
and proportions of Arms, were then before ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by the Statute of 4. and 5. <hi>Ph. &amp; Mar. Cap.</hi>
2. under certain penalties upon thoſe who ſhould
be defective, and ſo a great part of the care of the
Commiſsioners of Array was ſupplyed by the
proviſion of that Statute; and the Commiſsions
of Array being not ſo proper, but in time of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and of a larger extent, then the power of
muſtering, a Commiſsion of Muſter (which is
part of the power of a Commiſsion of Array)
would then ſerve the ordinary turn: and for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ordinary default, but at a Muſter, in a time of
no Danger, the puniſhment by 4. and 5. <hi>Ph. &amp;
Mar. cap.</hi> 3. was great enough.</p>
            <p>And for return of this Objection, We ſay, (as
We obſerved before) That this Statute gives no
new power, to grant Commiſsions for Muſters,
but admits the power to grant ſuch Commiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to have been in the King before that time.
And whereas the Statute of 13. <hi>E.</hi> 1. appoints no
other Officers but the Conſtables for view of
arms, it appears by theſe Statutes of <hi>Phil.</hi> and <hi>Mar.</hi>
that the King might appoint His Commiſsio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:
which he could not, if this power of Arms
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:43196:48"/>
had been wholly grounded upon that Statute.</p>
            <p>The Laſt Objection of this nature, is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon the Common opinion or practice;
And is this.</p>
            <p>That the Commiſsions of Lievtenancy, ſo
grievous to the people, and declared illegall in
Parliament, had not been ſo often iſſued, and ſo
much preſſed upon them, if the Commiſsion of
Array, not much differing from it in power, and
not at all leſſe grievous to the Subject, might, by
the warrant and authority of the Laws of this
Realm, have ſupplied their room.</p>
            <p>To this Our Anſwer is, That it ſtands upon
two grounds: Firſt, That the Commiſsions of
Lievtenancy were grievous. Secondly, That they
were illegall: both which ſo far forth at leaſt as
to the powers wherein they did not exceed the
power of this Commiſsion (for the other pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
are not now in queſtion) are cleerly miſtaken.</p>
            <p>For, as for the grievouſneſſe, we ſay theſe
Commiſsions were ſuch as had been long uſed
in the happieſt times of Our Predeceſſors, and
continued to Our Time: And ſuch grievances,
as did, or might ariſe in the execution of theſe
Commiſsions, not warranted by them, are no
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:43196:49"/>
cauſe to quarrell at the Commiſsions themſelves,
more then at the Commiſsions of Peace, becauſe
ſome Juſtices of Peace have exceeded or abuſed
their authority. And howſoever, Thoſe powers
wherein they exceeded not Our Commiſsion of
Array could not be grievous, as we have already
ſhewed.</p>
            <p>And as for the illegality of thoſe powers, We
ſhall not, nor will Our people be ſatisfied by bare
Votes, that they are illegall, The ſame being done
without hearing of Our Councell, and without
adviſing with the Iudges and demanding their
opinions, (a courſe which was formerly uſed in
Parliaments, as appears even by this Record of
5. H. 4. amongſt many others, but in matters of
Law which have of late riſen in Our Houſes of
Parliament, hath (for what cauſe We know not)
been laid aſide.) But We again ſay, theſe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in Our Commiſsions of Lievtenancies are le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall,
and if there be any clauſes in ſuch Comiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
which are illegall, thoſe clauſes could not at all
make the Commiſsions void for ſo much as was
legall, much leſſe take away Our power of gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
new Commiſsions, omitting ſuch clauſes.</p>
            <p>But if We ſhould, for this time, admit the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:43196:49"/>
grounds of this Objection, That Our Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of Lievtenancy had been ſuch as this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
would have them, yet it is but a very
inconſequent Argument, That thoſe Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
would not have iſſued, ſo often, and been
ſo much preſſed, if the Commiſsions of Array
had been Legall.</p>
            <p>For the Commiſsions of Lievtenancy contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
not only moſt of the powers of the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Array, but in many things exceeded them,
and were iſſuable in times of Peace, whereas
Commiſsions of Array commonly iſſued in
times of Danger only; and ſo there was occaſion
for the one Commiſsion, when there was none
for the other.</p>
            <p>But on the contrary, (that we may retort this
Objection alſo,) ſince that the Commiſsions of
Lievtenancy, not much differing from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsions
of Array in Power, (as the Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſaith) and in many things exceeding them,
have ſo often iſſued in the reignes of ſeverall of
Our Predeceſſors, &amp; were allowed by the Judges
of thoſe times, obeyed without diſpute, and not
queſtioned in the Parliament of 1. <hi>Iac.</hi> or 21. <hi>Iac.</hi>
nor were theſe powers wherein they agreed
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:43196:50"/>
with the Commiſsion of Array complained of
by the Petition of Right, but rather admitted and
allowed, as We have already ſhewed. It may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well be inferred that both the Commiſsions
of Lievtenancy and of Array, (as to thoſe powers
at leaſt wherein they agreed) were Legall and
far from being any grievance to the Subject.</p>
            <p>Thus far we have proceeded in the Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and clearing of the Objections made againſt
Our Commiſsions of Array. Upon all which
Objections, we ſhall further obſerve That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Declaration denies Our power at
this day of commanding <hi>to Train or Exerciſe;</hi> yet
none of thoſe objections touch any thing upon
thoſe Powers. So that if all were true which is
objected, yet we ſhould ſtill have power (at leaſt
by a diſtinct Commiſsion) to command Our
Subjects to be Diſciplined, Muſtered, Trained
and Exerciſed, with ſuch Arms as they had in a
readineſſe; for that (as we have ſhewed before)
theſe are diſtinct from the power of <hi>Impoſing of
Arms,</hi> and may be ſeverally granted or execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>And now upon the whole matter, the ſtate
of Our caſe is this. It is Voted by Our Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:43196:50"/>
of Parliament, That Our Kingdom is in
imminent danger of deſtruction from enemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
and a diſcontented Party at home; and
that there is a neceſſity to put Our people into a
poſture of Defence.</p>
            <p>In this caſe, for defence of Our ſelves and Our
Kingdom, We have awarded Our Commiſsions
of Array, thereby giving power to the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners
(perſons, We hope, beyond exception)
to cauſe Our Subjects to arm themſelves, or, if
impotent in body, to find arms for others, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their abilities, in a reaſonable and
moderate proportion, and to muſter and train
them at convenient times and places, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
upon occaſion to lead them, where there
is a neceſsity for the defence of the Kingdom, and
the Expulſion, vanquiſhing, and Deſtruction of
Enemies.</p>
            <p>And We have ſhewed, That the Powers of
theſe Commiſsions, are grounded upon the very
principles of government, and that without
them, We could not defend and protect Our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
(as We are bound by Our oath at Our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation)
That they are warranted by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Common Law, allowed by the conſtant
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:43196:51"/>
practice of former ages eſtabliſhed by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4. (which cauſed a Copy of theſe
Commiſsions to be entred upon the Roll, as a
Rule or Preſident for after times) and are not
repealed, or altered by any Statutes now in
force.</p>
            <p>And yet, though this Danger, and the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of putting the Kingdome into a Poſture of
Defence, is thus agreed by both Houſes; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe,
this Commiſsion, and all others of like
nature, are by their Declaration ſaid to be ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall;
And it is thereby denied, That We have, at
any time, Power to charge Our Subjects with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
manner of Arms (though for the abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
defence of the Kingdom) or that We can
command them to be trained or exerciſed, much
leſſe to be led out of the County, though an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
be ready to enter, or though Rebels be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
up in Arms.</p>
            <p>How farre this opinion is conſiſtent with
Law, Reaſon, or Regall Power, the ſafety of Our
Selves and Our Subjects, (upon all this which
We have ſaid) We leave to all Our good people
to conſider.</p>
            <p>And ſince Our two Houſes (denying Us
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:43196:51"/>
this Power) without Us, and againſt Our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
have made Orders (which they call Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances)
for compelling Our Subjects to be Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
Trained, Exerciſed, Muſtered, and condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
and ſend for Our Subjects as Delinquents,
and impriſon them, for refuſing to obey ſuch
Orders; It is apparent, That what this Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſaith againſt Our Commiſsion, without juſt
ground, is true indeed of thoſe Orders, that is,
That they are contrary to the Law and Cuſtoms
of the Realm, deſtructive to the Liberty, and
Property of the Subjects, and contrary to the
Petition of Right (as it is expounded
in this Declaration,) as
alſo againſt other
Statutes.</p>
