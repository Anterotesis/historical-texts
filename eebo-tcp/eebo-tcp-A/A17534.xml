            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Foras I graunt that <hi>VIVA VOX,</hi> or (as Sainct <hi>Hierome</hi> saide) the liuely voyce of man doth most forcea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie enter into the harte, and effectually perswade, so can it not bee denied but that the wrightinges of godly men, through the secrete working of the holy spirite, doe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelously moue, and many times conuerte euen from disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute behauiour to honest conuersation, and from filthines of life to the feare of God.</p>
                  <p>This can they affirme to be true, which either in tyme of persecution could not, or in this prosperous and peaceable tyme of the Gospell, what through the grosse ignorance of some, or the too intolerable negligence of other Pastors, cannot be instructed, though greatlie they desire, and paie full deerely for the same. This can they affirme also (of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sorte, or calling) whiche make it their delight at idle tymes, to be conuersant in the holy Scripture, and to learn the counsaile of the Lord in the wrightinges of good men. And this can they affirme, which be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Whereby it is apparent, how iniurious they are to their brethren, how vngratefull to their countrie, how wicked
<pb facs="tcp:7523:3"/>
against God, whiche mislike, speake, inueigh against the bringing either of the worde of God, or the workes of good men agreable to his wil, into Ã  common tongue. As though that either God could be too muche honored, or godlinesse of too many practised: as though vertue could bee too common, or for some kinde of men to be vertuous were not commendable.</p>
                  <p>But sutch dealyng of theirs, doth euidently declare of what Religion they be. <hi>Iulian</hi> the Emperour did straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie forbid the workes of learned and good men to be peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of any Christian<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> But he was an Apostata, Ã  re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolter from the trueth, an enimie to the Crosse of Christe, Ã  blodie persecutor. The Turkes allowe no learning but their owne: But they are spoilers of good men, and sworne enemies to the truth. If these men were not either against true Religion aduersaries; or in conuersation, wicked, truely they colde well abide the light of the Gospell to shine ouer all. For there is no suche token of a giltie conscience as to shunne the light. And therefore they loue darknesse, because their deedes are euill. That policie of <hi>Iulian</hi> did more abolish the truth, than all his persecution: That pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of the Turkes hath destroyed moe soules, than any crueltie vppon their bodies could haue done: This deuilish counsaile of Sathans lyms hath doen more harme to the Church of Christ in England and in other Countries, and may doe more, if it should be followed, than any feare, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got, or force can bring to passe. But that Apostata <hi>Iulian</hi> being wounded to the death, could say at the length, <hi>Vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti Galilaee,</hi> Christe thou doste preuaile: The Turkes for all their tyrannie haue not their will: And in spight of of the deuill, the Gospell doth and shall florish euerlasting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie. The truth may be oppressed; the mouthes of good spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers may bee stopped; the beste Preachers may be lothed; Wolues and hirelinges may come in: nay, though there be,
<pb facs="tcp:7523:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in many places hirelinges in stede of true shepherdes, and good men (peraduenture for their owne synnes, or for the sinnes of the people peraduenture) bee lothed, though the mouthes of some through Mammon be stopped, yet will the promise and purpose of God take place, his seruauntes shalbe instructed, his enemies shalbee tolde their faultes, all shall knowe their dueties towardes God, their Prince, their betters, their equals, their inferiours, themselues, though not by wordes of mouthe, yet by wrighting: that both the godly may bee confirmed in the trueth, and the graceles conuerted in tyme and be saued. And therfore doth God in these daies, more than at any time, and in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande (verie strangely if it be well considered) stir vp, and incense the mindes of some to wright, of others to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late: whereby as wee enioie externall happines more than many nations about vs, so are wee blessed with the ritches of the soule more than all the world againe.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is (right honorable) that as other thinges I haue doen, so of late I translated, and nowe haue publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed this Treatise against Usurie. A vice as horrible afore GOD as hurtefull to Ã  Common-weale: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as necessarie to bee knowen, both of subiectes to shunne it, and of Magistrates seuerely to punish it, as may bee. A vice whiche none but infidels will vse, and no godlie men can abide. And yet Ã  vice whiche In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels detest, and Christians, so called, in deede no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, delight in. A vice whiche among the Turkes and Indians is not allowed: and so odious among the Iewes, as they vse it not, but towardes strangers. A vice so vnkno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen in tymes past, that to finde an Usurer in Ã  Cittie was Ã  woonder: and if any were so diuelishlie bent as to take Vsurie, he sware the giuer neuer to descriehym. If but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny probable suspicion rose of Ã  man to occupie that filthie trade, he was taken for Ã  deuill in the likenes of Ã  man: his
<pb facs="tcp:7523:4"/>
house was called the deuils house, all that hee had was counted the deuils: and therefore while he liued of all sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes hee was abhorred: the Bayes in the streates would not come nigh hym, the men would not deale with him, the women feared hym, the Preestes barred hym from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Supper of the Lorde, and when he was dead, he was v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed like Ã  Dogge, he had no Christian buriall.</p>
                  <p>But good Lorde, howe is the Worlde chaunged? That whiche Infidels can not abyde, Gospellers allowe. That whiche the Iewes take onelie of straungers, and will not take of their owne Countreimen for shame, that doe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians take of their deere freindes, and thinke for so doing they deserue greate thankes. That whiche afore tyme men durst not vse but secretly, that in these da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>es bringeth men to estimation. That whiche a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tyme was vsed of verie fewe, that in these daies is practised almoste of all, and made an occupation. I feare mee that many occupiers in the world which can not liue by their law full trade and beare Ã  countenance, do main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine themselues by Vsurie. I feare mee that many officers whose allowance is but verie small, and their liuing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all besides, are iolie fellowes, and that by Usurie. I feare mee, that many gentlemen whose reuenues are but simple, can bring mighty things to passe, &amp; that by Vsurie.</p>
                  <p>I would this were all (although that were intolerable). But I would that among occupieres many, whiche hauing good trades whereby they may liue well, yet for greedines of more gaine, did not leaue their lawfull callinges, and liue onely by Usurie: I woulde that among sutche as are called gentlemen, many whiche haue liuinges, and may keepe good houses, did not either sell all, or forsake their home to come into populous townes and liue by Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: I would that many whom God hath blest with rit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches

of this worlde, whereby they may procure good and commendable trades to liue by, refused not them to liue by Vsurie. And when I consider these thinges, I maruell with my selfe why suche enquirie is made for vagabondes, and none at all for these men, why poore wretches are straightlie examined how they do liue; and these fellowes come not into question: I maruell, and sure I cannot suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficientlie maruell, why that Roages are burnt in the care, and Theeues are hanged, and yet these suffer no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilie punishment at all. Roages leaue honest waies of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and that wilfullie, and so doe these: Roages liue by idlenes, and the sweat of other mens browes, and so doe these. And therefore being as bad as Roages, they well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue the punishment of Roages. Yea, but Roages lacke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But Vsurers lacke some honestie which Roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges haue, and therefore more horrible. There is lightlie no Roage, but either his Raiment, or his talke, or his companie whiche hee keepeth, or some one thing or other, descerneth hym from an honest man: But an Vsurer is Ã  Wolfe in Ã  Lambes skinne, Ã  Mermaide with Ã  mans voyc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Againe, thefte is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, and Theeues by good politike lawes are put to death by hanging. Usurie is theeuerie (as out of the word of God, and the learned bookes of good men hereafter shal be proued:) and therefore Vsurers like theeues deserue to be hanged. And surelie that is to good for them. For if simple theeues, whiche robbe most commonly for neede, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their wils, in feare, in out places, secretlie, straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, deserue suche Ã  death, how should they be handled, whiche haue no neede, and yet will steale, and that impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently without blushing, in famous places, openly, and from their freindes? Surelie these twoo are so like, that the one
<pb facs="tcp:7523:5"/>
in respect of the other may after Ã  sorte, be pardoned.</p>
                  <p>And yet I would this were all, I would it rested one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in particular men (although it should bee in none) I would it stretched not to whole companies, and Parishes. But I certainlie beleue (so farre is the Canker spred) if diligent and secrete enquirie were made, that the stocke of many Churches would bee founde out at Vsurie, and the poore releeued by that shamefull gaine: and that the common Treasure of some companies doeth yere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie encrease by this deuilishe trade; and yong occupiers, or other honest men fallen in decaie, whiche should accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to the willes of well desposed persones freely bee hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, paie deerely for the vse thereof. A thyng so againste reason, and the Religion whiche wee professe, as, almoste, nothyng can bee more.</p>
                  <p>But what is the cause of all these mischiefes? Truely nothing els, but (as the honourable now for his auctoritie, alwaies for his vertue, learnyng, and loue of his countrie honorable Maister Doctour <hi>Wilson</hi> in his excellent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse vppon this matter saied) the lacke of penall statu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. O that it would please your honour to thinke here of (as I hope you doe, and will) and consider how God hereby is dishonored; the glorie of this countrie obscured; honest men beggered; roages and theeues maintained; hospitali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie hindered; charitie extinguished, religion defaced, and withall consider vppon some notable punishementes for these rotten and vnprofitable members, your glory should bee greater in bryngyng that to passe, than euer was the glorie of <hi>Hercules</hi> for killyng the Monsters of his tyme.</p>
                  <p>It was an olde Prophesie among the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> that the loue of money should bryng the destruction of <hi>Sparta:</hi> and therefore to preserue that citie the better (as <hi>Erasmus</hi> noteth) thei appoincted that he should lose his life, that brought any money into that Common-weale.
<pb facs="tcp:7523:6"/>
Notwithstanding good lawes through wicked Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes in tyme were neglected; good counsaile not regarded; couetousnesse crept in, and Vsurie was so common, as rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men thereby became beggers, and fre-men bondslaues. The which though many lamented, yet most of al greeued <hi>Agesilaus</hi> (a noble capitain among the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi>) and therefore complained vnto the Kyng, and by sute ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that the accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t, or notory bookes of Vsurers should bee openly burnte vp: whiche was brought to passe. A no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table punishemente for those coruorant Vsurers. <hi>Cicero</hi> thinketh (of whose opinion I am) that it is Ã  Prophesie not for <hi>Sparta</hi> alone, but for all wealthy cities &amp; Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>monwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les: and it maie bee for certaine, that that state is not of continuance, where vice is embraced, and vertue bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed; couetousnesse crepte in, and care of godlinesse caste out; Usurie allowed, and lawfull trades of liuyng not maintained. Now, Vsurie beeyng growen to suche a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte ripenes in <hi>Englande,</hi> as almoste there is no man, but, if he haue spare money, out it muste, whereby honeste men become beggers, and (though not in suche sorte as thei were at <hi>Sparta</hi>) the vertuous become, in effecte, bond slaues, to the veriest slaues by Nature, whiche thyng full many doe greuouslie lament, if it would please your honor (as noble Ã  capitaine in <hi>Englande,</hi> as euer <hi>Agesilaus</hi> was in <hi>Sparta</hi>) to procure Ã  redresse hereof, I doubt not, but as the realme should bee deliuered from Ã  marueilous slaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in the tyme present, so it would bee Ã  cause that GOD should blesse this lande exceadyngly in the tyme to come.</p>
                  <p>I wish not (honourable:) not that their bookes of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countes should be consumed with fire, whiche the valiant mynde of <hi>Agesilaus</hi> brought to passe; nor that the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall should not bee repaied, muche lesse an ouerplus paied, whiche punishemente <hi>Plato</hi> did appointe; nor that they should haue Ã  double punishment more than theeues had,

Wherefore in as much as out of the word of God I haue learned, what may be thought of the exacting of Vsurie, I haue labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for my calling sake diligentlie to teache, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully too admonishe men, that they take heede of the same. For nothing is more hurtfull either to our state in this world, or to our soules and bodies for euer; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more against the state of Common-weales, or sooner bringeth them to decaye. And for that I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that, in these latter, and most perilous times of the worlde, in whiche all thinges are inclined to deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng and scrapyng together, men are so blinded, that notwithstandyng the wonderfull cleerenes of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell, contrarie to so many, and so euident testimonies of holy scripture, contrarie to so many sentences of the

reuerend Doctors, contrarie to so many lawes both of countries, and of nature, yea &amp; contrary to the opinions of the very Pagans, they allowe, exercise, and contende that the profite by Vsurie is lawfull gaine: I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded so far in this matter, that in my confession now extant, I haue by euident testimonies of the Scriptures, of godly fathers, and of the Lawe, proued, that Vsurie as a thing which bringeth to the soule infection, to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweales destruction, to mankind the wrath of God, and maketh them subiect to the tyranny of Sathan, and eternall miserie and destruction, is greatly to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, and to be forbidden. Which my exhortation how it hath been taken, is so wel knowen to al your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, or at least to the moste of you, that I neede not at this tyme to mention the same. In the defence of which confession (whiche when tyme shall serue we will giue out) this matter shall more copiously be handled.</p>

To reprehende, or, more truely to speake, to cauill is no harde thing, but to shewe the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, that is troublesome.</p>

For the holy Scripture serues me better to victory, than the plausible sentences of all the world. I trust this my dedication wilbe gratefully accepted of you all, because it was first begon, and is now finished for the profit of my countrie, and for the propagation and defence of the trueth.</p>
                  <p>The discourse of barganing I haue therfore preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, which I would haue the discrete reader to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande, especially because this matter of Vsurie tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth our profession, whiche I would take vppon mee to handle with wisedome, deliberation, and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                        <p>Vsurie is Ã  gaine aboue the principall, exacted onely for the duetie of lendyng. For when Ã  detter hath giuen Ã  cause of losse, if he make a recompence for the hinderance whiche his Creditor is come into by his meanes, suche Ã 
<pb facs="tcp:7523:27"/>
gaine is not Vsurie, or vnlawfull. But that gaine is Usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and vnlawfull, whiche is gotten onely for the loane of lendyng, when no daunger or hinderaunce is come by the lendyng.</p>
                        <p>This definition would bee knowen, and rightlie vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode, that so the lawes and reasons forbiddyng Usurie, maie the more easely bee perceiued. For thus it is expresly saied: Thou shalte not put thy Money to Vsurie to thy brother. Againe: Thou shalt lende to thy brother without<note place="margin">Deut. 23.</note> Usurie. Againe in the Psalme: He whiche hath not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen his money to Vsurie. And Christe saieth, Lende, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king<note place="margin">Psal. 15.</note> for nothyng therby. For when he saith lende, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth<note place="margin">Luke 6. Vsurie forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by the lawe of God.</note> not to giue, but will haue the principall to bee rendred. For otherwise it were no lendyng. And the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell doeth not take awaie lawfull contractes, but the lawe is there repeated, whiche forbiddeth to aske any thyng a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue that whiche is lente, in consideration of the lendyng.</p>
                        <p>These testimonies do shew, that by the lawe of God the demaunding of Vsurie is forbidden. Now confirmed by sutch auctoritie, let vs consider naturall reason. Generally<note place="margin">Vsurie vnlawful euen by naturall reason.</note> in all necessarie contractes God will haue equalitie to bee obserued, lest one part beeyng dronke vp and consumed, the other become fat. And for this cause hath God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed an equalitie, to warne vs, that in hym likewise iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice or equalitie is. Now in Usurie equalitie is not obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, beecause that one partie doth receiue a greate deale more than hee gaue, as the giuer doth mutually receaue the principall, and for nothing Vsurie besides, and that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes greate Vsurie. Therefore equalite is not kepte, but one parte is dronke out, as the proofe showeth, daylie men are brought to beggerie, and sometime whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries vndoen by sutche extreme exactions.

Knowe you that this also is the ordinance of God, whiche hee will haue to bee faithfullie obserued both of the Creditor, and of the Detter, that neither the Lender desire vnlawfull gaines inrespecte of his lending, nor the borrower retaine any thing of that whiche is due. And so therefore hath God ordained that both creditor and borrower should bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained within the bondes that he hath prescribed.</p>
                        <p>The creditor whiche lendeth should not enriche hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe by the couenantes of Vsurie, neither demaunde more than he doth lende, nor enrich him selfe by an other mans goodes. For the lawe of God saieth plainlie: Feare God,<note place="margin">Leuit. 25.</note> that thy brother may liue with thee: thou shalt not take vsury of thy brother, neither more than thou gauest. And in the Psalme it is saide: Who shall dwell in thy Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,<note place="margin">Psalme. 15.</note> &amp;c. Hee whiche hath not giuen his Money vpon vsurie. Also in Ezechiel there is a most bitter curse; He<note place="margin">Ezech. 18.</note> which sinneth shall die the death, which is referred to the Vsurer impudently exacting more than he lente. Besides, Christ saieth, Lende, looking for nothing thereby. Whiche<note place="margin">Luke. 6.</note> saiyng should not so peruerslie or foolishly bee vnderstode, that one might reason thereby, that the principall, or that whiche in lente should not be repaied. For then it were no lending but a giuing, if the Principall might not bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded.

In lendyng the Lawe of Nature dooeth require, that more than the principall nothyng should bee receiued: and if it fortune that thy neighbour bee oppressed with suche pouertie and wretchednesse, that he lacketh not onely wherewith to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paie thee, but also famisheth for want of relief, there the charitie of thy neighbour, whereunto wee are called by the law of Nature, doeth require, that not onely thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and forgiue hym his debt, but also that thou succour, and releiue him bountifully by the aboundaunce of thy o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther goodes, accordyng to that interpretation of Christe, Lende, looking for nothyng thereby.

                        <p>
                           <hi>Nicolas Hemingius an excellent diuine of Hasfnis in Denmarke, saith notablie of Vsurie in this wise:</hi> It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that Vsurie may not bee excused. For vsurie is a gaine of anie thing aboue that which was lente, exacted in consideration of the loane: hence doth <hi>Ambrose</hi> saie: That meate is vsurie, apparell is vsurie, and whatsoeuer is more than that which was lent, is vsury, howsoeuer you call the same, it is vsurie. Neither is any distinction of v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie to bee made contrarie to the Lawe of Nature, and word of God. For there be some whiche deuide vsurie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this maner, and say that there is an vsurie oppressing the Neighbour, and another vsurie pleasuring, not hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and therefore lawfull. And this diuision they thinke is confirmed by the Hebrue worde, whereby vsury is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Nesec,</hi> which commeth of biting. But for that this is Ã  plaine Grammaticall distinction, I aunswere first, that v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie is not onely called <hi>Nesec</hi> of the Hebrues from by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but also <hi>Marbith</hi> and <hi>Tarbith</hi> from profite, or gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. <hi>Leuit. 25.</hi> Thou shalt not giue thy Meate <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bith,</hi> that is, vppon vsurie. Also: take not of him <hi>Nesec</hi> and <hi>Tarbith</hi> that is, vsurie and prosite. For by the latter worde the former is expounded, to wit, anie profit or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, whiche excedeth the principall. Secondly I say, that
<pb facs="tcp:7523:31"/>
the forbiddings of Vsurie are generall. And therefore as this distinction is but weake, so it cannot excuse or cleare the conscience of an vsurer. Therefore muche better did Aristotle thinke, who saide: That vsury is against nature. Againe, when more is receiued than was deliuered, there is not Arithmeticall proportion obserued, whiche conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually should be kept in lendings. <hi>Ezechiel</hi> in his 18. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter saith plainly, that he is Ã  iuste man, and shall liue that giueth not vpon vsurie, and doth not take ouerplus. So by Ã  contrarie it followeth: that he is an euill man whiche doth exercise vsurie.</p>
                        <p>But subtile men seeke many shiftes, and boaste that in lendyng vpon Vsurie, thei benefite their neighbours, and so moste impudently vnder the name of vertue, thei cloke their Vsurie, and account the same as Ã  charitable deede. Thei saie, that Ã  poore man is many tymes become riche by the money whiche he borroweth vpon Vsurie. But God is not deceiued by Sophistrie, neither doeth he allowe wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked cloakes. And therefore if thou contemneste the lawe of God, and of Charitie, thou hast altogether made Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke of thy faithe. Wherefore against all the argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of suche as countenaunce this wicked dealynges of V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surers, set this rule: Of Vsurie wee maie not iudge accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to the profite or hurte of hym whiche paieth Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, but accordyng to the woorde of God; to the Lawe of Nature; and to the affection of the takers. The woorde of God should bee the rule of our life, the same worde cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the mynde of an Vsurer Ã  Theefe, and sheweth that it is voyde of charitie towardes his neighbours. Therefore the excuse of man taketh no place here: for of synnes wee must iudge accordyng to the woorde of God.

                        <p>Sith it is vnlawfull, saith <hi>Melancthon,</hi> to take vsurie, it is necessary that restitution should be made, whan it may be doen: for as long as one wittingly and willinglie doth retaine anothers goodes, so long doth he remaine Ã  theefe, or stealer. And <hi>Paule</hi> saieth, hee whiche hath stolen, let him steale no more.

he which hath stolen, is so long a theefe, as he willinglie and wittingly doth detaine that which is another mans.

An example: as not to forgiue him which keepeth anothers wife, belongeth to contrition: so to restore anothers goodes is Ã  part of contrition, because contrition is Ã  greefe and sorrowe for sinne with Ã  purpose afterwarde not to commit any thing against conscience, and the commaundement of God.</hi>

                        <p>May any thing aboue that which is lent be demaunded, saith Melancthon, in consideration of the hinderance had by the le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>dyng of the same? I au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>swere: that is called interest
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7523:34"/>
which is due to a man, either because he is endamaged<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> or because some gaine is indeede loste by the lendyng. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is interest distinguished: for it riseth either from da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>myng<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> or from gaine risyng. For example: if one is bounde to paie me twentie crounes at the Calendes of Maye, and doth not: if I through his disapointing mee runne into any daunger, as if I should haue paied the same to another at that very tyme, here is it meete that equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie be obserued, in that he gained by mine: but equalitie is not obserued, if he by my lending be made ritche, and I by his breaking daie bee made poore: that is called Interest for the damage arising.</p>
                        <p>Also this difference is necessarilie to bee noted: One damage happeneth before the day appointed for paiment; another chaunceth when the debtor breaketh daie. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let this be the first aunswere: The true and verie In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest indeede, whiche cometh to the lender, is, when da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage ariseth through not keeping daie. As if one should paie me twentie Crownes at the Calendes of Maye, and by reason he doth not so, I am damnified. Here the reason of equalitie doth require that recompence be made.</p>
                        <p>In such Ã  case we pronounce that besides the principall as much is due, as the creditor hath lost through the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage arising, although no couenaunt haue passed aboute the Interest, that is agreable to the lawe written, and to naturall equity. For he which giueth Ã  cause of losse, ought to make a recompence. And therefore is it equitie, that sutch Interest be paide. By this case it may bee seen what is true and good Interest, which the lender may take, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is due though no couenauntes bee made. For it is manifest that equalitie is not there obserued, where gaine is gotten by lending.</p>
                        <p>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>cerning gaine cessing after delaie, that is, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor doth not pay at his tyme appointed, the same sentence
<pb facs="tcp:7523:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is giuen<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> that Interest is due, as we saide it was by damage arising. But yet in this seconde case the same is graunted onely to occupiers: whiche is good reason, for to hinder the trade of occuping is to giue Ã  greate cause of hinderance. <hi>This doth Melancthon say.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And let there be sutch Interest. For, as Luther saieth:</hi> To recompence Ã  damage is not to giue or take more than the principall: but it is an hurt whiche cometh to the len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der contrarie to his will, whereby hee is compelled to aske Ã  recompence.</p>

can bryng to death, these doe they thinke by your au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, by your zeale, and iudgementes to oppresse.</p>
                     <p>For these beyng throwen out of their places, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued from their charge, and banished out of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, suppose there is an entraunce shewed them to all extortion, so that none dare set themselues againste them, or controll their desire. For who knoweth not, that in their wicked attempt they raise sedition against the Lorde himselfe? For the word whiche forbiddeth and condemneth Vsurie, is not the worde of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, but of God, committed to the Ministers to be si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnified to the worlde.</p>
                     <p>And fearing not God, thinke ye they would reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence your power and auctoritie if they were able for strength to rebell? Nay credite mee they woulde aswell driue you from all gouernment, as they are bold to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest the ministers.</p>
                     <p>Which thing that it fall not out, it standeth you vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon to prouide and see that their greedie mindes bee bridled, and that their craftie and wicked conspiracies take no place. The which will come to passe if careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and with all your endeuour you studie that the word of God may be syncerely preached by the faithfull mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters. For therefore is peace established that in it the people be instructed in the knowledge of God. And if that be doen, I doubt not but their bolde speech wilbee suppressed, and through the hearing the paynes bothe temporall and eternall whiche they get vnto them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues by vsurie, they will returne into the way of truth, and by hartie repentaunce conuerted, will giue vnto God his due honor, to you humble obedience, and to euerie man his owne.</p>
                     <p>But if for the reprehension of vsurie you shall suffer the Preachers to be troubled, tossed, and banished, your

paines shall bee greate, and your bondage miserable, whiche you shall procure.</p>
                     <p>For in breaking the lawe of Nature, and of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, whiche forbid Vsurie, they go about to cut of the cheife staie of iustice. And because magistracie is the defence of the lawe, who seeth not that Vsurers by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little come to that boldnes and impudencie, that godlines beyng despised, the lawes defaced, and all their strength ouerthrowen, yea and ritches, whiche are the instrumentes wherby any thing is brought to passe, hourded vp in their cofers, they will rule the rost, and gouerne alone.</p>
                     <p>Finallie, thei disturbe the peace and tranquillitie, while thei require more than thei gaue, by whiche ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie one partie is eaten out, and brought into mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, the other is made fat: and so the publike peace is broken, and humane societie cometh to decaie.</p>
                     <p>So you see, into what perilles the Churche, your sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, and the whole Commonweale is like to fall into, if by publike auctoritie this vice of Vsurie bee not spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delie abolished.</p>
                     <p>For the Preachers, without speedie remedie, are like to come in daunger, and bee banished, whiche beeyng gone, how will you learne to knowe God, to praie tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to comfort your soules, and to leade an honest life in the sight of God?

                     <p>Againe if any of vs, whiche would shewe our selues faithful as becommeth the ministers of the word, do set our selues against you, because we like not of your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and behauiour, esteemyng rather the glorie of God the commaundement of Christe, the edifiyng of the Churche and the testimonie of Ã  good conscience, than your good will or fauour, then spreade you many slaunders against the truth against well gouerned chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, against the faithfull Preachers, and against those Commonweales which courteously receiue vs. What should pratling contende with pietie, and adde besides contumelious detractions of the well disposed?

For if you would ioyne with vs, as you should, and so with all your strength beset this Idoll, no doubt but wee should lesse bee slaundered, lesse iniured, and the auctoritie of gouernours the better resisted.</p>
                     <p>But sith one alloweth, an other condemneth Vsurie, what men should like thei knowe not. But rather thei suppose that Vsurie is a thyng lawfull and sufferable, and that men inueigh against the same, either through ambition, or enuie, or vainglorie, or emulation, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie when thei heare the reproches, wherewith the faithfull preachers bee vnworthelie afflicted.</p>
                     <p>O shamelesse boldnesse, and horrible impietie, that man created after the likenesse of God, and placed in suche an high estate of dignitie, should bee so spoyled of discretion, that for transitorie commodities of this life, and vncertaine goodes, he will reiecte the glorie of his God, the admonitions of zealous Preachers, &amp; their owne, yea, and others eternall saluation, and wilfullie caste them selues, and others by their example into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall destruction.</p>
                     <p>Now you whiche are the faithfull Ministers of God

and fight couragiouslie for the maintenaunce of his truth against the idoll of Mammon, you I counsaile and beseeche, that ye saint not, nor bee ouercome by reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linges, slaunders, and afflictions, but that you remaine constant and perseuere, strengthned by sweete conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Ã  good conscience for your faithfulnes made manifest, and stirred through an hope of attainyng a crowne of glorie, wherewith all which vnder Christ in this spirituall warfare haue fighten, in the latter daye of this world shalbe adorned.</p>
                     <p>Finallie, ouerpassyng others, with whom my words are of small force either for their auctoritie, wherbi any thyng they suppose is lawfull for them to doe, or for their obstinate impietie that they will not repente.

whereby at this tyme he doth violentlie inuade and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set the whole world, that by a filthy custome of getting and heaping ritches together he may drawe men from godlines, and make them subiect to eternall tormentes. Wherefore I warne you to take heede, and diligently to note and consider what goodnes and truth is in this cause.</p>
                     <p>First place before your eyes the straight commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes of God forbidding Vsurie, which are not idle imaginations proceeding from the braine of Ministers, but seuerely proposed of God himselfe, for the better direction of our life in this world.</p>
                     <p>And what Ã  foolishe boldnes were it to resiste the almightie God, and as it were to contende in battaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst hym? In a common weale to contemne Ã  Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate and good statutes, is accounted intolerable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, and therefore with greate punishment is se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerely looked vnto: and then with what paines shall they bee tormented, whiche contende with God, by contemning his lawes?</p>
                     <p>Againe, consider that the cheifest parte of our office is to preache repentaunce, and that we may not, though we would, cloake, or keepe secret those thinges whiche are contained in the monuments of the Prophetes and Apostles, and haue continually by the prouidence of God been obserued and kepte in greate alterations of Empires, thereby the better to bee knowen to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, and be witnes of his pleasure.</p>
                     <p>Likewise haue in mynde, that God will, yea and hath straightlie commaunded, that we loue our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as ourselues, and shewe vnto hym all maner of curtesie, which thing he hath promised to recompence as if it had been extended to hym selfe. But he whiche occupieth Vsurie, doth in deede proue that he loueth
<pb facs="tcp:7523:46"/>
not his neighbour. And therefore an Vsurer, as muche as in hym lieth, doth take away and abolish the cheifest bonde of humane societie, and the greatest argument and signe of faith.</p>
                     <p>The fruite of your well doyng is the fauour of God, the quietnes of conscience, and vnspeakeable happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, whiche how greate the same is, iudge, you.</p>
                     <p>Then how are you bewitched, and giuen ouer to wickednesse, that will hate and abhorre them worser than Ã  Toade, which faithfully execute their office, and bring you both eternall and transitorie ritches?</p>
                     <p>And as the nomber of them is not small whiche con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne and reprehende Vsurie in these daies (as afore we haue declared:) so doe the learned and godly in, and after the Apostles tyme mightely inueigh against the same: whiche is an argument of the certaintie of my doctrine, and sufficient either for confirmation of the trueth, or confutation of the contrarie.</p>
                     <p>And therefore bee not ye moued with the ianglyng wordes of Sycophantes, which to make our cause odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and to be abhorred, crie with open mouthes, that certaine obscure and base persons, and those verie fewe for nomber pricked with selfeloue, ambition and enuie, do rayse I know not what tumultes and tragedies, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be knowne, and to get an estimation among men. For you se the woorde of God, and the witnes of the learned doe easely proue that they be euill dealers and priuie slaunderers.</p>

                     <p>Consider besides the infirmitie of man, the notyng whereof ought to bee of sufficient force to extinguishe the flames of couetousnesse.

                     <p>Therfore, if ye thinke and perswade your selues that you are made to the image of God, redeemed by the sonne, and sanctified by the holy ghost, that you might glorifie God, if ye like reasonable men thinke that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is due to the commaundementes of God and good lawes: if ye beleue those thinges whiche are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in the bookes of the Prophetes and Apostles to be true, certaine; and the will of God not fables: If ye thinke that credit should bee giuen to the testimonies of so many lerned men, if you suppose the world not to be made of moates, as <hi>Democritus</hi> did, but to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by the prouidence of God, as good Christians doe: if ye thinke that all sustenance for this life is mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred vnto vs by the liberall hand of almightie God: if ye thinke ye are created not for this short life, but for an euerlasting: if you perswade your selues that eternall tormentes are prepared for all sutche as are impenitent, and turne not to the Lorde, but wittinglie and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perseuere in vngodlines against their conscience, and

For it may not be thought that the Gospell doth either breake the lawfull bondes of humane societie, or disanull necessarie helpes to the maintenance of man. But, for that by experience we see that many both in the gettyng, possessing, and vsing of ritches, do offende, and muche ill dealing is in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes: it will not be amisse to giue out such lessons, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the godly disposed person may know both how to attaine ritches commendably without offence to God, and beyng attained to vse them vertuously, as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth Ã  Christian: and also to deale so in the contractes now vsed, as neither hymselfe shalbe troubled with giltines of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>science, nor his neighbour hindred, much lesse impouerished, by extreme oppression.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore first of all this rule of Christe muste care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully<note place="margin">A necessarie rule to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued of al men. Math. 6.</note> bee obserued: <hi>Seeke ye firste the kingdome of God</hi>

                        <hi>and his righteousnes, and other thinges shalbe ministred vnto you.</hi> This rule containeth twoo thinges, to wit, Ã <note place="margin">Two thinges contained in this rule of Christe. 1.

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, as he is not in the fauour of God, so is he Ã  subiect vnto synne, Ã  slaue to Sathan, whose ende, and stipende is eternall destruction. Therefore it behoueth vs principally to obeye this commaundement, and to haue Ã  care of our saluation. The promise is, <hi>And other thinges shalbe ministred vnto you.</hi> This promise doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire<note place="margin">2. The promise.</note> first of all, faithe, whereby we may certainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade our selues, that Christe is both true of promise,<note place="margin">Faith.</note> and readie to performe if we obeye his Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and afterward though not expresly, that euerie man do, through faith, diligentlie without Hethenishe<note place="margin">Diligence in our calling.</note> and worldly carefulnes, sutche thinges as by his calling hee lawfully may. For we may not thinke that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of Christe doth commende idlenes vnto vs.<note place="margin">Idlenes vnmete for a Christian.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>But lest any man should through ignorance doubt, whether his calling be good or no, I will in fewe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des declare what is necessarie to Ã  lawfull calling. Two<note place="margin">VVhat are to be considered in Ã  calling. VVhat callinges are lawfull in Ã  Commonweale.</note> thinges generally are to be considered, to wit, the kynd of calling, and the discharge of the same. Touchyng the kinde of callyng this rule is to be kept in minde. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie calling or office, making to the maintenaunce or fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing of the states ordained of God, as are the state of Ã  Commonweale, of an Householde, and of the Church, are commaunded in the first and fourth Commaundement, as is the calling of Ministers, of Magistrates, of Officers vnder Magistrates, of Householders, of Artificers, of Merchauntes: breefly, all callinges whiche serue to the good ordering of the Churche, of an householde, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale,</hi>

                        <hi>are both in themselues good, and also commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable in sutch as lawfullie are in them.</hi> And although it<note place="margin">A difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene Ã  publike and priuate cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> be free for euerie man to chuse the kinde of life where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he feeleth hymself inclined, yet ought we to make Ã  difference betweene Ã  callyng priuate, and Ã  publike calling. Vnto a publike office we must come by ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie calling. For no man should take vpon him Ã  publike<note place="margin">A publike office maie not bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken without or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie calling.</note> office either in the Churche or Commonweale, vnlesse he be called thereunto by ordinarie auctority: he which doth otherwise sinneth against God, and is without all comforte of the holy spirite in tyme of persecution. Wherfore let euery good man beware that he rush not into any publike office without lawfull callyng. The<note place="margin">Priuate calling.</note> priuate callyng, any man, as him liketh, may chuse: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in thys also the good counsaile of Parentes ought not to be contemned.

                     <p>In the discharge of the office or callyng, many thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges<note place="margin">VVhat are to be considered of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie man in the discharge of his calling.

                        </note> are to be considered. Firste faith and charitie should be the rules of all our dealinges. Faith is wary of displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing God, and doth referre all thinges to his glory: cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie warneth that no man bee iniuried, but profited. Faith defireth God to be an assister: charitie maketh vs to loue our neighbour in the Lorde. Faithe keepeth Ã  worker in the feare of God: Charitie keepeth the same man in the loue of his neighbour. Thus if a man labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vprightly in his lawfull calling beecome ritche, through the blessyng of God, he ought singularlie too foresee, that his ritches become not snares and thornes vnto him, through his owne sinne.

The mind should not be altogether giuen to ritches, &amp; to couetousnes, neither ought Ã  Christian to measure his happines by the deceiptfull measure of ritches, but ought to vse them rightly, lest he lay snares for his owne destruction. Now when the minde is thus affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes ritches, it will haue Ã  care by and by how to vse the ritches wel which God hath giuen. Wherfore I will adioine hereunto somwhat of the lawful vse of ritches.</p>

And although fullie and at large to discourse of contractes belongeth to Lawiers, whiche by profession can wisely entreate hereof, yet notwithstandyng bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause politike lawes doe not alwaies satisfie the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of men, I thinke it good to prescribe Ã  shorte aduertisement whiche the godly may safely followe in all his bargaines.

And afterwarde I will declare the kindes of the cheifest contractes, and shew how they agree to the foresaid foundations.</p>
                     <p>The first foundation shall bee this, deriued from the<note place="margin">The first foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to be laide before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bargaine bee concluded. 1. Doe vnto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as you would be doen vnto. Doe not vnto another whiche you would not should be doen to your selfe. Math. 7.</note> lawe of nature: <hi>That whiche you would another should not doe vnto you, doe not vnto another. And contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, That whiche thou wouldest iustlie haue doen to thy selfe, doe vnto another.</hi> Vppon this foundation Christe will haue all dueties, yea and all dealinges and bargay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to be builded. For so he saieth: <hi>Whatsoeuer ye would that men should doe vnto you, euen so doe ye vnto them.</hi> He addeth Ã  reason of this foundation: <hi>This</hi> (saieth he) <hi>is the Lawe and the Prophetes,</hi> that is, this is the scope of the Lawe and Prophetes, or whatsoeuer the Lawe and the Prophetes commaund, is contained in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon rule. This foundation as in euery bargain it would
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7523:53"/>
haue plainnes, and excludeth double dealyng: so it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth equalitie betweene those whiche bargayne, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Arithmeticall proportion, which doth mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, nomber, and weigh all charges equallie. So suche Ã  contract is both equall, and lawfull: equall, because it obserueth an Arithmeticall proportion: and lawfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it agreeth to the lawe of nature.</p>
                     <p>The second foundation is this, taken from the nature<note place="margin">2. The Gospell al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth good politike lawes.</note> of the Gospell. The Gospell doth allowe such politike ordinances, as Ã  godlie magistrate doth iudge profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for his Commonweale. This is thereby euident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Apostles of Christ did, that we can reade, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer<note place="margin">The Apostles neuer set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues againste good ordinaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ge the forme of the publike ordinances where they preached, whiche vndoubtedly they would haue doen, had they been contrarie to the Gospell. Hence it followeth, that as Ã  godly man may vse the ciuile ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of that Commonweale, in whiche he liueth, so is it lawfull for Ã  wise magistrate to make necessarie lawes for his Commonweale according to which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractes, and the callinges of this life may be directed,<note place="margin">Bargaines are commendable as long as they agree to godly statutes in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weales.</note> but notwithstanding no lawe is to be enacted contrarie to the lawe of nature, or commaundementes of God.</p>
                     <p>These two foundations I would haue to bee applied to all contractes, as it were consultations, whiche maye giue sentence as often as one question ariseth about bargaining.</p>
                     <p>The kindes of ciuile contractes, whereof we mynde<note place="margin">The kindes of bargaines spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in this booke.</note> to speake at this tyme, are these. 1. Exchange of thinges. 2. Bying and sellyng. 3. Lending. 4. Commodation. 5. Letting forth to hire. 6. The contract of societie. If there be any other contractes, they may bee knowen in the wrightinges of Lawiers, whiche may bee embraced of Ã  godly minde, as long as they decree nothing either against the loue towardes God, or charitie towardes

deede it bee moste intolerable, yet many doe but laugh thereat. For he whiche exerciseth Vsurie, is no doubte excluded from the familie of God, and congregation of true Christians.

Which maketh Ã  scoffe at the woorde of God? Now thei whiche are not of the body of Christ shall haue no portion in the treasure of Sainctes, which is more pretious than al the riches of this worlde.
