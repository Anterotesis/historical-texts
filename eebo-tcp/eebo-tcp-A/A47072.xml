            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>This is Lights appearance in the Truth
to all the precious dear Lambs of the
Life Dark vanished, Light
shines forth: Set forth by Sarah Iones.</head>
            <p>DEar Lambs, whom the Father hath visited with his
eternal love, this is the Message of the Lord unto you
from that word which shall endure for ever, that ye sink
down into that eternal word, and rest there, and not in any
manifestations, that proceeds from the word, for it is the
word of the Lord once more mentioned, that shall endure
for ever, and those that are gathered into it; and so dear
babes, this is the testimonie of the Fathers love, that ye may
not rest short of himself through, one who the Lord God hath
brought, and is a bringing to the loss of all things, that I may
be found in him; which eternal word was before manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were, and this is the word that the builder refuses, which
is become the head of the corner. Dear babes, read and tell
me within, for those that build upon the manifestations, and
not upon that that manifests, sets up an Idol in the heart,
which the Lord God will shortly throw down: Dear babes,
not that the manifestation from the Spirit of truth is denyed,
for whatsoever is manifested or revealed to the Creature, it
is to lead it to the substance, and so that soul and spirit that
sinks down into it, it works and levens into its own creature,
and it will work out the nature which is contrary to divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
what proceeds from it is holy and pure, so let not your
eyes nor minds be gathered into the manifestations, but sink
down into that measure of life that ye have received, and
go not out with your in-looking at what is contrary in you, for
if you do you will miss of the power that should destroy it,
for as ye keep in that which is pure, which is the eternal word
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:31761:2"/>
of the Lord, which is nigh in your hearts, it will work and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
so, that it will overcome what is contrary: And so,
you, dear babes, that are little and weak in your own eyes, to
you is this message sent, look not at your own weakness, but
look at him who is calling you in his eternal love, who will
make the weak strong, and will pull down the mighty from
their seat. Ah my soul, canst not thou say so by experience?
yes surely; and so, dear babes, reason not with flesh and blood,
nor with the voice of the Serpent, for if you do, you will
darken the council of God in your selves, but in the power of
the Lord shut him out, for it makes in hir a state of inoncence;
had <hi>Eve</hi> done so, she had not been overcome, for this is meant
towards ye, whom the Lord by his righteous Judgments hath
made roome for a measure of his: But this is the council of
the Lord to such as have been so overcome, while the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and conflicts are upon their spirits, through the cause be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mentioned, stand still and see the salvation of God, which
is in the light of his Covenant, which will stretch forth the
hand of his power, as he did to <hi>Peter</hi> when he feared the proud
waves would have prevailed over him; for I can testifie, as
I have received in the eternal council of the Lord, which lyes
as a heavy weight upon my spirit to be discharged, That ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Creature sink down into that that manifest and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,
and so be wrought into it natures, and so all things of
Gods power and authority, ye else shall fall short of that
price which that soul may attain to, which daily sinks down
into it: not as though I my self have altogether attained to
that degree of perfection; but this I can say in the fear and
truth of the Lord, that I am one that presseth hard after it, and
it is the desire of my soul, that others may joyn hands with
me in this work, in that measure of life that the Father hath
bestowed in us: So cease thy mourning, thou weeping babe,
that mourns in secret for manifestations from thy beloved, as
thou hast had in dayes past; for I can testifie unto thee by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
whosoever thou art in that state, that he is bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thee nearer him, for that was but milk which he fed thee
with whilst thou was weak, but he will feed thee with the
Word from whence that milk proceedeth, if thou be willing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:31761:2"/>
and obedient to live at home with <hi>Jacob,</hi> which is daily to
retire thy mind; though the gadding, hunting <hi>Esau</hi> perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes
thee for it, thou shalt receive the blessing in which all
happiness and felicity doth consist for evermore. For as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sau</hi>
went to hunt abroad, when the blessing was to be received
at home, so I testifie unto thee from the Lord, whomsoever
thou art, that art convinced that the Word is in thy heart,
and yet goes a gadding and hunting after the manifestation
that proceeds from the word in others vessels, I tell thee,
in Gods eternal truth, whomsoever thou art, that thou
maist receive them in a wrong ground, and that nature that
is contrary to the Word of the Kingdome, may be alive
in thee, and thou in it, in which thou canst not enter the
Kingdome: Therefore come down, come down to the Word
of his patience, which is nigh in your hearts, which if you
do, he will keep you in the hour of temptation, which shall
come to try all upon what foundation they are built; for
saith Christ, which is the word of God, <hi>My sheep hear
my voice, and they follow me:</hi> and I the Word will give
them eternal life, and none can <hi>pull them out of his hand,</hi>
which is that living Word, from whence this testimony of
mine proceedeth. Oh how my bowels yernes in that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Word! yea, that ye may not fall short, but be crowned
with Immortality and glory; for oh the glorious day of the
Lord God hasteth to be revealed to those that are kept faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in his Word.</p>
            <closer>
               <signed>Given forth by one whose heart the Lord hath enlarged
in his own life towards ye, that I can speak it in
the integrity of my soul, that if I could breath forth
the measure of life that I have received, to do the
least babes good, I should freely do it, who am called
by the name of
S. J.</signed>
