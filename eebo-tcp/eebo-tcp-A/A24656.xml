            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Account of Some Particulars IN THE TRYAL OF Mr. Ed. Fitz Harris: In Weſtminſter-Hall, <date>June 9. 1681.</date> Where he was Found Guilty of HIGH-TREASON.</head>
            <head type="sub">Together with a BrIef RELATION of the TRYAL of Oliver Plunket The Popiſh <hi>Primate</hi> of <hi>IRELAND,</hi> at the ſame Place, the day before: who was likewiſe found Guilty of <hi>HIGH-TREASON.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THIS morning about Nine a Clock the Court ſate, there being the four Judges of His Majeſties Court of <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> preſent, and the Jury being impanell'd and Sworn, Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> was ſoon after brought thither, and his Wife being in the Court, deſired the favour to ſtand nigh her Husband, which was granted her: Then an Indictment of High-Treaſon was read againſt Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> for conſpiring the Death of the King, and the over-throw of the Government, and ſtirring up His Majeſties Subjects to Sedition and Rebellion, by contriving and publiſhing a Dangerous and Treaſonable Libel.</p>
            <p>Then the Witneſſes were called, and Mr. <hi>Edmund Everard</hi> being firſt, gave a large and full Account of this Treaſonable Deſign of Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> with ſeveral very conſiderable Circumſtances, to demonſtrate the reality of his Teſtimony.</p>
            <p>Then Mr. <hi>John Smith,</hi> one of the Diſcoverers of the late horrid <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> was called, who confirmed what Mr. <hi>Everard</hi> had ſaid, giving an Account how by Mr. <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard</hi>'s means he was placed in a convenient Room, where he and Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> heard Mr <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> endeavour to perſwade Mr. <hi>Everard</hi> to engage in ſeveral Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Practices, and that a notorious Libel ſhould be diſperſed abroad, to raiſe a diſturbance between the King and his People.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> was next called, and ſpake ſeveral things to the ſame purpoſe; and it did appear, That this Libel was to be diſpoſed among His Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects, that it might ſeem they intended to diſturb the Government, and that theſe Papers being ſent to them, ſoon after other Perſons ſhould have followed to have ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, and before they had had time to diſcover them to a Magiſtrate, ſhould have ſeized thoſe Libels about them; and that theſe Gentlemen were to have been proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as Authors or Diſperſers of Treaſonable Libels againſt His Majeſty and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Philip Lloyd</hi> was likewiſe called into Court, and two or three other.</p>
            <p>The Kings Witneſſes having concluded their Evidence, and the Libel being read o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in Court, and compared, and ſeveral Paragraphs of a very high and Treaſonable nature, which, were inſerted into the Indictment, being remarkt; The Court were plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to tell Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> That he had now Liberty to make the beſt Defence for himſelf, he could, and that he might have ſuch Witneſſes called as he deſired; wh<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

thereupon nominated firſt Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> who accordingly appeared, and declared what he had to ſay, but not upon Oath no more than the reſt, ſince it is not allowable in behalf the Priſoner; Then Madam <hi>Wall,</hi> who belongs to the Dutcheſs of <hi>Portſmouth</hi> was called, and Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> asked her ſeveral queſtions about Two Hundred pound which he had received by Order from the Dutcheſs, Mr<gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s. <hi>Wall</hi> ſaid, That if the Court deſired it, the Dutcheſs her ſelf would come thither, who thereupon Ordered, That ſhe ſhould appear, which ſhe did accordingly, in a very ſhort time; and it was alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the money given, was only upon the Account of Charity, and toward the relief of his Neceſſities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his Father having ſuffered very much in his Eſtate in the late Wars.</p>
            <p>Collonel <hi>Manſell</hi> Mr. Sherriff <hi>Bethel,</hi> Mr. Sherriff <hi>Corniſh,</hi> and divers others were likewiſe called into Court, and Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> asked them ſeveral Queſtions.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Howard</hi> of <hi>Eſcrick,</hi> was then called into Court, who ſpoke very large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſeveral things, and gave an Account that Mr. <hi>Fitz Harris</hi> had been with him divers times, and perſwaded him to come to Court, and that particularly Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> came to him the day before the late Lord Viſcount <hi>Stafford</hi> received his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and perſwaded him to give in his Opinion <hi>That the Lord</hi> Stafford <hi>was Not Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> which he told him would be very acceptable; But the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> was pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to anſwer him to this purpoſe; <hi>That if the neareſt Friend or Relation he had were ſo Guilty of</hi> High-Treaſon <hi>as he judged the Lord</hi> Stafford <hi>to be, no man ſhould be more forward to bring him to Juſtice than himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> added ſome other things in his own Defence, which being ended, Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> General firſt, and then Sir <hi>George Jeffries</hi> ſummed up the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ſhewing the notoriouſneſs of the Treaſon whereof he was Guilty, and what a World of Miſeries theſe Practices might produce to the Nation, &amp;c. After which the Judges perticularly gave their ſence of the Heinouſneſs of the Crime; and that the Jury ſhould take ſpecial Care, that the Blood of the King and Kingdom ſhould not fall upon their Heads.</p>
            <p>The Foreman of the Jury, then deſired; as we hear, to be informed by the Court whether they could ſafely give their Verdict in the Caſe of Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> ſince the late Houſe of Commons at <hi>Oxford,</hi> had paſſed a Vote, that he ought not to be Tryed, but before the Houſe of Peers in Parliament? The Court told them, they ought to take no Notice thereof, and that now they were by Oath obliged to determine the buſineſs before them, and that they ſhould have made this Objection before; And one of the Judges was pleaſed to ſay, That a Vote of the Commons had no more Obligation upon them then a Letter from the King, which they were not bound to take any notice of.</p>
            <p>The Jury then Withdrew, and after about half an hours Conſultation among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they returned into Court, and being demanded whether they were agreed in their Verdict, they Anſwered, <hi>Yes</hi>; and that the Priſoner was Guilty of High-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>The Court then broke up, and Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> accompanied with his Wife, who was Extreamly concerned at her hard Fate, was Guarded back to the <hi>Tower</hi> by Water, and, it is thought, will in a day or two receive his Sentence at the ſame place: together with <hi>Oliver Pluncket</hi> the Popiſh Lord Primate of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who was Tryed there the day before for High Treaſon, in Conſpiring the Death of the King, Introducing Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and delivering the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> to the <hi>French</hi> King, to which purpoſe he had received and paid ſeveral ſums of Money, and was to raiſe many Thouſands of <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who were to joyn with the <hi>French</hi> King, upon his Landing, and that an Haven was appointed to that purpoſe; There were five or ſix Witneſſes againſt him, who proved the Treaſon poſitively upon him, and though he had all the liberty he could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to make his Defence, yet he had very little to ſay for himſelf, only he pretended that thoſe Witneſſes which he deſigned ſhoudl appear on his behalf were in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this Allegation was thought altogether Frivolous, by reaſon he has had ſo long time ſince he has been in <hi>Newgate</hi> to ſend for them over; ſo that upon the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, after a very ſhort Conſultation, the Jury brought him in Guilty of <hi>High Treaſon.</hi>
