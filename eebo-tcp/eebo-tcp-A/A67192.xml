            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>Poets like Cudgel'd Bullys, never do</l>
            <l>At first, or second blow, submit to you;</l>
            <l>But will provoke you still, and ne're have done,</l>
            <l>Till you are weary first, with laying on:</l>
            <l>The late so bafled Scribler of this day,</l>
            <l>Though he stands trembling, bids me boldly say,</l>
            <l>What we, before most Playes are us'd to do,</l>
            <l>For Poets out of fear, first draw on you;</l>
            <l>In a fierce Prologue, the still Pit defie,</l>
            <l>And e're you speak, like <hi>Castril,</hi> give the lye;</l>
            <l>But though our <hi>Bayses</hi> Batles oft I've fought,</l>
            <l>And with bruis'd knuckles, their dear Conquests bought;</l>
            <l>Nay, never yet fear'd Odds upon the Stage,</l>
            <l>In Prologue dare not Hector with the Age,</l>
            <l>But wou'd take Quarter from your saving hands,</l>
            <l>Though <hi>Bayse</hi> within all yielding Countermands,</l>
            <l>Says you Confed'rate Wits no Quarter give,</l>
            <l>Ther'fore his Play shan't ask your leave to live:</l>
            <l>Well, let the vain rash Fop, by buffing so,</l>
            <l>Think to obtain the better terms of you;</l>
            <l>But we the Actors humbly will submit,</l>
            <l>Now, and at any time, to a full Pit;</l>
            <l>Nay, often we anticipate your rage,</l>
            <l>And murder Poets for you, on our Stage:</l>
            <l>We set no Guards upon our Tyring-Room,</l>
            <l>But when with flying Colours, there you come,</l>
            <l>We patiently you see, give up to you,</l>

                  <p>Your late journey into <hi>France</hi> has made it the more credible, and your being here a fortnight before you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in publick, looks as if you apprehended the shame, which I wonder you do not: Well I have been hired by young Gallants to bely'em t'other way; but you are the first wou'd be thought a Man unfit for Women.</p>

                  <p>Doctor, there are Quacks in love, as well as Physick, who get but the fewer and worse Patients, for their boasting; a good name is seldom got by giving it ones self, and Women no more than honour are compass'd by bragging: Come, come Doctor, the wisest Lawyer never discovers the merits of his cause till the tryal; the wealthiest Man conceals his riches, and the cunning Gamster his play; Shy Husbands and Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers like old Rooks are not to be cheated, but by a new un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practis'd trick; false friendship will pass now no more than false dice upon'em, no, not in the City.</p>

                  <p>Pshaw, a Mask makes People but the more inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive, and is as ridiculous a disguise, as a stage-beard; her shape, stature, habit will be known: and if we shou'd meet with <hi>Horner,</hi> he wou'd be sure to take acquaintance with us, must wish her joy, kiss her, talk to her, leer upon her, and the Devil and all; no I'll not use her to a Mask, 'tis dangerous; for Masks have made more Cuckolds, than the best faces that ever were known.</p>

            <byline>spoken by Mr. Hart:</byline>
            <l>Now you the Vigorous, who dayly here</l>
            <l>O're Vizard Mask, in publick domineer,</l>
            <l>And what you'd doe to her if in Place where;</l>
            <l>Nay have the confidence, to cry come out,</l>
            <l>Yet when she says lead on, you are not stout;</l>
            <l>But to your well-drest Brother straight turn round</l>
            <l>And cry, Pox on her <hi>Ned,</hi> she can't be sound:</l>
            <l>Then slink away, a fresh one to ingage,</l>
            <l>With so much seeming heat and loving Rage,</l>
            <l>You'd frighten listning Actress on the Stage:</l>
            <l>Till she at last has seen you huffing come,</l>
            <l>And talk of keeping in the Tyreing-Room,</l>
            <l>Yet cannot be provok'd to lead her home:</l>
            <l>Next you <hi>Fallstaffs</hi> of fifty, who beset</l>
            <l>Your Buckram Maidenheads, which your friends get;</l>
            <l>And whilst to them, you of Atchievements boast,</l>
            <l>They share the booty, and laugh at your cost,</l>
            <l>In fine, you Essens't Boyes, both Old and Young,</l>
            <l>Who wou'd be thought so eager, brisk, and strong,</l>
            <l>Yet do the Ladies, not their Husbands, wrong:</l>
            <l>Whose Purses for your manhood make excuse,</l>
            <l>And keep your Flanders Mares for shew, not use;</l>
            <l>Encourag'd by our Womans Man to day,</l>
            <l>A <hi>Horners</hi> part may vainly think to Play;</l>
            <l>And may Intreagues so bashfully disown</l>
            <l>That they may doubted be by few or none,</l>
            <l>May kiss the Cards at Picquet, Hombre, —Lu,</l>
            <l>And so be thought to kiss the Lady too;</l>
            <l>But Gallants, have a care faith, what you do.</l>
            <l>The World, which to no man his due will give,</l>
            <l>You by experience know you can deceive,</l>
            <l>And men may still believe you Vigorous,</l>
            <l>But then we Women, —there's no cous'ning us.</l>
