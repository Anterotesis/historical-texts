            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>IN</hi> offering the following pages to the public, I feel myself necessitated to apologize for the errors which I am fearful will be evident to the severe eye of criticism.</p>
            <p>The thought of writing a Dramatic Piece was hastily conceived, and as hastily executed; it being not more than two months, from the first starting of the idea, to the time of its being performed.</p>
            <p>I feel myself extremely happy, in having an opportunity, thus publicly to acknowledge my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to Mr. Reinagle, for the attention he manifested, and the taste and genius he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played in the composition of the music. I must also return my thanks to the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, who so readily accepted, and so ably supported their several characters: Since it was chiefly owing to their exertions, that the Play was received with such unbounded marks of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.</p>
            <p>Since the first performance, I have made some alterations; and flatter myself those alterations have improved it: But of that, as well as of its merits in general, I am content to abide the decision of a candid and indulgent Public.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="ii" facs="unknown:027655_0005_0FD56971B0167490"/>Some part of the plot is taken from the Story of the Captive, related by Cervantes, in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imitable Romance of Don Quixote, the rest is entirely the offspring of fancy.</p>
            <p>I am fully sensible of the many disadvantges under which I consequently labour from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined education; nor do I expect my style will be thought equal in elegance or energy, to the productions of those who, fortunately, from their sex, or situation in life, have been instructed in the Classics, and have reaped both pleasure and improvement by studying the Ancients in their original purity.</p>
            <p>My chief aim has been, to offer to the Public a Dramatic Entertainment, which, while it might excite a smile, or call forth the tear of sensibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, might contain no one sentiment, in the least prejudicial, to the moral or political principles of the government under which I live. On the contrary, it has been my endeavour, to place the social virtues in the fairest point of view, and hold up, to merited contempt and ridicule, their opposite vices. If, in this attempt, I have been the least successful, I shall reap the reward to which I aspire, in the smiles and approbation of a Liberal Public.</p>

            <head>PROLOGUE, To the New Comedy of SLAVES IN ALGIERS.</head>
            <byline>Written and Spoken by Mr. FENNELL.</byline>
            <lg>
               <l>WHEN aged Priam, to Achilles' tent</l>
               <l>To beg the captive corse of Hector went,</l>
               <l>The silent suppliant spoke the father's fears,</l>
               <l>His sighs his eloquence—his prayers his tears.</l>
               <l>The noble conqueror by the sight was won,</l>
               <l>And to the weeping sire restor'd the son.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>No great Achilles holds <hi>your</hi> sons in chains,</l>
               <l>No heart alive to friends' or father's pains,</l>
               <l>No generous conqueror who is proud to shew,</l>
               <l>That valour vanquish'd is no more his foe;—</l>
               <l>But one, whose idol, is his pilfer'd gold,</l>
               <l>Got, or by piracy, or subjects sold.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Him</hi> no fond father's prayers nor tears can melt,</l>
               <l>Untaught to feel for, what he never felt.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>What then behoves it, they who help'd to gain,</l>
               <l>A nation's freedom, feel the galling chain?</l>
               <l>They, who a more than ten year's war withstood,</l>
               <l>And stamp'd their country's honour with their blood?</l>
               <l>Or, shall the noble Eagle see her brood,</l>
               <l>Beneath the pirate kite's fell claw subdu'd?</l>
               <l>View her dear sons of liberty enslaved,</l>
               <l>Nor let them share the blessings which they sav'd?</l>
               <l>—It must not be—each heart, each soul must rise,</l>
               <l>Each ear must listen to their distant cries;</l>
               <l>Each hand must give, and the quick sail unfurl'd,</l>
               <l>Must bear their ransom to the distant world.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="unknown:027655_0007_0FD56976472D43D8"/>Nor <hi>here</hi> alone, Columbia's sons be free,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Where'er</hi> they breath there must be liberty.</l>
               <l>—There <hi>must!</hi> there <hi>is,</hi> for he who form'd the whole,</l>
               <l>Entwin'd blest freedom with th' immortal <hi>soul.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Eternal twins, whose mutual efforts fan,</l>
               <l>That heavenly flame that gilds the life of man,</l>
               <l>Whose light, 'midst manacles and dungeons drear,</l>
               <l>The sons of honour, must forever cheer.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>What tyrant then the virtuous heart can bind?</l>
               <l>'Tis vices only can enslave the mind.</l>
               <l>Who barters country, honour, faith, to save</l>
               <l>His life, tho' free in person, is a slave.</l>
               <l>While he, enchain'd, imprison'd tho' he be,</l>
               <l>Who lifts his arm for liberty, is free.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>To-night, our author boldly dares to chuse,</l>
               <l>This glorious subject for her humble muse;</l>
               <l>Tho' tyrants check the genius which they fear,</l>
               <l>She dreads no check, nor persecution <hi>here</hi>;</l>
               <l>Where safe asylums every virtue guard,</l>
               <l>And every talent meets its just reward.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Some say—the Comic muse, with watchful eye,</l>
               <l>Should catch the reigning <hi>vices</hi> as they fly,</l>
               <l>Our author boldly has revers'd that plan,</l>
               <l>The reigning <hi>virtues</hi> she has dar'd to scan,</l>
               <l>And tho' a woman, plead the Rights of Man.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus she, with anxious hope her fate abides,</l>
               <l>And to your care, the tender plant confides,</l>
               <l>Convinc'd you'll cherish, what to freedom's true;</l>
               <l>She trusts its life, to candour and to you.</l>

                     <p>WELL, it's all vastly pretty, the gardens, the house and these fine cloaths, I like them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, but I don't like to be confined.</p>

                     <p>O, a great many things—In the first place, I wish for liberty. Why do you talk of my being a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite; is the poor bird that is confined in a cage (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a favourite with its enslaver) consoled for the loss of freedom. No! tho' its prison is of golden wire, its food delicious, and it is overwhelm'd with caresses, its little heart still pants for liberty: gladly
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:027655_0010_0FD569798BA260D8"/>
would it seek the fields of air, and even perched up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a naked bough, exulting, carrol forth its song, nor once regret the splendid house of bondage.</p>

                     <p>No—he is old and ugly, then he wears such tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menduous whiskers; and when he makes love, he looks so grave and stately, that I declare, if it was not for fear of his huge scymetar, I shou'd burst out a laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his face.</p>

                     <speaker>FETNAH.</speaker>
                     <p>I don't care how I provoke him, if I can but make him keep his distance. You know I was brought here only a few days since—well, yesterday, as I was amusing myself, looking at the fine things I saw every where about me, who should bolt into the room, but that great, ugly thing Mustapha. What do you want, said I?—Most beautiful Fetnah, said he, bowing till the tip of his long, hooked nose almost ouched the toe of his slipper—most beautiful Fetnah, our power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and gracious master, Muley Moloc, sends me, the humblest of his slaves, to tell you, he will condescend to sup in your apartment to night, and commands you to receive the high honour with proper humility.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>FETNAH.</speaker>
                     <p>Lord, I was so frightened, and so provoked, I hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know what I said, but finding the horrid looking creature didn't move, at last I told him, that if the Dey was determined to come, I supposed he must, for I could not hinder him.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>SELIMA.</speaker>
                     <p>And did he come?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>FETNAH.</speaker>
                     <p>No—but he made me go to him, and when I went trembling into the room, he twisted his whiskers and knit his great beetle brows. Fetnah said, he you abuse my goodness, I have condescended to request you to love me. And then he gave me such a fierce look, as if he would say, and if you don't love me, I'll cut your head off.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>SELIMA.</speaker>
                     <p>I dare say you were finely frightened.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>FETNAH.</speaker>
                     <p>Frightened! I was provoked beyond all patience, and thinking he would certainly kill me one day or other, I thought I might as well speak my mind, and be dispatched out of the way at once.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>SELIMA.</speaker>

slave; you took me from an humble state, placed me in this fine palace, and gave me these rich cloaths; you bought my person of my parents, who loved gold bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than they did their child; but my affections you could not buy. I can't love you.—How! cried he, starting from his seat: how, can't love me?—and he laid his hand upon his scymetar.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>SELIMA.</speaker>
                     <p>Oh dear! Fetnah.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>FETNAH.</speaker>
                     <p>When I saw the scymetar half drawn, I caught hold of his arm.—Oh! good my lord, said I, pray do not kill a poor little girl like me, send me home again, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow your favour on some other, who may think splendor a compensation for the loss of liberty.—Take her away, said he, she is beneath my anger</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>SELIMA.</speaker>
                     <p>But, how is it Fetnah, that you have covceived such an aversion to the manners of a country where you were born.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>FETNAH.</speaker>
                     <p>You are mistaken.—I was not born in Algiers, I drew my first breath in England; my father, Ben Has<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>san, as he is now called, was a Jew. I can scarcely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member our arrival here, and have been educated in the Moorish religion, tho' I always had a natural an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy to their manners,</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>FETNAH.</speaker>
                     <p>No; she has no objection to any of their customs, except that of their having a great many wives at

a time. But some few months since, my father, (who sends out many corsairs,) brought home a female cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, to whom I became greatly attached; it was she, who nourished in my mind the love of liberty, and taught me, woman was never formed to be the abject slave of man. Nature made us equal with them, and gave us the power to render ourselves superior.</p>

                  <sp>

                     <p>She is still at my father's, waiting the arrival of her ransom, for she is a woman of fortune. And tho' I can no longer listen to her instructions, her precepts are engraven on my heart, I feel that I was born free, and while I have life, I will struggle to remain so.</p>

Now, if by means of these cloaths, I can get out of the palace, I'll seek the charming young Christian I saw this morning, we'll get my dear instructress from my fathers, and fly together, from this land of capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity to the regions of Peace and Liberty.</p>

This is the summum-bonum of all good:—If they are kind, this, this, makes them appear angels and goddesses:—If they are saucy, why then, here, here, in this we'll drown the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the bewitching, froward, little devils —in all kind of difficulties and vexations, nothing helps the invention, or cheers the courage, like a drop from the jorum.</p>

                           <l>WHEN I was a poor, little innocent boy,</l>

                           <l>At Susan and Marian I cast a sheep's eye,</l>

whom we must accost with respect, and convey hence in safety—she is a woman of family and fortune, and is highly pleased with my person and abillities; let us therefore, search every cranny of the house till we find her; she may not recollect me directly, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver mind, we will carry her away first, and assure her of her safety afterwards; go search the rooms in that wing, I will myself, investigate the apartments on this side.

Well I have made these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades of mine, believe I am a favoured lover, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit of a kind mistress, that's something for them to talk of; and I believe many a fine gentleman is talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of for love affairs, that has as little foundation; and so one is but talked of, as a brave or gallant man, what signifies whether there is any foundation for it or no;—and yet, hang it, who knows but I may prove it a reality, if I release this lady from captivity, she may cast an eye of affection,—may—why I dare say she will.—I am but poor Sebastian, the barber of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dova's son, 'tis true; but I am well made, very well made; my leg is not amiss,—then I can make a graceful bow; and as to polite compliments, let me but find her, and I'll shew them what it is to have a pretty person, a graceful air<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a smooth tongue.— But I must search this apartment.

                     <p>By the Christian law, no man should be a slave; it is a word so abject, that, but to speak it dyes the cheek with crimson.

                  <l>Sir I am here—but I'm in such a flurry,</l>
                  <l>Do let me stop a moment! just for breath,
<stage>Enter.</stage>
                  </l>
                  <l>Bless me! I'm almost terrify'd to death.</l>
                  <l>Yet sure, I had no real cause for fear,</l>
                  <l>Since none but liberal—generous friends are here.</l>
                  <l>Say—will you kindly overlook my errors?</l>
                  <l>You smile.—Then to the winds I give my terrors.</l>
                  <l>Well, Ladies tell me—how d'ye like my play?</l>
                  <l>"The creature has some sense," methinks you say;</l>
                  <l>"She says that we should have supreme dominion,</l>
                  <l>"And in good truth, we're all of her opinion.</l>
                  <l>"Women were born for universal sway,</l>
                  <l>"Men to adore, be silent, and obey."</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>True, Ladies—bounteous nature made us fair,</l>
                  <l>To strew sweet roses round the bed of care.</l>
                  <l>A parent's heart, of sorrow to beguile,</l>
                  <l>Cheer an afflicted husband by a smile.</l>
                  <l>To bind the truant, that's inclined to roam,</l>
                  <l>Good humour makes a paradise at home.</l>
                  <l>To raise the fall'n—to pity and forgive,</l>
                  <l>This is our noblest, best prerogative.</l>
                  <l>By these, pursuing nature's gentle plan,</l>
                  <l>We hold in silken chains—the lordly tyrant man.</l>

                  <l>But pray, forgive this flippancy—indeed,</l>
                  <l>Of all your clemency I stand in need.</l>
                  <l>To own the truth, the scenes this night display'd,</l>
                  <l>Are only fictions—drawn by fancy's aid.</l>
                  <l>'Tis what I wish—But we have cause to fear,</l>
                  <l>No ray of comfort, the sad bosoms cheer,</l>
                  <l>Of many a Christian, shut from light and day,</l>
                  <l>In bondage, languishing their lives away.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Say!—You who feel humanity's soft glow,</l>
                  <l>What rapt'rous joy must the poor captive know;</l>
                  <l>Who, free'd from slavery's ignominious chain,</l>
                  <l>Views his dear native land, and friends again?</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>If there's a sense, more exquisitely fine,</l>
                  <l>A joy more elevated, more divine;</l>
                  <l>'Tis felt by those, whose liberal minds conceiv'd,</l>
                  <l>The generous plan, by which he was reliev'd.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>When first this glorious universe began,</l>
                  <l>And heaven to punish disobedient man;</l>
                  <l>Sent to attend him, through life's dreary shade,</l>
                  <l>Affliction—poor dejected, weeping maid.</l>
                  <l>Then came Benevolence, by all rever'd,</l>
                  <l>He dry'd the mourner's tears, her heart he cheer'd;</l>
                  <l>He woo'd her to his breast—made her his own,</l>
                  <l>And Gratitude appear'd, their first-born son.</l>
                  <l>Since when, the father and the son has join'd,</l>
                  <l>To shed their influence o'er the human mind:</l>
                  <l>And in the heart, where either deign to rest,</l>
                  <l>Rise transports, difficult to be express'd.</l>
                  <l>Such, as within your generous bosoms glow,</l>
                  <l>Who feel return'd, the blessings you bestow.</l>
                  <l>Oh! ever may you taste, those joys divine,</l>
