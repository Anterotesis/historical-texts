            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THat <hi>Preparation for Chriſt</hi> is neceſſary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Soul can be United to him by Faith, is an undoubted Truth. <hi>He came not to call the Righteous, but Sinners to Repentance.</hi> Men muſt be convinced of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sinners, or they will not be in bitterneſs for it: Sin muſt be bitter to them, or they will not forſake it. As long as they love their ſins, it is impoſſible, that they ſhould believe on Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.44. Nor will they come to Chriſt for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and Life, except they have an <hi>humbling ſenſe</hi> of their own unrighteouſneſs, <hi>Ro.</hi> 10.3. Theſe are Truths which cannot be denied. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there is any <hi>praeparatory Work,</hi> which is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving before Faith, has been controverted among Divines.

It has been an Error (and a <hi>Tyranical</hi> one) in ſome Preachers, that they have made their own particular experiences a Standard for all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

            <head>THE Preface.</head>
            <p>THE Work of <hi>Regeneration</hi> being of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity unto Salvation, it greatly concerns Miniſters eſpecially, in all ways poſſible to promote the ſame; and in particular, that they guide Souls aright who are under a work of <hi>Preparation:</hi> ſome there be that do deny any neceſſity of the <hi>Preparatory</hi> work of the Spirit of God, in order to a cloſing with Chriſt, this is a very dark Cloud, both as it is an evidence that ſuch men have not the experience of that work in their own Souls; and as it is a ſign that ſuch men are utterly unskilful in guiding others that are under this work: if this <hi>Opinion</hi> ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail in the Land, it would give a deadly wound to Religion, it would expoſe men to think themſelves Converted when they are not: if men do underſtand that there is a work of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation</hi> before Faith, then if they get ſome common affections, love, ſorrow, delight, yea, and a common faith too, they will ſay theſe are not of the right kind; for men muſt ſee the plague of their own hearts, their hepleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001716_0011_0FB74C16B5D0BFA8"/>and that they are like <hi>Clay in the hand of the Potter,</hi> before they come to Chriſt, and ſo will be afraid, and be ſearching of themſelves; but if they do not know any neceſſity of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, they will take the firſt appearances of Holineſs for Holineſs; and if they find religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous affections in themſelves, they will grow confident that God has wrought a good work in them. It would likewiſe expoſe them to boulſter up others in a falſe confidence: a man that knows there muſt be a work of preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will be careful how he encourages others that they are in Chriſt, he will enquire how God has made way for their receiving of Chriſt; but another that is a ſtranger to it, will be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to take all for gold that gliſters, and if he ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> men religiouſly diſpoſed, will be ſpeaking peace to them; he will be like the falſe <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> ſaying, <hi>peace, peace, when there is no peace:</hi> ſo men will be hardned, it is a diſmal thing to give men ſleepy notions; and make them ſleep the ſleep of death.</p>
            <p>The truth of this Opinion is much to be ſuſpected from what has been left on Record to the contrary, by <hi>Hilderſham, Perkins, Dod, Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>But there are other Scriptures which hold forth, that there muſt be PREPARATION for Chriſt before our Cloſing with him: it does appear by INSTANCES recorded in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: One is of <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 9.4, 5. he was ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifyed, in way of preparation to his receiving of Chriſt, and about the ſame time was led in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the underſtanding of his own helpleſsneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9. Another is of the <hi>Jaylor,</hi> Acts 16.29, 30, 31. he was greatly ſcared, leaſt he ſhould fall ſhort of Salvation; and ſince we have ſuch circumſtances, and none to the contrary, we may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> judge that this is Gods method in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Sinners.</p>
            <p>It alſo appears from ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> as are held forth in the Scriptures: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſome Sinners are <hi>near the Kingdom of God,</hi> and others are far from it: <hi>Mark</hi> 12.34. this ſhews that
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001716_0013_0FB74C1CC0DA1038"/>ſome men are in a more prepared way, and more hopeful to receive it than others: So that doctrine that ſome are not in a preſent incapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to come to Chriſt, becauſe under the <hi>power of a earnal deſign:</hi> Joh. 5.44. this ſhews that men muſt be broken off from their carnal deſigns before they come to Chriſt: ſo the doctrine of the <hi>difficulty of getting into a ſtate of Salvation. Mat.</hi> 7.13. <hi>Luke</hi> 13.24. this ſhews that there be many difficulties in the way of Converſion; and that by ſtriving, they may get into a nearer preparedneſs for faith.</p>
            <p>It alſo appears by that PROPHESY of our Saviour, where it is foretold that God will firſt <hi>prepars</hi> men, and then bring them to <hi>Christ,</hi> Joh. 16.8. here it is foretold what method the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit will take with men; he will not reveal the <hi>Righteouſneſs of Christ</hi> to men in the firſt place; but in order to this, he <hi>convinces them of ſin,</hi> makes them ſee their danger and miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: firſt he ſearches their wound, and then applies the remedy: It appears alſo, by the <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular application of the Call of the Goſpel to thoſe that are prepared:</hi> Sometimes the <hi>Call</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded <hi>generally</hi> to all, but at other times <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> propounded <hi>particularly</hi> to ſuch as are <hi>in diſtreſs by reaſon of their ſins;</hi> that ſee themſelves miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and undone. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. the Call is applied particularly to theſe, as being in the next capacity to give entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto it: intimating the condition that men muſt be in before they do receive it.</p>

               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:001716_0014_0FB74C1FA9020C00"/>
EXPERIENCE alſo gives conſiderable light in this matter: we learn by <hi>experience,</hi> that mens hearts are generally ſet for carnal things before they are terrified, and for their own Righteouſneſs before they ſee their own hearts. Generally ſuch men as have not had the <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of God</hi> in them, don't much mind <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Things;</hi> if they be not rude and vicious, yet they are worldly, vain and proud. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. And ſuch convinced ſinners as have not been led into the <hi>understanding of their hearts,</hi> are ſet to build up a righteouſneſs of their own, they are taking incouragement from their frames, with a neglect of Chriſt. <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience</hi> alſo ſhews that many men highly reputed of for Religion, have had a work of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Many men that have a ſpecial inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in the hearts of others, can give a fair account how they have been prepared for Chriſt: and many Profeſſors that have not had ſuch experience have not proved well. Several that have had ſome lighter toucher of Conviction, though they have made a blaze <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001716_0015_0FB74C21291FB1D8"/>affections, enlargements and encouragements; it was all common work, and they had no ſpark of grace in them; their Religion was but the ſruit of nature improved. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9. Yea, this is exceeding <hi>agreeable to REASON;</hi> the light of Nature cannot give a demonſtration of it: for it is a voluntary diſpenſation; there is no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity in nature of any preparation before the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of GRACE. Chriſt changed the Water into Wine, and raiſed the Dead to Life, without any previous preparation; ſo he can do in this caſe. The work of preparation does not make the work of the new Creation the eaſier; for after men have a work of preparation, ſin reigns in them as much as before; preparation does not at all deſtroy the principle; &amp; men when prepared, can do nothing to help God in plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace in them: and men that are not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, can do nothing to hinder God in implan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Grace: but yet it is very agreeable to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that the Spirit do work a work of <hi>prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> before it does infuſe Grace: for it is the duty of <hi>Ministers</hi> to preach ſuch things to Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as are proper to work this preparation; they are bound to preach the <hi>threatnings of the Law,</hi> mans <hi>Inſufficiency,</hi> and <hi>God's Soveraignty:</hi> Yea, the manner of God is to deal with men, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of men. Man is a rational Creature, and therefore God deals with him in a moral way <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Convictions before him. Men would make Enemies ſubmit, before they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them; ſo does God. Beſides, it is the <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001716_0016_0FB74C229BC7ADD8"/>of the Sinner</hi> to do thoſe things wherein pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration does conſiſt; it is their duty to <hi>ſeek to God,</hi> to <hi>reform,</hi> and to <hi>make an abſolute reſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of themſelves to God. No wonder then if God holds them to it; Yea further, there is an <hi>abſolute neceſſity in nature,</hi> that men be <hi>prepared</hi> before the <hi>Exerciſe of Faith;</hi> men cannot exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Faith, till the heart be prepared by <hi>a ſinſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> danger,</hi> and the <hi>inſufficiency of other things.</hi> If they don't ſee their danger, they can ſee no occaſion that they have to come to Chriſt: if they don't ſee themſelves liable to Wrath, how can they come to Chriſt to ſave them from Wrath; as long as they imagine that they can help themſelves, they will not come to Chriſt for help: men can't truſt in Chriſt alone, till driven out of themſelves; they cannot come as helpleſs and undone, until they ſee themſelves ſo. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing there is ſuch a work of <hi>preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> foregoing mens <hi>Cloſing with Christ,</hi> it muſt needs be of great conſequence for awakened <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            </head>
            <p>WHEN a Sinner <hi>wounded in Spirit,</hi> does apply himſelf unto a MINISTER of the Goſpel for Counſel, it is profitable, after ſome <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries</hi> concerning the time, means and degree of their Convictions and Terrors to uſe this <hi>method</hi> with him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To confirm and eſtabliſh him more in the apprehenſions of the <hi>dangerouſneſs of a Natural Condition:</hi> ſhewing him that every man that dies in a State of Nature; will certainly be damned, that a State of Dammation is intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, that the continuance of his opportunities for deliverance is very uncertain: for there is danger that if his convictions be not cheriſhed, they may by degrees wear off: many mens ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours are but ſhort liv'd: they harden their
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001716_0021_0FB74C34DA301A00"/>hearts by company, clogging themſelves with worldly buſineſs, and their natural diſpoſition to flatter themſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To incourage him to be <hi>in the uſe of means, in order to his Converſion:</hi> for if they have not hopes of obtaining mercy; either they will not ſeek after it, or they will do it in ſuch a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs &amp; dull way that it will come to nothing: God leads men through the whole work of <hi>preparation</hi> partly by <hi>fear,</hi> and partly by <hi>hope.</hi> If they run into either extream, to have fear without hope, or hope without fear, they are like a Ship that goes beſide the Channel, and is in danger to be broken to pieces; a mixture of fear and hope makes men diligent: they may be incouraged from ſuch conſiderations as theſe: that God has provided a glorious way of Salvation through Chriſt, that all that do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him ſhall be ſaved; that there is an infinite Ocean of mercy in the heart of God; that God has had compaſſion on many greater Sinners than they, that the day of grace is not yet gone: that God is now ſtriving with them by h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That in caſe the Rule does call for <hi>any ſatisfaction to men,</hi> he muſt not delay that, but that muſt be attended as ſoon as there is opportunity; if he can make ſatisfaction without confeſſion, there is no neceſſity of confeſſion; for ſatisfaction anſwers for the wrong that has been done to man.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That he muſt not be ſenſible of that <hi>ſin only,</hi> but <hi>of all other ſins;</hi> every ſin being provoking to God, and deſerving damnation: and particularly that his Impenitency and Unbelief is more dangerous than any former act of ſin: Joh. 3.19. <hi>This is the condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that light is come into the world, and men love darkneſs rather than light</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:001716_0028_0FB74C4E9D5235D8"/>
Sometimes after the man has been in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a while, before he has any great experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his own heart, he has <hi>ſome promiſes come to him with a great deal of refreſhing:</hi> and he hopes God has accepted him; in this caſe the Miniſter may tell him,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it is a <hi>common thing</hi> for God to give <hi>encouragements</hi> unto men, before they are carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thorow the work of Converſion; that a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> God gives them incouragements by his <hi>Word<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> ſo he does many times by his <hi>Spirit:</hi> God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways maintains in the hearts of Sinners that are ſeeking of him, ſome hopes that they may obtain mercy: and ſometimes he gives them very great refreſhing, by ſome ſenſe of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Heaven, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.15. by ſome fuperſicial diſcoveries of Chriſt: <hi>Mat.</hi> 13:20. thereby holding forth ſome promiſes before them, the deſign whereof is to draw them on in a way of ſeeking, and to ſupport them under their temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That God <hi>never gives a Faith of Aſſurance,</hi> before he gives <hi>a Faith of Dependance;</hi> for he never manifeſts his <hi>love till men are in a state</hi> of Favour and Reconciliation, which is by a faith of dependance. When men have comfortable Scriptures come to them, they are apt to take them as tokens of Gods love: but men muſt firſt be brought into Chriſt, by accepting the Offer of the Goſpel before they are fit for ſuch manifeſtations. Gods method is firſt to make the ſoul accept of the Offers of Grace, and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001716_0029_0FB74C5057EDFDE8"/>then to manifeſt his good Eſtate unto him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That if his Comfort be not of the right kind, <hi>it will not continue:</hi> And uſually after ſuch encouragements, mens terrours are wont to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn with as much violence as ever. God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly intermingles <hi>ſmiles</hi> and <hi>frowns,</hi> and if ſuch vain confidences as men took up from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing Scriptures, be but nipped in the bud, they generally quickly wither away; and their fears return as ſtrong as ever.</p>
            <p>WHEN the Sinner that was hoping he was in a good Eſtate, becauſe ſome refreſhing Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures came to him, ſees his miſtake, he is in <hi>danger to be diſcouraged.</hi> In this caſe he may be told,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it is a <hi>common thing</hi> for perſons that are afterwards Converted, <hi>to paſs thorow ſuch Changes;</hi> it is not a peculiar thing to him, but a thing of ordinary experience in ſuch people as God is about to deliver out of a Natural E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. They commonly have ſome lightſome times, and then returns of darkneſs: there was no reaſon to expect that that ſhould laſt very long; ſuch comforts are like <hi>Jonahs Goard,</hi> that riſe in a night, and periſh in a night.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it is a <hi>great mercy that thoſe confiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are taken away from him;</hi> had they continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they would have ruined him; falſe confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is better loſt than kept. His condition is the more hopeful now thoſe confidences are loſt; while he had thoſe confidences he was like a Ship that ſtuck in the Sand, and now he
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001716_0030_0FB74C522233CC60"/>is delivered from them, there is more ground of encouragement.</p>
            <p>AFTER he has had affection and inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>for a while,</hi> he is wont to complain that he <hi>grows more dull,</hi> and he is afraid that his Convictions are about to leave him: In this Caſe he may be told,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That there is no reaſon to expect that his Convictions ſhould always be in the like degree.</hi> Perſons in ſuch a Condition, are ſubject to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny alterations, as it is with a Ship at Sea, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it has a fair Wind, ſometimes it blows more moderately, ſometimes it is becalmed; yea, ſometimes it has Storms and croſs Winds: There be many Changes that paſs over ſuch men. So men in a Journey, have ſometimes good way, ſometimes bad; they meet with Rivers and miery places, where they cannot make ſpeed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That he must be very careful that he do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to quench the motions of the Spirit,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.19. There be many ways whereby men do it, ſometimes by diſcouragement, ſometimes by preſumption and flattery, ſometimes by rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling againſt the light, ſometimes by <hi>Company<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeping.</hi> Men that are much addicted to compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, do commonly loſe theſe Convictions; ſo by crouding themſelves with <hi>Worldly Buſineſs:</hi> tho' diligence be no hindrance, yet combring of themſelves will be a great impediment to the abiding of Convictions.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That it is his best way to improve the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001716_0031_0FB74C5A56133AD8"/>that he has.</hi> Sometimes perſons are wont to argue, that it will be to no purpoſe for them to ſtrive. If they have not greate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Convictions, they ſhall but tire themſelves to no purpoſe; and they conceive it beſt for them to tarry, till they have ſtronger Convictions a but the <hi>Seaman</hi> is wont to hoiſt his Sails, and improve the Wind he has, whether it be leſs or more: if men improve moderate Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they may get forward, and do that which will further their Converſion: and if they do improve leſſer Convictions, that is the way to have more: it is their duty to do it, and in that way God owns them; <hi>to him that hath ſhall be given.</hi> Some that have complained of the ſmallneſs of their Convictions, have within a while changed their note, and complained as much of the greatneſs of them, that they have been ſuch, that they could hardly live under them.</p>
            <p>A Perſon that is under the work of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, is ſubject to many affrightments, and <hi>diſcouraging</hi> TEMPTATIONS, a dreadful ſound is in his Ears: all ſuch perſons have not the ſame temptations, and they have them not in any certain order; but care muſt be taken to give ſuitable ſupport and adviſe to them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>variety</hi> of their temptations. ONE TEMPTATION is, That he is <hi>not</hi> ELECT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ED; but God has Overlooked him, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him to Condemnation; this ſometimes lies upon the heart with great weight: In this Caſe he may be told,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:001716_0032_0FB74C5E12F19818"/>
1. <hi>That thoſe things that make him fear that he is not Elected, are no certain ſigns of it, there be no certain tokens of reprobation upon him.</hi> Thoſe things that he takes to be ſigns are very, uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; the <hi>greatneſs of his ſins</hi> don't argue Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation: Many that have been guilty of great Sins have been Elected. His being of <hi>Elderly years</hi> don't argue it; ſometime God turns ſuch to himſelf, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.5, 6. Gods leaving of him ſtill in a Natural Eſtate, though he has ſought God a long while does not ſhew it; <hi>Iſrael</hi> was a great while travelling from <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Canaan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That it is a ſinful thing for him to draw any concluſions about his Election.</hi> It is a ſecret re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in Gods own Breaſt, and he cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine any thing underſtandingly about it: <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.29. <hi>Secret things belong unto the Lord our God.</hi> When he undertakes to conclude that he is not Elected, he <hi>acts preſumptuouſly:</hi> his concluſion may be falſe for ought he knows; he pretends to know what he is ignorant of.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That Gods striving with him by his Spirit, is an hopeful ſign that he is Elected, for many times is is the fruit of Election.</hi> When the Spirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of Sin, it is in order to his <hi>convincing of Righteouſneſs, Joh.</hi> 16.8. This is the courſe that God is wont to take with thoſe that are Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; frequently he lets Reprobates live in ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but he is wont to terrifie the Elect in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their Converſion; and the more earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the man follows after God, and labours to get into a Converted Condition, the more
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001716_0033_0FB74C5F5C7840F8"/>hopeful it is that God has Elected him; for where God has appointed the end, he has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the means alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Another</hi> TEMPTATION is, That he has committed the UNPARDONABLE SIN; that he has committed the Sin againſt the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost,</hi> that Sin which is <hi>unto Death,</hi> he has carried badly after Illuminations, and it ſinks into him, <hi>that now there is no remedy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Caſe he may be told, That it has been <hi>a frequent thing for men to fear</hi> that they have committed this Sin, who have afterward been Converted; that it is <hi>not the manner</hi> of thoſe that have committed that Sin, to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed and exerciſed with fears about it; but the principal way to help in this Caſe, is to <hi>inform him from the Word of God,</hi> what this Sin is; particularly he may be informed,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it is an <hi>External Sin,</hi> not a Sin that is committed in the heart; men have ſome wicked thoughts after enlightnings, and then fear that they have been guilty of that ſin; but that is an outward ſin, it is a ſin that <hi>other men may ſee,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.16.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it is a <hi>Courſe of Sin,</hi> not any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar act of ſin, which a man breaks off from, and is troubled for, but a way of evil that he does continue impenitently in.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That it is one particular ſort of ſin, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted with great aggravations; namely, <hi>A rejecting of the Profeſſion of the Goſpel:</hi> There be many other grievous ſins, but none of them
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001716_0034_0FB74C60EE4133A8"/>however aggravated, are the <hi>Unpardonable Sin;</hi> it is a rejecting of the Truth of the Goſpel, and renouncing the Profeſſion thereof: they are ſaid to <hi>fail away,</hi> Hebr. 6.6. they are ſaid <hi>to forſake the Aſſemblies of the People of God, Heb.</hi> 10.25. they are ſaid <hi>to tread under feet the Son of God;</hi> and <hi>to deny their Baptiſm, Heb.</hi> 10.29. So that if any perſon among us ſhould turn <hi>Papiſt</hi> or <hi>Heathen,</hi> having a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous ſpirit againſt the Ways of God, and a bloody perſecuting ſpirit towards the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, there might be reaſon to fear that he was guilty of the Unpardonable Sin; but there be no footſteps in the <hi>Scripture</hi> to judge that men that are following after God, and labouring to get into a Converted Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, have committed that Sin, tho' they are guilty of much Unbelief, of many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays and backſlidings, and of very vile tho'ts and riſings of heart; for multitudes of men that have been guilty of ſuch things, have had experience afterwards of the Pardoning Grace of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Another</hi> TEMPTATION is, <hi>that his day of Grace is past;</hi> he had a time when he might have obtained Mercy, but he has let it ſlip, and it is in vain for him to ſtrive: In this Caſe the <hi>Minister</hi> may tell him,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That it is a common device of Satan, when he can't perſwade men that it is too ſoon, then to perſwade them that it is too late.</hi> He is ſet
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001716_0035_0FB74C6BF29280B0"/>to hinder men from uſing of means; and firſt he tells them <hi>that there is no baſte;</hi> and when that temptation will do no longer, then he changes his voice, and tells them that the <hi>ſeaſon is gone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That there is no ſuch Doctrine in the Scripture that any ſort of mens day of grace is paſt, before the day of life is past, except they be guilty of the Unpardonable Sin.</hi> It is taught in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that God will ſtrive with ſome men, only a limited time, and then deſtroy them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. <hi>My Spirit ſhall not always ſtrive with man, yet his days ſhall be an hundred and twenty years.</hi> It is alſo taught, that God does harden ſome Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in order to great miſery, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.10, 11. and ſometimes in order to their <hi>Unchurching, Joh.</hi> 12.40. It is alſo taught, that God may harden ſome particular perſons before Death, and never more ſtrive with them in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable way. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.11. <hi>Let him that in filthy, be filthy ſtill:</hi> But there is no ſuch thing taught, that there is any ſort of men that may be deſcribed, or any particular perſon that may be known unto himſelf or others, whoſe day of grace can be ſaid to be paſt before his death. When men ſay their day is paſt, they only fear, they do not know it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That ſuch Scriptures as ſeem to evidence th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> their day is past, do not determine any ſuch thing</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.1. <hi>that he that being often reproved, hardneth his neck, ſhall ſuddenly be
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001716_0036_0FB74C6DAAE0F1A8"/>deſtroyed.</hi> But it is evident, that God waits longer upon ſome perſons than upon others: Some Threatnings are <hi>univerſal,</hi> and ſome are <hi>indefinite:</hi> ſhewing what God does many times do; ſo it is ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.28. <hi>If any man draw back, my ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him;</hi> but the Backſliding here ſpoken of ſeems to be the <hi>Unpardonable Sin;</hi> he had been ſpeaking of that, <hi>ver.</hi> 26. and ſeems here to have refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the ſame ſin; for in other caſes God does ſpeak incouragingly in his Word unto <hi>Backſliders,</hi> Jer. 3.22. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.4.</p>
            <p>Beſides the Temptations mentioned, there is ANOTHER SORT of Temptations that are very exerciſing to him, his Conſcience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guilty, he is much ſubject to frights.</p>
            <p n="1">1. One Temptation is, That he ſhall be left to <hi>ſome great and dreadful ſins.</hi> In this Caſe he may be told by the Miniſter,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That one ſpecial reaſon of theſe fears is that he <hi>ſees more of the badneſs of his heart</hi> than formerly; Men under troubles of Conſcience, are wont to ſee much of the Corruption of their hearts, and they ſee that which is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to lead them to all ſorts of wickedneſs; and becauſe God is angry with them, they are afraid he will not keep them, but avenge himſelf on them, by leaving them to ſuch wickedneſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That God is now ſtriving with him in order to his Eternal Good; God is exerciſing
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001716_0037_0FB74C6F1338D660"/>a great deal of mercy, and he has no cauſe to conclude that God will ſo leave him; though God might juſtly do it, yet he has reaſon <hi>to hope in God</hi> to preſerve him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That it is fit he ſhould be humbled under the ſenſe of the depravedneſs of his nature, &amp; be ſenfible of the inſufficiency of his own Righteouſneſs, to bring him into the Favour of God, his heart being a ſink of all manner of Sin; he can never be juſtified but by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That his beſt way is to make haſte <hi>to get into a Converted Condition.</hi> If he were once Converted, he would not be in ſo much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to fall into <hi>great Tranſgreſſions;</hi> becauſe he would have then an holy principle to reſiſt temptations to Sin; and then he would have an Intereſt in the Favour of God; &amp; it would be more hopeful that God would preſerve him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Another Temptation</hi> is, That he <hi>ſhall get a falſe hope,</hi> and ſo ſatisfie himſelf that he is in a good Eſtate, when he is far from it; he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands that it is ſo with many: <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.12. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17. In this Caſe the Miniſter may tell him,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That he is <hi>indeed in danger of it,</hi> both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the pride of his ſpirit, ready to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie his own performances; and becauſe of his fears of Hell, the tediouſneſs of thoſe fears make him ready to catch at any appearances of Converſion, and therefore he had need be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001716_0038_0FB74C7097213038"/>careful; it is good for him <hi>to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what Converſion is,</hi> and what <hi>Preparation</hi> there muſt be in order thereunto; and if there be appearances to him at any time as if he were Converted, his way is to examine them thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and get the help of ſome that are skilful before he ſettle himſelf much in that perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That he muſt <hi>leave himſelf as to that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Hands of God:</hi> it is beyond his own power to deliver himſelf: if God delight in him, he will carry him through all the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Work, and ſhew him the right way; it may be God may have purpoſes of grace to him, and if ſo, he will <hi>ſhew him the path of life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Another Temptation is,</hi> That <hi>Satan will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to him.</hi> This is a great terrour to him; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially he is poſſeſſed with this fear when he withdraws himſelf to <hi>Secret Prayers:</hi> ſometimes this makes him neglect his duty, ſometimes it makes him attend it with diſtraction. In this Caſe the Miniſter may tell him,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That he is <hi>under Gods keeping;</hi> and that when he is doing his duty, he is under God's protection. There is leſs reaſon to be afraid of <hi>Satans appearing</hi> at that time, than at many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times; it is not Gods manner to ſuffer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan to appear at ſuch times.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That if Satan had power and liberty to appear to him, it is not probable, that he would fright him with the expectations <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:001716_0039_0FB74C77F6748D40"/>it; he would not give ſuch notice of his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming; but his deſign in terrifying of him, is to prevent him from doing that which might be ſerviceable to his Soul.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That it is too much honour to Satan, to be ſo far out-bid with the temptation, as to change the time of his prayer; but if he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attend his duty ſuitably, and the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on do prove too overbearing to him, it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to attend the duty by day-light.</p>
            <p>I may add to this Caſe <hi>another</hi> that now and then happens, that he ſays he has heard <hi>ſome voice, ſeen ſome ſhape, felt ſomething on him;</hi> this I apprehend at leaſt ſometimes to be only the effect of <hi>strong imagination:</hi> a <hi>ſtrong fancy</hi> may make men to imagine ſuch things; as it is with perſons in <hi>their dreams,</hi> and with <hi>distracted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;</hi> all Senſation is in the brain, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by ſome diſorder of that, men may think they ſee, feel, or hear things which they do not ſee, feel or hear.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Another Temptation is,</hi> That it is beſt <hi>to deſtroy himſelf;</hi> many have been urged to this, ſome have attempted it, and ſome have performed it, as <hi>Judas</hi> did. In this Caſe the Miniſter may tell him,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Devil is very active in this temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> though he has that in his own heart, that may lead him to it; yet it's Satan that ſtirs him up thereunto. The Devil entred into <hi>Judas</hi> when he betrayed Chriſt, and was
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001716_0040_0FB74C7B17FFB510"/>not gone out of him when he deſtroyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The Devil has a <hi>double deſign</hi> in it; <hi>one is</hi> to ſecure the man, he is afraid he ſhall loſe him, now he is troubled about his Condition, and is taking pains for Salvation. Satan is jealous leſt he will eſcape out of his hands, and labours to make him deſtroy himſelf, that he may preſently ſecure him, then there will be no danger of his running away. <hi>The other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign</hi> is to bring a reproach upon trouble of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and diſcourage others from giving way to Convictions. If there be but one ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in a <hi>Town,</hi> that will make many others to ſtifle Convictions, leſt they ſhould come to the like End.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That there is <hi>good reaſon to hope that he may obtain Salvation.</hi> It is diſcouragement that leads men to ſuch practices: And if he have but conſiderable hope of obtaining peace with God, there is not much danger of his hearken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the temptation; therefore ſuch things may be ſuggeſted, as are proper to bear up his heart, as that the Spirit of God is ſtriving with him in order to his Salvation; that Satan is afraid he will be ſaved, that his ſins are no other than what God has pardoned oftentimes, and the like.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That it is a <hi>dreadful ſin to deſtroy himſelf.</hi> It is a ſin againſt nature, it is unthankfulneſs for Gods mercy in ſaving his life; that this is far worſe than other ſins that are very terrifying
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001716_0041_0FB74C7C9C08F8B0"/>to him; this is the way to throw himſelf im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately <hi>into endleſs miſery.</hi> Whatever may be ſaid of the poſſibility of the Salvation of ſuch perſons, there is no reaſon to think that one in a thouſand is ſaved; this ſin is heinous, and quickly cuts off their opportunities: Such a man as is tempted to this Sin, would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to <hi>tell a lye,</hi> or to <hi>prophane the Sabbath;</hi> how much more has he reaſon to fear this ſin, which will bring him preſently to Eternal Damnation? It is a poor remedy to deliver himſelf from anguiſh, to throw himſelf into that, which is unſpeakably greater; certain damnation is far more dreadful than the fears they are oppreſſed by: this will make their condition much worſe, and not better.</p>
            <p>SOMETIMES he complains of a <hi>ſelf-righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Spirit;</hi> that he is ready to truſt to every thing he does: that eſpecially when he feels any affections, he is proud of them, and ready to make a righteouſneſs of them: In this Caſe it may be profitable,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To convince him of the inſufficiency of his own righteouſneſs to ſave him:</hi> that his own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs will not bring him into favour with God; for his own righteouſneſs is utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, and ſo falls ſhort of what the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth. The Law ſtands for perfect Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but he never did perform one perfect act of Obedience: all his Obedience is ſtained with Corruption. Beſides, while he is in a
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001716_0042_0FB74C7F51FA5738"/>Natural Condition, he does nothing ſincerely, but is an Hypocrite in all his performances; and accordingly God is ſo far from juſtifying of him for the ſake of them, that he will not accept of him, but holds him guilty for the ſake of them. Beſides, his own righteouſneſs han't the nature of ſatisfaction in it; there can be <hi>no ſatisfaction for ſin, but by bearing the Curſe of the Law.</hi> Obedience is a natural debt, and cannot ſatisfie for his contracted debts; if our Obedience would have procured our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, there would have been no need of the Death of Chriſt: Chriſt's Death would be in vain, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.21.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>To direct him how to get delivered from this ſelf-righteous ſpirit,</hi> viz. <hi>by getting an understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the badneſs of his own heart:</hi> for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t him hear never ſo often of the vanity of his own righteouſneſs, yet he will truſt to it, till he ſees he has none, and can get none. A thorow diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of his own heart, will break him off from truſting in himſelf; for then he will ſee nothing in himſelf to truſt in: he will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid becauſe of his duties, his ſtrong holds will all be thrown down; but a <hi>notional conviction</hi> of the inſufficiency of his own righteouſneſs to ſave him, without an <hi>experimental conviction of the badneſs of his heart,</hi> will not deliver him from confidence in himſelf.</p>
            <p>SOMETIMES he complains that he does <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing from a ſpirit of ſelf-love:</hi> he don't aim
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:001716_0043_0FB74C806DF51B30"/>at the Glory of God in any thing; <hi>but fear of Hell, and deſire of Salvation,</hi> are the great things that do ſet him on work: were it not for fear of Hell he ſhould leave off. In this Caſe he may be told,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That it is impoſſible he ſhould act from at higher principle.</hi> He has no principle of love to God, <hi>Job.</hi> 5.42. Self-love is the reigning prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in him, and therefore it is no wonder that he does all in Religion from that ſpirit; it was his weakneſs that he formerly thought he did any thing out of love to God. No Natural man ever did act with an higher ſpirit, then a ſpirit of ſelf-love: <hi>A bad Tree cannot bring forth good fruit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That he ſhould make uſe of this for Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not for Diſcouragement.</hi> There is no reaſon that he ſhould be diſcouraged becauſe of this, for every one is an Hypocrite at firſt; and many that have ſought God for a while with a ſelfiſh-ſpirit, have afterward been turned, and have had another ſpirit given to them: but he ſhould make uſe of this to his Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and learn hereby his own badneſs, the inſufficiency of his own righteouſneſs, and the juſtice of his Condemnation, and that he has no cauſe to think much that God does reject his Services, and not give peace unto him.</p>
            <p>After this the Sinner gives an account that he finds a <hi>ſpirit of love to God, ſorrow for
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001716_0044_0FB74C831C1139F8"/>Sin, aiming at the Glory of God, hating of Sin, &amp;c.</hi> In this Caſe he may be told,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there is a <hi>great reſemblance between common and ſaving Grace:</hi> Common Grace is the picture of Sanctifying Grace, and common af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are ſometimes ſtronger than ſaving. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> juſtifies God, <hi>Saul</hi> weeps, <hi>one</hi> who was far from ſincerity, tells Chriſt, <hi>he will follow him whitherſoever he goeth,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> cry, <hi>Hoſanna to the Son of David,</hi> the <hi>Iſraelites ſang Gods praiſe, but ſoon forgat his works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That while they have ſuch pangs of affection, it will be very hard for them to ſee their Hypocriſie.</hi> Their fear of Damnation makes them catch at any appearances of ſincerity, and their pride makes them have an high opinion of their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments; men ſometimes in that frame make ſuch ſigns as do indeed ſhew their hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie to be arguments of their ſincerity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That it is a very dangerous thing for them to think that they are ſincere, while they are not:</hi> then they will bleſs themſelves, when God curſes them; then they will continue quietly in a Natural Condition, and neglect the means of Converſion: and if they don't ſee the deceit quickly, there is danger that they may grow ſo hard-hearted, that if they do ſee it afterwards, they will not be the better for it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>That they may be ſatisfied from ſuch things as theſe, that they don't love God ſincerely, whatever appearances there be,</hi> viz. <hi>That they never had a
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:001716_0045_0FB74C8781CF8810"/>work of Humiliation;</hi> and ſincerity does never forego that: that they never <hi>Cloſed with Jeſus Christ,</hi> and the heart is never <hi>purified without Faith.</hi> All thoſe affections that go before faith, let them be never ſo ſtrong, are deceitful; the firſt good action that any man does perform, is to give entertainment to the Goſpel: other things follow upon that.</p>
            <p>SOMETIMES he gives an account, <hi>that he does believe on Jeſus Christ;</hi> he don't truſt in his own righteouſneſs, but places his hope in Chriſt. In this Caſe the Miniſter may tell him,</p>
            <p>That there is a great deal of faith that does not juſtifie. Some do believe for a time, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.13. <hi>ſome receive the word with joy, and in time of temptation fall away,</hi> Mat. 13.20, 21. Some <hi>believed on Christ, but did not confeſs him, Job.</hi> 12.42. ſeveral <hi>ſorts of faith</hi> do not <hi>justifie:</hi> As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. An <hi>Hiſtorical Faith.</hi> Men do receive the <hi>History of the Goſpel</hi> for a truth, and take it for granted, that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God, and Saviour of the World; and if any ſhould deny it, or diſpute againſt it, they would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry zealous againſt him, it would ſtir up their indignation; if they have any workings of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, yet generally they go with that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, <hi>that the Goſpel is true;</hi> but this is no more than a <hi>Turk</hi> will ſay for his Religion: this <hi>Hiſtorical Faith,</hi> don't mortifie mens corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>John</hi> 2.23, 24, 25. many profane man have this Hiſtorical Faith.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:001716_0046_0FB74C89C172AE88"/>
2. <hi>A conſiderable confidence that Christ will ſave them.</hi> They are perſwaded that they ſhall obtain Salvation by Chriſt, and do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the hope of it: This Confidence is a diſtinct thing from Juſtifying Faith; it is <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad</hi> according to the <hi>grounds</hi> of it. Godly men have frequently ſuch a confidence from the experience of a work of Grace in their own hearts, and the manifeſtation of the Love of God; but this is not <hi>Juſtifying Faith,</hi> but a <hi>Faith of Aſſurance.</hi> Carnal Men may have ſuch a confidence, ariſing from an imagination that God loves them, and from a ſenſe of their own goodneſs; but this is not <hi>Justifying Faith,</hi> but <hi>Preſumption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>A depending upon Christ, on the incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of a mans own goodneſs.</hi> He hears the Goſpel, or has ſome common Illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, diſcovering ſomewhat of God's readineſs to pardon Sinners through Chriſt: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering what he is, he ventures on Chriſt. When a man ſavingly believes, he ventures upon Chriſt upon <hi>Goſpel incouragements;</hi> but another ventures, being incouraged from the conſideration of his Prayers, Tears, Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enſciouſneſs, or on that incouragement that he is not very bad, ſo he thinks ſuch an one as he may venture; whereas if he did ſee himſelf ſo bad as indeed he is, he would not venture on Chriſt; the man makes partly his <hi>own righteouſneſs,</hi> and partly the <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:001716_0047_0FB74C90F2829A60"/>of Christ</hi> the foundation of his Faith; he does not exclude the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, but the preponderating conſideration, and that which eſpecially imboldens him to venture, is his own righteouſneſs; his own righteouſneſs is the firſt foundation of his hope, though he takes in the plea alſo of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt; he ſees enough in Chriſt for ſuch an one as himſelf, but not for the worſt of Sinners.</p>
            <p>But poſſibly he will plead for himſelf, That he was <hi>much affected with Christ,</hi> and with the mercy of God, it was more than ordinary, he never had ſuch a light before. In this Caſe he may be told, That Carnal men have ſometimes ſuperficial diſcoveries of Chriſt, and are affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therewith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.20. men have conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>inlightnings and tasts, yet may fall away;</hi> and it is no wonder they ſhould be affected with the mercy of God: if men do apprehend that God has pardoned them, they cannot but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> affected with it: as pardon does affect men, ſo does Imaginary pardon.</p>
            <p>He may further plead for himſelf, That it was <hi>juſt ſo with him, as it has been with Godly men,</hi> as he has heard them to expreſs themſelves; that all his objections were anſwered; he was backward before, but he had ſuch a diſcovery of Chriſt, that <hi>all his objections did vaniſh away,</hi> and he had nothing to ſay.</p>
            <p>But he may be told, that the reaſon why
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:001716_0048_0FB74C925318FA20"/>ſome mens objections are all anſwered, is not from the greatneſs of the light that God gave them, but <hi>from their ignorance of their own hearts.</hi> They did not ſee ſo much of their own bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as thorowly to feel the power of an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting ſpirit; if they had ſeen how bad they were, their objections would not have been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. A little matter will anſwer the obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of an ignorant and conceited man, they have not light enough to make ſuch ſtrong ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections as they would do if they knew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> all their objections are eaſily anſwered.</p>
            <p>SOMETIMES he builds his Confidence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome PARTICULAR SCRIPTURES.</p>
            <p>ONE <hi>Scripture</hi> is, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14. <hi>We know that we are paſſed from death to life, becauſe we love the brethren:</hi> He ſays he finds ſuch a ſpirit in himſelf, and he thinks his Condition good. But he may be told,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>There is a great difference between loving the People of God for their Plety, and honouring them for their Piety.</hi> Many Natural men have ſome Convictions that Godly men are choice men, and happy men; and if they think a man is a ſincere man, they <hi>honour</hi> him, and have a reſpect for him; ſo <hi>Herod</hi> had for <hi>John, Mark</hi> 6.20. but theſe men have not a ſincere love to them for their Piety; they don't love God nor Godlineſs, therefore don't love Godly men for their Piety.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:001716_0049_0FB74C93E0226508"/>
2. <hi>There is a great difference between loving Godly men for their Piety, and loving them for their Morality.</hi> Godly men are moral men ſome of them are eminent for Juſtice, Sobriety and Faithfulneſs, and theſe are very lovely things in the eyes of many natural men; they love them upon that account, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.3.18. <hi>Darius</hi> had a great love to <hi>Daniel,</hi> but it was not upon the account of his Piety, but his Prudence and Morality: Morality is lovely in the eyes of many carnal men. Some love Godly men, becauſe they are <hi>related to them;</hi> ſome becauſe they are <hi>friendly to them,</hi> and ſome becauſe of their <hi>moral qualifications,</hi> that have not any love to them upon the account of their Piety. The moral Carriages of the People of God flow from a ſpirit of Piety; but Morality &amp; Piety are very different things, and ſome perſons that have a love to them upon the account of their Morality, may have no love to them upon the account of their Piet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
            </p>
            <p>Another Scripture that he may build a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence on, is, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Whoſoever believeth that Jeſus is the Chriſt, is born of God.</hi> By this Rule he ſays he is in a good condition, he does believe this, therefore is Regenerate. In this Caſe he may be told,</p>
            <p>That the believing here ſpoken of, is the receiving of it as <hi>certain upon the teſtimony of God.</hi> Many men have a common perſwaſion that Chriſt is the Son of God from <hi>tradition,</hi> and from <hi>his Miracles,</hi> which is in a more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:001716_0050_0FB74C9BE7D27928"/>acceptation called believing. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.23. and yet they are not <hi>born of God:</hi> but more properly they are ſaid to believe it, who receive it, upon God's teſtimony; and thoſe men who have only a <hi>common perſwaſion,</hi> are indeed Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; they that have not Grace, don't pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly believe the Word of God.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER <hi>Scripture</hi> that he takes notice of to ſtrengthen his confidence, is, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Bleſſed are they that hunger and thirst after Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs;</hi> his Conſcience teſtifies that he does ſo, therefore he hopes he is bleſſed. In this Caſe he may be told,</p>
            <p>That though <hi>ſome</hi> deſires of grace are grace, yet <hi>all deſires</hi> of grace are not grace: As men may act hypocritically when they pretend to deſire grace, ſo when they do deſire grace. For</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Many Carnal men do deſire Grace.</hi> It is a common thing for Ungodly men to deſire Grace, eſpecially when terrified with the word, they deſire to be Converted: Some men have ſlighter Convictions, and they have faint and languiſhing deſires, and ſome have more ſmart terrours, and they have more earneſt deſires to be Converted: they think they would give all that they have in the World, that they were Converted: So the <hi>Fooliſh Virgins,</hi> Mat. 25.8.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Deſires of Grace may ariſe from natural prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</hi> Grace is not only deſirable, for its own ſake, but there are <hi>ſeveral benefits</hi> that do at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it, which may make natural principles
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:001716_0051_0FB74C9F47CF4098"/>crave it. Grace is an <hi>honourable thing, Heb.</hi> 11.2. it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> among men, it procures men a good name in the World; hence <hi>Pride</hi> makes men crave it: Grace is a means of many out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bleſſings, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. And upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, men out of a ſelfiſh ſpirit may deſire it; grace is neceſſary in order to <hi>Salvation, Heb.</hi> 12.14. And upon this account, nature makes men crave it.</p>
            <p>AFTER he is <hi>delivered from his confident o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of his good estate,</hi> and ſees himſelf to be in a natural condition ſtill; it may be needful upon that occaſion,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To encourage him:</hi> For he is in danger to be too much caſt down, ſo as to hinder his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture diligence: He may be encouraged from the conſideration of <hi>Gods Goodneſs</hi> in diſcovering that deceit which would have proved his bane; he was in a dangerous way, but God has delivered him, and ſo put him into a nearer capacity to be Converted: Gods not ſuffering him to continue in his deluſion, is an hopeful ſign, that God does intend mercy to him; he is now under greater advantage than before. <hi>John</hi> 9.4.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>To war<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> him that he don't run into the ſame error again; for he is still under the reigning pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of a ſelf-righteous ſpirit, and may get a falſe opinion of Converſion again.</hi> Some do ſeveral, times ſtrike upon that rock, therefore he muſt be cautioned not to be deceived with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:001716_0052_0FB74CA091C22098"/>of grace; nor to give way to the flattery of his own heart; if he ſhould take up ſuch a perſwaſion again, it is doubtful that he would not be delivered, relapſes are dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; and if he ſhould begin to think ſo, it were beſt to adviſe with thoſe that can inform him, before he be confirmed in ſuch an opinion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>To lead him into the underſtanding of his own badneſs, and inſufficiency to help himſelf.</hi> This is an advantageous time to drive him out of himſelf, and bring on the work of Converſion. When he ſees his own hypocriſie, the beſt way is to follow, till he is quite emptied of himſelf; it is good policy to improve a victory, and to help him to a thorow ſight of himſelf, that he may be prepared for Chriſt.</p>
            <p>SOMETIMES after a man has been ſeeking a while, and has paſſed thorow many Changes, <hi>there is reaſon to fear that he will leave off, he has a great deal of diſcouragement;</hi> others obtain, and he is left; God don't make the Word powerful on his heart, he don't get forward, and it may be perceived, that he is more ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than he was. In this Caſe it is beſt,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To encourage him:</hi> for the diſcouragements that he is under, are a great cauſe of <hi>Apostacy;</hi> therefore it is beſt to hearten him up: the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the giant-like ſtature of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and the <hi>ſtrength of their</hi> Walls, was a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement to <hi>Iſrael</hi> to entertain thoughts of <hi>returning back to Egypt.</hi> So it is in this
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:001716_0053_0FB74CA21933A518"/>Caſe: And he may be encouraged <hi>two ways.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>By ſhewing him the poſſibility of his obtaining mercy.</hi> So <hi>Caleb</hi> told the people they were well able to overcome, and if God delighted in them, he would bring them in; thus he may be encouraged, by ſhewing of him that God can help him, and that nothing does appear to ſhew that God will not help him; his mercy is free, he has pardoned others as bad as he; his Providences to him are conſiſtent with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of Grace.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>By ſhewing him the wonderful benefit that he will have if he does obtain mercy; beſides that peace and communion with God which he will have in this Life, he will enjoy Eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the other World, which is inconceiveaby great.</hi> It were a great thing to have his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments moderated, much more to be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from them; it were a great thing to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of Hell, after hundreds of years, grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be preſerved from coming there: It were a great thing to be kept out of Hell, and ſuffered to live a natural life always upon the Earth; greater to be tranſlated into the <hi>glorious preſence of God, and to be like the Angels of God</hi> always beholding the face of the Father; it is worth the while to go thorow any difficulty for Heaven; Heaven will make amends for all: if all the way to Heaven were Rocks and Mountains, yet it is worth the while to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel thither. The People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:001716_0054_0FB74CA3925DD7E0"/>told of the excellency of the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> that it was a <hi>Land flowing with milk and honey, and a land of vineyards, and olive-yards, &amp; wheat and barley:</hi> So it is uſeful to ſet before him the glorious Happineſs that the People of God will enjoy in another World.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>To warn him of his danger, for ſecurity has a great hand in Apostacy; to remember him what a miſerable condition he would caſt himſelf into, if he ſhould caſt off fear, and restrain Prayer before God.</hi> Sometimes when men Apoſtatiſe, they fall into deſpair; and God ſuffers them to be miſerably hurried and haunted by their own evil Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and no means can deliver them; ſo it was with <hi>Judas.</hi> Sometimes God ſhortens their days, and don't ſuffer them to continue in this world: When they draw back, God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws protection from them, and they quickly dye: When they neglect ſeeking Eternal Life, God denies temporal life to them; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he leaves them to be very wicked; they ſometimes become of the number of the baſeſt of men. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20, 21, 22. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.44, 45. and they are in dreadful danger of Eternal Fire; and that miſery that no Creature knows how to grapple with. Such Conſiderations as theſe may help him againſt the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>SOMETIMES he complains he is followed with <hi>Atheistical thoughts;</hi> he is frequently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:001716_0055_0FB74CA99146E5B8"/>with queſtions about the Being of God In this Caſe the Miniſter may,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Acquaint him that though this is a great ſin, yet it may be forgiven.</hi> There is abundance of <hi>Atheiſm</hi> in the hearts of men, the lives of men ſhew that they have much of this ſpirit <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.16. And many perſons that have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of this, have been afterward Convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and that ſome Godly men are much exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed with this temptation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.12, 13. And therefore though he ſhould not make light of it, yet he ſhould not draw up any dark concluſions againſt the poſſibility of his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Convince him that there is a God;</hi> and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle his heart about that great Truth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>By evidencing to him the Being of God, which he may do, eſpecially from the Works of Creation thus.</hi> The things which we ſee, are made things; they are finite, compounded, corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and therefore it is impoſſible they ſhould be of themſelves; that which is finite, is not Eternal, but was made in time, out of nothing; that which is compounded, was compounded by ſome other thing; that which is corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, has not its being from it ſelf; we could not be of our ſelves, and therefore the Firſt man, who was of the ſame nature with us, could not be of himſelf; and he that made theſe things, muſt be an Infinitely Glorious God: He that could bring the World out of
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:001716_0056_0FB74CADDE3DDDF8"/>nothing, and make the Creatures that are therein, with wonderful variety of properties and vertues muſt be one of infinite perfection, this is God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.1.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>By removing thoſe Objections that prove ſnares to him: If that be a ſnare to him, that we do not ſee God:</hi> He may be told, That we don't que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion many other things which we never ſaw. We doubt not that there are ſuch Countries as <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> Several things are inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as the Souls of Men, Angels and Devils, unleſs they affirme a Shape; yet we may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied about theſe: There be other ways to ſatisfie us about the Exiſtence of things, beſides ſeeing of them. We know ſome things by <hi>reaſon,</hi> and ſome things by <hi>faith, Heb.</hi> 11.3. If that be a temptation to him, that others don't <hi>believe the Being of God,</hi> he can plainly perceive by the lives of men, that whatever they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, they do not really think that there is a God: He may be told, That though they are not fully perſwaded, that there is a God, yet they cannot be fully perſwaded that there is not a God; they have ſo much light that they cannot extinguiſh it; there is not a <hi>perfect A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt</hi> in the World: Beſides, Carnal men are led by their Corruptions, and their reaſon is very much darkned, and there is no weight to be laid upon their thoughts. Shall we think here be no <hi>Antipodes,</hi> becauſe ſome ignorant men denied it? Shall we queſtion the round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:001716_0057_0FB74CB133FCDE50"/>of the Earth, becauſe ſome others think otherwiſe? We may not offer violence to our reaſon, becauſe of the ſottiſhneſs of other men. If that be a ſnare to him, to conceive <hi>how God can be of himſelf;</hi> how it is poſſible he ſhould be, without being made: He may be told.

               </gap> that is <hi>not contrary to reaſon;</hi> as it is to think that a company of finite things, ſhould be of themſelves: Beſides, if there are beings, there muſt of neceſſity be ſome Firſt Being: If the reſt be made, yet there muſt be one that was not made: To ſay that nothing was made, and to ſay that all things are made, are alike ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd; thoſe things that are made could not have been, unleſs there were ſomething that was not made; ſeeing many things have a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there muſt be one of them that is of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; they could not interchangeably make one another, but there is one who was not made, <hi>but is of himſelf,</hi> who is GOD.</p>
            <p>SOMETIMES he complains that he is fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with <hi>horrible injections, blaſphemous tho'ts, and other wicked thoughts,</hi> that are a great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction to him, and take away the comfort of his life, they make him a terrour to himſelf. In this Caſe he may be told,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That ſo far as they are injected by Satan, they are not imputed to him.</hi> The heart of man, is very bad, and from that fountain of ſin, exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wicked thoughts may ariſe; but when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:001716_0058_0FB74CB2925C2A30"/>are violently followed with ſuch thoughts, they are uſually injected by Satan, they are ſome of his <hi>fiery darts</hi> ſpoken of, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.16. And when he caſts them in, the man is no more guilty, than he that hears a man blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheme: if a man were perfect'y holy, that could not prevent ſuch injections if God let Satan looſe upon him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That his Nature is ſo corrupted, that thoſe injections do leſs or more taint him.</hi> The heart is like tinder, and theſe, temptations will make ſome impreſſion, though he has a deteſtation of thoſe thoughts, and labours againſt them, yet there is a principle in the heart to fall in with them; and generally upon ſuch occaſions, perſons do contract guilt; and it is but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3. <hi>That ſuch temptations are no ſign that God don't love him; he may not gather from thence, that God has given him up to Satan; for this has been the condition of ſome very Godly men.</hi> This is an exerciſe that God has brought upon ſome that have been dear to him: As <hi>Satan</hi> is wont to tempt the beſt of men, ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>his is not too great an affliction to be bro't
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:001716_0059_0FB74CB4D0EA42E0"/>upon ſuch men as God does love; the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil may in this manner hurry thoſe that he ſhall not be able to deſtroy. <hi>Paul</hi> in like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood had ſome ſuch temptations, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. God for holy ends may ſuffer thoſe whom he loves to be thus exerciſed, that they may leave their own weakneſs, and be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled before God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>That it is not very uſual for God to ſuffer men to be long followed with theſe injections.</hi> Tho' there be ſome inſtances to the contrary, yet more ordinarily after a while God does re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain <hi>Satan,</hi> though no man can determine any preciſe time, yet after a while they are wont to be removed. God may ſo far hear Prayers, as to remove this affliction.</p>
            <p>SOMETIMES he <hi>complains bitterly of the badneſs of his own heart,</hi> ſpeaks of it as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding bad; he ſays he never ſaw it ſo bad as of late, and ſeems to be almoſt diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged thereby. In this Caſe he may be told,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the heart of every natural man is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding bad.</hi> Many times through reſtraints of corruption and common grace, the badneſs of it is hidden; but the <hi>heart of every natural man is deſperately wicked,</hi> Jer. 17.9. Whatever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances it may make, it is utterly corrupt; every ſin is unmortifyed: thoſe ſins that they have not been accuſtomed to, thoſe ſins that their tempers don't diſpoſe them to; thoſe ſins of whoſe baſeneſs they have the deepeſt ſence &amp; their hearts are totally empty of all goodneſs,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:001716_0060_0FB74CB6C37F85E8"/>there is not one ſpark of goodneſs in them: that the principle of ſin is as ſtrong in them after they are inlightened &amp; reformed as ever it was.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That it is neceſſary for him to be convinced of the badneſs of his own heart.</hi> When men ſee the badneſs of their own hearts, they are ready to be diſcouraged, but they are then in a more hopeful condition than before: If men be ſtrangers to their own hearts, they will truſt in themſelves, and neglect Chriſt. God firſt diſcovers to them what they are, and then he diſcovers the excellency of Chriſt to them: men will <hi>never come to Chriſt, till they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced what corrupt, blind and dead creatures they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e.</hi> And therefore the more God ſhews him of the badneſs of his heart, the more graciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he deals with him: The badneſs of the heart is matter of ſorrow, but the ſight of that badneſs is matter of incouragement; the more they ſee of that, the more hope there is of their being prepared for Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That it is his beſt way to ſearch his own heart further.</hi> Many times men will complain bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly of the badneſs of their own hearts, and one time after another give an account that they have ſeen more in their hearts than over they did before; and yet are far from ſeeing what they muſt ſee in their own hearts. And while it is thus, they ſhould be put upon it to ſtudy their hearts, that they may ſee more of them: Perſons are afraid to ſee their own
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:001716_0061_0FB74CB952583E48"/>hearts, and are wont to ſtrive againſt it, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to perſwade themſelves that they are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than indeed they be: it croſſes their pride, and their falſe hopes, to ſee the badneſs of their own hearts; therefore there is need to ſtir them up thereunto, and to tell them of what conſequence it is. The ſight of the heart is like the opening of a feſtered wound, it prepares men for healing; they ſhould be put upon it to ſearch themſelves, and led into the way to do it: particular things may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to them to ſearch after; <hi>this is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry material thing,</hi> for the ſincerity of their Converſion has a great dependance upon the thorow knowledge of their hearts.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Whether at this time it is not best to urge him to believe on Christ, though he does not thorowly underſtand the badneſs of his own heart?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It may not be amiſs while he is in this condition, <hi>to mind him that it is his duty to believe in Chriſt.</hi> And to ſet forth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Excellency and Sufficiency of Chriſt before him, it may be ſeveral ways beneficial to him; it may help him to take notice of the contrariety and oppoſition of his heart to this duty, and lead him into a further underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the corruption of his Nature; it may give ſome check to that ſpirit of ſelf-righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs that prevails in him, and make him ſenſible of the neceſſity of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt unto his Juſtification; it may ſerve
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:001716_0062_0FB74CC1C7799300"/>to encourage as to the poſſibility of his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and convince him, that he is capable to be brought into a ſtate of Salvation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Yet there is no ground to hope, that till he tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly ſees himſelf, he will accept the offer of the Goſpel.</hi> Men muſt be firſt humbled before they will believe. Invitations to come to Chriſt will never be ſucceſful, till men are driven out from all their falſe refuges; they may hear the moſt powerful <hi>arguments</hi> with a great deal of evidence and affection, but they will not be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient; either they will be afraid to come to Chriſt, and have one thing or other to object; they will be fearful, becauſe they ſee ſo much ſin, or becauſe they don't know that God means them, or they have not the inward Call of the Goſpel. Under ſome notion or other they will not come, or elſe they will <hi>come in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>reſumptuous</hi> manner, and pretend to believe, when they do not indeed believe: Either they will be born down with <hi>Unbelief,</hi> or they will get a <hi>falſe Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SOMETIMES <hi>the man complains that he has not encouraging Scriptures come to him,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he fears that he is not under the work of the <hi>Spirit:</hi> Other men have encouraging Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures brought to them, and therefore God don't deal with him, as with thoſe he is wont to Convert. In this Caſe the Miniſter may tell him,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That if he have ſupporting conſiderations cast
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:001716_0063_0FB74CC317C8B6F0"/>into his heart, that is ſufficient;</hi> there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to have incouraging Scriptures to come with a great deal of power upon his heart; there is need of ſome ſupporting conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to maintain an hope, and to keep him from deſpair: and if the heart be but ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an hope that he may obtain at laſt, that is ſufficient. God deals very variouſly with men; ſome that have many encouraging Scriptures, do never obtain mercy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That if he does continue to wait upon God, he may have encouraging Scriptures come to him after a while.</hi> God knows what he ſtands in need of, <hi>and don't tie up himſelf to the ſame method, as to the circumstances of the work:</hi> He uſes a great deal of variety; ſcarce two perſons are carried on exactly after the ſame manner; ſome have more incouragement towards the beginning, &amp; others towards the latter end of the work.</p>
            <p>SOMETIMES he ſays, <hi>that if he were ſure to obtain, he could be willing to take any pains:</hi> Yea, though God ſhould hold him waiting a long while; and he could be content to go through any anguiſh of ſpirit; but that which ſinks his heart and makes him dull, is, that he is not certain of ſucceſs. In this Caſe he may be told by the Miniſter,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That all that have obtained mercy, have ſought upon the in incouragement that they might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain mercy.</hi> They did not know what the iſſue of it would be; the poſſibility of it was that
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:001716_0064_0FB74CC61A9E5C90"/>which bore up their hearts in uſing of means; they had ſome hope mingle, with fear, and if they had not ſought upon the incouragement of the poſſibility, they had certainly gone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mercy. The <hi>Sick man</hi> does not ſay he will not uſe means, unleſs he were certain of a <hi>Cure:</hi> The <hi>Merchant</hi> don't ſay that he will not ſend his Ship to Sea, unleſs he were certain of a proſperous Voyage: The <hi>Husbandman</hi> don't ſay that he will not Plow and Sow his Land, unleſs he were certain of a good Crop; Men muſt wait upon God, upon this encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they may obtain mercy, <hi>Jon.</hi> 2.8, 9.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That the meer loſs of their pains is a ſmall matter.</hi> It will be a dreadful thing for a man to loſe his Soul; but the meer loſs of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is a ſmall matter. A man may well ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the loſs of his labour, in hope of the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his Soul: A man that is ſick, will venture the loſs of a little expence for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of his life: Men have no cauſe to be very ſcrupulous about the loſs of their pains: The loſs of their Souls will be far ſorer.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>It is not fit that men ſhould be ſure to obtain mercy, till they do believe in Christ.</hi> There is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity enough, <hi>that if they do believe in Christ, they ſhall be ſaved:</hi> And there is no reaſon that God ſhould be deſired to make a <hi>New-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> and ſecure Salvation <hi>to any other Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> God has deſcended low enough when he promiſe Salvation to <hi>believing;</hi> and it is too
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:001716_0065_0FB74CC9374D9BA8"/>much for any man to deſire that God ſhould promiſe it to <hi>Praying,</hi> to <hi>Reading,</hi> to <hi>Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c.</hi> Eſpecially ſeeing thoſe things are done with a falſe heart, only for Salvation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>If men be thorowly ſcared with the danger of Damnation, they will readily improve their poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and not ſtand for aſſurance of ſucceſs.</hi> Men will be glad of a poſſibility, and not neglect means, becauſe they have no more incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: If a man be caſt into the Sea, he will not neglect Swimming, becauſe he is not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that he can ſwim to the Shore: If a man be <hi>purſued by an Enemy,</hi> he will not ſtand ſtill, becauſe he is not certain that he ſhall get clear. If men ſtand convinced of their dreadful dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in neglecting to ſeek, they will betake themſelves to the uſe of means at a venture, rather than run the hazard of their Souls.</p>
            <p>SOMETIMES <hi>he complains that after he has told the Minister how it is with him, it ſeems to him as if he had told a company of lies;</hi> and he is terrified with the apprehenſion of it. In this Caſe he may be told,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That theſe tho'ts riſe partly from the fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of his Conſcience.</hi> He is in a terrified condition, and ſo the ſound of a ſhaking leaf will ſcare him; and <hi>he flees when none purſueth;</hi> he imagines dangers where there be none; he has a humbling guilty Conſcience, and is afraid that he ſins when he don't, and is ready to charge things upon himſelf without cauſe.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="47" facs="unknown:001716_0066_0FB74CCDD9D57EB0"/>
2. <hi>That theſe thoughts ariſe from thoſe contrary workings that are in his own heart.</hi> Sometimes he has a great ſence of danger, ſometimes he has but little ſence of it: ſometimes he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid he has committed the <hi>Unpardonable Sin,</hi> and then he is not afraid of it: he has great variety and change of frames, and whatever account he gives of the workings of his own heart, he has had ſome contrary workings thereunto; ſo that after he has told what wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings of heart he had, he has reflections, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he remembers ſome contrary workings of heart.</p>
            <p>SOMETIMES <hi>a man that has been ſeeking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter peace with God a great while, leaves off for ſome months together,</hi> he is followed with guilt, and comes and makes his Caſe known unto the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter: In this Caſe it is very ſuitable,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To reprove him for his backſtiding, and ſet before him the ſinfulneſs of what he has done,</hi> and the danger that he has expoſed himſelf unto: he has <hi>quenched the Spirit,</hi> the tendency of whoſe motions was for his good; he has ſinned againſt a great deal of light; when he was in a more hopeful way, he has relapſed into a ſorrowful condition; he has loſt ground, and has a great deal of his work to do over again: God muſt needs be greatly provoked with him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>To encourage him notwithſtanding, by aſſuring of him, that he is capable of mercy.</hi> God invites Backſliders to return unto him: Perſons are
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:001716_0067_0FB74CD1B42C4708"/>ſometimes cured of relapſes: God has mercy enough to pardon ſuch ſins, ſeveral perſons have had experience of it: ſometimes the firſt attempt is not ſucceſsful; (as when <hi>David</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to bring the <hi>Ark</hi> into the place pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for it) but the next time he proſpered.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>To warn them that they do not ſo again.</hi> They are in great danger, becauſe they have done ſo already: A Beaſt that has once tired, is more ready to do ſo again: Thoſe tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that have prevailed upon them, are more like to prevail again; and if they get an habit of backſliding, they will be the more incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Cuſtom in any evil way, naturalizes it to men: They run more readily into the ſame.</p>
            <p>SOMETIMES <hi>a man goes on in a way of ſeeking a great while, yet ſeems to be at a ſtand,</hi> the work don't go forward: he has the ſame fears, the ſame complaints, ſees nothing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into his own heart; he is like a man in a <hi>Chronical Diſeaſe,</hi> that notwithſtanding all Medicines, continues much in the ſame po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, he is neither much worſe, nor much better; like a Ship that beats upon the Coaſt day by day, and can't get in. In this Caſe the Miniſter may,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Mind him that he may quickly die.</hi> The fence of approaching Death is very terrify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and will ſtir up men to do their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt: The face of Death is terrible, and it may be very profitable to work upon them,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:001716_0068_0FB74CD4D8658778"/>a fence that they may be quickly ſnatched away; they have the ſeeds of all Diſeaſes in them; Gods Judgments are as a light that goeth forth. Men are commonly ſnatched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way before they are aware: Many of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that went out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> did not live to go into <hi>Canaan:</hi> Their way is offenſive to God, and ſo he may take them away in his anger.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>To convince them, that they cannot make their own hearts better.</hi> One thing that makes men be at a ſtand is, that they are waiting in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation to mend their own hearts; they hope from Sabbath to Sabbath, and from one Duty to another; and though they fail hitherto of their expectation: they find that Afflictions don't do it, nor Ordinances, nor Mercies, nor Examples; yet they are promiſing themſelves that after a while, they ſhall make them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and it is fit they ſhould be convinced of the impoſſibility of that; Their hoping and waiting for that is their ſnare: They may be ſhewed how it is <hi>quite beyond their power:</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever reſolutions they take up, whatever pains they take, whatever encouragements, afflictions and terrours they have, yet it is beyond the compaſs of their power; they cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the excellency of God and Chriſt, or the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3. <hi>To poſſeſs them that God is very angry with them, notwithstanding the pains they take.</hi> For one great reaſon why they make no more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency is, becauſe they live upon their Duties; though they don't think that their Duties do juſtifie them, yet they do pacifie their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences with them; and they think that God will have a reſpect to the pains they take: they do what they can, and they do more than ſome others; and they hope they ſtand upon better terms with God than formerly; and though they ſpeak of their own badneſs, yet they i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine ſo much of their own goodneſs, as that they think it will be an <hi>hard caſe for God to damn them:</hi> Therefore they ſhould be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upon what terms they ſtand with God; that as there is no merit in their duties, ſo there is nothing to move God to pity them, nor to abate the anger of God towards them; but their beſt duties are provocations, and impated to them as ſins.</p>
            <p>SOMETIMES a man that has been <hi>in a very hopeful way</hi> quickly to get through the work of Converſion, <hi>returns again to his old postures;</hi> he had of late great Convictions of the badneſs of his own heart, the hypocriſie of his duties, the inſufficiency of any thing of his own to gain Gods favour, and has ſuch workings of heart as are wont immediately to procure ſubmiſſion
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:001716_0070_0FB74CD79276E208"/>to God, and a work of <hi>Humiliation,</hi> and in a little time tacks about, and is remote from Humiliation as he uſed to be: As the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> when they were almoſt ready to enter into <hi>Canaan,</hi> fetcht a Compaſs, and wandered a long time in the Wilderneſs. In this Caſe the Miniſter may,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Warn him that he be not afraid to ſee the badneſs of his own heart.</hi> For perſons that have been praying for it, are yet afraid of it when it comes to. It is ſuch a doleful &amp; uncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Spectacle that they cannot bear to behold it; the ſenſe of it is ſo croſs to their pride, and ſtirs up ſuch fears of Damnation, that they cannot tell how to away with it, and labour to hide it from themſelves, and to get ſuch affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions as may comfort them; but they ſhould be told, that there is no cauſe for them to fear to ſee their own hearts, for it is dangerous to be ignorant of them, but not dangerous to ſee them; the ſight of the heart is awful, but not hurtful; the heart is bad whether they ſee it or no, and they muſt ſee it before it be better: The <hi>Chyrurgeon</hi> muſt come to the bottom of the Wound before he heals it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Instruct him, that there is a neceſſity of his ſubmiſſion to God;</hi> for his oppoſition to that has made him to quench thoſe Convictions of the Spirit which he had. He could not bear to yield himſelf a priſoner into the hands of God, and to lie at his foot wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:001716_0071_0FB74CDA576169A0"/>for mercy, and that has put him upon it to deliver himſelf from thoſe Convictions that led that way; but he muſt be inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that there is a neceſſity of ſubmitting himſelf to God; he cannot help himſelf, &amp; God is not bound to help him; God may leave him to periſh if he will, and ſo long as he magnifies himſelf, and refuſes to reſign up himſelf to God, God will not diſcover Chriſt to him; he may pray, but he will not be heard: <hi>God reſists the proud.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SOMETIMES he is <hi>afraid that his Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are not like the Convictions of other men, and he hath ſeveral arguments</hi> to ſtrengthen thoſe fears.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>One Argument</hi> is, that his Convictions are only the <hi>workings of natural Conſcience,</hi> and not from the <hi>Spirit of God:</hi> his Convictions are from the workings of his own thoughts; but he may be told, the way of the Spirits work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when it does convince men, is <hi>by inlightning natural Conſcience;</hi> the Spirit does <hi>not work by giving a testimony,</hi> but by <hi>aſſiſting natural Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> to do its work: Natural Conſcience is the inſtrument in the hand of God to accuſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn, terrifie, and to urge to duty: The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God leads men into the conſideration of their danger, and make them to be affected therewith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.27. <hi>The ſpirit of man is the candle of the Lord, ſearching all the inward parts of the belly.</hi> When men's own hearts are ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:001716_0072_0FB74CDE276A39A8"/>them up to Sin, &amp; they have many reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings about it, that is no ſign that <hi>Satan</hi> is not buſie with them: So when their own hearts are accuſing and frighting of them, it is no ſign that the Spirit of God is not at work with them: All the regular actings of Conſcience, all thoſe Convictions that are <hi>according to the Word of God,</hi> are from the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>Another <hi>Argument</hi> is, that his <hi>terrors are not ſo great as other mens.</hi> Many others have ſuch terrors that they are ſwallowed up therewith, almoſt diſtracted; all the <hi>Town</hi> may take <hi>notice</hi> of it; but his terrors are more moderate by far: But he may be told,</p>
            <p>That there is <hi>great diverſity in the degrees of mens trouble:</hi> Every man muſt have ſo much trouble, as to make him ſtrive earneſtly after Salvation, and do what he can do in order to it; ſo much as to make him thorowly to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,</hi> and <hi>earneſtly to strive</hi> to get into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Condition. Every <hi>Ship</hi> that performs its Voyage, muſt have ſo much Wind as may make the <hi>Ship</hi> Sail; but ſome <hi>Ships</hi> have ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and more tempeſtuous winds than others have. Some men are of more tender ſpirit, &amp; leſs will prevail upon them, than upon others; and ſome men whoſe troubles are but ſmall at the beginning, do grow afterwards to a great height: God uſes his <hi>Sovereignty</hi> very much as to the degree of mens trouble.</p>
            <p>Another <hi>Argument</hi> is, <hi>that his terror did not
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:001716_0073_0FB74CE0531E8418"/>begin when other mens did.</hi> Many others have been ſmitten in the <hi>Preaching of the Word,</hi> the Word of God has been like a <hi>ſharp ſword</hi> in their heart; but his troubles came from the <hi>examples of others,</hi> or from ſome <hi>affliction,</hi> or from his <hi>fall into ſome ſin:</hi> But he may be told,</p>
            <p>That <hi>it is all one from what occaſion his troubles did ariſe, provided that he be but convinced of the abſolute neceſſity of preſent Reconciliation, and be but earnest in his endeavours after that:</hi> Though the Word be a principal means of Converſion, yet God may bleſs what means he will to do the work, <hi>Luke.</hi> 3.10, 12, 14. <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.24. Examples fails, and Afflictions have a great tendency this way. Whatever be the means of mens Reformation, yet if men be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed it is well: God would have men to make uſe of <hi>Providences</hi> as well as <hi>Ordinances,</hi> there is a <hi>voice of God in them, Mic.</hi> 6.9.</p>
            <p>Another <hi>Argument</hi> is, <hi>Becauſe he does not ſee the evil of Sin.</hi> He ſees a great deal of danger, <hi>but he does</hi> not ſee the evil of ſin, he thinks that other men ſee more than he ſees; but he may be told,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That other men do never ſee the great evil of ſin, until they are Converted.</hi> Men may ſee a <hi>moral</hi> evil in ſin, and a great deal of the vanity and folly of it, though they are not under a <hi>prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory</hi> work of the Spirit; but they never come to ſee the great evil of ſin, until they are Converted. Men have not a Spiritual Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:001716_0074_0FB74CE1D1A5AB70"/>given them, till they are Converted; they don't hate ſin, until they are Converted; ſo long as they remain under the preparatory work of the Spirit, no ſuch things can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from them, as are <hi>peculiar to Saints:</hi> When once men come to ſee the evil of ſin, they alſo ſee the Glory of God; they do mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify their ſins, and are brought into a ſtate of Sanctification.</p>
            <p>Another <hi>Argument</hi> is, <hi>Becauſe he don't proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in his ſeekings;</hi> he has been ſeeking a long time, and yet God ſtands at a diſtance from him, other men get thro' it quickly; ſome that began a long time ſince him, have obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>peace with God,</hi> but he is left yet in a deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition: But he may be told,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That it is a common thing with God to Convert ſome in a far ſhorter time than others.</hi> One Ship may ſpend twice as much time as another in performing the ſame Voyage; one mans diſeaſe may be broke in far leſs time than another mans. Some men has more temptations and hindrances than others; the Spirit purſues ſome men more cloſely than others; and thoſe that are longer under the work, may be as ſoundly Converted at laſt. The great reaſon why men do not hitherto proſper in their ſeekings, is not that their firſt troubles were not like the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of other men, but becauſe they <hi>truſt in their own righteouſneſs,</hi> and are not yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:001716_0075_0FB74CE919A9A038"/>of their own helpleſs condition, and the badneſs of their own hearts.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But are not ſome mens Convictions and Terrors Saving? Is there not a difference all along in the terrors of them that are Elect, and them that are Reprobate?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> There <hi>is no difference for a great while between the strivings of the Spirit in thoſe that ſhall be Converted, and in thoſe that ſhall not.</hi> As there may be no difference in the Voyages of two Ships for a pretty while, one of which at laſt arrives in the Harbour, and the other is Caſt-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; So it is here. Thoſe that ſhall never be Converted, may have the ſame experiences for a conſiderable time, that thoſe have that ſhall be Converted; there may be no difference in their <hi>Awakenings,</hi> in their <hi>Reformations,</hi> in their <hi>Temptations,</hi> in their <hi>Encouragments,</hi> nor in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their <hi>Frames.</hi> This does appear,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe thoſe ſtrivings that men may have, that ſhall never be Converted, are ſufficient to bring men forward towards Christ.</hi> There is no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity at all, that the Elect ſhould have any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrivings for a time, than what are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to Reprobates; the Convictions that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates may have, are ſufficient to bring men forward towards Chriſt; thoſe terrors that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates may have, are ſufficient to wean them from the World, to make them reform their lives, and labour to be Converted. If men have but ſuch a ſenſe of Hell as many Reprobates
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:001716_0076_0FB74CEAD5E141E0"/>have had, there is no danger but they will take pains to be ſaved, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.34. Tho' this will not Convert them, yet it will bring them <hi>near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the Kingdom of God,</hi> then they were; it will make them travel towards Chriſt, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome ſeveral impediments that lay in the way of their Converſion; though they don't ſee the great evil of ſin, yet they will be afraid of it; though they don't ſee the excellency of Holineſs, yet they will ſeek after it: Common Convictions are a preparation for Converſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>They that are to be Converted, are not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any ſtrivings of the Spirit, but what are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, till they come to be humbled, and to believe.</hi> It is a pritty while after God begins to ſtrive with the Elect, before they come to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and to believe in Chriſt; and before that, they are not capable of any ſtrivings, but what are common. What can there be, but what is common to other men? Other men have fears of Hell and Judgment <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

               </gap> deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: And what can theſe have more before they are humbled? They are not capable yet to ſee the evil of Sin, the excellency of Chriſt, nor of godly ſorrow, nor of ſincere deſires, becauſe they are not Converted. Why may not a Reprobate have as much Conviction as they? What are they capable
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:001716_0077_0FB74CED91CB1590"/>of in their preſent Circumſtances, but what many have had that are now in Hell? Some ſpeak of a <hi>Saving Conviction, and Contrition;</hi> What is it? if it be only of Hell &amp; Wrath, Reprobates have ſuch as well as they; it can't be the great evil of ſin, for none can ſee that, but they that are Converted: Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural men are blind, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>If there be a difference, men might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to tell what the difference is, and apply it.</hi> There is a difference between <hi>common grace</hi> and <hi>ſaving grace,</hi> and we are able to give an account what it is: So if there were a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Convictions of the Elect and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, we might be able from the Word of God to tell what the difference is; if ordinary men could not do it, yet it might be expected, that ſuch as have a deeper inſight into the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſhould: There God gives us Rules to diſcern the difference that is in his Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but no man in the world is able to tell what Convictions of Wrath and Hell are pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to Elect Sinners, and what are peculiar to Reprobates. Can we diſtinguiſh them by their kinds, by their degree, by their continuance, by their immediate effects? What Rules have we to guide us in this matter? And can we make an application to perſons? If Sinners give us a true account of their terrors, can we tell one that his Convictions are ſuch as are proper to the Elect, and they will end in Converſion;
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:001716_0078_0FB74CEEDD4CCB20"/>and another, that his Convictions are the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of Reprobates, and that they will end in Damnation? This would be a bold Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of any man; the <hi>Scripture</hi> is ſilent about is; yea, the Scripture ſpeaks the contrary, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.52, <hi>them that were entring in ye hindred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SOMETIMES <hi>the man is afraid that he ſhall dye quickly, and lives in a great deal of torment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that account.</hi> He is in anguiſh of ſpirit; this frame riſes either meerly from his ſenſe of Gods anger, he thinks God will preſently pour out his Wrath; or ſometimes beſides this, there is ſomething in Providence that looks that way, or ſome would come to him that makes him fear it; as that, <hi>Set thine houſe in order, for thou ſhalt dye and not live.</hi> In this Caſe he ſhould be told by the Miniſter,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That he ought not to take up ſuch a Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> No man ſhould believe any thing that may be falſe: He has no ſufficient grounds to draw up any ſuch peremptory concluſion, for the thing it ſelf is uncertain; Gods anger does not ſhew it; God has been angry with him a long time, yet he lives; neither do thoſe other ſigns ſhew that it ſhall be; ſuch things have oftentimes failed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That it is not ſo uſual with God to take men away when they are under earneſt endeavours to be Converted.</hi> God threatens Sinners to take them away in the time of their ſecurity: When they ſay <hi>peace, peace,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.48.
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:001716_0079_0FB74CF3D478F398"/>Though ſometimes men do dye that are ſeeking after peace with God, and to all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance have not found; yet this is not an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary diſpenſation. When he is ſtriving by his Spirit to bring them to Repentance, it is an hopeful ſign that God will wait a while upon them; if we knock at a mans door, and they be all faſt and don't ſtir to open the door, we are wont to go away; but if we perceive that they are riſing and preparing to open the door, we are content to wait a-while. God general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtays to ſee what work men will make of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That he has indeed no certainty of his life; his body is mortal and frail, and many men dye ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly.</hi> God has been much provoked by him, and may juſtly ſnatch him away by a ſudden ſtroke. Many times men have very little war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Death, the fear of death is of great uſe to forward the work of Converſion: If men <hi>put far away the evil day,</hi> they thereby harden their hearts; <hi>the right numbring of their days,</hi> is a means to make them <hi>apply their hearts to wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Pſal.</hi> 90.12. Upon this account it is good to nouriſh awful fears of death; that makes men ſenſible of the vanity of the World, of the dangerouſneſs of Sin of the neceſſity of making haſte to be Converted: therefore Miniſters ſhould ſay nothing to perſwade them, that they are in no danger, for they are in real danger, and it is beſt for them to have the ſenſe of it; this will ſolemnize their ſpirits, and quicken
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:001716_0080_0FB74CFB0F529F68"/>them to their work; when afraid of Death, they will be willing to take pains, and not be hindred by temptations.</p>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>That it is generally ſo with men under the work of preparation.</hi> There's ſcarce any but has experience of it. Men can hardly bear out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward afflictions, much leſs appearances of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: When awakened Sinners are called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>ſubmit to God,</hi> yield themſelves priſoners to him, there are <hi>two courſes</hi> that men take to avoid it; <hi>One</hi> is, <hi>to eſtabliſh a righteouſneſs of their own;</hi> they ſtrive to pacify the anger of God, they would fain do ſomething to ingage the heart of God to ſave them.

<pb n="63" facs="unknown:001716_0082_0FB74CFF00A74068"/>the Decree is no excuſe for Sin: Men don't accept it when any wrong is done unto them, neither will God accept it as an excuſe; men act their own pleaſure and diſpoſitions when they ſin: The neceſſity riſing from the Decree, don't take away the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of good actions, nor the blameable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of bad actions; this neceſſity don't cut off all rewards and puniſhments.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That in this Decree, God does but uſe his Sovereign Liberty.</hi> If God will make a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> muſt he be bound to bring them all to <hi>Eternal Life?</hi> Who ſhall lay a prohibition upon God, that he ſhall not make uſe of ſome of them for the <hi>Glory of his Juſtice?</hi> If it be injurious for God to Decree that men ſhall ſin, and then puniſh them for their ſin, then he is utterly cut off from all opportunity for the glorifying of his Juſtice; but it is worth the while for Men and Angels to ſuffer for the manifeſtation of Gods <hi>Vindictive Juſtice.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>That this was a fair and probable way for the good of Mankind;</hi> it was as hopeful a way as for every man to ſtand for <hi>himſelf:</hi> There was leſs likelihood that all <hi>Adams</hi> Poſterity ſhould ſtand, then that he ſhould ſtand; not only from the perſonal qualifications of <hi>Adam,</hi> which were certainly greater than his Poſterity would have had in the time of their Childhood; but becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> was under an exceeding great Bond, he had a great Charge upon him; the Happineſs of all his Poſterity having a great dependance upon his Carriage. <hi>Adam</hi> had not only the care of his own Soul upon him, but he ſtood intruſted for many Millions that were to diſcend from him; and it was proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that that Conſideration ſhould make him more careful to keep Gods <hi>Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. If the man OBJECTS againſt the <hi>Severity of Gods Law,</hi> that puniſhes men with <hi>Everlasting Damnation.</hi> He may be told,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That it is very meet that he ſhould appoint ſuch a puniſhment, as might be a great reſtraint to mans ſinning.</hi> If God had appointed ſome little puniſhment, men would have been more bold
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:001716_0084_0FB74D02D449D518"/>to break the Law of God. Experience ſhews, that this ſevere puniſhment is not ſufficient to keep multitudes from living in a way of ſin; if the puniſhment had been leſs, men would have regarded it but little.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It was very meet that God ſhould appoint a puniſhment that was ſuitable for the vindication of his Name.</hi> God loves himſelf, and his Name is dear to him; and it becomes God to annex ſuch a penalty to his Law, as that his <hi>Great Name</hi> might be vindicated: God is a Great God, and therefore Sin is a <hi>great Evil;</hi> and it is very fit that if ſin be puniſhed, there be a puniſhment appointed ſome ways proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the great evil of Sin.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That by Gods appointing ſo dreadful a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, he makes no man miſerable.</hi> God holds out the point of a ſword, this will do them no hurt if they don't run againſt it: God makes a dreadful pit, this will hurt no man if he don't run into it: <hi>Gods Law makes no man miſerable;</hi> they make themſelves miſerable, and are <hi>cruel to their own Souls,</hi> when they ſin againſt him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The puniſhment appointed for ſin, is no greater than the recompence of Obedience.</hi> There is an <hi>equality</hi> in the Law, the Law is as bountiful to the Obedient, as ſevere to the Diſobedient: If the Law did appoint little rewards of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and great puniſhments of Diſobedience, men would have more ſhew for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, but the reward is as great as the
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:001716_0085_0FB74D0B6B7D4D00"/>puniſhment. Heaven is as good, as Hell is bad.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If he OBJECTS, That <hi>God has ſhewed mercy to others that have not taken ſo much pains as he:</hi> God pardons others, and gives grace to others, but denies him. He may be told.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That his Labour and Service does lay no bond upon God to ſhew mercy to him.</hi> Whatever he has pretended in his Prayers, he has no true regard to the Glory of God, he has minded nothing higher than his own Salvation; he has been ſerving himſelf, and not God. God is no ways obliged to give him ſuch a reward, he has not merited grace, but has merited Condemnation by ſuch ſervices: There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in ſuch ſervices to work upon the mercy of God; God's mercy is not moved by any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal thing, there is nothing in thoſe Services to ingage the <hi>Juſtice of God,</hi> they are far from being meritorious; there is nothing to engage the <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> of God: God has made no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute promiſes to any hypocritical prayers.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That God has a liberty to bestow his Grace upon whom he will.</hi> Mercy is Gods own, and he will make choice who ſhall be the ſubjects of it. God is maſter of his own gifts, will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow them upon one, and deny them to others. It is juſt for God to deny all Sinners Saving Mercy, but if he pleaſes to have mercy upon ſome, none may preſcribe who they ſhall be; but he may chuſe one, and refuſe another, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="67" facs="unknown:001716_0086_0FB74D0C97E4F950"/>
3. <hi>That God never did bestow ſaving mercy upon any Sinner, while he quarrelled againſt his proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Before ever others had mercy, their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits were brought down, and they were bro't to juſtifie God, and <hi>lie at his foot;</hi> if they had ſtood it out as he does, they ſhould have gone without ſaving mercy, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.23. <hi>To me every knee ſhall bow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. If he OBJECTS that <hi>he has done what he can,</hi> and yet God denies Grace to him. He ſhould not think much of it, if he gave way to a ſluggiſh ſpirit, and carried himſelf viciouſly, but he does what he can, and what would God have more. He may be told,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That if he does what he can, he may not chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge mercy from thence.</hi> By what Law will he demand ſaving grace becauſe of that? That does not in its own nature take away Gods <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> and his <hi>Soveraignty:</hi> there is no wrong done him, if God ſees cauſe to deny him; neither is there any <hi>promiſe</hi> whereby God has obliged himſelf to thoſe that do all they can; God has left it in his own liberty to deny them, if he pleaſes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That he doth not what he can.</hi> It may be he is otherwiſe very faulty, but however he don't do what he can, becauſe he does not own <hi>the Sovereignty of God;</hi> he don't juſtifie God, nor acknowledge that God may juſtly reject him after all. Indeed he can't do this without help from God, ſo he can't pray and reform,
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:001716_0087_0FB74D0F74049AC8"/>without aſſiſtance: Yet this is a thing that he can do, principles of nature may produce this effect; many natural men have come to this; men that have no natural principle have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned up themſelves to God, <hi>their mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ths have been ſtopped,</hi> and they have <hi>become guilty before God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. If he OBJECTS that God <hi>requires him to believe, whereas it is not in his power; he is dead in ſin,</hi> and yet God binds him to believe, and calls on him to believe; this ſeems very hard and ſtrange. He may be told,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That though he has <hi>lost his power to obey, yet God has not lost his power to Command.</hi> If he has loſt his ſtrength, yet God has not loſt his Authority: If a Servant make himſelf drunk, and be not able to do his Maſters Buſineſs, that is no excuſe. God gave man power at firſt, and his prodigality don't deliver him from Gods Authority.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That in this way God is pleaſed many times to work Faith.</hi> Men are able to do many things in order to beliveing, and hereby they are put upon it to prepare for that; and in that way many have faith wrought in them. There have multitudes by the Bleſſing of God on the Preaching of the Goſpel been brought to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>SOMETIMES the man ſays, <hi>he is afraid to do any thing in Religion; for whatever he does he is ready to trust to it:</hi> if he <hi>Prays, Fasts,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:001716_0088_0FB74D105DD5F468"/>Reads,</hi> eſpecially when he does thoſe things with any <hi>affection;</hi> ſo he truſts in his <hi>Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs.</hi> In this Caſe he may be told,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That he will not neglect his duty by any means.</hi> He muſt be ſure to attend his duty whatever ill uſe his heart be ready to make of it; he muſt not ſcare himſelf from his duty, becauſe he is ready to truſt in it: Duty muſt be done, Gods Command muſt be attended, whatever be the conſequence of it. Men may not take upon them to judge when it is beſt to attend Gods Command, and when it is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and ſo give themſelves a diſpenſation from their duty; as men <hi>muſt not do evil that good may come of it;</hi> ſo they may not neglect good, leſt evil come of that: Men muſt do their duty, and run the adventure of their hearts making a bad uſe thereof.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That there is no neceſſity of mens truſting to what they do.</hi> If God do but open their eyes, to ſee the plague of their own heart, they will not truſt to what they do. When men are thorowly convinced of the abominations that are in their hearts, and ſee the hypocriſie and formality of their duties, it is impoſſible that they ſhould truſt in them: their confidence in their duties riſes from the opinion that they have of them, and when they come to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the wretchedneſs of them, their heart will not gather conſidence, but fear from them; and therefore it is their duty to ſtudy their
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:001716_0089_0FB74D14F5DB3B40"/>own hearts, and labour to find out the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of them.</p>
            <p>When the man is told that there is <hi>a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſeeing his own heart,</hi> in order to his <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation.</hi> Sometimes he <hi>Objects,</hi> that he is <hi>blind</hi> and can't ſee; how can a blind man ſee his own hearts. He may be told,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That he is indeed ſpiritually blind, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he cannot ſee the evil of Sin;</hi> that is not to be ſeen, till men have received a Spiritual Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding from God; and accordingly there is no neceſſity of ſeeing that in order to his Humiliation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>But yet he is capable to have an experimental ſight of the badneſs of his own heart.</hi> Natural Conſcience is able to diſcern that: Men may find by experience, that they are under the power of pride, of diſcontent, and carnal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; and that they are utterly deſtitute of love to God, or any gracious diſpoſition; theſe things are not diſcerned by a ſpiritual eye, but by a natural eye: Natural men may obſerve and diſcern the workings of their own hearts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.8. <hi>Sin taking occaſion by the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wrought in me all manner of Concupiſcence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SOMETIMES the man ſays, <hi>he is willing to believe in Chriſt, but finds himſelf unable; he could be glad he could believe, but it is beyond him.</hi> In this Caſe he may be told,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That there is a mighty oppoſition in the heart of a natural man to believing in Chriſt; as it is
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:001716_0090_0FB74D190EEEC100"/>with all other Spiritual Duties,</hi> ſo it is with this. Men don't love to believe in Chriſt, but have a contrariety thereunto, <hi>Jeh.</hi> 5.40. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.37. The oppoſition riſes <hi>partly</hi> from <hi>pride,</hi> they had rather be ſaved by their own works, that they may have <hi>ſomewhat to glory in;</hi> it is very croſs to their haughty ſpirit to go out of themſelves, and be beholden to Chriſt alone for Salvation, to have nothing of their own to glory in; Men don't love to ſee themſelves nothing; and <hi>partly</hi> it riſes from <hi>fear:</hi> it ſeems to them a terrible thing to adventure upon Chriſt, they are not certain that God is free to accept of them; they are not certain whether Chriſt's Righteouſneſs be ſufficient for them; they don't ſee the incouragement that is in the <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> &amp; think it an unlikely thing that they ſhall be ſafe in ſuch a way: hence they have a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in their heart; look upon it too great an adventure, they fear it will be loked upon to be preſumption, and that inſtead of mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their condition, they ſhall make it worſe, they ſhould be afraid to ſtay away from Chriſt; but they are afraid to come to him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are not willing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>If the man were willing, what keeps him from Chriſt?</hi> The difficulty lies in the <hi>will,</hi> if the <hi>will</hi> be conquered, the man is conquered: Yea, <hi>Faith in Chriſt</hi> is an <hi>act of the will:</hi> Faith is a chuſing of Chriſt for his Saviour. Chriſt is offered to men, and many incouragements are
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:001716_0091_0FB74D1AE90E1220"/>preſented before them; and when once the will is gained to accept the offer, the man does believe on Chriſt: If men were willing, the difficulty would be at an end; they can't be willing till they are able; they are not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, until the will is ſtrengthened to comply with Gods Call.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That ſeeming willingneſs that is in many men is but feigned.</hi> They pretend a willingneſs to quiet their Conſciences; they don't it may be feel much oppoſition, but they are not indeed willing; they are willing to be ſaved, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be ſaved by Chriſt, rather than not be ſaved at all; and have ſome ſelfiſh deſires that they could come to Chriſt, but there is no ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in them.</p>
            <p>SOMETIMES the man ſays, that <hi>he would fain ſubmit to the will of God, but can't tell how;</hi> he has been ſtriving after it a great while, but cannot attain it. In this Caſe he may be told,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Natural men do never ſincerely ſtrive af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſubmiſſion to God;</hi> they do ſtrive to ſubmit after a faſhion, and pray that they may, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they hear that it is neceſſary in order to Converſion, but they are never ſincere in it; they do it in a falſe and deceitful way: Which appears,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe they are <hi>labouring to make their hearts better.</hi> They are labouring to mend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and upon this account they labour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, that they may be neceſſitated to ſubmit
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:001716_0092_0FB74D2137EB0870"/>to the will of God; that their own goodneſs may be a bond upon God to ſave them, that it may not be in the free liberty of God to do what he pleaſes with them: And upon this account they ſtrive to ſubmit to God, that they make a Righteouſneſs of that.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe at the ſame time <hi>they are hiding their own hearts from themſelves; they are afraid to ſee how bad they are.</hi> If they have any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of their own badneſs, they will ſtifle them if they can: they are labouring to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe themſelves, and love to look upon any thing in themſelves that ſeems like goodneſs; they are perſwading of themſelves that they are better than they are, which are great hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances to Submiſſion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Becauſe they are not thorowly convinced of a neceſſity of ſubmiſſion to God.</hi> If they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of a neceſſity of it, they would do it; and if they be not convinced of it, they can't ſtrive ſincerely after it: as long as men hope that they may make a ſhift without it, they will not heartily ſeek after it: As long as they hope that their own righteouſneſs will lay a bond up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, and that it is not fair for God to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them, they will not heartily endeavour after ſubmiſſion.</p>
            <p>When men are called upon to ſubmit to God, <hi>and reſign up themſelves to his Sovereignty, they ſay they do ſo;</hi> they can't help themſelves, but muſt juſtifie God. In this Caſe there is
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:001716_0093_0FB74D23D67C3DA8"/>great need to examine, whether their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion be of the right kind; for there is a ſhew of ſubmiſſion, which is not real <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation:</hi> and there are theſe <hi>ſigns</hi> of a <hi>falſe Submiſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>When it is the fruit of their own ſtrivings.</hi> Men hear that they muſt ſubmit themſelves to God, before they obtain mercy; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly they ſtrive for it, and work up a kind of image of ſubmiſſion to God: they bring themſelves to own <hi>that they are in Gods hands,</hi> and he may do what he will with them, this is never right. When men are brought to ſubmit to God indeed, the thing is <hi>forced by the power of Conviction:</hi> they ſtrive againſt it, but never ſo evidently convinced of the inſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of themſelves, and the Juſtice of God, that they had no other way left them, but to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of God; as it was with thoſe <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 7.4.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>When men make a righteouſneſs of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</hi> When men have got a falſe ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they are wont to be proud of that, and to think that God will be taken with them: they look upon it a choice frame of ſpirit, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in it as a thing pleaſing to God; but when men do indeed ſubmit to God, they ſee nothing in it to be proud of; they ſee themſelves <hi>all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver defiled like Lepers;</hi> empty of all good, and look upon this ſubmiſſion as having nothing at all of goodneſs in it; they ſee they are meerly
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:001716_0094_0FB74D25614B1628"/>forced to it: That they have no other way to take, but to fall into the hands of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>When, notwithſtanding their ſubmiſſion, they are ſtill ſtriving to make their hearts better.</hi> If you ask them whether they are ſtriving to love God, and to do duties for his Glory? They ſay yes, they are labouring after it; you may be ſure they don't ſubmit to God, but are la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to get ſome goodneſs of their own to commend them to God; they are not ſenſible of their own impotency. But if a man do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſubmit to God, he ſees himſelf <hi>dead in treſpaſſes and ſins;</hi> ask him whether he be ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to make his heart better; he will ſay he can as eaſily remove a mountain as do it; that he has been ſtriving after it a great while, but now he finds that he has no power; his heart is as dead as a ſtone, there is no diſpoſition to any thing that is good in him, it is quite out of his reach; if God don't make him better, it will never be effected.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>When men ſay they have been brought to that many a time.</hi> When ſome men are enquired of, whether they were brought to ſubmit to God's Sovereignty? Yes, they ſay many a time. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in trouble of Conſcience ſay it has been ſo oftentimes with them; this ſhews it is not a right ſubmiſſion. <hi>Godly men</hi> after their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, may <hi>ſubmit many times</hi> to God, but that ſubmiſſion differs much from this; that is a <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſubmiſſion,</hi> and they don't ſee at the ſame time themſelves utterly deſtitute of all grace; but that ſubmiſſion that goes before the cloſing with Chriſt, is never wrought any more than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; when it's wrought it may continue ſome
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:001716_0095_0FB74D27906C48E0"/>little time, till God reveals Chriſt to a man; but this work is never wrought over and over again in the Soul.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>When men are afraid they are not humbled e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</hi> Some men that do pretend to ſubmiſſion, are afraid that they are not humbled enough, and they wiſh they may be humbled more; this makes it evident that they do not indeed ſubmit, it is a ſign that they make a righteouſneſs of their ſubmiſſion. When men do indeed ſubmit to God, they are never exerciſed with any ſuch ſcruples, becauſe they don't look upon their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion as a thing that commends them to God. When a man ſubmits, he <hi>abſolutely reſigns up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> as a priſoner to God, is wholly <hi>broken off from his own righteouſneſs and ſufficiency,</hi> and leaves himſelf with God, and does not do it under a notion that there is any excellency in it, but out of neceſſity leaves himſelf with God.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>When men ſubmit to God as looking upon him not very angry.</hi> Some Sinners ſubmit to God, and at the ſame time they think they have ſome love to God, and ſome care of his Glory; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly they look upon their peace half made; tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this is no difficult matter; it is eaſie for a man to put his life into the hands of his friend: there is no great oppoſition to ſubmit to God, when a man is pretty confident that God <hi>will ſave him;</hi> but it is another thing to ſubmit to God, when a man does not ſee a ſpark of goodneſs in himſelf, when he looks upon God as bitterly angry with him, and is much afraid that God will utterly deſtroy him: When men ſubmit under ſuch circumſtances, it is evident that God has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered them, and that their Wills are broken.</p>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>If upon Enquiry the Caſe be more doubtful, as it may be, partly becauſe ſome things were not ſo clear to himſelf, or becauſe he has forgotten ſome material thing, and cannot ſpeak to it.</hi> It may be well to tell him, That if it be right, he will <hi>ſee more of it;</hi> when God begins to make a diſcovery of Chriſt, he will not leave men' but is wont to ſhew them more. <hi>The path of the juſt is like the morning light,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>If the Caſe be plain, it is beſt to encourage him, tho' there is no need to be poſitive.</hi> But he may be told, That <hi>it is hopeful that God has drawn his heart to Chriſt, and made a gracious change in his Soul;</hi> and that if he does indeed believe on Chriſt, he ſhall certainly be
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:001716_0108_0FB74BF118D78710"/>ſaved; his ſin don't make ſuch a breach between God and him, as to hazard his Salvation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>To warn him to depend ſtill on the free Grace of God in Chriſt;</hi> he muſt expect many dark hours and times of temptation, but his way muſt be, <hi>to grow in the knowledge of Chriſt;</hi> he muſt not think, that now he ſhall always live a life of joy and comfort.

            </p>
            <p>There be TWO particular CASES that do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a particular Conſideration.</p>
            <p>The Frſt CASE is, <hi>When the Miniſter is ſent for by a man upon his Sick-bed.</hi> The firſt thing to be done is to <hi>get an underſtanding in what condition the perſon is.</hi> For though a man that does not know his Caſe may ſpeak ſeveral things that may be ſafe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable: whatever his Condition is; yet the more knowledge there is of the ſtate of the man, the more <hi>advantage</hi> he is under to ſpeak pertinently.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I.</hi> If it be plain that the man is in a <hi>Natoral Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> it is moſt proper to inſiſt upon theſe three things:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That he has a preſent abſolute neceſſity to be at peace with God:</hi> that if he ſhould dye in a Natural Condition, he will be for ever undone: It is very fit he
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:001716_0109_0FB74BF454938848"/>ſhould be rememored of his ſinful life, and the dreadfulneſs of that puniſhment that hangs over his head; which may be ſet before him in an affecting manner, that if it be poſſible he may be terrified, and made ſenſible of thoſe Eternal Miſeries that are coming upon him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That he may not reſt in any thing ſhort of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n in ſuch a Caſe are like a man drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ready to catch hold of any thing that comes near; they are ready to have a dependance upon their Priviledges, upon their Parentage, upon their ſorrow for their miſpent life and upon their purpoſes to live better if God do raiſe them up again; he muſt be led into an underſtanding of the <hi>ſtrictneſs of the Law of God</hi> and the <hi>vanity of all ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>l confidences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That there is a glorious way of Life prepared by Chriſt</hi> Chriſt Jeſus has fulfilled the Law, &amp; wrought out Eternal Salvation for us, that the <hi>Gift of God is Eternal Life;</hi> and that the mercy of God is free, and God does not refuſe any that do hearken to the Call of the Goſpel, that God will as readily receive him if he comes to Chriſt, as if he were likely to live many years, and do ſervice to God in the World.</p>
            <p>And if his particular temptations may be diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, care muſt be taken to remove them; if he be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any <hi>ſpecial diſcouragement</hi> or any <hi>flattering deluſion,</hi> the ſnare if it be poſſible muſt be broken; he muſt be ſhewed the <hi>vanity of that temptation.</hi> Such light muſt be held out, that if God will bleſs it he may be delivered.</p>
            <p>If at that time, or any other afterwards he does <hi>pretend to believe in Chriſt,</hi> it is very meet that he be <hi>cautioned</hi> that he does not <hi>deceive himſelf; for ſick-bed Repensances are ſeldom true.</hi> Many perſons that made great pretenſions when ſick, have proved very badly after their recovery.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>II.</hi> If it be doubtful whether the man be in a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Condition, or Converted, as there may be ſome occuſion to hope becauſe of his profeſſion, becauſe of
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:001716_0110_0FB74BF6A95B7E70"/>his eſtimation among men; becauſe of an orderly carriage, and yet occaſion to fear, becauſe there is no great evidence of Grace, either in his Converſation before, or diſcourſe at preſent: Sometimes there is more grounds for hope, ſometimes for fear. Theſe three things may ſafely be ſpoken to him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Doctrine of the Law and Goſpel may be ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</hi> They may be ſomewhat explained and cleared up: It is fit men ſhould be remembred of the Rule they are to be judged by. Many times when the Rule is clearly laid down. Conſcience makes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and witneſſes to men how it is with them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. <hi>The Word of God is quick and powerful, ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per than any two-edged ſword,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Promiſes may be applied conditionally.</hi> He may be told, That if he have been thorowly broken off from himſelf, and brought to rely upon Chriſt, God has accepted of him; that if his heart have been drawn by Goſpel Encouragements to rely on Chriſt, he is out of danger; that if Gods Glory be upon his heart indeed, he is an heir of Glory; he may be told, that only his own Conſcience can tell what the workings of his heart have been: That if he be not miſtaken, but has <hi>indeed made Chriſt his refuge, all his ſins are pardoned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>He may be warned that he do not deceive himſelf.</hi> It may be meet to remember him, that the <hi>heart is deceitful;</hi> that many falſe hearts do go hoping out of the World, that there be ſeveral things that do <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble</hi> Faith, and every Grace may be counterfeited: That he had need to <hi>beg of God</hi> to diſcover things plainly to him: That it would be a dreadful thing to be miſtaken; and ſo he may be charged that he do not truſt in any thing in himſelf, <hi>but betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alone to Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>III.</hi> If it be conſiderably plain, that he is <hi>Converted and Gracious;</hi> either from his known eminency in Religion, or from an account that he gives of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, or diſcoveries of Chriſt, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious workings of his heart: It may be very meet,
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:001716_0111_0FB74BF913240258"/>To <hi>comfort him</hi> with thoſe <hi>great and precious promiſes</hi> that God has made, to remember him of the freeneſs of Gods Grace, and the preciouſneſs of the Blood of Chriſt; he may be minded of thoſe things that are the pillars of our Faith, and the foundations of our comfort; how God in all Ages of the World has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed this way of Salvation in this way the Saints of Old have lived and dyed: How the <hi>Faithfulneſs of God</hi> ſtands engaged for their Salvation, that their ſins and iniquities <hi>are caſt behind Gods back;</hi> this muſt be underſtood or ſpoken upon a ſuppoſition, that their work is a thorow work.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Caſe</hi> he deſires the <hi>Minister</hi> to tell <hi>what he judges about his ſincerity;</hi> it may be ſuitable to tell him, that as far as he can diſcern, his heart is upright, and that the root of the matter is found in him; he muſt tell him that he has no infallible knowledge, God alone does know the hearts of men, there is no depending on his judgment, but ſo far as he can perceive, his Soul has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed by the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>If the man has any <hi>particular temptations,</hi> it is very ſuitable to remove them; he may be under temptation, becauſe he has great deadneſs, a great deal of pride and hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie; becauſe he has not had ſo much dſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the favour of God, as he perceives others have had; becauſe many others have been miſtaken; becauſe God has afflicted him very much; becauſe he is withdrawn now in the time of his Sickneſs: Such particular <hi>temptations</hi> are to be <hi>anſwered.</hi> It may be
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:001716_0112_0FB74BFA26E15A98"/>ſhewed to him, that the dealings of God are various with his people; that ſuch things are not inconſiſtent with Grace, that the beſt way is <hi>to live upon the free mercy of God in Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The OTHER CASE is, <hi>when ſuch perſons as have made an high profeſſion of Religion for a long while, are in darkneſs</hi> about their Condition.</p>
            <p>In this <hi>Caſe,</hi> the firſt care of the Miniſter muſt be, <hi>to get ſatisfaction concerning the state of the perſon,</hi> whether he be <hi>Regenerate</hi> or <hi>not.</hi> Not but that many things may be ſpoken that may be profitable to them, whether they be ſincerely Godly or no: But if the Miniſter do not know their condition, he can't apply <hi>proper remedies;</hi> and he may ſpeak that which may be very dangerous, if he ſuppoſes the man to be Unconverted, when he is Convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; he may torment him, and diſcourage him needleſly; if he ſuppoſes the man Converted when he is not, he may do him much damage by comforting him up in a falſe way; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is very needful that he do get what ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction he can about their condition, that ſo he may be helpful to them in their diſtreſſes.</p>
            <p>In order to his paſſing a right judgment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their condition, he muſt be <hi>careful that he do not lay too much weight upon it,</hi> that they have been in <hi>Church-fellowſhip</hi> many years, that their <hi>Carriage has been orderly,</hi> that they are <hi>well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of where they live,</hi> for theſe are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>fallible ſigns,</hi> ſuch things are common to <hi>Saints</hi>
               <pb n="94" facs="unknown:001716_0113_0FB74BFBECD737B0"/>and <hi>Hypocrites;</hi> though theſe things may be <hi>grounds of Charity;</hi> but a Miniſter had need have better grounds to go upon when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts up perſons with <hi>hopes of Reconciliation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither muſt he lay too much weight on <hi>bad ſigns,</hi> that are <hi>not demonſtrative;</hi> if the man do not know the time of his Converſion, or firſt cloſing with Chriſt, if he have any notable blemiſh, if he be not well accounted of, the Miniſter may not draw any peremptory con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion from thence that he is not Godly; yea, if he do judge himſelf confidently to be Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, it is beſt to enquire ſomewhat further in it. It is beſt diſcovered by three ſorts of <hi>Enquiries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Whether they have paſſed thorow the ſeveral ſteps of the work of Converſion.</hi> Some can give ſo full an account thereof, as will abundantly ſatisfie the Miniſter, that the work is right; ſome are ſo ſtrangely to ſeek, that he may be much confirmed, that they have no grace; in ſome others after they have given what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count they can, the work is more dubious.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Whether they have lived a life of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> There is great diverſity in the meaſures of Sanctification that men have attained unto: very Holy men live an holy life, and by En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring what knowledge they have of God? Whether they prize the Glory of God? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they hate all Sin? Whether they do draw their encouragement from Chriſt? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:001716_0114_0FB74BFD62222CA8"/>they love Holineſs, for Holineſs ſake? What Conflict they have with Pride, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, a ſelf-righteous Spirit and Self-love? A Miniſter may come to comptent ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whether they be in a ſtate of Grace or not; in diſcourſing ſuch things with them, a man may many times feel the workings of a ſpirit of Holineſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Whether they have had ſenſible Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God.</hi> God is wont at times to draw nigh to the Souls of his People, ſometimes in <hi>Meditation,</hi> ſometimes in <hi>Prayer,</hi> and in other <hi>Ordinances;</hi> and to make diſcoveries of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and of Jeſus Chriſt to their Souls, and to draw their hearts to him; and if there has been any thing conſiderable that way; the Miniſter may be well ſatisfied of their good Eſtate.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Caſe</hi> the Miniſter be ſatisfied that the man is not <hi>Converted,</hi> he muſt uſe his prudence to judge whether it will be for the mans profit, that he do in plain Terms tell him ſo; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it may be a prejudice and a means to exaſperate him. Sometimes there is no ſuch danger, but he may freely tell him what he judges, and the reaſons of his jugment.</p>
            <p>But in caſe he do not ſee it his way to tell the man his thoughts concerning him, yet he ought in conſcience in the wiſeſt way he can, <hi>put him into the understanding of his own condition:</hi> He may not ſuffer the
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:001716_0115_0FB74C0160459CA8"/>man to go away with an opinion, that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inks well of him, much leſs may he leave him ignorant of ſuch rules whereby he may come to underſtand his condition; it becomes him to lay ſuch <hi>ſigns of tryal</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him as are moſt likely to bring him to ſight of himſelf, and convince him of his <hi>Dangerous Estate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In caſe the Miniſter be ſatisfied on good grounds about the <hi>mans good Estate:</hi> He ought to endeavour to <hi>clear it up to the man,</hi> laying convincing light before him; and anſwering thoſe <hi>temptations</hi> that make it doubtful to the man himſelf; and alſo to direct him in ſuch ways, wherein it is hopeful that God will help him and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him from his Temptations.</p>
