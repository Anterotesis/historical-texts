            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE</head>
            <p>A Simplicity in diet, whether it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered with reference to the happineſs of individuals or the proſperity of a nation, is of more conſequence than we are apt to imagine. In recomending ſo important an object to the rational part of mankind, I wiſh it were in my power to do it in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as would be likely to gain their attention. I am ſenſible that it is one of thoſe ſubjects in which example has infinitely more power than the moſt convincing arguments or the higheſt charms of poetry. Goldſmith's DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SERTED VILLAGE, though poſſeſſing theſe two advantages in a greater degree than any other work of the kind, has not prevented villages in England from being deſerted. The apparent intereſt of the rich individuals, who
<pb facs="unknown:030023_0003_0FE3C6A8F9DC1E58"/>
form the taſte as well as the laws in that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, has been againſt him; and with that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt it has been vain to contend.</p>
            <p>The vicious habits which in this little piece I endeavour to combat, ſeem to me not ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to cure. No claſs of people has any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in ſupporting them; unleſs it be the intereſt which certain families may feel in vying with each other in ſumptuous enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments. There may indeed be ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of depraved appetites, which no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will conquer; but theſe muſt be rare. There are very few perſons but what would always prefer a plain diſh for themſelves, and would prefer it likewiſe for their gueſts, if there were no riſk of reputation in the caſe. This difficulty can only be removed by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and the example ſhould proceed from thoſe whoſe ſituation enables them to take the lead in forming the manners of a nation. Perſons of this deſcription in America, I ſhould hope, are neither above nor below
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:030023_0004_0FE3C6AE447B2010"/>
the influence of truth and reaſon, when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed in language ſuited to the ſubject.</p>
            <p>Whether the manner I have choſen to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs my argments to them be ſuch as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe any ſucceſs is what I cannot decide<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but I certainly had hopes of doing ſome good, or I ſhould not have taken the pains of putting ſo many rhymes together—The example of domeſtic virtues has doubtleſs a great effect. I only wiſh to rank SIMPLICITY of DIET a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the virtues. In that caſe I ſhould hope it will be cheriſhed and more eſteemed by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers than it is at preſent.</p>

               <l>Long o'er the ſimmering fire ſhe lets it ſtand;</l>
               <l>To ſtir it well demands a ſtronger hand?</l>
               <l>The huſband takes his turn; and round and round</l>
               <l>The ladle flies; at laſt the toil is crown'd;</l>
               <l>When to the board the thronging huſkers pour,</l>
               <l>And take their ſeats as at the corn before.</l>
               <l>I leave them to their feaſt. There ſtill belong</l>
               <l>More copious matters to my faithful ſong.</l>
               <l>For rules there are, tho' ne'er unfolded yet,</l>
               <l>Nice rules and wiſe, how pudding ſhould be ate.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="20" facs="unknown:030023_0019_0FE3C6EF1029B5E8"/>Some with molaſſes line the luſcious treat,</l>
               <l>And mix, like Bards, the uſeful with the ſweet.</l>
               <l>A wholeſome diſh, and well deſerving praiſe,</l>
               <l>A great reſource in thoſe bleak wint'ry days,</l>
               <l>When the chill'd earth lies buried deep in ſnow,</l>
               <l>And raging Boreas dries the ſhivering cow.</l>
               <l>Bleſt cow! thy praiſe ſhall ſtill my notes employ,</l>
               <l>Great ſource of health, the only ſource of joy;</l>
               <l>Mother of Egypt's God,—but ſure, for me,</l>
               <l>Were I to leave my God, I'd worſhip thee.</l>
               <l>How oft thy teats theſe pious hands have preſt!</l>
               <l>How oft thy bounties prove'd my only feaſt!</l>
               <l>How oft I've fed thee with my fav'rite grain!</l>
               <l>And roar'd like thee, to find thy children ſlain!</l>
               <l>Ye ſwains who know her various worth to prize,</l>
               <l>Ah! houſe her well from Winter's angry ſkies.</l>
               <l>Potatoes, pumpkins, ſhould her ſadneſs cheer,</l>
               <l>Corn from your crib, and maſhes from your beer;</l>
               <l>When Spring returns ſhe'll well acquit the loan,</l>
               <l>And nurſe at once your infants and her own.</l>
               <l>Milk then with pudding I ſhould always chuſe</l>
               <l>To this in future I confine my Muſe,</l>
               <l>Till ſhe in haſte ſome farther hints unfold,</l>
               <l>Well for the young, nor uſeleſs to the old.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:030023_0020_0FE3C6F45886EE40"/>Firſt in your bowl the milk abundant take,</l>
               <l>Then drop with care along the ſilver lake</l>
               <l>Your flakes of pudding; theſe at firſt will hide</l>
               <l>Their little bulk beneath the ſwelling tide;</l>
               <l>But when their growing maſs no more can ſink,</l>
               <l>When the ſoft iſland looms above the brink,</l>
               <l>Then check your hand; you've got the portion due,</l>
               <l>So taught our ſires, and what they taught is true.</l>
               <l>There is a choice in ſpoons. Tho' ſmall appear</l>
               <l>The nice diſtinction, yet to me 'tis clear.</l>
               <l>The deep bowl'd Gallic ſpoon contriv'd to ſcoop</l>
               <l>In ample draughts the thin diluted ſoup,</l>
               <l>Performs not well in thoſe ſubſtantial things,</l>
               <l>Whoſe maſs adheſive to the metal clings;</l>
               <l>Where the ſtrong labial muſcles muſt embrace.</l>
               <l>The gentle curve, and ſweep the hollow ſpace</l>
               <l>With eaſe to enter and diſcharge the freight,</l>
               <l>A bowl leſs concave but ſtill more dilate,</l>
               <l>Becomes the pudding beſt. The ſhape, the ſize,</l>
               <l>A ſecret reſt unknown to vulgar eyes.</l>
               <l>Experienc'd feeders can alone impart</l>
               <l>A rule ſo much above the lore of art.</l>
               <l>Theſe tuneful lips, that thouſand ſpoons have tried,</l>
               <l>With juſt preciſion could the point decide,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="22" facs="unknown:030023_0021_0FE3C6F8EA1E6CC8"/>Tho' not in ſong; the muſe but poorly ſhines</l>
               <l>In cones, and cubes, and geometric lines.</l>
               <l>Yet the true form, as near as ſhe can tell,</l>
               <l>Is that ſmall ſection of a gooſe-egg-ſhell,</l>
               <l>Which in two equal portions ſhall divide</l>
               <l>The diſtance from the centre to the ſide.</l>
               <l>Fear not to ſlaver; 'tis no deadly ſin.</l>
               <l>Like the free Frenchman, from your joyous chin</l>
               <l>Suſpend the ready napkin, or, like me,</l>
               <l>Poiſe with one hand your bowl upon your knee;</l>
               <l>Juſt in the zenith your wiſe head project,</l>
               <l>Your full ſpoon, riſing in a line direct,</l>
               <l>Bold as a bucket, heeds no drops that fall,</l>
               <l>The wide mouth'd bowl will ſurely catch them all.</l>
