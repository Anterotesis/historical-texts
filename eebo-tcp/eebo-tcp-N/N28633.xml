            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <bibl>11. SAMUEL, iii.38.</bibl>
                  <p>KNOW YE NOT THAT THERE IS A PRINCE AND A GREAT MAN FALLEN THIS DAY IN ISRAEL?</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>YOU cannot hear theſe words, my Brethren, without thinking of an event, which, as the tidings of it fly from one meſſenger to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, from one city to another, and from one ſtate to another, ſpreads a gloom throughout this widely extended continent, and throws a whole nation into the deepeſt mourning. Like the ſhock of an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, or thunder from heaven, ſudden and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, we have heard the alarming intelligence, that WASHINGTON <hi>is dead.</hi>—What concern and grief overwhelm the minds of all virtuous citizens! In our American Iſrael <hi>is fallen a prince,</hi> eminent and diſtinguiſhed above all the other princes of the age; a man <hi>great</hi> in whatever can contribute to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence, dignity, and greatneſs of the human char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter, above all the other great men who dwell upon the face of the earth. Since the exit of the inſpired leaders of God's ancient Iſrael, it may be doubted, whether, among the generals, heroes, and ſtateſmen, who have ſince paſſed over the ſtage of life, and filled the world with the glory of their names and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits, ſo finiſhed a character as the father of his
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:038170_0004_10111465638BFDA8"/>
country, whom we this day lament, has departed from theſe regions of mortality.</p>
            <p>At all times, and through every age, a few men are diſtinguiſhed from the common maſs of their ſpecies, and, as compared with others, are denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated great. On account of eminence in ſeveral dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent reſpects, this appellation is given. In vulgar ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, great riches and power entitle their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors to be called great men. Speaking of Abner, David, in the text, calls him <hi>a prince and a great man,</hi> becauſe he was exalted, not only above his fellow-citizens in general, but above all the other high of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers under the crown, having been, through a great part of his life, captain of the hoſt, entruſted, under Saul, and afterward under his ſon, with the chief command of the armies of Iſrael. In this high ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he was univerſally known; and had acquired a weight of character, and an extent of influence, in the affairs of the nation, beyond that of any other citizen. His fall "muſt have inſpired every mind with grave and ſerious reflections. <hi>A great man fallen!</hi> and fallen by ſo unexpected and ſo ſurpriſing a treachery; and in the eye of a great revolution, ſeemingly dependent upon his fate!" Yet it muſt be remembered, that his was a worldly greatneſs only, without any mixture, or, at leaſt, predominance of real goodneſs. This great man had deliberately op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed himſelf to the known will of the great God; and had ſported with the lives of his brethren. He was not ignorant of the divine deſignation of David to the throne of Iſrael; yet, through motives of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and ambition, had <hi>made himſelf ſtrong for the houſe of Saul.</hi> Putting himſelf at the head of this nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous and powerful faction, he commenced a civil war; and, for a ſeries of years, compelled the nation
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:038170_0005_10111468746F08E0"/>
to endure its calamities. "It is true, that he was now returned to his duty; but it is as true, that he returned to it now, as he departed from it before, upon a pique, and from motives of ambition, intereſt, and revenge." By ſuch principles was this captain of the hoſt influenced, even in his beſt actions, and when he projected ſchemes for the public peace and proſperity. Still he was a great man in the eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, and had the power of a prince among the tribes of Iſrael.</p>
            <p>SIMILAR to his, has been the character of no ſmall proportion of the great men of the earth, through every ſucceſſive age. From the buſtle and noiſe which they have made in the world; from their victories and triumphs; from the changes and revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions which their counſels or exploits have effected in the affairs of ſtates and nations, they have been denominated great. Hiſtory informs us of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the great, of Pompey the great, of Charlemagne, Lewis the fourteenth, and the late Frederick; but when their characters are analyzed, the principles and motives of their conduct are ſcrutinized, what are they better than the great man in the text? They ſtand, it is true, as on an eminence, above the reſt of their ſpecies, the objects of general homage and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The glory of their names, and the ſplendor of their achievements, are preſerved in the annals of hiſtory, and handed down with eclat from one gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration to another. We are dazzled with the luſtre that ſurrounds them. When thus viewed at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, we admire their abilities, the vaſtneſs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of their ſchemes, their reach of thought, their penetration, their quick diſcernment of every advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, their dexterity in ſeizing it; their perſeverance, intrepidity, and ſucceſs. But, upon a cloſer inſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:038170_0006_1011146C1CEEC0E8"/>
of their characters, of their governing princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and views, the tendency of their plans, and the nature of the means by which they were proſecuted, our reaſon and judgment muſt withhold from them the approbation of the heart. We ſee theſe great men purſuing the ſame kind of policy, and influenced by the ſame paſſions and intereſted views, ſo apparent in the conduct of Abner. Whether they meditated peace or war, the tranquillity or diſturbance of the world, the proſperity or devaſtation of countries; ſtill intereſt, ambition, or revenge was their leading motive. While they governed nations and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded armies, it often appeared, that they had no command over themſelves. After gaining victories, taking citadels, and ſubduing countries, by <hi>having no rule over their own ſpirits,</hi> by ſetting no bounds to their ambition and cupidity, their minds reſembled the ruin which they had ſpread, <hi>a city broken down and without walls,</hi> conſtantly expoſed to the ravages of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant deſires and lawleſs paſſions.</p>
            <p>BUT though this want of ſelf-government has been the common defect in the character, not only of the great heroes and conquerors of the world, but of its great politicians and ſtateſmen, by whoſe counſels the affairs of nations and empires have been directed; yet, through the mercy of God, there have been ſome exceptions, ſome who have been <hi>good</hi> as well as great, whoſe great abilities have been accompanied with great virtues; and who have riſen to eminence and diſtinction by the joint diſplay of both. At the head of armies, and at the helm of government, there have been ſome, who, in the height of their elevation, amidſt all the allurements of intereſt, pride, ambition, and ſenſuality; while covered with glory, inveſted with power, and abounding in wealth, have
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:038170_0007_1011146FB6E836A0"/>
yet ſhown themſelves able to control their paſſions, to moderate their deſires, to forego all ſelfiſh views, and preſerve a character for piety, benevolence, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſtedneſs, juſtice, meekneſs, temperance, purity; in ſhort, for whatever is amiable, lovely, and praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy in religion, morals, and manners. Amidſt the greateſt difficulties, embarraſſments, and dangers of their public ſtations, their minds have been ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to fear, to mean compliances, unworthy conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, or diſhonourable expedients. Firm and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to the principles of rectitude and patriotiſm, they have uniformly conducted with integrity and uprightneſs. The viciſſitudes of fortune effected no change in their character or manners: they were the ſame, both in proſperity and in adverſity. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſmayed at the moſt formidable proſpects, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contaminated amidſt the ſtrongeſt temptations to corruption; no bribe could ſeduce them, no terror could overawe them. They were never melted by pleaſure into effeminacy, nor ſunk by misfortunes into deſpondency. In every ſituation, they ſteadily perſevered in diſcharging what they apprehended to be their duty, without being ſwayed by the applauſe or cenſures of the world, when theſe would have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them from following the dictates of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Though they were far from deſpiſing the opinions of their fellow-men, yet, conſidering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves accountable to God, and making his approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion their chief and ultimate aim; in compariſon with this, it was <hi>a ſmall thing with them to be judged by man's judgment.</hi> It was their great concern to be faithful to the Being whom they devoutly worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and to the principles of the religion which they ſeriouſly and ſincerely profeſſed. Abounding in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence towards mankind in general, they were faithful to their friends, generous to their enemies,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:038170_0008_10111473051B9248"/>
eaſily touched with compaſſion for the poor, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate and diſtreſſed; apparently inſenſible to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ill offices towards, and uncandid ſtrictures upon, themſelves; often ſelf-denying with reſpect to ſmaller private intereſts and pleaſures, but always zealous and ardent in whatever concerned the public welfare. In their private deportment and public conduct, they diſplayed dignity and magnanimity, without pride; humility, without meanneſs; juſtice, without par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, harſhneſs or ſeverity; liberality, without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion; courage, without raſhneſs or preſumption. With a nice ſenſe of propriety, they did every thing in the beſt manner, and at the moſt ſuitable ſeaſon. Wary and circumſpect, though not artful or deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they were wiſe and penetrating in diſcovering and eluding the ſnares of enemies and opponents; ſagacious and prudent in foreſeeing and guarding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt dangers and accidents; never expoſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or the cauſe with which they were entruſted, to any riſk, detriment, or embarraſſment, which could be decently and honourably avoided. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on the greateſt occaſions, and reſpectable on the leaſt; they were ſimple in their manners, though manly in their feelings. Their looks never deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; their word inſpired confidence; their profeſſions were always the effuſions of their hearts.</p>
            <p>CHARACTERS, like theſe, my brethren, will bear the cloſeſt ſcrutiny. The more minutely you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine them, the more rigidly you try them by the teſt of reaſon, truth, and rectitude, the more you will be conſtrained, in your hearts, to admire, reverence, eſteem, and love them. The luſtre of their moſt ſplendid actions, inſtead of being leſſened, is height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened and increaſed by taking into view, the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of their motives.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:038170_0009_1011147651EA78B8"/>SOME ſuch characters, my hearers, through the different ages, and among the different nations of the world, have exalted and adorned human nature, and ſhed a benign influence on human affairs. So ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, indeed, has been their appearance, that they have been mere phoenomena in the earth. With ſuch a phoenomenon, however, in its moſt full and perfect ſtate, it has pleaſed the Almighty to bleſs, honour, and diſtinguiſh the inhabitants of this new world, above all modern nations. Nay, I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to have read in any volume of profane hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, whether ancient or modern, nor even in the fictions of romance, of a ſingle character ſo exempt from every ſpot of vice, every ſhade of weakneſs or indiſcretion; ſo complete in the abilities of a General, in the talents of a Stateſman, in the virtues of a Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izen, and, in all other reſpects, equal to Him, who, at the call of his country, headed our armies through the long ſeries of trying ſcenes, which attended our revolution; whoſe influence ſaved our all from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loſt by diviſion; held together, or, at leaſt, was the moſt important tie in preventing the disjunction and diſſolution of the firſt ſlender and ill-cemented union of theſe ſtates; who preſided on the great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, when, by an ameliorated national compact, they were conſolidated; when the admirable machine of our preſent general government was conſtructed; who put this machine in motion, and, through the courſe of eight years, ſo guided its operations, as to enable his fellow-citizens fully to enjoy all its ſignal advantages; and after having retired, with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt dignity and honour, from the cares of ſtate, to ſpend the ſhort remains of life in preparation for its cloſing ſcene; foreign violence and intrigue, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined with the turbulent, malignant ſpirit of domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic faction, rearing their gorgon form, and menacing

the fair fabric which his labours had been ſo inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in raiſing, his patriotic ardour grew indignant; ſtepping back from his beloved retreat, he again bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhed his ſword; and, with all the majeſty of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-inſpired virtue, frowned on the rebel-rout of "demons let looſe." At this awful juncture, Divine Providence removed him from a world no longer worthy of ſuch goodneſs.</p>
            <p>IT remains, that we mourn, as we ought, the fall of this great and good man in our Iſrael. Not for his ſake perſonally, indeed, have we any occaſion, or ought we, to lament. From his work of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on earth, he is releaſed, that he may enjoy its reward in heaven. But for ourſelves, and our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, we have abundant reaſon to weep, exclaiming at his departure, <hi>my father, my father! the chariot of Iſrael, and the horſemen thereof.</hi> To the living, the loſs of ſuch a treaſure is incalculable. To him, the virtuous and good, all enlightened and true patriots, all the friends of real liberty, not only in America, but throughout Europe, looked up, as to a kind of head and exemplar; eſpecially at the preſent eventful and alarming era, when the name of liberty, the rights of man, and the nature of good government, are ſo dreadfully miſunderſtood, and ſo horribly abuſed; when ſo heavy a cloud overſpreads the civilized world, and the blind hurricane of revolution con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues its devaſtation. Our own government had indeed, upon his retreat, devolved upon able and faithful men; but ſtill he continued as a pillar for its ſupport. The weight of his opinion, and the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his example, were highly important in the balance againſt the novel and ſtrange opinions ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant at the preſent moment. What may enſue upon the loſs of ſuch a prop, we cannot but be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive.

We know it to be one of the methods of Divine Providence, when heavy calamities are in ſtore for any people, previouſly to remove from among them, thoſe who would ſtand in the gap, and be inſtrumental in warding them off. Previous to the miſery and ruin of his ancient people, <hi>becauſe their tongue and their doings were againſt the Lord,</hi> it was threatened, that <hi>the Lord, the Lord of hoſts, would take away from Judah and Jeruſalem, the mighty man, and the man of war; the judge and the prophet, the prudent and ancient, the honourable man and the counſellor.</hi> In fulfilment of this denunciation, a ſeemingly prema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture death was allotted to the eminently good Joſiah, on purpoſe that ſo meritorious a character might no longer avert or delay the deſerved puniſhment of a ſinful people; and in mercy to himſelf, that he might neither know nor ſhare in their miſeries. It is mentioned as a proof, both of the guilt and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity of the incorrigibly wicked, that <hi>they lay it not to heart; nor conſider that the righteous are taken away from the evil to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOTHING, my brethren, can be more proper or reaſonable, more prudent or intereſting to ourſelves, than that our grief and boding fears, on the preſent melancholy occaſion, ſhould induce us to forſake all our evil habits and practices; and rouſe us to a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere repentance and thorough amendment. To this we are called by the voice of providence, not in a ſingle event only, but by a continued ſeries of awful diſpenſations. For a long time paſt, the judgments of Heaven, in their moſt tremendous form, have been abroad in the earth. We cannot hope ultimately to eſcape them, unleſs we ſpeedily learn righteouſneſs. To this, as the only way of ſafety, natural reaſon and conſcience prompt us, and divine revelation moſt
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:038170_0012_101114824103F2E0"/>
earneſtly exhorts us. In this way we are allowed to hope, that our peace and tranquillity may yet be lengthened out and prolonged.</p>
            <p>WHEN we conſider the abſolute dependence of the univerſe of creatures upon its great Author; how he ſuperintends all human affairs, changing times and ſeaſons, ſuſpending on high the inviſible balance, containing the fates of nations, often giving to ſlight occurrences the power of turning this balance; of <hi>ſetting up kings and kingdoms,</hi> and then of <hi>putting them down;</hi> of <hi>enlarging and increaſing the nations,</hi> and then <hi>of ſtraitening them again;</hi> and that <hi>at what time he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth concerning a nation or kingdom, to build and to plant it, or to pluck up, pull down and deſtroy it;</hi> all ſhall be done according to his counſels; that all the commotions and revolutionary movements in every country, and among every people throughout the earth, with their hidden ſprings and cauſes, as well as their viſible conſequences and effects, are irreſiſtibly controled and unerringly directed by his univerſal providence, ſo as exactly to accompliſh the deſtinations of his will; when we think of theſe things, we cannot but feel how much it concerns us, both as individuals and as a nation, to be in a ſtate of favour with this omnipotent Ruler.</p>
            <p>IF we ſin againſt him, he has many ways in which to make us feel the effects of his diſpleaſure. It is not by death only, that he deprives ſuch a people of their benefactors, of thoſe good rulers who ſhield them from calamities. As it is he <hi>who giveth wiſdom to the wiſe,</hi> and <hi>knowledge to them who know underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> —who are <hi>ſkilful in the times,</hi> and in <hi>what Iſrael ought to do;</hi> as all the abilities of good rulers are from him, ſo he has threatened to withhold theſe bleſſings from a diſobedient people, to infatuate their
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:038170_0013_1011148596E64630"/>
public counſels, rendering <hi>their diviners mad,</hi> cauſing <hi>the wiſdom of their wiſe men to periſh, and the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their prudent men to be hidden;</hi> ſuffering all their affairs, through inteſtine diviſion and the violence of faction, to become embroiled, and to fall into ſuch confuſion, that there ſhall be <hi>no peace or ſafety to him that goes out, or to him that comes in.</hi> A ſorer judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or a greater miſery, can hardly be conceived, than a people thus ſet looſe from order and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and abandoned to the miſrule of their paſſions and the rage of parties.</p>
            <p>AMONG the many rich bleſſings, which Heaven has poured upon the people of theſe United States, through the medium of a WASHINGTON, one of the firſt magnitude has been our preſervation from this miſery. With what unwearied efforts, through the whole courſe of his public life, did he labour, night and day, to ſave us from being wrecked on this fatal rock? To the very laſt, he was ſo appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of our continued hazard in this reſpect, that, in his farewell addreſs, there is no other topic which he labours with ſuch copious and perſuaſive elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. Indeed, it is the chief and main object of the addreſs, to impreſs our minds with a ſenſe of the infinite importance of our continued union; and to put us upon our guard againſt the cauſes and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which may poſſibly occaſion diviſion. He tells us, that "the government, which conſtitutes us one people, is a main pillar in the edifice of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence, the ſupport of our tranquillity at home, our peace abroad; of our ſafety; of our proſperity; of that very liberty which we ſo highly prize." He warns us, that, "as this is the point in our political fortreſs, againſt which the batteries of internal and external enemies will be moſt conſtantly and actively
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:038170_0014_10111487293D7EC0"/>
(though often covertly and inſidiouſly) directed, it is of infinite moment that we properly eſtimate the immenſe value of our national union, to our collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and individual happineſs; that we cheriſh a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial, habitual, and immoveable attachment to it; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtoming ourſelves to think and ſpeak of it as the palladium of our political ſafety and proſperity; watching for its preſervation with jealous anxiety; diſcountenan<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

In ſhort, no dying father ever enjoined love and union upon his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren with more tender ſolicitude, more affectionate earneſtneſs, or more pathetic anxiety.</p>
            <p>NOW he is gone, forever gone, muſt not his ſage advice, his moſt intereſting, ſolemn, and paternal counſels, return upon the reflecting minds of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaved nation with redoubled force and energy, pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etrate all hearts, and have a permanent, a perpetual influence upon their conduct? Shall they not be handed down to poſterity, as a legacy more precious than any other inheritance from the beſt of anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; and through ſucceſſive generations, be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that filial reverence, and ſtrict obſervance, with which the deſcendants of Jonadab, the ſon of Rechab, continued, through a courſe of ages, to obey the more abitrary and apparently leſs important in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions of their father?</p>
            <p>SUCH a deference to them in general will be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, if one part of them in particular, I mean that which urges the neceſſity of religious principle, be generally felt, and duly eſtimated. "Of all diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:038170_0015_10111488B23A69E8"/>
and habits," ſays this venerable and unequalled patriot, "which lead to political proſperity, religion and morality are indiſpenſable ſupports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotiſm, who would labour to ſubvert theſe great pillars of human happineſs, theſe firmeſt props of the duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought to reſpect and cheriſh them. A volume could not trace all their connexions with private and public felicity. It is ſubſtantially true, that morality is a neceſſary ſpring of popular govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Reaſon and experience both forbid us to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that national morality can prevail in the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of religious principle." From ſuch a perſonage, how important, eſpecially in the preſent times, is this teſtimony to the uſefulneſs and neceſſity of religion!</p>
            <p>WHAT he here, by precept, ſo forcibly urges upon us, he has, in the moſt alluring and engaging man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, exemplified in his own practice. On religious principle, as their grand baſis, we have every reaſon to believe, his own great character, illuſtrious vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and extenſive uſefulneſs, were built. No other foundation ever did, or can ſuſtain ſo noble and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed a ſtructure.</p>
            <p>GREAT men, indeed, there have been, of whoſe religion we have yet reaſon to doubt. But from what were their greatneſs and celebrity derived? from the high ſtation, perhaps, to which birth, court-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, popular prejudice, corruption, uſurpation, or even violence ſucceeded in raiſing them; from excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in ſome particular profeſſion, art, ſcience, or branch of knowledge; from a lucky diſcovery or uſeful invention; or, it may be, from the mere ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price of fortune, in making them her choſen favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites; from ſome ſplendid action, which chance gave
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:038170_0016_101114901C0756B8"/>
them the opportunity of performing; from an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional diſplay of abilities in a particular ſituation, or during a certain portion of their lives. Not a few have blazed forth for a moment, and received, for a while, the applauſe of the public; who have, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, dwindled and ſunk into forgotten obſcurity. But no man, I will venture to affirm, not animated and ſupported by religious principle, ever paſſed a long life of inceſſant labour in the higheſt public ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, diverſified with ever varying and conſtantly trying ſcenes; and yet, through his whole progreſs, conducted with ſuch wiſdom, diligence, fidelity and diſintereſtedneſs, as uniformly to dignify and adorn each ſucceſſive ſtation, and every viciſſitude of condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; reflecting to the laſt, a ſteady, undiminiſhed luſtre in the eyes of an admiring and applauding world.</p>
            <p>MY brethren, it is incumbent upon us this day, with hearts glowing with gratitude, moſt devoutly to thank God, not only for the ſucceſs and proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which he has already conferred upon our nation, through the inſtrumentality of its now departed friend, but for the great benefits which we may hope ſtill to derive from the influence of that example of wiſdom, patriotiſm, virtue, and religion, which, as his falling mantle, we ſtill retain. What could have been more important to us, after our national and ſolid union under one general government, than the having of ſuch a character for our firſt chief magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate; the excellence of whoſe meaſures, counſels, and manner of adminiſtration, might ſerve as a model for his ſucceſſors in office. Indeed, his dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, prudence, faithfulneſs, and integrity, are a model for all public officers, of every grade and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, from the higheſt to the loweſt. In what
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:038170_0017_10111493C7A66F60"/>
he was, they may ſee what they ought to be. Nay, from the manner in which he preſided at the head of the nation, we may all learn how we ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in our reſpective families, and maintain order, peace, unity, virtue, and religion, in our houſes. In no way can we ſo honour his memory, as by the imitation of his virtues. This too will be the proper improvement of that melancholy diſpenſation of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence which has removed him from us. If, as a people, we copy after that example of rectitude and goodneſs which he has ſet us, we may hope that Heaven will continue to bleſs us with a ſucceſſion of rulers reſembling him. But, what is yet infinitely more important to us individually, by this only can we have a rational hope of dwelling forever hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with him, and others like him, in the general aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly <hi>of the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect. The memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of virtue is immortal. It is known with God and with men. When it is preſent, men take example at it; and when it is gone, they deſire it. It weareth a crown and triumpheth forever, ſtriving for undefiled rewards.</hi>

            </opener>
            <p>THE period for a new election of a citizen, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the executive government of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States, being not far diſtant, and the time actually arrived, when your thoughts muſt be employed in deſignating the perſon, who is to be clothed with that important truſt, it appears to me proper, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as it may conduce to a more diſtinct expreſſion of the public voice, that I ſhould now appriſe you of the reſolution I have formed, to decline being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered among the number of thoſe, out of whom a choice is to be made.</p>
            <p>I beg you, at the ſame time, to do me the juſtice to be aſſured, that this reſolution has not been taken without a ſtrict regard to all the conſiderations apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the relation, which binds a dutiful citizen to his country; and that, in withdrawing the tender of ſervice which ſilence in my ſituation might imply, I am influenced by no diminution of zeal for your future intereſt; no deficiency of grateful reſpect for your paſt kindneſs: but am ſupported by a full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction that the ſtep is compatible with both.</p>
            <p>The acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in office, to which your ſuffrages have twice called me, have been a uniform ſacrifice of inclination to the opinion of duty, and to a deference for what appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:038170_0019_10111496DEF87F50"/>
to be your deſire. I conſtantly hoped, that it would have been much earlier in my power, conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently with motives which I was not at liberty to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard, to return to that retirement, from which I had been reluctantly drawn. The ſtrength of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to do this, previous to the laſt election, had even led to the preparation of an addreſs to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then perplexed and critical poſture of affairs with foreign nations, and the unanimous advice of perſons entitled to my confidence, impelled me to abandon the idea.</p>
            <p>I rejoice, that the ſtate of your concerns, external as well as internal, no longer renders the purſuit of inclination incompatible with the ſentiment of duty, or propriety: and am perſuaded, whatever partial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity may be retained for my ſervice, that, in the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent circumſtances of our country, you will not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approve my determination to retire.</p>
            <p>The impreſſions, with which I firſt undertook the arduous truſt, were explained on the proper occaſion. In the diſcharge of this truſt, I will only ſay, that I have, with good intentions, contributed towards the organization and adminiſtration of the government, the beſt exertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable. Not unconſcious, in the out-ſet, of the inferiority of my qualifications, experience in my own eyes, perhaps ſtill more in the eyes of others, has ſtrengthened the motives to diffidence of myſelf: and every day the increaſing weight of years admon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhes me more and more, that the ſhade of retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is as neceſſary to me as it will be welcome. Satisfied that if any circumſtances have given pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar value to my ſervices, they were temporary, I have the conſolation to believe, that, while choice and prudence invite me to quit the political ſcene, pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riotiſm does not forbid it.</p>
            <p>In looking forward to the moment, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:038170_0020_1011149F82AEC868"/>
to terminate the career of my public life, my feelings do not permit me to ſuſpend the deep ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of that debt of gratitude which I owe to my beloved country, for the many honours it has conferred upon me; ſtill more for the ſteadfaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence with which it has ſupported me; and for the opportunities I have thence enjoyed of manifeſting my inviolable attachment, by ſervices faithful and perſevering, though in uſefulneſs unequal to my zeal. If benefits have reſulted to our country from theſe ſervices, let it always be remembered to our praiſe, and as an inſtructive example in our annals, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der circumſtances in which the paſſions, agitated in every direction, were liable to miſlead, amidſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances ſometimes dubious, viciſſitudes of fortune, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten diſcouraging in ſituations, in which not unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently want of ſucceſs has countenanced the ſpirit of criticiſm—the conſtancy of your ſupport was the eſſential prop of the efforts, and a guarantee of the plans, by which they were effected. Profoundly pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etrated with this idea, I ſhall carry it with me to my grave, as a ſtrong incitement to unceaſing vows, that Heaven may continue to you the choiceſt tokens of its beneficence—that your union and brotherly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection may be perpetual—that the free Conſtitution, which is the work of your hands, may be ſacredly maintained—that its adminiſtration, in every depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may be ſtamped with wiſdom and virtue— that, in fine, the happineſs of the people of theſe States, under the auſpices of liberty, may be made complete, by ſo careful a preſervation and ſo prudent a uſe of this bleſſing, as will acquire to them the glory of recommending it to the applauſe, the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and adoption of every nation which is yet a ſtranger to it.</p>
            <p>Here, perhaps, I ought to ſtop. But ſolicitude for your welfare, which cannot end but with my life,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:038170_0021_101114A123A42158"/>
and the apprehenſion of danger natural to that ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, urge me, on an occaſion like the preſent, to offer to your ſolemn contemplation, and to recommend to your frequent review, ſome ſentiments, which are the reſult of much reflection, of no inconſiderable obſervation, and which appear to me all-important to the permanency of your felicity as a people.— Theſe will be offered to you with the more freedom, as you can only feel in them the diſintereſted warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of a parting friend, who can poſſibly have no perſonal motive to bias his counſel. Nor can I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, as an encouragement to it, your indulgent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of my ſentiments on a former, and not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilar occaſion.</p>
            <p>Interwoven as is the love of liberty with every liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your hearts, no recommendation of mine is neceſſary to fortify or confirm the attachment.</p>
            <p>The unity of government, which conſtitutes you one people, is alſo now dear to you. It is juſtly ſo; for it is a main pillar in the edifice of your real inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence; the ſupport of your tranquillity at home, your peace abroad; of your ſafety; of your proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity; of that very liberty which you ſo highly prize. But, as it is eaſy to foreſee, that from differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſes, and from different quarters, much pains will be taken, many artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction of this truth; as this is the point in your political fortreſs, againſt which the batteries of internal and external enemies will be moſt conſtantly and actively (though often covertly and inſidiouſly) directed, it is of infinite moment that you ſhould properly eſtimate the immenſe value of your National Union, to your collective and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual happineſs; that you ſhould cheriſh a cordial, habitual, and immoveable attachment to it; accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toming yourſelves to think and ſpeak of it as of the palladium of your political ſafety and proſperity;
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:038170_0022_101114A2A956DAF0"/>
watching for its preſervation with jealous anxiety; diſcountenancing whatever may ſuggeſt even a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion that it can in any event be abandoned; and indignantly frowning upon the firſt dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the reſt, or to enfeeble the ſacred ties which now link together the various parts.</p>
            <p>For this, you have every inducement of ſympathy and intereſt. Citizens, by birth or choice, of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon country, that country has a right to concentrate your affections. The name of AMERICAN, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to you in your national capacity, muſt always exalt the juſt pride of patriotiſm, more than any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation derived from local diſcriminations. With ſlight ſhades of difference, you have the ſame religion, manners, habits, and political principles. You have, in a common cauſe, fought and triumphed together; the Independence and Liberty you poſſeſs are the work of joint councils, and joint efforts, of common dangers, ſufferings and ſucceſſes.</p>
            <p>But theſe conſiderations, however powerfully they addreſs themſelves to your ſenſibility, are greatly out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weighed by thoſe which apply more immediately to your intereſt. Here every portion of our country finds the moſt commanding motives for carefully guarding and preſerving the union of the whole.</p>
            <p>The <hi>North,</hi> in an unreſtrained intercourſe with the <hi>South,</hi> protected by the equal laws of a common gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, finds in the productions of the latter, great additional reſources of maritime and commercial en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, and precious materials of manufacturing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry. The <hi>South,</hi> in the ſame intercourſe, benefit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the agency of the <hi>North,</hi> ſees its agriculture grow, and its commerce expand. Turning partly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its own channels the ſeamen of the <hi>North,</hi> it finds its particular navigation invigorated; and while it contributes, in different ways, to nouriſh and increaſe
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:038170_0023_101114A5CB0A2818"/>
the general maſs of the national navigation, it looks forward to the protection of a maritime ſtrength, to which itſelf is unequally adapted. The <hi>Eaſt,</hi> in a like intercourſe with the <hi>Weſt,</hi> already finds, and, in the progreſſive improvement of interior communications, by land and water, will more and more find a valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able vent for the commodities which it brings from abroad, or manufactures at home. The <hi>Weſt</hi> derives from the <hi>Eaſt</hi> ſupplies requiſite to its growth and comfort; and, what is perhaps of ſtill greater conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, it muſt of neceſſity owe the <hi>ſecure</hi> enjoyment of indiſpenſable <hi>outlets</hi> for its own productions to the weight, influence, and the future maritime ſtrength of the Atlantic ſide of the Union, directed by an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluble community of intereſt as <hi>one nation.</hi> Any other tenure, by which the <hi>Weſt</hi> can hold this eſſential advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, whether derived from its own ſeparate ſtrength, or from an apoſtate and unnatural connexion with any foreign power, muſt be intrinſically precarious.</p>
            <p>While, then, every part of our country thus feels an immediate and particular intereſt in Union, all the parts combined cannot fail to find, in the united maſs of means and efforts, greater ſtrength, greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource, proportionably greater ſecurity from external danger, a leſs frequent interruption of their peace by foreign nations; and, what is of ineſtimable value! they muſt derive from Union an exemption from thoſe broils and wars between themſelves, which ſo frequently afflict neighbouring countries, not tied to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the ſame government; which their own rivalſhips alone would be ſufficient to produce, but which oppoſite foreign alliances, attachments, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues would ſtimulate and imbitter. Hence, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, they will avoid the neceſſity of thoſe overgrown military eſtabliſhments, which, under any form of government, are inauſpicious to liberty, and which are to be regarded as particularly hoſtile to Republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:038170_0024_101114A928F5AC08"/>
Liberty. In this ſenſe it is, that your Union ought to be conſidered as a main prop of your liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and that the love of the one ought to endear to you the preſervation of the other.</p>
            <p>Theſe conſiderations ſpeak a perſuaſive language to every reflecting and virtuous mind, and exhibit the continuance of the UNION as a primary object of a patriotic deſire. Is there a doubt, whether a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon government can embrace ſo large a ſphere? Let experience ſolve it. To liſten to mere ſpeculation, in ſuch a caſe, were criminal. We are authoriſed to hope, that a proper organization of the whole, with the auxiliary agency of governments for the reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſubdiviſions, will afford a happy iſſue to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment. It is well worth a fair and full experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. With ſuch powerful and obvious motives to Union, affecting all parts of our country, while ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment ſhall not have demonſtrated its impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, there will always be reaſon to diſtruſt the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riotiſm of thoſe, who in any quarter may endeavour to weaken its bands.</p>
            <p>In contemplating the cauſes which may diſturb our Union, it occurs as matter of ſerious concern, that any ground ſhould be furniſhed for characteriſing parties, by <hi>Geographical</hi> diſcriminations—<hi>Northern</hi> and <hi>Southern—Atlantic</hi> and <hi>Weſtern</hi>—whence deſigning men may endeavour to excite a belief, that there is a real difference of local intereſts and views. One of the expedients of party to acquire influence, within particular diſtricts, is to miſrepreſent the opinions and aims of other diſtricts. You cannot ſhield your ſelves too much againſt the jealouſies and heart-burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which ſpring from theſe miſrepreſentations: they tend to render alien to each other thoſe who ought to be bound together by fraternal affection. The inhabitants of our weſtern country have lately had a uſeful leſſon on this head: they have ſeen, in
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:038170_0025_101114AC58727BE0"/>
the negociation by the Executive, and in the unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imous ratification by the Senate, of the treaty with Spain, and in the univerſal ſatisfaction at that event, throughout the United States, a deciſive proof how unfounded were the ſuſpicions, propagated among them, of a policy in the general government and in the Atlantic ſtates unfriendly to their intereſts in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Miſſiſippi: they have been witneſſes to the formation of two treaties, that with Great-Britain and that with Spain, which ſecure to them every thing they could deſire, in reſpect to our foreign re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, towards confirming their proſperity. Will it not be their wiſdom to rely, for the preſervation of theſe advantages, on the UNION by which they were procured? Will they not henceforth be deaf to thoſe adviſers, if ſuch there are, who would ſever them from their brethren, and connect them with aliens?</p>
            <p>To the efficacy and permanency of your Union, a government for the whole is indiſpenſable. No al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liances, however ſtrict, between the parts, can be an adequate ſubſtitute; they will inevitably experience the infractions and interruptions which all alliances, in all times, have experienced. Senſible of this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous truth, you have improved upon your firſt eſſay, by the adoption of a conſtitution of a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, better calculated than your former, for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Union, and for the efficacious management of your common concerns. This government, the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of your own choice, uninfluenced and unawed, adopted upon full inveſtigation and mature delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, completely free in its principles, in the diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its powers, uniting ſecurity with energy, and containing within itſelf a proviſion for its own a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, has a juſt claim to your confidence and your ſupport. Reſpect for its authority, compliance with its laws, acquieſcence in its meaſures, are duties enjoined by the fundamental maxims of true liberty.
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:038170_0026_101114AFDB2510F0"/>
The baſis of our political ſyſtems is the right of the people to make and to alter their conſtitutions of government. But, the conſtitution which at any time exiſts, till changed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people, is ſacredly obligatory upon all. The very idea of the power and the right of the people to eſtabliſh government, preſuppoſes the duty of every individual to obey the eſtabliſhed government.</p>
            <p>All obſtructions to the execution of the Laws, all combinations and aſſociations, under whatever plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible character, with the real deſign to direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and action of the conſtituted authorities, are deſtructive of this fundamental principle, and of fatal tendency. They ſerve to organize faction, to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put in the place of the dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated will of the nation, the will of a party, often a ſmall, but artful and enterpriſing minority of the community; and, according to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to make the public adminiſtration the mirror of the ill-concerted and incongruous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of faction, rather than the organ of conſiſtent and wholeſome plans, digeſted by common councils and modified by mutual intereſts.</p>
            <p>However combinations, or aſſociations, of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove deſcription, may now and then anſwer popular ends, they are likely, in the courſe of time and things, to become potent engines, by which cunning, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the power of the people, and to uſurp for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the reins of government; deſtroying after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the very engines which have lifted them to unjuſt dominion.</p>
            <p>Towards the preſervation of your government, and the permanency of your preſent happy ſtate, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, not only that you ſteadily diſcountenance ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular oppoſition to its acknowledged authority, but
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:038170_0027_101114B4DA05A2E8"/>
alſo that you reſiſt, with care, the ſpirit of innovation upon its principles, however ſpecious the pretexts.— One method of aſſault may be to effect, in the forms of the conſtitution, alterations which will impair the energy of the ſyſtem, and thus to undermine what cannot be directly overthrown. In all the changes, to which you may be invited, remember, that time and habit are at leaſt as neceſſary to fix the true character of government, as of other human inſtitutions; that experience is the ſureſt ſtandard, by which to teſt the real tendency of the exiſting conſtitution of a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; that facility in changes, upon the credit of mere hypotheſis and opinion, expoſes to perpetual change, from the endleſs variety of hypotheſis and opinion; and remember, eſpecially, that for the efficient man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement of your common intereſt, in a country ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive as ours, a government of as much vigour as is conſiſtent with the perfect ſecurity of liberty, is indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable. Liberty itſelf will find in ſuch a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with powers properly diſtributed and adjuſted, its ſureſt guardian. It is, indeed, little elſe than a name, where the government is too feeble to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the enterpriſes of faction, to confine each mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the ſociety within the limits preſcribed by the laws, and to maintain all in the ſecure and tranquil enjoyment of the rights of perſon and property.</p>
            <p>I have already intimated to you, the danger of parties in the ſtate, with particular reference to the founding of them on geographical diſcriminations. Let me now take a more comprehenſive view, and warn you, in the moſt ſolemn manner, againſt the baneful effects of the ſpirit of party, generally.</p>
            <p>This ſpirit, unfortunately, is inſeparable from our nature, having its root in the ſtrongeſt paſſions of the human mind. It exiſts, under different ſhapes, in all governments—more or leſs ſtifled, controled, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; but in thoſe of the popular form, it is ſeen in
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:038170_0028_101114B816284978"/>
its greateſt rankneſs, and is truly their worſt enemy.</p>
            <p>The alternate domination of one faction over an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, ſharpened by the ſpirit of revenge, natural to party diſſention, which, in different ages and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, has perpetrated the moſt horrid enormities, is itſelf a frightful deſpotiſm: but this leads at length to a more formal and permanent deſpotiſm. The diſorders and miſeries, which reſult, gradually incline the minds of men to ſeek ſecurity and repoſe in the abſolute power of an individual; and, ſooner or later, the chief of ſome prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, turns this diſpoſition to the purpoſes of his own elevation, on the ruins of Public Liberty.</p>
            <p>Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind, (which nevertheleſs ought not to be entirely out of ſight), the common and continual miſchiefs of the ſpirit of party are ſufficient to make it the intereſt and duty of a wiſe people to diſcourage and reſtrain it.</p>
            <p>It ſerves always to diſtract the Public Councils, and enfeeble the Public Adminiſtration. It agitates the community with ill-founded jealouſies and falſe alarms; kindles the animoſity of one part againſt another, and foments, occaſionally, riot and inſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It opens the door to foreign influence and corruption, which find a facilitated acceſs to the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment itſelf through the channels of party paſſions. Thus the policy and will of one country are ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the policy and will of another.</p>
            <p>There is an opinion, that parties in free countries are uſeful checks upon the adminiſtration of the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, and ſerve to keep alive the ſpirit of Liberty. This, within certain limits, is probably true; and in governments of a monarchical caſt, patriotiſm may look with indulgence, if not with favour, upon the ſpirit of party. But in thoſe of the popular charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in governments purely elective, it is a ſpirit not
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:038170_0029_101114B99BB6A290"/>
to be encouraged. From their natural tendency, it is certain, there will always be enough of that ſpirit for every ſalutary purpoſe. And there being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant danger of exceſs, the effort ought to be, by force of public opinion, to mitigate and aſſuage it: a fire not to be quenched, it demands uniform vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance to prevent its burſting into a flame, leſt, inſtead of warming, it ſhould conſume.</p>
            <p>It is important, likewiſe, that the habits of thinking, in a free country, ſhould inſpire caution, in thoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with its adminiſtration, to confine themſelves within their reſpective conſtitutional ſpheres, avoiding in the exerciſe of the powers of one department to encroach upon another. The ſpirit of encroachment tends to conſolidate the powers of all the depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in one; and thus to create, whatever be the form of Government, a real deſpotiſm. A juſt eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of that love of power, and proneneſs to abuſe it, which predominates in the human heart, is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſatisfy us of the truth of this poſition. The neceſſity of reciprocal checks in the exerciſe of the political power, by dividing and diſtributing it into different depoſitories, and conſtituting each the guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of the public weal againſt invaſions by the oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, has been evinced by experiments, ancient and modern; ſome of them in our country, and under our own eyes. To preſerve them, muſt be as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary as to inſtitute them. If, in the opinion of the people, the diſtribution or modification of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional powers be in any particular wrong, let it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the conſtitution deſignates: but let there be no change by uſurpation; for though this, in one inſtance, may be the inſtrument of good, it is the cuſtomary wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, by which free governments are deſtroyed. The precedent muſt always greatly overbalance, in perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent evil, any partial or tranſient benefit which the uſe can at any time yield.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:038170_0030_101114BB237BC168"/>Of all the diſpoſitions and habits, which lead to political proſperity, Religion and Morality are indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable ſupports. In vain would that Man claim the tribute of Patriotiſm, who would labour to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert theſe great pillars of human happineſs, theſe firmeſt props of the duties of Men and Citizens.— The mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought to reſpect and to cheriſh them. A volume could not trace all their connexions with private and public felicity. Let it ſimply be aſked, where is the ſecurity for property, for reputation, for life, if the ſenſe of religious obligation deſert the oaths which are the inſtruments of inveſtigation in courts of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice? and let us with caution indulge the ſuppoſition, that Morality can be maintained without Religion. Whatever may be conceded of the influence of refin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed education on minds of peculiar ſtructure, reaſon and experience both forbid us to expect that national Morality can prevail in excluſion of religious principle.</p>
            <p>It is ſubſtantially true, that virtue or morality is a neceſſary ſpring of popular government. The rule, indeed, extends, with more or leſs force, to every ſpecies of free government. Who that is a ſincere friend to it, can look with indifference upon attempts to ſhake the foundation of the fabric?</p>
            <p>Promote, then, as an object of primary importance, inſtitutions for the general diffuſion of knowledge. In proportion as the ſtructure of a government gives force to public opinion, it is eſſential that public opinion ſhould be enlightened.</p>
            <p>As a very important ſource of ſtrength and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, cheriſh public credit. One method of preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, is to uſe it as ſparingly as poſſible; avoiding oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of expenſe by cultivating peace; but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering alſo, that timely diſburſements, to prepare for danger, frequently prevent much greater diſburſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to repel it: avoiding, likewiſe, the accumula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:038170_0031_101114BFF60A4A20"/>
of debt, not only by ſhunning occaſions of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe, but by vigorous exertions, in time of peace, to diſcharge the debts which unavoidable wars may have occaſioned, not ungenerouſly throwing upon poſterity the burden which we ourſelves ought to bear. The execution of theſe maxims belongs to your repreſentatives, but it is neceſſary that public opinion ſhould co-operate. To facilitate to them the performance of their duty, it is eſſential that you ſhould practically bear in mind, that towards the payment of debts there muſt be revenue; that to have revenue, there muſt be taxes; and none can be deviſed, which are not, more or leſs, inconvenient and unpleaſant; that the intrinſic embarraſſment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable from the ſelection of the proper objects (which is always a choice of difficulties) ought to be a deciſive motive for a candid conſtruction of the conduct of the government in making it, and for a ſpirit of acquieſcence in the meaſures for obtaining revenue, which the public exigencies may at any time dictate.</p>
            <p>Obſerve good faith and juſtice towards all nations; cultivate peace and harmony with all: Religion and Morality enjoin this conduct; and can it be, that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be worthy of a free, enlightened, and (at no diſtant pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod) a great nation, to give to mankind the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous and too novel example of a people always guided by an exalted juſtice and benevolence. Who can doubt, that in the courſe of time and things, the fruits of ſuch a plan would richly repay any tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary advantages which might be loſt by a ſteady ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to it? Can it be, that Providence has not connected the permanent felicity of a nation with Virtue? The experiment, at leaſt, is recommended by every ſentiment which ennobles human nature. Alas! is it rendered impoſſible by its vices?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:038170_0032_101114C5180DDA28"/>In the execution of ſuch a plan, nothing is more eſſential than that permanent, inveterate antipathies againſt particular nations, and paſſionate attachments for others, ſhould be excluded; and that, in the place of them, juſt and amicable feelings towards all ſhould be cultivated. The nation which indulges towards another an habitual hatred, or an habitual fondneſs, is in ſome degree a ſlave. It is a ſlave to its animoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity or to its affection, either of which is ſufficient to lead it aſtray from its duty and its intereſt. Antip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>athy in one nation againſt another, diſpoſes each more readily to offer inſult and injury, to lay hold of ſlight cauſes of umbrage, and to be haughty and intractable, when accidental or trifling occaſions of diſpute occur.</p>
            <p>Hence frequent colliſions, obſtinate, envenomed and bloody conteſts. The nation, prompted by ill-will and reſentment, ſometimes impels to war the government, contrary to the beſt calculations of pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icy. The government ſometimes participates in the national propenſity, and adopts through paſſion what reaſon would reject; at other times, it makes the animoſity of the nation ſubſervient to projects of hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility, inſtigated by pride, ambition, and other ſiniſter and pernicious motives. The peace often, ſometimes perhaps the liberty, of nations has been the victim.</p>
            <p>So, likewiſe, a paſſionate attachment of one nation for another produces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favourite Nation, facilitating the illuſion of an imaginary common intereſt, in caſes where no real common intereſt exiſts, and infuſing into one the enmities of the other, betrays the former into a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation in the quarrels and wars of the latter, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out adequate inducement or juſtification. It leads alſo to conceſſions to the favourite nation of privileges denied to others, which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the conceſſions, by unneceſſarily part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:038170_0033_1010DD42F8A3D8F0"/>
with what ought to have been retained, and by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing jealouſy, ill-will, and a diſpoſition to retaliate, in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld: and it gives to ambitious, corrupted, or deluded citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens (who devote themſelves to the favourite nation) facility to betray, or ſacrifice the intereſts of their own country, without odium, ſometimes even with popularity; gilding, with the appearances of a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſenſe of obligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable zeal for public good, the baſe or fooliſh compliances of ambition, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or infatuation.</p>
            <p>As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, ſuch attachments are particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent patriot. How many opportunities do they afford to tamper with domeſtic factions, to practiſe the arts of ſeduction, to miſlead public opinion, to influence or awe the public counſels; ſuch an attachment of a ſmall or weak, towards a great and powerful nation, dooms the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer to be the ſatellite of the latter.</p>
            <p>Againſt the inſidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to believe me, fellow citizens), the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy of a free people ought to be <hi>conſtantly</hi> awake; ſince hiſtory and experience prove, that foreign in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence is one of the moſt baneful foes of republican government. But that jealouſy, to be uſeful, muſt be impartial; elſe it becomes the inſtrument of the very influence to be <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ided, inſtead of a defence againſt it. Exceſſive partiality for one foreign nation, and exceſſive diſlike of another, cauſe thoſe whom they actuate to ſee danger only on one ſide, and ſerve to veil, and even ſecond the arts of influence on the other. Real patriots, who may reſiſt the intrigues of the favourite, are liable to become ſuſpected and odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; while its tools and dupes uſurp the applauſe and confidence of the people, to ſurrender their intereſts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:038170_0034_101114CA2DBAC598"/>The great rule of conduct for us, in regard to foreign nations, is, in extending our commercial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, to have with them as little <hi>political</hi> connexion as poſſible. So far as we have already formed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith. Here let us ſtop.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Europe</hi> has a ſet of primary intereſts, which to us have none, or a very remote relation. Hence ſhe muſt be engaged in frequent controverſies, the cauſes of which are eſſentially foreign to our concerns.— Hence, therefore, it muſt be unwiſe in us to impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate ourſelves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary viciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitudes of her politics, or the ordinary combinations and colliſions of her friendſhips or enmities.</p>
            <p>Our detached and diſtant ſituation invites and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables us to purſue a different courſe. If we remain one people, under an efficient government, the period is not far off, when we may defy material injury from external annoyance; when we may take ſuch an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude as will cauſe the neutrality, we may at any time reſolve upon, to be ſcrupulouſly reſpected; when belligerent nations, under the impoſſibility of making acquiſitions upon us, will not lightly hazard the giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us provocation; when we may chooſe peace or war, as our intereſt, guided by juſtice, ſhall counſel.</p>
            <p>Why forego the advantages of ſo peculiar a ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Why quit our own, to ſtand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our deſtiny with that of any part of Europe <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>tangle our peace and proſperity in the toils of European ambition, rival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, intereſt, humour, or caprice?</p>
            <p>It is our true policy to ſteer clear of permanent alliances, with any portion of the foreign world; ſo far, I mean, as we are now at liberty to do it; for let me not be underſtood, as capable of patronizing infidelity to exiſting engagements. I hold the max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im no leſs applicable to public than to private affairs,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:038170_0035_101114CF305EEF40"/>
that honeſty is always the beſt policy. I repeat it, therefore, let thoſe engagements be obſerved in their genuine ſenſe. But, in my opinion, it is unneceſſary, and would be unwiſe to extend them.</p>
            <p>Taking care always to keep ourſelves, by ſuitable eſtabliſhments, on a reſpectable defenſive poſture, we may ſafely truſt to temporary alliances for extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary emergencies.</p>
            <p>Harmony, liberal intercourſe with all nations, are recommended by policy, humanity, and intereſt. But even our commercial policy ſhould hold an equal and impartial hand; neither ſending or granting excluſive favours or preferences; conſulting the natural courſe of things; diffuſing and diverſifying, by gentle means, the ſtreams of commerce, but forcing nothing; eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing, with powers ſo diſpoſed, in order to give trade a ſtable courſe, to define the rights of our merchants, and to enable the government to ſupport them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventional rules of intercourſe, the beſt that preſent circumſtances and mutual opinion will permit, but temporary, and liable to be, from time to time, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned or varied, as experience and circumſtances ſhall dictate; conſtantly keeping in view, that it is folly in one nation to look for diſintereſted favours from another; that it muſt pay, with a portion of its independence, for whatever it may accept under that character; that, by ſuch acceptance, it may place itſelf in the condition of having given equivalents for nominal favours, and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

There can be no greater error than to expect, or calculate upon real favours from nation to nation. It is an illuſion which experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence muſt cure, which a juſt pride ought to diſcard.</p>
            <p>In offering to you, my countrymen, theſe counſels of an old affectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the ſtrong and laſting impreſſion I could wiſh; that they will control the uſual current of the

paſſions, or prevent our nation from running <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> courſe which has hitherto marked the deſtiny of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: but if I may even flatter myſelf, that they may be productive of ſome partial benefit, ſome occaſional good; that they may now and then recur to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the fury of party ſpirit, to warn againſt the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs of foreign intrigue, to guard againſt the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures of pretended patriotiſm; this hope will be a full recompence for the ſolicitude for your welfare, by which they have been dictated.</p>
            <p>How far, in the diſcharge of my official duties, I have been guided by the principles which have been delineated, the public records, and other evidences of my conduct, muſt witneſs to you and to the world. To myſelf, the aſſurance of my own conſcience is, that I have at leaſt believed myſelf to be guided by them.</p>
            <p>In relation to the ſtill ſubſiſting war in Europe, my Proclamation of the 22d of April, 1795, is the index to my plan. Sanctioned by your approving voice, and by that of your Repreſentatives in both Houſes of Congreſs, the ſpirit of that meaſure has continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally governed me; uninfluenced by any attempts to deter or divert me from it.</p>
            <p>After deliberate examination, with the aid of the beſt lights I could obtain, I was well ſatisfied that our country, under all the circumſtances of the caſe, had a right to take, and was bound in duty and intereſt to take a neutral poſition. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>ng taken it, I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, as far as ſhould <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> on me, to maintain it, with moderation.</p>
            <p>The conſiderations which <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the right to hold this conduct, it is not neceſſary on this occaſion to detail. I will only obſerve, that according to my underſtanding of the matter, that right, ſo far from being denied by any of the belligerent powers, has been virtually admitted by all.</p>
            <p>The duty of holding a neutral conduct may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:038170_0037_101114D3D4CF3D70"/>
without any thing more, from the obligation which juſtice and humanity impoſe on every nation, in caſes in which it is free to act, to maintain inviolate the relations of peace and amity towards other nations.</p>

               </gap> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct will beſt be referred to your own reflections and experience. With me, a predominant motive has been to endeavour to gain time to our country to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and mature its yet recent inſtitutions, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs without interruption, to that degree of ſtrength and conſiſtency, which is neceſſary to give it, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly ſpeaking, the command of its own fortunes.</p>
            <p>Though in reviewing the incidents of my admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, I am unconſcious of intentional error; I am nevertheleſs too ſenſible of my defects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. Whatever they may be, I fervently beſeech the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty to avert or mitigate the evils, to which they may tend. I ſhall alſo carry with me the hope that my country will never ceaſe to view them with indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; and that after forty-five years of my life ded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icated to its ſervice, with <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
