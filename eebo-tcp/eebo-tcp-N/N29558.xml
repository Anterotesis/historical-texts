            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </figure> By His EXCELLENCY, Richard, Earl of Bellomont, Captain General and GOVERNOUR in Chief of the said Province, &amp;c. A Proclamation.</head>
            <p>WHEREAS I have Received credible Information That some evil-minded and wicked Emissaries, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciously designing and intending to disturb the peace and tranquility of His Majesties Good Subjects within His Majesties Provinces &amp; Colonies in America, have been imployed and industriously endeavoured falsely to suggest and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuate to the Indians of the several Plantations within the same, as if his Majesty had withdrawn his Protection from them; and designed to cut off and utterly extirpate them. By which lying Reports many of the said Indians have been abused and put in fear, and are said to have entred into a Combination and Confederacy, and to be drawn together in considerable Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, threatning a general Insurrection, and in a hostile manner to fall upon his Majesties Subjects the English.</p>
            <p>I have therefore, upon a motion from the Assembly now Sitting, and by and with the Advice and Consent of His Majesties Council, thought fit to Emit and Publish this Proclamation; hereby Commanding and Requiring all His Majesties Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Subjects within this His Majesties Province of the Massachusetts Bay, speedily to endeavour by all opportunities and possible ways and means that they can, to undeceive the said Indians, and to inform them of the utter Falsehood and Untruth of any such Report; and on the contrary to assure them, as I do hereby assure them of His Majesties good Inclinations and Favour, and continuing of them under His Protection, whilst they demean themselves peaceably, and remain in their Subjection &amp; Obedience unto His Majesty and His Government. Also Requiring all persons to avoid giving any just provocation unto any of the Indians, or begetting any quarrel with them: however in the mean time and during the threatned danger, to be very careful and vigilant in observing the behaviour and motions of the Indians, and for that purpose to keep out Scouts and Espials; and by all due ways and means to provide for their own safety and defence: And by force of Arms to Repel and Resist any hostile Attack or violence which the Indians shall attempt to offer or make upon them.</p>
            <p>Given at the Council-Chamber in <hi>Boston</hi> the Fourteenth Day of <hi>March,</hi> 1699. And in the Twelfth Year of the Reign of our Sovereign Lord, <hi>WILLIAM</hi> the Third by the Grace of GOD, of <hi>England, Scotland, France</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> KING, <hi>Defender of the Faith,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
