            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>I Muſt acknowledge, with grief of Soul, that by reading <hi>Arminian Books,</hi> and ſome of the Writings of ſuch as are called Free-Thinkers, I came to be ſo ſtumbled at the <hi>Doctrine of Election,</hi> that I could not hear it preached without being very uneaſy. Still I
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:004166_0002_1003F15E28CD4830"/>
read, and was mightily pleas'd in reading what ſo much exalts Man, and nouriſhes the natural bent and biaſs we have to ſet up Self, and a dreadful lothneſs to be at God's diſpoſal: that it ſhould be at his ſovereign Will whether we ſhould be converted and ſaved, or left to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in our Sin and Unbelief; and that the Lord ſhould give this as the Reaſon why he would have Mercy on ſome, and not on others; <hi>even becauſe it is his Will, and becauſe it ſeemeth good in his Sight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the ſame Time, I fell into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of ſome Men of Wit and Learning, whoſe Diſcourſe was much upon the ſame Strain. All ſeem'd to agree in this, that our <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Election</hi> could not conſiſt with the Truth, Juſtice, and Mercy of God.</p>
            <p>Thus I was led on in the Way of <hi>free Will,</hi> as it ſtands in oppoſition to <hi>free Grace;</hi> quite beſide and contrary to the way of Salvation. But my Conſcience would often check me for hankering after and liſtning to thoſe Doctrines; whilſt I was e'en bewitch'd away from the Truth as it is in Jeſus, and carry'd further into plauſible and pleaſing, but dangerous Errors; till it pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God (I hope in everlaſting Mercy to my Soul) to viſit me with very great and ſore out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Afflictions, which brought on darkneſs and diſtreſs of Mind and Conſcience, to a great Degree; and it ſeem'd as if I had but a little
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:004166_0003_1003F307C85BE868"/>
while to live; ſo I ſpent almoſt whole Days alone, meditating Terror; and in the Night, ſleep departed from mine Eyes.</p>
            <p>In this doleful Condition, which I can't ſet forth to the full, I remembred the mighty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions I had been under in my youthful Time; and how, then I had pleaded God's free and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Love to the vileſt of Sinners; and how ſweet the Doctrine of Election was then, and how relieving, whilſt I was conſtrained to plead Guilty; and had Nothing, no not ſo much as one good Deſire, that I could poſſibly raiſe in my ſelf, which might recommend me to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God.— I tho't I muſt take the ſame Courſe now, in hope that God had <hi>loved me</hi> with an <hi>everlaſting Love,</hi> and that therefore with <hi>loving Kindneſs he would draw me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how did my Conſcience fly in my Face: — How ſhould I think on that for my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in my Diſtreſs, which I had ſo quarrel'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt? Then I cried to God to forgive me all my hard and murmuring Thoughts againſt the Doctrine of Election, and the Preachers of it. And when I had freely, and, I hope, humbly and penitently confeſſed my ſerpentine oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Truth; (for I believe it was from the ſubtil and venemous old Serpent) then I could find ſome relief in thinking of electing Love from all Eternity; and I was bro't to ſee, how that at firſt, we had a ſufficient Stock in <hi>Adam</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:004166_0004_1003F2F3E87E1AA8"/>
(had we improv'd it) to ſecure our everlaſting Happineſs; but we fooliſhly and wilfully em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezeled it away; and the <hi>firſt Man,</hi> with his <hi>whole Race,</hi> had been <hi>irrecoverably loſt;</hi> as the <hi>Angels</hi> who kept not their firſt Eſtate, are <hi>reſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Chains to the Judgment of the great Day;</hi> had not God <hi>choſen a Remnant in Chriſt, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Adam:</hi> So that all our Hope, now, muſt be in Chriſt, and in God's electing Love thro' him: who is pleaſed to ſend the Spirit to bring home to the elect Soul the Father's everlaſting Love, and the Son's eternal Redemption by effectual Application.</p>
            <p>Here I had relief; and on this Foundation I deſire to build my Hope; which Hope, caſt within the Vail, is a ſure Anchor. So I was brought to bleſs God for Election; had it not been for which, there would have been no more Hope for fallen Man than for fallen Angels.</p>
            <p>After I had penned down theſe my Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I had great ſtruglings within, whether I ſhould impart ſuch Things to any one in the World. I had not, as yet, diſcover'd any thing, unleſs by dark and ſhort hints, to a boſom Friend. Sometimes I ſhould think it beſt to conceal them; then it would run thus in my Mind; If you diſcloſe and make them known (without diſcovering your ſelf to the World) how know you but that ſome poor ſtragling Sheep of Chriſt, loſt in the Wilderneſs, and ready to be torn in
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004166_0005_1003F1A3C7A1E350"/>
pieces by Wolves in Sheeps Cloathing, ſhall be found out by theſe very Means, and brought home to Chriſt? Then what cauſe of Joy would there be! So I thought it might be a Sin in me not to make known what God had done for my Soul, and how narrowly I eſcaped.</p>
            <p>I know not how it may be with others; but as for poor me (one of the chief of Sinners and the leaſt of Believers: <hi>So fooliſh have I been, and ignorant!</hi> — O Fool that I am, and ſlow of Heart to believe) — I am now reſolved, God helping me, to lie at the foot of divine Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, putting my Mouth in the Duſt, if ſo be there may be Hope. And if Chriſt ſhould, after all, reject me and caſt me off for ever, he can do me no wrong. I am utterly loſt in the <hi>firſt Adam,</hi> whoſe Sin is juſtly imputed to me; and I have ſo wretchedly oppos'd the <hi>ſecond A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> who came to ſeek &amp; ſave that which was loſt, that I can't but know, if I periſh, my Ruin will be of my ſelf. <hi>O Iſrael thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf; but in me is thy Help.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have nothing to depend on but electing Love, redeeming Mercy, and renewing Grace; all infinitely free! And if any wicked Thoughts ariſe, at any time, in my fooliſh, blind and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Heart, contrary to what I here declare and profeſs, I muſt caſt them away with abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. And whatever become of me, its a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thought to me, that Others may take warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004166_0006_1003F19C42E8EF20"/>
and Miniſters may be embolden'd to preach up the Doctrine of free ſovereign Grace, in every Branch of it, and not ſpare.</p>
            <p>But to go on; I was, as I ſaid, brought to ſubmit to the righteous Sovereignty of the Lord, whoſe Name is Holy. And in pleading God's everlaſting Love, I ſeem'd to have freſh expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the Love of Chriſt; and the Lord ſeem'd to ſmile on me in his Providence, in the midſt of frowning Diſpenſations — I could give particular Inſtances of it; but I forbear.—</p>
            <p>Now, in the multitude of my Thoughts, it came into my Mind to <hi>renew my Covenant with God;</hi> and I did it in a ſolemn Manner, and as compoſedly as could be, under ſuch diſtreſſing and almoſt diſtracting Trouble: Outward and inward Sorrows, like two Seas, meeting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.— And it was my purpoſe to renew my Covenant every Day; ſtill pleading for Mercy, free Mercy to the very chief of Sinners; giving thanks to the Lord, that yet there ſhould be a remnant according to the Election of Grace. Lord! thou haſt <hi>choſen ſome to Salvation, through ſanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the Truth:</hi> and I know not but I am one of them. —The Offers of Grace are without Exception. <hi>This is a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, that Chriſt Jeſus came into the World to ſave Sinners, of whom I am chief.</hi> I ſaw plainly that by all that I had done or could do, I
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004166_0007_1003F30AD265A7E0"/>
could not deſerve ſo much as a crumb of Bread, or a drop of Water. I ſaw, at the ſame Time, that there was enough in Chriſt to juſtify, ſanctify, and ſave eternally, the worſt Sinner in the World: and I deſire to have my entire dependance on Him ſtill, daily renewing my Covenant; that I may maintain a cloſe Walk with God, and be fortifyed againſt new Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
            <p>About this Time, I went into a Stationer's Shop, as I uſed frequently to do; and there I eſpy'd ſome of the <hi>Arminian Books;</hi> ſuch as I had read but too much in; and the Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller told me, of what eſteem they were in <hi>England.</hi>— But they appeared to me as a fiery Serpent, by which I had been mortally ſtung; and had I not looked to Chriſt, as the Iſraelites did to the brazen Serpent, my Soul muſt have died of the Wound.</p>
            <p>And I ſuppoſe this to be one Reaſon why Election ſeems ſo ſweet to me now, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually running in my Mind; even becauſe of my blaſphemous quarrelling in the Day of Temptation. Like the proud <hi>Legaliſts,</hi> who, while <hi>Paul</hi> was preaching Chriſt and free Grace, are ſaid to <hi>ſpeak againſt thoſe Things, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting and blaſpheming:</hi> But the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were ſo far from giving over when they were thus oppoſed, that it is ſaid in the next Verſe, <hi>They waxed bold</hi> &amp;c. and then it follows; <hi>As
<pb n="8"
                      facs="unknown:004166_0008_1003F2FA73A86938"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>
many as were ordained to eternal Life, believed.</hi>— Thus my falling out with that ſweet Doctrine, has renewed and increaſed my Love to it:— And I muſt again expreſs my humble Deſire and Wiſh, that Miniſters might be moved, — But I forbear.— I have oppoſed and ſlighted them in the cloudy and dark Day of Temptation, and am not worthy to ſpeak to them: —Yet may I ſpeak to God for them, and deſire their Prayers, and the Prayers of all the Lord's choſen and called,— who may come to know my Caſe, ſtill continuing gloomy; neither ſo dark as it has been, nor ſo light as I hope in God's Time it may be.</p>
