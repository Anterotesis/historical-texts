            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<q>The Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Love of God, and the Communion of the Holy Ghoſt, be with you all always. Amen.<note n="‖" place="bottom">2 Cor. xiii. 14.</note>
               </q>
It is the conſtant language of that evangelical ſpirit, from which ariſes this tribute of
<q>Glory to God in the higheſt, peace on earth, good-will to men<note n="†" place="bottom">Luke ii. 14.</note>,</q>
and which I am thankful to feel not reſtrained within leſs compaſs than the Bulk of Mankind; but zealouſly and ardently pointing towards all ſuch as profeſs faith in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and a hope of ſalvation by him.</p>

               <p>THERE is no language, or form of words, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently copious and expreſſive, though raiſed to the utmoſt extent or height of deſcription, for repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the adorable manifeſtations of heavenly kindneſs, goodneſs, condeſcenſion and mercy, or for exhibiting the things which proceed from the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: but it is allowable to ſpeak whereof we know, according to the Meaſure of knowledge, and to utter, according to the proportion of Strength given, what we now ſee in part, and what from experience we feel, of the merciful kindneſs of God; and which, as we faithfully follow his will, we ſhall hereafter more fully and comprehenſively behold.—This I apprehend is neceſſary for all, to whom a revelation of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion has been made by means of Holy Writ; and in an eſpecial manner, where He that is the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer of ſtates, has opened their underſtandings to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Doctrines of the Chriſtian Religion, and the ſacred records of that miraculous Favour and Grace that came by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="unknown:012046_0004_0F896F85F7A5E150"/>BUT for my own part, I muſt freely acknowledge there was a time of my life, in which I would gladly have relieved myſelf from following the arduous paths of religion, by turning aſide into the paths of Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm and Infidelity. My mind was ready to alledge, as ſome at this time of day may be,
<q>How can we believe without Evidence? There is not a ſufficient Evidence of Truth to convince my judgment, or to induce me to believe.</q>
I know this has been the allegation of ſome: But I have found there is no Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of evidence, but an unwillingneſs to admit the Force of that evidence, which would properly influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the mind; and I have reaſon to apprehend this has been the caſe with others: for if there was a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough ſubmiſſion, and diſpoſition of mind to receive the Truth in the Love of it; to endeavour after it in its genuine ſimplicity; to look at it with a ſingle eye; and, if I may be allowed the expreſſion, to ſuppreſs or baniſh all the <hi>"buts</hi> and <hi>iſs;"</hi> we ſhould ſoon find the Evidence of the Chriſtian Religion to be lively and inconteſtible, and effectually to operate to make us wiſe and good; Wiſe with the Wiſdom that is to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and Good, with the Goodneſs that is of God, the Source of Goodneſs.</p>
               <p>BUT whilſt people "take counſel, and not of God," and ſuffer themſelves to be
<q>covered with a covering and not of his Spirit<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſaiah xxx. 1.</note>,</q>
they are unwilling to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the force of thoſe truths which would
<q>ſeparate the precious from the vile," and purify us accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his word.</q>
—While this is the caſe that many deviate in point of Faith, they may complain of the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012046_0005_0F896F86B7BD2A40"/>
want of Evidence, reſpecting the Certainty and Truth of the Chriſtian Religion; and complain with as much juſtice, as a man who wilfully hides himſelf in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, complains of his Incapacity of Seeing. For we have <hi>ſuch</hi> an evidence and underſtanding imparted by the Light and Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as doubtleſs abundantly diſplays the immediate Regard and Love of God, as recorded in Holy Writ; and from which I freely acknowledge an internal illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>neceſſary,</hi> for all that would have valid claim to the Chriſtian Religion; whereby we obtain a firm aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of, and a well-grounded belief in, thoſe glorious truths.</p>
               <p>WE have ſometimes been accuſed of allegorizing away the important truths of the Chriſtian Religion as recorded in Holy Writ: It is far, very far from our intention or inclination! We want to <hi>inforce</hi> them, upon ourſelves, upon our brethren, with all that requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite weight which commands their belief; calling to a belief of <hi>Heart,</hi> not a mere aſſent with the Tongue; but "a belief of Heart unto righteouſneſs<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. x. 10.</note>."</p>
               <p>WE have been diſtinguiſhed, and are not aſhamed of the diſtinction, for preaching, "Chriſt within;" but we never preach a Chriſt within, oppoſed to, or derogating from, a Chriſt <hi>without.</hi>—We fully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not only in his glorious and gracious appearance amongſt the ſons of men, "as in the volume of the book it is written<note n="†" place="bottom">Heb. x. 7.</note>;" but we alſo believe in his inward and ſpiritual appearance,
<q>the ſecond time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin unto ſalvation<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. ix. 28.</note>;</q>
in which we are ſupported by a cloud of witneſſes<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ibid. xii. 1.</note>, and by the doctrine of the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012046_0006_0F896F87807493C0"/>
holy Author of the Chriſtian Religion, inforcing his inward and ſpiritual manifeſtation (the manifeſtation of his Grace) in as clear and indubitable a manner, as from the teſtimonies delivered concerning his external appearance.</p>
               <p>BUT the myſtery of ungodlineſs hath powerfully wrought with ſome who profeſs the Chriſtian name, in oppoſition to the force of thoſe teſtimonies with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to his internal appearance, or manifeſtation of himſelf in the hearts of mankind; and to render inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſible the doctrine of an inward and ſpiritual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, the revelation of Light, Life, and Good to the ſouls of men, immediately imparted for our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſanctification.—This would lead people home from the flowery paths of Eaſe and Speculation, into the arduous one of Practice: It would transfer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion from the <hi>Head</hi> to the <hi>Heart;</hi> and, in its progreſs, would remove every obſtacle to the admiſſion of the doctrine of an inward and ſpiritual manifeſtation of the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>BUT there hath been a lamentable defection from the Life and Spirit of true chriſtianity, wherein the Old Man, under all the pomp of Opinion, and aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to indubitable Truths, ſtill remains in full poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of every inordinate love, and his goods are at eaſe. A mind diſguiſed with JACOB'S Voice, and ESAU'S Hands, found orthodox Principles, with a ſchiſmatic Heart, ingroſs the Formaliſt of all names and diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to religion; the old man being at eaſe with his goods, in a ſtate of ſelf-ſufficiency, either rejoicing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Form, and the falſe ſhade of Opinion and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of conduct, or in the pomp of a ſpecious external
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012046_0007_0F896F88361CB8E0"/>
appearance; wherein ſome continue poſſeſſed of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy tranquillity or eaſe of mind, and are endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to build up a tabernacle quiet and ſafe, content with a Form, or depending upon a bare Belief in the doctrines of the chriſtian religion.—But there is a work whereby the <hi>Old</hi> Earth, and the <hi>Old</hi> Heavens are made to <hi>ſhake,</hi> and muſt be removed; which is of the ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able mercy and grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, when he thus may reveal himſelf;—</p>
               <p>
                  <q>YET once more will I ſhake not the Earth only, but alſo HEAVEN <note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. xii. 27.</note>!</q>
—Not only the Earth, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the inhabitants of the earth; but the Work of God is made conſpicuous in the Awakening of the ungodly, for their converſion from ſin and death, unto righteouſneſs and life.— "Yet once more will I ſhake HEAVEN!"—The glorious ſpecious Appearances of Truth, and Doctrines recorded and aſſented to, but yet not reduced to Experience; truths received and confeſſed by the Tongue, but the Heart revolting from their efficacious influence.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Yet once more will I ſhake not the Earth only, but alſo Heaven.</q>
And this word, yet once <hi>more,</hi> ſignifies the REMOVING of thoſe things which are ſhaken. And undoubtedly the Grace of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, in its manifeſtation, procedure and effects, would ſhake <hi>every</hi> falſe reſt in which any deluded ſoul may have fixed its repoſe: He would ſhake every falſe reſt among thoſe under all names and diſtinctions to religion, who are truſting in <hi>Name</hi> and in <hi>Form,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the POWER, or an experience of its virtual effects
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012046_0008_0F896F89B9D271C8"/>
upon the ſoul; theſe all appertain to one family:—and not only ſo, but he would ſhake every falſe reſt, yea and the FOUNDATION, of thoſe who are building upon a <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> and upon the Apoſtles <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt; becauſe they are only building upon the <hi>Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> of thoſe truths, yet cannot experimentally ſay, Through the Grace of our Lord Jeſus,
<q>We acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Truth, according to Godlineſs<note n="†" place="bottom">Titus i. 1.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THEY that are of the World, come here alſo to a houſe fortified with <hi>Opinion,</hi> and are ſupporting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in having obtained a clear, full, and conciſe knowledge of the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion. But there is a Power that will ſearch every <hi>falſe foundation,</hi> and overturn every ſuperficial dependence on Human Production, that is inconſiſtent with the uniform ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of his ſacred Law, faſhioned upon the plan of unchangeable, everlaſting Wiſdom.—It is not of Man, or by Man, but proceeds from the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whereby thoſe truths are brought home to the Hearts of mankind. The gracious effects of his powerful working, are manifeſted to bring us home from a ſtate of falſe dependence, that we may humbly and experientially acknowledge,
<q>In God is my Salvation, and my Glory, the Rock of my Strength<note n="‡" place="bottom">Pſal. lxii. 7.</note>: in God alone is my Truſt.</q>
               </p>

This is the Redemption propoſed by the Goſpel, which commands our aſſent, and will remain obligatory throughout all ages of the Chriſtian diſpenſation.</p>

In this ſtate of anxious ſolicitude, your heavenly Father is mercifully pleaſed to ariſe, and adminiſter relief to ſuch, who are thus "hungering and thirſting after righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;" and the cup of life and ſalvation is handed to their comfort, from the glorious Helper, that in his ſtrength you may be enabled to ſtand unſhaken in the troublous time!—And it is to theſe he waits to be gracious; a helper at hand, from whom proceeds every power to aſſiſt, and every attribute of mercy, kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, goodneſs, and adorable condeſcenſion, are graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly diſpenſed to the ſons of men, wherein they are eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſs and true holineſs.</p>
               <p>"HE touches the mountains, and they melt:" every obſtruction that would hinder the progreſs or advancement of this divine, eſſential, efficacious work of redemption upon the ſoul, muſt be removed; every unavailing connexion muſt give place to the ties of an ardent and ſanctified Love.</p>

                  <q>HE touches the mountains, and they melt; the everlaſting hills, they bow at his preſence.</q>
In his mercy we experience the removing of thoſe things, that oppoſe or prevent an increaſe in the knowledge of God, or of the things appertaining to our everlaſting peace; in order that the exerciſed pilgrim in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs may receive additional ſtrength, to run with alacrity the race of a chriſtian life, and finally attain an happy union with the ſons of the morning, who ſing together for joy.</p>
               <p>IT is the glorious benefits proceeding from the Love of God, which I earneſtly intreat that the youth, of all names and diſtinctions to religion, may carefully ſeek, and avail yourſelves of, that HE may be with you through the various ſteps of a probationary life. And though you may ſometimes have to travel in the exerciſed path of temptation and anxious diſtreſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in <hi>hope,</hi> and you will feel his LIGHT to ariſe in your hearts, and witneſs an inward reſurrection unto LIFE; that Life that will never fade, but will remain, when every tender and lawful connexion can no longer comfort, but muſt ſoon be diſſolved, and the ſympathy one for another ſhall be ineffectual to deliver. All the tender connexions in life are but of uncertain dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and upon them all this inſcription is wrote, "They ſhall ſhortly periſh;" but the LOVE of GOD <hi>never fades:</hi>—It is continued from generation to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and will remain when Time ſhall be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in Eternity:—It is this wherein we taſte of the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of God, and are made to drink the cup of life and ſalvation, and have to rejoice in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable fruition of happineſs it affords to the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified

               <p>HE knows ALL things, by whoſe merciful aid we are ſuſtained through "the Regions of the ſhadow of Death," when every unavailing relation or human de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency ſhall diſappear and come to an end. What <hi>then,</hi> can ſuſtain us, but the Love of God?—It is that which covers the head in the day of battle; and which I would recommend, with a fervent affection, to you who are the hopes of the preſent age, that you ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently endeavour after the Love of God, that will never decreaſe with age; it enlarges upon the mind, and is increaſed with an increaſe of Love: It proceeds from the THRONE of God, and ſpreads from the Threſhold of his Houſe: It is continued through the Courts of his Sanctuary, and reaches to the Uttermoſt Part of the Earth; and is as a
<q>RIVER, the Streams whereof make glad the whole Heritage of God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>ALL the beauty and ſplendor of the world will fade; and the excellency of temporal enjoyments, which are the portion of uncertainty, ſhall ſhortly know their time and place no more: But the Love of God, flowing from Himſelf, returns upon the ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſoul as a River that never <hi>paſſeth by,</hi> proceeding from the inexhauſtible SOURCE of Love: it ſpreads through the various ſtates of mankind, and is diffuſed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

the ſpiritual creation of his Son, unlimited as Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity! A degree of which I feel upon my mind for this aſſembly, with an ardency that cannot be expreſſed, "that He may be with you All, always. Amen!"— For the Love of God imparted to the ſanctified Soul, and a portion of the Holy Ghoſt, and Divine Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation in Communion, hath been ſuch, as
<q>Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive the good things that God hath in ſtore for them that love him.</q>

               <p>THIS is the bond that binds, and wherein we are united to God, and know it, to be a well ſpringing up unto Eternal Life.—It is not in external Helps, nor in the Agreement of Words, neither is it in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Doctrine, or in fine-ſpun regular Syſtems, to conſtitute a "Communion of the Holy Ghoſt." But it is as we are admitted to a ſacred repaſt in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine "Banquetting-houſe," (wherein we offer the oblation of Worſhip, a Cloud of Incenſe, ariſing from hearts prepared by the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and in the Love of God,) that we are advanced to a divine Communion of the Holy Ghoſt. A commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion not reſtrained to any Diſtinction or Profeſſion of People, but extended to all ſuch as experience an union and fellowſhip in Spirit, wherein they are ſometimes lifted up to the Father of ſpirits, and enabled to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him "in Spirit and in Truth;" which has often been ſealed with the Love and Approbation of God, in a divine manifeſtation of his kindneſs and

               <p>IN this Communion, this unutterable, this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable Communion, many have found their
<q>Strength to be renewed,</q>
and their Hearts engaged in the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Worſhip of God, the Author of their being: A communion inexpreſſible in its nature!—May thoſe minds, who have attained this happy experience, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue therein in all humility and purity!</p>
               <p>IT is a Communion in <hi>Spirit,</hi> wherein the ſanctified ſoul approaches the Author of ſpirits with a Sacrifice in ſpirit, when the ſacrifice of Words ſhall fail.—For there is a Communion which Language cannot <hi>expreſs!</hi> A Worſhip that wants not the aid of <hi>Words,</hi> nor is to be defined by an Harmony of Sounds, in which we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the ſacred Author of unutterable Love!</p>
               <p>WHEN there was

when the Vocal Tribute of "Holy, Holy, Holy," and the Hallelujahs of ſanctified Spirits in endleſs felicity were ſuſpended, their <hi>Worſhip</hi> continued in awful, holy, ſolemn, inconceivable SILENCE! It was a Rapturous Adoration, too copious for Language to expreſs! A Cloud of Incenſe, before the Throne of immaculate Purity and Love!—May our minds be gathered to it, let our Name or profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to Religion be what it may! and may we experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence this Divine Communion of Saints, and deeply ponder God's unbounded Love, in ſolemn Silence!
