            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>THIS</hi> Address was calculated only for the minute. The idea of publication was not admitted by the author at the time of composing it. But an injunction which was not to be resisted, controuled a different resolution. A vivid expression was sought for to conceal its defects, and to agree with the fes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of the Season. As great candour as was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered at the delivery will be indispensable to make it sufferable in the closet.</p>

            <head>AN ADDRESS, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IN the complete possession of PEACE, LI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BERTY and SAFETY, we are now assembled, <hi>my beloved Countrymen,</hi> to celebrate the Birth-day of our Nation.â€”A Day sacred to Freedom and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant Patriotism! A Day, which sixteen years since, the boldest heart and most illumined mind had not anticipated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>AMERICANS!</hi> YE are now convened, not, in adulatory strains, to hail the nativity of a vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious master, but to commemorate the glorious Epoch that gave ye a Government of Laws and not of Men; and while your souls dilate at the joyful festival, ye will recollect those ties which bind ye to your Country; and, with sincerity, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterate
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:022947_0004_0FBAC50E260CF398"/>
those virtuous resolutions, that strengthen, while they brighten the chain of union that has now ranked us with the Nations of the earth.</p>
            <p>TO ascertain the precise time, under the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of a CECIL or a CHATHAM, when <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> and her Colonies must have separated, might afford amusement to a speculative inquirer, but can be of no utility now.â€”That the crisis was precipitated is concededâ€”But it was not the des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potic statutes of Englandâ€”It was not the haughty and fastidious manners of her officers, civil or military, which compelled the mighty Revolution which severed her Empire. These did rouse, but they could not create that unconquerable spirit which stimulated America to vindicate, and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocably to fix those rights, which distance, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther causes, might, for ages, have kept indefinite, dependent and precarious.â€”Noâ€”it was that native servid sense of Freedom which our enlightened an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors brought with them and fostered in the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests of <hi>America</hi>; and which, with pious care, they taught their offspring never to forego. Although the present age cannot forget, and posterity shall learn to remember those violences which impelled
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:022947_0005_0FBAC50F7337DCB8"/>
their country to war, yet it must be admitted that the period of parting had arrived. British influence, and foreign arts, might have corrupted, silenced, or destroyed that spirit, which, thus early outraged, became invincible, gave birth to the immortal Edict, and all those glorious circumstances in which we this day rejoice.</p>
            <p>WHOLE Oceans rolled between, yet the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies retained a strong attachment to their parent state. The numerous memorials transmitted from every Province to that infatuated Country, remain the evidence of their patience and affection:â€”But deaf to the voice of supplication, and aloof to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty, she added indignity to wrong, until
"hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility was tort<gap reason="illegible: obscured" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>red into rage."
â€”Oppression crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon oppression, until submission was criminal and resistance became an obligation. On this aus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious day, and through every revolving year, the magnanimity exhibited by our country at that all-interesting and momentous crisis, shall cheer the patriot mind, and raise a glow of honest pride. She neither hesitated nor halted, but sacrificing her attachments at the shrine of dutyâ€”appealed GOD and to her sword, for justice and success;â€”
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:022947_0006_0FBAC511392706F8"/>
Heaven approbated the appealâ€”invigorated her councils, and pointed the road to victoryâ€”That sword which she drew by compulsion, she wore with honour, and, her enemies have confessed, that she sheathed it without revenge.</p>
            <p>IN this eventful struggle, many sacrifices were to be made that came near the heart; and if, to day, your affections are called out, for the loss of Fathers, Friends, and Brothers, check not the tear, for it is the tear of virtue. Your consolation is, that thus falling, they greatly discharged the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verest duty of men and citizens. I mean not here to traverse with you the plains of death, nor to resuscitate the sorrows of the tomb. The altars of Liberty require many victims.â€”Those patriot soldiers devoted their lives to our safety; their deaths extended the publick fame; and may the gratitude of their country be immortal.</p>
            <p>THE talents and integrity of those Statesmen who conceived and directed the measures which broke the yoke of foreign sway, cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated without admiration. The thunders of Albion in vain poured forth their terrors: The
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:022947_0007_0FBAC5128719E6D0"/>
collected vengeance of Britain menaced but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire. Depravity could find no lurking place, and venality dared not approach the steeled breasts of men who sought a hallowed fame in the rescue of millions from distant tyranny. Posterity must often recall the names of those deliverers, and in copying their bright examples pursue the surest road to substantial glory.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>NOTE.</p>
                  <p>It will not be invidious, perhaps, in this illustrious Group, to distinguish the two characters whom the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have delighted to honour. It certainly augured well to the new, united Government, that in their first setting out they bestowed the first posts of honour and trust upon their two most meritorious and efficient citizens. The suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful negotiation with Holland, and the definitive treaty of Paris will forever endear the name of JOHN ADAMS to the People of America. And his invaluable services at home, and in Europe, continue to be remembered as long as gratitude shall be thought a virtue.</p>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>IT is not enough, my Countrymen, that the decisive fiat we this day consecrate, became a record in Heaven; It is not enough, that victory and peace secured and confirmed our rights: It is not enough, that the United States embrace a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory equal in extent to the Roman World: It is not enough, that in our Federal and State Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:022947_0008_0FBAC514047A02E8"/>
we boast the freest Governments on earth:â€” It yet remains to perfect and establish the true principles of social Life, Laws, Agriculture, Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, with all the Arts that ameliorate and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the human species.</p>
            <p>DURING the arduous contest, the arms of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica were borne by men who had a country to love, a property to defend, and a share in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacting laws which it was their interest as well as duty to maintain. Tranquility restored, with joy her soldiers became retired citizens. War is the disgrace and calamity of human nature: And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever distant be the day in this country, when it shall be encouraged as an art, and be debased into a trade.</p>
            <p>AND here, <hi>My dear Associates!</hi> Permit an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress which may be construed as an apology that your Institution most assuredly does not want.â€” The society hath been faulted by those who never saw its rules, or knowing have misconstrued them. Canons which inculcate
"the duty of laying down in Peace arms assumed for the publick defence."
But</p>
            <l>"Perish the narrow Thought, the sland'rous Tongue,</l>
            <l>"Where the Heart's right, the Action can't be wrong."</l>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:022947_0009_0FBAC515786F9608"/>TO the generous sense of a grateful Country, your APPEAL has been made: And do I mistake? Or do I hear that Country exclaimâ€”<hi>By the Toils which cemented your Friendshipsâ€”by the dangers encountered in the fair Fields of Fightâ€”by the Blood of our slaughtered, faithful Sons, who so greatly thought, and nobly daredâ€”by the merits of our</hi> WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TONâ€”<hi>we swear! that ye have not offended.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MOST honourable would be the retrospect, and pleasant the employment, to retrace our infant Country through the scenes of warfare, and to mark her conduct under alternate Victory and Retreat, did not such a task more properly become the Historian, than comport with this occasion. It is enough to say, she sustained misfortune with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancyâ€”collected, she met Independence and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigntyâ€”She triumphed, but she did not insult.</p>
            <p>THE five succeeding years of Peace, important as they were, passed neglected; and, flying, left an unfortunate blank in her annals. National wisdom in most countries hath been slow, in all progressive. America, springing from the cradle of Empire, had much to learn; and every thing, in national legis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:022947_0010_0FBAC5174BF1A9B8"/>
politicks, to experiment. Those jealousies which had been so long encouraged as political wisdom;â€”the recent escape from the abuses of monarchical establishments; and a too fond adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to local rule; all combined to retard that efficient and united policy, which alone could have exalted our nation, while it would have equally dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seminated all the blessings of the social compact. The humiliating situation was at length surmounted, and we now enjoy a system of confederated, or rather CONSOLIDATED<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>NOTE.</p>
                  <p>"In all our deliberations on this subject, we kept stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily in our view, that which appears to us, the greatest interest of every true American, the <hi>Consolidation of our Union,</hi> in which is involved our prosperity, felicity, safety, perhaps, our national existence. This important considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, seriously and deeply impressed on our minds, led each State in the Convention, to be less rigid on points of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior magnitude, than might have been otherwise expected; and thus the Constitution, which we now present, is the result of a spirit of amity, and of that mutual deference and concession which the peculiarity of our political situation rendered indispensable."
<hi>(Letter from the Federal Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the President of Congress.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whoever has read and considered the Constitution of the United States, can be at no loss to know where lies the Sovereignty of our Nation. With Congress is deposited the exclusive Power of making Peace and War, forming Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, coining Money, raising and supporting Armies and a Navy, calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish Rules of Naturalization, Laws of Bankruptcies, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Our National Government has sometimes, <hi>but most improperly,</hi> been called a Federal Republick; for a Federal Republick is an association of a number of independent <hi>sovereign</hi> States. Unanimity is essential to a Federal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, because each State possesses sovereign powers. But unanimity is not necessary according to our National Constitution; and it would be ruinous to have made it so. The greatest Civilians have all agreed that the <hi>summa Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perii</hi> is indivisible. That the <hi>Imperium in Imperio</hi> is a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecism. And history and experience have made that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion oracular. Although there exists in some instances a militation between the National and State Governments, yet it is presumed, for the reasons offered, that the expression is true, and that we must be considered as a CONSOLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DATED, and not a confederated Republick.</p>
               </note> government, which honestly
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:022947_0011_0FBAC5189FD8BD90"/>
conducted, must command respect abroad, and ought to produce contentment at home.</p>
            <p>OUR public officers are the accountable ministers of the lawsâ€”our legislative servants return and mingle, at short periods, with their fellow-citizens. With caution elect, but the delegation once com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, let us not with-hold a generous confidence in our Rulers. With candour pass upon their deliberations, and with manly patience await the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:022947_0012_0FBAC51CB2F355C0"/>
beneficial consequences, presumed to flow from their public acts. Many discordant interests, are to be accommodated.â€”Character, attachment, the desire of securing future honours, all the views that stimulate the human heart, press upon the public servants to a faithful discharge of their national duties. The present ought, therefore, to be the period of trust, not of suspicion, still less of aspersion. AMERICANS! Ye have fought the battles of mankindâ€”ye have here enkindled that sacred flame of Freedom, which is now expand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its warmth, and dispersing its beams, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a great part of Europe:â€”Do not then suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer precipitation and intemperance to defeat the just expectations of the wise and the good, who have so often, although so vainly, in most coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, dared to advocate the rights of man. But may your conduct and your history demonstrate, that a government, free as your own, may be maintained without turbulence, administered with energy and dignity, and while it advances the happiness of all its subjects, can extend the glory of their Empire.</p>
