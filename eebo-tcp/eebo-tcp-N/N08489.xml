            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>And next him was Amaſiah the ſon of Zichri, who willingly offered himſelf unto the LORD, and with him two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand mighty men of valour.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT GOD, the ſource of being and perfection, who created all things for himſelf, exerciſes a wiſe, a juſt, an univerſal government and providence over all his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and all his works, is a truth too evident, from the light of nature, to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, too clearly revealed, explained and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the ſacred oracles, to need any proof.</p>
            <p>THAT this world and all that is in it, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his direction and government,—that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind have been his peculiar care, the experience of all preceeding ages abundantly proves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:010856_0004_0F8C690CED830040"/>TO lead mankind to ſee the juſtice and equity of divine government, to give a general idea of the courſe of divine providence, towards ſtates and kingdoms, as well as individuals, is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one important end of <hi>all</hi> hiſtory, whether ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred or profane. And as the divine conduct has been generally the ſame, to people of the ſame temper and character, in all paſt ages of the world, <hi>facts</hi> and <hi>events,</hi> truly recorded and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully preſerved in hiſtory, are of no ſmall advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to ſucceeding generations.—They happily point out the errors into which ſome have run, and the rocks upon which they have been ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck'd,—they clearly exhibit the meaſures by which others have roſe to a ſtate of glory and happineſs, ſcarcely to be conceived of, in a ſtate of imperfection; and ſo give the wiſdom and experience of ages paſt, for the direction and improvement of thoſe that ſucceed.</p>
            <p>AMONG the various hiſtories with which the world has been favoured, as none is of earlier date, none is furniſhed with events, or examples, more intereſting, entertaining, or uſeful, than the <hi>Scriptures of Truth.</hi> — Here we have a moſt ſimple, familiar, and (yet) ſtriking repreſentation of the conduct of the ſupreme ruler of the world, towards his ſaints and ſervants—towards his choſen people and their immediate enemies, and towards the world of mankind.—Here we have (as far as is neceſſary for us to know) the grounds and reaſons of the divine conduct, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards nations and kingdoms, and individuals, together with the ends propoſed by providence therein. And there is ſcarcely any thing men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:010856_0005_0F8C690DC1E0F500"/>
in ſacred hiſtory, but what is of public uſe, or private inſtruction—adapted to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and encourage vertue, in the good, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and diſcountenance vice, in the abandon'd and profane.</p>
            <p>THE part of ſacred writ, which has now been read, with the paſſage of hiſtory with which it is connected, preſents us with a ſcene of meaſures, truly worthy the character of thoſe that purſued them, and ſuited, at once, to engage the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, excite the admiration and encourage the emulation of perſons of the ſame character and ſtations in life.</p>
            <p>THE paſſage gives account of <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi>'s acceſſion to the throne of <hi>Judah,</hi> and of the meaſures taken, by him and his loyal people, to ſtrengthen him againſt his enemies, to confirm him in his kingdom, and to render his reign eaſy to himſelf and happy to his people.</p>
            <p>THE latter part of the preceeding reign, had been clouded with ſeveral inſtances of weak and bad policy, quite unworthy a king, whoſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral character had been really great and good:— By reaſon of which, the kingdom was left in a ſtate, ſomewhat broken and perplex'd.—No ſooner was <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> ſeated on the throne, but his care was to ſet things right in the kingdom, and put the ſtate into a poſture of defence.—<hi>He placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and ſet garriſons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Context ver. 2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:010856_0006_0F8C690E6DC3E1A0"/>THE method this wiſe king took to enſure ſucceſs to his meaſures, to lay a ſolid foundation for a proſperous, an happy reign, was <hi>greatly</hi> to his honour; worthy the <hi>wiſdom</hi> of a <hi>king,</hi> and is mentioned, and left, in ſacred ſtory, for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to others.—He began his reign with GOD, and early made <hi>religion</hi> his care.—<hi>He walked in the firſt ways of his father David, and ſought not unto Baalim: But ſought to the LORD GOD of his father, and walked in his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Cont. ver. 3, 4.</note>—In this, his pious care was not confined to himſelf alone,—his people quickly feel the happy influence hereof, and largely ſhare with him, in the benefits reſulting from ſo wiſe a ſtep.—Yea, the heart of this pious king was ſo encouraged, <hi>ſo lifted up in the ways of the LORD,</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. ver. 6.</note> that he took ſpeedy and effectual care, to reſtore the true worſhip of GOD to it's pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine ſtate, and have his people taught the law of the LORD, in it's native purity and ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city:—To the end, that, with him, they might taſte the ſweets of vertue, and know that GOD is good.</p>
            <p>THAT GOD, by whom <hi>kings reign</hi> and <hi>princes decree juſtice,</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Prov. 8.15.</note> quickly obſerves his conduct, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves his ſteps, rewards his pious care, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhes him in the kingdom. And, as an happy conſequence hereof, this excellent king is greatly beloved and rever'd by his ſubjects at home.—As an expreſſion of their loyalty and love, it is obſerved, that <hi>all Judah brought pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to Jehoſhaphat.</hi> By the ſame wiſe meaſures, the kingdom is rendred reſpectable abroad, and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:010856_0007_0F8C690F2AD42838"/>
a terror to it's enemies.—They are now glad to appear as tributaries to <hi>Judah,</hi> and making rich preſents to <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> to accept the terms of peace, at his hands. For <hi>the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah, ſo that they made no war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Jehoſhaphat.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Cont. ver. 10.</note>
            </p>
            <p>BUT, not enough that tranquility was reſtored and the kingdom in a reſpectable ſtate, this pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent king and this loyal people are for improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the happy opportunity of peace and reſt, more effectually to provide for every event.</p>
            <p>THE king, as he waxes great, continues to improve and provide for the ſafety, ſupport and defence of his people.—<hi>He built caſtles in Judah and cities of ſtone</hi>; <note n="†" place="bottom">Ver. 12.</note> and wiſely encouraged a martial ſpirit, and expertneſs in the knowledge and uſe of arms.—The people, whoſe hearts were united to their ſovereign, were far from being backward in ſo wiſe a meaſure. Men of the beſt character and greateſt influence, chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully follow the illuſtrious example, and, at the head of the thouſands of their brethren, appear in arms, to cultivate, to inform themſelves (more fully) in the art of war. <note n="‡" place="bottom">Vid. Cont. from ver. 14. to the end.</note>—And, by the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance they make, one would have thought, they were preparing to engage and oppoſe a moſt powerful enemy.—And yet, it was a time of peace!—No enemy nigh—None that dared to lift the finger, or move the tongue againſt them!—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:010856_0008_0F8C69101E937BF0"/>TO perſons unacquainted with the true cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and general conduct of mankind, in this ſtate of ſin and imperfection,—to ſuch as never ſtudied the rules, nor conſidered the importance of true policy, theſe meaſures might appear ſuperfluous, and all theſe preparations for ſafety and defence, but needleſs ſteps.— That, as peace and tranquility were reſtored, they might lay aſide arms, and give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up to eaſe and enjoyment.—That their only concern, was to reap the fruit of their toils, and taſte the ſweets of peace.</p>
            <p>THIS, indeed, has been the manner of moſt of the ſtates and nations, in the world.—Even the moſt warlike and politic,—nations that have been victorious in arms,—ſtates that have tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph'd in war, been the ſcourge of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and a terror to the world of mankind, have not been, always, able to reſiſt the force of ſo pleaſing a charm, or free themſelves from the effects of ſo fatal a miſtake.</p>
            <p>A MAN, or a people, muſt know but little of the true temper and diſpoſition of mankind,— but little of what has happened from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to ſtates and kingdoms, in conſequence of remiſſneſs, in times of peace and tranquility, not to ſee the wiſdom and neceſſity of ſuch provident ſteps,—not to know, that the moſt potent and reſpectable ſtate, in perfect tranquility and the height of proſperity, may ſoon be diſturbed, by it's enemies, and, if in a defenceleſs condition, quickly reduced to the greateſt diſtreſs,—to the brink of deſtruction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:010856_0009_0F8C6910A5193CF8"/>IN a ſtate of nature, every man has a right to liberty, property and life: And no one (unleſs injured, or in his own defence) can, reaſonably, deprive him of either.—Society is formed for the preſervation and defence of the common rights of mankind, to the end, that the bleſſings of life may be ſecured to all. The liberties and privileges, the property and poſſeſſions of ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ought always to be held ſacred; and no one is at liberty to invade, violate, or even incroach upon them, upon any pretence whatever.</p>
            <p>REASON and underſtanding were given, to teach men the unalterable difference between right and wrong, juſtice and injuſtice.—Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was implanted, in the human breaſt, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force to a behaviour, becoming the character of moral agents,—to excite to a conduct, towards others, agreable to the fitneſs of things, to the eternal rules of juſtice and equity; and to ſuch a treatment of all, as ſhould expreſs as ſacred a regard to the rights and liberties of others, as unto their own. And, to the ſame important purpoſes, was a divine revelation added, and the word of GOD given.—But—alas!—Reaſon and conſcience were too weak a reſtraint!—Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not found ſufficient to check, nor even the goſpel of our LORD, to ſubdue, <hi>the luſts and corruptions of men, from whence come wars and fightings</hi>! <note n="*" place="bottom">Jam. 4.1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>EARLY did the fatal effects of luſt and paſſion appear: And, from the time that <hi>Cain</hi> unjuſtly deprived his brother of life, down to the preſent
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010856_0010_0F8C691699BE4D30"/>
day, ſuch have been the depravity of human nature, and the power and prevalence of luſt and paſſion, that the greater part of mankind, have made it their chief concern, to invade the rights and live upon the ſpoils of others. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, avarice, revenge, and other ſordid luſts and paſſions, have governed the world, and made the earth a field of blood!—<hi>Wars, and rumours of wars, have been—Wars, and rumours of wars,</hi> will be, until the happy period commences, when
<q>the law ſhall go forth out of Zion, and the word of the LORD from Jeruſalem; when GOD ſhall judge among the nations, and ſhall rebuke many people: And they ſhall beat their ſwords into plow-ſhares, and their ſpears into pruning-hooks:</q>

            <p>IN the mean time, it is happy for mankind, that, partly from neceſſity, and partly for mutual ſafety and defence, they have been led, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, to form themſelves into ſocieties; to the end, that, as far as the preſent ſtate of things will admit, the evils, that might ariſe from a different ſtate, might be prevented, the natural and common rights of mankind preſerved, and the bleſſings, reſulting therefrom, more freely and univerſally enjoyed.</p>

every ſtep, conducive to this end, tends to the peace and happineſs of mankind.

            <p>AS it was now a time of peace and tranquility, with the kingdom of <hi>Judah,</hi> it is evident they could not have in view any immediate enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize againſt their enemies: They had none to encounter. An offenſive war (unleſs by ſpecial direction from heaven) could never be juſtified, upon principles of reaſon and equity: This could not, therefore, be the deſign of a king, who had made GOD his guide, and religion his care; or of a people who were taught the law of the

LORD, and had wiſely adopted it as the rule of their conduct. For theſe reaſons, it is natural to ſuppoſe, that, as to revive and encourage a truly martial ſpirit, and put the kingdom in the beſt ſtate of defence, were the ends immediately in view, martial exerciſes, and the cultivation of the uſe of weapons of defence, and of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the art of war, was the ſervice to which they offered themſelves; that, in this way, they might become a terror to their enemies, and keep them at a diſtance:—Or, if any ſhould dare to inſult, or diſturb their peace, they might meet with the fate they juſtly deſerved.</p>
            <p>AND, verily, this is a ſervice of no ſmall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to a nation, or a ſtate, to preſerve peace, when enjoy'd, as well as to reduce an enemy to reaſon and equitable terms of peace, when at war.—A ſervice, therefore, that ought, at all times, and by all ſtates, to have a proper attention paid unto it.</p>
            <p>WHEN once a martial ſpirit ſinks, and ſkill in military exerciſes and warlike accompliſhments are held in contempt, the art of war and uſe of arms neglected, among a people, they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the inſults of every invader, are an eaſy prey to their weakeſt enemies, and, like <hi>Laiſh</hi> of old, ſeem to be marked out, in providence, for ſpeedy deſtruction.

            <p>THE common father of mankind, who is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme LORD of all, graciouſly condeſcends to conſider his people, as his peculiar care, and their cauſe, as his own. Thoſe, who engage in the cauſe of his people, and ſet themſelves for their defence, are, therefore, to conſider themſelves as guardians and truſtees for GOD, having the rights, property, liberties and lives of their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-men (a ſacred truſt!—) committed to their charge; and by this conſideration, be excited to make devotion to God the principle, and love to him the ſpring of action. Piety to GOD, and principles of virtue and religion, lay the happieſt foundation for, and inſpire men with the moſt engaging and powerful motives to, the higheſt attainments and greateſt uſefulneſs, in every character, in life: But in none are they of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter importance, than in the character of thoſe, who, voluntarily, offer themſelves to the ſervice of mankind, for their protection and defence.</p>
            <p>LOVE to GOD, which contains the eſſence of religion, is a ſource of every virtue, every grace; and inſpires the ſoul with the nobleſt principles of action. From this divine root, ſprings that benevolence of heart, towards man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, which excites men, for the public good, for the ſafety and happineſs of ſociety, of their country, to ſacrifice any thing, every thing dear in life,—yea, life itſelf.—From this bleſſed

fountain, flows that humane, generous, benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent temper, towards our fellow men, that forms the <hi>truly public ſpirit</hi>—warms the heart with a tender, <hi>patriotic</hi> concern, and excites to a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful care, for the welfare of others, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and enjoyment of the common rights of mankind.</p>
            <p>FIRMLY to believe, fully to realize, deeply to be impreſs'd with, the great principles of piety to GOD, and, in the ſervices we engage in, for the good of mankind, to act as devoted to him;—to realize the being, perfections, govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and providence of GOD;—to act as under his immediate inſpection, and as accountable to him for every ſtep;—to remember, that the wiſe and virtuous, faithful and juſt, are aſſured of his favour, and that thoſe of an oppoſite cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, are expoſed to his diſpleaſure, and ſure of the ſevereſt reſentment of an angry GOD, muſt have the happieſt tendency, to ſtore the mind with the nobleſt ſentiments, and lead a man to act with the firmeſt reſolution and moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted views.</p>

mankind.—The frowns of the great, and the flatteries of the vulgar, are equally deſpiſed; the greateſt toils are chearfully endured, the moſt ſelf-denying ſervices are, with pleaſure, engaged in, in this cauſe of GOD. In honour to GOD, they wait on their king; in devotion to him, they ſerve their country, and for the glory of his name, ſtand ready, chearfully to ſubmit to every hardſhip, firmly to face every danger, and, for the ſupport of his cauſe and defence of the liberties and lives of his people, freely to make their own a ſacrifice, and ſhed their deareſt blood.

            <p>THUS the principles of piety lay the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for that excellent qualification, which was a peculiar characteriſtic virtue, in the men of <hi>Judah,</hi> who ſo chearfully offered themſelves unto the LORD, in the ſervice and for the defence of their king and country.—They are ſtiled <hi>mighty men of valour.</hi>

<pb n="19" facs="unknown:010856_0017_0F8C691E33EF70D0"/>
mind, of a manly, couragious and warlike ſpirit, able to endure the toil, and face the dangers of war, and prepared to bear the charge of an enemy, with becoming firmneſs and real forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.—A virtue, a qualification, of the greateſt importance to a ſoldier!—</p>
            <p>VALOUR, or true fortitude, is that virtue, by which men are enabled to preſerve preſence of mind, to poſſeſs themſelves fully, think clearly, judge wiſely and act with calmneſs, firmneſs and reſolution, in times of great confuſion and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, in the midſt of moſt preſſing dangers and perplexing diſtreſſes. A virtue which excites to the nobleſt actions, ſtimulates to the boldeſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes, which reaſon dictates, judgment di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects, or duty calls them to engage in.—But, then, it is carefully to be diſtinguiſhed from raſhneſs, preſumption, fury and madneſs; which, in conſequence of falſe notions of this virtue, or ſucceſs attending ſuch unnatural and unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble exertions, too often gain applauſe, and take the name of Valour. But the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, is very great,—the ſame as between reaſon and paſſion, ſound judgment and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>TRUE <hi>Valour</hi> is, therefore, to be conſidered as a moral virtue, having reaſon for it's founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and religion for it's encouragement and ſupport. And where courage, valour or forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, has reaſon for it's baſis, and is encouraged, cultivated and ſupported, by the principles of religion, it becomes a virtue of the higheſt rank, and prompts and leads men on to the moſt he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roic
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:010856_0018_0F8C691EE57EE468"/>
undertakings: And when properly called, in a cauſe worthy their attention, it enables men, with calmneſs and compoſure of mind, to face the greateſt dangers, to ſtand the ſevereſt ſhocks, to meet, undaunted and ſerene, the charge of the moſt formidable enemy, and all the horrors of war.</p>
            <p>THE want of true fortitude, is always attended with diſgrace and reproach, frequently with ſhameful defeats, and ſometimes with total de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. But, inſpired with this virtue, a man may engage the boldeſt rival, in arms, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the moſt glorious exploits.</p>
            <p>NUMBERLESS are the inſtances, of the amazing effects of this eminent virtue, as founded in, and exerciſed upon, the principles of reaſon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which are celebrated in the hiſtory of ages paſt.—The ſacred pages exhibit a liſt of the moſt <hi>valiant Heroes,</hi> whoſe virtue and piety, inſpiring them with true fortitude of ſoul, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted them to the higheſt pitch of honour, and led and enabled them to perform the moſt il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious deeds.

            <p>INSPIRED with the ſame ſentiments, which influenced to, and governed the meaſures of <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> and his <hi>people,</hi> for mutual ſafety, felicity and protection;—to enjoy the bleſſings of liberty, civil and religious, with greater ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; our <hi>fathers,</hi> in <hi>ſeverer reigns,</hi> left a pleaſant land, and, at the riſk of their lives, ſought a ſafe retreat, from <hi>arbitrary power,</hi> among mercileſs <hi>ſavages,</hi> in this inhoſpitable wilderneſs.

            <p>EARLY did the firſt ſettlers of this country diſcover a due concern, a provident care, for themſelves and poſterity, in making the beſt proviſion in their power, for ſafety and defence. No ſooner was ſociety formed and civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment eſtabliſhed, but, even in their infant ſtate, they made it their care, to put the <hi>militia</hi> of the country upon a reſpectable footing.</p>
            <p>VARIOUS were the inſtitutions, for this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant purpoſe.—Like <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> the <hi>chief rulers</hi> made the defence of their country, and the ſafety of the people, an object of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant

and cloſeſt attention; and by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and influence, and in every wiſe and laudable way, endeavoured to inſpire the people with a martial ſpirit, and excite them to excel in military ſkill, the uſe of arms and art of war.— They often honour'd them with their preſence, in the military exerciſes, and did not look upon it beneath their dignity, ſometimes, to appear in arms themſelves.

Perſons of the beſt character and eſtates, chearfully followed, and, with the multitude of their brethren, <hi>willingly offered themſelves to the LORD,</hi> in this important ſervice.</p>
            <p>TO theſe purpoſes and for theſe important ends, the <hi>Honorable Artillery Company</hi> was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſoon after the ſettlement of the country;— to be a ſchool for military exerciſe and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline;—to teach and inſtruct in martial ſkill and the art of war.—Great have been the benefits reſulting from ſuch a wiſe deſign. Many brave captains and leaders have gone out from hence, that have done worthily for GOD and their country.—The primary deſign, of this early care of the fathers of the country, for military ſkill and warlike accompliſhments, is happily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. After a long ſeries of hardſhips, toils, dangers and diſtreſſes of cruel wars, with the common enemy, who were our rivals in <hi>America,</hi> and the barbarous, mercileſs <hi>ſavages,</hi> whoſe thirſt for blood and revenge has always been inſatiable, through the ſmiles of heaven, we ſee this happy land in a ſtate of peace and reſt.—But ſtill, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures

Such an inſtitution, therefore, even in the preſent happy ſtate of peace and quiet, is of no ſmall importance; as, properly attended to, it may anſwer many valuable purpoſes, ſerve as a ſpring to a martial ſpirit, excite others to emulation, and happily encourage thoſe exerciſes, which greatly tend to the protection and ſafety of this people.</p>
            <p>TO honour and countenance an inſtitution, ſo well calculated for the public good, Gentlemen of the higheſt character and firſt places of truſt and government among us, have chearfully at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended on theſe occaſions:—And it is with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar joy we behold the COMMANDER in CHIEF, and <hi>firſt Magiſtrates</hi> of the province<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> attending the ſervices of this day;—to expreſs their readineſs to countenance and diſpoſition to encourage ſo worthy a deſign.— In this, they have the example of one of the beſt of kings, and of the princes and chiefs of a moſt reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtate, to countenance them.</p>

            <p>TOO often has it happened, that ſtates, which have been ſucceſsful in war, given law to their enemies and triumphed in arms, by negligence in this point, have been reduced to defenceleſs condition and eaſily ſubjected to the power of thoſe, who, but a little while before, were bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at their feet and gladly ſubmitting to any terms they preſcribed.—How unhappy, how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious would it be, after the remarkable ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, with which heaven has bleſſed our arms, and when peace is reſtored, and all means of ſafety and defence are put into our hands, ſhould this be our folly and fate?—How ſhould we, with tears of grief, of ſhame and remorſe, lament (too late) our ſtupidity, &amp; curſe the indolent ſpirit that poſſeſſed us?—Yea, how juſtly will poſterity, in ages to come, riſe up and curſe us, as the cauſes of their wretchedneſs, and the authors of the miſery, to which they are doomed, without the hope or poſſibility of redreſs!—</p>

               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:010856_0025_0F8C692B8626C888"/>MAY the characters, that have been preſented us, inſpire us with a different ſpirit,—and a due concern for the honour of our ſovereign, the welfare of the nation, and the preſervation of liberty, peace and happineſs to our ſelves and poſterity, influence and excite us to a different conduct.—May all prejudices ſubſide, may every fordid luſt and paſſion be forever baniſhed, and a manly, generous and public ſpirit prevail in every breaſt, and influence all to ſeek the public good.</p>
            <p>LET all be concerned to be poſſeſſed of <hi>true fortitude of mind,</hi> which, founded in and culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated upon the principles of virtue and religion, will render us good ſoldiers to our king, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful guardians to our country, and real benefactors to mankind.</p>
            <p>INSPIRED with this divine virtue, we ſhall be prepared for every ſervice, armed againſt every danger, and able to ſupport ourſelves under every ſhock and trial of life.—By this, we ſhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for the laſt encounter, enabled to ſupport the charge of the laſt enemy, and, even in this war from which there is no diſcharge,—in death itſelf, come off victorious, and riſe triumphant to a bleſſed immortality.</p>
