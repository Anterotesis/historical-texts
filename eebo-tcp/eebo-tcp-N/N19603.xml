            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>I CAN no longer withſtand the importunity of my Maria, but will haſten to improve every opportunity in gratifying your repeated ſolicitations.</p>
                  <p>You urge me, my dear, to return to the earlieſt period of my life, and to draw the picture from my firſt recollection of events. The juvenile parts of life, Maria, are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom marked with any great variety, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though your Caroline's has been uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly interſperſed with gloomy ſcenes.</p>
                  <p>Being left in infancy, an orphan, I was committed to the care of an aunt, for whom, when reaſon began to dawn upon my mind, I felt no great attachment. My uncle, who was a ſea Captain, was ſeldom at home; I had therefore but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle opportunity to experience his affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. My aunt, however, treated me with more attention, previous to her hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a child, than afterwards. I now began
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:025584_0005_0FCE03B9D4D84208"/>
to make ſome obſervations reſpecting her behaviour to me; but being naturally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, kept them to myſelf. I was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times indulged in viſiting an uncle and aunt, who, being without children, were deſirous I ſhould reſide with them; but the aunt with whom I was, would never conſent.</p>
                  <p>From the birth of my couſin, I found her ſeverity greatly increaſed towards me. My feelings were ſenſibly injured by her treatment, but I knew of no redreſs, and dreaded her reſentment. I was therefore the more aſſiduous in my endeavours to pleaſe, but to no effect. Upon a curſory acquaintance, ſhe was eſteemed as ſenſible and well bred; this was a thin veil, which a more intimate knowledge of her eaſily drew aſide. Shall I define her ſenſe, Maria? It did not conſiſt in a pure and elevated underſtanding, which leads to ſolid arguments and reaſonable concluſions: No, my dear; ſhe cheerfully relinquiſhed the dull road of ſyllogiſtic diſputation, to the peeviſh ſcholar and ſour recluſe, conceiving the ſtudy of the abſtruſe ſciences, as ſhe ſtiled logical reaſoning, qualifications re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:025584_0006_0FCE03BB1CF38F60"/>
only for the collegian and divine. With theſe ideas, her converſation was ever a ſcene of illiberal contradictions.</p>
                  <p>It is common, however, for weak minds to have an exalted opinion of their own abilities; thus it was with my aunt; and to the moſt conſummate ignorance was added an overbearing diſpoſition. Young as I was, my feelings were ſenſibly injured by her conduct to my uncle, for whom ſhe ever experienced a violent pang of love or hatred; at times hanging around his neck and pouring forth a profuſion of fond expreſſions, then relapſing into abuſe and ill treatment; extremely irritable and uncertain in her feelings and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. My ſituation was peculiarly diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, and the example ſet before me prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to my happineſs; but in this ſtate I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained until I was ten years old, when we received the melancholy news of my uncle's being drowned at ſea. This painful intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence affected my aunt, as trouble invari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably will perſons of her ungovernable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and ſhe was thrown into a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary ſtate of diſtraction. But the idea of being left ſole executrix to a handſome
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:025584_0007_0FCE03BC9ADA1988"/>
fortune, ſoon mitigated her diſtreſs and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbed the pearly tear from the cheek of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal woe. Money, Maria, poſſeſſes a balmy power; it can even heal the wounds of the heart. My uncle and aunt Franklin thinking this a good opportunity to gain the conſent of my aunt Noble, ſolicited the indulgence of having me with them; but my ſervices were too neceſſary for her to comply with their requeſt. Shortly after my uncle Noble's death, his brother loſt his wife.</p>
                  <p>Colonel Noble was a very different man from his brother: Ambitious beyond what his ſituation in life could poſſibly lead him to expect; vain of his imagined perſonal beauty, and extremely ignorant. My aunt, as ſoon as decency would permit, began to diſplay her charms, and made every advance which art could ſuggeſt to gain his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Her conduct expoſed her to the ridicule of her acquaintance; for the firſt advances to come from our ſex is, you know, my dear, derogatory to the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of the female mind. Suffice it to ſay, by an unwearied aſſiduity and great gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity to him and his family (for Colonel
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:025584_0008_0FCE03BFCF2BE558"/>
Noble's circumſtances were at this period embarraſſed) ſhe ſucceeded in her favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite wiſh of becoming his wife; or, as ſhe in her refined ſenſibility termed it, "re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed her firſt marriage." As all the bale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful qualities of ignorance were aſſimilated in this connection, the honey moon was ſhort. The Colonel, by his firſt wife, had three children, who ſoon became the cauſe of contention. My aunt, by her entire ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of mankind, and a want of one of the principal cardinal virtues, <hi>prudence,</hi> fooliſhly threw the fortune of her child, for whom ſhe was guardian, into the hands of her new huſband, whoſe embarraſſed cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances induced him to apply the prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty to family uſe; nor would his haughty diſpoſition permit him to render any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the monies received. This created daily diſputes. A prudent woman would have guarded againſt thoſe difficulties by appointing a new guardian, previous to her ſecond marriage. His conduct enraged my aunt, and her ſeverity to his children increaſed. Their contentions rendered me very unhappy, and finally threw me into a languid ſtate. While thus indiſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:025584_0009_0FCE03C127894AC8"/>
I repeatedly ſolicited to ſee my uncle F. who was a phyſician. He was at length ſent for; when he came, he was ſurpriſed at finding me ſo unwell, and obſerving my health required very great attention, inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon my being removed to his houſe, that he might have me under his immediate care. Thus was I relieved from that ſcene of wretchedneſs in which the family of my aunt was continually involved. The fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in which I was now placed were happy in themſelves, and aſſiduous to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate happineſs to your Caroline. An eaſy mind, united with their inexpreſſible kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſoon reſtored me to health. Hitherto my education had been cruelly neglected; this led them to pay a particular attention to my improvement, and they ſhortly implanted in my breaſt a deſire of knowledge. Maſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were liberally provided, and I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in all the branches of polite educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Reſpect to my aunt Noble required I ſhould ſometimes viſit her unhappy fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but as theſe viſits were only to comply with a neceſſary attention, I went but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. My deſire of improvement daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed; and my cloſe attention to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:025584_0010_0FCE03C29A89B380"/>
branches of my education, gained the affection of my uncle and aunt Franklin, who were equally ſolicitous to evince their attachment to their little orphan. But, Maria, death, envious of my felicity, in an unexpected moment, deprived me of my beloved aunt. This circumſtance ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed my uncle that he neglected his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; nor could my cloſeſt attention re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore him to his former tranquillity. I had the misfortune to ſee him languiſh two years, when he fell a ſacrifice to that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere affection, which had ever deſignated him an indulgent huſband.</p>
                  <p>Thus was a connection, fraught with fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity to themſelves and friends, cut off in the zenith of domeſtic enjoyment: Nor could the eligible ſituation, in which this diſtreſſing event placed me, ſooth my afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it preyed upon my mind and injur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my health. Being left joint heir with my couſin, then ſtationed at Fort Pitt, I felt the neceſſity of giving him the painful information of his uncle's death, and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome ſteps for my future ſituation in life. The property left me was in the funds; the intereſt of which, while I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:025584_0011_0FCE03C58E6F7AF8"/>
ſingle, was for my ſupport; but upon my being married, both principal and intereſt were to be at my, diſpoſal. The furniture was to be ſold at auction. This made it neceſſary I ſhould reſolve on ſome place where to remove. Thus, my dear, have I run through the juvenile parts of my life, which you will ſee have not been free from real ſorrow to your friend,</p>

                  <p>BY the death of my uncle and aunt, I was left, my dear Maria, at an age the moſt neceſſary to be protected, expoſed to the attack of every ſeducer. This reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the more readily induced me to return to the houſe of Colonel Noble, thinking that as I now had it in my power to pay for my board, I ſhould be leſs ſubject to their diſputes. I accordingly told my aunt, that as I wiſhed not to be interrupted by her family, if ſhe would accommodate me with a chamber to myſelf, I would board with her for a few months. To this ſhe cheerfully agreed; and I, from preſent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, returned to the place I moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted in my heart.</p>
                  <p>My uncle Franklin, at his death, had left me the liberty of ſelecting from a valuable collection of books, thoſe which ſuited my taſte; from the peruſal of theſe I anticipat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuperior gratification. In this I was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed. My aunt, poſſeſſed of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:025584_0013_0FCE03C7D9ED0A08"/>
and repining diſpoſition, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually intruded upon my retired mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, embittering them with a conſtant repetition of her wretchedneſs; and I ſoon repented of my folly in returning to her houſe.</p>
                  <p>Their quarrels ran high, and ſeveral days would frequently elapſe without their ſpeaking to each other: Nor did ſhe ever attempt to ſooth the paſſions of the Colonel; but irritated him in the moſt abuſive and imprudent manner. Thus thoſe breaches, which might have been healed by a ſoft and condeſcending diſpoſition, were increaſed until they became incurable wounds.</p>
                  <p>Her reſentment was not confined to the Colonel, but extended its ſeverity to his children. For her own child, all the feelings of a parental boſom vegetated in luxuriance: If in the leaſt indiſpoſed, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry luxury which the city afforded was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for her. Happy had it been, were ſhe diſpoſed to treat his former children with an equal degree of tenderneſs; ſhe might then have derived greater pleaſure from her connection.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="unknown:025584_0014_0FCE03CA35034DE8"/>In my abſence ſhe had made an addition to her family. The woman, Maria, who cannot reſolve fully to do the duty of a parent, certainly ſhould not undertake the charge of children, who muſt neceſſarily look to her for inſtruction and advice. It is requiſite that ſhe conceals even the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of a preference; for a partiality, once diſcovered, leſſens the confidence and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of her huſband, renders her diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected by the children, and depreciates her in the eyes of her domeſtics.</p>
                  <p>Another ſource of contention was her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme attachment to cards; ſhe however perſiſted in the indulgence of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity. In playing for amuſement only, there can be no real injury; but when the happineſs of our lives is ſuſpended upon it, what inference can be drawn from our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct which is not derogatory to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of rational beings? This exceſſive fondneſs for play, was very diſagreeable to the Colonel. A prudent woman would cheerfully have relinquiſhed ſo trifling a gratification for the ſecurity of her domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic happineſs, but his inclination ſhe ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom conſulted: And ſo infatuated was this
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:025584_0015_0FCE03CBA05E7408"/>
unhappy woman, that notwithſtanding his averſion, ſhe early <hi>inſtructed</hi> her children in the various games; and the youngeſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſix years old, was a conſiderable profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient at cards. As ſoon as the tea things were removed, loo, her favourite game, was introduced.</p>
                  <p>"From the inhuman treatment of her huſband, her health (ſhe ſaid) was greatly injured; amuſement was neceſſary for her." This mode of paſſing time was however totally repugnant to my wiſhes, yet I muſt acquieſce, or be thought to derogate from that politeneſs and attention, neceſſary to be obſerved to an aunt.</p>
                  <p>Unfortunate at play, the company were frequently thrown into confuſion by her reſentment; for ſhe ſeldom aroſe from the table without conſiderable loſs. This was an aggravation to my uncle, who, having no lucrative employment, made it neceſſary he ſhould curtail his expenſes; though an ill-judged ambition and pride, the natural growth of ignorance, led him to ſupport an external appearance, at the expenſe of many neceſſaries, for which his family ſuffered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="unknown:025584_0016_0FCE03CD1C6D9A68"/>My aunt had a ſmall income of ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pounds per annum, ſettled upon her by a relation, to continue during her life, and then to devolve to her firſt child. This but partially ſupplied her with pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et-money, for being what the world ſtyles generous; but what your Caroline denom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inates prodigal; it was inſufficient to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port her in thoſe extravagances to which ſhe had been, for a long time, habituated; and not feeling a diſpoſition to confine her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf within the limits of her income, while ſhe had the property of her deceaſed huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band in poſſeſſion, ſhe had moſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted it. The whole of the diſſipated property was charged to the extravagance of the Colonel: This excited frequent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, and at length induced her to purſue meaſures which produced ſerious conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.</p>
                  <p>Going privately to the judge, ſhe repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented her ſituation, gave up her guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ianſhip, urging the neceſſity of a new guardian, being appointed, who ſhould do immediate juſtice to her child. Agreeably to her wiſhes, the Colonel was ſummoned to appear, and obliged to render a ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:025584_0017_0FCE03D0013A3968"/>
of the accounts, which proved him to be conſiderably deficient. But, as it was ever ſuppoſed, my aunt had ſquander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a very great part.</p>
                  <p>The reduced ſituation of my uncle, put it out of his power to refund what had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably been applied to family uſe; and, diſguſted with the conduct of his wife, their houſe became a continued ſcene of jarrings, reflections, and diſputes. It was certainly proper that the child's property ſhould be ſecured even at the hazard of a ſeparation from her huſband; but theſe difficulties ſhe ought to have foreſeen.</p>
                  <p>The Colonel being deprived of the prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty of his ward, his next reſource, for the ſupport of his family, was from time to time, to diſpoſe of ſome valuable piece of furniture. This added to my aunt's uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—her complaints were inceſſant. She conſidered the whole city as her friends, and without reſerve proclaimed abroad her do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic troubles. The moſt entire ſtranger, as well as the particular friend, were alike entruſted with her family circumſtances. Her huſband ſhe repreſented as a villain and a cheat; and by this unpardonable conduct,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:025584_0018_0FCDE9DB16C0EF98"/>
ſo injured his character with his fellow cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izens, as to occaſion a total loſs of credit.</p>
                  <p>Thus unhappily was I ſituated for ſeveral months, when I reſolved to quit the city, and ſeek, in the boſom of a more retired life, that peace of which I was now depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>I had written to my couſin at Fort Pitt, and ſo far adjuſted my own affairs, as to be able to diſpoſe of myſelf in the method moſt agreeable to my wiſhes. I therefore took an early opportunity to acquaint my aunt with my intention, urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it as neceſſary to my health, that I ſhould paſs the approaching ſeaſon in the country. In a few weeks, an eligible ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation offering, I quitted, with avidity, this dwelling of murmur and complaint, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete with the moſt ſanguine ideas of future happineſs.</p>
                  <p>Scarce had I ſipped from this ſcene of promiſed pleaſure, one pleaſing draught, before I was interrupted with her peace-deſtroying letters, filled with her determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of leaving her barbarous huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; and, expreſſive of her inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be accommodated with her niece.
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:025584_0019_0FCE03D0DD8966C0"/>
Theſe letters, Maria, I never noticed, and in a few weeks became ſo inured to her complaints, that I began to feel leſs affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them.</p>
                  <p>The human mind, my dear, in length of time, can become habituated to any ſcene with which it is ſurrounded. Thus the moſt humane diſpoſition, by being conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant with ſufferings which at firſt made na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture recoil, often delights in thoſe very things that, but a ſhort time before, were ſo diſtreſſing to it. This obſervation demonſtrates the neceſſity of keeping the young mind remote from every ſpecies of cruelty.</p>
                  <p>Perplexed, as I had been, with the imprudencies of my aunt, I reaſoned with myſelf upon the impropriety of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting her complaints to deſtroy my promiſed happineſs. Becauſe ſhe was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to be wretched, why ſhould it cloud the dawn of my pleaſure? I ſincerely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gretted her ſituation; but reſolved that a mind which reveled in affliction, ſhould not render me unjuſt to myſelf. It is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, Maria, to conquer our feelings; but
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:025584_0020_0FCE03D26170F190"/>
by the aid of reaſon and philoſophy, we may learn to ſuppreſs an undue anxiety.</p>
                  <p>Viewing the unhappy ſituation of my aunt through its juſt medium, I ſhortly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to conſider her ſufferings as brought upon herſelf, by moſt imprudent conduct, and therefore reſolved to check my feelings. Believing, that although the Deity has im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted the delicate ſenſations of ſympathy deeply within our breaſts, it is by no means his intention we ſhould become miſerable, when it is not in our power to remove the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of the wretched object. No, my dear, it is wiſely ordered, as all human beings have their own misfortunes to ſupport, they ſhall not be capable of retaining the ſame acute ſenſations for the diſtreſſed, as they experienced at firſt ſight, and previous to their having offered ſuch relief as their abil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities would admit.</p>
                  <p>The pleaſing thought of having render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a temporary ſuſpenſion of miſery to a fellow mortal, is fragrant to the tender mind: Having done this, we return to our own particular concerns. Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and misfortunes await us in the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of life. No ſituation, however eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:025584_0021_0FCE03D58A9876A0"/>
can ſecure us from anxiety and pain. Says Doctor Young—</p>
                  <l>"The gay, rich, great, triumphant, and auguſt,</l>
                  <l>What are they? The moſt happy (ſtrange to ſay!)</l>
                  <l>Convince me moſt of human miſery."</l>
                  <p>Theſe reflections it was my ſtudy to ſtrengthen: The indulgence rendered me tranquil.</p>
                  <p>The village to which I had retired was upon the road to New-York; in it were ſeveral genteel families, ſo that I was at no loſs for ſociety, when diſpoſed to amuſe myſelf abroad. In the friendly circle, Maria, where converſation is enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the obſervations of our ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours in wiſdom and experience, much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction may be derived: It unbends the mind, gives it a new reliſh for retirement, ſoftens the manners and harmonizes the thoughts.</p>
                  <p>The young ladies who belong to Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, a great part of their time, reſided in Philadelphia or New-York, for the benefit of their education, which deprived me of the opportunity of cultivating a friendſhip with thoſe of my own age. This circumſtance at firſt was an alloy to my
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:025584_0022_0FCE03D6DBCC1E90"/>
ſatisfaction; for we naturally ſeek our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates from among thoſe of our particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſtanding in life. Here we expect to find correſpondent inclinations, and from an agreement in diſpoſitions, a friendſhip is gradually cemented, which ſtrengthens with advancing years; and, in the decline of life, is frequently productive of much real enjoyment.</p>
                  <p>Attached, however, to retirement, and never at a loſs for amuſement when I could obtain an entertaining book, I baniſhed this diſpapointment.</p>
                  <p>The college being near, introduced many young gentlemen to my acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. I was ſeldom without a gallant, and had not been long in Princeton before I enliſted ſeveral of the ſtudents to the ſtandard of love; or, perhaps, to ſpeak with more propriety, they were charmed with my fortune, which was now greatly increaſed by the unfortunate circumſtance of my couſin's ſuppoſed death; my uncle in this caſe having left me ſole heir.</p>
                  <p>The painful intelligence of Major Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly's defeat, while it threw a general gloom upon the citizens at large, doubly affected the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:025584_0023_0FCE03D85C725170"/>
promiſed happineſs of your Caroline, as it deprived me of the protection and advice of a much eſteemed friend. My couſin being left in a ſituation ſimilar to Major Willys, it was doubtful whether he was really dead, or had fallen into the hands of the Savages. Until ſome information could be obtained, we believed he had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len a ſacrifice. No reflections, my dear Maria, could mitigate this ſevere affliction. The idea that he might poſſibly be a priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner with the Indians, diſturbed my pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures, and cruelly tortured my every enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Followed with the cloſeſt attention from the ſtudents, many ſuſpicions were excited in my breaſt, that my fortune was the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net which ſo powerfully attracted their notice.</p>
                  <p>The influence of riches is great. Young and old pay adoration at the ſhrine of wealth, but your Caroline has had ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient warning to guard her heart.—Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, Maria, is a ſerious engagement.</p>

                  <p>TEASED, perplexed, ſolicited by a group of fortune hunters, I can have no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments my own. Poor Caroline, how does your money involve you in new difficulties! but I am fixed: To matrimony I will not be confined. A huſband, what a name! is not my aunt a leſſon? I will leave the dull road of married life to fools. Thus thought your friend; but, Maria, thoughts change.</p>
                  <p>Walking was a recreation in which I uſually indulged twice a day when the weather would permit. I had for ſome time accuſtomed myſelf to ſtroll into a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful ſpot, to which accident at firſt led me. Here I was entertained by the little ſongſters who charmed me with their mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ody, and ſhed a ſuperior pleaſure upon my ſoul. This I believed calculated for the habitation of ſome ſylvan deity. In it I generally paſſed ſeveral hours before break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, peruſing ſome favourite author. While
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:025584_0025_0FCE03DCE3154AF0"/>
I remained in this retirement, I forgot the diſappointments which had veiled my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agined felicity; I became loſt in inexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble happineſs. The boughs of the friendly trees by nature formed a ſhade around me; theſe were decorated with a variety of ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous vines, which entwined themſelves in various directions, and while they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted the eye, waſted fragrance to the ſmell. Upon the ſtumps of a couple of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed trees I had placed a board which ſerved me as a ſeat; every thing around encouraged contemplation.</p>
                  <p>One morning as I entered the bowry, I was greatly ſurpriſed to ſee a miniature picture lying upon the bench; for I had flattered myſelf this delightful place was free from intruders. The picture I ſeized with eagerneſs, viewed it and was enrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured: Oh! exclaimed I, is this the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait of a human being? Sincerely do I wiſh his heart!—Fear now diſturbed my reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. I was uneaſy leaſt I ſhould meet the owner in this place of ſolitude, and aroſe to retire, but caſting my eyes around, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the ſame peace and ſerenity yet reigned in every ſhrub, I ventured to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay

my return, and ſitting down upon the bench wrote with my pencil the following: "<hi>The picture left in this place is in ſafe and friendly hands.</hi>" A few days after I found a billet under a ſtone upon the bench, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to Caroline, of which the encloſed is a copy.</p>

                  <p>Thunderſtruck at the demand, I ſat heſitating what to do, when I ſuddenly heard a ruſtling among the buſhes, and looking towards the noiſe, diſcovered a young gentleman coming up to me. I was much alarmed. He obſerved my aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſtepping gracefully to me, ſeized my hand: "My charming girl," ſaid he, "your fears are groundleſs, give me leave to ſeat you. The incident that has cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to obtrude upon your retirement, which I have long obſerved pleaſing to you, when you thought yourſelf ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:025584_0027_0FCE03E13479B358"/>
from all obſervation, has been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate to me: Yes, Caroline, I am neither ignorant of your name, charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or ſituation. The lines you wrote upon this bench were read by a young lady to whom I have long been engaged; for the loſs of the picture ſhe is indeed inconſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; I muſt therefore requeſt you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore it to me." I pauſed. "You flatter me," ſaid he, "by the reluctance with which you relinquiſh it." It was, indeed, Maria, a requeſt hard to reconcile with the feelings of my heart. The charming youth continued, "with rapture would I improve the preſent opportunity, to offer a heart devoted to you alone; but friends and parental wiſhes have long ſince deprived me of the choice:" Then falling on his knees, he drew out of his pocket a locket elegantly ſet in gold. It repreſented in hair-work, Hope, leaning upon her uſual emblem, the anchor, and pointing with her other hand to a fountain, out of which two doves were drinking; on the back of it was inſcribed "<hi>To friendſhip.</hi>" "This is my own performance," ſaid he, "will you honour me by your acceptance of it?" It
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:025584_0028_0FCE03E261EA4FE0"/>
was inſufficient to purchaſe the picture then in poſſeſſion; but how could I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe his requeſt. I made no reply: He was ſtill kneeling, urging my acceptance. While in this attitude, who ſhould appear, through a diſtant row of trees, but the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viable, the happy Eliza! I was too well informed of her diſpoſition, not to tremble at her approach.</p>
                  <p>Upon my firſt arrival at Princeton, I had been particularly cautioned not to form any connexion with this young lady, being the only child of parents who had ruined her in her education; and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a naturally revengeful and jealous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, ſhe had made herſelf diſagreeable to all her acquaintance. Clarimont was ſurpriſed; he aroſe in much confuſion, and walking towards her, ſeized her hand, ſaying, "I was pleading for the return of the picture upon which you are pleaſed to ſet ſo high a value." Until this moment I was ignorant whoſe property I had in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, and dreading her revengeful tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, haſtened to her, preſenting the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I wiſh not to detain this, ſaid I, but am happy in reſtoring the valuable
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:025584_0029_0FCE03E3B410CFC8"/>
treaſure. Her countenance was ſuffuſed with reſentment: ſhe appeared to diſpute the ſincerity of my expreſſions. I imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately retired, reſolving never to reviſit a place which had been once ſo pleaſing to me, leaſt it ſhould appear with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to meet Clarimont, and become fatal to either of us by the dreaded diſpoſition of Eliza. Having no wiſh to interrupt the romantic lovers, I reſolved to ſeek ſome new ſpot which ſhould, if poſſible, compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate the loſs of that to which I had been ſo partial.</p>
                  <p>Riſing very early one morning I croſſed ſome adjacent fields, and paſſing towards a wood which promiſed to ſupply my wiſhes, ſcarce had I entered among the trees, when I was alarmed by a voice which appeared to be in very great diſtreſs. I ſtopped— nor can language expreſs my aſtoniſhment. Remote from every object, my only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource was to return to the road. With trembling ſteps I gained a ſecret path; but had not proceeded far, before the report of of a piſtol gave freſh agitation to my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed mind. Almoſt diſtracted with fright, I had ſcarce ſtrength to gain the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:025584_0030_0FCE03E6E2229DF0"/>
road, when I ſeated myſelf, to recover, if poſſible, my aſtoniſhed ſenſes. I had been here but a few minutes, before an amazing duſt aroſe in columns at a little diſtance. This was occaſioned by a detachment of new levies marching to the Weſtern Country. As they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, every fearful idea of a female mind ruſhing into view, your Caroline fainted. When I came to myſelf, I found I was in the arms of an officer, who by ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery tender and polite attention, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to calm my mind. He urged to know what had thus affected me. I was unable to reply, and could expreſs no more than <hi>the piſtol—the woods</hi>—pointing in conſtern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to the ſpot. A party was inſtantly detached to ſearch for the cauſe of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, who ſoon, returned with the account of having found a young man weltering in his blood, lifeleſs upon the ground. By this time I had ſo far recovered as to be able to walk; and ſupporting myſelf upon the arm of the officer, ſoon reached my lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
                  <p>This event cauſed a general alarm thro'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the village, and in a few hours the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:025584_0031_0FCE03E81D11B620"/>
painful intelligence reached me, that Clarimont, the lover of Eliza, had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len by his own hands. The agitation of my mind prevented that attention to my benefactor which his politeneſs mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited. I did not permit him to leave me without a promiſe of calling upon me, ſhould an opportunity preſent.</p>
                  <p>At this period, little did I expect, this incident would deſtroy my future happineſs. Providence has wiſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed thoſe events which are deſtined to overtake us in the walks of life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I had not been in company with the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate youth, ſince the morning we met in the arbour, having been particularly cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious not to fall in his way. To what induc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to take this ſtep I was a ſtranger.</p>
                  <p>A jury was ſummoned, who having ſat upon the body, brought in their verdict <hi>inſane.</hi> The connexions of Eliza now took charge of the corpſe. They prepared to perform the laſt office to the deceaſed; as Clarimont belonged to Virginia, and had been ſent to this village for his educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A few days after his interment, I received the following billet from Eliza:

                  <p>This affair having put a period to my enjoyments in this place, I was urged by my friends to abſent myſelf for ſome time from the immediate eye of Eliza, who had become ſtrongly prejudiced againſt me, and frequently expreſſed her implacable reſentment.</p>
                  <p>Uneaſy at continuing in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Eliza, while ſhe remained thus bitter againſt me, and having been repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly ſolicited to viſit New-York, I took a ſeat in the ſtage to that city. Upon my arrival I was received with every mark of friendſhip by Lucretia Barton, a young lady for whom I had early imbibed a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular eſteem. She was the only child of Mr. Thomas Barton, a reſpectable merch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:025584_0034_0FCE03EE1D96B118"/>
in New-York; and having been deprived of her mother in infancy, had paſſed much of her time at a boarding ſchool in Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, where our friendſhip commenced. By the ſprightly ſociety of this dear girl, the gloom which involved my mind, grad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually diſſipated.</p>
                  <p>From the obſervations I had made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the unhappy conduct of my aunt, I had long eſtabliſhed it a maxim of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and a dictate of reaſon, to make as eaſy as poſſible the various incidents which occur in the journey of life. To Clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, I confeſs, I was partial: In his happineſs was my heart intereſted; but the ſuſpicions which were excited in the breaſt of Eliza were as oppoſed to my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence as they were deſtructive of my peace.</p>
                  <p>The parties in which I was frequently engaged tended to eraſe from recollection the dull ſcenes of Princeton. A ſucceſſion of pleaſureable events often abſorbs the mind, and we forget, when ſurrounded with diſſipation and amuſement, the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful circumſtances which had previouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:025584_0035_0FCE03EF9C822050"/>
our happineſs: Thus is human ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence rendered more tolerable.</p>
                  <p>During my viſit in this city I received ſeveral letters from my repining aunt: Theſe afforded Lucretia and myſelf much amuſement. They informed me ſhe had left her inhuman huſband, and taken a ſmall houſe at Trenton, where ſhe anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the pleaſure of ſeeing me and my friend. Lucretia, pleaſed with the invitation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to accompany me. We according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engaged a ſeat in the ſtage, and were ſafely landed at the door of my aunt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, who, ever attached to company, gave us a warm reception. Civility and cuſtom obliged us to enquire after her health. One enquiry, Maria, was a ſufficient opening for the relation of all her mental and bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily ſufferings. She ſeized the hand of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretia and began the unintereſting recital. When ſhe came to the deſcription of her diſorders, it was indeed difficult to refrain from ſmiling. "A numbneſs of the brain, an extreme preſſure upon the eyes, and a conſtant irritation of the nervous ſyſtem, I apprehend inſanity muſt finally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue." Converſing upon this ſubject brought
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:025584_0036_0FCE03F200872D78"/>
on all her <hi>ſpaſms, contractions,</hi> &amp;c. The doctor was called; he entered the room: his ſaddle bags containing his ſpecific med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icine, variouſly modified, hung upon his arm. This valuable compoſition, Maria, in the opinion of this ſon of Eſculapius, was a <hi>ſummum bonum</hi>; it poſſeſſed all the virtues of the <hi>materia medica.</hi> Said Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretia, aſide, will it cure a weak head? We handed him a chair; he ſeated himſelf by my aunt, and with great tenderneſs, ſolicited her to be compoſed. "I am afraid of convulſions, doctor." "Don't be alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, madam," he replied; "it is the extreme tenſion upon ſome of the fine veſſels which produces this diſtreſſing taught<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; you want ſome invigorating applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nothing is a greater ſtimulus than camphire; a few drops of this valuable drug, will ſhortly relieve you; the virtues of this incomparable gum, madam, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the city doctors. It may be uſed to inexpreſſible advantage in every diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to which we are incident. In fevers its efficacy cannot be denied by its peculiar diaphoretic quality; it rapidly throws off obſtructions; it ſurpriſingly heals the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:025584_0037_0FCE03F383B93770"/>
of the bowels and ſtomach in conſumptive habits, and brings on the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary expectoration for the relief of the lungs; it forcibly expels all internal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments, acting upon the nerves as opium upon the ſenſes; lulls their agitation, and renders the patient tranquil and compoſed. Nor is it leſs beneficial in all external ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications; even mortifications may be ſtopt by its peculiar power." During his animadverſions upon the efficacy of cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire, he ſeveral times repeated the doſe, which was adminiſtered in a cordial. My aunt began to be in better ſpirits. The doctor, after having often reminded us of the ignorance of the city phyſicians, withdrew.</p>
                  <p>This was a diverting ſcene. I fear, Maria, as you are unacquainted with this aunt of mine, you will begin to think me deſtitute of thoſe tender ſenſations which beautify humanity. If theſe are your ideas you derogate from your friend, whoſe ſoul is alive to ſympathy, and in whoſe eye frequently ſparkles the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genial tear. My aunt is not without my pity; but the troubles ſhe experiences are brought upon her by a weak mind, which
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:025584_0038_0FCE03F4DBD778D0"/>
ſhe never has taken pains to correct, and an entire ignorance of human nature. Theſe ſources alone would be ſufficient to involve her in continual difficulties, had not an ungovernable temper ſealed her miſery. Philoſophers ſay, all the virtues are in conjunction; is this the caſe, my aunt Noble is ſtrikingly deficient; ſince prudence, which is firſt upon the liſt, nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er had the moſt remote connexion with any part of her conduct. The moral vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues only execute what prudence preſcribes.</p>
                  <p>Had ſhe taken the ſteps previous to her late marriage which ſhe has ſince been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to adopt, thoſe great cauſes of her unhappineſs had been impeded. Nor could this precaution in any degree evince a want of confidence in Mr. Noble; ſhe would then have experienced a ſatisfaction in her own reflections which would have rendered her inexpreſſibly happy.</p>
                  <p>Nothing is more luxuriant to a thinking mind than ſelf approbation: It is a ſun which diſpels the clouds of ſolicitude and anxiety. Homer tells us of an herb which the ancients called <hi>Nepenthe</hi>; that being made an ingredient in their feaſts, baniſhed
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:025584_0039_0FCE03F763088950"/>
ſorrow from their minds. I wiſh we could obtain this valuable plant for my aunt: It would be a pleaſing ſubſtitute for cards; for, as uſual, the tea tray is no ſooner removed, than the apparatus for play is introduced.</p>
                  <p>We had been here but a few days, when Lucretia began to complain that nervous company diſagreed with her taſte. Few hours could be agreeable under my aunt's roof. She ever corroded the pleaſures of the table with a recital of her ill treatment and indiſpoſition: Her uncommon dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties were the theme of converſation; her family troubles the topic at all times and places. If checked for indulging a gloomy diſpoſition, ſhe declared her diſtreſs involuntary and unavoidable. Every pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing idea forſook her. Her hours were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to tears, and the moſt bitter invectives againſt her cruel huſband.</p>
                  <p>I believe you regret that my aunt is thus connected in the ſtory of your unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate friend,</p>

                  <p>IN addition to the failings I have already deſcribed, my aunt Noble poſſeſſed the painful faculty of anticipating diſtreſſing events; ſo that we were not only entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with her perſonal difficulties, but amuſed with ſome dreadful misfortune which was continually about to befal her darling children. The gloomy premoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of her mind deprived us of all enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. We certainly have no occaſion to ſeek the evils of life, they will ever obtrude themſelves upon us. To add to her afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhe was continually tormented with dreams which foreboded ſome ſad event, yet ſhe never acknowledged to have ſlept. Why madam, ſaid I, will you not wait until the trouble comes, it is ſurely ſufficient to feel it when it has overtaken you; by indulging this diſpoſition, you ſuffer in imagination what may never become real, and thus accumulate diſtreſs. It is the duty of rational beings to exert the powers
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:025584_0041_0FCE03FA201C3AE8"/>
of the mind, and to render themſelves as comfortable and happy as the mutability of human life will admit. But my aunt was as great a ſtranger to ethics as to the cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal virtues. Tired with a continued repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of grievances and complaints, I dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her company. Theſe, however, would have affected me but little, had ſhe not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded upon me, when I retired to my chamber, and thus diſturbed my moments of reflection.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Addiſon juſtly obſerves, "That we ſhould not trouble our friends with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which muſt oblige them to real or feigned affliction. Cares, diſtreſſes, diſeaſes, uneaſineſſes, and diſlikes of our own, are by no means to be obtruded upon them. We ſhould not bring them little ſorrows, which do not belong to them. Fortune gives us diſappointments ſufficient; nature is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with infirmities enough, without our adding to the unhappy ſide of our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count by ſpleen or ill humour."</p>
                  <p>The phyſician of my aunt was invaria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly called, three or four times a week, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new his preſcriptions of camphire, which he adminiſtered in various ways; ſometimes
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:025584_0042_0FCE03FD4590A308"/>
in powder to "brace the debility of her delicate frame;" at others in drops, "to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe itſelf into the little veſſels and cauſe a proper animation of the parts. The head, madam, abounds with an infinite number of fine veſſels, ſome of which are too crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with blood, while others are flabby and want to be wound up: Taking plentifully of theſe, and keeping yourſelf compoſed, will ſoon relieve you. Camphire is exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively diffuſive, invigorating and pungent."</p>
                  <p>There were no circumſtances which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred while we were at this village, more replete with diverſion to Lucretia and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf than the doctor's viſits. In the city they are ſhort; but a country phyſician brings in his ſaddle-bags, takes off his great-coat and hat, and is ſeated for an hour or two: It is a fortunate circumſtance their demands are not in proportion to the length of their viſits. I do not pretend to ſay all my aunt's diſorders were imaginary, but am confident an attention to exerciſe and diet, would make her life much more comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. I can ſcarcely believe the complaints of thoſe, who pay no attention to the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of their lives; but at the expenſe of
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:025584_0043_0FCE03FE9A58B488"/>
health, that greateſt bleſſing mortals can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, gratify their moſt vitiated appetites; it is unreaſonable to expect that a delicate and infirm habit ſhould not ſeverely ſuffer from ſuch indulgences; theſe imprudences muſt render futile the attentions of the phyſician, and defeat the applications of the moſt learned practitioner.</p>
                  <p>Lucretia wiſhes to viſit Philadelphia: She is uneaſy leſt ſhe ſhould become con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taminated, and frequently obſerves, there is no advantage to be derived from paſſing our time with thoſe gloomy minds which revel in affliction, and whoſe moſt luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous repaſt appears to be the bitter of life.</p>
                  <p>Did not the circle of our own acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance preſent to knowledge ſimilar characters with that of my aunt Noble, it would be difficult to realize their exiſtence. That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings endowed with the powers of rational reflection, who are at liberty to dwell upon any ſubject, ſhould ſelect from that variety which might employ their thoughts, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſing premonitions, and indulge the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of troubles which may never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt, evinces an unpardonable vacancy of mind which muſt ſtigmatize their folly, and
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:025584_0044_0FCE04001DEF19E8"/>
render them contemptible and little in the opinion of thoſe who are ſo unfortunate as to have any intercourſe with them. It cannot therefore ſurpriſe you that Lucre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia is deſirous to leave this place. For my own part, I am ſick of hearing a worn out ſtory related to every new face which appears. Diſguſted with her company, I confine myſelf to my chamber; even here, as before obſerved, I am interrupted: It is impoſſible to indulge my own ideas. She is diſpleaſed that I thus ſeclude myſelf. "It is evident I ſlight her ſociety." She complains much to Lucretia. "Her niece, ſhe believes, will turn her brain with reading. For her part ſhe cannot imagine what buſineſs women have with books, unleſs it is now and then an entertaining novel. She never knew one who after all her ſtudy ever became a Locke or a Newton. There are certain do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic employments for females beyond which they have no right to deviate. Science belongs not to them: Let them ſtudy to grace a table, become converſant in domeſtic concerns, and their minds are ſufficiently improved. But Caroline, to be ſure, muſt be turning over the leaves of
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:025584_0045_0FCE04032ACA3170"/>
ſome old hiſtory. How ſhe can amuſe her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with ſuch dry narrations I cannot tell."</p>
                  <p>That ſuch remarks ſhould fall from a woman, who has no idea of the real enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is derived from ſo rational an indulgence, is by no means ſurpriſing. Could ſhe reliſh this mode of paſſing her leiſure moments, the vacuum ſhe now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences, would vaniſh; a country life would then be more conſonant with her feelings.</p>
                  <p>If, with the "mind's eye," ſhe had a taſte to travel through diſtant kingdoms and take a retroſpective view of paſt events, ſhe might nouriſh that fondneſs for variety, ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant with human nature, and in the indulgence of this diſpoſition be happy. Sincerely do I wiſh her ſingular in theſe degrading ſentiments; then ſhould we ſhine more conſpicuous.</p>
                  <p>The divine Creator has made no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the ſouls of the ſexes, but giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to each, ſimilar powers of improvement. Education alone conſtitutes the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority. It hath hitherto been our miſfortune to be greatly neglected, while ſchools and colleges have been inſtituted, and every poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:025584_0046_0FCE04049BA00968"/>
method adopted to direct the expand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing minds of the other ſex. Early are they inſtructed in ſuch ſtudies as will be moſt beneficial to them; and from infancy habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to arrange their ideas, their whole time is devoted to reflection. Can it be wondered that they who have made it the buſineſs of their lives, to become maſters of reaſoning, ſhould excel us who have been deprived of thoſe advantages. All the education thought neceſſary for our ſex until within a few years, has been ſimple reading and writing. Thus neglected we muſt poſſeſs aſtoniſhing geniuſes to riſe ſuperior to the impediments with which we have been ſurrounded; yet we ſometimes meet with thoſe who have ſtrength to ſoar above theſe difficulties and reflect a luſtre upon female abilities.</p>
                  <p>In the preſent ſyſtem of education, there appears to be a very great error. Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing young ladies upon the ſtage to ſpeak in public, tends to give them a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence which does not belong to a female; and ſo far from encouraging thoſe feelings nature has implanted, lulls them into a dangerous apathy, and by repetition, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys that eaſy, natural delicacy which ſhould ever adorn their characters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="48" facs="unknown:025584_0047_0FCE04061B4D6CF8"/>A certain degree of aſſurance is neceſſary for the gentlemen; but a lady is moſt pleaſingly deſignated by a modeſt reſerve. It is the moſt attractive charm ſhe can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs. True modeſty avoids the eye of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic admiration. Nature has connected in our compoſition ſuch a keenneſs of ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, that we are pained when expoſed to public obſervation.</p>
                  <p>A young lady, early accuſtomed to gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel company, will ever acquire ſufficient confidence for private life. It is neceſſary to inſtruct thoſe only who are deſigned for the theatre, to ſpeak before crouded audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>

                  <p>ATTACHED to riding on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, Lucretia and myſelf make frequent excurſions. In one of theſe rambles, in which by neceſſity we were unattended, for a country life ſeldom affords gallants, an incident took place which determined us in future to be more cautious. Yet ſuch is the conſtruction of the human mind, that fear muſt be ſtrongly impreſt not to wear off by time. Inſtead of riding in the morning as had been our uſual practice, we concluded to go in the afternoon, wiſhing to take a road, which in the morning, was rendered diſagreeable by giving us the ſun in our faces. The day was inviting, we were pleaſed with the proſpect around, and unmindful of our diſtance from home. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in converſation, the ſun had ſet before we had any idea of its retiring. An improving companion is an inſtructing thief, which inſenſibly ſteals away the hours. It was, however, prudent for us to haſten
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:025584_0049_0FCE0409E0162C20"/>
into the main road, where we naturally ſuppoſed ourſelves more ſecure. Juſt as we had entered the poſt road, we were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly addreſſed by a perſon on horſe-back, who appeared diſpoſed to accompany us. He begged to know how far we were going. We aſſured him we were but a ſhort diſtance from home and under no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions. Notwithſtanding this, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon accompanying us. We had gone but a little way before we made an addition to our party. A perſon who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared well acquainted with our gallant rode up, and addreſſed him in a ſtyle which alarmed us. Being upon the great road we flattered ourſelves we ſhould ſoon meet with ſome traveller who would relieve us. Lucretia and myſelf rode as near as poſſible to each other. Our boſoms beat with anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety. Our gallants ſoon ſeparated, and rode one upon each ſide of us. Thus confined between them, judge of our feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Juſt as we came to a retired path they propoſed our turning into it; and finding we would not conſent, they ſeized, at the ſame inſtant, the bridles of both our horſes, and with an oath declared we ſhould
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:025584_0050_0FCE040B5A93FC50"/>
do as they ſaid. I ſhudder when I recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the providential means of our eſcape. At this moment, encouraged by the ſound of horſes' feet we ſcreamed for help. The villains were alarmed, and letting go their hold, rode off with precipitation. We were immediately overtaken by a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man on his journey to New-York. He inquired the cauſe of our fears; very politely attended us to the door of my aunt, and would now have taken leave, but we urged him to alight; and underſtanding he intended putting up at the next inn, inſiſted on his taking a bed, which he accepted. Before he left us he impreſt the neceſſity of our being attended by ſome gentleman in our future excurſions, and promiſed to call upon us on his return from New-York, if we had left Trenton, to gratify us with a viſit in Philadelphia. This incident freſh in our minds made us cautious of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing abroad; it was ſeveral weeks before we dared to loſe ſight of the houſe.</p>
                  <p>The obligation we were under to Mr. Wilkins, the gentleman who fortunately relieved us from our apparent danger, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites a lively gratitude in the boſom of your friend,</p>

                  <p>A FEW days after I wrote you laſt, as Lucretia and myſelf were ſtrolling upon the banks of a little ſtream, which meander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the foot of a hill but a ſhort diſtance from the houſe of my aunt, we were alarmed by voices which appeared to be diſtant; the water only conveying the ſound. This, it is probable, would not have produced any uneaſy ſenſations in our minds, but for the incident before related. The danger we had lately eſcaped ruſhed full upon us; and without delay we turned towards the path, reſolved to reach the road as quick as poſſible. This we ſcarce had time to effect, when looking behind, we obſerved a perſon in the habit of a woman gaining faſt upon us. The oddity of her dreſs and the peculiarity of her appearance inſtantly made us ſuſpect it to be a man. Suſpicion gave wings to our feet and we ſoon fell in with ſome honeſt farmers, under whoſe eſcort we once more ſafely entered
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:025584_0052_0FCE040FDC6BF0A0"/>
our own doors. It was now judged pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent we ſhould immediately leave Trenton, as ſeveral circumſtances corroborated to convince us a plan was forming againſt me by Eliza. We accordingly took ſeats in the ſtage for Philadelphia.</p>
                  <p>It was with pleaſure we quitted Trenton, not becauſe the charms of a rural life had loſt their reliſh: No, Maria; ſecluded from the buſy ſcenes of the metropolis, we are free from many cares which extend a fever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh anxiety, while ſurrounded with diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which too often deſtroys reflection and embitters life. But it is painful to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to one diſtreſſing theme. Human life is ſufficiently crowded with perſonal troubles: To ſupport them with fortitude, ſhould be the endeavour of every rational mind.</p>
                  <p>Encompaſſed by innumerable cares and anxieties, it was never intended we ſhould take any further ſhare in the troubles of thoſe around, than was ſufficient, if in our power to relieve their diſtreſs. It certainly would be a great addition to the miſeries of life, ſhould we ſuffer ourſelves to be made wretched by every deſponding gloomy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:025584_0053_0FCE041177CD2BE8"/>
our pity is indeed excited, we la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their weakneſs, and urge the neceſſity of fortitude. Such is the natural imbecility of the human mind, it confines us to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſcenes in which we are engaged; and as new objects preſent, the paſt is in a degree eraſed from recollection. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is wiſely ordered.</p>
                  <p>In this city we have taken lodgings at a widow Leaſon's. She is polite and agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but as no one is without their particular characteriſtic, we cannot expect our land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady to be an exception. Mrs. Leaſon has one child, bleſſed with good natural abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and educated by a leſs indulgent parent, ſhe might have ſhone in a domeſtic charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but when the idea is inſtilled in the youthful mind, that it is to be indulged in all its wiſhes, let the diſpoſition be ever ſo pleaſing, the ſoil is contaminated, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of producing a grateful vegetation, is over-run with a ſpontaneous exuberance of pride, which choaks every fragrant ſprout.</p>
                  <p>Laura by this too indulgent mother, is even prevented from taking the neceſſary exerciſe which the conſtitution requires. It would be natural to ſuppoſe, from the line
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:025584_0054_0FCE0413F485E470"/>
of life which Providence has allotted Mrs. Leaſon, ſhe would have habituated her daughter to early attentions in the family. Nothing can better qualify a young lady, who expects one day to become the miſtreſs of a family, than a proper reſpect to the economy and regulations in domeſtic con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns. I believe it to be a duty parents owe their children, early to inſtruct them in ſuch ſcenes as will be neceſſary to future happineſs; and let my fortune be ever ſo independent, I am reſolved, ſhould I ever commence the mother, early to accuſtom my daughters daily to devote a few hours to domeſtic matters; this will never render them leſs reſpected abroad.</p>
                  <p>Do not miſtake me. I have no wiſh to confine female education to domeſtic du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. No, Maria; the greateſt ſource of our happineſs is an enlightened mind. It is a cauſe of regret that more attention is not paid to our education. If the mind is a barren waſte, of what avail are the beauties of the moſt lovely face, the elegance of the moſt enchanting ſhape, the grace of the moſt accompliſhed perſon; the impercepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hand of time will deprive them of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:025584_0055_0FCE04151C7BEA78"/>
external charm, and eclipſe the luſtre of the moſt penetrating eye. But the mind, that immortal part, can never fade. If properly cultivated, it will unfold new beauties, and by a continual progreſs in virtue and happineſs, be finally prepared for ſuperior enjoyments above; while a trifling diſſipated diſpoſition can never be attuned to thoſe delightful employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which engage ſo many departed ſaints in heaven.</p>
                  <p>Laura is fond of reading, and by having free acceſs to the city library, is in a ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to indulge ſo laudable an attachment; but like too many of her ſex, ſhe neglects thoſe writings which would be beneficial and inſtructive, and with avidity ſeizes every romantic volume; thus her taſte be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes poiſoned. I wiſh not too ſeverely to condemn this kind of writing, but only to impreſs the idea that the choice ſhould be directed by judgment. "The ſtyle in which they are frequently dreſſed capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates the mind, and conveys poiſon to the youthful fancy; although their influence is imperceptible, it is not the leſs ſure. The paſſions too often become inflamed, and
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:025584_0056_0FCE04169ABE2548"/>
by a repetition of love adventures, the pure ideas become injured, and we feel a ſecret wiſh to imitate ſcenes with which we are thus delighted. They have ruined the minds of many, by inſtilling into them principlies of duplicity and intrigue, and thus prepared them for ſimilar violations of morality and virtue."</p>
                  <p>I have repeatedly expreſſed my ſurpriſe at Laura's taſte. She in return is as much aſtoniſhed that any can be pleaſed with the dry, inſipid page of hiſtory. Are you fond of love adventures, I replied, you will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten meet with them in hiſtory. An illicit love occaſioned the deſtruction of the fineſt city in Aſia. It cauſed Anthony to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake Octavia, and revel in the arms of the celebrated Cleopatra.</p>
                  <p>By this delightful ſtudy you will be taught the fatal effects of jealouſy and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition. At one period you will ſee the world involved in the greateſt ignorance and barbariſm; at another, riſing by civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ization and refinement, decorated in all the charms of politeneſs and learning: But it is impoſſible to gain her attention.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="58" facs="unknown:025584_0057_0FCE04196714B708"/>Mrs. Leaſon's error, in her daughter's education, is greatly to be lamented. Hab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its contracted in early life are often unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable: Great care is therefore requiſite that none ſhould be formed but ſuch as will eſtabliſh virtuous and ſolid ſatisfaction: Then would our days dawn amidſt the ſmiles of an approving conſcience, and cloſe with ſuperlative pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>A ſtriking trait in the character of our landlady is a ſympathy of ſoul: She is ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ready to mitigate the ſufferings of the diſtreſſed; and the congenial tear, which is infinitely more valuable than the diadem of Caeſar, often trembles in her eye and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers the gentleneſs of her heart: This caſts a veil over many of her failings, while others are too unpardonable to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>Her ſtrong propenſity to diſcover the ſecrets of thoſe families in which ſhe viſits, certainly evinces a little mind: To this is added a great fondneſs for match-making. Several matches formed by her have prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unhappy: This is not ſurpriſing. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions, which reſult from motives of convenience or intereſt, either terminate in
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:025584_0058_0FCE041A78CE34B0"/>
wretchedneſs, or are embittered with many real evils.</p>
                  <p>Marriages, formed upon the idea of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection or fortune, although the corruption of the preſent age may ſtyle them marriages of reaſon, in my view, are but legal proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions: Nor can any happineſs be expected but from equality of years, ſimilarity of taſte and mutual eſteem; theſe indeed promiſe a laſting ſatisfaction. Lucretia and myſelf have had ſeveral huſbands pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for us, but we are reſolved to chooſe for ourſelves.</p>
                  <p>Laura is ſo diſobliging to the gentlemen who board with her mamma, that ſhe has gained their general diſeſteem. She has eſtabliſhed it as a maxim, if ſhe obliges them by doing any little thing, they will learn to expect it. Upon this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhe is determined not to indulge them; and flinging back her head with an air, ſays, "It is not her place, and to be ſure ſhe ſhall not do it." A poor conduct for a child to adopt, whoſe mother is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Leaſon has been a long while en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoring to unite Laura and one of her
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:025584_0059_0FCE041BEBE8CC88"/>
boarders, but is not likely to ſucceed. Sincerely do I wiſh the neceſſity of econo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in domeſtic concerns may yet be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt upon the mind of Laura. Few Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ican fortunes can ſupport a woman who is above the calls of her family. Servants, however faithful, ſeldom conſider the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of their employers with that atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they would their own; but if unob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, often bring affluence to poverty. The care of the miſtreſs is therefore neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to prevent prodigality and ruin.</p>

                  <p>AT thoſe moments, my dear Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, when the recollection of paſt events would deſtroy preſent pleaſures, I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the conſolatory language of your friendly letters. Theſe are replete with a balm which ever ſooths the ſeverity of my ſufferings; nor is there a more pleaſing reflection ariſing in the boſom of Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, than that Maria is her friend. Let me ſolicit the continuance of your allevia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting letters.</p>
                  <p>By a few lines, juſt received from my aunt, I am informed of an attempt of ſome perſons to enter her houſe. Fortunately ſhe was at this period afflicted with ſome of her nervous complaints, which deprived her of ſleep, and hearing them as they came into the yard, ſhe called the ſervants, by which circumſtance they were alarmed and made off. The next morning ſhe received the following billet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="62" facs="unknown:025584_0061_0FCE041FB0A09008"/>"Madam,</p>
                  <p>"There is a plan againſt your niece, which, if ſhe continues in Trenton, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt will be put in execution. I am not at liberty to make myſelf known, but ſolicit the young lady to be upon her guard."</p>
                  <p>This information will prevent the grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of many innocent amuſements even in this city; for if Eliza is yet determined to follow me with her reſentment, ſhe can certainly find thoſe in this metropolis cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated for the execution of her plans.</p>
                  <p>The gentleman to whom we were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted for our ſafety at Trenton, has call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon us, and if I am not deceived, he diſcovers a partiality for Lucretia. Mrs. Leaſon is acquainted with him, and has given us his character, embelliſhing it with many a fanciful relation. His attention appears pleaſing to my friend. Miſs Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's behaviour has occaſioned her mamma the loſs of ſome of her beſt boarders. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our good landlady's account, I ſincerely regret it; though ſhe alone is to blame for not inſtilling into the mind of her daughter, early principles of propriety.
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:025584_0062_0FCE042307687430"/>
The firſt ideas impreſt upon the youthful fancy, lay the foundation for their future reputation in life: It is therefore neceſſary the gentle hand of inſtruction ſhould aſſiſt the expanding judgment. Laura is not without her good qualities; but theſe are diſcoloured by the medium through which they paſs. From the cradle, habituated to indulgence, ſhe cannot ſupport the moſt trivial diſappointment. This diſpoſition is of itſelf ſufficient to render her wretched; for diſappointments will intrude upon us, notwithſtanding our whole attention is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to repel them; and no ſooner do we appear on the theatre of life, than we are involved in anxieties.</p>
                  <p>My aunt, I am told, is endeavouring to obtain the influence of her friends, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the way for her return to a huſband, whom ſhe has publicly declared ſhe deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed. Well acquainted with her capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious temper, I am not ſurpriſed at the inconſiſtency of her conduct. Such a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is the prolific parent of miſery, in private and ſocial life. The ſchemes, which, but a few weeks ſince, ſhe purſued with the greateſt avidity, are now the cauſe of her

regret, as they tend to leſſen her own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.</p>
                  <p>By her rigorous meaſures, my uncle has been obliged to quit the elegant man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in which he had long reſided, and to occupy one in every reſpect inferior. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his reduced circumſtances, his haughty ſpirit will not ſuffer him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to a trade in which he had been edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and from which a very reputable living might be derived. He prefers paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the world as a gentleman with a thouſand wants and an empty pocket, rather than reſume the character of a mechanic, which, he fears would exclude him <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

                  <p>Such a connexion as my aunt's, makes me tremble at the diſtant idea of a change in

                  <p>IT is our intention ſhortly to leave this city. From every circumſtance I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a union will ſoon take place between Lucretia and Mr. Wilkins; Mr. Barton having given him permiſſion to attend us to New-York. This gentleman is not a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Philadelphia, but for ſeveral years paſt has tranſacted buſineſs here in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiating line; and having been ſucceſsful in ſpeculation, he has lately connected himſelf with a gentleman in Virginia. His character is, I believe, unexceptionable. Lucretia has frequently converſed with me upon the ſubject. She acknowledges her prepoſſeſſion; but is reſolved, in a matter of ſuch importance, to govern herſelf by the advice of her father who can only be ſolicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for her happineſs.</p>
                  <p>There are few females, Maria, who in the different ſpheres in which they move, more conſpicuouſly irradiate and adorn their characters than this dear girl. She
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:025584_0066_0FCE0429C7069198"/>
was deprived of her mother at an age when ſhe moſt needed her affectionate inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to ſuppreſs the ſpontaneous foibles of youth. Her father, abſorbed in the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of an only child, exerted himſelf to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs her mind with ſentiments which ſhould make her happy; and after ſhe had completed her ſchool education, made her the companion of his leiſure hours. Paſſionately attached to her mother, he reliſhed no amuſements in which Lucretia did not partake; but while he determined to render her the accompliſhed companion, he was alſo convinced, that it was a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part of female education to be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in domeſtic concerns; he therefore urged her attention to the family, in which ſhe cheerfully engaged. If ſhe ſhone in the circles of refined ſentiment, and was acquainted with the etiquette of the gay world, ſhe alſo practiſed, in the boſom of domeſtic duties, virtues which endeared her to every part of the family.</p>
                  <p>Through every action of her life is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed the ſunſhine of tranquillity, but the partial pen of Caroline can never add a plume to the character of Lucretia. Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:025584_0067_0FCE042BD2EB75C8"/>
of a diſpoſition and qualifications to render a deſerving man happy, I ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſh that ſhe may never form a connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion which ſhall mar the enjoyment of her ſucceeding days.</p>
                  <p>There are many families in this place to whom I am attached. It is difficult, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to form a real friendſhip. A true friend is an acquiſition ſeldom to be obtained. Few are to be found calculated for the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of friendly and ſocial intercourſe. When I reflect on my unprotected ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I am not without my gloomy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but Lucretia exerts herſelf to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel them. Mrs. Leaſon frequently diverts us with her matches; ſhe claims the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of having formed the intended connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of our friends. Our landlady is by no means deficient in underſtanding, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a want of prudence runs parallel in her conduct. Connexions, big with importance to our future happineſs, ſhould ever be the reſult of unbiaſſed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſion. For my own part I will never become a proſtituted votary at Hymen's ſhrine; love alone ſhall cement the gentle bandage.</p>

                  <p>IN my laſt letter I forgot to mention the name of my charming Captain. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe this neglect, and give me leave to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce Capt. Evremont, to your particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar friendſhip. I am convinced Maria will give him a corner of her heart, from the attachment ſhe has long poſſeſſed for her Caroline. I ſhould be doubly happy perſonally to preſent him to my friend, that from an acquaintance with him ſhe might ſet a juſt value upon his accompliſhments and virtues; but can only anticipate this event at a future period. His buſineſs with the Secretary at War has detained him in this city much longer than he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; and I have the pleaſure to aſſure my dear Maria, that his breaſt beats conge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial to the fondeſt wiſhes of Caroline's heart. Yes, my friend, we have reſolved one day to form a near and pleaſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion. Flattering as my preſent prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions are, they have opened upon me
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:025584_0071_0FCE043259B5B210"/>
new anxieties and cares. It is truly unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate he ſhould, at this criſis, be obliged to accept a commiſſion, for I underſtand ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, rather than an attachment to the mode of life, has urged him to the ſtep. This gentleman is a native of Boſton, and was early placed by his parents with a reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectable merchant in that place. Soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the difficulties between Great-Britain and America commenced, that capital be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Britiſh garriſon. Trade was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily laid aſide. Thus at an important period was be deprived of his proſpects of buſineſs in future life. Here he ſuffered in the general calamity, and with a number of his fellow citizens was under the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of entering the army, where he contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued until the cloſe of the war. Upon the war breaking out with the Indians, he again accepted a commiſſion merely for a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. Being however engaged, it will not do for him to retreat, until the preſent campaign is decided. The honour of a ſoldier, you know, is held dearer than his life. May the American army be the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar care of Providence, and the goddeſs of health diffuſe her ſmiles upon them.

                  <p>YOU complain of my ſilence; and add, three poſts have arrived without a line from your friend. The omiſſion is by no means conſonant with the dictates of my heart. Such indeed has been my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbered ſituation, that it has been out of my power to gratify my moſt favourite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination. But you have no right to doubt my friendſhip. No; that heaven-born ſpark has long been kindling in my breaſt its extatic blaze. I thank you for the pleaſing retroſpect of our infant friendſhip. Thoſe days, indeed, were inexpreſſibly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py which were illumed with your ſociety. The tender bud expanded under your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigorating influence, and received a ſolid baſis for its eternal exiſtence. Yes, my dear, it is not a meteor dancing in the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venile fancy, but a creative ſun, which animates every dormant virtue, and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies every unfolding plant. Every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſince my arrival in New-York, has
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:025584_0074_0FCE04379C2BBF08"/>
been devoted to Lucretia; and we are ſtill buſy in preparing for the intended union. Mr. Barton, previous to our arrival, had written to his correſpondent in Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, and obtained ſatisfactory informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reſpecting Mr. Wilkins, and has been pleaſed to give his approbation to an early day for the celebration of the nuptials. Mr. Wilkins's buſineſs calling him to Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, where he propoſes to ſettle at a place called Havre-de-Grace, I have promiſed to accompany them. Having no partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular attachment to Philadelphia, I think it probable I ſhall tarry with them a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time. This, I flatter myſelf will not always be the caſe; I begin to think it beſt to have ſome one to provide for and protect me. Old age will come, and the epithet of old maid is, you know, a ſtigma, the appellation of which I will, if poſſible, avoid.</p>
                  <p>I received a letter from Capt. Evremont, dated Fort-Pitt. He regrets his preſent engagements with the army, but flatters himſelf the troops raiſing by Congreſs, will in one campaign, put a period to the war. Sincerely do I wiſh this may not prove an
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:025584_0075_0FCE043AD6086180"/>
illuſive hope; but I fear they will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. We have long habituated our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to conſider the Indians as an inſignif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icant enemy, who are to be ſilenced by toys; it is now, however, policy to view them as a formidable body. Mr. Evre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont adds, "it is generally believed the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predations which the frontiers have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced for years paſt, have been inſtigated by the garriſon at Detroit:" If ſo, it is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly probable they will afford them every neceſſary ſupply. Fortunately my reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are taken off from theſe painful ideas, by my preſent avocations. I have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a letter from my aunt Noble, complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our taking the rout to New-York, through Burlington, Bordentown, and Amboy, and inſiſting on our making her houſe, in our way back to Philadelphia. The reaſons for purſuing this road were not to avoid a repetition of her grievances, but that we might have an opportunity of ſeeing this part of the country; having gratified our curioſity, we intend to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge her with a flying viſit. She men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſome new circumſtances relative to Eliza, and ſolicits me to be upon my guard.
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:025584_0076_0FCE043C1ECAEF40"/>
I flatter myſelf my journey to Havre-de-Grace will prove my ſecurity. At that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, I ſhall conſider myſelf free from her perſecutions. I am called down ſtairs, and muſt, for the preſent, lay aſide my pen—</p>
                  <p>When I entered the parlour I ſaw a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel young man ſitting with Lucretia, who bowing her head as I croſſed to a chair, ſaid, "This, Sir, is the lady for whom you were inquiring." He aroſe, and addreſſing me, obſerved, his brother, Capt. Evremont, when in Philadelphia a few weeks ſince, by letter, had requeſted him, as he paſſed through New-York, on his way to the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to call upon his intended ſiſter: I therefore, Miſs, agreeably to his wiſhes, introduce myſelf to you. I aſſured him of the ſatisfaction his viſit afforded, and made every inquiry after his connexions, which politeneſs dictated. His viſit was ſhort. Lucretia invited him to dine the next day; but pleading a previous engagement, we were deprived of his company. He begged I would heighten his reception at Fort-Pitt, by honouring him with the charge of a letter, ſaying he ſhould call upon me the next evening for my commands, as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:025584_0077_0FCE043D9C4CA8D0"/>
to leave the city immediately. Capt. Evremont had mentioned his broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's being ſoon expected with recruits, and obtained my promiſe of writing by him. Pleaſed with ſo favourable an opportunity, I entruſted him with a lengthy letter, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete with encomiums upon my intended brother. I ſincerely regretted his ſhort ſtay in New-York, as it deprived me of the happineſs of being fully acquainted with his merits. But a ſoldier, my dear, is not the maſter of his time; nor can he impede the flying moments. I directed him to Mrs. Leaſon's, as a good boarding houſe, while he tarried in Philadelphia.</p>
                  <p>How does the heaving ſigh ſwell my agitated boſom, at the anticipation of the dangers which await my friends: Yet, amidſt my diſtreſſing thoughts, a beam of hope darts its animating rays, and gives me infinite ſupport.</p>
                  <p>I have written you a lengthy letter; accept it as a token of my friendſhip; and may virtue, that fair daughter of heaven, deſcend and illume our path through the wilderneſs of life, and ſweetening the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections of expiring moments, accompany us to the bright region of uninterrupted bliſs.</p>

                  <p>LUCRETIA, the amiable, the charming Lucretia, has now entered the liſt of matrons. The indiſſoluble knot is tied. The wedding was private; but we have yet to receive the congratulations of a numerous acquaintance.</p>
                  <p>Our levee is crouded, and I am obliged to obtrude upon thoſe hours, uſually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to Morpheus, or deprive myſelf of the gratification of writing to my dear Maria, whoſe happineſs is ever interwoven with Caroline's. This ſaid matrimony is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious thing; it makes me thoughtful. But I fancy I am more diſpoſed to be ſerious, from the unhappy connexion of my aunt. It may, however, teach me an important leſſon; a leſſon, upon which the happineſs of my future life depends, never to connect myſelf with a man, whoſe ignorance diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualifies him for an agreeable companion. The moſt ignorant are, in general, the moſt
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:025584_0079_0FCDE9D7645B1D18"/>
tenacious; and poſſeſs ſuch high ideas of their imaginary excellencies, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not allow any merit to their friends. A handſome, face, an engaging perſon, will be additionally pleaſing to my taſte; but I flatter myſelf, they will never faſcinate my judgment; nor the more captivating allurements of riches, infatuate my mind.</p>
                  <p>Virtues, emitted in the calm walks of ſocial life, render pleaſant the hours of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, and are alone calculated to inſure domeſtic happineſs. Wiſdom is the lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary of the mind; and, by her enlivening powers, diſſipates thoſe painful ſenſations, which are ſpontaneous, in the boſom of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. Ignorance is the fruitful parent of every ungenerous principle.</p>
                  <p>To be connected with a man of inferior underſtanding to my own, would excite reflections which would imbitter life. Yet how many of thoſe matches do we daily ſee. Strange that we ſhould be thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. It is ſaid the little urchin is blind, and this is all the apology that can be made for us. We frequently, however, purchaſe our ſight by a fatal ſacrifice. Pray heaven,
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:025584_0080_0FCE04439C098D20"/>
it may never be the lot of Caroline, or her friend, to be thus wretchedly united.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Wilkins is ſenſible, genteel, and accompliſhed. I am not ſkilled in phiſiog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, but fear he is avaricious and impet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous. If ſo, it muſt caſt a ſable cloud over their domeſtic pleaſures; for the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Lucretia, is nobly generous. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ucated in the ſunſhine of fortune, ſhe has been enabled to indulge the emanations of a heart, replete with humanity. She has ever ſought objects of diſtreſs, and alleviated ſuch as were ſuffering with cheerleſs pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. This diſpoſition is ſo ſeldom implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the boſom of affluence, that its ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion would give me pain. The pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Lucretia, will ever dictate an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcence with the will of her huſband, and ſhe will readily relinquiſh many little dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orations, which might be added to her own perſon, privately to gratify her god-like propenſity. I will not anticipate, what may never take place: This will be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolizing a double portion of trouble. Away with this bane to happineſs. Let us take the incidents as they ariſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and, by confining our ideas within the dictates of
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:025584_0081_0FCE04461C291B40"/>
reaſon, we ſhall at leaſt enſure preſent peace.</p>
                  <p>Unfortunately, I was for ſome time edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by a perſon, whoſe peculiar pleaſure it was to colour, with the moſt gloomy ſhades, every expected event. This occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned an early averſion in my mind to anticipation.</p>
                  <p>Many uſeful leſſons are to be learnt from obſervation, and great is the danger of contracting bad habits. Had not my judgement been directed by my deceaſed uncle and aunt, there is no doubt but I ſhould have imbibed that diſpoſition, ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to the enjoyment of life. At the early period in which I was placed under the protection of my aunt Noble, my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was not ſufficiently expanded, to decide for myſelf. Thoſe youth, who are within the limits of enlightened inſtruction, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive inexpreſſible advantages. Thus the friendly hints of my uncle and aunt Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, led me to reflect upon many foibles, and armed me againſt the rock, upon which my aunt Noble's domeſtic happineſs ſplit. I have long ſince been convinced of the folly of conſidering the world at large as
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:025584_0082_0FCE04475F014950"/>
our friends; to ſuppoſe all who hear our troubles, muſt conſequently become ſharers in them, ſtrongly evinces a vacant mind. Relating domeſtic difficulties abroad, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the rules of ſocial happineſs, and repugnant to every principle of polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Should I ever become a parent, be aſſured, it ſhall be my early endeavour, to check in the youthful mind, every propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to a communicative unguarded diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; and above all, I will impreſs the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of keeping all family matters ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred.</p>
                  <p>I have not dwelt thus upon the ſubject, becauſe I think you need the leſſon; but as the obſervations naturally occurred, I felt no wiſh to reſtrain them.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not write you again, until I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at Philadelphia, from whence we ſhall go by land to Virginia. Keep your heart for ſome deſerving youth, whoſe united virtues, ſhall inſure your happineſs.</p>

                  <p>HAVING paſſed through the uſual ceremonies of receiving the congratulatory viſits of our acquaintances, we haſtened to this city, where we muſt again ſubmit to that ridiculous parade, cuſtom has eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed upon theſe occaſions. In my view, nothing is ſo fooliſh as the ſitting ourſelves up for a ſhow, and becoming an object of animadverſion. It is a ceremony I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to diſpenſe with, however oppoſed to the ideas of the world; for I can never conſent to a form ſo contrary to my feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſo derogatory to my judgement. To comply with it, requires more fortitude and patience than has fallen to my ſhare. Our taſk, however, will not be ſo ſevere as at New-York. Morning viſits will be ſhort, and we have no time to devote to afternoon company. This circumſtance will alſo relieve Mr. Wilkins.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Leaſon received us with great po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs. I have made inquiries of her,
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:025584_0084_0FCE044BED960F28"/>
reſpecting my intended brother, as I rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ommended him to her houſe for lodgings, but can obtain no information of him. It is probable he fell in with company upon the road, who introduced him elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>Several weeks have elapſed, ſince I heard from Capt. Evremont. His ſilence is uncommon; and gives me great anxiety; nor can thoſe amuſements to which I have long been partial, or the joyful event of Lucretia's union, obliterate my fears. I am much indiſpoſed. There is an inexpreſſible ſympathy between the mind and body; they are mutually affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Hope is the anodyne of life, a balm to the afflicted, and an animating meteor, which diſſipates the dew of diſappointment; but fear, by depreſſing the ſpirits, brings on diſeaſe, which often terminates life. I love to get by myſelf. Reflection is pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. To drop a tear upon the recollection of my friends, is a luxury to my ſoul. Friendſhip, true friendſhip, is a child of heaven.</p>
                  <p>Agreeably to promiſe, we made Trenton in our way to this city, and found my aunt, as uſual, complaining. Our viſit was
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:025584_0085_0FCE044D6454B860"/>
ſhort; Lucretia politely gave her an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to viſit her at Havre-de-Grace. An invitation I doubt not but ſhe will accept; ſome premonition will tell her the journey will be of ſervice, and point out a thouſand chimerical advantages. Civility is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a tyrant, which compels us to do many things contrary to our wiſhes. You muſt excuſe the ſhortneſs of this letter.

                  <p>THE gloom which pervaded my mind when I laſt addreſſed you, has ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided. I have been gratified with a letter from Capt. Evremont. It had laid in the war office more than a week. He does not mention his brother. I ſuſpect there is ſome deception in this affair.</p>
                  <p>My aunt has repeatedly aſſured me, no meaſures were unpurſued by Eliza to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain my letters, and that through this chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, ſhe becomes acquainted with my pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate intentions.</p>
                  <p>I am gaining ſtrength, and hope, I ſhall ſoon be able to attend Lucretia home: She has been particularly attentive to me in my indiſpoſition. By her perſuaſions I conſented to call in a phyſician, who has had the impudence to ſtyle my diſorder <hi>nervous.</hi> A pretty cuſtom of the faculty, to claſs thoſe complaints, which they have not ſufficient abilities to remove, under this denomination! By placing the diſeaſe
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:025584_0087_0FCE0451B7BE08E8"/>
upon thoſe delicate organs, they conclude, ſhould their applications be unſucceſsful, their patients cannot cenſure their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and they will thereby elude reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>There is not, in creation, an epithet more wounding to my feelings. To be <hi>nervous,</hi> is generally to be a <hi>fool</hi>; a <hi>plague</hi> to ourſelves and a <hi>torment</hi> to our friends. Could I poſſibly think myſelf ſo devoid of ſtability, ſo deſtitute of philoſophy, ſo depraved in my mind, I would inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeek ſome unfrequented receſs, where mortal eye ſhould never reach me.</p>
                  <p>The ſagacious doctor had no ſooner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined my diſeaſe, than my reſentment was excited. I immediately diſcarded his preſcriptions, and refuſed his farther attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. If that is the caſe, ſaid I, away with phyſicians; medicines are debilitating, reſolution ſhall be my cure; I will never be cheated of the pleaſures of life, by ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous diſorders. Since this determination, my amendment has been rapid. Profit by the leſſon, Maria, and be aſſured, reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the ſtrongeſt antidote that can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be adminiſtered, in nervous attacks.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="89" facs="unknown:025584_0088_0FCE0452A2F3FF80"/>By encouraging the mind in rational purſuits, it ſoon becomes ſtrengthened; a ſucceſſion of entertaining, improving ſtud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies, will ward off dejection.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Wilkins has written to his partner at Havre-de-Grace to ſecure lodgings until his furniture ſhall arrive from New-York; which was to have been ſhipped ſoon after we left that city.</p>
                  <p>My indiſpoſition prevents me from ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the congratulations of our friends; upon Lucretia's account I regret it. The warm wiſh of my heart is, for her uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted happineſs. May their joys be mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and proſperity ever illume their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of life.</p>
                  <p>Unfortunately for Mrs. Leaſon, Laura is abſent from home, conſequently a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble attention devolves upon her. Could you ſee this taſty widow, whoſe grey hairs, denote her advanced years, decorated in all the gaiety of youth, I am ſure your ſentiments would accord with mine. Nothing expreſſes a want of judgment, more, than not complying with a dreſs ſuited to declining life. The gaieties of youth, ſhould certainly be laid aſide, as
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:025584_0089_0FCE04F25B3D1948"/>
that period retires, and the ſober habili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of advanced age aſſumed.</p>
                  <p>Good ſenſe will ever diſcover itſelf throughout our conduct, but in nothing more conſpicuouſly than this. I have frequently ſeen the picture of a very aged lady, ſeated at her toilet, who by the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of her dreſſing maid (from whoſe countenance a ſtriking leſſon might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced) is decorating herſelf in all the fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a young lady, juſt entering upon the theatre of life. In my view, this repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, is as ſevere a ſarcaſm upon the ſex, as can poſſibly be portrayed. I wiſh to purchaſe it for Mrs. Leaſon, and am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, if I can ever obtain it, to preſent it to her. Such characters diſcover minds as unimproved as the deſarts of Lybia. Old age is indeed a deſolating period, if the illuminating beams of wiſdom have not dawned upon the mind; but if ſhe irradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates the underſtanding, we can view the cloſe of life with reſignation. And having paſſed the errors of youth, we may, through the eye of reaſon, anticipate increaſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and approaching death, with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar ſerenity.</p>

                  <p>WE arrived here the 20th inſtant. The journey has been of infinite ſervice to my health. I am extremely pleaſed with this town. It is ſituated upon a moſt delightful river, and appears deſigned, by Nature, for trade.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Wilkins's houſe is peculiarly pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, as it commands an extenſive proſpect. The furniture has not arrived. We are at preſent in the family of Mrs. Gardner; I will introduce them to my Maria. This la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy has been ſome years a widow, left with three daughters and two ſons; the two eldeſt girls are the epitome of their mother. It may be expected, that children, educat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſame parent, ſhould imbibe ſimilar ſentiments and habits.</p>
                  <p>But this family demonſtrates, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, unaſſiſted by art, frequently implants principles in the youthful breaſt, far ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to the moſt refined ſtudy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="98" facs="unknown:025584_0092_0FCE0457DAC875E8"/>Mrs. G. is a woman of great ambition, with a high opinion of her own abilities, ſhe prides herſelf upon the ſuppoſed reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of her character, boaſts much of her domeſtic economy, aſſumes a large ſhare of merit from the richneſs of her clothing, exerts herſelf to be thought a learned wom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and aims to monopolize reſpect from the idea of keeping the beſt company in the place.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the juſt traits in the character of my landlady and her eldeſt daughters.</p>
                  <p>Educated in ſuch ſentiments, it is not ſurpriſing, that dreſſing and viſiting, are the favourite employments of the young ladies, who are particularly remarked for being in the ſtreets. Fond of being ſeen, they inquire from ſhop to ſhop, for articles they have no intention to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe. But ſhopping is a charming amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; it gives them an opportunity to ſhew themſelves abroad. They deſpiſe every thing "wulgar," and their friends are the "moſt affableſt," and the "moſt agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt" in the world.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Gardner and her daughter's lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quacity might be overlooked, if every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:025584_0093_0FCE045A27C88A30"/>
was not tortured by an ignorance of their own language.</p>
                  <p>Had you been at table a few days ſince, you would have been diverted; it was diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to refrain from laughing. Having dined, Mrs. Gardner filled her glaſs, and paſſing the wine, requeſted the company to drink "a good huſband to <hi>orphan</hi> wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ows." I heſitated; for had my life de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, I could not imagine what ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhe meant to convey. I however repeated the toaſt. Anxious to avoid laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and in haſte to diſpenſe with the wine, I choaked myſelf, and was obliged to leave the room; glad indeed of an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to retire. Lucretia improved the moment, and followed me up chamber, where we had high diverſion.</p>
                  <p>Fanny, the youngeſt daughter, is a very different character. Delicate in her beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, enlightened in her underſtanding, ſhe ſpeaks with propriety, determines with judgment, and poſſeſſes a peculiar ſoftneſs of diſpoſition, which, like the gentle luſtre of the evening ſtar, beams in her expreſſive eye. Theſe ſecure her the partiality of the boarders; and her attention to their little
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:025584_0094_0FCE045B9AB8F140"/>
wants, enhances her in their eſteem. Her mind indeed, is an aſſemblage of virtues. I am not fond of adopting new friends, but there is in this dear girl, ſomething ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging, ſo congenial with my feelings, that I am reſolved to endear myſelf to her, and, if poſſible, to become neceſſary to her happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. She appears to poſſeſs a natural vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity, which is at preſent clouded, by ſome unhappy event. If this is the caſe, time, and aſſiduity, ſhall diſcover it.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Gardner's eldeſt ſon is a man of fortune; it is, therefore, unneceſſary to add a man of friends. Although encircled by the faſcinating ſmiles of this pleaſing deity, he claims no pretenſions to happineſs. Poſſeſſing an anxious, parſimonious diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he is deprived of thoſe tranquil ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which produce gratitude. Never having ſipped of diſappointment's bitter cup, his heart is callous to the tears of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. Abſorbed in the purſuit of wealth, many ſocial virtues lie dormant. Perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, leaſt his plans in buſineſs ſhould prove unſucceſsful, he cannot reliſh preſent bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and from an unhappy temper contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually ſuffers imaginary difficulties. Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:025584_0095_0FCE045D1A2ED5C8"/>
rather augment than leſſen his anxiety. He is a ſtranger to that real enjoyment, which thoſe experience, whoſe boſoms are melio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by humanity, and irradiated with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence. Contentment, that maid of heavenly origin, abſconds his mental re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and takes her reſidence in the more ſerene heart. When we ſee thoſe who have been nurſed in the indulgent lap of fortune, deprived of tempers to enjoy her gifts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly agitated and diſtreſſed, we certainly cannot envy their poſſeſſions. It will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the obſervation that money alone is inſufficient to ſecure peace.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Gardner is unmarried, and free from every incumbrance; he wants only a mind to enjoy the abundance which Prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idence has poured upon him.</p>
                  <p>His brother is married, and has a large family dependant on him. There is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in his countenance which excites the tendereſt feelings of my heart. He is, I believe, a child of ſorrow. Having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged myſelf in repeated converſations with him, I am deceived if he does not poſſeſs a good underſtanding, a ſincere ſoul, and a feeling mind. Every new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:025584_0096_0FCE0460856600F8"/>
increaſes my partiality; but theſe are my own obſervations: For nothing is more difficult than aſcertaining from the world the true character of an unfortunate man. Adverſity is a cloud which too ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually conceals many real virtues.</p>

                  <p>SINCE I laſt addreſſed my dear Maria, I have had an opportunity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming more acquainted with the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Mr. Gardner. Fanny entered my chamber this morning, and requeſted me to favour her with ſome entertaining books. There was a number upon my table: I deſired her to ſelect ſuch as would be pleaſing to her. Engaged in reading, ſhe had reached the door; when looking up and ſeeing but a ſmall pamphlet in her hand, I aſked her, if there were none con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant with her taſte? Her heart was full; the pearly tear gliſtened in her eyes: She could not articulate. Fanny, continued I, what diſtreſſes you? Believe me your friend; unboſom your affliction. She in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to retire. I aroſe, took her hand, and led her to a chair; ſhe laid the book upon the table; I glanced my eyes upon it, and found it a play, entitled, "The
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:025584_0098_0FCE046333BB6880"/>
Brothers." Curioſity was excited; my attachment for her increaſed; I experienc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all that inexpreſſible ſympathy, which is united with thoſe ſweet ſenſations of a feeling mind, and was ſilent for ſome min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utes, that ſhe might give vent to the effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of her grief. Tears having afforded a momentary relief, I reſumed my ſolicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, aſſuring her of my prepoſeſſions; obſerving, I had noticed an anxiety upon her countenance, the cauſe of which, if poſſible, it was my wiſh to remove. She replied, "I thank you for your friendſhip; nor can I refuſe your requeſt. The title of that book, forced upon me many diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable ideas, by reminding me of the ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of my brothers; the youngeſt of whom has experienced a ſucceſſion of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes. Long initiated in the ſchool of ſevere diſappointment, with the moſt eco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomical attention, and cloſeſt induſtry, he finds it difficult to ſupport his family; yet his deſtitute circumſtances make no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon the heart of Charles, who, by great ſucceſs, has accumulated immenſe property. Intoxicated by the inebriating bowl of proſperity, he lives only for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>

He views, with an adamantine indifference, the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of a deſerving family, without a ſingle effort to relieve them. The unpardonable inſenſibility he uniformly diſcovers to the embarraſſments of a brother, adds a barb to the dart of misfortune. The pain which reſults from the inattention of our connexions, is too ſevere for a ſuſceptible mind. To meet indifference, where we expected aſſiſtance, deſtroys the fond hope nature excites.</p>

heaven has immediately connected us. But ſympathy never filled the eye of my broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with a generous tear; nor has human<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity meliorated the inſenſibility of his heart." Here ſhe pauſed. I urged her to ſuppreſs feelings ſo deſtructive to her health. Let us anticipate your brother's better fortune. Hope is the cordial of life. Encourage the friendly deluſion: It will aſſiſt you in conquering thoſe reflections ſo prejudicial to you. She was now called.</p>
                  <p>The great contraſt in this family fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently engaged my reflection. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed happy for ſociety that characters, ſimilar to Mr. Gardner's, are not more frequent.

                  <p>I HAVE at length the ſatisfaction of addreſſing Maria, from the houſe of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretia. It gives me infinite pleaſure to ſee her engaged in the regulations of her fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily. Her diſpoſition is well calculated to enjoy life. If ſhe ſhone as a daughter, and a miſtreſs while with her father, as a wife, ſhe is worthy the cloſeſt imitation. Adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſweetneſs, crowned with virtues, and dignified with ſentiment, from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of domeſtic life, ſhe ſhines with an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive radiance. It is her ſtudy to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate herſelf to the diſpoſition of Mr. Wilkins, and her conſtant endeavour to render him happy. If ſhe has not found in him all ſhe fondly imagined, ſhe pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently conceals it. Solomon, celebrated for his wiſdom, declares, that "Among a thouſand women, he had not found one deſerving the name of <hi>wife.</hi>" Mr. Wilkins then, is peculiarly bleſt. I fear he is inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to the value of the prize. His hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:025584_0103_0FCE046C0BDB2BE8"/>
appears detached from domeſtic pleaſures. We have but little of his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; his fondneſs for variety, renders home diſtaſteful to him. The aſſiduity and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the lover, is ſuperſeded by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable neglect. The woman who a ſhort time ſince engroſſed every pleaſurea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble idea, he now views without emotion; and, I ſometimes think, returns to, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret. Buſineſs engages his daily attention, and the tavern his leiſure hours; but Mr. Wilkins is not an unfaſhionable huſband. In this era of politeneſs, to ſee a man at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to his wife, denotes a weakneſs, which renders him an object of contempt. Love at preſent is a paſſion but little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. The gentlemen abſorbed in ſome ſtriking attachment, generally believe themſelves caught in the alluring ſnare, and reſolve to obtain the object of their ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed affection. Their favourite wiſh accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, they frequently diſcover their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, too late to retrieve the error, and thus become wretched for life. Happy marriages would be more frequent, were the firſt impulſe to ariſe, from the percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:025584_0104_0FCE046D029CBB50"/>
of certain innate virtues; theſe would expand the tender paſſion.</p>
                  <p>Love is the offspring of a vigorous fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: It is born of youth, and if nurſed with care, will, in the calm ſunſhine of declining life, meliorate into the ſublimeſt friendſhip. Having been matured by reciprocal confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and mutual eſteem, it ſoftens the winter of old age. The pleaſing emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which reſult from ſo refined a ſource, are unknown to thoſe, whoſe minds have been enervated by diſſipation, and poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by vice. He only, whoſe happineſs is centered in a deſerving family, can realize the bliſs.</p>
                  <p>I have received ſeveral letters from Capt. Evremont, dated Fort Pitt. The laſt mentions the arrival of his brother, but does not acknowledge the receipt of the letter I wrote by him. I am flattered with the proſpect of ſeeing him, as he expects to viſit Philadelphia, with diſpatches to the War Office. Exceedingly I regret his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements in the military line, and ſincerely wiſh he could retire from the ſcene of war, with honour; but this is impoſſible. My heart is his faithful attendant. By the
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:025584_0105_0FCE046E731B5BD8"/>
papers, we find troops continually upon their march to that quarter: I dread the event.</p>
                  <p>A letter from my aunt is juſt hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me. She complains of her ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, declares it impracticable to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port herſelf, upon the ſmall ſtipend ſhe annually receives, and reſolves to attempt a reconciliation with her huſband. The rapid increaſe of her indiſpoſition makes her anxious to be with thoſe "whoſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it is to provide, and attend upon her. But ſome obſtacles are previouſly to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. The children muſt be baniſhed from home; ſhe did not marry them and is determined never to live with them. It is the duty of a man, to make every ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to the happineſs of his wife." This novel method of reaſoning, ſhe has adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is mortifying to my feelings. I cannot believe a man muſt diſcard all affection for his children, to gratify an unreaſonable woman. Should ſhe obtain her wiſhes, and be received upon the terms propoſed, with a diſpoſition naturally iraſcible, a reconciliation will but little affect her hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. She urges me to addreſs my uncle
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:025584_0106_0FCE0471B99CFA48"/>
upon the ſubject of her return; but I am decidedly reſolved to have no hand in the affair.</p>
                  <p>Her annual income is amply compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to a genteel ſupport, would ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe economy, and learn the diſtinction between a prodigal, and a liberal mind; but poſſeſſing an extravagant inclination, ſhe is led into a thouſand unneceſſary expenſes.</p>
                  <p>I find ſome of Clarimont's relations are in this place. They are people in genteel life: I wiſh exceedingly to be acquainted with them, that I may remove from their minds, prejudices imbibed againſt me.</p>
                  <p>The unfortunate ſituation of Mrs. Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dner's youngeſt ſon, excites in my breaſt, many painful emotions. The advantages of a large fortune, are inconſiderable, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive of the power it gives, of imparting happineſs to the diſtreſſed. A mind right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected by the bounty of heaven, will never feel happier, than when engaged in leſſening the wants of deſerving poverty.</p>
                  <p>I am grateful to Providence, that I have it in my power, to afford ſome ſmall relief, to the family of Mr. Gardner. From re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated converſations with Fanny, I find his mind delicate and ſuſceptible. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:025584_0107_0FCE0472E38ACCF8"/>
favours upon ſuch, is painful as well as pleaſing. A trifle given by the truly hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and benevolent, will afford infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more ſatisfaction to the feeling mind, than a thouſand times its value, preſented by the hand of indelicacy, or the air of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance. Such favours I have often ſeen, and my heart has bled, for the unhappy dependant. I am ſorry to obſerve, few know how to confer obligations. The children of adverſity ſurely have ſufficient to bear, without the addition of unfeeling favours. I was ſome time at a loſs how to preſent the trifle I intended to beſtow; but finally adopted the idea of addreſſing a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to him, with a bank bill encloſed, which I ſent to the poſt-office: This, I flatter myſelf, will relieve him from his preſent difficulties. Through Fanny, I ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his neceſſities; and when I hear from my agent in Philadelphia, it will be in my power further to aſſiſt him.</p>
                  <p>There is a report circulating in this place, that my couſin, who was left heir with me, to my uncle's eſtate, is a priſoner with the Indians; and not killed as was ſuppoſed, at the defeat of Major Willis. The ſtory

Evremont upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; ſoliciting him, if poſſible, to obtain a knowledge of the affair, and if true, to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any ranſom they will accept for him. Perhaps, by employing the friendly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, information may be received. The idea of his ſufferings, if ſtill among them, frequently invades my heart, and ſhades my momentary pleaſures.

                  <p>IT is impoſſible, Maria, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint ourſelves with either the foibles or virtues of mankind, unleſs we follow them to private life. In public, deception en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robes their actions. A wiſh to ſecure the good opinion of the world, induces them to conceal their imperfections, and they often eſtabliſh a falſe reputation. But when retired from the eye of cenſure and criticiſm, caution lies dormant, and the actions are ſhaded by natural vices, or il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumed with enviable virtues.</p>
                  <p>I am hourly convinced of the juſtneſs of theſe obſervations, notwithſtanding the exertions of Lucretia, to conceal the fretful, penurious <hi>diſpoſition</hi> of Mr. Wilkins. His <hi>circumſtances</hi> cannot occaſion him to be parſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious, or ill-natured; for his fortune is eaſy, and his proſpects flattering. Yet in his family he is contracted: He lives with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:025584_0110_0FCE04789765B348"/>
company; not from a wiſh to be alone. The ſocial principles are ſtrongly interwov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in his heart, and he has it amply in his power, to gratify a diſpoſition ſo conge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial to human nature. But he ſeeks pleaſures abroad. Domeſtic life, to him is diveſted of charms; yet Lucretia is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly the ſame engaging woman; and with a voice, ſoftened by ſincere affection, ſhe ever meets him with a ſweetneſs pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to herſelf.</p>
                  <p>I yeſterday went unexpectedly into her chamber, and found her in tears. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed at a circumſtance ſo uncommon, my curioſity was excited. Shall there, ſaid I, be any incident in the life of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretia, with which ſhe will not acquaint Caroline? The chryſtal drop trembled in her eye; ſhe was ſilent. Going to her, I ſeized her hand, and putting it to my lips, the pearly tear bedewed the ſweet impreſſion; "until you evince your confidence I muſt be wretched; wherein have I forfeited your friendſhip?" Her eyes were fixed upon me; and beaming with an additional expreſſion, ſhe replied, "Your friendly endeavours to extenuate my ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:025584_0111_0FCE04799B255B28"/>
add a ſweet ingredient to this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary indulgence. But there are, my dear, many occurrences which take place, intereſting only to ourſelves. It would, therefore, be cruel to impart them to friends, only to allay their pleaſures. Upon this principle, you will excuſe my ſilence."</p>
                  <p>There can be no circumſtance, I obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the life of Lucretia, which does not deeply intereſt my heart. Your ſilence is too diſtreſſing. "I have no cauſe," ſhe continued, "to diſtruſt a confidence, long deſervedly placed in the boſom of Caroline; but you muſt pardon my refuſing to render you unhappy. Remember I am now a wife. The little ſecrets once intruſted to you, as they concerned no one but my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, I was at liberty to divulge; but it is now my duty to be ſilent: Nor are you unacquainted with my ſentiments. And as I cannot deviate from principles ſo well eſtabliſhed, you will require no further apology for my refuſal."</p>
                  <p>Convinced her happineſs was interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the behaviour of Mr. Wilkins, I could no longer urge her to a conduct we
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:025584_0112_0FCE047CCC85B040"/>
had ſo often reprobated in my aunt Noble; and commending her reſolution, left the chamber.</p>
                  <p>It is ſeldom, perſons of ſimilar inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions become united. Should it be the will of the Deity to connect me with a man poſſeſſing ſentiments eſſentially oppoſed to mine, may I copy from Lucretia. In early life I have been turned aſide from the flowery path of gaiety and indulgence, by the invidious temper of Eliza; but I will not take the painful retroſpect. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agination is the miſtreſs of happineſs. I will flatter myſelf, ſucceeding days will ſmile upon me, and by encouraging the fond idea, enjoy my preſent bleſſings: Among theſe, I claſs Maria's friendſhip; this ever affords me inexpreſſible pleaſure.</p>

                  <p>MANY phantoms of happineſs, have danced upon my imagination, which have vaniſhed before enjoyed; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I exert myſelf, to extenuate the evils of life, I find it impoſſible to ſecure my pleaſures.

                  <p>A few evenings ſince, hurt by ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections Mr. Wilkins caſt upon Lucretia, I retired to my chamber. The weather was extremely warm, my window open, and the curtain down. Inclined to indulge the ſenſations I then experienced, I left the room without a light, and had ſet ſome minutes regretting his unhappy irritability, when my attention was called to the ſound of my name in the ſtreet; and cautiouſly removing the curtain, I ſaw two perſons, at a little diſtance from the gate, engaged in converſation; but notwithſtanding my cloſeſt attention, I heard only interrupted
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:025584_0114_0FCE047F9B0DEF10"/>
ſentences. "By your aſſiſtance, the plan cannot fail of ſucceſs," was ſufficient to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite my fears, and hurrying down ſtairs, I intended to ſend the girl to diſcover who they were, but not finding her, the thought immediately occurred, that ſhe was engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt me. I haſtened into the parlour, and obſerving Lucretia had been in tears, made no mention of the affair, until the next day, when I communicated it to her and Mr. Wilkins: They ſtrongly impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed caution upon me. This circumſtance at preſent is enrobed in myſtery.</p>
                  <p>I am unwilling to believe Eliza ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to purſue me. Her diſpoſition will deprive me of the little happineſs allotted to human life. I regret that one of our ſex ſhould poſſeſs ſentiments ſo oppoſite to that delicacy, ſoftneſs and humanity, which are their moſt pleaſing characteriſtics. But ſhades are neceſſary to give beauty to a picture; and the diſguſting features of this unhappy woman, will tend to brighten ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding characters.

                  <p>IN my laſt, I mentioned my over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearing part of a converſation, as I ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, between the maid and a ſtranger at the gate, which excited painful ſuſpicions in my mind; theſe were not without founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Wilkins being obliged to go to Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timore upon buſineſs, Mrs. Wilkins and myſelf, in his abſence, made a viſit to a Mrs. Drayton, who lives ſome diſtance from us, where we paſſed the evening. In return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home, we were under the neceſſity of croſſing a loneſome place, called Long-Acre. There being only one gentleman with us; many diſagreeable ideas loitered upon my mind, from the recollection of there having been ſeveral robberies lately committed upon this ſpot. The evening was clear and ſerene. The penſive moon had early retired from the ſpangled hemiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere, and was journeying in ſome other clime. The way through this place was
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:025584_0117_0FCE0486DA1ED038"/>
ſo narrow, it was impoſſible we could walk together. Politeneſs dictating I ſhould reſign our gallant to Lucretia, I cautiouſly went a little before. Soon obſerving two perſons coming towards me, I walked ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for Mrs. Wilkins and Mr. Lee to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take me, fancying myſelf ſecure with them immediately behind.</p>
                  <p>A gentleman now came up, and calling me by name, begged I would accept his arm. I thanked him, and declined; aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, he had the advantage of me. He replied, "I have frequently had the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of being in your company at Mrs. Gardner's, and am ſorry you have ſo ſoon forgot a fellow boarder." I begged his pardon, urging the evening as an apology for my inattention, and accepted his offer. Nor was I a little gratified in having addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional company. We ſoon reached the corner of a ſtreet, which he recommended me to take, as being much nearer to Mrs. Wilkins's. Infatuation had lulled my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions. I complied with his requeſt. Nor did my fears return, until I had paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a conſiderable way in this road: It then occurred to me I was deceived. I was
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:025584_0118_0FCE0487E6260978"/>
now in a remote, unfrequented ſpot, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſed no houſe ſince we turned the corner. I at this moment recollected that the perſon, who was with my deceiver, parted from him, juſt before he came up with me, and I already believed myſelf in the power of a woman, whoſe reſentment I dreaded, yet dared not diſcover my fears. Every ſtep I went forward, I believed haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened my misfortune; but I could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</p>
                  <p>Having recourſe to deception, I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely turned my ancle, pretending the ſeverity of pain prevented my walking, and ſetting down by the ſide of a fence, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buckled my ſhoe, and feigned great diſtreſs. In this ſituation I remained near half an hour, when the diſtant ſound of a carriage, encouraged the hope of relief. On com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oppoſite to me, it ſtopped, and my gallant was called by a whiſtle. The cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of my fate, occaſioned an agitation which almoſt deprived me of ſenſes. I ſcreamed as they raiſed me up to hurry me into the coach. At this inſtant Mr. Lee arrived to my deliverance. The villains precipitately retreated. I called for Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretia.
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:025584_0119_0FCE04897380E7F0"/>
Convey me to my friend, ſaid I. Mr. Lee endeavoured to compoſe me, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring me I was ſafe; and that Mrs. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, upon miſſing me, had ſtopped at the houſe of a doctor May, where ſhe remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed waiting for me. My impatience to meet her, hurried me beyond my ſtrength, and when I reached the doctor's, I was for a conſiderable time ſenſeleſs, one fainting fit rapidly ſucceeding another. The applications of my friends finally compoſed my ſpirits, and recovering, I found Lucretia ſitting at my ſide, ſupporting my head up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her ſhoulder. "I have been an equal ſharer with you, my dear," ſaid ſhe, "What have I not anticipated! Language is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adequate to the feelings of my heart; but Caroline is again reſtored."</p>
                  <p>The doctor and Mr. Lee, paid us every poſſible attention. They urged us to tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry till morning; but we inſiſting upon going home, they procured a carriage and accompanied us. When we reached the door of Mrs. Wilkins, the clock ſtruck one; the girl who came to the door appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alarmed. Diſtreſſed with our adventure, and alive to apprehenſions, we could not
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:025584_0120_0FCE048BA90DDB70"/>
ſupport the idea of being left without a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector; and having no man in the houſe, ſolicited Mr. Lee to take a bed. The doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor took his leave, promiſing to call upon us the next day. This incident deprived us of ſleep. My heart was filled with grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, for my repeated eſcapes; and the tear of ſenſibility, which moiſtened the cheek of Lucretia, gave me new proof of her friendſhip.</p>
                  <p>In the morning, agreeably to promiſe, Doctor May called upon us. You can better judge, than I expreſs, my aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when upon his entering the room, I diſcovered the countenance of a man, whoſe character has been the moſt aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned. I recoiled at the remembrance of his vices. Theſe were ſtrongly impreſſed upon my mind, from his having been too ſucceſsful in the ruin of a particular friend in Philadelphia. To elude the reſentment of her friends he abſconded; and changing his name, putting on a wig, and wearing a large patch over one eve, practiced phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic, as I afterwards found, in this place. But at this moment it was neceſſary to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand my feelings. His viſit was painful;
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:025584_0121_0FCE048D69483108"/>
I reſolved, however, not haſtily to expoſe his character; but to inform myſelf if he was reſpected at Havre-de-Grace, hoping he had become a good member of ſociety. Upon queſtioning Fanny, I found he was yet thought a very great libertine, and ſhunned by the virtuous of the fair ſex. I now believed it my duty to caution Mrs. Wilkins, and urged her giving orders to the ſervant, ſhould he call again, to tell him we were out.</p>
                  <p>The ſtory now circulated abroad; and our friends, adviſed to advertiſing a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for the diſcovery of the villains; but expecting Mr. Wilkins in a few days, we concluded to wait his return, and govern ourſelves by his advice. I cannot recal my preſervation to mind, without bedew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the altar of gratitude with tears; and my heart continually expands in ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to heaven. May the watchful eye of Providence, ſtill preſerve me, and render futile the plans of the enraged Eliza.</p>

                  <p>MY ſituation is truly diſtreſſing. A favourite child of wretchedneſs, with the additional affliction of having involved my dear, my loved Lucretia. How ſhall I ſupport the painful idea, or be ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compoſed to recite the unhappy ſtory. The balm prepared by the lenient hand of friendſhip, is inadequate to the deſign; and even virtue's angel form, cannot ſhield me from poignant ſufferings. To be the cauſe of rendering Lucretia unhappy, is a reflection I cannot ſuſtain. The return of Mr. Wilkins, which in anticipation afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuperiour pleaſure, like all the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of human life was ſoon allayed. A momentary gratification was ſucceeded by a diſtreſs, which enfeebles deſcription. The ſatisfaction which beamed from our countenances upon his firſt arrival, was ſoon diſpelled by penſive care, and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by gloomy anxiety. His inquiries af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our health in his abſence, naturally led
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:025584_0123_0FCE04901BF43060"/>
us to relate the incident, which had inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted our pleaſures. No ſooner was he acquainted with the circumſtances, than an alarming change of countenance cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his brow. The ſmile of tranquillity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired; an unuſual auſterity governed every feature of his face. Whence this tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proceeded, I was at a loſs to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. Thinking him fatigued, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps unſucceſsful in buſineſs, I retired early to bed, hoping in the morning to find him in better ſpirits. The next day the ſame unpleaſant look, increaſed my apprehenſions. At breakfaſt, he was ſilent. I obſerved Lucretia frequently caſt her eyes upon him, which inſtantly gliſtened with tears. My heart caught the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; but knowing his unpleaſant temper, I concluded ſome trivial circumſtance had ſoured his mind, and having made it a rule not to notice his reſentments, I aſked no queſtions. As ſoon as breakfaſt was over he took his hat and walked out. Mrs. Wilkins appearing uncommonly depreſſed, I requeſted ſhe would relieve my mind by evolving the cauſe of her anxiety. At this requeſt ſhe burſt into a flood of tears,

which for ſome minutes prevented a reply. At length having overcome, in a degree, the pang of unutterable wretchedneſs, by an exertion, ſhe replied, "Jealouſy, that bane to domeſtic pleaſure, has taken poſt at every avenue of Mr. Wilkins's heart. Our innocent but unfortunate viſit to Mrs. Drayton, has caſt a veil over preſent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, and unleſs ſoon removed, may terminate in moſt deſtructive conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. I have uſed every argument in my power, to calm his mind; but theſe are devoid of efficacy, while the eye of reaſon is blinded by paſſion. The relation you gave him of your eſcape, he ſays, is a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborating proof of guilt. To be indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſuch characters as Doctor May, and Mr. Lee, is at once to be criminal. Nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was confidence in a wife ſo betrayed; never a woman ſo deceitful. To be at the houſe of ſo diſſolute a character, and gallanted by ſuch debauched rakes, and from a feigned fear, detaining one to paſs the night, evinces a guilt which can never be pardoned. The ſtory reſpecting Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line is premeditated; he will not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. Little did he think, the letter he
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:025584_0125_0FCE0494A7D23E90"/>
received at Baltimore had ſuch good foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation." The letter! I exclaimed. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret that your pleaſures ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by any plans againſt me. Had I known this circumſtance, previous to Mr. Wilkins's going out, he ſhould not have left us, until, if poſſible, I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from his mind, ideas ſo deſtructive to your peace; be aſſured I ſhall exert myſelf to ſooth his preſent ſuſpicions.</p>
                  <p>With the moſt ſolicitous impatience, we waited his return to dinner. An hour after his uſual time had elapſed, we ſent to the ſtore. Mr. Wilkins was not to be found. The day was tedious; Lucretia and myſelf were penſile, between hope and fear. We doubted not, however, that evening would reſtore him to our wiſhes. In this we were alike deceived. Diſtant from friends in whoſe advice we could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide, we knew not what ſteps to adopt. I could not prevail upon Mrs. Wilkins to go to bed. A contrariety of ſenſations employed our minds; and a train of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent misfortunes, preſented to view. Every approaching ſtep flattered a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary hope. Thoſe alone who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted

with ſimilar ſorrows, could in any degree realize our diſtreſs. In this truly wretched ſituation, we paſſed ſeveral days.</p>
                  <p>Lucretia, though poſſeſſing a ſingular benevolence and ſweetneſs of mind, was little ſhort of diſtracted. We could get no information of Mr. Wilkins. A week having elapſed in fruitleſs inquiries, I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed her to addreſs her papa, acquainting him with the unhappy event; but her agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was too great; ſhe could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe herſelf, and requeſted I would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the painful taſk. I accordingly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded him a circumſtantial account. Never did I ſo eſſentially experience the want of your preſence, as at this moment. The thick clouds of adverſity ſuſpend every ray of pleaſure, but that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults from an approving conſcience, and the alleviating ſociety of Fanny.</p>
                  <p>It would be impoſſible to ſupport my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, deprived of Maria, under my preſent afflictions, if I was not bleſt with this dear girl. Dejection is ſtrongly depictured upon the countenance of Lucretia, and her mind is wandering; grief preys upon her.</p>

                  <p>OH! my friend, (for by that ſacred name I will fondly ſalute Maria,) could I take you by the hand and lead you to the chamber of Lucretia, the ſcene would excite your tendereſt pity, and your heart bleed for her diſtreſs.</p>
                  <p>Confined to her bed; her intervals of reaſon tranſient; her countenance wild and ghaſtly. The ſight is too affecting: But ſuch is my friend, and ſuch the object which calls my whole attention. Fanny has been with me ſeveral days, and prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſes not to leave me.</p>
                  <p>I was ſitting one evening upon the bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of Lucretia, wiping the dewy cheek, and endeavouring to arouſe her deſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, when the doctor and his pupil enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the chamber. He inquired her ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and, leaving ſome new preſcriptions, withdrew. As Fanny was in the room, I followed him, wiſhing to know his mind with regard to Mrs. Wilkins, being greatly
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:025584_0129_0FCE049C1C1D76C8"/>
alarmed at his unexpected viſit, as he had been with her in the afternoon. Obſerving my anxiety, the good old gentleman at once aſſured me, "His viſit was not from any apprehenſions of immediate danger; for ſo long as a fever could be retarded, there was great encouragement:" And taking me by the hand, "It was to you my viſit was intended. An accidental diſcovery alarms me for your ſafety. Your recent adventure has been a general ſubject of converſation. Since I was with you, in the courſe of my viſits, entering cautiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the houſe of a patient, who lies extremely ill, I overheard the ſervants intimate, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Mrs. Wilkins has in her ſervice, is not of the ſex her habit denotes, but a man, placed in that capacity, the more effectually to complete your ruin; and that he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed a letter to Mr. Wilkins, while at Baltimore, giving ſuch accounts, as, coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding with your ſtory, excited that jeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſy, which occaſioned him to abſcond. I therefore propoſe, that this young gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, under the pretence of Mrs. Wilkins's danger, tarry with you to night, and in the
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:025584_0130_0FCE049E5D19CC70"/>
morning that you remove to ſome place bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter calculated for your ſafety and happineſs."</p>
                  <p>Caſt into the utmoſt aſtoniſhment by the unexpected intelligence, the little fortitude I had flattered myſelf I poſſeſſed, was long incapable of compoſing my mind; nor could I articulate my thanks for his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. The doctor now promiſed to ſee me early in the morning, and to afford me every poſſible aſſiſtance; and requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. Gilet not to leave the houſe until he came, took his leave. How indefatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is Eliza in reſentment; and by what unexpected events, does the Deity diſcloſe the combinations of the wicked.</p>
                  <p>Fanny, uneaſy at my unuſual abſence from Lucretia, came ſoftly down ſtairs and entered the parlour unperceived by me, as I ſat leaning my arm upon the table, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my handkerchief at my eyes; ſhe came towards me, and graſping my hand, with the warmeſt expreſſion of ſolicitude, "Caroline," ſaid ſhe, "let me ſhare in your affliction; impart your diſtreſs; acquaint me what new circumſtance allays your hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs." I could not ſpeak. Mr. Gilet ſtepping to the door, puſhed it too, and
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:025584_0131_0FCE04A004700838"/>
returning to her, ſaid, "A ſuſpicion oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions the preſent thoughtfulneſs of your friend." "It muſt," replied ſhe, "be a well grounded ſuſpicion, thus to overcome her fortitude." He then related the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                  <p>Duty to the diſtracted Lucretia, called for my reſolution, and I ſtudied to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the exquiſite ſenſations of my breaſt; but my reflections were doubly painful, from the inſupportable idea of being the innocent cauſe of her ſufferings. Fanny prevailed upon me to diſſipate my tears; and reſuming as compoſed a countenance, as I poſſibly could, I returned to Lucretia. The anodyne ſhe had taken having produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſleep, ſhe did not notice our entering the chamber. The night was tedious. The hours ſeemed uncommonly retarded; I was impatient for the return of day; ſleep was a ſtranger, and my heart familiar with ſorrow. Early in the morning, the doctor was with us, and adviſed my ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the partner of Mr. Wilkins; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning to his care, the keys, &amp;c. and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to Mrs. Gardiner's, engaged a room for Lucretia. He then ſent his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:025584_0132_0FCE04A159636B90"/>
to convey us to our old lodgings. We at firſt found it difficult to prevail upon her to get up and be dreſſed; but fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately in her greateſt paroxiſms of dejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I had not loſt my influence; and ſhe finally ſubmitted to my perſuaſions. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing got her in the coach, melancholy ſo veiled her ideas, that ſhe appeared entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inattentive; and when we reached Mrs. Gardner's, ſhe ſuffered us to take her out of the carriage and carry her up ſtairs, without any oppoſition; and from this diſtreſſing ſtate of depreſſion and inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, no exertions can renovate this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy woman. When I take the retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, how ſevere my reflections!

                  <p>IN this my diſtreſſed ſituation, how do I wiſh your much loved ſociety, to beguile my grief. Fanny, poſſeſſed of feelings which render her valuable to the children of misfortune, is unwearied in her endeavours to alleviate my miſery. The ſoft voice of her friendſhip, excites many grateful reflections, in the woe-fraught mind of real ſorrow: She unites with me her attention in reſtoring tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity to the diſtracted breaſt of my dear Lucretia.</p>
                  <p>My ſo ſuddenly quitting the houſe of Mr. Wilkins, prevented the execution of any plans, which the malice of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies had ſuggeſted againſt us. Worlds would not have prevailed upon me, to have remained there, after the information I had received. To think we were calling upon a man! and a man by intereſt an enemy to my peace, I recoil at the idea.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="135" facs="unknown:025584_0134_0FCE04A5A0FC0FB0"/>Since we have been at Mrs. Gardner's, Lucretia has, at intervals, been a little more compoſed. She once aſked me, why I removed her from her own houſe? I replied, to cheer her ſpirits. "You are kind, Caroline," ſaid ſhe, "but that is impoſſible; my ſituation is worſe than death. To ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer innocently is indeed hard." This is the moſt connected converſation I have had with her, ſince the week after the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py event took place.</p>
                  <p>By the next poſt, I expect to hear from New-York. In this period of my afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, fail not to pray for the ſupport of your friend. The ſource of my ſufferings is uncommon; and new plans of deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion yet await me. To ſuffer thus in a ſtate of ſeeming baniſhment, racks my health, and ſhatters my reſolution. But the tears I ſhed are not barbed with guilt. This conſolation enables me to attend my diſtreſſed friend. When I conſider how much our characters, and happineſs, is in the power of thoſe around us, I ſhudder at every ſtep I take. Our ſex, are indeed peculiarly expoſed to the ill-natured re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>marks of a cenſorious world. Poſſeſſing,
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:025584_0135_0FCE04A6C63464E8"/>
in general, great vivacity, we are led into many little errors, which although they cannot be called errors of the heart, too frequently ſhade our virtues; nor will the plea of youth, be ſufficient to ward off the ſtigma of imprudence. When I conſider our critical ſituation, and the many deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate points upon which our reputation is eſtabliſhed, I tremble for the honour of my ſex.</p>
                  <p>My mind has been filled with conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, reſpecting the deception impoſed upon us, by the ſervant Mrs. Wilkins had hired. Is this by the artifice of Eliza? How much ſhould I dread her reſentment! I am indeed alive to fear. Can there, Maria, be a female, ſo devoid of every requiſite, to render her attractive? I heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, to believe there is ſuch a character! Yet what diſagreeable truths, does our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing knowledge of human nature un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold upon us. It is too frequently the caſe, that characters, to a curſory obſerver, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with all the virtues requiſite for ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial happineſs, upon an intimate or cloſe examination, loſe thoſe ſtriking traits, and aſſume a contrary appearance, from
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:025584_0136_0FCE04A8DE0F6F40"/>
the varied ſituations in which they are placed. How oppoſite is the raſh, impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent conduct of Mr. Wilkins, to that calm reflection, that ſeeming fortitude and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which at my firſt acquaintance with him, I believed marked his character. Theſe were only the ſhadow of thoſe vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, the real poſſeſſion of which conſtitutes the happineſs of man. Had Mr. Wilkins nurſed theſe virtues, they would not have abandoned his breaſt, at the firſt throb of jealouſy, nor have ſuffered the baleful breath of ſlander to force him from a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving wife, before he had determined up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a juſt cauſe of impeachment. Jealouſy is a characteriſtic of ignorance. When it becomes an inhabitant of the heart, it turns out reaſon, affection is baniſhed, and every tender ſenſation lies dormant. Yes my dear, even love, that ſun of the domeſtic ſoul, is clouded with the black ſhades of ſuſpicion. If poſſible, I muſt eraſe, the killing recollection of Lucretia's ſufferings. Thanks be to heaven, ſhe is at this moment a little compoſed. I will endeavour to amuſe her.</p>

                  <p>LUCRETIA, my loved Lucretia, is now no more: But an inconſolable parent calls my whole attention. For ſeven nights I never left her chamber. Fanny, myſelf, and the nurſe, alternately watched at her bed-ſide, and the greateſt part of this time, Mr. Barton could not be perſuaded to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Wilkins, never once diſcovered the leaſt recollection of either of us, ſince the day previous to her father's arrival, until a few minutes before her diſſolution. This was an additional affliction. Frequently would Mr. Barton ſeize her hand, and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it to his lips, exclaim, "Give me but one ſweet word of conſolation—how bitter my cup of affliction!"</p>
                  <p>A few hours after the letter Mr. Barton had wrote Mr. Wilkins, was ſent on, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, I found a great alteration had tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en place in Lucretia.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="145" facs="unknown:025584_0144_0FCE04B73048A820"/>It being near the uſual time her phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian attended her, I waited with the utmoſt impatience, nor dared to communicate my fears to her father.</p>
                  <p>The doctor ſoon entered the chamber— I watched his looks, I dreaded the deciſion. But the anxiety of a ſincere attachment, eaſily leads us from one extreme to anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and I flattered myſelf, from an expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he dropt, I had anticipated the worſt. This feeble dawn of hope, was only the pleaſing offspring of the moment, which was ſoon deſtroyed, and gave birth to feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings inexpreſſibly diſtreſſing. Approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bed I had juſt left, to make room for the doctor, I begged him by no means to deceive me, in regard to the ſituation of my friend. "Every proſpect," ſaid he, "of recovery is loſt, and death, that friend to human wretchedneſs, will ſoon ſeal her miſery." At this moment, Mr. Barton en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the chamber, having been in an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining room, to obtain, if poſſible, a little ſleep; theſe diſtreſſing words vibrated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his ears, as he opened the door; he flew to the bed, and ſeizing the cold hand of the expiring Lucretia, declared, "By all the
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:025584_0145_0FCE04B9B8A2C398"/>
agonies which now torture my lovely daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by the poignant ſufferings of a parent's breaſt, I ſwear, never to ſuppreſs my reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, until this arm ſhall ſacrifice the villain who has thus undone me." Then heſitating, he turned to the doctor, "Why," ſaid he, "am I deprived of every hope?" The mournful voice of an afflicted father, at this inſtant raiſed the languid eye of his lovely daughter; and giving him an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive look, "My ſufferings," ſaid ſhe, "are nearly cloſed. Caroline, I entreat you, atteſt my innocence. My father too! are you a witneſs of the ſcene? My loved, my much loved parent, believe your daughter what ſhe ever was; believe her innocent. I have only one wiſh ungratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed." "What is that, my darling child?" ſaid Mr. Barton, "I am all impatience; pray tell your anxious parent?" "To make Mr. Wilkins ſenſible of the purity of my mind, of the rectitude of my actions, to ſeal his reconciliation, with the warm kiſs of forgiveneſs, and quit the world re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned." She was now exhauſted. Her father preſſed her hand to his lips—at the inſtant ſhe expired; liſping in broken ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents,
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:025584_0146_0FCE04BADD3470C0"/>
"Oh my father, your bleſſing, I know, attends me. Let your parental re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards, protect Caroline."</p>
                  <p>At this gloomy criſis, every turbulent emotion of deſpair, diſtracted Mr. Barton's mind. "Inhuman Wilkins," ſaid he, "re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge ſhall be mine. With what pangs have you imbittered my life!" At times he ſtood motionleſs, with eyes rivetted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the breathleſs body. The doctor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to prevail upon him, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw. "And will you," ſaid he, "tear me from all I hold dear? She is my child, my only child; you ſhall not take me from her."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Barton remained in the chamber near three hours. Finding him unwilling to leave it, I attempted to retire. "And will you quit a diſtreſſed parent?" ſaid he, "Remember you are my adopted daughter. Lucretia bade me love you." Earneſtly as I wiſhed to withdraw, and much as I need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the conſoling language of friendſhip to aſſuage my ſufferings, my duty compelled me to afford every attention, to the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolable Mr. Barton. But all I urged, yielded him no relief.</p>

The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion I have in it, adds to my wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But while deſtined to ſorrow, may lenient reſignation with the luſtre of a noonday ſun, dawn upon my mind her peaceful radiance, and diſſipate repining thoughts.</p>

                  <p>SUCH an ebon ſhade obſcures my happineſs, and ſo great is the vacuum in my heart, that I am at a loſs how to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs my dear Maria. To part with our friends, how ſevere the taſk! Language how feeble, when uſed to expreſs acute ſenſations! But you need not the repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my exigencies to attune your breaſt to pity. The dew of friendſhip frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moiſtens your cheek, on the recollection of my ſufferings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I thank you for this pleaſing characteriſtic of humanity; let it not inſenſibly deprive you of your pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures.</p>
                  <p>It is impoſſible to calm Mr. Barton. Bereft of Lucretia—deprived of his all, he refuſes to be comforted. Having never experienced the meliorating influence of that religion, which exhilarates the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, and enables him to ſuſtain afflictions; he is without that comfort, which can only be derived from its bleſſed truths.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="150" facs="unknown:025584_0149_0FCE04C01C2F0AC8"/>Mr. Wilkins's arrival, I anticipate with the moſt lively diſtreſs. The ſtyle in which Mr. Barton addreſſed him, was not conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to my feelings. Human nature is more frequently brought to a ſenſe of its errors, by the mild voice of perſuaſion, than the harſh language of reſentment. I fear Mr. Barton will never be ſufficiently compoſed, to treat him with propriety. I cannot prevail upon him to eat, or ſleep. His conſtant cry is, "Bring me that mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Wilkins; that ſcandal to humanity." I dread each diſtant ſtep, leaſt it ſhould prove the meſſenger of his arrival. Twice, ſince yeſterday, he has locked himſelf in the chamber of Lucretia; and for more than an hour refuſed me admittance. My whole attention is confined to him.</p>
                  <p>The brow of your friend, long contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſorrow, is now marked with inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible dejection. Since I wrote you yeſterday, ſuch additional diſtreſſes have enveloped me, as even the warm imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Maria, cannot paint.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt time ſince Lucretia's death, I had prevailed upon Mr. Barton, to throw
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:025584_0150_0FCE04C31EA7C740"/>
himſelf upon the bed, in hopes a little ſleep would better enable him to pay the laſt reſpects to the memory of his unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate daughter, who was in the afternoon to be entombed. A melancholy ſtillneſs, encouraged my gloemy reflections. I was feeding upon the remembrance of Lucre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia's ſufferings, when a ſudden noiſe arouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me from my reverie. My foreboding heart, inſtantly ſuggeſted the fatal truth. So great was my agitation, it deprived me of my ſtrength. I had not power to riſe from my ſeat. In a few minutes, I heard the voice of Mr. Wilkins upon the ſtairs. "Inſupportable is my ſituation!" ſaid he, "Arrived too late? Lucretia gone!" At the ſound of this much loved name, Mr. Barton ſtarted from the bed, and flying to the door, uttered, as he went out, "Vengeance ſhall be mine!" I faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. When I came to myſelf, I was on the bed; Fanny was bathing my temples; Mrs. Gardner and the girls were in the room; I inquired for Mr. Barton; they replied, he was in the next chamber; I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted, he might be called; they evaded a compliance. Suſpicious of new diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:025584_0151_0FCE04C4FB4CB5B8"/>
I aroſe, and going towards the door, was prevented, by Fanny, from opening it. "Stop, my dear," ſaid ſhe, "Mr. Barton will be with you in a few minutes." I will not be detained, ſaid I, and preſſing by her, hurried down ſtairs; and entering the parlour, found Mr. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton reclining in an arm chair. He took no notice of me. Going up to him, and ſeizing his hand, I entreat you, ſaid I, to let me know the worſt. Where is Mr. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins? This name arouſed him. "The villain, the monſter," replied he, "who, in a fit of jealouſy, murdered my only child, is now, I hope, no more. Think not an injured parent could forgive his cruelty. When I heard his voice, I ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the piſtol, previouſly loaded and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed in my boſom; and as he was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the chamber, which contains the ſacred remains of my departed angel, I ſhot him through the head; and locking the door, ordered the hated object from my ſight" The tears of affliction, now mingled with thoſe of fear, rolling plentifully from my eyes, deprived me of expreſſion. Mrs. Gardner coming into the room, I left her
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:025584_0152_0FCE04C6190F4880"/>
with Mr. Barton; and going unexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Fanny, found her abſorbed in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. My dear, ſaid I, Mr. Barton tells me he has ſhot Mr. Wilkins through the head. Is he really dead? "No," replied ſhe, "the ball having entered his right ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is thought to have taken a very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous direction; but he yet lives." Is he ſenſible? ſaid I. I will haſten to him; let a ſervant be diſpatched to know. Scarce had I done ſpeaking, before Mrs. Gardner called us. We haſtened to her. Mr. Barton was in a fit. With great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty they got him up ſtairs. The doctor was ſent for. The fits rapidly increaſed and I was prevented from attending the funeral of Lucretia. Judge my feelings, when the ſolemn knell vibrated upon my ears, which hurried from my view, forev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the ſincere friend of my youth, at the moment her affectionate father was groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſevere pain. Anxious to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince Mr. Wilkins of the innocence of his wife, I was impatient to be with him, that I might improve the firſt interval of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but duty detained me with Mr. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. I am deprived of every pleaſing

proſpect.

                  <p>Mr. Barton's fits have ſubſided —they have left him extremely weak—he ſays but little—when he ſpeaks, it is of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretia. I ſent this morning to inquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Mr. Wilkins—the ſervant brought word, he was ſenſeleſs. Jealouſy, thou bane to human happineſs, thou deſtroyer of all my pleaſures! How haſt thou ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted every fancied gratification! Had it not been for this fatal paſſion, Eliza would not have purſued me with her reſentment, nor Lucretia and Mr. Wilkins been thus wretched.</p>
                  <p>Fanny tells me it is generally believed, the ſervant Mrs. Wilkins had in her houſe, was a man who had formerly lived with Eliza's parents; I ſuſpect the letter Mr. Wilkins received at Baltimore, was from him. That it was a man we had engaged in our ſervice, ſeveral circumſtances tend to prove; but none more, than his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate flight. Many ſtories circulating in
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:025584_0155_0FCE04CB70470240"/>
this place detrimental to our characters, upon being traced, we find originated with him; yet, falſe as they are, it will be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to remove prejudices. There are ſome ideas, which, if once entertained of a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, are ever after believed. This ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation is too generally true, as it regards female reputation. A ſtriking trait of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man depravity! But a chain of unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate events has haſtened our ruin. Our viſit to Mrs. Drayton has been attended with extreme diſtreſs. Repeating the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate ſtory to Mr. Wilkins, from its being connected with thoſe looſe characters to whom we were indebted, gave us an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of guilt. Let us deduce a moral from the misfortune, and from hence learn, not raſhly to condemn; for although ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances may beſpeak guilt, full confidence is not always to be placed upon them. Appearances can ſeldom be the ſtandard of determining the truth, while deception conceals the motives from which we act. I am called to Mr. Barton.</p>

                  <p>This morning I was ſuddenly awakened by the nurſe at my bed-ſide. For heaven's ſake, ſaid I, what now awaits me—is Mr. Barton worſe? "Mr. Barton, Madam," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied ſhe, "is dead." Shocked at this ſudden information, I ſprang out of bed, and ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping on my clothes, ran into his chamber; the nurſe followed. "I went to him," ſaid ſhe, "to inquire if he wiſhed for any thing to take; he appearing to be aſleep, and eaſier than I had before obſerved him, I

put my ear, near his mouth, and after liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening ſome minutes, could not perceive that he drew his breath; alarmed at this, I laid my hand upon his forehead, which inſtantly convinced me he was dead." Pray nurſe, ſaid I, call Mrs. Gardner; and flinging myſelf into a chair, received a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary relief from a friendly flood of tears. The family were ſoon with me. Unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of my ſituation, I ſtill ſat weeping, even after all the boarders had aſſembled in the room. In the moments of keen afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, etiquette and propriety are frequently forgot. Mrs. Gardner and the girls were alſo ſurpriſed, they were as inattentive as myſelf; in ſhort, the moſt painful confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion prevailed, when two young gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who had, I believe, juſt entered the chamber, came to me, and entreated me to retire; remaining with the object, they ſaid, would only irritate my feelings, and aſſuring me they would pay every poſſible attention to my friend, directed the nurſe to aſſiſt me in returning to my chamber, and by a hint to the other gentleman, got them down ſtairs, that I might have an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to paſs. When I entered my
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:025584_0159_0FCE04D457AE06E8"/>
room, I threw myſelf upon the bed, and gave freſh vent to my tears. In a few min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utes Fanny came into my chamber, with a bowl of tea, which ſhe urged me to drink.</p>
                  <p>Capt. Clark and Capt. Green, ſhe ſaid, had ſent for the doctor, and begged I would command their ſervices. After complying with her requeſt, ſhe aſſiſted me in dreſſing. The doctor now arrived, and I found, by Mrs. Gardner, had pronounced Mr. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's death occaſioned by poiſon. Upon examining the body, it was extremely ſwelled; and their moving it, ſoon made him an object unfit for ſight. The doctor thinking he might burſt in a few hours, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed to his being immediately put into the coffin.</p>
                  <p>At this dreadful criſis, my reaſon ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed dormant. I was incapable of doing my duty; and had it not been for thoſe young gentlemen to whom I am peculiarly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted, though entirely unknown, I ſhould have been ignorant of every ſtep neceſſary for me to purſue upon the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and ſtill more deeply involved Mr. Barton's character in diſgrace, by adding ſuicide to murder. It had been given out
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:025584_0160_0FCE04D51AB2A7E0"/>
by the family, that Mr. Barton had made his eſcape immediately upon firing at Mr. Wilkins; and this report concealed him from the hands of juſtice. The circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of his death, it was likewiſe neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſecrete. His having been danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ill, favoured the idea of a natural diſſolution. After they had removed him into his coffin, a bottle of arſenic was found under his pillow, which confirmed the ſuſpicion. Fanny, like a guardian an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, never leaves me. Capt. Clark, ſhe ſays, ordered every thing belonging to Mr. Barton, to be locked up, and has taken care of the keys, until I ſhall be able to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to them. He begs me to conſider him as a brother, and aſſures me his heart is alive to my diſtreſs. How does the Deity raiſe up new friends, when he deprives us of the ſupport of thoſe with which we had been favoured!</p>
                  <p>Capt. Clark, although a ſtranger to me, evinces ſo much ſincerity, that I can do no leſs than accept his friendly offers. Perhaps you may think me ignorant of the deception of the human heart; but I have ſuffered too ſeverely, not to have learnt a
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:025584_0161_0FCE04D69C48B130"/>
leſſon from ſuch repeated afflictions. I ſhall relinquiſh the direction of every thing to him. The family have been very attentive to me; Fanny I ſhall ever love. They unite in urging me to join them below. I am ſenſible indulgence of grief deſtroys the health; but have been ſo confined to a ſick chamber ſince I have been here, that I am a ſtranger to all the boarders; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, however, refuſe, without giving them offence.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Wilkins has lain ſeveral days, in ſuch a ſituation; every hour has been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected would be his laſt. Could one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval of reaſon be allowed him, eagerly would I haſten to his gloomy chamber, and acquaint him with the laſt fond expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of my dear Lucretia. This would eaſe the pang of diſſolving nature. My narration is ſo painful, I am at times diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ceaſe the recital.</p>

                  <p>THE diſtance which ſeparates me from Maria, and my connexions, has been an additional affliction to me. Yet this misfortune has been greatly alleviated by the lenient balm of Fanny's friendſhip, and the brotherly attention and tenderneſs of Capt. Clark, who has taken every pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful taſk from my hands. My heart is fraught with gratitude to heaven for ſuch peculiar bleſſings. Mr. Barton was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately buried by the ſide of his daughter, the evening ſucceeding his death.</p>
                  <p>What an affecting ſtory, is that of Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line! and how much is a jealous temper to be avoided!

                  <p>From Mr. Wilkins's continuing for ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral days beyond the expectations of his phyſicians, I cannot but flatter myſelf he may yet recover. Nothing ſhould have prevented my attendance upon him, ſince Mr. Barton's death, but my own ill health. The bloom which once decorated my cheek has fled, and the eye of your friend, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for vivacity, now beſpeaks her grief. How vain and illuſory are our gratifications in life. Mr. Wilkins has not been bleſt with one interval of reaſon, ſince the unhappy event; and as I can render him no eſſential ſervice, Capt.

                  <p>LAST night, the unhappy Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins expired! Haſtened into eternity without a thought ſuitable for the ſolemn event! How unprepared muſt he be, to meet that Judge, at whoſe tribunal he now appears! I have urged Capt.

                  <p>SO long have I been accuſtomed to hope and fear, it is difficult to diveſt myſelf of anxiety and care. I ſtill feel, as if ſome object demanded my particular attention. I walk to the chamber of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretia, and enter the door, before I recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect ſhe is gone, beyond the reach of my friendſhip. Diſpoſed to indulge my mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancholy ſenſations, I retire to my own apartment; but the aſſiduity of Fa<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> ever prevents me from gratifying a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition ſo injurious to my health. She, in a language dictated by an exalted friendſhip, prevails upon me to join the family below, who unitedly exert themſelves to diſpel my gloom. Thoſe two gentlemen I have previouſly mentioned, appear deſirous to amuſe me: They are, I find, officers in the ſecond United States regiment, and profeſs a ſtrong friendſhip for each other. Capt. Clark requeſts me to view his friend,
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:025584_0167_0FCE04E1DDF8AF08"/>
"As my friend and brother. He has, Madam," continued he, "taſted of the cup of misfortune; but his mind is ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to every diſhonourable idea, and you will ever find him ready to adviſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect your character and happineſs.</p>
                  <p>This naturally led me to make ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries reſpecting him. "I am gratified," ſaid, Captain Clark, "at your inclination, to become acquainted with his hiſtory. His parents reſide at Halifax, and are people of intereſt and character. At the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the conteſt, between Great Britain and America, a ſpirit of liberty thrilled in his breaſt: He viewed the meaſures purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the Colonies, as tending to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of their privileges; and relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhing every fond attachment, quitted his native country, that he might raiſe his war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like arm, in defence of injured freedom; and taking paſſage for Nantucket, from thence he proceeded, by land, to the army, then ſtationed near Boſton. His ſtory gained him the confidence of the general officers, and he ſhortly received a commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the army, where he ſerved to uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal ſatisfaction, till the cloſe of the war.
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:025584_0168_0FCE04E4DE971DA0"/>
By his conduct, he gained the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his ſuperior officers, and the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form character of a brave man. His ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting himſelf from the government under which he lived, and accepting a commiſſion from the Americans, enraged his connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, and they totally diſcarded him. Thrown out of all employment, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of every expectation from his friends, he was left, at the cloſe of the war, with many of his brother officers, deſtinate of a ſupport; and has neceſſarily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced great difficulties. The ſacrifices he made in behalf of theſe States at firſt procured him a commiſſion; and his inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable bravery and coolneſs, now call him from private life, again to encounter the dangers of the field; and we are mutually engaged in enliſting troops for the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward."</p>
                  <p>This little hiſtory excited my particular attention. I began to be intereſted in his future fortune; for I freely acknowledge I was not ſo much pleaſed with his perſon or addreſs, as I was with Captain Clark. Certain prepoſſeſſions ever attend a firſt interview, and we frequently ſuffer our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:025584_0169_0FCE04E6C2E374C8"/>
to be prejudiced only from appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Such determinations are, however, inconſiſtent with our better judgment. Many virtues lie concealed from curſory obſervation, which, on intimacy, pleaſingly expand to view. Beſides, there are a thouſand little incidents which tend to bias the mind, and the female is ſoon partial to the attention of a pleaſing character.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall remain in this place but a week or two longer. On my return to Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, I flatter myſelf to hear more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently from Maria.</p>

                  <p>"A FRIEND," ſays Seneca, "may be taken away, but not the ſweets of their friendſhip. As there is a ſharpneſs in ſome fruits, and a bitterneſs in ſome wines which pleaſe; ſo there is a mixture in the remembrance of friends, where the loſs of their company, is ſweetened by the contemplation of their virtues." How pleaſingly will this apply to Lucretia. The friendly hand of time, meliorates our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions; it teaches us to view the painful ſeparation of our friends, as the conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of their happineſs. Through this medium, we become reconciled; and while we mourn the loſs we have ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we rejoice, that the object of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is beyond the reach of anxiety and care. Their little foibles are obliterated from memory, or if we recal them to mind,

ſenſible that human nature cannot attain perfection, we draw over them the veil of candour, and dwell only upon their virtues.</p>
                  <p>Scarce one night do I retire to reſt, but my dreaming fancy preſents my loved Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretia. Frequently am I engaged with her in thoſe amuſements which once delighted her. In theſe pleaſing deliriums, I forget ſhe is an inhabitant of heaven, and converſe with her as a mortal being. Nor does any circumſtance tend more to demonſtrate the immortality of the mind, than the excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions it frequently makes, while the body, to which it is annexed, lies in a ſtate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility. If we have a juſt eſtimation of the amazing powers with which the Deity has endowed the mind, we ſhall be loſt in admiration, and with Doctor Young, exclaim—</p>

                  <p>A FEW days ſince, I gave you a little hiſtory of my friend, Captain Green, and I make no doubt, but the heart of Maria, which is uniformly intereſted for the ſons of affliction, experienced a pang, ſimilar with my own.</p>
                  <p>If I was pleaſed with the attention of Captain Clark, at the moment of intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, I am now doubly attached to him. With the moſt brotherly affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he anticipates my wiſhes, and aims to ward off every painful circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; he has devoted himſelf to my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and diſcharged all the bills occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Mr. Barton's and Lucretia's ſickneſs. He propoſes Captain Green ſhall take the charge of the few men, they have enliſted here, that he may accompany me in the ſtage to Philadelphia.</p>

                     <pb n="175" facs="unknown:025584_0174_0FCE04EFA767FB70"/>Looking over the pocket book of Mr. Barton, I ſaw a letter directed to me, which, upon opening, I found contained a will, by the date diſcovered to have been written the day after Lucretia's death; in which, after bequeathing me a thouſand pounds, he divides the reſidue of his eſtate between his only ſiſter, a widow in the State of New-York, and her children; leaving the clothes he had with him, his watch, &amp;c. &amp;c. at my diſpoſal. "In my pocket book," adds the will, "are bank bills to the amount of five hundred dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, which will be more than ſufficient to defray the expenſes attendant upon Lucre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia's, and my misfortunes; and whatever remains, I requeſt Mrs. Gardner to accept."</p>
                  <p>He has appointed two particular friends in New-York, his executors. I gave the will into the hands of Captain Clark; who, after having it proved and regiſtered here, encloſed and forwarded it, by the poſt, to New-York. The trunk contained only a few clothes; but being a very ſuitable one for travelling, I wiſhed to preſent it to the Captain; yet heſitated at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety

of the action; but obſerving he appeared much pleaſed with it, I handed him the key, begging he would oblige me, by calling that, and the contents, his own. He received this token of my friendſhip, with a grace peculiar to himſelf. There is an eaſe in the moſt trivial actions of his life, which diſcovers his education. But even the ſociety of Captain Clark and his friend, with the addition of my dear Fanny, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eraſe from my mind thoſe hours which are paſſed. No, Maria; retroſpection car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries me back to thoſe happy days, when I ſipped pleaſure from the converſation of Lucretia. May heaven bleſs you.</p>

Yeſterday morning miſſing her from breakfaſt, I inquired of her mamma the reaſon: She informed me, her health had been very indifferent for ſome time; and that laſt night ſhe had experienced an ill turn. As ſoon as I had breakfaſted, I left the table, and going ſoftly up ſtairs, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly opened the chamber door, and found her awake. Having made a few inquiries, I told her my apprehenſions, and begged to know if any new circumſtance had taken place to interrupt her happineſs. If there has, ſaid I, you muſt not keep me ignorant. "How benetrating is the eve of Caroline,"

replied ſhe, "that I cannot conceal the ſecret ſentiments of my heart. It is the neceſſities of Frederick, which render me thus wretched. Deprived of a handſome property by the caſualties of trade, he finds it impoſſible to ſupport a helpleſs family, without becoming more deeply involved in difficulties.</p>

He inſiſted that he ſhould pay him a great part of what he had received, or he would immediately at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach his furniture for the debt, and Fred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erick was obliged to ſubmit.</p>
                  <p>Humanity, that emblem of an exalted mind, how foreign from a heart character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized by the moſt ſordid avarice! His ſtoic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al indifference to a ſuffering brother, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitates my health; my pleaſures ſicken, and my eyes are filled with the briny dew of ſorrow."</p>

If we abound in riches, we are placed above an experimental knowledge of thoſe neceſſities which are inſeparable to a ſtate of poverty, and too often become inattentive obſervers of human miſery. Riches have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taminating influence; they frequently pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify the fineſt feelings of the heart. It is not, my dear, in your power to change the diſpoſition of Charles, nor muſt you ſuffer it to make you wretched. It is ſometimes our duty to conquer our moſt exquiſite feelings. Obtain from your brother the ſum neceſſary for preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and if within my abilities, it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to my happineſs, to leſſen his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction. Saying this, I left the chamber. How unequal are the diſtributions of Providence! Some abound, while others want the daily ſupports of life. Give, moſt merciful Father, to the fortunate, feeling hearts, and may they aim to leſſen human ſufferings.</p>

                  <p>WHEN I gave you a little hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of Captain Green, I was totally unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with that of Captain Clark, but have ſince found, from his friend, he is a native of Boſton, where his connexions now reſide; from what I can learn, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him to be a deſerving, experienced officer. The life of a ſoldier, his neceſſities have compelled him to adopt. I am ever cautious in my expreſſions reſpecting new friends, but the general behaviour of this gentleman, evinces a ſuperiority of mind, which cannot fail to pleaſe. Be not jeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that my affections are diminiſhed for Captain Evremont, when I declare I am pleaſed with the attentions of Captain Clark, and the friendſhip he expreſſes for me. I acknowledge to feel for him, a ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly affection. He is well acquainted
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:025584_0180_0FCE04FB6542DD38"/>
with my engagements, and ſpeaks of Captain Evremont in exalted terms. He ſerved in the ſame regiment with him, the laſt war, and ſays, "He ever found him, a good ſoldier, and a valuable <hi>friend.</hi>" A valuable <hi>friend!</hi> How much is implied, in this ſhort, but comprehenſive ſentence! It vibrates pleaſingly upon my heart. It re-echoes harmony to my ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Gardner has conſented that Fanny ſhall accompany me to Philadelphia. I cannot think of parting with her; and her ill health favours my requeſt.</p>
                  <p>For ſeveral days paſt, I have been fineſſed into a temporary happineſs, by the aſſiduity of my friends. I feel my obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations for this momentary forgetfulneſs of trouble. Their ſeaſonably engaging my mind in converſation, was better cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to relieve my diſtreſs, than any diverſion I could have purſued. It is an indulgence in which I delight. It does not confine us to any particular theme; hence it can never cloy. By affording that variety conſonant to the human mind, it long retains its powers of amuſement.</p>

                  <p>WHEN I laſt addreſſed you, I flattered myſelf my next letter would be dated from Philadelphia, as Captain Green had conſented to take the charge of Captain Clark's men. But I am yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this city by an unfortunate acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, in which my friend, the Captain, is particularly concerned.</p>
                  <p>A few days after his arrival at Havre-de-Grace, as he was ſtanding at the door of the coffee-houſe, a Mr. Peters went up to him, and ſaid, "Was my brother, who ſerved upon Rhode-Iſland, arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for cowardice in that expedition?" Captain Clark, with an air of indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, replied, "Juſt as you ſay, Sir."</p>
                  <p>Nothing farther paſſed between them, until the night previous to our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended departure for Philadelphia; when
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:025584_0183_0FCE0500F32FA340"/>
Mrs. Gardner, alarmed by a knocking at the ſtreet door, jumped out of bed, and puſhing up the window, requeſted to know who was there. A perſon now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for Captain Clark, adding, "He muſt ſee him immediately. She obſerved, "The Captain intended ſetting off very early in the morning for Philadelphia, and ſhe could not think of calling him at ſo late an hour—pray Sir, pleaſe to leave your name, I will not omit to tell him you cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led." "Madam," ſaid he, "be ſo oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as to ſtep to his door, and tell him Captain Peters is in waiting and muſt ſee him, as an event of the utmoſt importance has taken place at the coffee-houſe, and his advice is wanted, to ſettle an unhappy affair." Mrs. Gardner appearing to heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, he continued, "<hi>I give you my honour, Madam, that no injury is intended him.</hi>" Finding ſhe could not put him off, ſhe delivered the meſſage to Captain Clark, who, ever ready to aſſiſt all who were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in difficulty, aroſe, and putting on his clothes, hurried down ſtairs, and opening the ſtreet door, found <hi>Captain Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and his brother,</hi> who apologized for call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:025584_0184_0FCE05021C6EA020"/>
him out of bed, by obſerving, that a number of gentlemen, engaged in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute at the coffee-houſe, had agreed to leave it with him to ſettle. And taking him under each arm, they walked on, till they reached the ſpot, intended for their puſilanimous plan, when Captain Peters thus addreſſed him: "Did you, Sir, aſſert that I was arreſted upon Rhode-Iſland for cowardice?" "No," he replied, "I did not." "It is a lie, Sir," ſaid Captain Peters, and inſtantly gave him a ſevere ſtroke with his cane, which brought him to the ground; when, like cowards, <hi>they both</hi> beat him until he was ſenſeleſs, and then left him. In this ſituation, he remained all night. In the morning he was taken up, and carried into a houſe in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. A phyſician was called, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately was the one that attended Mr. Barton; and having waſhed and dreſſed the wounds, recollected the countenance of my friend. He accordingly diſpatched a perſon to Mrs. Gardner to acquaint her with the accident. As ſoon as ſhe received this information, ſhe came into my cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to inform me of the cauſe of our

delay, and added, "There was nothing to fear from the wounds, no bones being broken." Diſtreſſed by this circumſtance, I haſtened down ſtairs, and diſpatched a ſervant to the doctor, requeſting to ſee him. He ſoon came, and begged me to entertain no fears in behalf of my friend, aſſuring me he was greatly recovered ſince the dreſſing of his wounds, and he flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf would, in a few days, be able to purſue his journey.

                  <p>ALTHOUGH we had abſolutely engaged ſeats in the ſtage, and Captain Green had taken leave of us the day before, it was impoſſible for us to commence our journey. This diſappointment was trifling, compared with the anxiety I experienced for my friend.</p>
                  <p>About noon, Captain Clark ſtopped at the door in a carriage. I ran to meet him. Upon obſerving me, he aſſumed an air of gaiety, which, it was eaſy to perceive, was foreign from his heart. "I regret," ſaid he, "you are deprived the ſatisfaction of joining your friends, as early as you wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but I flatter myſelf it will delay you only a few days." I ſtrove to ſuppreſs my tears; yet, notwithſtanding every exertion to check my feelings, my tell-tale eyes gliſtened with the tears of pity. "Gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:025584_0187_0FCE050759836AF8"/>
as I am, ſaid he, "with the intereſt you take in the abuſe I have experienced, let me intreat you not to add to my preſent feelings—do not diſtreſs me with your tenderneſs." Hard was the ſtruggle to conceal the ſenſations of my heart; but, reſolving to caſt the mantle of friendſhip over my painful emotions, I feigned a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity I did not enjoy. He then gave the ſtory as I have related it to you.</p>
                  <p>For Captain Peters to pledge his <hi>honour that no injury was intended,</hi> and then to proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute this ſacred pledge, was an unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ignominious deception, far beneath the dignity of a brave and noble mind. To give his ſacred honour, and to abuſe that truſt this confidence inſpires. To at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack an unarmed man, and, with the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of his brother, thus to beat him, leaving him to ſuffer in the ſtreet the whole night, are blots in their characters, which will excite univerſal contempt. I am ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of the iſſue.</p>
                  <p>Captain Clark's diſpoſition will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to ſubmit to treatment thus incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with his honour. But theſe men

                  <p>CAPTAIN Clark is yet confined to the houſe. I exert myſelf to amuſe him; but this is difficult. The gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are early familiarized to buſineſs and amuſement, which call their attention abroad; ſhort confinements are, to them, almoſt inſupportable; and a little ſickneſs, with all their bravery and courage, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently renders them peeviſh and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient; while our ſex, inured to ſcenes more tranquil and retired, are leſs liable to repine at indiſpoſition.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding the ſevere blows my friend has received, his eyes are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of their uſual luſtre. Theſe yet ſpeak, in the moſt expreſſive manner, the manly and noble ſentiments of his ſoul. I wiſh not to preſent him to you, as a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar beauty, or an elegant form.

In his heart are united ſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iments and feelings which dignify the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mind; qualifications, which will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend him to Maria.</p>
                  <p>For ſeveral days I was greatly diſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, leaſt a duel ſhould terminate the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy affair; but yeſterday it was ſettled through the interpoſition of friends.</p>

                  <p>WE ſhould have left this the laſt ſtage, had not Fanny's anxiety for her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate brother yet detained us.</p>
                  <p>Agreeably to my promiſe, the day pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to our intended departure, I preſented her the ſum ſhe had aſſured me was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for his preſent relief. This ſhe went in the evening to give him, when ſhe found the family in the greateſt diſtreſs. His creditors impatient for the diſcharge of their debts, had that day made ſeveral attachments; and as Fanny opened the door to enter the houſe, an officer availed himſelf of the opportunity to execute another writ: This execution deprived them of every neceſſary article. Fanny immediately diſpatched a meſſage to her brother, in hopes, by bringing him to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs his diſtreſſes, he might be induced to
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:025584_0193_0FCE05105A25F458"/>
aſſiſt him; but when he came, he abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely refuſed the moſt trivial relief. She now took Mrs. Gardner aſide, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the bills received from me. Thus being enabled to ſatisfy preſent calls, he ſaved his little remaining furniture, depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of which, his family could not have continued together. Fanny, overcome by this circumſtance, requeſted I would relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh the idea of her accompanying me. To this I could not conſent.</p>
                  <p>Captain Clark has intereſted himſelf in behalf of this child of adverſity; and, in the moſt pathetic language, endeavoured to excite feelings in the breaſt of Charles; but without effect. What a heart muſt he poſſeſs, thus to ſuffer a deſerving brother, deprived of health and property, to want even the neceſſaries of life! Unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man! The Deity may not always ſmile upon your proſperity. Intoxicated with your preſent ſucceſs, you think yourſelf far beyond the reach of fortune's frown; but remember, you may ſink from the pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icle of affluence, from the moſt elevated ſummit of wealth, to the dreary vale of misfortune. And although you are baſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

in the indulgence of all your wiſhes, the ſcene may ſuddenly change, and pov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty, with its concomitant miſeries, await you; you may yet drink in full draughts, the gall of diſappointment, and largely ſhare in ſimilar misfortunes with your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted brother.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Gardner determines, if he can make ſufficient intereſt, to obtain a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion in the army; and to relinquiſh all idea of remaining with his family.</p>
                  <p>This reſolution he reluctantly purſues. His attachment to a family, unable to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for itſelf, renders it painful. Captain Clark has promiſed him his influence; and as Mr. Gardner held a commiſſion in the late army, flatters himſelf he ſhall ſucceed. Whatever the reflections of his brother may be, with reſpect to his unfeeling con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, the time, I doubt not, will arrive, when he will retire to the family of his own thoughts, replete with the moſt poig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſenſations, for having added to the complicated diſtreſs of a deſerving brother.</p>
                  <p>May the journey of our lives, my dear Maria, be rendered pleaſant by the ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine of proſperity; and while we drink

                  <p>Sympathy, my dear, is a pleaſing ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent, implanted in the human breaſt, which induces us, if we cannot mitigate, to become momentarily intereſted in the misfortunes of our friends.</p>

                  <p>Captain Clark has, I find, many friends in this city, who are partial to his merits. This is pleaſing to me. To have our choice in any point, approved by men of ſenſe, is ever a flattering circumſtance, and obliterates from a female mind, every ray of uneaſineſs, leſt her too tender ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptibility, had pourtrayed excellencies, which exiſted no where, but in her par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial imagination. Some of your relations are pleaſed to patronize him: They have united their influence with his, in behalf of Mr. Gardner, and have a proſpect of ſucceſs. I regret the ſad alternative, which obliges him to quit his family for a life ſo averſe to his wiſhes, and which ſome ſmall aſſiſtance from his brother might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. Surely the Deity has traced the outlines of our duty upon our hearts, which a certain inexpreſſible conſciouſneſs points out to us; yet we frequently ſtifle feelings ſo honourary to our natures. Being in haſte, can only add the aſſuranc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of my friendſhip.</p>

                  <p>MRS. Leaſon tells me, ſhe has received a letter from my aunt Noble, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting to be accommodated at her houſe a few weeks, as ſhe wiſhes to make a viſit to Philadelphia: She at firſt heſitated a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; but finding me ſilent, and that her ſtay would be ſhort, ſhe has conſented. Thus I am ſtill to be troubled with the repetition of a ſtory, long ſince hateful. I can bear it with tolerable fortitude in a letter; but to be taken by the hand, and compelled to hear a diſtaſteful tale, deprives me of all my philoſophy. I am half a mind to fly to the arms of my friend, in whoſe ſociety I am confident I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive new gratifications, and whoſe friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip would give me a hearty welcome.</p>
                  <p>Fanny is much pleaſed with this city. It is ſaid to be one of the moſt beautiful

America can boaſt; but perhaps you may think I carry my ideas of variety rather too far, when I ſay, there is a little too much ſameneſs for my taſte. I acknowledge it is uncommon for one, who ſtyles herſelf a citizen, to be impartial; for the place of our birth, generally claims our warmeſt attachment.</p>
                  <p>We made a party, a few days ſince, to the Falls of Schuylkill, to give Fanny an opportunity of ſeeing ſome of the delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſeats. I ſincerely hope, the journey, and attention to her health, will be of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to her. I am impatient to introduce this dear girl to Maria: She is indeed one of thoſe rare plants, ſeldom to be found in the wilderneſs of life. There is an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent expreſſion in her countenance, which cannot, like the fading flower of beauty, be diveſted of its charms.</p>
                  <p>Captain Clark will ſoon leave us. How many incidents occur to deſtroy our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! The ſweet ſenſibility which gives us the true reliſh of our joys, frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes our weight of ſuffering. The grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ification we derive from the ſociety of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genial minds, occaſions the moſt ſevere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret,
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:025584_0201_0FCE051D2990A3E8"/>
when deprived of their valuable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe. It is ſo ſeldom we find thoſe, who are ſuſceptible of real friendſhip, who are incapable of deception, and who unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly poſſeſs the qualifications requiſite for a friend, that ſuch a prize cannot be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently eſtimated. I know it is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon idea of the world, that "Friendſhip with women is ſiſter to love." But while I would pay a due reſpect to their general principles and obſervations, I muſt take the liberty to deviate from them, when their ſentiments are incompatible with my own experience. I already diſcover your concluſion, and that you are claſſing Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line as a Platonic diſciple: It will not, however, denote her character; although I cannot imagine, as much as the world laugh at this philoſopher's ideas of love and friendſhip, why we may not eſteem an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened mind, without feeling for the perſon, that degree of affection which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates a peculiar, undeſcribable attachment. It is indeed ſeldom the caſe, that real men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal abilities are the foundation of a firſt prepoſſeſſion; external beauty, an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed behaviour, or the more captivating

charms of fortune, are too often the illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive meteors which enchant the eye and conſtrain the heart. Think not I intend a general reflection, when I add, the art of ſpeaking trifles agreeably, too often proves a deſtructive poiſon, which terminates the happineſs of female life. Daily obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion demonſtrates the truth. Nor is an agreeable addreſs more likely to deceive our ſex, than thoſe who claim the boaſted ſuperiority of prudence, penetration and wiſdom. We frequently ſee the merchant deceived by his ill placed confidence, and his family involved in complicated wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs. As I have written a long let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I now feel diſpoſed to conclude, —I hear Captain Clark's ſtep below. Don't be jealous, my dear; my time is equally divided between you; and Maria may reſt aſſured of a liberal portion.</p>

                  <p>I FEEL diſpoſed to be dull. My friend marched yeſterday for the Weſtward. My aunt came to town a week before he left us. She has adopted a new plan, by which ſhe means to accompliſh a recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilement with her huſband. Confining herſelf to her chamber, ſhe gives out ſhe is extremely ill, and is continually endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to prepare our minds for her approaching death. It is, ſhe ſays, impoſſible for her to continue long among us; nor can ſhe be eaſy to quit the world without being previouſly reconciled to her huſband. To die among ſtrangers, to be buried from a ſtrange houſe, are ideas ſhe cannot ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. Repeatedly have I been ſummoned to her bed-ſide to take her laſt adieu, and as often commiſſioned to tell my uncle his unpardonable conduct had given a cruel

ſtab to her peace, drove her from home, and brought upon her complicated miſery, which had haſtened her end. She fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſolicits me to write to him, and requeſt of him one interview with his dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wife. Upon my refuſal, ſhe has ſent for her favourite, from his family, through whom, it is probable, ſhe will accompliſh her purpoſe. She is continually giving ſome new alarm, which keeps the houſe in conſtant agitation. If ſhe is not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful I am reſolved to quit my lodgings.</p>
                  <p>Previous to Captain Clark's leaving this city, he informed me, the brother of my dear Fanny, had obtained a Captain's commiſſion in the ſame regiment with him; and that the Secretary at War, in the letter in which he encloſed his commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, directs him to be in Philadelphia by the tenth of the month.</p>
                  <p>I have received a billet from a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, with whom I am entirely unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, informing me, Eliza has been in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia ſeveral months, and intends paſſing the winter in this place; this is friendly, but painful information.

But if ſhe wiſhes to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon Mrs. Leaſon and the family, ſhe muſt ſend to Trenton for her ſympathetic doctor; the city phyſicians are not to be deceived.

                  <p>MY uncle has, at length, been prevailed upon to viſit his diſtreſſed wife, who was confined to her bed. She has ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected her purpoſe.

She accordingly diſpatched invitations to her acquaintance, requeſting their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the next afternoon, "To witneſs <hi>the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newal of her marriage.</hi>" An elegant ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per was propoſed, which was to have been at her expenſe, had not the advice of her particular friends prevented it. The morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this happy day, my aunt aroſe from her bed, which ſhe had not left for ſeveral days, and with every pleaſure which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation gives, waited the coming mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

on being thus relieved; yet I fancy you are a little ſurpriſed at its taking place ſo ſoon; but an artful, determined mind can often get through apparent impoſſibil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities. It would be fortunate for my aunt, was ſhe reſolved to be happy; but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve if ſhe has any reflections, they are replete with diſcontent and wretchedneſs. She may perhaps experience a temporary gratification, but this will be ſhort; new contentions will ariſe; and tempers, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ungovernable, cannot eaſily be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained at ſo advanced a period of life. Had ſhe ever conſidered preſent actions, as though they had paſt, ſhe would never have expoſed to the world, a thouſand lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle incidents in her family, which a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent woman, would bluſh to have had known.</p>
                  <p>In the moſt happy connexions—in the beſt regulated families, many things take place, which ſhould be cautiouſly conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the eye of the world; and the woman who would expoſe the faults of her own family, muſt poſſeſs a diſpoſition which ſhould be ſeverely reprobated.</p>

It is a ſtep which injures the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acters of both, and is attended with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual mortifications. But if they are compelled to it, they ſhould, I think, abide by the unhappy alternative. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I may venture to aſſert, that, in few inſtances, has a ſeparation ever removed the cauſe of uneaſineſs, but rather increaſed the wretchedneſs, and rendered the parties diſreſpected by the world.</p>

                  <p>I AM ſeriouſly concerned for my friends at the Weſtward. Parties are daily leaving this city, to join the troops already there. A winter's campaign is alarming. For Fanny's ſake, I ſhall be glad when her brother has left us. The poor girl, is ſcarce able to ſupport the thought of his leaving her. She poſſeſſes a diſpoſition too tender for her own happineſs; and, I veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe, it occaſions all her ill health.</p>
                  <p>Laura's haughty behaviour, in ſeveral late inſtances, has determined me to paſs a few weeks in the country. Having been from infancy, taught to value herſelf upon a pretty face and a genteel perſon, ſhe thinks herſelf entitled to (unmerited) reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from all the boarders; and behaves as if external beauty was an ample com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation for the want of internal merit.
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:025584_0213_0FCE053266675450"/>
She conſiders a condeſcending diſpoſition as only neceſſary to thoſe who are deſtitute of the attractive charms of a handſome face, and believes the ſtudy of the belles-lettres, only calculated for ſuch as have no pretenſions to beauty. She cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alize, that an accompliſhed mind will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der happineſs durable, when the bloom of youth ſhall fade, and the tranſitory flower ſhall have waſted its ſweets. Nor does ſhe cultivate ideas which will render pleaſant the laſt ſtage of exiſtence. That ſtage, when the debilitated mind will look back to its trifling gratifications, with the moſt ſevere regret; when the want of better reflections, will obtrude the idea of her paſt life, upon her imbittered thoughts. But Fanny is a pleaſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt. She has caught from the refulgent beams of wiſdom, rays, which will adorn her character, and will render her, at every period of life, an entertaining, agreeable companion. Her heart expands for the unfortunate. "For each one's woes, ſhe has a tear."</p>

                  <p>YOUR couſin has arrived—he is ſo altered by an uniform, I did not know him; but when he handed me a letter, which he ſaid was from Maria, I recogniz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his countenance, and introduced him to Mrs. Leaſon, Laura and Fanny; to the laſt, as my particular friend. I view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, my dear, with all thoſe pleaſing ideas, which reſult from the conſideration he is your couſin.—I am ſorry you think me too ſevere upon my own ſex. You are deceived in your concluſions. The obſervations I made, as you advance in life, you will find to be juſt. I meant not to deviate from the ſtricteſt principles of philanthropy or good humour; and the traits I have drawn, are perfectly conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to many characters. If Maria is at preſent more happy in her companions and
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:025584_0215_0FCE0535F0573E80"/>
friends, I heartily rejoice; but give me leave to remind you, that a knowledge of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, can only be learnt by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience; and that inſincerity and deception too often characterize mankind.</p>
                  <p>I yeſterday received an invitation to paſs the afternoon and evening with my aunt Noble. Fanny was too depreſſed with the proſpect of parting with her broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to give us her company. The natural vivacity of her diſpoſition, withers at the recollection of his misfortunes. The idea of his ſufferings, ſharpens the arrows of her affliction.</p>
                  <p>I went early to Colonel Noble's, that I might have an opportunity to converſe a little with my aunt. Upon entering the doors, ſeveral new pieces of furniture, caught my attention. My aunt is not without her ambition, any more than the Colonel. I found her alone; congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated her upon her return, and hoped ſhe enjoyed all that happineſs ſhe had imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. "While my property laſts," ſaid ſhe, "it may do, but the little I have, will never provide for a family. At preſent, there is not an article brought into the
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:025584_0216_0FCE053758F04700"/>
houſe, but at my expenſe." We were now interrupted by company; for ſhe had given large invitations to her acquaintance for the celebration of this pleaſing event. Tea and cards preceded an elegant ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, prepared by this fooliſh woman, whoſe circumſtances rather call for the ſtricteſt economy, than allow of the ſmalleſt profuſion. For my own part, I know no minor, who ſtands more in need of a guardian, than my aunt Noble. A prodigal diſpoſition, is far from evincing a liberal mind; in any ſituation of life, it is to be avoided. The indulgence of it hurries us into a thouſand evtravagancies, which will finally be deſtructive to our happineſs. Her diſpoſition, united with the Colonel's, whoſe predominant paſſions are ſhow and parade, would ſoon exhauſt an extenſive fortune. My uncle is not, however, ſingular in his falſe ideas of greatneſs. There are many who will not deny themſelves the ſuperfluities of life, although the butcher and tradeſman, are continually dunning at the door.</p>
                  <p>I left my aunt's, diſguſted at her impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

conduct, and much diſpleaſed at that violent fondneſs they expreſs for each other. It is unnatural to believe ſuch cruel ſtabs, and recent wounds, have not cankered the mind. But if they poſſeſs ſuch heaven-born tempers as totally to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the paſt, we ſhould ſuppoſe, prudence would dictate to them to conceal the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of their affections. To ſee a couple continually fondling and kiſſing in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, is diſguſting, and cauſes in my breaſt ſuſpicions of their conjugal felicity; not that I would diſcourage that pleaſing, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate attention, which diſtinguiſhes the happy pair.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Lee yet continues in Philadelphia. Being with him, excites contending paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. While the ſprouts of gratitude ſhoot forth with luxuriance, memory awakens the painful remembrance of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretia's ſufferings. Mrs. Leaſon tells me, he has been ſome years married to a young lady in Briſtol, whom he now diſowns as his wife. I ſhall endeavour to inform my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of this circumſtance, when I viſit that place. I am impatient to enjoy a ſhort time the pleaſures of ſolitude. My

                  <p>CAPTAIN Gardner with his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty left this city yeſterday. Your couſin expects to ſtay with us but a few days. He has introduced a particular friend of his to our acquaintance—a General Hill. This gentleman is, I find, married. I pity his good lady. The army will do better for ſingle, than married men. Was I a wife, I ſhould never conſent to my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's commencing ſoldier.</p>
                  <p>I am not a little jealous Capt. Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour has an attachment for Fanny. Mrs. Leaſon has propoſed ſeveral matches for this dear girl. One young gentleman ſhe repreſents as deeply in love with her; and yeſterday ſeriouſly aſked me if I thought ſhe could not be prevailed upon to receive his addreſſes? Not by my interceſſion,
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:025584_0220_0FCE053F48815E40"/>
replied I, and haſtily left the room. This good lady grows more attached to dreſs. Her hair is craped and curled in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt taſte. Could I procure a London doll, marked with the wrinkles of old age, I would dreſs it by my landlady, as a pattern to your mamma. This attachment to dreſs, frequently places her in a ridiculous light. It injures the reputation of the ſex, by enforcing the idea of our vanity, and eſtabliſhing the illnatured obſervations of the world, depreciates us with men of ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>I am deceived, if Laura does not envy Fanny the attentions of Mr. Belmour. Your couſin is indeed, handſome; but a uniform, my dear, is a great addition. It is truly an attractive magnet with the <hi>fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male</hi> eye.</p>
                  <p>Fanny has received a letter from her mamma, which mentions, that a number of Captain Gardner's friends, had opened a ſubſcription, for the relief of her ſiſter, who they wiſhed to place in ſome little bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, which ſhould enable her to provide for herſelf and children.

How contracted the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of mankind! The avaricious miſer, lives but for himſelf, purſuing his plans with eagerneſs—with the moſt frigid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference, he paſſes objects of diſtreſs— eſtranged to the pleaſures of benevolence, which aims to blunt the edge of adverſity, he refuſes every relief. He knows not the luxury which reſults from having leſſened human wretchedneſs. Philanthropy and benevolence are not the characteriſtics of his heart. But ſympathetic minds, enjoy pleaſures with which theſe ſordid beings are unacquainted. They paſs through life with the ſweet reflection, of having relieved the diſtreſſed; and at the cloſe of exiſtence, derive a ſource of ſatisfaction from the grateful recollection. I am flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with the idea of your paſſing the approaching winter in this city; and am ſorry you poſtpone coming ſo long. Urge your mamma to ſet an earlier day.

                  <p>AGREEABLY to the promiſe in my laſt, I have forwarded the hiſtory of Mrs. Little. It ſhall be clothed in her own expreſſions—receive it as I had it from her.</p>
                  <p>"An unfortunate connexion, has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed my fond ideas of happineſs. At the age of ſeventeen, I was, after a court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of two years, united with a Mr. Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, then twenty-two. He was a foreigner, who had reſided ſome years among us. My parents and friends unanimouſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the match, and my juvenile fancy planned many happy ſcenes.</p>

                     <pb n="4" facs="unknown:025584_0228_0FCDE9F9116AC938"/>"Being an only daughter, my wiſhes were ever ſuperſeded by the attentions of my doating parents, and I flattered myſelf long to enjoy the preſent current of unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed felicity. But the morning which riſes with the cleareſt hemiſphere, is often obſcured by a ſtormy ſky. An unexpected circumſtance ſoon preſented, which oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mr. Little to croſs the ſeas. The voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age was ſhort. I had no idea of a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for more than a few months. With impatience I waited the period of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected arrival—I chid the dilatory hours—Time appeared to pauſe—I enjoyed no pleaſures—I ſhared in no amuſements; the anticipation of his return, engroſſed my whole attention. At length, the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel in which he ſailed, arrive. My broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er haſtened to meet him. In imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I was raiſed to the ſummit of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I believed uninterrupted pleaſures, would crown ſucceeding days. But the chilling froſt of diſappointment, blaſted my viſionary joys. Mr. Little was left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. Not a ſingle line did I receive from him, nor could any information be obtained of him; he having left the iſland from which
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:025584_0229_0FCE054973FF2840"/>
the veſſel came. Notwithſtanding this, little did my unſuſpecting heart, forebode his villainous intentions. Educated in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired life, I was unacquainted with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of the <hi>beau monde.</hi> Never having been accuſtomed to diſappointments, it was at firſt a leſſon difficult to learn.</p>
                  <p>"In this ſituation, I paſſed four years; when my father received a letter from a friend in South-Carolina, acquainting him, Mr. Little lived in Charleſton, with a woman to whom, it was reported, he was married. The contents of this letter, I obſtinately refuſed to credit. For more than two years, I reſolved not to liſten to the calumniating breath of the world; when the arrival of a particular friend from Carolina, opened my deluded eyes. Fortunately I poſſeſſed great reſolution. Yet, having to combat with a warm attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and all the pains of neglected affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I was attacked with a diſtreſſing ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which confined me ſome months to my chamber. During this time, I had many intervals of hope that Mr. Little might yet return, repenting his paſt conduct; till at length; having hackneyed every plea, which
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:025584_0230_0FCE054AFAC79F68"/>
affection, duty, and benevolence could ſuggeſt, I determined to reaſon myſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a diſpoſition, to relinquiſh him forever. This was a trying undertaking; but his conduct rendered it neceſſary. I now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted his name might never again, be mentioned to me, that, if poſſible, I might obliterate him from remembrance. Bleſt with indulgent parents, who have ſtudied to make me happy, I have been enabled to abide by my reſolution; or probably, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this, I ſhould have ended my days.</p>
                  <p>"Accuſtomed to a country life, I have devoted much time to reading: This at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment is ſtrengthened by affliction. Thus have I given you a detail of my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy ſituation. That I have given up every idea, of a man who had thus tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred his affections; who had forfeited the grateful title of my protector and friend, who had proved himſelf my ſeducer; my greateſt enemy, will not, I feel aſſured, prejudice your mind againſt me. For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, my heart ſhed its deareſt drops; and had not fortitude ſhielded me with the helmet of perſeverance, I ſhould have relapſed into former unbelief, But by
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:025584_0231_0FCE054C5B0FAC60"/>
her influence, and the conſideration of having done my duty, I riſe ſuperior to my fate. I make no animadverſions upon the conduct of Mr. Little, not doubting, although I have ſuffered thus ſeverely, you are more acquainted with the villainy of the world than myſelf."</p>
                  <p>What a hiſtory is the above. It veils my pleaſurable ideas: It unfolds to view a conduct, which, for the honour of human nature, I could wiſh, concealed. But how frequently do our ſex become wretched, by the deep laid plans of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed minds! When ſuch inſtances ſhade the characters of youth, they muſt tend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy our confidence in a ſex deſigned, by heaven, for our protection. And while they awaken our ſuſpicions, ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs us with a caution, neceſſary to guard our reputation and honour, from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed plans of the baſe libertine, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in the moſt villainous ſeductions, and who frequently ſelects the moſt virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of our ſex for deſtruction. Diſguiſing his ſentiments by virtuous intentions, he ſecures the affections of the object he aims to ruin; and having blaſted the unſullied

flower, leaves it to wither and decay. Mrs. Little now receives the addreſſes of a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman <hi>high in office</hi>; and it is expected, will be ſhortly married. Warm are my wiſhes for her future happineſs. May the intended connexion, compenſate for thoſe painful days ſhe has paſt, and the hitherto dreary path of her married life, be contraſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by future domeſtic endearments.</p>

                  <p>BEING upon a viſit, a few days ſince, to Mrs. Little, I took the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of making ſome inquiries concerning Mr. Lee; obſerving, various reports were circulating in Philadelphia. Upon my aſking if he really had a wife in that place, ſhe begged leave to introduce me to her aunt Watts, who could gratify my curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty reſpecting her couſin. Having no idea I was among the friends of this unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate woman; I felt diſtreſſed, leſt I had, unintentionally, injured their feelings; and made many apologies for my unguard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conduct. I had awakened the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of many painful circumſtances; and a ſilence of ſome minutes followed my imprudence. The thrilling tear, having relieved the acuteneſs of firſt emotions, Mrs. Watts requeſted to know "If I had
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:025584_0234_0FCE0554813A3580"/>
any acquaintance with Mr. Lee?" I told her I had boarded, ſome time, in the houſe with him. "You ſhall then," ſaid ſhe, "be informed, the true circumſtances of my dear Harriot's ſeduction.</p>
                  <p>"My niece was left in infancy, an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan. In humanity to her tender years, I took her under my protection. It was not in my power to educate her in gay life, but I neglected not to inſtil virtuous principles upon her mind; and ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the common inſtructions of a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſchool. The eſtate of her father being rendered inſolvent, ſhe depended entirely upon her character for a ſettlement in life. Her conſtitution was ſlender, and inade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to the common offices of a country living. Attached to her needle, ſhe ſoon imbibed a turn for millinery, and engroſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the work of this place. Her figure was naturally genteel. Her taſte fanciful, and her features, though not perfectly regular, expreſſive and ſoft.</p>
                  <p>"At the age of ſixteen, ſhe had the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to attract the notice of Mr. Lee, who frequented this road, in his excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to Bordentown. He became ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:025584_0235_0FCE0555633FE148"/>
with her, and we believed his intentions honourable. Unfortunately for the dear girl, ſhe now loſt her uncle. Soon after this, Mr. Lee propoſed marriage, and with my conſent, a day was fixed for the wedding.</p>
                  <p>"A few days after the laſt publication had taken place, he urged her to accompany him to Philadelphia. As I wiſhed her to purchaſe a few articles for herſelf, I joined in his requeſt, little thinking I was acceding to her ruin. He had not rode far, when he propoſed they ſhould be married <hi>before they returned</hi> from Philadelphia. Harriot, knowing of no obſtacles, agreed to the wiſhes of Mr. Lee; and, in the evening, the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony was, as ſhe believed, performed. Upon their return, he introduced her to me as his wife; nor did I once ſuſpect the fraud.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Lee's buſineſs calling him to Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia, and Harriot's health rendering it neceſſary ſhe ſhould reſide in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ſhe never left me; and from this time, for three years, he uniformly viſited her ſeveral times a week. But he now began
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:025584_0236_0FCE0556D83599F0"/>

I fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently addreſſed him by letter, but receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no reply. At length I wrote to a friend in Philadelphia for the character of Mr. Lee, who, affected with my ſtory, made me a viſit, and revealed his villainous decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; aſſuring me, that the ceremony was performed by an abandoned rake, dreſſed for that purpoſe: That the houſe to which he carried Harriot, was kept by a woman of ill fame; and that the company, to which ſhe was introduced, were the moſt profligate of her ſex.</p>
                  <p>"Knowing the tenderneſs of her diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I thought it beſt to draw her off from him by degrees, and took every opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to inſinuate, that ſhe would never ſee him again; but ſhe could not be perſuaded to entertain ideas incompatible with his hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Lee's affection. "Life is a burden," ſaid ſhe, "miſery is my doom." I ſent for a lawyer in the neighbourhood, requeſting him to viſit Mr. Lee at the tavern, and threaten him with a proſecution; but he laughed at his baſeneſs, ſaying, we were fools to think he ever meant to be confined to one—"I will rove at large; they may do as they pleaſe." A depreſſion enſued, which brought on a rapid conſumption, and ſhe is now ſinking under complicated diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</p>
                  <p>"Thus has Mr. Lee loaded her with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy and diſtreſs. But a period of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe muſt come, when with ſorrow, and, I hope, a ſincere repentance, he will regret his deviation from virtue." At this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſhe was called to her niece.</p>
                  <p>The cruel conduct of Mr. Lee, made a deep impreſſion upon my mind. How does deceiving man triumph over female innocence; crop the ſweet flower of virtue, and boaſt his inſidious plans! Beauty, ſimplicity and virtue, too often, fall a prey to a diſſembled paſſion.</p>

                  <p>YESTERDAY a billet was handed me from Mrs. Watts, requeſting to ſee me. I haſtened to comply with the invitation. When I reached the houſe, I ſent my name to her. She hurried down ſtairs, apologized for the liberty ſhe had taken, and obſerving it was the wiſh of her niece to ſee an acquaintance of Mr. Lee's, and viewing it as one of her laſt requeſts, ſhe choſe to gratify her. I aſſured her it would be pleaſing to me to afford any ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfaction to her or Harriot. "The unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate girl," ſaid ſhe, "can remain but a few hours—every ſymptom of diſſolving nature faſt approaches; but I will go and acquaint her, you are below."</p>
                  <p>In a few minutes ſhe returned, and I followed her to the diſtreſſing chamber.

Upon her opening the door, every object filled me with horror. The ſhutters were cloſed. At the ſight of the emaciated, heart-broken afflicted girl, bolſtered up in her bed, my reſolution left me, and I was ſeized with a faintneſs. I had recourſe to my ſmelling bottle; and ſeating myſelf at her ſide, ſhe appeared to be dozing. "Harriot," ſaid her aunt, "this is Miſs Francis, whom you wiſhed to ſee." Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at me with an eye, which was ſunk deep in its ſocket, and extending her hand with a feeble voice ſhe could juſt articulate, "The goodneſs of your heart will excuſe my inclination. I wiſhed to ſee you, that you might acquaint Mr. Lee with what I ſhall intruſt to you; that you, who was a ſtranger to me in former life, ſhould witneſs my dying words; and that in theſe all-important moments, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare him to be <hi>my huſband.</hi> Tell him from me, the time will come, when that ſilent monitor, conſcience, will be true to its truſt. The intoxications of debauchery and pleaſure, however they may enchant in the moments of enjoyment, will then

be deprived of their charms; and though the grave will have buried my ſufferings, he will conſider himſelf as the diſturber of my peace, the deſtroyer of my health, and the ſhortner of my days; but not the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupter of my heart. Though I have been rendered wretched by his villainy, my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence is unſullied." Diſtreſſed for breath, ſhe was ſome time unable to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. When a little recovered, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, "Painful recollections do not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter the cloſe of my days; and well would it be for my ſeducer, if his retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpections were alike pleaſing; but happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is too ſtrongly cemented with virtue to be his companion. Witneſs to the world, I die a ſacrifice to the villainy of an unprincipled man. Exert yourſelf to ſave, from ſimilar wretchedneſs, any who ſhall be ſo unfortunate as to attract his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice."</p>
                  <p>Her diſorder would not ſuffer her to ſay more. I ſat ſome time by her ſide; it growing late, I was induced to retire; and promiſing to ſee her in the morning, I took my leave of the affecting ſcene. Early the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:025584_0242_0FCE05639C91B880"/>
next day, Mrs. Little ſent to acquaint me that Harriot had winged her way to the realms of eternal bliſs.</p>
                  <p>So many painful circumſtances have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged my attention, ſince my arrival in this village, that my preconceived pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures have fled. Poſſeſſed of a warm im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agination and eaſy circumſtances, my fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy frequently depictures gratifications I can never enjoy. Harriot has intruſted me with a painful commiſſion. A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion I ſhall not be able, perſonally, to execute.</p>
                  <p>Fanny has been attacked with a ſpitting of blood—I muſt, therefore, haſten to the city for advice. Let us beware, my dear Maria, of the deceptions of a ſex, whoſe ſtudy is, too often, to enſnare the innocent and virtuous; and conſtantly invoke the protection of that guardian power, who alone can ſhield us from every danger.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE again returned to the noiſy city. Fanny is much better. Her phyſician adviſed to opening a vein. This has been twice repeated within a few days.</p>

                  <p>Mrs. Leaſon and Laura, have urged Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and myſelf to accompany them to the theatre.

                  <p>I ALMOST regret the day which gave me birth; as I ſeem deſtined to make wretched every family in which I reſide.</p>
                  <p>Since my laſt, by Major Holmes, a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance truly diſtreſſing has taken place. In that, I acquainted you of my promiſe to attend Mrs. Leaſon and Laura to the theatre. Judge, Maria, my feelings, when I found myſelf in the adjoining box to Eliza. By her expreſſive countenance, I was convinced ſhe noticed me; and from what I had experienced, doubted not her imagination was engaged, inventing new ſchemes againſt me. Upon each wriſt, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a bracelet; and by a light which was near her, diſcovered that one was the picture of the unfortunate Clarimont; the other, a repreſentation of that rural retreat
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:025584_0246_0FCE056C22398920"/>
which proved the introduction to all my misfortunes. <hi>Philoclea</hi> was the tragedy performed this evening. It was a play to which I was partial; but having ſeverely experienced the vindictive diſpoſition of this unhappy woman, I could not diveſt myſelf of many fears, which forced them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon me, and obſcured the whole en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment. The letter, which I informed you I had received from a perſon unknown, ſhould have prevented my imprudence in thus venturing into a croud. I wiſhed to tell Mrs. Leaſon my diſcovery, but was too cloſely watched by Eliza. When the play was over, I begged Laura not to be in haſte. Mr. Hart, the gentleman who had eſcorted us thither, waited upon Mrs. Leaſon and myſelf to the carriage, and a gentleman who ſat in the ſame box with us, requeſted the honour of attending Laura; who, fond of attention, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſpicious of any plans againſt me, accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his offer: The crowd ſoon ſeparated us. We waited at the door a conſiderable time for her, until her mamma, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe had taken another carriage, deſired
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:025584_0247_0FCE056D5B00D780"/>
our driver to haſten home; but different ideas ruſhed upon my mind; ideas I dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not avow. When we reached the houſe, Laura had not arrived. Mrs. Leaſon go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up ſtairs to undreſs, I took the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to tell Mr. Hart my fears; who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly walked out in ſearch of her. Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, previous to our return, had retired to bed. When Mrs. Leaſon came down, finding her daughter yet abſent, ſhe began to be alarmed. The other boarders ſoon came in; Mrs. Leaſon acquainting them with the circumſtance, they immediately agreed to take different routs, and enjoin it upon the city watch to patrol the ſtreets, and ſtop all perſons paſſing through the night. I was now left to afford all the conſolation, and to encourage all the hopes an imagination inexpreſſibly agitated could ſuggeſt. A degree of delirium ſeized her unhappy mother. The ſluices of maternal grief were opened, and ſorrow, like a peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential exhalation, corrupted every pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure. In this diſtreſs we counted the ſilent hours of night, and when the day beamed its rays upon us, the gentlemen returned,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:025584_0248_0FCE05704C617AB8"/>
but unſucceſsful. At this period, every proſpect of Laura's recovery was obſcured.</p>
                  <p>It was now neceſſary to communicate the painful information to Fanny. This, if poſſible, I would have avoided; for misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes are doubly barbed, when directed at the boſom of ſenſibility and ſympathy; and theſe were among the darling virtues which ſhone conſpicuous in the boſom of my friend.</p>
                  <p>This dear girl, diſcovering the ſituation of my mind, commanded her own ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Her diſpoſition is indeed uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſerene. The mild virtues of philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy are implanted in her breaſt.</p>
                  <p>The gentlemen having refreſhed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, renewed their ſearch. Mrs. Leaſon's mind, like barren winter, preſented nought but dreary proſpects. Were I to attempt a deſcription of my ſufferings, through th<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality.</p>
                  <p>In the evening it was agreed, by a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Laura's friends, to form ſeveral par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and watch certain ſuſpicious houſes, without the limits of the city, concluding
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:025584_0249_0FCE0571DF414C08"/>
it probable ſhe might have been carried to one of theſe for the preſent. They accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, at an early hour, took their appointed poſts.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Leaſon had refuſed every nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and was now ſo exhauſted, that we no ſooner recovered her from one fainting-fit, than ſhe relapſed into another. Cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſable livery of affliction, neither Fanny nor myſelf could afford her conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Between the hours of eleven and twelve a carriage ſtopped at the door. I flew to the head of the ſtairs to inform myſelf if any intelligence was obtained of Laura, when I heard Mr. Hart deſire the ſervant to tell Mrs. Leaſon, Miſs Laura would ſoon be at home. Eager to give the pleaſing news, I was returning to the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but a ſudden fainting-fit deprived me of my ſenſes, and I fell upon the floor. Fanny, alarmed at the noiſe, ran into the entry to diſcover the cauſe, and calling ſome aſſiſtance, had me conveyed into the parlour. When I recovered, I obſerved Laura in a chair near me. The friends, who had ſhared with us in the ſorrows of
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:025584_0250_0FCE057358035E90"/>
the day, were engaged in comforting her and reſtoring me; while Fanny, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Mrs. Leaſon, was aſſuring her of her daughter's ſafety.</p>

                  <p>THE meeting between Laura and her mamma, was a real picture of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and gratitude. It was an inexpreſſibly pleaſing event, in which words were uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. In this inſtance the ſilent, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive language of the eye, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing demonſtrations of reciprocal joy, evinced in their conduct, declared their real feelings, better than the moſt ſtudied ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions. I was impatient to become ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with her ſtory; but the confuſion of the family prevented my wiſhes until the next day, when Mr. Hart gave me the circumſtances of her recovery as follows: "Being concealed within view of the houſe, to which we imagined ſhe might have been carried, we remained without any diſcovery until after ten, when a carriage
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:025584_0252_0FCE05771B67D2C8"/>
ſtopped at the door. We now walked up to it; and juſt as they had forced Laura out of the door of the houſe, a piſtol I had in my hand, accidentally went off, at which the horſes took fright; and thoſe who had hold of her, inſtantly fled; while myſelf and party, ran to her aſſiſtance. It was for ſome time, impoſſible to convince her that ſhe was under the protection of her friends; nor has ſhe given us any account of her being carried away." Thus far gratified, I was obliged to wait, until Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra was ſufficiently compoſed to acquaint us with the manner of her being carried off. When ſhe aſſured her mamma, ſhe was hurried through the croud, and handed into a carriage, by a gentleman who ſat in the box with us, who accompanied her to the place from which ſhe was reſcued by Mr. Hart. Here ſhe was confined to a chamber, and attended by a woman, from whom ſhe learnt, that ſhe was to be removed further into the country the next night; and muſt take her final leave of Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia. She repeatedly aſked, why ſhe was thus torn from all her friends? but could obtain no anſwer. In the evening ſhe was
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:025584_0253_0FCE05789B1B6460"/>
told a coach was come to take her from this place, and ſhe was immediately hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down ſtairs to the door from whence, as above related, ſhe was reſcued by Mr. Hart.</p>
                  <p>This affair has given a freſh ſtab to my enjoyments. It deprive me of the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction I flattered myſelf to have received from the ſociety of my friends. I feel a laſſitude I cannot deſcribe. The anxiety of Mrs. Leaſon and Laura has produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fevers, which at preſent run high. It will require ſome time for them to recover their health. I am deſtined to the ſevereſt trials—continually involving my friends in affliction. The idea ſaps every promiſed pleaſure; and I find their anticipation a chimera. May your friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip animate my heart—be to Caroline a Mentor, who, recalling her wandering thoughts, ſhall remind her, that although philoſophy directs us to fortitude, religion is the only ſupport in the ſtorms of life.</p>

                  <p>MRS. Leaſon and Laura are better.</p>
                  <p>This recent affair, has determined me never again to venture in public. I am at times diſpoſed to retire to ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequented ſpot, and by aſſuming a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent habit and name, endeavour to live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturbed in obſcurity. Fanny is urgent for me to take the advice of my friends, with reſpect to ſecuring Eliza. But I have no proof againſt her, unleſs the letter to me, after Clarimont's death, will be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ſuch. I intend, however, to write to Captain Evremont for his advice. My preſent ſituation is critical. I have no friends in Philadelphia, whoſe duty it is to protect me; and fear is viewed as the child
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:025584_0255_0FCE057CA11BA1B8"/>
of guilt. But why ſhould all my happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be ſacrificed to the jealous diſpoſition of a diſappointed woman, who is certainly the ſource of my misfortunes?</p>
                  <p>A letter is this moment handed me from Captain Evremont. It contains the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain accounts of my couſin's having fallen a victim to ſavage ferocity, inſtead of his being killed at the defeat of Major Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lys. This intelligence he has received ſeveral ways. Yattacheu, a friendly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, who has been ſeveral days at Fort-Pitt, has given the moſt direct information, of his being burnt by ſlow fires, near the Miami villages. This ſtory is corroborat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a priſoner lately returned to camp, who was taken in the ſame defeat; but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately obtained his ranſom, through the interpoſition of a gentleman trading among them, who formerly lived in the ſame town with him.</p>
                  <p>What hope do I encourage, which is not deſtroyed by the breath of diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Every object recals the tortured body to my view; my heart is warped

with the moſt tenebrous ideas, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune awaits me upon every ſide. Our friends ſtrongly attach us to life. To part with them is painful—but to part with them, by the aggravated tortures of ſavage invention, is an inſupportable reflection. May I not, in this caſe, ſay, "Memory thou ſting!" Providence has prepared a double portion of affliction for your friend. Frequently doth the big drop, burſt from my eye. But I will watch every murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thought.</p>
                  <p>By the ſame conveyance is handed me a letter from Captain Clark; a copy of which I ſhall encloſe to you; not becauſe it contains any particular information, but the ſtyle in which it is dictated, I am ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, will be grateful to my friend. Ye guardian powers, who protect the thread of human life, extend your watchful care, to the boſom of that wilderneſs, which contains Columbia's favourite ſons; let not the nervy arms ſucceſsful in ſecuring the liberties of this Weſtern World, be ſubdued by ſavage power; ſcreen them from every danger, and ſafely return them to more tranquil honours.</p>

                           <p>AGREEABLY to the promiſes of friendſhip, and the wiſhes of my own heart, I improve the preſent opportunity to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after my friends.</p>
                           <p>The deranged ſtate of the army ſince my arrival at Fort-Pitt, has alone prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me from commencing a correſpondence ſo flattering to my vanity; and by which I ſhall receive the communications of a ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, tempered by judgment, matured by obſervation, and heightened by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing information of the welfare of many friends, I eſteem in Philadelphia. Captain Evremont had almoſt diſcouraged me from writing, by reading me a paragraph in one of your letters, wherein you expreſs a great degree of diffidence in regard to addreſſing me, and beg him to intercede for you.</p>
                           <p>I have frequently been favoured with the peruſal of detached parts of your let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to him, and think my friend Caroline muſt be <hi>unpardonably diffident</hi> of her own

abilities, or ſuppoſe me moſt <hi>conſummately</hi> vain of mine; to expreſs a wiſh, that I ſhould overlook faults, if any exiſt, beyond my comprehenſion; and which I am not ſufficiently acquainted with language to criticiſe.</p>
                           <p>You juſtly obſerve, in your laſt letter to the Captain, "That many a man who wears the uniform and cockade, cannot reconcile the idea of parting with his friends, and commencing citizen of the world." I confeſs there are ſituations in life, more grateful to my feelings, and in which I could be happier. I am, howev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, bleſt with a diſpoſition for a military life, which will ever lead my inclination to a parallel with my duty. Your remarks alſo, reſpecting the uniform and cockade, are unhappily too true. The female mind <hi>delighted</hi> by <hi>appearances,</hi> too often betrays the heart into error, miſery and ruin. "<hi>Encircled as we are with friends, whoſe ideas and wiſhes are correſpondent with our own, you fancy no circumſtance can allay our happineſs. "In their ſociety,"</hi> you add, "<hi>no</hi> plebeian <hi>principles intrude; but every</hi> lord <hi>may exerciſe his full authority, and receive his

                           <p>Several Indians have been admitted to private conference with the General, and the ſuperior officers to a knowledge of their buſineſs to which my rank does not entitle me.</p>
                           <p>It is thought by the army that we ſhall leave this place as ſoon as the expected troops arrive. Tell Fanny her brother came into camp yeſterday, in good health, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to be remembered to you both.</p>
                           <p>That my friends ſhould be thus particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in the aſſurances of their eſteem, flatters me much: They may be aſſured, that my heart moſt <hi>ſenſibly</hi> accords with my wiſhes for their happineſs.

                  <p>MANY things concur to render me unhappy. The expoſed ſituation of my friends at the Weſtward—Being myſelf without a protector, Fanny's ill health, and the melancholy certainty of my couſin's tortures, are alone ample cauſes of anxiety and pain. Our happineſs through life, Maria, is unavoidably connected with that of our friends. Captain Clark's letter, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes ſuch unmerited encomiums, that I have regretted ſending it to you. But you muſt remember, my dear, it is a tenet of the gentlemen, that they cannot render themſelves agreeable to our ſex, unleſs they ſacrifice their ſincerity at the ſhrine of flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. This is indeed the leſſon they have received, from that celebrated courtier, Lord Cheſterfield, according to whoſe
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:025584_0262_0FCE058A982C2BE0"/>
ideas, no "<hi>Compliment is too groſs for the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male ear.</hi>" Although his lordſhip, in this obſervation, confined the gratefulneſs of flattery to the "<hi>Female ear,</hi>" he was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf convinced, it was a language pleaſing to human nature, and ſtrictly obſerved it, upon all occaſions. It would, however, be a pleaſing idea, if this ſentiment was not, in connexion with others, ruinous to the morals of ſociety. When I read his letters, I regret, a book ſo fatal to the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the community, ſo replete with poiſon to the youthful mind, ſhould ever have been publiſhed. In youth the imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ination is warm, the paſſions ſtrong, and without incitement, they are prone to err. Lord Cheſterfield's accompliſhments, if a character practiſed in deception, and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in intrigue, can be ſtyled <hi>accompliſhed,</hi> could never be ſubſtituted for thoſe virtues, in which he was moſt ſtrikingly deficient. His inſtructing his ſon in the arts of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction and adultery, is an error which can never be approved, by the moſt licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and depraved.</p>
                  <p>It being the immediate province of our ſex, to implant the firſt leſſons of inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                  <p>CAPTAIN Clark's letter diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers a depreſſion which gives me pain; but he is not the only friend compelled to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue a mode of life, derogatory to his wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. The unfortunate Mr. Gardner, has alſo been obliged to relinquiſh the ſociety of a beloved wife; to tear himſelf from the engaging prattle of his infant children; to quit a home, which might have been rendered peaceful and happy, had the breaſt of his brother, been filled with that ſympathy, which is an ornament to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. But there are myſteries in Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which human wiſdom cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal; and we frequently ſee one brother loaded with a redundance of fortune's gifts, devoid of a ſoul to relieve another, equally deſerving, who experiences the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſing wants.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="41" facs="unknown:025584_0265_0FCE0590A3475388"/>The miſer, what a ſordid worm! Full of anxiety, he purſues his ſpeculations; he eats the bread of carefulneſs; he ſmothers every ſpark of benevolence; his character is ſhaded by inhumanity; and his name becomes odious, even to his friends.</p>
                  <p>I have received a morning's viſit from my aunt Noble. She had been ſhopping, and has purchaſed a variety of finery. While ſhe has a copper left, it will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for her to reſtrain her prodigal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. I inquired if my uncle was likely to get buſineſs? She replied, there was no proſpect of it at preſent, and that ſhe ſoon expected to want the neceſſaries of life. Strange woman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thought I, that with ſuch ideas can be thus indiſcreet. She acquainted me with a ſecret, which ſhe determines to keep inviolate; but I will pledge my word, if ſhe ſhould, it will be the firſt that ever ſhe kept in her life. Nay, could I trace her to the houſes ſhe has viſited this morning, I dare aſſert, I ſhould find it already communicated to every family.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="42" facs="unknown:025584_0266_0FCE059357E42278"/>"The Colonel and ſhe, have not ſpoke to each other for ſeveral days." Old quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels are renewed. Solomon's words are eſtabliſhed. "A continual dropping in a rainy day, and a contentious woman are alike."</p>
                  <p>This great ſecret was told before Mrs. Leaſon, Laura and Fanny. Her viſit was ſhort, conſequently the more agreeable to her niece. She had to call at ſeveral places; and if by accident ſhe ſhould fall into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with intire ſtrangers to her, or her ſituation, I would forfeit half I poſſeſs in the world, if ſhe did not acquaint them with all her grievances.</p>
                  <p>I find my aunt's tears of irritability are yet at command. The weakneſs of her conduct has created her many enemies: She has made herſelf the deriſion of the city. Many who wiſh her well, in juſtice to themſelves, are obliged to withdraw from her ſociety: For however mankind are diſpoſed to befriend the unfortunate, they are ſoon wearied with a recital of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints; and the leſs we proclaim our cares and troubles abroad, the more we ſhall be

reſpected. It is neceſſary, as much as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, to baniſh them from our own minds. The journey of life is ſhort—and it is folly to mar preſent enjoyment, by a rehearſal of evils, or to purſue objects as neceſſary to our happineſs, which lie far beyond our reach; and which, if we have the good fortune to attain, ſtill leave us far diſtant from felicity. Duty directs us to enjoy the preſent moment, and not to hanker af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſomething unpoſſeſſed.</p>
                  <l>"Not happineſs itſelf makes good her name,</l>
                  <l>Our very wiſhes, give us not our wiſh:</l>

                  <l>From that for which we doat, felicity."</l>
                  <p>It is frequently the caſe, that the very periods, which we were ſo impatient ſhould arrive, reach us without the power to ſatisfy, or we ſoon become ſatiated with poſſeſſion. Unfortunately our greateſt enjoyments proceed from the expectation of a future good, we wiſh to obtain a ſomething be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our reach, and <hi>Hope,</hi> that friendly companion of human life, animates us in the purſuit.

life, till old age overtakes us, and we fall a victim to its attendant diſeaſes.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE the pleaſure to congrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulate my dear Maria, upon the arrival of her brother, from the Weſt-Indies. Moſt feelingly do I wiſh to add, the re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his health; but although he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys a greater ſhare, than when he left Philadelphia, he is yet an invalid. Mrs. Leaſon and Laura are ſo far recovered as to be below. Fanny is at preſent better; but I fear the diſorder will finally ſettle upon her—ſuch repeated attacks muſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially weaken her conſtitution.</p>
                  <p>I laſt week, made one of a large party to your aunt. She is indeed, an <hi>amiable, ſenſible,</hi> and <hi>accompliſhed woman.</hi> Having ever been accuſtomed to the ſtyle in which ſhe now lives, ſhe is free from thoſe ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilious airs, which many of our <hi>preſent gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:025584_0270_0FCE0598FA4D2008"/>
aſſume.</hi> In her family is the ſtricteſt regularity. Liberality is here ſeen without profuſion—Grandeur without oſtentation.</p>
                  <p>Mr. P. is a man, poſſeſſed of talents, which would reflect ſuperior honour upon him, if he would conſent to fill the <hi>vacancy</hi> in <hi>government,</hi> to which he has been <hi>appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>; but having declined the <hi>repeated wiſhes</hi> of his country, it is his determination to cloſe his days in private life. He is indeed juſtly eſteemed for the ſolidity of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, his unblemiſhed integrity, and the virtues of his heart.</p>
                  <p>Here I was introduced to a Mrs. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams, a lady, with whoſe character I have long been acquainted, and I have no doubt but public fame has alſo given it to Maria; but leaſt you ſhould in this reſpect be <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly</hi> ignorant, I will acquaint you. She is originally from New-England; and poſſeſſes a ſtriking levity of diſpoſition, which, with an exceſſive vanity, leads her to a conduct that renders her diſreſpected. For ſeveral years paſt, ſhe has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant with the etiquette of the polite world, and lives in a ſtyle, few Americans
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:025584_0271_0FCE059A584E80F0"/>
will attempt to imitate. Her whole ſtudy is, to ſurpaſs the gay circle in which, like the gaudy butterfly, ſhe flutters, to diſplay her variegated colours, and peculiar rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of apparel.</p>
                  <p>In the courſe of converſation ſhe obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, "It gave her great pleaſure to antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the time, when a proper diſtinction would be paid to the characters of the rich and elevated; for the preſent equality was horribly mortifying. It is now im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to obtain any article of dreſs which is not immediately copied by the vulgar. A few weeks ſince I ordered my milliner to make a hat in the neweſt and moſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant taſte. Agreeably to my directions it was ſuperbly decorated, and I thought the price it coſt would prevent imitation; but the ſecond time I wore it. I was mortified to find Mrs. B. with one exactly reſembling it; and going home, I committed my own to the flames."</p>
                  <p>This <hi>noble</hi> lady is united with a man, who, by the moſt fortuitous events, has gained an elevated office, and the moment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary breath of popularity. But although
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:025584_0272_0FCE059CB64FC730"/>
ſhe at preſent baſks in the indulgence of her conſummate arrogance; yet high as her huſband has been raiſed to honour, and bountifully as his country has provided for him, the proviſion will fall infinitely ſhort of the calls of a woman who has no bounds to her extravagance.</p>
                  <p>From the obſervations I made upon her conduct, during the afternoon and evening, I am convinced, this motto may be affixed to her arms, "<hi>a ſhort life and a merry one.</hi>" She has forgot the times that are paſt, when the occupation of her huſband placed her in a ſphere of life, far different from that in which ſhe now moves; ſhe is alſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful, that, by the voice of the people, he came into political exiſtence; and that the ſame voice can deprive him of his hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, and return him to that maſs of "<hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Citizens</hi>" from which he ſprang. Her conduct is cenſured, even by her friends; but fancying herſelf beyond the reach of envy, ſhe "<hi>Bids defiance to the low aſperſions of plebeian calumny,</hi>" and purſues her fav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourite pleaſures. Mr. Williams, bewilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with her ideas of greatneſs, which ſhe
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:025584_0273_0FCE059E19D6BF00"/>
lineally inherits, appears equally intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated.</p>
                  <p>In this uncertain tide of her proſperity, it would ſurely be friendly, to remind her ſhe may fall, and again commence the wife of a <hi>plebeian.</hi> But I believe ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders reflection, as too laborious an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment for a faſhionable mind. Convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that you will excuſe my deviating from my own ſtory, I ſhall ever feel at liberty to communicate ſuch as occur to me; and while they tend to unfold the vanity of the human heart, I flatter myſelf they will not be unacceptable to Maria.</p>

                  <p>A FEW days ſince, Fanny re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a letter from her ſiſter Gardner, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting her with the late ſeverity of her brother: Who no ſooner ſaw this diſtreſſed woman, placed by her friends in a ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which they flattered themſelves, would enable her to ſupply the calls of an infant family, than he made a preſſing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, for what his brother owed him, and has finally obliged her to give him her obligation, to pay him weekly, a certain proportion, until both principal and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſhall be diſcharged. And having late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come into poſſeſſion of the houſe ſhe now occupies, he has greatly added to her rent, and requires indubitable bondſmen for her punctual payment of it. La Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer's obſervation, when ſpeaking of char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acters ſimilar to Mr. Gardner, is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

verified. "They are neither," ſays he, "fit for friends, citizens, nor chriſtians. If you admit them any merit, it is becauſe they have money."</p>
                  <p>The unfeeling mind, is unacquainted with thoſe ſublime emotions, which digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the benevolent heart. Your brother, whoſe breaſt yields to every tender call of humanity, was preſent when Fanny open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the letter. He watched her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, diſcovered her uneaſineſs, and urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be acquainted with the cauſe. In vain did ſhe attempt to conceal her ſorrow; his curioſity was not to be evaded; and ſubmitting to his entreaties, ſhe gave me the letter, and left the room. I hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to him. No ſooner was he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the contents, than he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed a letter to Mrs. Gardner, in which he encloſed the mortgage of a houſe in Havre-de-Grace, begging her acceptance of it; with permiſſion to draw upon him, for the ſum neceſſary to diſcharge Mr. Gardner's debt. An act of generoſity this, which doubly endears him to my heart. Bleſt with a fortune which enables
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:025584_0276_0FCE05A35E0CFE40"/>
him to indulge his philanthropic wiſhes, he is indefatigable in purſuit of diſtreſſed objects. And conſidering himſelf reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to the Deity, for the property he has beſtowed upon him, he believes it his duty to leſſen the wants of the afflicted. I am convinced it is a grateful reflection to your mind, that thoſe virtues, for which your deceaſed <hi>father</hi> was ſo juſtly revered, are tranſmitted to his <hi>only ſon</hi>; and that in the brother, the parent yet lives.</p>
                  <p>Left early in life an heir to ſuch immenſe property, great was the danger which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed him; but bleſt with a religious education, he was armed againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citements of the world; and viewing vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue as the only road to happineſs, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded the vanities of life. Free from the oſtentation of youth, he holds exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal pomp as uſeleſs; making it his endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to alleviate human ſorrow; his health will not permit his perſonal attention to buſineſs, but the mercantile connexion he formed immediately after his father's death, renders his attendance unneceſſary. His lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erality to the Univerſity at Rhode-Iſland, of which he is a <hi>member,</hi> united with his
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:025584_0277_0FCE05A4D98900A8"/>
many public and private acts of charity, render him conſpicuouſly beloved. Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form in his diſpoſition to do good, he viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its the humble dwelling of poverty, and privately affords his aſſiſtance; while num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are relieved by his benificence, who know not, from whence the bounty flows.</p>
                  <p>How different is the diſpoſition of Mr. Belmour, from the general characteriſtic of the world, who are ſeldom affected with a diſtant view of misfortunes. Did the ſons of proſperity, imbibe ſentiments ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilar to him, how much would misfortunes be alleviated. We ſhould not then ſee a Gardner, depriving the widow, and the orphan, of their little property, to defray a paltry rent, which their narrow circum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtances, diſabled them from paying. We ſhould not then find one brother, callous to the wants of another, <hi>deſtitute</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant,</hi> but univerſal benevolence and love would govern the actions of man. Pardon my repeating to you, deeds which will immortalize the name of your broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. And believe that the language of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulation, is foreign from the heart of</p>

                  <p>BY a letter received by the poſt this evening, from Capt. Evremont, I find, he had drawn twenty days proviſion, and was to leave Pittſburg, for Fort-Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton the fifth of September. This fort is three hundred miles from the place where my letter was dated. What an extent of country already ſeparates us! and what innumerable difficulties muſt the army en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, before they return to the wiſhes of their friends! Convinced that you will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge me in my moralizing reflections, I ſhall not apologize for thoſe ſentiments which may flow from my pen, for I cannot avoid being thoughtful upon the preſent occaſion. That human life is of a cobweb texture is an idea which ſhould be impreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon our minds. This would tend to

In youth we too often look with impatient expectation, to thoſe enjoyments which we fondly imagine will be connected with mat<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

Where are thoſe that once crouded the buſy

ſtreets, graſping after riches, popularity and fame? Are they not enſhrined in the ſilent tomb, and become objects unfit for ſight? This will alſo be the caſe with us, in a few revolving years: Nay, perhaps we have already taken the final leave of friends dear unto us. What are the objects which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage our daily attention but ſhadows, that make a momentary impreſſion, and leave, upon recollection, an imperfect remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance—paſſing from us with ſuch velocity as mutually to efface each other!</p>
                  <p>Let us not then ſuffer ourſelves to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come infatuated with the foibles and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the world, which too often enſlave us by their opinions, and frequently make us the objects of their deriſion; but while the votaries of vacant gratifications ſummon their idle amuſements to aſſiſt the flight of time, may we paſs thoſe moments of relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, which nature demands, in ſuch pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits as will tend to ſtrengthen, rather than weaken the mind.</p>

                  <p>FANNY lately received a letter from her mamma, by a Mr. Gibbins, whom ſhe wiſhed Mrs. Leaſon to accommodate with lodgings; but the houſe was then ſo full of boarders, it was not in her power to entertain him. This gentleman is nearly ſixty years old, and a widower with a large fortune; he has, however, been our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant viſitor; and I ſincerely believe our landlady flattered herſelf ſhe had made a conqueſt; for the whole artillery of her charms have been arranged upon the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The barber has been employed to new model her head, and has ſupplied her with a falſe dreſs, which partially conceals the emblem of her age. But a few evenings ſince, he made a declaration, by which ſhe diſcovered it was his intention to perſuade ſome pretty girl to make him happy: This
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:025584_0282_0FCE05ADDC4E0860"/>
has induced her to relinquiſh her firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and to adopt every ſtratagem, that Laura may become the happy being.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Gibbins may have been handſome twenty or thirty years back, though at preſent no veſtige of beauty remains; and he is one of the moſt illiterate beings I ever heard attempt to ſpeak. But why do I mention theſe. <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>age</hi> are not to be conſidered, when contraſted with a <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi> and <hi>carriage.</hi> This gentleman differs, in many reſpects, from his ſex: For a lady to have rude health is ſo <hi>vulgar</hi> he cannot abide it. "There is a certain ſomething to be expreſſed to a ſick wife which ſuits the ſoftneſs of his diſpoſition; it gives an affectionate huſband an opportunity to ſhow his regards." A very pretty affection truly, that cannot be evinced, unleſs the beloved object is languiſhing in a conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or tortured with pain!</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Leaſon readily falls in with all his ideas. Her daughter is quite an invalid. She propoſes, her making a viſit to Potſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grove: The ride would be of ſervice to her health. This is artfully done before
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:025584_0283_0FCE05AF59BBA580"/>
Mr. Gibbins. He begs not to be deprived of Miſs Laura's company. Mrs. Leaſon is now highly gratified. She then makes an objection to her going with any of the young boarders; and ſhe cannot poſſibly accompany her. Mr. Gibbins requeſts the honour to attend her, and aſſures her mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, his chariot and himſelf are equally at Miſs Laura's command. I ſuſpect this will end in a connexion; but I am not, I aſſure you, envious of Laura's proſpects.</p>
                  <p>Fanny, your brother and myſelf, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently paſs an hour with your aunt P. I never quit her company without regret. More real pleaſure reſults from her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, than from all the circles of the city. I am delighted with her family government. Heaven has bleſt her with a number of children, who, from the cradle, are taught to obey. Indeed every part of her houſe appears to be directed by a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical hand, which moves the whole ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem in perfect uniſon. Mr. P. has added to his family ſeveral little orphans, who being left deſtitute of property or friends, induced this benevolent man to take them

into his houſe, theſe receive the ſame ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ucation with his own children. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives an inexpreſſible pleaſure from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence of his beneficent mind. While the ſelfiſh heart, waſtes its days, without ever wiping the tear of affliction from the furrowed cheek of poverty, few partake of the philanthropy of a P. or a Belmour. Was the world more generally governed by their principles, we ſhould experience a happineſs unknown to the preſent age. We ſhould not then find one brother com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to go into diſtant, and hazardous countries, where he muſt experience in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable hardſhips, while another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued at home, counting his property, and oppreſſing the diſtreſſed.</p>

                  <p>MY aunt was with me a few days ſince. "<hi>A new blow,</hi>" ſhe ſays, "<hi>is ſtruck at her domeſtic peace.</hi>" My uncle has been reflecting upon her for ſome of her late imprudencies, and ſhe, as uſual, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, returned a double ſhare of invective. She reſolves not to continue with him; but is undetermined what ſteps to purſue.</p>
                  <p>The connexion between Mr. Gibbins and Laura goes on rapidly. I have taken the liberty to make ſome obſervations to Mrs. Leaſon, reſpecting the age of her daughter's gallant. With theſe ſhe was much offended, and replied, "It was better to be an old man's darling, than a young man's ſlave. It is not probable" ſhe ſays, "that Mr. Gibbins will live a great while, and then what a fortune Laura will have! All

the young gentlemen in the city, will be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the rich widow." Since I find how it is, I ſhall be cautious that I do not again injure the feelings of my landlady.</p>
                  <p>In this inſtance, I am ſure, money muſt make good great deficiencies. But Mrs. Leaſon and Laura are not ſingular in their ideas. Strange infatuation! that for the proſpect of wealth, they give up every pleaſing expectation of connubial happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. What can a young lady flatter her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who, in the bloom of youth, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with a man in the laſt ſtage of life, that is either ſatiated with the follies and amuſements through which he has paſſed, or who is unable, by the decrepitude of age, to enjoy the gay ſcenes in which the heart of his wife conſtantly partakes. A uniformity of taſte, is an eſſential requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to domeſtic happineſs; and this can never be found in ſo ſtriking a contraſt of years. Would Laura and her mamma, anticipate what muſt take place a ſhort pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod hence, when the concomitant diſeaſes of advanced life, ſhall reduce her intended huſband to a ſecond childhood, they muſt,

                  <p>MRS. Leaſon is truly an artful woman. Her fineſſe alone will obtain a huſband for Laura. The old gentleman pays her the cloſeſt attention. She begs that I will not ſay any thing to diſcourage her daughter. I am perfectly ſick of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; although, when he is preſent, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help ſmiling.

                  <p>The pleaſure which the anticipation of this connexion affords Mrs. Leaſon, cannot be expreſſed. She has long been endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouring to make a match between her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and a certain young gentleman in this city, who has been ſome time her gallant; but notwithſtanding every opportunity ſhe had given him to encourage an infant par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality,

which ſhe flattered herſelf was kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in his breaſt; he has never made any declaration of his paſſion.</p>
                  <p>Upon the arrival of Mr. Gibbins, Mr. Hill was ſlighted, as he does not make ſo great a ſhow. His virtues and good qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities are obſcured; real accompliſhments are neglected, for imaginary ones. For my own part I have endeavoured to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover one pleaſing trait in the character of Laura's lover, but have not ſucceeded. He may be ſtyled one of thoſe beings, which the world denominates harmleſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenſive; terms, which in my view, deſignate the moſt contemptible character. It is at once to ſay they are unfit for enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, and deſtroys every idea annexed to the requiſite qualifications of either the active citizen, the ſoldier, or the real friend.

You remember the ſtory of Henri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etta Careleſs, who was ſuddenly miſſing, and was long ſince, ſuppoſed to be dead. Her friends laſt week received a letter from her, which gives the following account.</p>
                  <p>"Having for ſome time, encouraged an attachment to a certain French gentleman, who had reſided ſeveral years in Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, ſhe reſolved to follow him to his native country; and underſtanding that a French family, who ſailed ſoon after him, wiſhed a perſon to attend them upon their paſſage, and take the care of their children; having ſuitably clothed herſelf for the purpoſe, ſhe made application to them, and engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their ſervice.</p>
                  <p>"Soon after their arrival in France, Monſieur De Lot made a viſit to the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in which ſhe was, to congratulate them upon their return. Having been intimate with this gentleman in America, ſhe feared he might recal her countenance; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing engaged in accompliſhing a piece of needle work for the lady with whom ſhe lived, ſhe endeavoured to command her
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:025584_0292_0FCE05BE5F47EB58"/>
feelings; and learning by their converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he accuſtomed himſelf to walk ſome time after dinner, in the celebrated gardens of Mr. M. an American gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſhe reſolved the next day to deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate herſelf in a particular dreſs, which had been much admired by him, while in Philadelphia, and to walk in the gardens, about the time ſhe expected he would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear there. She had not been long amuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herſelf in this delightful ſpot, before ſhe ſaw him enter, and ſoon found ſhe had caught his attention.</p>
                  <p>"Having followed her ſome way, he haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened his ſtep; and overtaking her, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed great joy from the unexpected meeting, welcomed her to Paris, and begged to know what had brought her from home? She replied, the circumſtances of her voyage were ſingular, and at preſent could not be divulged. "You will, however," ſaid he, "permit me to viſit you, and attend you in public!" She aſſured him it was not in her power, at preſent, to gratify a wiſh, in which her heart ſo largely ſhared. "You muſt indulge me," ſaid he, "in viſiting
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:025584_0293_0FCE05C1A3BDE700"/>
you." She aſſured him, that could not yet be granted. "Your ſtory muſt indeed be ſingular," ſaid he, "which induces you thus to ſeclude yourſelf from the ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of one, who has long felt his heart glow, with a partiality he cannot conquer. Nothing, my adored Henrietta," continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he, "but an engagement I had, previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to my viſiting America, bound myſelf by every tie of honour, to fulfil, would have torn me from you. Conſider me as your protector. Since my return, I feel myſelf leſs obliged to purſue an object, whoſe conduct in my abſence, has render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her diſguſtful to me. The three years I paſſed in America, have changed my opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion with reſpect to the education of my own country women. I have entirely loſt my attachment to that volatile conduct, which in my view borders upon a criminal levity; and I am reſolved to obtain an American wife. This declaration determ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined her to keep inviolate her ſtory; and as ſhe could not ſee him, while ſhe remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in her preſent capacity at Madam —'s, ſhe begged he would excuſe her being ſeen
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:025584_0294_0FCE05C2D987E768"/>
by him for a few days; and inſiſted that he ſhould not attend her from the place where they then were. She did not, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, leave him, without a promiſe of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in the ſame garden in a few days. Being repeatedly ſeen together, various conjectures were excited; and in a ſhort time it was known, that the American girl who lived with Madam —, was the perſon who met Monſieur De Lot. The lady with whom ſhe lived, unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately was connected in the family with which this gentleman had long expected a union; ſhe therefore thought it beſt to quit her houſe, and retire to private, but reputable lodgings, where ſhe frequently received the viſits of her lover. Thus they paſſed ſeveral months; when the day was fixed for the wedding, and the next week, ſhe was to have been introduced to his connexions; but having taken his leave of Henrietta one night, later than uſual, ſhe never ſaw nor heard of him more. Notwithſtanding the indefatigable exertions of his friends to recover him, and having paſſed a year in fruitleſs inquiries,
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:025584_0295_0FCE05C45ABD5258"/>
ſhe finally reſolved to retire to a monaſtery, where ſhe has taken the veil, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines to end her days in a voluntary exile, as buſy life is without enchantments to her. Her brother is preparing to ſail in the pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et for France; if poſſible, to prevail upon her to return to the embraces of her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient parents. Your former intimacy with Henrietta, and the converſation it has afforded in Philadelphia, will be an ample apology for my relating it to you. May Caroline largely ſhare in the affections of Maria.</p>

                  <p>A LARGE packet has been hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me from the Weſtward. It contained letters from my friends Evremont and Clark. That you may have ſome idea of their ſituation, I ſhall encloſe Captain Clark's letter for your peruſal. Since the receipt of theſe, I am doubly diſtreſſed; and the preſent appearance of nature, is perfectly conſonant to the gloomy feelings of my heart. The waſte and deſolation now before me increaſes my ſable thoughts. Winter is ſpreading round us her ſerious attire; but although perſonally ſecured againſt the howl of the tempeſt, and the gripe of the froſt, I cannot be inſenſible to the ſufferings of my diſtant friends.

                           <p>A LETTER, which I have this day received from my friend Caroline, affords me moſt ſenſible pleaſure. It calls my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agination to the peaceful ſcenes of domeſtic life. My fancy preſents my friends in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

points of view<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and leads my mind to the variegated purſuits in which they are engaged: That they may ever be promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of their beſt intereſt and happineſs, is the warmeſt wiſh of my heart. As my preſent ſituation may prevent my writing more than a few lines at a time, my letter may bear more the appearance of a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal than an epiſtle. I ſhall, however, avail myſelf of every opportunity, to give you ſome account of our ſituation.</p>
                           <p>I left Pittſburg on Monday, Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the fifth, in company with three other boats commanded by Captain Evremont, Captain Gardner, and Lieutenant G. Nothing material occurred on our paſſage to Muſkingum, except my diſcovering, by an excellent glaſs I had in the boat, men on ſhore, about two miles a-head, filing off through the buſhes, as I ſuppoſed, to attack us. We prepared to receive them, and kept our lads at their arms, until we arrived at Muſkingum, which was the ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enth of September. We paid the compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the drum, and received a ſalute from the block-houſe here. At this place
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:025584_0299_0FCE05CC996C4918"/>
I met many of my old acquaintance, who were happy to ſee me. I was delighted with the ſituation of Marietta, but think the "<hi>Campus Martius,</hi>" derives its princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal excellency from its ſtrength againſt an Indian, rather than a military enemy. We took our leave of this in a few hours, accompanied by a number of gentlemen who were bound to Belle Pre, and who were ſo polite as to attend us twenty-five miles beyond that place. I think they paid dear for their gratification, as they had to row back againſt a current, which now runs about four and a half knots an hour.</p>
                           <p>When we came oppoſite the French ſettlement of Galliopolis, I was ſo ſick, that I was obliged to ſend a letter aſhore to Captain G. to apologize for my not viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iting him with my brother officers. The ninth, a large bear ſwam acroſs the river. One of my men jumped into a canoe, but bruin reached the ſhore before him, and made off. This was the firſt large ſpecies of game I have ſeen, during my march to Pittſburg, or ſail thus far down the river,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:025584_0300_0FCE05CE17AC12E8"/>
except one fawn. The tenth, landed at the famous ſettlement of Limeſtone. To ſay I was diſappointed, would give but a ſmall idea of the place, or my feelings. It is true, the land about it is luxuriantly fertile, and the town is happily ſituated; but the houſes, for ſo old a ſettlement, are contemptibly mean and badly built. Moſt of the people are poor and lazy, and the ſtreets abominably filthy and dirty; owing to their hogſties being contiguous to them; and from lazineſs, or ſome reaſon incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible to me, their ſuffering the filth and excrements to run into the ſtreets. Limeſtone is ſixty miles from Fort-Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</p>
                           <p>The next place we landed at, was a ſettlement called Little Miami. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a beautiful ſituation, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple appear contented and induſtrious. Having reached Fort-Waſhington, waited upon General St. Clair. The twelfth, dined with General Harmer; were order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to hold ourſelves in readineſs to march at the ſhorteſt notice. Thurſday, September the fifteenth, ordered to march
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:025584_0301_0FCE05D110C83808"/>
for head-quarters, which is twenty-four miles from Fort-Waſhington. Forded two deep creeks during the march; halted at Mill-Creek, ten miles from Fort-Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington; the road ſo very muddy our bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage could not keep up with us; of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence we were obliged to lay in the woods on a wet piece of ground, without a blanket or great coat, with only thin nankeen over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls, and a linen jacket. I confeſs I was moſt uncomfortably cold, although I lay with my feet to a good fire. The fog was ſo thick as to wet my clothes through. About twelve at night, a large tree, fell upon two of the ſoldiers, one of whom died in a ſhort time; the other was badly wounded. The ſixteenth, we were impeded in our march, by reaſon of the ſurveyors not having <hi>blazed</hi>

The riflemen were
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:025584_0302_0FCE05D1D9C7A7B8"/>
now ſent to reconnoitre, and make a new road into the old one, which was diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered three miles from where we were. Our baggage now came up, and we got ſomething to eat and drink; it being the firſt time ſince the day before. "It is tight times with us, I aſſure you."</p>
                           <p>The ſeventeenth reached the great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ami. The eighteenth, General St. Clair arrived from Fort-Waſhington. The nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, ſeveral large rattle-ſnakes were kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our men in camp.</p>
                           <p>I cannot account for the mode in which duty is generally done in this camp; for I conceive it <hi>abſolutely unmilitary:</hi> But as older officers than myſelf have done the ſame tournament in the game, I acquieſce, though I think it a ridiculous mode; but hope the ſtyle will be altered, when we move towards the enemy, who, we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, are fifteen hundred ſtrong, and are determined to give us battle. So be it: Although I am ſorry our force is not ſo reſpectable in point of ſtrength as num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. This day, immediately upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off my duty, I was ordered to make
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:025584_0303_0FCE05D3591DCB58"/>
out a muſter-roll, and an inſpection-return, againſt to-morrow!</p>
                           <p>Conſideration is one of the firſt prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erties in my eſtimation of a good General; but to put an officer upon duty, and, as ſoon as he comes off, to expect three days buſineſs, with cloſe application<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in one, is a refinement beyond my comprehenſion! However, what can be, ſhall be done.</p>
                           <p>Major H. returned yeſterday from Fort-Waſhington, but with ſmall encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement, as to our baggage being forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This is againſt me, as all my ſtores were left there, and the difficulty of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them ſent to me, naturally increaſes with my diſtance from them; however, it is nothing uncommon to ſoldiers, and I muſt and will be contented. This afternoon my boy returned to me from the hoſpital at Fort-Waſhington. Poor boy! the ſcenes are ſo novel, and, as he conceives, hard, that it affects his ſpirits, and makes him unhappy. He little thinks what fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues and dangers are yet to come! In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, my friend, I anticipate a winter's
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:025584_0304_0FCE05D65267FD88"/>
campaign, in a country inhabited only by wild beaſts, or the ſtill more ferocious bipeds of the foreſt, without baggage, and I very much fear, in a manner without proviſions; as it is clear to my underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the froſt will deſtroy the herbage of the country, which is the ſole depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, at preſent, of our bat-horſes and cattle! This anticipation, with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection of having no other coverings in our <hi>beſt</hi> ſituation, but our tents, in the middle of winter; and that when on pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, we ſhall be allowed no fire, however ſtormy or cold it may be, I confeſs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords me but little ſatisfaction in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation.</p>
                           <p>The continual rains in this country muſt render it very unhealthy. We have but few dry nights. My tent, bed and clothes are always wet. Frequently do we beſtow a <hi>benediction</hi> upon the contractors, for the thinneſs of our tents; the backs and doors of which are made of the coarſeſt oznabrigs, through which it rains as thro' a ſieve; thus is the country cheated, and the ſoldier impoſed upon.</p>

I ſhall forward this to Fort-Waſhington by Captain Green, who is ordered with fifty men to that place, in order to eſcort bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage to camp; from thence, I have no doubt it will be forwarded with the firſt diſpatches to Philadelphia.

                  <p>THE tribute of my dear Maria, and her god-mother's benevolence, are duly received. Accept my thanks in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of Mrs. Gardner. I ſhall, by an early opportunity, tranſmit this token of your ſympathy to her; and feel aſſured, it will be received with a grateful heart. By letters lately from her, we learn, that by the ſeverity of Mr. Gardner, ſeveral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable planters in the neighbourhood of Havre-de-Grace, have been reduced to very great diſtreſs. The ſituation of one of theſe unfortunate perſons, is indeed afflicting.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Gardner had long expreſſed a particular friendſhip for a Mr. Henſhaw; he availed himſelf of thoſe profeſſions, and hired of him a ſum of money, for which
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:025584_0307_0FCE05DB4CDA4C68"/>
he gave a mortgage of his plantation as a ſecurity. This property, united with the ſtock he previouſly owned, enabled him to commence a large ſpeculator; but finally proving unfortunate, and being followed with repeated bad contracts, he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thouſands worſe than nothing. Mr. Gardner had loaned him the money upon an extravagant intereſt, but had given him his honour that he would never diſtreſs either him or his family for it; nor never ſuffer them to be turned off from their eſtate. But theſe promiſes were made to a man in affluence, and were never meant to be extended beyond the period of proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity. Notwithſtanding Mr. Henſhaw had received but one half the value of his place, which has ſince been appriſed by indifferent people; the other half was ſhortly ſwallowed up by the uſurious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt which Mr. Gardner demanded; and this unfortunate man, who has an aged father and mother, beſides an extenſive family dependant upon him, is thrown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the bounty of his neighbours for a preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſubſiſtence. This, my dear Maria, is
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:025584_0308_0FCE05DC8A3D6DF0"/>
one among the unnumbered inſtances of his barbarity. An amiable, a happy family are at this moment experiencing his inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable cruelty; his ſurpriſing parſimony and uſury; and while they view him as the great cauſe of their diſtreſs, are loading him with their ſevereſt reproaches. But though the heart of a Gardner is hardened, and his ears deaf to their diſtreſs, yet he who reigns above, and views with a juſt abhorrence, his inhuman conduct, will fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſhower down his vengeance upon the perpetrator of ſo cruel a deed. Then will he, who now <hi>thrives</hi> by <hi>oppreſſion,</hi> and who views the diſtreſs of a <hi>brother</hi> and a <hi>friend,</hi> with a heart hardened by a love of wealth, experience that ſevere remorſe of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which he has kindled by a rapacious mind. Then will the anger of an offended Deity roll upon him, and in his moments of anguiſh he will regret the calamities he has brought upon others. It is the voice of heaven which denounceth woe unto them who heap up wealth in abundance, grinding the face of the poor, conſidering not the ſweat of their brow; but who are rejoicing alone in their poſſeſſions.</p>

                  <p>A FEW evenings ſince, the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant acquainted me that a perſon at the door wiſhed to ſpeak with me. I aroſe from my chair, and was paſſing into the entry, when Mrs. Leaſon bid the boy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire them to walk into the parlour and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver their meſſage; but not having any idea of danger, I endeavoured to paſs her; when ſhe caught my hand, and led me back into the room. The boy ſoon returned with a card, which gave me an invitation to paſs the next evening with your aunt P. Without heſitation I returned my compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and aſſurances of attending her. When your brother came home, I told him my engagement, and claimed the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of his company. The next day prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtormy; but not inclining to be depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:025584_0310_0FCE05E072AD4440"/>
of ſociety to which I am ſtrongly attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, your brother procured a carriage and attended me to his aunt's. From the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular invitation I had received, I expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to find a ſelect party aſſembled; but upon my entering the room, diſcovered we were unexpected, though welcome viſitors. This induced me to apologize for being out ſo diſagreeable an evening; and I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured her, my partiality to her company, as well as real politeneſs, which obliged me to fulfil particular engagements, had alone induced my preſent viſit. "It is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly," replied ſhe, "an agreeable diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for I anticipated paſſing this even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alone, as Mr. P. left the city yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday, and will not return this week; I ſhall therefore claim you as my companion until he arrives. I now began to ſuſpect the card a deception; and taking out my pocket-book, handed it to her, requeſting to know if that was her invitation. She aſſured me it was not. This confirmed my imagination, and has again filled me with fears. Watched by ſo inflexible an enemy as Eliza, my conduct, muſt indeed
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:025584_0311_0FCE05E1A0B24128"/>
be guarded; ſo great is her art, I cannot develope her in a ſingle inſtance; although it is evident, ſhe leaves no ſtratagem uneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayed to complete my deſtruction. Thoſe reflections, however, which reſult from a recognition of my conduct, greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to my happineſs. To theſe I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire with a ſatisfaction, of which I can never be deprived by the ſevereſt perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they will contribute to my ſupport. An invariable attachment to virtue, and a ſtrict adherence to duty, will, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the misfortunes we meet, facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the journey of life. Self-approbation, greatly contributes to our enjoyment; nor can we be deprived of a tranquil and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py mind, while we reverence the dictates of conſcience. <hi>Do as thou would be done unto,</hi> is a precept which ſhould early be impreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the heart; and they, whoſe actions coincide with this copy will enſure a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent reward. While I continued at Mrs. P's. a billet was handed me from my aunt Noble, which was written, as ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes, <hi>from her bed of ſickneſs and diſtreſs.</hi> This begged my immediate attendance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:025584_0312_0FCE05E318CD0790"/>
her: But being convinced it was noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more than a return of her old diſorder, I felt no inclination to hurry myſelf; and accordingly deferred my viſit until the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon; when going to the houſe, I found her below, and at her favourite amuſement, cards. This was, however, a matter of no ſurpriſe to me, for I had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently known her while at Trenton, to keep her bed, ſend for her miniſter and doctor, and in leſs than an hour after they had left her, come down ſtairs, apparently in her uſual health, and devote the whole day to the card-table. She pleads in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for this indulgence, her indiſpoſition and difficulties; and to ſmooth the brow of a gloomy imagination, plunges deep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to error; nor does ſhe ever enjoy herſelf but in ceaſing to be reaſonable; for ſuch thoſe ſurely are, who can never be happy but when thus employed. The Deity has, undoubtedly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> deſigned us mutually to contribute to the happineſs of each other; and the love of ſociety is ſtrongly imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon our hearts. It is a tie, which properly enjoyed, leads to the moſt refined

pleaſures. By this ſocial intercourſe, our ideas become enlarged, the torch of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is lighted, and we derive a gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſuperior to every idle amuſement. But that mind muſt indeed be peculiarly vacant, which can never be at eaſe, unleſs engaged in ſcenes of diſſipation; we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſome moments for reflection which we cannot enjoy in a round of company.</p>

                  <p>THE anxiety I experience for my friends, prevents me from partaking in that current of happineſs, which is now overflowing the ambitious imagination of Mrs. Leaſon and Laura, from the antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated connexion with Mr. Gibbins. Yet notwithſtanding my painful ſenſations, I am obliged to decorate my expreſſions in the livery of gaiety, to diſſemble my feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings however difficult the undertaking. Deception in this reſpect, is a double duty which I owe to the friendſhip and health of Fanny; but it is impoſſible always to conceal my feelings, and ſhe frequently diſcovers the uneaſineſs of my heart. Her ſolicitous friendſhip, adds a jewel to her virtues, and reflects redoubled luſtre upon her actions. I keep, as far as poſſible, ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery painful event from her knowledge, and

the frequent letters ſhe receives from her lover and brother, are alſo written in a ſtyle of gaiety. There being an eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed poſt, from this place to Pittſburg, we often have an opportunity of hearing from our friends, though ſeveral weeks have elapſed ſince we received any information. This cauſes the moſt diſtreſſing ideas to haunt my imagination. Forgive me, Maria, if I indulge a gloomy propenſity. Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which we rather encourage than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, are quick in their growth.</p>

                           <p>YOUR laſt letter, while it evinces your friendſhip, I confeſs gives me pain, by the diſcovery of your anxiety. You muſt not ſuffer the ſituation of a ſoldier to impede your happineſs. Captain Green, upon his return from Fort-Waſhington, told me he had given our letters to a diſpatch which left that ſort for Pittſburg; from thence they will be immediately forwarded to Philadelphia, by my friend Mr. T. I wiſh this letter could picture to you a more agreeable proſpect than my laſt; but my anticipation in that, reſpecting the pea vine, our principal dependence for the ſupport of our horſes, &amp;c. and all the herbage of the country, except long ſour graſs, and decayed leaves, is now cut off: The horſes are enfeebled and die daily; we had only a few bags of flour on hand for the ſupport of the whole army, until the arrival of the brigade of ſixty horſes, with which Captain S. came; and they only brought
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:025584_0318_0FCE05EDA0164B60"/>
three days proviſion. On the road they met a brigade of horſes, which left us three days ago; but the badneſs of the road rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered ſtill worſe by the heavy rains, had worn the horſes down, and diſcouraged the pack-horſe maſters, who, Captain S. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms, ſwear they will not return!</p>
                           <p>Our ſituation in a few days will be critically diſtreſſing, if Mr. D's agents have no other dependence for the tranſportation of proviſion to us than the preſent ſet of horſes belonging to the army. Heaven knows the poor creatures cannot bear but little, if any burden; and a few days or weeks, will finiſh the campaign with moſt of them.</p>
                           <p>The Indians have taken fifty-ſix horſes from Ludlow-Station, the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore laſt. This place is between Fort-Waſhington and our camp. It ſeems to be their adopted policy to capture our horſes; and is, beyond a doubt, the moſt effectual mode of preventing the expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the Miami towns, as our army cannot move without horſes to tranſport their neceſſary proviſions and ſtores. The

                           <p>SINCE I wrote the above, we have marched, cutting the road as we went, ſome days more, others leſs, undergoing cold, fatigue, and hunger; for our ratios are now reduced, until a further ſupply ſhall arrive. This has occaſioned ſixty of the Kentucky militia to leave us, and the remainder ſwear they will not ſtay, unleſs they are allowed their uſual proviſions.

                  <p>MY laſt letter from the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, if poſſible, has added to my depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Calypſo, you know, was inconſolable for the loſs of Ulyſſes, and all the beauties around her only heightened her diſtreſs. Thus it is with Caroline. Fanny, although poſſeſſing a greater command of her feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings than myſelf, ſuffers inexpreſſibly by her fears. I have at preſent, little reliſh for ſociety; but my wiſh to amuſe my drooping friend, forces me from home.</p>
                  <p>A few days ſince, we fell in company with ſeveral of thoſe very polite young gentlemen, who rather than give others the trouble to talk, engroſs the converſation themſelves. I dare ſay you frequently meet with thoſe coxcombs, whom nature has rendered vain, by beſtowing upon
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:025584_0322_0FCE05F4575DFAB8"/>
them a likely face. Intoxicated by their perſonal charms, they view, with contempt, the ſentimental and improved companion. Theſe ſimple pretty fellows, are, in their own opinions, accompliſhed characters. Having acquired a few compliments, and plundered the dictionary for the moſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured expreſſions, they arrange them into unintelligible ſentences, to which they affix a few oaths, as an additional elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to their diſcourſe, imagining them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves equal to the moſt celebrated philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers; they ſoar into the ethereal ſpace for their expreſſions, and leave a common underſtanding, at a loſs for their ideas.</p>
                  <p>I ſoon took my leave of this company. The cheerful fire ſide of Mrs. Leaſon, is far preferable to the converſation of ſuch triflers. Viſiting is deſigned as a relaxation to the mind; and we ſeek entertainment abroad, that we may indulge thoſe ſocial feelings, inherent in our nature. Agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſociety mutually improves the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; but the vague prattle of the cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb, can never enlarge the ideas. Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is ſaid to be peculiar to our ſex. Is not
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:025584_0323_0FCE05F6A4DC95A0"/>
this a ſentiment born of prejudice, and nurſed by a partial imagination? Vanity is invariably the companion of an empty mind; and an intercourſe with the world certainly exhibits as many vacant heads in one ſex as in the other; nor is beauty leſs deſtructive to the underſtanding of the gentlemen, than of the ladies.</p>

                  <p>WILL you believe me, Maria, the bearer of your laſt letter, Mr. Trevers, pretends to a violent paſſion for your friend. Let not this information impreſs you with an idea of my being vain. I am ſenſible we often miſtake attention for love; but if the moſt languiſhing expreſſion of the eye, the moſt paſſionate language of the tongue, and the moſt aſſiduous conduct, denote affection, the youth feels the pang. It ſeems, Maria, you have been ſaying many civil things of your friend, and he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges he meets me preattached. Why did you not alſo tell him of my engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? but even this, I apprehend, would not have diſcouraged him; for I find he is ſo much in love with himſelf, that he will not eaſily be brought to believe, any can be indifferent to his charms.</p>

Notwithſtanding he has knocked his head againſt the walls of a college, and taken the <hi>tour</hi> of the <hi>States,</hi> he has not acquired ſufficient underſtanding to render himſelf agreeable; nor would all his property, for he tells me he is "Heir to a great eſtate," compenſate for the vacuum in his brain. In company he has a trick of playing, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly, with the chain of his watch; to render more obvious, I conclude, many expenſive trinkets annexed to it.</p>
                  <p>I aſked him, a few days ſince, if he was fond of reading, and offered to lend him ſome entertaining authors, in hopes of loſing a few of his morning viſits; but in his great gallantry, he replied, at the ſame moment ſqueezing my hand with the moſt imaginable fondneſs, that "My company was vaſtly to be prefered to ſo inſipid an employment;" and that four years hard ſtudy at college, had ſickened

                  <p>AN accident, yeſterday, brought me into the company of Eliza. I had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to accompany a little party to a tea-houſe, ſeven miles from town. When we alighted we were told the houſe was croud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but that a party who had dined there, were preparing to return; and that this room ſhould be reſerved for us, if we would for the preſent ſtep into a ſmall one adjoining it. This room was a paſſage to that in which the company was. We had not been long ſeated, before ſeveral gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and ladies paſſed through it, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acquainted with our party, inſiſted we ſhould join them. To this they cheerfully agreed. Our addition to their ſociety giving them new ſpirits, they propoſed to paſs the evening and have a dance. I had been with this company but a ſhort time,
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:025584_0328_0FCE05FC55DE7708"/>
before Eliza, with two other ladies, entered the room. I reſolved, however, not to render the evening painful to my friends; but, as they had made the excurſion for pleaſure, to ſuppreſs feelings which invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untarily occur, when I conſider her as the cauſe of my wretchedneſs.</p>
                  <p>In the party in which I was, I felt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure from her malice, whatever the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of her heart might ſuggeſt. Muſic was accordingly procured, and your friend, Mr. Trevers, ſolicited me to engage myſelf as his partner for the evening; but having uniformly diſcouraged his attachment to me, I refuſed to comply with his requeſt, by pleading a previous engagement. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately he obtained Eliza for his part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and was placed the next couple to me. This gave him frequent opportunities of diſcovering his gallantry, which induced him to ſay many ſoft things to your friend. Theſe I would fain have conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as unmeaning ſentences often repeated to us without deſign to make impreſſion upon the mind; but ſo much did I engage his attention, that he was deficient in his
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:025584_0329_0FCE05FD68506B58"/>
politeneſs to Eliza, and frequently repeated to her the paſſion he experienced for me.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Helen, the gentleman with whom I had the happineſs to dance, was in his perſon elegant, in his manners accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, while virtue appeared to elevate his mind and invigorate his imagination; and the evening paſſed in the indulgence of that innocent gaiety which delineates the features of youth. I could not, however, feel that tranquillity I ſhould have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced had Eliza been abſent. Fanny's health did not permit her attending us: Her indiſpoſition deprives her of many gratifications; but ſhe ſhines in the hours of ſickneſs, and has a diſpoſition ſweetly ſubmiſſive to the will of heaven. When Hygeia ſhall forſake my cheek, and the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid meſſenger of incurable diſeaſe denounce the irrevocable decree, may I feel that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation which is ſo ſtriking in my friend.</p>

                  <p>IT is in vain. I find I cannot get rid of my love-ſick Damon; he is the moſt perſevering lad I ever knew. I imagine he flatters himſelf, that if he could obtain my hand, my heart would ſoon follow; but love muſt be free. The affections cannot be forced. Perhaps he is indifferent to the acquiſition of the heart, and is only ſolicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for the perſon of your friend. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he thinks, that the ſervice of plate, which he has taken peculiar care to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint me he has making in this city, and for which he even wiſhes my taſte, with the elegant houſe his father is now building, together with a ſuperb carriage which is is nearly completed, will finally tempt your friend. But I am reſolved not to ſacrifice my happineſs to pride. All theſe things have their influence, I ſhall have

no objection to ſhining in an elevated ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation with the man I love, nor of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riencing a few wants with him who ſhares my ſincere affections. Are theſe ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments worthy of Caroline?</p>
                  <p>Mr. Helen has politely called upon me. He increaſes upon an acquaintance. I dare not ſay half I really think, of this charming young man.

His under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding I eſteem, and his ſentiments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect an honour upon his education. Time glides imperceptibly in his ſociety.

                        <p>From this moment I relinquiſh the flattering idea of a connexion, which, in imagination, has produced ſuch ſcenes of future happineſs. Your duplicity evinces you unworthy my affection; and although it is hard to diveſt myſelf of feelings I have long encouraged, I am reſolved to take the final leave of an object unworthy of my heart. In this determination, I feel the ſtruggle of a ſincere affection. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctantly purſue a conduct, which nothing but the indubitable proof of your deceit, could induce me to adopt. My very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular friend, Mr. L. who was lately upon a party with you, and witneſſed your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,

and the attention you then receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from your rival lovers, has given me the information. Had it not come from him, I ſhould have ſuſpected the truth; I ſhould not have believed you capable of trifling with a man, who has thus uniformly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated his attachment. I will not, however, look back to fancied felicity, to encounter my preſent feelings; it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſuppreſs every recollection of the paſt. You have long ſince been convinced, that it was not a mere ſentiment of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which actuated my boſom, but an affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion refined and elevated by that ſhow of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue which I flattered myſelf you really poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and which my partiality prevented me from diſcovering was, the vague drapery of an unworthy mind.

The melancholy accounts from the weſtern army have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved me in unutterable diſtreſs. While nouriſhing the pleaſurable anticipation of a reconciliation with Captain Evremont, I was unmindful of the dangers to which he was expoſed, and totally unprepared for the diſtreſſing event. The object upon which I fondly placed my expectation of future happineſs, to whom I looked for protection and advice, is far removed from me. Inſupportable idea! He has left the world alienated from Caroline. I cannot liſp, but in the moſt feeble accents, the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs I feel. Can my exhauſted nature ſuſtain ſo ſevere a ſtroke! My eyes are dim with ſorrow; a univerſal langour is
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:025584_0346_0FCE061A97209BC8"/>
diffuſed throughout my frame. The tear which often relieves the troubled mind, is congealed; the pearly drop is petrified. I am inadequate to the offices of friendſhip.

                  <p>MY diſtreſs muſt apologize for the neglect, in my laſt, in not participating with you in behalf of your couſin, whoſe name, I am told, is upon the liſt of the wounded. My hand trembles while I write—my mind ſhudders when I recal the diſtreſſing ſcene—every pleaſing expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is inactive—my ſituation is, beyond idea, wretched—all hope is fled. Had I been deprived of Captain Evremont, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to the late fatal conduct of Eliza, I ſhould have had a conſolation to which I am now a ſtranger. To ſuffer in the eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of thoſe we love is diſtracting to our reflections, and increaſes the wounds of the heart. Your couſin is, I find, left to regret the loſs of his particular friend, General Hill. This defeat alike involves the affectionate parent—the wiſe beloved,
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:025584_0348_0FCE061F1991CE90"/>
and the amiable ſiſter in the moſt compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated diſtreſs. The throb of anguiſh, now tears the parental breaſt—many of whom are mourning for an only child. The moſt torturing ideas will corrode the happineſs of diſconſolate widows; while ſiſters and friends, juſtly partial to the merits of the deceaſed, will mingle the tears of affection and ſorrow. The delicate ſituation of Fanny's health, if poſſible, adds to my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs upon this melancholy occaſion.</p>

He obſerves, there are no reflections to imbitter the recollection of Captain Evremont, as he died like a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, and was, he flatters himſelf, inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tranſlated to the realms of bliſs. It af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords peculiar ſatisfaction, that he was not left upon the field of battle to encounter the laſt pangs of diſſolution, with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional ſufferings of ſavage torture, but that he received a ſudden tranſlation from earth to heaven. Theſe reflections pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent many diſtreſſing ideas, which would reſult from an apprehenſion of his having been left without a friend, expoſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult, cruelty and diſtreſs.

                  <p>CONVINCED that Maria will be a participant with me, and that the plaintive voice of unfeigned ſorrow, will deeply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt your heart, I have frequent recourſe to my pen. It is a luxury thus to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſom my affliction.</p>
                  <p>What adverſe ſtorms await me! What unnumbered accidents mar our felicity!

hope! what a ſweet ingredient art thou in the cup of life! Your couſin's letter to Fanny mentions, that Captain Green, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcovered the moſt undaunted brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, received a wound in his hip, which rendered him unable to ſtand; and as no attention was paid to the wounded veterans, he was left, when the army retreated, with many unfortunate deſerving men, ſitting upon the way-ſide, encouraging them in their retreat.</p>
                  <p>My friend, Captain Clark, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he had been engaged through the whole battle, in the early part of which he received a wound in his ancle, was ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully left to cover the retreat of the flying army.

                  <p>RECEIVE, my dear Maria, my ſincere and grateful acknowledgments, for that warm participation, you ſo feelingly expreſs, in your laſt letter, for myſelf and Fanny. The preſent painful event, has indeed involved us in real afflictions.</p>
                  <p>Though the loſs of friends is ever pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the feeling and ſympathetic, there are circumſtances which mitigate theſe una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable afflictions, and certainly it is no inconſiderable one, to be allowed, by heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, to contribute, though but in the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree, to the comfort of their depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moments, to receive their laſt injunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to pay the reſpect due to their memory. But theſe pleaſing, painful grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ifications are denied upon the preſent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting occaſion, and the bodies thus dear
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:025584_0356_0FCE062E18AB9CE0"/>
to the recollection of congenial friends, are not only fallen a ſacrifice in a diſtant country, but have become the plunder of the ſavage tribes, from whom we cannot expect leſs than barbarity and abuſe. Could I ſelect the melancholy remains of thoſe departed heroes, and depoſit them in one friendly vault, then would I indulge the luxury which would reſult from moiſtening the ſacred ſod, and guarding it againſt the rude feet of diſreſpectful intruders. But, alas! every friendly office is denied; and were it not for the fragrant reflection, which alone perfumes the gloomy mind, that the ſoul, that ſuperiour and immortal part, is fled, far beyond the former confines of its ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary priſon, and is beyond the reach of mortal reſentment, we ſhould be encircled with an impenetrable night, and pierced with ſuch additional arrows, as would convey incurable poiſons, contaminate ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery enjoyment, and canker every ſocial pleaſure. But this idea, illumes the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal hemiſphere; it leſſens the affliction.</p>
                  <p>There is, indeed, an additional ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that although by a lively fancy we
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:025584_0357_0FCE062F978D1D20"/>
can picture their diſtreſs, yet the truth, if correſponding with thoſe piercing images of our afflicted mind, is, with us, a matter of uncertainty; and the real ſufferings which they have undergone, are concealed from our view.</p>
                  <p>Moſt ſenſibly do I feel the preſent ſtroke. Yes, Maria, it will not look to you, who have ſo often heard my ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of my friends while living, as afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion decorated in the language of unmean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flattery, but as the genuine ſprouts of a real regard, which have grown ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous in the warm boſom of friendſhip.</p>
                  <p>Since the firſt moment of my acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with Captain Evremont, I have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged myſelf his friend. My par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality may poſſibly magnify his merits; but I am confident I give him no more than his due, when I ſay, few poſſeſſed minds better formed, or ſentiments more ſtrictly conſonant with integrity, bravery, and honour. In private life, he was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly diſtinguiſhed, by thoſe virtues which form the baſis of a real friend; and as his ideas were delicate and refined, I
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:025584_0358_0FCE0631D7120950"/>
was ever happy to receive his approbation of my ſentiments, valuing it as the evidence of their worth. As a ſoldier, I can add no encomiums: Public fame echoes from every quarter his praiſe; and the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, upon which will be enrolled the names of many brave and valiant, will evince to future ages, the obligations of their country, and the general regret, which the unhappy event produced.</p>
                  <p>Fanny's indiſpoſition has increaſed, ſince the unfortunate accounts of the weſtern army: May heaven give her ſtrength to ſuſtain the preſent affliction; for without the interpoſition of an over-ruling Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, many ſurviving friends muſt ſink beneath this diſtreſſing event.</p>

                  <p>A late military commander, has arrived in this city. No ſumptuous cavalcade eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corted him hither; no applauſe and glory echoed forth his bravery; no honourary torch is lighted to denote his praiſe, nor is he received with acclamations of joy.

                  <p>EVERY thing is preparing for the marriage of Laura. They are to leave this city for Carolina, a few days after the ceremony is performed. Mrs. Leaſon has agreed to reſign her houſe, here, and paſs the next ſummer with her daughter. They are indeed quite elated with their preſent proſpects. I ſincerely wiſh they may not be diſappointed; but Mr. Gibbins is an entire ſtranger in this city, nor have they informed themſelves of his real ſituation or character.

Cheerfulneſs is often expreſſed in the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, while anxiety corrodes the heart. But the conduct of our landlady and her daughter, ſpeaks a language contrary to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. It expreſsly declares they have nothing to fear from a connexion with a man of money. It will enable Laura to indulge her fanciful diſpoſition, to orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment her perſon, and conſult her looking-glaſs; to command a carriage, and to be gratified by an external parade. Theſe are the ſummit of her wiſhes.

                  <p>FEW, my dear Maria, have been called, ſo early in life, to experience ſuch ſevere misfortunes as your Caroline. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of my parents, before I was capable of knowing my loſs; left a deſtitute orphan dependent upon the benevolence of a few connexions; in early life, habituated to ſeverity, and greatly neglected in my edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, until I happily fell into the hands of my uncle Franklin, of whom Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſhortly ſaw ſit to deprive me, though not to reduce me to former dependence, and to add to the catalogue of my ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Eliza has been permitted to perſecute and cruelly to injure me. Her perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have involved my particular friends in inſupportable diſtreſs, and finally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived me of my much loved Lucretia,
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:025584_0371_0FCE0647AAC8B2A0"/>
whoſe death conſigned to the ſilent tomb, a father and a huſband.</p>
                  <p>Theſe reflections alternately force them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon my mind; and as our happineſs in life, depends upon that of our friends, my pleaſures have ever been impeded. The ſocial, benevolent, and ſympathetic, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in the ſorrows of each other. Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy and benevolence are among the pleaſing ſignatures of the human heart; and he who is diveſted of them, muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, be a Miſanthrope. Agreeable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions, greatly contribute to our enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life. Many are the tears I have ſhed, at the idea of being without a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion capable of directing my youthful ſteps. But heaven has hitherto ſupported me. May I yet be enabled to encounter the difficulties which await me. I remain im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutably the ſincere friend of Maria.</p>

                  <p>THE unfeeling conduct of Mr. Gardner, to his deceaſed unfortunate broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, is ſo ſtrongly impreſſed upon the amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Fanny, that ſhe cannot ſuppreſs the ſilent tear. It inſenſibly ſteals down her languid cheek, and I fear ſhe will fall a victim to that exquiſite ſenſibility ſhe ſo largely poſſeſſes, and ſink with the weight of her affliction to the grave. Repoſe has fled her couch: Her pillow is wet with the dew of ſorrow, and exhauſted nature finds no relief from momentary ſlumbers. I frequently remind her, that although the preſent diſpenſations of Providence are enrolled in darkneſs, we muſt not murmur; that afflictions are to prepare us for ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our happineſs in a better ſtate of exiſtence; and that they are neceſſary to diſengage
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:025584_0373_0FCE064B83DA9668"/>
us from a world, to which we ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be too much attached. "Far from my heart, Caroline," ſays ſhe, "is every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining thought; but the commands of the Deity to thoſe in affluence, force upon my afflicted mind. Are we not expreſsly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden not to harden our hearts, or ſhut our hands againſt our brothers, but to open wide unto them, and to lend them ſufficient for their need, in that which they want, leſt they cry unto the Lord, and it be a ſin againſt us? This is a duty ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impreſſed. We are told we ſhall ſurely give unto them; and that our hearts ſhall not be grieved, when we give unto them. The reward is affixed to the fulfilment of the duty, and for this the Lord thy God ſhall bleſs thee in all thy works, and in all that thou putteſt thine hand unto.</p>
                  <p>"This ſacred volume enforces it upon us to remember them that ſuffer in adverſity, as being ourſelves alſo in the body. But how widely has my brother deviated from the commands of heaven, which forbids us to be covetous. Man's life conſiſteth not in the abundance of things which he
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:025584_0374_0FCE064CE08F8688"/>
poſſeſſeth. The miſer ſaith to himſelf, I will pull down my barns and build greater; there will I beſtow all my goods. I will ſay to my ſoul, thou haſt much goods laid up for many years; take thine eaſe, eat, drink and be merry. But God, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed at the breach of confidence placed in him, ſpeakeſt with a voice from heaven, thou fool, this night thy ſoul ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of thee; then whoſe ſhall thoſe things be, which thou haſt provided? My affliction, Caroline, ariſes from many cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, nor do I wiſh to be deprived of feelings I have long nouriſhed. I regret that a tender concern for objects of diſtreſs has never ſoftened the breaſt of my brother; for upon the benevolent and virtuous tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of the heart, does our happineſs in life greatly depend: To be devoid of feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, is to be reduced to a ſtate of barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm."</p>
                  <p>The force of theſe obſervations cannot be denied. Were mankind actuated by a ſimilar diſpoſition with Mr. Gardner, how would ſociety become involved in acts of inhumanity. On the contrary, if the
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:025584_0375_0FCE064E5933F720"/>
ſavages of our country were civilized and refined, we ſhould not experience the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſcenes of cruel deſolation. Let us, therefore, anticipate the pleaſing period, when knowledge ſhall be diffuſed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the uncultivated foreſt, and the ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable charms of ſocial life ſhall actuate the breaſt of its inhabitants, and cement them by mutual acts of friendly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>

                  <p>LAURA left this city ſome days ſince. The confuſion in which the family have been involved, by the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, preparations, &amp;c. has kept me three weeks a priſoner to my room. I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come quite an invalid.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Helen's attention attaches me to him. He inſiſts I ſhall have the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of a phyſician. But medicine will not heal a bleeding heart. Time only can reſtore tranquillity. While in the preſent abyſs of affliction, I am not to be amuſed by deluſive images of future happineſs. I am abſorbed in the contemplation of my loſs—a loſs aggravated by the unhappy cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which preceded it.

ſuſceptible hearts, derive a ſatisfaction which cannot be defined. In the preſence of our friends, the tumultuous paſſions ſubſide; the care-worn mind is lulled by the ſweetening intercourſe. It enjoys a momentary repoſe; and while it is amuſed with the adventures of youth, it is taught experience by the leſſons of age. In the friendly circle, the attention is diverted from thoſe turbulent ſcenes of folly, which too often engage the mind; and a placid tranquillity favourable to the gentle virtues, ſecure our moſt refined enjoyments. It is not our duty to indulge a deſponding tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Submiſſion ſhould ever mark the chriſtian character. Yet it is hard to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh the objects upon which we had placed our proſpects of future happineſs. The unfortunate Mrs. Gardner, has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of her reaſon, from the firſt moment the fatal information of her huſbands death reached her; and her friends fear the del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>irium rather increaſes than ſubſides.

                  <p>MR. Helen has been abſent a week; and I will acknowledge to Maria, that I feel the loſs of his ſociety. Habit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated to his condoling language, I am ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en ſenſible of impatient moments. That ſincerity he evinces for me, that benevolent, friendly, and affectionate attention he has obſerved to my happineſs, inſenſibly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taches me to him. I am charmed with his unaffected manners. Alive to the gentle emotions, the tender ſentiments of human<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, his mind aſpires with every laudable principle, and his ſoul is exalted by a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour worth. How does my friendſhip, for him, ſoften my ſenſibility! It is this which actuates my mind. Without the pleaſures, which are derived from friendſhip,

exiſtence would be dull and irkſome. We ſhould be devoid of thoſe exquiſite enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we now experience; we ſhould feel a vacuum not to be ſupplied. But this gives energy to life.</p>
                  <p>Your friend, Mr. Trevers, continues to viſit me. I ſincerely wiſh his mind more enlightened, his manners more pleaſing. He intends ſoon to leave us; and has urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to accompany him to Long Iſland.

                  <p>YOUR couſin came upon us by ſurpriſe, although we had expected him ſeveral days. I wrote him a few lines laſt week and mentioned the ſituation of Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, requeſting him, upon his arrival here, to acquaint me with it, previous to his calling at Mrs. Leaſon's, that I might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare my friend for an interview, which I apprehended would ſenſibly affect her; but this letter did not reach camp before he had left it, and unfortunately he met Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the entry as ſhe was paſſing to the carriage, which was in waiting at the door. I ſhall not pretend to deſcribe their ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. There are certain ſcenes, which muſt be felt to be realized; among theſe is the pleaſure of embracing the object of our fondeſt wiſhes, after a painful ſeparation,
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:025584_0381_0FCE0657C459D4A0"/>
and thoſe only who experience a pure affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who exiſt but in the felicity of each other, can realize the rapturous moment. True love is not an illuſion of the mind; it is a paſſion which, by brightening the proſpect of human life, increaſeth the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of its votaries. The boſom of my friend was agitated with joy and ſorrow. The return of her lover from a dangerous excurſion, recalled the loſs of an affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate brother, and their meeting was ſilently expreſſive of a ſincere affection. Mr. Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour had entertained no idea of the ill ſtate of Fanny's health; and the langour, which indiſpoſition had ſpread over her countenance, impreſſed him with a thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs which he could not baniſh. Hard did he ſtruggle to conceal the riſing tear. Thoſe who could have been indifferent to ſo affecting a meeting, muſt be without claim to tenderneſs. I regret that your health obliges you to defer your viſit, having long emboſomed the darling expectation of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you in Philadelphia.

                  <p>YOU think the heart of Caroline in danger; and that, under the idea of friendſhip, ſhe is encouraging affection. I doubted not a pang of jealouſy would ſeize you, when you read my late acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment. "It may," you ſay, "poſſibly be, that I may find a lover, where I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected only a friend." However lively this anticipation, I cannot conſent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive myſelf of an agreeable companion, nor have I the vanity to believe that Mr. Helen has the moſt diſtant idea of a connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion with me. His attentions ariſe from that amiable goodneſs of ſoul, which uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly adorns his actions. Conſidering me as an unprotected woman, he kindly ſteps forward, as a brother, to adviſe me; but be aſſured, it is only friendſhip which actuates him. That he is my friend, I
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:025584_0383_0FCE065A57D8BC80"/>
have every reaſon to believe; I am flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his partiality; I am grateful for it; I thank you, however, for your caution, and will endeavour to keep a watchful eye upon my heart. I am alſo aware of the ſentiments of the world, who immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtyle attention, courtſhip; nor am I ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant with what avidity, fancied connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions are circulated abroad. You ſay, "From the character I have given you of Mr. Helen, you acknowledge there is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle danger that he will exerciſe any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from the diſcovery of my partiality; although it is poſſible he means to gain my affection, previous to a declaration of his attachment." Be aſſured, Maria, I ſhall never diſcover the ſentiments of my heart, in a way which ſhall lincenſe him to aſſume upon it; nor do I think him capable of purſuing a conduct ſo replete with vanity, ſo degrading to the honour of my ſex. No, my dear, upon the diſcovery of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, I will impriſon my affections, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the power of refuſing him, who would thus render me contemptible to myſelf.</p>

                  <p>My affection to your couſin, is enhanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his attention to my declining friend. He has brought with him the pocket-book, journal, and ſword of the late Captain Gardner; theſe he has delivered to my care.

young an officer to diſpute the official ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of his General; but ſhould he be arreſted, and, which is too often the caſe, finally made a ſacrifice to men in power, as he is not dependent upon his commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for his exiſtence, I feel aſſured, that ſpirit of independence, which now marks the inveſtigation, will be his ſupport.</p>
                  <p>The late defeat of the weſtern army, bears a ſtriking analogy to that at Ticon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroga, in 1777; nor was the rapid flight of the army at that place, leſs deſtructive, nor the fate of General Hill diſſimilar to that of the brave Colonel F. who was left, alike unſupported, while his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander fled ſix miles from the ſcene of action! But hiſtory is the accuſer, and diſtant generations will be the judges, at whoſe tribunal the actions of public char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acters will receive their deciſive ſentence. A ſingle error in the life of a great man, has frequently deſtroyed the monument of his fame. A uniform attention to juſtice, is the only foundation that can render him ſecure. Happy they who paſs through life, enjoying the bleſſings of ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

                  <p>YOUR friend, Mr. Trevers, will take his leave of Philadelphia to-morrow. He has figured much among the ladies in this city, and will be miſſed as a gallant. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his manners—tell me if he is improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. His father, he informs me, wiſhes him to adopt ſome profeſſion; and as he has had a liberal education, propoſes he ſhall ſtudy the law; but ſtudy he cannot abide; he is indeed too indolent to pay at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to any thing but the ladies; and they truly inſpire him. If he is calculat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a polite circle, it is where the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation ſeldom exceeds the raging faſhion, and trivial inquiries ſupply the place of better obſervations. I doubt if he would make a graceful orator. Methinks I ſee
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:025584_0400_0FCE067AB9A14008"/>
him at the bar. Half a dozen hems ſucceed every expreſſion. His words are deſtroyed by the peculiar delicacy with which they are uttered, while his hands, unformed for grace, now fix his cravat; now pull down his waiſtcoat.</p>
                  <p>He is impatient to become a married man. Much ſhall I pity the lady with whom he is connected. If ſhe poſſeſſes ſentiments ſimilar to my own, ſhe muſt indeed be wretched. He will truly be a faſhionable huſband. Ardent as his firſt attachments may be, he cannot long relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh his favourite pleaſures; and unleſs ſhe is a faſhionable wife, her happineſs will be ſacrificed to his darling amuſements. But ſuch there are, who are moſt gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when ſeparated from each other. A lady, educated in a vortex of amuſement, has little idea of any happineſs, but that which reſults from a round of diſſipation. Her mind is employed in new plans of dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orating her perſon; and when connected with a man of correſpondent taſte, they form a faſhionable pair. In a ſhort time they are diſguſted with the ſociety of each

other. They purſue ſeparate gratifications; ſeldom paſſing an hour at home together; and if they chance to meet in company, are civil to each other: But this, ſhe does not regret.</p>
                  <p>Such a woman is beſt calculated for your friend, Mr. Trevers; but happier they, who paſs through life, enjoying the ſuperiour bleſſings of a ſincere attachment. May this happineſs be the lot of Maria and</p>

Fanny is very ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous to accompany him: But although ſhe is ſurpriſingly better, ſhe is totally unfit to undertake ſo long a journey at ſuch an uncertain ſeaſon of the year.

                  <p>SINCE I laſt addreſſed my friend, a ſtrange incident has taken place. I have already acquainted you that Mr. King being ſoon to ſail for England, had hurried the propoſed connexion. The evening had arrived, the company aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, the miniſter every inſtant expected, when a loud knocking at the door, was ſuppoſed to announce his arrival; but this proved a letter to Mr. King; and the bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er requeſted to ſee him in private. Soon after, Mrs. Leaſon was called out of the room. Here unfolded a ſcene, to which all deſcription is inadequate; and of ſuch a nature, that it could not be communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the diſappointed company. A meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger was, however, inſtantly diſpatched, to acquaint the clergyman that the wedding
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:025584_0410_0FCE068CA3A18D30"/>was deferred; and the company were told, by a particular friend, that for certain rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which could not then be divulged, the wedding was poſtponed. Various con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures aroſe, in the breaſts of all who were preſent, but none could ſolve the real cauſe. For ſeveral days, I was myſelf a ſtranger to the true circumſtances, until, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated importunities, I prevailed upon Mrs. Leaſon to entruſt me with the ſecret, when ſhe gave into my hand the following letter:</p>

                        <p>MR. James King, the young gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man I take the liberty to introduce to you, is the natural ſon of our mutual friend the late Captain John Leaſon, who, for many years, ſailed from Philadelphia in the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don trade. His father upon his arrival here, ſoon after his birth, appropriated the intereſt of a certain ſum for his ſupport and education, and appointed me the guardian of this youth. Pleaſed with his natural abilities and manly ſentiments, I have paid particular attention to my truſt; and as he inclined to the mercantile buſineſs, I took
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:025584_0411_0FCDE9F3E8D71BD0"/>
him into my counting-houſe, and ſince he has been of age, into partnerſhip with me. He has been taught to conſider himſelf an orphan, and has ever been called King; but knowing your attachment to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed father, I thought fit to communicate a ſecret to you, which I never before diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed to any perſon. He is on a viſit to Philadelphia, and, if he finds it agreeable, intends to eſtabliſh a houſe in that city; but his ſtay will be ſhort, as matters of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence render it indiſpenſibly neceſſary that he ſhould be in London in June. If he can poſſibly find leiſure to viſit you, I have enjoined it upon him, and any atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhewn to him will be gratefully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by your friend and humble ſervant, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>This letter, it appears, upon his arrival, he forwarded to Connecticut, and upon the receipt of it, the gentleman to whom it was written, ſent a preſſing invitation for Mr. King to pay him a viſit; to this polite and friendly requeſt, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned for anſwer, that a multiplicity of buſineſs, and the pleaſing connexion which he was about to form with a widow

Leaſon, together with his being obliged to return immediately to England, put it out of his power. Upon the receipt of this, his friend was alarmed, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately wrote by expreſs, to prevent the marriage; in which letter he encloſed the above. The timely moment of their arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val was, indeed, a happy circumſtance.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Leaſon is much affected at the event. The attachment ſhe felt for Mr. King when ſhe conſidered him as her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, muſt be very different from that fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ial affection ſhe muſt now experience. Mr. King was born two years before the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of Mrs. Leaſon. This, with the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which ſhe retains for her deceaſed huſband, ſtrongly attaches her to his ſon. However the above ſtory may reſemble fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or romance, be aſſured it has made too deep an impreſſion upon my heart, eaſily to be effaced.</p>

                  <p>FANNY and myſelf, coming from church on Sunday laſt, were addreſſed by a young gentleman to whom I was a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; but in ſuch a familiar way, that I was ſoon convinced he was an old acquaintance of her's. He gallanted us home. When we reached Mrs. Leaſon's, with an air of indifference, ſhe paſſed upon him the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment of walking in. This invitation he readily accepted. She now introduced him to Mrs. Leaſon and myſelf. I found, by her unuſual reſerve, that he was not agreeable to my friend. From his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation I diſcovered he had been abſent three years; and had but juſt returned to Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica. In the evening, Mrs. Leaſon wiſhing me to viſit a particular friend, propoſed my going with her. To this I agreed,
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:025584_0414_0FCE069359898578"/>
and we left them, promiſing to return in a ſhort time. But the hours, in agreeable company, paſs with great rapidity; and we had lengthened our viſit far beyond our intention, before we were aware of the time we had been from home. Yet upon our return we found Mr. Aſhely with Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Immediately upon my entering the room, I diſcovered his agitation. I had a ſtrong propenſity to be acquainted with the hiſtory of this young gentleman, and as ſoon as he withdrew, applied to my friend for the circumſtances of their firſt acquaintance.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Aſhely," ſaid ſhe, "belongs to Maryland; but was educated with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle in Havre-de-Grace, and has, for many years, fooliſhly encouraged a partiality for me. This I have invariably aſſured him I cannot return. His friends, alarmed by the conſequences of my obſtinate refuſal, have repeatedly intereſted themſelves in his behalf. My own connexions were for ſome time deſirous that I ſhould encourage his attentions; but my heart has uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſavowed every favourable ſentiment
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:025584_0415_0FCE0695DB8CDF28"/>
for him; and I have conſtantly declared it impoſſible ever to be his; yet he has per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted to encourage his unhappy attachment —I have been wretched by his perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. At length his friends, convinced I could not be brought to conſider him as a lover, ceaſed their importunity, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed him to avoid my company. I alſo aſſured him, unleſs he could reſolve never to mention a ſubject ſo painful to me, it was my determination to ſeclude myſelf from his ſociety, and never to ſee him more; but if he would viſit the family as a tranſient acquaintance, he might rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my treating him with every civility; and that on this footing alone, he muſt in future expect to meet me. After this he became negligent of his buſineſs, which increaſed the uneaſineſs of his friends: They urged him to take a voyage to India; and his uncle made him ſuch propoſals as induced him to accede to their wiſhes. From this voyage he has juſt returned, and accidentally has diſcovered my being in this city; he has already renewed the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his paſſion; I muſt therefore deny
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:025584_0416_0FCE06973891BC38"/>
myſelf to him; and if unfortunately I ſhould fall into his company, I muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you never to leave me alone with him."</p>
                  <p>It is unhappy for Mr. Aſhely that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give up a woman who entertains not a partial ſentiment for him. I regret that he has diſcovered her being in Philadelphia, and ſhall exert myſelf to prevent every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview between them.

                  <p>IT appears to be the determination of Mr. Aſhely, at all events to obtain the hand of Fanny. He has been ſeveral times with me, ſoliciting my influence with her; and aſſures me his whole happineſs depends upon it. This accompliſhed, he thinks nothing could impede the pleaſures of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture life. I have endeavoured to impreſs upon him the neceſſity of his relinquiſhing the idea, as ſhe is abſolutely engaged to another; and that this alone, would be a bar to every proſpect of a union with him. "Abſolutely engaged to another," ſaid he, "where is the enviable man?" I replied, gone to viſit his friends. "If this is to prevent my further application, know, Madam, that I ſhall not ſo eaſily relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh the object of my warmeſt affection.
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:025584_0418_0FCE069AE40B6AC0"/>
Life, without Fanny, is inſupportable. Werter could not exiſt when Charlotte was beyond his reach. I will have one more interview with her—beg her to grant this laſt requeſt," Fanny, ſaid I, has been many months deprived of health; I wiſh rather to relieve her mind from every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy thought, than add to her anxiety by an application which muſt be painful to her. Nothing favourable can reſult from the interview.</p>
                  <p>He walked the room in great agitation; and preſently ſeating himſelf at the table, wrote a few lines which he deſired me to give her. Unwilling he ſhould think that I influenced her, I rung the bell for the ſervant, and ſent her up ſtairs with the bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let. To this ſhe returned for anſwer, that he was well acquainted with the ſentiments from which ſhe had never deviated, and muſt be excuſed complying with his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.</p>
                  <p>He now came towards the fire, and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from his pocket the Sorrows of Werter, he turned to a page where this ſophiſtical reaſoner, fallaciouſly argues in favour of
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:025584_0419_0FCE069C5B96FD00"/>
ſuicide; and reading it exclaimed, "My ſentiments, oh Werter! are ſtrictly conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with thine. Life without the object of my wiſhes, would be a void." You cannot, ſaid I, juſtify a conduct ſo repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible as Werter's. A conduct, which uniformly demonſtrated a weak, and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mind. Conſider that Charlotte was a wife; conſequently he could have no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of honourably obtaining the object of his wiſhes. Was it not his duty to cruſh every idea of a criminal attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Inſtead of which, he glories in the wicked indulgence of an impious paſſion, and ever ſtands ready to commit the moſt atrocious deeds. He impoſes no reſtraint upon his inclination, but deducing his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments from the moſt abſurd cauſes, he endeavours to juſtify a conduct fatally er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous. Trace his extravagant beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and it will evidently appear, that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price, pride, and paſſion, are the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which govern his actions. By no means, Mr. Aſhely, ſaid I, encourage the ideas of that writer. It is expoſing yourſelf to the immediate precipice of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:025584_0420_0FCE069F1BB36A58"/>
"Make him," ſaid he, "what you pleaſe; ſophiſtical, fallacious, vile; upon his arguments I am willing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend for my future happineſs." When he had ſaid this, he was greatly agitated, and left the room. Believe me, at this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment every ſentiment of my heart beat for the unhappy ſituation of the deceived youth.</p>

                  <p>This letter ſhe ſent in the morning. In the afternoon, as Fanny and myſelf were ſitting in the parlour, with Mrs. Leaſon
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:025584_0423_0FCE06A55AC65308"/>
and a young lady from Lancaſter, who boards in the family, Mr. Aſhely was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into the room by the ſervant: He had a ſmile upon his countenance, yet appeared diſcompoſed; an eye of ſurpriſe was alternately caſt at each other; our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhment muſt have been viſible to him. Poſſeſſed of great aſſurance, he placed himſelf next to Fanny, and ſoon took an opportunity of expreſſing his doubts of a future exiſtence; obſerving, that mind muſt be puſillanimous indeed, that could conſent to drag out a wretched life, when one inſtant would put a period to miſery. "A period to miſery," ſaid Fanny, "you may indeed terminate the life of the body, but the ſoul, Mr. Aſhely, is immortal, and muſt ſuffer an eternity of bliſs or woe. We are here upon trial; a certain time is allotted us; the number of our days is unknown; and at the tribunal of our Maker, we ſhall be accountable for our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on earth. There the deciſive ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence will be paſſed upon us—a ſentence, from which there is no appeal. We have within, an unerring monitor, which dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:025584_0424_0FCE06CB97225148"/>
our duty. Its dictates we cannot miſtake. Its injunctions are not to be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated with impunity, any more than the laws of ſociety are to be broken without puniſhment. Can he whoſe conduct is marked with ſacrilege, who ruſhes into eternity with a heart oppoſed to the ſacred character of an offended Deity, ſeriouſly expect the forgiveneſs of an angry God? Or muſt he not tremble to meet the ſupreme Judge of all, who will baniſh him from his preſence, and conſign him to everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miſery!" "A future exiſtence," repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mr. Aſhely, "is uncertain; and if true, I have no idea of a never-ending puniſhment. It is inconſiſtent with the benevolence of the Deity; nor would a life paſſed in the moſt atrocious crimes, on a retroſpect, add one thorn to my expir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moments."</p>
                  <p>With ſuch ſentiments, it is not ſurpriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he ſhould advocate the right of taking away his own life, whenever it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes irkſome to him. How deſtructive ſuch principles to human happineſs! How derogatory to reaſon, philoſophy
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:025584_0425_0FCDEA0600AFA0F0"/>
and religion! I tremble for the event. Fanny is undoubtedly right, in refuſing a man ſhe cannot love. A young lady is not to be anſwerable for the conduct of a raſh, unprincipled youth; nor is ſhe oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſacrifice the happineſs of her life, leſt her lover ſhould blow out his brains, or ſwallow a doſe of poiſon.

                     </gap>y, upon his arrival in this city, waited upon me with your letters. I am happy you are ſo far recovered, and flatter my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf you will ſoon be able to meet me here. Believe me, until the arrival of your let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, I was totally unacquainted with the connexion likely to take place between Maryann and Mr. Hervey. Had I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized ſhe was to be the ſiſter of Maria, I ſhould have been aſſiduous in cultivating a friendſhip with her; though her nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous engagements, ſince ſhe has been in this city, and the indiſpoſition of Fanny, would in a meaſure have retarded it. From this moment, however, I ſhall improve every opportunity to make her my friend.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="205" facs="unknown:025584_0429_0FCE06AA9CBED748"/>I am diſtreſſed with the continual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of the unhappy Mr. Aſhely, to intercede with Fanny, for but five min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utes private converſation with her. When he has been gratified in this point, he promiſes to quit her for ever. I have been finally obliged to aſſure him of my influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence if he will wait a few days, until ſhe recovers. He embraces every opportunity to read me ſome paragraph of his favourite author, which he always carries about him. How are the literary talents of this writer proſtituted, in the encouragement of the moſt atrocious crimes! Muſt not the juſt indignation of every virtuous mind fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him? In this heart of man, vice ſhoots ſpontaneous; we need not hale poiſonous ſentiments, to encourage its rapid growth. The ſoil is luxuriant; to ſuppreſs and prune the riſing ſprouts, has required the utmoſt vigilance of the moraliſt in every age and country.</p>
                  <p>Neither ſublimity of compoſition, an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ergetic and affecting ſtyle, nor the falſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of argument, can ever compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate for the injury that vague minds receive,
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:025584_0430_0FCE06AC1DA105A0"/>
from the peruſal of thoſe publications, where ſuicide is repreſented as heroiſm; nor can the writer of the Sorrows of Werter, ever make atonement for the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry he has done to ſociety.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Aſhely is greatly to be pitied. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing connected all his ideas of happineſs with the darling hope of obtaining fanny, he diſregards every other conſideration. Thus fooliſhly are we, through life, fixing upon certain objects, from which we fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy we ſhall derive our future pleaſures; and making our happineſs entirely depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent upon them, we expoſe ourſelves to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numbered calamities, unmindful that a ſingle moment could deſtroy our proſpects, and whirl us to the abyſs of ſorrow.

                  <p>I FEEL uncommonly dull. Our parlour, not long ſince the region of love, where I fancied Cupids in every corner, is now deſerted by all but Mr. Aſhely; and he avails himſelf of every oportunity to urge the fulfilment of my promiſe. This morning, while we were at breakfaſt, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the room; an uncommon agitation was viſible in his countenance. After a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle apology for his intruſion, he walked about for a conſiderable time without ſpeaking; at length coming to me, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after Fanny, and wiſhed to know if ſhe was well enough to be ſeen. She has had a tolerable night, ſaid I, but I have not yet mentioned your wiſhes to her. Turning from me with diſguſt, he went to the table, and taking out of his pocket, pen, ink and paper, wrote the following:</p>

                  <p>GRACIOUS Deity! What a ſcene will this letter unfold to Maria! Be prepared for the dreadful recital of my uncommon misfortunes. Yet how ſhall I diſcloſe to you that calamity in which I am involved! The relation of the ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful tale cannot, however, be diſpenſed with. The awful hand of death has arreſted from me my Fanny—my companion, my friend. A dreadful tragedy has been acted ſince I wrote you laſt. Mr. Aſhely—deteſted name—himſelf the murderer of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject he adored! Excuſe me, I am loſt in grief, horror and amazement. I muſt wait a compoſed moment—at preſent I cannot write.</p>
                  <p>I will endeavour to explain the hiſtory of my woe. I will not thus give way to

ſuggeſtions of deſpair. At the fatal hour, Mr. Aſhely returned to know the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of Fanny. I was ſitting in the chamber with my friend, when the girl came to acquaint her that he was below. She requeſted that he might be aſked up ſtairs into the drawing-room; where, in expectation of company, a fire had been kindled, and went herſelf immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. I had a book in my hand, and in vain endeavoured to read; being ſeized with a univerſal horror. In a few minutes the report of a piſtol, like a ſevere ſhock of electricity, deprived me of my ſtrength; the firing was inſtantly repeated; Mrs. Leaſon and the family were alarmed; and running up ſtairs, opened the door of the drawing room, when a ſpectacle preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which reality only can give a juſt idea of. For ſome time, every exertion I made to riſe was in vain. The general, the pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcream, which immediately ſucceeded the opening of the drawing-room door, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced me Mr. Aſhely had committed the act of ſuicide; but I had no idea, that he had alſo taken away the life of my friend.
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:025584_0435_0FCE06B5FA71C6D8"/>
I ſtill ſat waiting in expectation that Mrs. Leaſon would come into my chamber; until the trembling which at firſt ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me had a little ſubſided. At length I aroſe, and going towards the chamber door, opened it; when I had a full view of Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. She was leaning back in an arm chair; the blood profuſely poured from her wound; nothing can ever efface the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions the horrid ſight has made upon my mind. Mr. Aſhely had fallen upon the floor by her ſide, and was alſo covered with the crimſon fluid. My power of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was loſt; my ideas ſuſpended. Mrs. Leaſon came to me; ſhe led me to a chair; the neighbours were already alarmed; the houſe was crouded.</p>
                  <p>The bleeding, mangled ſhade of the amiable Fanny, is continually before my eyes. Our houſe is one conſtant ſcene of horror. Oh, Maria! how does frail humanity need conſolation, when beſet with affliction! The anguiſh of my ſoul is inexpreſſibly ſevere.</p>

                  <p>Deluded youth! "caſt himſelf upon the mercy of a benevolent and forgiving God." Could he, in the cool moments of reflection, if ſuch he ever had, ſuppoſe that he, who with one hand deſtroys the life of his friend, and with the other ſends himſelf into eternity, ſhall ever receive that wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſentence, "come ye bleſſed," &amp;c. What would be the ſituation of ſociety, if crimes were unpuniſhed? If the murderer was ſecured from juſtice? Does not the penalty of the laws deter from vice? Can we ſuppoſe that the Deity, who has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced a woe unto thoſe who obey not his commands, will neglect to inflict the threatened puniſhment? Were thoſe his ſentiments, they are fraught with error, they are ruinous to ſociety, and deſtructive to the youthful mind.

No more ſhall I enjoy the pleaſure of ſeeing her I ſo tenderly loved; no more ſhall I preſs to my boſom, my diſtracted boſom, my companion, my friend. But the hand of friendſhip ſhall wipe from the eye of Caroline, the riſing tear; and by the ſolacing attention of Maria, my ſoul ſhall yet emerge from its preſent dejection.</p>

                  <p>I recal to mind the countenance of Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. In it there was a ſublime harmony; her eyes were admirably expreſſive of the
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:025584_0441_0FCE06C09F0A26D8"/>ſofter paſſions; a natural grace, was united with a friendly behaviour; ſhe was actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by the moſt benevolent ſentiments, and ſtudied, as far as in her power, to leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the miſeries of human life. Poſſeſſed of great mental beauties, ſhe was a pleaſing companion, a real friend. Though long deprived of health, ſhe was ſnatched from life, in a manner the moſt unexpected, and in the morning of youth. On the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of her virtues, will often flow the ſolitary tear.</p>

When the virtues of the deceaſed live in the mind, they afford a ſweet conſolation— a conſolation which cannot be derived from thoſe accompliſhments, that too frequently decorate a newſpaper character, but exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not in reality. When the important moment ſhall arrive which ſhall ſeparate my immortal mind from its feeble manſion, may the pen of the panegyriſt be ſilent. Convinced that I have no virtues which claim an eulogium, I wiſh not my tomb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone to expreſs what I never merited: But if thoſe to whom I have been long attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and who, by the endearments of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual friendſhip are partial to me, wiſh to mark the ſpot which contains the remains of a friend, let this inſcription denote the grave: "The body here entombed, once poſſeſſed a mind warmed with humanity, animated with friendſhip, and glowing with a religious hope."</p>

                  <p>IT is a week, my dear Harriot, ſince I arrived in this city, and every moment has paſſed in the moſt diſtreſſing anxiety. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably to the promiſe I had made Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, of paying her a viſit, I directed the driver of the ſtage to ſtop at Mrs. Leaſon's; but having received, at New-York, a letter from her the preceding evening, I was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to find her from home. Here I waited, with the utmoſt impatience, the return of my friend. I repeatedly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to Mrs. Leaſon, the ſatisfaction which I flattered myſelf would reſult from my viſit to Philadelphia. In the courſe of the evening I experienced many painful ſenſations at their long ſtay; theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:025584_0448_0FCE06C66634E240"/>
with the advancing hours; yet I endeavoured to ſooth my apprehenſions, by forming ſome unavoidable delay. Mrs. Leaſon diſcovering my anxiety, uſed every argument to quiet my fears, and kindly endeavoured to conceal her own uneaſineſs; but convinced that Caroline's impatience to meet me, excluſive of every other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, would have haſtened her early return, had not ſome unhappy circumſtance impeded her wiſhes, it was impoſſible for her to diſpel my anxiety: I therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to my chamber, with feelings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſted to thoſe I had annexed with my arrival in this place. Here I continued till paſt eleven, when a carriage ſtopped at the door. I inſtantly hurried down ſtairs— The voice of my brother was grateful to my ears. I ran to meet him, inquiring for Caroline. He took me by the hand, and led me into the parlour—Where is my friend? ſaid I. He evaded a reply. I caſt my eyes upon Maryann—diſtreſs was viſible in her countenance. I obſerved her turn aſide, as if to conceal her tears. Mrs. Leaſon begged to know what had
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:025584_0449_0FCE06C7D7F4B0C0"/>
detained Mr. Helen and Caroline—I ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onded her ſolicitation. "An accident has prevented them from accompanying us," replied my brother; and paſſing into the kitchen, Mrs. Leaſon followed. I became more alarmed, and went immediately after them. He was ſitting by the table, and Mrs. Leaſon was untying a handkerchief, which was bound round his head, that ſhe might dreſs his wound. I now diſcovered blood upon his face. Mr. Hervey, ſaid I, it is impoſſible for the reality to be worſe than my fears; keep me not thus in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe, let me know what has befallen Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oline and yourſelf. "Be not diſtreſſed," ſaid he, and drawing a chair near him, he requeſted me to ſit down. He now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me, that in conſequence of the letter which ſhe had received from Mr. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, Maryann and himſelf had agreed to accompany her a few miles out of town, in expectation of meeting him; and ſtopping at a public houſe, they called for tea; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding, by the time it was ready, Mr. Helen would be with them; but, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing waited until dark, he propoſed their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:025584_0450_0FCE06CA6C5A4368"/>
to town. Caroline became very unhappy; ſhe took her letter from her pocket, and repeatedly read it over; ſhe ſcrutinized the hand writing—compared it with others ſhe had received from Mr. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, and believed it to be his; nor would ſhe conſent to leave the inn, until nine o'clock. At this late hour they ſat off for home; but had not proceeded far upon the road, before they were attacked by two men; one of whom, ſeizing the bridle of the horſes, fired at the driver, ſhot him in the ſide, and obliged him to come from his ſeat; the other went up to the ſide of the carriage upon which my brother was, and preſenting a piſtol at him, aſſured him not a moment was to be delayed; that their deſign was not againſt his life, but he muſt immediately relinquiſh the lady who was with him. Caroline was ſitting oppoſite to him, and ſeeing his danger, gave the arm of the villain a ſudden puſh, upon which the piſtol inſtantly went off, and ſlightly wounded my brother in the head. Maryann had fainted at the firſt of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack, and had fallen upon the floor of the
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:025584_0451_0FCDE9FE4653B0A0"/>
coach, where ſhe remained during the whole ſcene. The villain who had wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the driver, led the horſes to a tree, where he made them faſt, and joined his accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice. My brother was without any kind of weapon. In vain were his wiſhes to protect my friend—ſhe was torn from him. His attention was now called to Maryann, whom he raiſed up, and acquainted her with what had paſſed. After this, he made a ſearch for the driver, whom he found too much weakened, with the bleeding of his wound, to reſume his ſeat; they therefore took him into the carriage, and Mr. Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey drove home himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Since this unhappy event, every poſſible ſtep has been purſued to diſcover the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Caroline—but exertion has hitherto been ineffectual. It is generally believed that the reſentful mind of Eliza, has plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this unheard of revenge; although it has been given out for ſeveral weeks, that ſhe has ſailed for Europe.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not fail to tranſmit you every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance which takes place, reſpecting the diſcovery of Caroline; and flatter myſelf her ſituation cannot long be concealed.</p>

                  <p>IT it ſeveral weeks ſince you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived my laſt. Nothing has yet occurred reſpecting the diſcovery of Caroline. Mr. Helen's friends, yeſterday received a letter from a phyſician who reſides at a village a few miles from this city, informing them that he lies dangerouſly ill; and requeſting them, without delay, to haſten to him. They ſet off this morning—my brother accompanied them. I am very ſolicitous for his return.</p>
                  <p>Several letters directed to Caroline, which have reached Philadelphia ſince the misfortune that has befallen her, we have been induced to open. They were from

Mr. Helen; and mention, that unexpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted buſineſs having called him to Georgia, he ſhould not be able to return at the time he expected.

                  <p>THE taſk how painful! I have to communicate to you, my dear Harriot, the dreadful, diſtreſſing certainty of my Caroline's fate! All hopes of recovering my friend, are now deſtroyed—my conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation fled—what keen ſenſations accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the diſtracting thought! Every exertion I make to ſuppreſs my grief, ſwells my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom with inſupportable anguiſh. But I will exert myſelf to relate the circumſtanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es as I received them from Mr. Hervey, who left Mr. Helen laſt evening.</p>
                  <p>It appears, that being detained upon the road, he put up at a public houſe in the village, where he yet remains; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:025584_0455_0FCE06DB71488038"/>
intimate with a couple of young gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen who are ſtudying with the phyſician in that town, he called upon them, and was introduced into their room. He had not long been with them, before he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood they were that evening to diſſect the body of a young lady who had died with an uncommon diſorder, and they were anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious to diſcover the ſource of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints; but her friends having refuſed their opening her, they had privately tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en her up, and gave him an invitation to ſtay with them during the operation. This he accepted. The ſubject was ſoon brought out of the cloſet, and the ſheet in which it was concealed untied. Mr. Helen, upon ſeeing the face, diſcovered the countenance of Caroline. A<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

His friends were final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obliged to force him from it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:025584_0456_0FCE06DDC0AFCFD0"/>
him, leſt in his violent fit of diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he ſhould commit ſome outrage. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made him ſecure, they returned to the ſubject, and ſoon diſcovered, that the body, in their poſſeſſion, was not the one they wiſhed to obtain. They had marked the grave, and were certain they had taken it from the ſpot where their patient had been buried; yet the conduct of Mr. Helen ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared very myſterious. Acquainted with his engagements to Caroline, and recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting her being forced from the carriage, with the diſcovery of their miſtake, they ſuſpected the cauſe of Mr. Helen's afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and in this they were confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by his conſtant repetition of Caroline's name. A violent fever ſoon ſeized him, and an expreſs was, the next morning, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched for his friends, who have no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of his recovery.</p>
                  <p>Upon opening the grave the next day, the coffin from which my dear Caroline had been taken, was found; and upon remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, the one that contained the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, theſe young gentlemen were in purſuit of, was diſcovered. It is believed the body of
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:025584_0457_0FCE06DF1A39FD40"/>
my friend was intentionally concealed here, to prevent any ſuſpicions, that might ariſe upon the appearance of a new grave, which could not be accounted for. No marks of violence were found upon her body, and it is thought that ſhe fell a ſacrifice to her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, and died with a broken heart. Altho' we cannot trace the immediate authors of her death, we do not heſitate on whom to fix as the ſource of this calamity. The invariable perſecutions which this unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py girl has experienced from Eliza, will li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe every conjecture. Her unreſtrained jealouſy, has been productive of the moſt complicated diſtreſs, to an innocent, amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble woman. Her artful and revengeful mind, has been continually creating ſome malignant deſign againſt her, in which ſhe has finally been too ſucceſsful.</p>
                  <p>How dangerous ſuch a diſpoſition!—how prejudicial to the pleaſures of ſocial life! My preſent feelings are aſſociated with the ſweet remembrance of Caroline's virtues. To do juſtice to theſe I am inadequate; but I will endeavour to copy from her pleaſing example, that my memory may be alike grateful to my friends.</p>
