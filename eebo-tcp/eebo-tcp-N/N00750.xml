         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The perſons to be thus Catechiſ'd and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed are of two ſorts, <hi>Children,</hi> and <hi>grown Youth.</hi> The former are uncapable of knowing the benefit of ſuch inſtructions, ſo as to be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of themſelves to deſire, or ſeek the means thereof; and thoſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt be brought, oblig'd, and if occaſion ſhall be, muſt be ordered and made to come to be Catechiſed, by their reſpective Parents, and Maſters, whoſe duty it is, with <hi>Joſhua,</hi> to take care, <hi>that they, and their houſe ſerve the Lord.</hi> And I have great reaſon to hope that this charge will be duly performed by Parents and Maſters throughout the Province, being the Chief perſons in the ſeveral parts thereof, and whoſe example therefore will be ſufficient to influence others, have ſo ſolemnly declar'd to the World, that the end wherefore they Eſtabliſh Religion is, that their <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Poſterity</hi> may be train'd up in it.</p>
            <p>THE great work will be to perſwade <hi>Youth of riper years</hi> to yeild up themſelves to the Tutelage, and Inſtruction of their reſpective Paſtors, Since that Youth too commonly are vain, headſtrong, and averſe to ſerious Admonitions. But beſides that the methods which will be taken with them, ſhall be ſo free and familiar, as I dare ſay, would not be diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to ſuch as are moſt advanc'd in years; In order to prepare them to be more complyant with the perſwaſions therewith of their reſpective Paſtors, I ſhall make it my preſent buſineſs to engage them eſpecially to an early entertainment, and choice of Religion.

And of the ſame nature is this expreſſion alſo <hi>Rememember your Creator.</hi> For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To <hi>Remember our Creator</hi> does neceſſarily ſuppoſe a due knowledge of him, for that it is impoſſible to <hi>remember,</hi> or call to mind what we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had any knowledge of. Now Almighty God may be known by his Creatures both in his Nature and Attributes; and in his works of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Providence, and of Grace; and in thoſe excellent and gracious Laws which he has given to us to govern our Lives and Converſations in this World. And in all theſe reſpects it ought to be the chief ſtudy of Mankind (whom above all inferiour Creatures he has made capable of ſuch knowledge) thus to know him; eſpecially it concerns Youth to furniſh themſelves with ſuch knowledge of their Creator betimes, as it is ordered them, and as they are adviſed here in my Text. <hi>Remember thy Creator, in the days of thy youth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p>HIS <hi>Creation</hi>! and Good God! what aſtoniſhing Power was his! which, with one Word of his Mouth could call forth out of Nothing, the whole frame of Nature which we behold; rhis Earth which we now tread upon, and yonder Heavens alſo, which we hope ere long to mount into!

Why for his worthy Actions you will find, <hi>Becauſe I delivered the poor that cry'd, and the Fatherleſs, and he that had none to help him. The Bleſſing of him that was ready to periſh came upon me, and I cauſed the Widdows to ſing for joy, I put on Righteouſneſs and it clothed me, and Judgment was as a Robe and Diadem; I was Eyes to the blind, and Feet was I to the lame, I was a Father to the poor, and the Cauſe which I knew not, I ſearched out. And I brake the Jaws of the wicked, and pluck'd the ſpoil out of their Teeth. Then my glory was freſh in me, and my Bow was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in my hand. Unto me Men gave Ear, and waited, and kept ſilence at my Council; after my words they ſpake not again, and my ſpeech drop'd upon them, and they waited for me as for the Rain. And they open'd their Mouth wide as for the latter Rain. If I laughed on them, they believed it not, and the light of my Countenance they caſt not down. I choſe out their Way, and ſat Chief, and dwelt as a King in the Army, as one that comforteth the Mourners.</hi>

He promiſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to thoſe that have, or make uſe of the Talents they have, that more ſhall be given; But he does aſſuredly threaten, that from thoſe who have not, ſhall be taken away, even that which they have. And ſo God knows it often happens, that the Divine Patience is at length ſo worn out, that his Grace is wholly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from ſome Men; and they are given up to a Reprobate Senſe as irrecoverably loſt, and have in Effect the dreadful Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon them, even before they go out of this World.</p>
            <p>BUT do we not ſometimes ſee Men Recover at laſt, by a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Grace? It is true, but as Miracles are very rare, and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Why by ſome terrible Blow to them in their Perſons, or Families; by ſome diſmal Calamities, and Loſſes in their Eſtates, or perhaps by ſome amazing Stroaks of Conſcience. And is this adviſeable to put thy ſelf into ſuch a State, that the way to bring thee out of it, is to make thee a moſt miſerable Creature? Can this be a Hopes to be depended upon, by one that values not a Courſe of Sin, but for the Pleaſures of it? How contradictious are the Reaſonings of ſuch Men, who indulge themſelves in a Courſe of Sin in their youthful Days, in hopes hereafter to be brought to a better Senſe of it. The Senſe they muſt hope to be brought to, will be but little differing from the Pangs of the Damn'd; the better way therefore will be by a timely Religion which has no Remorſes following it, to prevent the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity

            <p>TO Remember him! How I pray you? Why as I told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; ſtudy to know him in his Nature and Attributes, in his works of Creation, Providence, and of Grace, and in thoſe Excellent and Glorious Laws he has given us. And then forget not, neglect not to preſent him often to your Thoughts, as thus known. <hi>Remember him</hi> as a diſcerner of the Thoughts and Intents of your Hearts, and let this chaſe away thence all impure, and unchaſt Thoughts, all unrighteous, and revengeful Thoughts, all impious and ungodly Thoughts, that they have not the leaſt entertainment there. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member him as now ſitting in Heaven, and Regiſtering up in a Book all your Words; and let this reſtrain the Exorbitances of an evil Tongue; ſo that henceforth you may ſuffer no Oaths, nor Curſes; no Lies nor Slanders: no cenſuring, nor evil ſpeaking, no Calumnies nor Detractions to be utter'd thence. Remember him next as a Holy and Righteous Judge that Eternally hates Sin,
