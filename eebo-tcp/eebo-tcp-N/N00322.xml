         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>If I mistake not in mine Observation there seems to be a great falling short in that Love and Zeal for the Worship of God, and that Labour and Frequency of waiting upon Him in his House, both on Sabbath dayes and Lecture dayes, that hath been formerly observed in those that have professed Christianity in Truth.

An Argument which if it be Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively urged, and God shall please to <hi>set in</hi> therewith, we shall not need doubt of some good Success.

            <p>There needs not much to be said to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text in order to the clearing of the Text.

            <q>Doct. That it is an exceeding profitable way of spending Time, to spend it in the Publique Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God in his House.</q>
            <p>The best way by a Thousand to one of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving Time, is to Improve it in the way of publique instituted worship. There is more than a Thousand to one difference between Time spent in God's House, and spent any where else. Excellent is the advantage that we may make of Time by using it in the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worship of God, above any other way imaginable.</p>
            <p>Time is one of the rarest Jewels and most precious Talents, with which the Lord is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusting us in this World, our Felicity both here and hereafter depending upon the <hi>well-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving,</hi> of it, and man's Misery arising from hence, because he does not know his Season.</p>
            <p>Then of excellent use must this Truth needs be, which tells us how to <hi>husband our Time</hi> after the best manner, so as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000396_0016_0FA5A8B5A8E62760"/>
oft as you may, Lose no opportunity of being with God <hi>there;</hi> Nothing will be so beneficial to you as your so doing.</p>
            <p>And the Doctrine speaks of Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in Gods's House, for it is that which the Text and Context intend.</p>
            <p>For the proof of this Assertion, there needs the less to be said, because it is so plainly and positively affirmed in the Text, being Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to our belief not only by the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>David,</hi> (a man so able to judge of the worth of a day in God's House, unto which both by the Enjoyment and Want thereof he had been advantaged,) but also coming to us with the <hi>stamp</hi> of Divine Authority upon it. The Spirit of God in <hi>David</hi> gives this Price of a <hi>Day in Gods House,</hi> and therefore we may take it so, and be assured it is not overprized.</p>
            <p>Yet because it is so little practically believed it may not be amiss to spend some Time in the Demonstrating thereof.</p>
            <p>Now the Text saith that <hi>a day spent in the House of God, is better than a Thousand dayes,</hi> it doth not say <hi>where,</hi> or <hi>how spent,</hi> but leaves it indefinitely, and may be understood of so many dayes spent any where else that we may imagine; and we shall find that Time spent in the House of God is better than any other where.</p>
            <p>We may therefore illustrate and prove this
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:000396_0017_0FA5A8B733171230"/>
Truth by considering the various wayes of Spending Time, and comparing the advantage gained by being in the House of God, above what is to be gotten other where, the difference will appear, and the Preference be found where the Doctrine places it.</p>
            <p>Time is spent either in Idleness or Action, in doing <hi>Nothing</hi> (if at least it be possible for a man at any time not to doe something, as in a sense it is) Or <hi>Something.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Then, <hi>To spend Time in the House of God is a Thousand times better than to spend it in Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi> For of Idleness comes no goodness. <hi>In all Labour there is profit, but the talk of the lips tendeth only to Poverty. Prov.</hi> 14. 23. And I fear many an hour that should be spent in God's House is spent so. He that is doing nothing, is getting nothing; for <hi>of nothing comes nothing.</hi> If Conscience tell thee thou hast been standing Idle in the Market place, or doing nothing in thine own house or else-where, thou hadst a Thousand times better been at a Sermon, for there thou might'st have done &amp; gotten some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. A day in the House of God is a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand times better than doing (and so getting) nothing, there being no Comparison between something and nothing. Thò also it is worse than so because it is a sin to be Idle, Yea and a most pernicious and ruinating evil; that
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000396_0018_0FA5A8B775D2CF00"/>
which exposes men to Tentation, and is the occasion of any thing that is sinful. <hi>Idleness was one of the sins of Sodom</hi> (Ezek. 16. 49.)</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>If men are doing something and not utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly idle, yet if not well employed, it's a Thousand times better to be in the House of God.</hi> They may not be Sleeping, Idleing, Sitting still, but very busie, and yet if not a doing good, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, the dreadful wages that will surely be paid to such in the issue, will plentifully evince this Truth. Every sinner shall one day <hi>say, I have sinned and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not. Job.</hi> 33. 27. Sin may be sweet in the committing, but bitterness in the end. <hi>Stollen waters are sweet,—but—the dead are there. (Prov. 9. ult.</hi>) Is not much of that Time which is by some spent in the House of God to their great Advantage, by others else-where mispent in Drinking, Carrousing, Gameing, in Riotting and Drunkenness, in Chambering and Wantonness? And what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit will you find in these things when your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count comes to be made up? The Apostle makes that Appeal to them after they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened and sanctified, (and so best able to judge <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 20, 21.) <hi>What fruit had yee while servants of Sin?</hi> what wages for your service? Shame and Death being the end of those waies; Then you had a Thousand times
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000396_0019_0FA5B6C1A2CC0908"/>
better been in the House of God, seeking Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Life.</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>Time spent in God's House is better than spent about any secular Business or Worldly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns.</hi> It's Lawful, yea a Duty to be diligent in your particular Callings, God hath Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us in the sweat of our brows to get our Bread, and enjoyned us six dayes to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and doe all that we have to doe, and he hath promised us if we acknowledge him in our waies, to direct our pathes, to prosper us whithersoever we turn our selves, to bless our Labour in the House and Field &amp;c. In all this our Labour there is Profit, but yet no such Profit or gain as is to be had in the House of God. Let men be in their Fields, Gardens, Orchards, in their Shops &amp; Ware-houses let them be Labouring, Merchandizing there, and have never so many advantages before them to get by their Commodities, let them buy and sell and get gain, and as much gain as they would propose to themselves, or could wish; yet still one day in God's House is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than a Thousand thus improved. God gives greater wages for working in his House than can be gotten with all our paines and Contrivance in our own. If Farms and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize interfere with your Call of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, if worldly Cares and Business prove Thorns to Choak th Word, to deaden your

Affections thereto, draw away your Spirits therefrom, and hinder your fruitfulness under the same; they are to be lookt upon as Snares and Traps and Cheaters, and to be treated ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly: But use these things how you will, with never so much Care and Circumspection, still your Time in the House of God will be found your best Time.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I may add, that <hi>Time is better spent in God's House, than in Religious duties in a private way; Nor can one spend that Time</hi> lawfully, <hi>much less,</hi> profitably <hi>in private devotions, which is appointed for publick Worship, if God gives him an opportunity of enjoying it.</hi>

            <p>Going to the House of God with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany that keep Holy day, is far more eligible &amp; profitable than tarrying at home tho' a man should read a better Sermon in his own House than he may hear in God's House. Doubtless <hi>David</hi> had his waies of secret Communion with God while in the Wilderness, but he was so far from being satisfied therewithal, that those Tasts he had there served only to increase his hungerings, pantings, breathings after <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>If these two Things be demonstrated, the Doctrine will be abundantly evinced.</p>
            <p>The former Reason or Argument may be thus framed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That place where there are things to be seen and enjoyed that are a Thousand times better than those to be had else where, is the place in which to be one day is better than a Thousand,</hi>

Of the former.</p>
            <p>Here be the best things to be seen and gotten, Profit, Pleasures, Honour are the Idols that the world wonders after, that they sacrifice their Time, strength and spirits unto: Now that which is true Profit or Gain, real Honour, substantial Pleasure is here, and here only to be had.</p>
            <p>Here are true Riches, the Jewel of inestima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble value, which he that gets, gets more than the whole world is worth, and this Pearl is hid in the Field of the Gospel, inclosed within the Pale of the Courts of Gods House.

The Lord in his House makes such provision as abundantly exceeds what is to be found in any other, and those that seriously attend there, do find abundant satisfaction therein. <hi>Psal.</hi> 36. 8.—And as for matter of Honour, none like that which God puts upon them who honour him, as all diligent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious waiters upon him in his House emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently do. It is their glory to come near him and behold his Glory, and there (as in the Context <hi>ver.</hi> 11.) he gives glory and that is true Honour indeed. It is the Honour and Glory of <hi>Angels</hi> to be waiting upon God in his upper House of Glory, &amp; of <hi>Men</hi> to wait upon him in his lower house of the visible Church, where we may both see, speak of and partake in his Glory. To be admitted unto near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to God in his House is a greater Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour &amp; dignity than to be admitted to stand <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> &amp; converse <hi>with</hi> the greatest Potentates upon earth. If men account themselves much honour'd by the Company of great men, much more Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is it to be in the <hi>Company</hi> and dwell in the <hi>House</hi> of the Great God.</p>
            <p>And that which commends the good things of God's House to us above all other, is that they are soul-Blessings, soul-profit, soul-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures

&amp;c. Now as much as the Soul is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than all the world, so much does soul-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit exceed all other profits whatsoever; A little soul-good is infinitly better than a great deal of worldly good, and consequently soul-loss is the worst loss.

Suppose you should be filling your purse by the one, you are thinning your souls by the other; you get bodily refreshment, comfort &amp;c but you lose soul-benefit, and souls-pining will not be recompensed by your estates-thrive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 3. <hi>hear and your souls</hi> shall <hi>live,</hi> work, toyl, labour, and your bodies <hi>may</hi> live (tho' possibly they mayn't neither) but hear and your souls <hi>shall</hi> certainly, assuredly, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly live. If men would but consider that they have souls, and thereupon study the worth of them til they find the preference of their souls to their bodies, they would then prefer soul-enrichments in God's House above all worldly profit or pleasure in their own, but while men are carnal sensual and bruitish, minding only their bodies, and those things that do concern their bodies, this Argument will neither be understood by them nor be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent with them.</p>

hath made us these souls, that he would also make us to know what our souls be, and what is the Concernment of our souls, above all other Considerations in the world, &amp; then we should realize that the enlightning of the soul, converting of the soul, restoring of the soul, Satisfying the hungerings and thirstings of the foul, strengthening us with strength in our soul, communion with the dearly beloved of our souls, and making our souls to rejoyce in Him, the universal prosperity of our souls, and Salvation of our souls at last, all which good things are to be attained in God's House, are the Best of all blessings and consequently the attending on God there the most profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and delightful of all duties, and by many Thousand degrees eligible before all other Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment whatsoever.</p>
            <p>More particularly these that follow are some of those things to be gotten in the House of God that are a Thousand times better than what are to be had else where. <hi>e. g.</hi>

Here <hi>David</hi> met with that Word which was more worth to him than Thousands of silver and Gold, and more sweet than the Honey and the Honey comb. <hi>Psal,</hi> 19. 10. with 119. 103. He that brings his Heart (not his body only, as many do) to the House of God, and laies it under the drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings of God's Word there, he by so doing laies himself in the way of Light and Life, and puts his soul under the Influence of an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance appointed by God for the conveying of all spiritual good to him, it being the Lord's way to do all by his Word. If any of you come to the House of God on a Sabbath day, and there God meet with you and bring your souls within the Net of the Gospel and save you, then you will say it was the best way of spending Time that ever you met with. If the Lord shall please to draw you off from your worldly Occasions and allure you into his House upon a Lecture-day, and there speak to your Hearts, and by his Spirit work upon you for your souls everlasting Good, you will then be as so many living Monuments of the Truth of

            <p n="2">2. Here is the best Company to be had, and such as is a Thousand Times better than what you will meet with else where. And Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is a very attracting thing; for the sake of <hi>good-fellowship</hi> (falsly so called) is many an hour and many a good day in God's House lost, whereas here is that which is truly and deserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly called <hi>Good-fellowhip.</hi> Here <hi>God Father Son</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> are to be seen and Conversed with, the Vision of and Fellowship with God are the great things here to be enjoyed.

They have seen his goings in the Sanctuary <hi>Psal.</hi> 68. 24. and so may we, the sight of that Beauty which <hi>David</hi> there desired <hi>Psal.</hi> 27. 4. is free for us also. This is eminently a Place of drawing near to God, and if you engage your hearts to draw near to him there, he will there meet you and bless you <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 24. Now if you can fare so well in the House of God as to get a fight of him, a good look from him, you will account that Time spent unto unparallel'd Advantage. The beholding of God's Beauty (not gazeing on other vain beauties as too many usually do)

to be our errand hither, and will be an Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravishing and transforming Sight, and so a blessed sight indeed. Here may you see (the Beauty of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the manifold and matchless Beauty of the <hi>LORD,</hi> the beauty of his holiness, this is to be seen in his House which is the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of his Holiness. The Grace, Mercy, Wisdom, Power, Love, and Faithfulness of God are all of them most beautiful things, and these are here to be seen. To see the Lord smiling upon a poor Creature and lifting up the Light of his Countenance over him, Oh how beautiful! Why this is eminently to be seen in his House, Temple-loving kindness worth seeing, and worth thinking on <hi>Psal.</hi> 48. 9.</p>
            <p>Especially here is the <hi>Glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ</hi> to be seen 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. and be sure Christ has a very beautiful face, He is altogether Lovely and every part of him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 10, 16. and in all his Beauty doth he appear in his House, and there is but this one place where he delights in such a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious manner and in such a measure to shew himself. Something of God's Glory and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie does appear in the works of Creation and Providence <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. but above all doth he unveil his Glory in Jesus Christ and in that great work of Redemption wrought out by him, in the other we may see his Footsteps

but in this his Face, and this is a fight to be seen at his House. This glorious, beautiful Draught of the great work of Redemption is hung up in his house, his Presence-Chamber, &amp; exposed to the view of all comers. Here may you see all the Attributes of God concurring &amp; Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operating in the Contriveing &amp; bringing about man's Salvation through a Redeemer; The Mystery of God manifested in the Flesh which the Angels <hi>stoop down</hi> to look into (as the <hi>Greek</hi> word imports 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12.) And this manifold Wisdome of God in Jesus Christ is made manifest unto Principalities and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers by the Church <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. 10, 11. there they see it, thence they learn it.</p>
            <p>There be two Seasons when especially men desire to be and appear to be beautiful, and do therefore set forth themselves accordingly <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> in their <hi>wooing Time,</hi> and on their Espousal or <hi>Marriage day;</hi> So it is with Jesus Christ: Lords Dayes and Lecture-dayes, when the <hi>Gospel</hi> is publickly preached, are Christs <hi>wooing dayes</hi> and therefore doth he then deck and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray himself with all the <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Beauty</hi> that he may allure and prevail with men to have him, that being ravish'd with his Beauty they may consent to his motion. And Sacrament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes are more eminently the dayes of his <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spousals</hi> wherein the Covenant that was before secretly made between Christ and the Soul
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:000396_0031_0FA5B6CCE96BF930"/>
when there was a mutual Consent and promiss pass'd between them, is now more solemnly Renewed Sealed and Confirmed: Now as a Bride cannot forget her Attire, no more will this great Bride-groom of our Souls neither. This therefore makes <hi>being in the Lords House</hi> so much better than <hi>being elsewhere,</hi> because there is Christ thus to be seen: And a far greater sight it is than that which (tho' great) was but a shaddow of this <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 11. <abbr>viz.</abbr> King <hi>Solomon</hi> in the day of his Espousals, a greater than <hi>Solomon</hi> being here. On those <hi>Festival dayes</hi> doth the Lord Jesus put on all the Robes of his Grace, Love, Righteousness, Meekness &amp;c that he may appear in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure as he is among them. He puts on his red Garments, comes in his Blood and Wounds, shews the scars of his Combate with the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of our Salvation, which tho' heart-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sights too, yet in these are his Love and Good-will to his people gloriously discovered. Thus their eies are blessed with beholding the King in his Beauty <hi>Isa.</hi> 33. 17. To see a Church of Christ assembled together in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cercise of the Ordinances of his House in their Temple-Robes, Sanctuary-dress, <hi>Holyday-</hi>gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, regular and exact in their Attendance according to the Order of his House (which is far above the Order of <hi>Solomon's</hi> servants

that help'd to ravish the Queen of <hi>Shoba</hi> 1. <hi>King.</hi> 10. 4, 5.) And further to see Christ come in among them according to his promise in the Riches of his glorious Grace manifesting himself to them; I say to see this, is to see the most glorious sight on this side of Heaven, yea it is Heaven it self, tho' Heaven upon earth. Hence it is that Sion is said to be Beautiful <hi>Psal.</hi> 48. 2. yea and the <hi>Perfection of beauty Psal.</hi> 50. 2. And we may thank our selves if when ever we come to the House of God we do not see these matchless Sights, for Jesus Christ has promised his Disciples <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 20. to be alwaies with them while preaching, and consequently with those that are hearing, In the midst of those that are gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his Name.

            <p n="3">3. My third Appeal is to those that after they have sometimes enjoyed, have again lost the Liberties of God's House (and those that have experienc'd both the sweetness of the enjoyment and the bitterness of the bereave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are best able to judge in this Case) Now they will all tell you with one mouth that there is no place to spend Time in like the House of God. And such is the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>David</hi> in the <hi>Text;</hi> He had lived at the Well-head, been often drinking of the waters of the Sanctuary, and abundantly satisfied with
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:000396_0049_0FA5B6E0F0B3ED10"/>
the Good things thereof, he had lived near the green Meadowes and still waters, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently taken his sweet repast there, he had seen the Lord's Glory and Beauty in the Sanct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uary and had been enlightned, quickned mind comforted there, for which Favours you have him in sundry Psalms tuneing his. Harp and Psaltery and fixing his heart to the Praises of God, and blessing himself and the people is those high enjoyments, in respect of which God had so dealt with Israel as with no other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. But now you find him in quite another Frame, longing, fainting, Crying out like a person in great distress, fareing like a poor forlorn, miserable wretch, in a state most sadly afflictive and deplorable, intimating that the could have been glad to change Conditions with the Swallow and Sparrow, to whom he seems to envy that priviledge which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed and he was bereaved of go what was the matter? what all'd him? why alas this was his Case (a woful Case indeed!) that sweet, precious, beloved place the <hi>House of God</hi> he could not come at, those Glorious and gainful daies which he had with so much pleasure and advantage spent were now past and gone with him, and when or how to be recovered he knew not, and he so demeans himself as one that both understood what he said, and said as

And it is to be noted in both these Psalms (the like also may be observed else where) when bemoaning his Exilement he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver once mentions his own House or his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or family Concerns all which were (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond dispute) according to the value of each very dear to him, but this is the matter with him, <hi>the House of God!</hi> And so when he was driven out of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> he saies nothing of his Kingdom, or Palace, or any Relations he left behind, only the Ark and its Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the House of God where the Lord dwelt and afforded his Presence, <hi>This, this</hi> I say he thought and discoursed of, and thereby shewed what lay at his Heart, and how much he prized them above other Things which he accounted not worthy to be mentioned the same day with these. Thus also when sick <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had the Sentence of Death (that was upon him) reversed, and an Addition of fifteen Years promised, he asked a sign where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might be assured about his going up again to the House of God, as if he had valued his Time of going thither more than all his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Time besides, or as if his reprieval from the Grave were therefore principally

grateful to him because he might have the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of rendering the Lord a further visit there <hi>Isa.</hi> 38. 22. the fear of seeing the Lord no more (probably he means in his House the chief place for seeing God) having been most grievous to him in his sickness <hi>ver.</hi> 11. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he engaged that he would not only goe up thither but dwell there to praise him all the daies of his life.</p>
            <p>And at this day how many just and Righteous ones are there in the world that are begging on their knees with Tears in their eies that they might enjoy one of these dayes of the Son of Man that we have plenty of, they would wonder to see the streets and shops so full of people while a Sermon is a preaching which they would gladly leave their very meat to hear. What a Pathetical lecture would they read you of the worth of Sermons and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances! How feelingly would they discourse of these things and tell you that whatever outward good things are left them they do all avail them little or nothing while banished from the House of God, and how affectionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would they exhort and beseech us to <hi>know in this our day the things of our peace,</hi> to improve every inch of Hearing-Time, and that with utmost Seriousness and Intensness, to believe them while they do give evidence to the Truth of this Doctrine, and in so doing speak what

            <p>So much may serve for the first Reason or Argument.</p>
            <p>The second followes.</p>
            <p>Reas. 2. <hi>One day in God's House is better than a Thousand,</hi> Because serious waiting there is not only the way to have these unparaleld Blessings already mentioned, but also the surest and safest way to obtain all other Good things which we need, and for the getting of which the House of God is too often neglected, yea and to have them sanctified and secured too.

That even this is the way to promote your worldly Advantage too, the words immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately following the Text are a proof of it.

You never knew any man impoverished by spending two houres in a week at a Lecture, nor enriched by the Contrary.</p>
            <p>I have heard of <q>a poor man being asked by a pious Minister why he came not to Lect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure, answered not want of will but meer Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty hindred him, for <hi>that</hi> day in which he did not work his children must not eat, being advised by the Minister to come to Lecture, and promised to be paid for his dayes work he readily came to Meeting, and as constantly for his Pay at Night, but after a little Time being ask'd the Reason why tho' at Lecture he came not for his mony as formerly, he said that he found God had so blest him that he could main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Family, by his labour and spare a Lecture time too.</q>—And if others will try in like manner they shall have the like blessing.</p>
            <p>It is said <hi>Mony answers all things</hi> Eccl. 10. 19. yea but the Blessing of God in the way of serious attending on him in his House will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer mony also, will supply that too. God hath many secret waies to bless his servants, and doth abundantly send in what we lay out for him. Our Fathers in this Wilderness ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd this, they came for the sake of God's House, and he soon filled theirs, turned the

And while the <hi>first love</hi> and zeal for Christ and the things of his House were kept up they had much outward prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; our coldness there has brought thinness and leanness both outward and spiritual upon us.</p>
            <p>This also is the sure way to have all our other good things sanctified to us: By the Word and prayer are all our outward blessings sanctified 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 5. and without this they are a snare and Trap. If men would observe, there is none but loses as much and more than he gains by robbing God of his Time, or at least he loses the blessing, and what is the outward enjoyment without a Blessing? why, it is for his hurt rather than for his good, and its better to want such things in mercy than to have them in wrath.</p>

A most unworthy thing! that God should set up an House among us, and promise to afford us his Presence, and give us a meeting there, and men cann't find in their Hearts to wait on him at the Time and Place appointed. That God should make such preparation for us in his House, and send to invite us, and tell us he will make us very wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come there to the best he has, and that he is there waiting to entertain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> us and be gracious

            <p>To see the High-way to the House of God mourn in <hi>a day of Contradiction</hi> and <hi>treading down in the valley of Vision</hi> because men are through Persecution by an Hand of Violence hindred from walking therein, is a great Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, &amp; matter of sore Lamentation; but to see the High-way thither mourn in a time of Liberty and Encouragement, either because when they may they will not walk therein, or if they do, it is with much Formality and Indifferency, this is much more a Lamentation as being the great sin and provocation of the Lords Sons and Daughters. When the way is blockt up by Persecution it is but the <hi>Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of Professors (tho' the sin of Persecutors) but their own declining when the way is open is the great <hi>sin</hi> of Professors. If when God sets and holds open the doors of his House (which are the Gate of Heaven) they put away Eternal life from themselves, that is far worse than to have others keep them off from it, and the meanes of attaining it. For them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to bid God depart from them is a sorer evil than for others to bid them depart from God.

And indeed such do as it were say concerning God, he may be gone from them if he will, they care not for the Knowledge of his wayes, nor do they desire to see or be acquainted with him.</p>
            <p>Some do this out of Opinion, pretending to have found a better Rule and greater <hi>light within,</hi> and thereupon despise external Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, lay them aside as things beneath them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, calling them <hi>Forms</hi> which persons of their Attainments have no need of, tho' it is much to be doubted that while they cast off In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted Forms (there is a Form of <hi>wholesome Words,</hi> and a Form of <hi>wholsome Worship</hi> also) they leave themselves <hi>without Form</hi> and (its to be feared) will be found (as the ancient <hi>Chaos</hi> was) also <hi>void, and darkness over the faces of</hi> them too, notwithstanding all their pretences to a more-than-ordinary Degree of Light.</p>

               </gap> why, of no less importance is our being at a Sermon, where we are before God the Judge of all, and hearing those words by which we shall be judged at the Last day. How they can be said to <hi>take heed how they hear</hi> who hear themselves asleep, would be good for them to consider when they are awake, and might help to keep them so.

However, possibly that word may then be a speaking which would have suited thy case and reached thy Heart if thou hadst been awake to hear it, and such a Word it may be thou shalt never have an opportunity of hearing again.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware that because he speaks and we regard not, he do not retaliate to us accordingly, that we should speak and call and cry, and he not regard or hear us. Remember the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Example <hi>Act.</hi> 10. <hi>Cornelius and</hi> his Company were not only got together and wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the coming of <hi>Peter</hi> ver. 24.

            <p>It is a great slight put upon a Friend that out of compassion to us, seeing us in a danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous condition has studied a way for our Relief, and is very seriously discoursing us thereabout, and we tell him he must cut short or else we must be gone, and in the Issue goe away before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To such let me say, What have you no need of a prayer after Sermon that God would write in your hearts what hath been sounding in your ears? Does not God deserve to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged and praised for the liberty of a Sermon, and do not your souls need a prayer to him that alone is able to teach you to profit, that his labour in speaking and yours in hearing may not be in vain? And in special how dare you turn your backs upon the Blessing, has the Lord appointed &amp; Authorized his Ministers to bless you in his Name, and are you in so much hast that you cannot stay to hear it and share in it? Beware lest God say of you (as of him <hi>Psal.</hi> 109. 17.) because you delighted not in Bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, so let it be far from you.

If Christ appear to him in his glory, he will say it is good-being here, if Christ as yet appear not, he will account it worth his Labour to continue his attendance in expectation that he may. The sincere seeker cannot be satisfied without finding, the true finder will think he hath never found enough, and therefore will not goe away so long as there is any hope of finding more. He will say with himself, who can tell but the last word in the Sermon, the last clause in the prayer, or the Blessing in the close of the whole may be intended by God as a special Blessing to mee? and accordingly during the whole time of the Duty will keep himself in the way of the Blessing.</p>

            <p n="III">III. That we so carry it towards and under those Ordinances as that we may find the Truth of this Text in our own Experience, which is the genuine fruit of our being sincere in the two foregoing duties.</p>

of this Text and Doctrine, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> That One day here is worth a Thousand, that you may be able to say as we have heard, so have we seen in the House of God, we have heard that there is great profit and Gain there to be gotten, and we have found it so. Do not content your selves (as many do) that you have been there but enquire what you have done and gotten there. To goe in a Round of Duties, Secret, Private, Publique without making any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress or getting any profit, is in it self irrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal and unto God very provoking. You are going up to the House of God to spend a day before him there, now see that it prove a good day to you, that you may have the good of it to your selves, this ought to be every one's Care.</p>
            <p>You would think your selves much to blame if being in extream Want you should come to a plentiful market where all manner of supplies are offered you freely, and you carry home no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with you: And yet how often hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny an Hearer come into God's House and tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried till the Sermon was ended, but carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way not one penniworth of spiritual good, soul-benefit, and it may be not so much as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted or troubled to think on it.</p>
            <p>How did the Spouse behave her self when her Beloved was with-drawn (<hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 1, to 5. she rises, goes about, seeks, enquires of the
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:000396_0101_0FA5A8BC283D3178"/>
Watch-men, never rests till she had found him; and then held him fast and brought him home with her. 'Tis Finding Christ in his House that is the profit of our day's work, that renders Time so advantagiously spent, and therefore this should be sincerely aym'd at, and strenuously endeavoured by every one that comes thither. This was <hi>Mary'</hi>s Case <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 1,—16. she got up early and her busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was not to see the Sepulchre where Jesus was laid, or the linnen Clothes and Napkins in which he was wrapt, but to see Jesus himself, <hi>her Lord</hi> was in her heart, and to see Him was her Errand, hence when others went away with no other sight than the Grave and linnen, she waits and weeps and looking into the Grave there sees Angels, unto whom she gives this reason of her weeping because her Lord was carried away, and turning about enquired of the supposed Gardener for her <hi>Lord,</hi> and being thus earnest and unsatisfied in her Enquiries at last she found him.</p>
            <p>Thus should every one behave himself having realized to himself that the Ordinances of God's House are wayes of Communion with Christ and that <hi>there</hi> lies the good of them, he should make that his busines and be content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with nothing unless he attains his end: It should not satisfie him that he hath been at the place where Christ is wont to appear, and that
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:000396_0102_0FA5A8BDAFE8F038"/>
he hath been at the place where Christ is wont to appear, and that he hath been under Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances in which Jesus Christ is wont to be conveyed, but he must goe and wait with an heart fixt for Christ himself, and sadly bemoan himself under a disappointment there, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such the Lord will make good that word <hi>Isa.</hi> 45. 19. <hi>I said not to the seed of Jacob seek ye my face in vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In no Duties is the Word of God more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn than about those of his House. See the dreadful charge to him that preaches 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 13. <hi>I give thee charge in the sight of God who quickeneth all things, and before Jesus Christ &amp;c.</hi> So again 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1, 2. <hi>I charge thee before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his Kingdom, Preach the Word, be instant in season and out of season &amp;c.</hi> In obedience to which Command are Lectures set up; and can you think that you which <hi>hear</hi> are not under a like Charge? Shall they that preach be so charged to preach &amp; <hi>so</hi> preach as in the sight of him that will judge them for their preaching, and may you that are to hear think to scape the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God if you hear without Seriousness and Profit? Does not his <hi>Strictness</hi> with them that <hi>preach,</hi> more than intimate that he will also be <hi>exact</hi> with them that <hi>hear?</hi> If they must take heed to themselves and their Doctrine,
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:000396_0103_0FA5A8C075BA8FF8"/>
you must take heed to your selves and your Hearing. If they must speak so for matter, and manner, and end, as they that look to answer it at the great and dreadful Day; you must hear upon the like peril.</p>
            <p>There is no serious preacher of the Gospel but goes with an akeing heart about his work, and when he has preached is ready to condemn himself for fear lest he hath not so spoken as he ought to have spoken; and I believe that there is no serious Hearer but will see cause to ask himself, and have I so heard as I ought to have heard?</p>
            <p>Let us pray for <hi>David</hi> spirit, Affection and Experience, of which there is but little now a dayes to be found.</p>
            <div type="directions">
               <head>Take a few Directions.</head>
               <p n="1">1. Be well acquainted with the Being, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Worth, and Need of your souls.</p>
               <p>Know that you have souls, how many live as if they had none? Consider also they are immortal Existences and must live for ever. Theu <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> your selves with their Needs, listen to their Gravings, and think of what a necessity they are in, of a Supply.</p>
               <p>Your souls are a Thousand times better than your bodies, and therefore Providing for them of a Thousand times more Concernment.
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:000396_0104_0FA5A8C1A8ECC6B0"/>
Oh, an immortal Soul, eternal Estate, and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Life are momentous Considerations, and should be attended accordingly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This being supposed, it will necessarily follow that you are indispensibly bound to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend all meanes that God has appointed for the Salvation of your Souls. Neglecting means for outward Subsistence, or bodily Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance will bring you to Penury; then neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting meanes for your soul's maintenance will issue in Ruin and Misery.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Press on your souls the stamp of Divine Authority that is upon the Ordinances of his House. Here God will be found, &amp; if you slight these wayes of his appointing, he will not be found else where. And be assured that God will not deceive you. Here, he hath recorded his Name, and if you wait here, you wait un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Promise of a Blessing, and shall not wait for nothing.</p>
               <p>Then come to the House of God out of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, not out of Custom, nor for any by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Ends, and if you come conscientiously, you will come constantly, I mean as often as God gives you an opportunity.</p>
               <p>To omit one Duty does but make way for our omitting another. Once give way to Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:000396_0105_0FA5A8C3F786E7A0"/>
and you will never be without them, but they will come in upon you like a flood: Make but a Gap once, and you will scarce know how or when to stop it. And who can tel but <hi>that</hi> season which you lose might have been for your Everlasting Advantage? The diseased persons not knowing when the Angel would come down and move the waters, lay there alwayes waiting to prevent the loss of an opportunity; and so should we.</p>
               <p>A pious soul if providentially detained from God's House growes the more hungry after it, the want of one meal sharpens his stomach and encreases his Appetite for the next; but a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal heart who out of sloth and slightiness neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects it; will grow every day more carless and unconcern'd than other, like a weak stomach; the more it fasts the more it may.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Get suitable preparations for such a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity. When <hi>Jacob</hi> was commanded by God to goe to <hi>Bethel</hi> to worship, he advises his people to <hi>put away the strange Gods; wash their garments and be clean</hi> Gen. 35. 1, 2, 3.

                  </gap> to meet with and entertain the Lord of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at his House which is appointed for a place

of meeting with God <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 23. Hence that charge <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear &amp;c.</hi> When there we must be ready, then there must be some time taken to make ready, and that on penalty of <hi>offering the sacrifices of fools.</hi> He that has so great a work to do, and does not prepare for it, does egregiously play the fool.

               <p n="6">6. Goe thither with answerable Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: We fare no better in the House God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we expect no better. Ayming too low is the way to miss the mark. If after humble Preparation our hearts are big with Exqecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Lord will not suffer our Hopes to be abortive. <hi>The expectation of the poor shall not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish</hi> Psal. 9. 18. Such profit as you have heard of is to be had in God's House, believe it, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for it, carry your empty vessels, open your mouthes wide, expect to have them filled and they shall be filled. Look what you need and

               <p n="7">7. Let your attendance when there, be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to your expectations in going thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Serious Preparation and great Expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation will occasion vigorous Attendance. To come with a sence of great need to a place of full supply, with up-raised Expectations, will oblige a man to look diligently lest he goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way without his Errand.</p>
               <p>The servants of <hi>Benhadad</hi> (1. <hi>King.</hi> 20. 31, 32, 33.) saw what an ill case there master was in, &amp; had heard that <hi>Israel'</hi>s Kings were merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, this gave them encouragement, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared themselves accordingly, in the capacity of humble, perishing, self-judging Suppliants, and in most submissive Language presented their Request before <hi>Ahab,</hi> and then it's said <hi>they did diligently observe whether any thing would come from him, and did hastily catch it,</hi> and accordinly obtained their Desire. Why know that we have far greater encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to wait upon God in his House, we have an Invitation which they had not, we have a Promise to goe upon, wheras they went at a <hi>Peradventure,</hi> upon an <hi>it may be</hi> only: Our necessities also are greater <abbr>

let us prepare thoroughly, come expectingly; and then attend diligently, and catch up every word greedily, withal waiting for the breathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit in an Ordinance, and we shall find that the King of Heaven is far more graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and bountiful than the Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> were merciful.</p>

Watching <hi>after</hi> Hearing is as needful as Watching <hi>unto</hi> Hearing.

As they are like to get but little good by coming to the House of God who come reaking out of their worldly occasions without any prae-consideration or preparation; so they are like to lose or lessen what they have got who rush into the world again without after-consideration <hi>of</hi> or meditation <hi>on</hi> what they have mett with. The <hi>World</hi> was ever a great Enemy to the <hi>Word.</hi> Communing with our own Hearts and Discoursing one with another about what we have heard and seen in God's House, will notably promote our profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency under the same.</p>

And thus often it proves; many a word, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a Conviction, many a good Beginning is lost in the House. From God's House men turn into their own, and <hi>there</hi> in the Business of the House, in the Cares and Pleasures of the House, in the Company of the House, in the various Diversions that they meet with there and elsewhere, all is lost as tho' it had never been.</p>

            <div type="considerations">
               <head>By way of motive take A few Considerations.</head>
               <p n="1">1. Consider whether thy own Judgement and Conscience be not convicted of the Truth of this Doctrine. Doth not Conscience pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim aloud (or at least secretly whisper in thine ears) that all this is is true? Is not God better than the world, and Communion with him than any worldly Gain? And then is it not better for thee to lock up thy doores, shutt up thy shop, and goe to the House of God in the season of it, yea and carry thy people
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:000396_0110_0FA5B65411F38908"/>
with thee too, and if they gain thou wilt gain too, if they gain not thou shalt not lose be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thou hast done thy Duty. Now if thou art convinced, think how it will look in an evil day, to have gone on in the neglect of a duty of which thou hast been convinced, especially so profitable a duty as this. Thou mayst possibly silence Conscience for a while, but canst not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies; it will one day cry like a travailing wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and all the worldly Gain thou hast gotten the while will not stop the mouth of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Know that God will call us to a Reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for all the Opportunities that we have had, and for all that we might have had, whether we took them or no. You shall be accountable not only for all the sermons you <hi>have</hi> heard, but also for all those that you <hi>might</hi> have heard, and nothing but a carnal, careless, vain, earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Heart kept you from. Especially you that have been idleing, fitting still, drinking, game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp;c. the while; God will assuredly set you down in his Book Debitors for such a Sermon, &amp; he will be sure to reckon with you when the Books come to be opened. Here is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision made, the Table furnished, your selves invited, your Trencher laid, your portion car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out for you, and you must pay whether you eat or no; and is it not then best to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and take your share in the Gain, seeing
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:000396_0111_0FA5B6563533D7B0"/>
you must bear your part of the Loss?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Contempt of God's House and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Ordinances of the same will be very griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and offensive unto God, and such neglect will be called Contempt.</p>
               <p>For God to set up his House among us, and be at the charge of continuing to us the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the same, and yet for us to despise and under value them will be highly provoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Indeed it is a sin that has all other sins in it, or attending on it. No duty is well done if this be omitted: You cannot rightly serve God in your <hi>own</hi> Houses if you do not while and when you may, attend Him in <hi>his.</hi>

If you refuse to hear, God may justly refuse to speak. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> shall be made dumb to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious people.</p>
               <p>Let us be awakened, God is threatening to break up House among us, and if ever he so does, our undervaluing of his House will be the cause of it.
