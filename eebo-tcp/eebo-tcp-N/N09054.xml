            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE chief occaſion of the firſt publication of the enſuing Sermon, was becauſe of what is ſaid therein concerning <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> and the reaſons therefor were given in the following manner.—I was educated from a child in the contrary principles to thoſe I now embrace concerning baptiſm; and my education had this to enforce it, that it came from progenitors who were ſundry of them eminently godly, whoſe inſtructions, examples and prayers, I truſt I ſhall bleſs God for to eternity. And after I was bro't to the ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt, I made a public profeſſion in that way; and have ſince been called (though moſt unworthy) to preach the goſpel, and to take the charge of a flock, in which I practiſed <hi>Infant-Baptiſm:</hi> All theſe, and ſome other things concurred to bind me in that way; but the irreſiſtable evidence of divine truth broke through them all. Tho' when this matter was firſt brought in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute among us, I laboured under peculiar diſadvantages, having my mind heavily burthened with a ſenſe of paſt neglect of duty in things of another nature, which at times made me afraid of looking into theſe matters, leſt I ſhould be left of God to embrace an error; and this, together with the hot diſputes, and vehement urgings that we had among us on both ſides, toſſed and <hi>ſiſted</hi> my ſoul moſt terribly; after which I was much over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:011557_0003_0F8721C162EACFF0"/>with melancholy and diſcouragement for a long time. Yet having ſince, through divine mercy, obtained ſweet deliverance and eſtabliſhment, them words have often been with weight upon my mind, <hi>When thou art converted, ſtrengthen thy brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And being ſenſible that many of my brethren are la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring under ſome of the ſame difficulties that I did, and having a view of ſeveral things in this affair, that I have not met with in any human writings, I was inclined to yield to the requeſt of thoſe who deſired that this diſcourſe might be publiſhed.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the reaſons which were given in 1756; and I muſt acknowledge to the glory of God, that its ſucceſs has exceeded my expectation; and ſince the firſt impreſſion was diſpoſed of, it has been often aſked for; and having been repeatedly requeſted to publiſh an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to Mr. <hi>Frothingham</hi>'s letter, I thought I would reprint this, and add that to the end of it. I am far from delighting in controverſy, therefore at firſt I only made a few remarks on his letter, and ſent it to him laſt <hi>July;</hi> but he gave me no ſatisfaction for the miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations he has made of facts, as well as principles. And a chriſtian friend who has been one of his hearers, wrote to me in <hi>October,</hi> that Mr. <hi>F.</hi> would not let him ſee what I had wrote, and deſired I would publiſh it. And now I would commend what I have done to the bleſſing of God, and to the ſerious conſideration of his people.</p>

                  <bibl>
                     <hi>GAL. IV. 31.</hi>
                  </bibl>
                  <p>So then, Brethren, we are not the children of the Bond-woman, but of the Free.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>ALTHOUGH mankind are awfully inclined to diſregard God's law when in a careleſs ſtate, yet when wounded with conviction, inſtead of coming to Chriſt, they fly to the law and their own works for relief. And tho', as one obſerves, man's legal diſpoſition has little need of being encouraged by legal preaching, yet many will teach people in that way; which ſeems to have been the caſe among the <hi>Galatians,</hi> that occaſioned the writing of this epiſtle. It ſeems that ſome teachers had brought in the ſame doctrine there, which before was preached to the diſciples at <hi>Antioch,</hi> namely, that except they were circumciſed and kept the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> they could not be ſaved. Which was then called a <hi>ſubverting their ſouls;</hi> and is now called a <hi>perverting the goſpel of Chriſt.</hi> And the Apoſtle gives them ſmart warnings againſt theſe ſnares, and intimates that the reaſon why they were ſo much inclined to the law, was becauſe they did not hear it, nor know its true nature and ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011557_0005_0F8721C2D96DEEF8"/>And in order to open the caſe plainly to them, he reminds them of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s two ſons which he had, one by a <hi>bond-maid,</hi> the other by a <hi>free-woman;</hi> which he ſhews to be an allegorical repreſentation of the two covenants. And after ſome diſcourſe upon each, he concludes with theſe words, <hi>So then, brethren, we are not the children of the bond-woman, but of the free.</hi> The words may naturally lead us to enquire,—who each of theſe women are, and alſo to look into the characters and condition of their children.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Who is this bond-woman? The Apoſtle anſwers, that it is <hi>Mount</hi> Sinai <hi>in</hi> Arabia, <hi>and anſwereth to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>which now is, and is in bondage with her children,</hi> ver. 25. From that mount both the moral and ceremonial laws were given; and it appears evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that both of them are included here. The ten commands were given from thence, and the firſt tables were broken; the ſecond were put into the ark and there were kept whole; which ſignifies that tho' man broke them, yet they are kept whole in Chriſt; to which ſome reference may be had in Pſalm. 40.7, 8. <hi>Lo I come to do thy will—thy law is within my heart.</hi> This law is ſummed up in love to God, and to our neighbour, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which Jeſus ſaid to the lawyer, <hi>This do, and thou ſhalt live,</hi> Luk. 10.28. Which is the tenor of the old covenant, as appears by Gal. 3.10, 12. From whence we may ſee how univerſal the terms of that covenant are, as to perſons, time and things. <hi>Every one.</hi>—muſt <hi>continue, in all things,</hi>—or he falls under the <hi>curſe.</hi> Hence the Apoſtle's concluſion is certain, to wit, that <hi>as many as are of the works of the law are under the curſe,</hi> becauſe no mere man can fulfil the terms of it.</p>
            <p>That the ceremonial law is alſo included here, under the name of the <hi>bond-woman,</hi> appears not only from its being given at <hi>Sinai</hi> as well as the other, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011557_0006_0F8721C46AB676A8"/>becauſe in this deſcription of her the Apoſtle men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>beggarly elements,</hi> and <hi>days, months</hi> and <hi>years,</hi> with <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as ſhe then was with her children, holding zealouſly to <hi>circumciſion,</hi> ver. 9, 10, 25. &amp; chap. 5, 2. Thoſe inſtitutions of worſhip, and even the ſecond giving of the tables of the moral law, did, as was now obſerved, point to Jeſus Chriſt, but the <hi>Jews</hi> had turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all into works, which creatures muſt <hi>do</hi> in order to be ſaved; in which ſenſe it was a <hi>yoke which neither they nor their fathers were able to bear,</hi> Act. 15.10. And tho' they were <hi>ſhadows of good things to come,</hi> and were ſo improved by antient believers; yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that one deſign of the ceremonial as well as moral law, was more clearly to diſcover to ſelf-conceited and ſelf-righteous man, his polluted and helpleſs condition, and his neceſſity of a Saviour, ſince <hi>thouſands of rams,</hi> or <hi>ten thouſands of rivers of oil</hi> could never take away either the guilt or defilement of his ſin. <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.7, 8. Hence our Apoſtle ſays, <hi>The law entered, that the offence might abound;</hi> and, <hi>it was added becauſe of tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</hi> Rom. 5.20. Gal. 3.19. But inſtead of taking thoſe inſtitutions according to their true deſign, theſe falſe teachers inſiſted upon chriſtians obſerving them as <hi>conditions of being ſaved.</hi> They pretended to preach Chriſt's goſpel, but they clog'd it with <hi>doings</hi> in order to receive, inſtead of <hi>receiving by faith</hi> in order to do; and herein they <hi>perverted the goſpel of Chriſt.</hi> Chap. 1.7. and 3.2. And when any new teſtament inſtitutions or duties are urged now in that line, the goſpel is as much <hi>perverted</hi> as it was then. So that by the bond-woman, I underſtand the covenant of works in general, and all the ways in particular wherein men ſeek life by what they can do, either by duties of morality, or by obſerving any ordinances and forms of worſhip whatſoever.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Let us conſider who her children are, and what a condition they are in.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:011557_0007_0F8721C51DE89208"/>
And here the caſe is very plain that the children of the bond-woman, are all that are <hi>born after the fleſh</hi> (ver. 23.) that is, all mankind in their natural condition. But ſhould any ſay that <hi>Iſhmael</hi>'s being born after the fleſh, intends an unlawful birth, his mother not being <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s lawful wife: I anſwer no, by no means, for then he would have been a baſtard, and ſuch an one muſt not come into the congregation of the Lord, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.— but he was circumciſed and admitted to outward privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges as well as <hi>Iſaac.</hi> This objection might as well be laid againſt four of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s ſons, as againſt this, their mothers being maids or handmaids before; yet they are ever reckoned to make up the twelve tribes of God's <hi>Iſrael.</hi> But it is evident beyond diſpute, that his being born after the fleſh, does not intend a being <hi>illegitimate,</hi> but only that he had no other than a natural birth: he was never <hi>born again,</hi> without which none can enter into the kingdom of God. And ſo now all who have only a natural birth are children of the bond-woman. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays of himſelf, and other ſaints,—<hi>We are by nature, children of wrath, even as others.</hi> Eph. ii. 3. And he tells the <hi>Romans,</hi> that he had proved both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that they are all under ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> iii. 9.—<hi>Jews, Phariſees,</hi> and all the world are guilty before God, ver. 19.</p>
            <p>And never did a child more naturally run to its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for help, than man when wounded with a ſenſe of guilt flies to his own works for relief: his cry is, <hi>Have patience with me, and I'll pay thee all:</hi> but very ſad is the condition of ſuch ſouls. They may juſtly be called children of the bond-woman for theſe reaſons. I. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their work is hard. Slaves have often both hard work to do, and are drove hard in it to do a great deal: ſo is the caſe here: the law requires not only that which is hard, but that which is impoſſible for us to do. It requires us to make us a new heart, and a new ſpirit,

And it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands that we make recompence for all paſt faults, and walk in the ſtatutes of life, without committing iniquity, as we would hope to live. <hi>Ezek.</hi> xxxiii. 15. Yea, it follows the ſoul up ſo, that it ſays, <hi>If thou keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, thou art guilty of all.</hi> Jam. ii. 10. I know ſome ſay that God cannot juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly require of us more than we can do. But this diſcovers men's awful blindneſs. What! is it become an unjuſt thing for this glorious Creditor to demand his full due, becauſe man is turned bankrupt, and is no way able to pay it! (<hi>Luk.</hi> vii. 42.) O heaven-daring madneſs! Nay this ſets aſide all that Chriſt has done as vain, for he came upon this very footing; namely becauſe we were <hi>without ſtrength, therefore in due time he died for the ungodly,</hi> Rom. v. 6. <hi>And what the law could not do.</hi> (i.e. juſtify a ſinner) <hi>God ſent his ſon</hi> to do. <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 3.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Souls under the old covenant are like bond-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in this, that they can claim no right to the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or even to a continuance in the family, but may be turned away, notwithſtanding all that they have done, when the maſter thinks proper.—<hi>The ſervant abideth not in the houſe for ever; but the ſon abideth ever.</hi> Joh. viii. 35. Since the law is broken, man can claim nothing by it, but wrath and damnation. <hi>The law worketh wrath.</hi> (Rom. iv. 15.) <hi>and as many as are of the works of the law, are under the curſe.</hi> Gal. iii. 10. So that after all their performances which they boaſt themſelves in, the ſentence will juſtly be given out, and executed upon them.—<hi>Caſt out the bond-woman and her ſon; for the ſon of the bond-woman, ſhall not be heir with the ſort of the free-woman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Bond-ſervants, when they have toiled and labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many years, are no more releas'd from their bondage, than when they began: ſo all that are under the law, let them faſt twice in the week, and make many and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011557_0009_0F8721C69F5554F0"/>long prayers, and be as exact as ever the <hi>Phariſees</hi> were, in all their walk; yet our Lord aſſures us, that they muſt have a righteouſneſs beyond all this, or they can in no caſe enter into the kingdom of heaven. <hi>Matt.</hi> v. 20.—By the deeds of the law, no fleſh living can be juſtified in the ſight of God. So that every unbeliever, will eternally remain under condemnation after all their doing. Ah! deplorable caſe indeed! well might the apoſtle think that thoſe who deſired to be under the law, did not hear it, nor know its true nature and ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Surely if they did, they would ſoon cry (as <hi>Iſrael</hi> did at <hi>Sinai</hi>) for a mediator to ſtand between God and them.—Hence I proceed,</p>
            <p n="3">III. To ſhew who the <hi>free-woman</hi> is, here ſpoken of. And by this I underſtand, firſt the glorious covenant of grace, made between the Father, and the Son, before the world began. Therefore God ſays, <hi>I have made a covenant with my choſen—I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one choſen out of the people.</hi> Pſal. lxxxix. 3.19. The ſum of which covenant (for I cannot be large in deſcribing of it) is, That the Son of God ſhould aſſume our nature, and in that nature per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly obey the law which we have broken, and bear the puniſhment due unto us for ſin, and ſo make reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for iniquity, and bring in an everlaſting righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, thro' which God could be juſt, and yet the juſtifier of the ungodly:—As the fruit of which, the Father engaged by the influences of the holy Spirit, effectually to draw many of the ſons of men to Chriſt; work faith in their hearts, juſtify and ſanctify their ſouls, and keep them by his power thro' faith unto eternal ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9—17. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.6—8. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9 24. <hi>John</hi> 16.7—13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29, 30. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2—5.</p>
            <p>Which glorious plan, is ſo far from deſtroying, or ſetting aſide the law, that it eſtabliſhes, yea magnfies, and makes it honourable (<hi>Rom.</hi> 3.31. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 42.21.) and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:011557_0010_0F8721CA7B4128B0"/>shews how heinous every breach of it is, even ſo great that no tranſgreſſor of that law could eſcape eternal puniſhment without a perfect ſatisfaction for every of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt it. But by Chriſt's obedience and ſufferings there is a way opened wherein the greateſt ſinner may be pardoned, and God's image be re-inſtamped on his heart, and that he may come to enjoy all divine bleſſings here, and for ever more. Hence the Lord ſays, <hi>This is the covenant that I will make with the houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>after thoſe days;—I will put my laws into their minds, and write them in their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they ſhall be to me a people.</hi> Heb. viii. 10.</p>
            <p>Further, by the free-woman is intended the goſpel-church in her pure ſtanding—Hence in our context ſhe is called <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which is above—which is the mother of us all (ver. 26) So in <hi>Heb.</hi> xii. 18—24. it is ſaid that we <hi>are not come to the mount that burned with fire,</hi> but we <hi>are come to mount</hi> Sion, <hi>and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly</hi> Jeruſalem, — <hi>to the general aſſembly and church of the firſt born, which are written in heaven—and to Jeſus the mediator of the new-covenant, and to the blood of ſprinkling that ſpeaketh better things than that of</hi> Abel.—On mount <hi>Sinai</hi> the fiery law was proclaimed, which gendereth to bondage; but now on mount <hi>Sion,</hi> or in the church of the living God, is proclaimed the goſpel of peace, and ſalvation: and ſouls are brought to embrace the ſame. All the ſaints in heaven and earth, make but one catholic church: but it is in the goſpel church here below that God appears to publiſh his grace, and to draw others in: therefore we are told that, <hi>The law ſhall go forth out of</hi> Zion, <hi>and the word of the Lord from</hi> Jeruſalem, and many nations ſhall flock in, <hi>Iſai.</hi> ii.—And again, <hi>The Lord ſhall ſend the rod of his ſtrength out of</hi> Zion:—the effect of which will be, that his <hi>people ſhall be willing, in the day of his power,</hi> Pſalm.
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011557_0011_0F8721CB70E5AF58"/>cx. 2, 3.—In ſhort, by the free-woman, we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the glorious plan of ſalvation, laid in the eternal mind from everlaſting, which in time has been made manifeſt, firſt by gradual diſcoveries thereof in the old teſtament, and then by Chriſt's actually coming in the fleſh, and working out ſalvation, which he began to preach himſelf, and 'twas afterwards confirmed unto us, by them that heard him, whereby the goſpel church was gathered, and increaſed: His uſual way of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others in, being to cauſe <hi>Zion</hi> to travail, and ſo to bring forth children; for God is the Father, and the church the mother, of all the ſaints.—The Apoſtle here (ver. 27.) adds a paſſage from the 54th of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> where, note, that the foregoing chapter concludes, with the happy fruits of Chriſt's ſufferings, viz. That he ſhould <hi>ſee his ſeed, juſtify many,</hi> &amp;c. upon which the church who had been deſolate as a widow, is comforted with a declaration that her maker is her husband, and that ſhe ſhould have a numerous offspring, and her ſeed ſhould inherit the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> &amp;c.—Which leads us</p>
            <p n="4">IV. To deſcribe the character and ſtate of her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And here we are told, that (as the child of the bond-woman was <hi>born after the fleſh,</hi> ſo) the child of the free-woman was <hi>by promiſe.</hi> God promis'd that ſon to <hi>Abraham</hi> long before he was conceived in the womb; and he exerciſed a ſtrong faith in that promiſe, by which <hi>he gave glory to God.</hi> Rom. 4.20. And 'twas through faith that <hi>Sarah</hi> alſo received ſtrength to conceive this ſeed. <hi>Heb.</hi> xi. 11.—There appeared nothing more than the actings of nature in <hi>Iſhmael</hi>'s birth: but in <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s there was faith on both ſides; which made him a wonderful type of the ſeed here pointed at. He was promiſed before he had a being; and ſo was every child of the free-woman here ſpoken of: They were <hi>choſen in Chriſt, before the world began.</hi> Eph. i. 4. And <hi>God that cannot lie promiſed eternal life,</hi> ſo early. Tit. i. 2. Therefore Chriſt refers
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:011557_0012_0F8721CCD9CCA128"/>to this promiſe, in his glorious prayer, <hi>Joh.</hi> xvii. 1, 2. <hi>Father,—glorify thy Son, that thy Son alſo may glorify thee. As thou has given him power over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eternal life, to as many as thou haſt given him.</hi> But this election of grace is not known to us, 'till we are born again: therefore, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was born ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to promiſe; ſo every one of theſe who are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to Chriſt, ſhall be converted in due time: hence he ſays, <hi>All that the Father giveth me, ſhall come to me: and him that cometh to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> Joh. vi. 37. Such are <hi>born, not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</hi> Joh. i. 13.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſouls may well be called children of the free-woman, becauſe,
<list>
                  <item>1. They are ſet <hi>free</hi> from that condemnation, and dreadful load of guilt which they lay under before. <hi>There is now no condemnation to them which are in Chriſt Jeſus,—for the law of the ſpirit of life, in Chriſt Jeſus, hath made them</hi> free <hi>from the law of ſin and death;</hi> yea <hi>ſo that no things preſent, nor things to come, ſhall ever be able to ſeparate them from his love.</hi> Rom. viii. 1, 2, 38, 39. Agreeable to this is what our divine Maſter tells us, Joh. v. 24. <hi>that he that heareth my word, and believeth on him that ſent me, hath everlaſting life, and ſhall not come into condemnation; but is paſſed from death unto life.</hi>—</item>
                  <item>2. Theſe children are ſet free from ſatan's tyranny. By nature they are his ſlaves: he is called the <hi>prince of this world; and the ſpirit that worketh in the children of diſobedience.</hi> Joh. xii. 31. Eph. ii. 2. Hence we are told that, <hi>Foraſmuch as the children are partakers of fleſh and blood,</hi> Chriſt <hi>took part of the ſame: that through death he might deſtroy him that had the power of death, that is the devil; and deliver them who through fear of death, were all their life-time ſubject to bondage</hi> Heb ii. 14, 15. Chriſt caſteth ſatan out, and takes from him all
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011557_0013_0F8721CD90411648"/>his armour, wherein he truſted, and <hi>divideth the ſpoils.</hi> Luke xi. 22.</item>
                  <item>3. They may be called children of the <hi>free-woman,</hi> becauſe they are made free from the dominion of ſin.— Chriſt tells us that, <hi>Whoſoever committeth ſin, is the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of ſin: but if the Son ſhall make us free, we ſhall be free indeed,</hi> Joh. viii. 34, 36. And <hi>Paul</hi> told the <hi>Romans,</hi> that being made <hi>free from ſin,</hi> they <hi>became the ſervants of God,</hi> had their <hi>fruit unto holineſs, and the end everlaſting life:</hi> yea ſays he, <hi>ſin ſhall not have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over you;</hi> becauſe <hi>ye are not under the law, but under grace,</hi> Rom. vi. 14, 22. Sin takes occaſion by the law, and often beats down, and overcomes ſouls, when they eſſay to reform and turn to the Lord, by throwing their paſt tranſgreſſions and guilt in their way, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting to them, that ſuch guilty creatures as they, can never come to a holy God; and therefore they had better go on and get what pleaſure they can in ſin, for they'll never have any thing better.—And God's own children are often woried here, when they have back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliden from him; and ſatan will not be wanting, to help to keep them back:—hence he is called <hi>the accuſer of the brethren, which accuſeth them before God day and night.</hi>—The ſpirit of God <hi>convinceth</hi> of ſin, and the devil <hi>accuſeth</hi> of ſin; but one ſpecial difference between them lies here,—The one ſhews us our tranſgreſſions in order to awaken us to repentance and reformation, and ſays, <hi>It is high time to awake out of ſleep,</hi> and <hi>the time paſt of our lives may ſuffice, and more than ſuffice, wherein we have ſerved ſin:</hi> but ſatan ſays, 'tis in vain to turn now for there is no help for you. Nay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſouls are got once into his ſnare, he claims a ſort of propriety in them, and if at any time they would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to reprove another for iniquity, he will immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately throw their own faults in their teeth, and tell them that 'tis in vain to pretend to deal with another, when
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:011557_0014_0F8721D4D73734F0"/>they are ſo vile themſelves; and ſo becauſe we have once done <hi>wrong,</hi> he would make <hi>that</hi> a ſufficient argument againſt our ever doing <hi>right</hi> again. O this cruel adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary! how miſerably are ſinners befooled, that they'll hearken to him more than to Jeſus Chriſt!—But what ſhall a poor ſoul do when the tempter throws ſuch things in his way as he knows he is guilty of? he can't deny the charge. Why we are told that <hi>they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; and they loved not their lives unto the death,</hi> Rev. xii. 11. Therefore, O <hi>Soul,</hi> if ſatan tells thee of thy guilt, learn to overcome him by flying immediately to the blood of the Lamb; who, if we confeſs our ſins, is (not only merciful and gracious, but alſo) <hi>juſt and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.9. Does the tempter ſay thy ſins are very heinous? Learn to make that an argument with Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>Pardon O Lord mine iniquity; for it is great,</hi> Pſal. xxv. 11. Which leads me</item>
                  <item>4. To another point of their freedom, which is <hi>open acceſs to God.</hi>—When <hi>Adam</hi> had ſinned, he was turn'd out of Paradiſe, and cherubims; and a flaming ſword were ſet to guard the way of the tree of life, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.24. But now thro' Chriſt we have acceſs by one Spirit to the Father. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.18. Saints have not received the ſpirit of bondage again to fear; but they have received the ſpirit of adoption, whereby they cry <hi>Abba Father,</hi> Rom. 8.15. And they may come with as great freedom as children do to a father, for the bleſſings they need, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.13. Yea, we are bid to be careful for nothing, but in every thing by prayer and ſupplication, with thankſgiving, to let our requeſt be made known to God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.6.—Once more,</item>
                  <item>5. They are made free to ſerve God and walk in his ways ſo that his commands are not a <hi>yoke of bondage;</hi> but a <hi>law of liberty</hi> to their ſouls. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.25. And as
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:011557_0015_0F8721D59C0A7780"/>on the other ſide, the children of the bond-woman drag on like ſlaves, and they ſay of God's ſervice, <hi>what a wearineſs is it?</hi> ſo the children of the free-woman obey him, not out of ſlaviſh dread; (but like free born ſouls) they ſerve him WITHOUT FEAR, in holineſs and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs before him all the days of their lives. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.74.75. Hence <hi>David</hi> reckons it his freedom to obſerve the divine will; ſays he, <hi>I will walk at</hi> LIBERTY: <hi>for I ſeek thy precepts,</hi> Pſal. 119, 45. And the ſaints at <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latia,</hi> being brought into this freedom, the Apoſtle (in the words next after our text) chargeth them to ſtand faſt in that liberty, wherewith Chriſt hath made them free; and not to be entangled again with the yoke of bondage.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>In ſhort, the children of the free-woman are freed from the condemnation of the law, from the power of fin and ſatan, and have freedom of approach to God thro' Jeſus Chriſt; and it is made their freedom and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to walk in holineſs all their days, and they have the liberty of Chriſt's houſe, and have a right to all the privileges of the ſons of God here, and are heirs of an incorruptible inheritance above; and by and by they ſhall be received to that glory: and in the great day, their bodies ſhall be raiſed from the duſt, and ſhall be delivered from the <hi>bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the ſons of God.</hi> Rom. 8.21, 23.—And when the bond-woman, and all her children ſhall be caſt out into outer-darkneſs: then ſhall theſe children of the free-woman be openly received to enjoy the kingdom, prepared for them before the foundation of the world.— <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.—</p>
            <p>Let us now proceed to ſome Improvement of what has been ſaid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>USE</hi> I. We may here ſee the great folly of all thoſe that ſeek ſalvation, either in whole, or in part by their own doings. This mount <hi>Sinai</hi> gendreth to bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:011557_0016_0F8721D66A787F60"/>and thoſe who would get life by the law, let 'em come before it and ſee the darkneſs, fire and ſmoke, and hear the thundrings and the fiery law, that comes from thence. Surely if ſouls come here, they will ſoon ſee the need of a Mediator to ſtand between them and this God, who is a conſuming fire. Alas! how blind are men, that they ſhould ever imagine that they can ſatisfy divine juſtice, or get life by a broken law! <hi>Tell me ye that deſire to be under the law; do you not hear the law?</hi> What does it ſay? Why it ſays, <hi>Iſ the wicked reſtore the pledge, give again</hi> that <hi>he had robbed, walk in the ſtatutes of life</hi> WITHOUT COMMITTING <hi>iniquity, he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not die,</hi> Ezek. 33.15. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the terms well, you muſt reſtore the pledge, give again that you have robbed; not only what you have unlawfully taken from your fellow-men, but alſo what you have done againſt the eternal God; for he ſays, <hi>you have robbed me, even this whole nation,</hi> Mal. 3.9. You muſt fully pay that dreadful debt, and walk in the ſtatutes of life for the future, without ever committing another ſin, elſe there's no life by that law.—If you ſay, that this is too ſtrait; be intreated to look a little farther into the nature of the law, and you will find it is ſo ſtrait, that Heaven and Earth will paſs away, before one tittle of the law can paſs away, 'till all be fulfilled, Matt. 5.18. When God treats with men in the old covenant, he deals with them according to the ſtrict tenor of it: and when he treats with them in the covenant of grace, then tho' their debts are very great, yet, <hi>when they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to pay, he frankly forgives them</hi> all, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.42. But ſinners vainly expect ſome of the bleſſings of grace, while they yet cleave to the law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>USE</hi> II. Hence we may learn who have a right to the privileges of the new covenant: <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe (and thoſe only) who are born again. The children of the free-woman partake of her bleſſings; but the children
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:011557_0017_0F8721D7D2B0ED68"/>of the bond-woman, ſhall not be heirs with the children of the free-woman. I am ſenſible that there are many contentions among profeſſors of religion about theſe things. Many think that ſinners may claim a right to ſome of the <hi>promiſes</hi> of grace: particularly ſuch as theſe —<hi>Aſk and ye ſhall receive, ſeek and ye ſhall find.</hi> And <hi>if any man lack wiſdom, let him aſk of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it ſhall be given him.</hi>—But if they look a little further, they are told that they muſt <hi>aſk in faith,</hi> if they would think to receive any thing from the Lord, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.5, 6, 7.<note n="*" place="bottom">I readily grant that all the bleſſings of grace are held forth to the would by way of <hi>promiſe.</hi> (See Act. 2.39. Gal. 3.14.) But I wonder how any think to claim a right to the promiſe without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving it. The inſtant that the ſinner receives the promiſes as truth, he commences a believer: Hence, the <hi>ſcripture hath concluded all under ſin, that the promiſe by ſaith of Jeſus Chriſt might be given to them that believe.</hi> Gal. 3.22.</note> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed here God appeals to their conſciences, and ſays, <hi>are not my ways equal?</hi> (Ezek. 18.) <hi>are not your ways unequal?</hi> If you keep under the old covenant, I deal with you according to the tenor of it: if you perfectly obey its precepts, you ſhall have the bleſſings promiſed: but he that offends in one point is guilty of all; and then there is <hi>tribulation and wrath upon every ſoul of man that doeth evil,</hi> Rom. 2.9. The promiſes and threatnings of the old covenant belong to the children of the old covenant: and the promiſes of the new covenant belong only to her children. Hence ſuch alone are ſtil'd <hi>heirs of promiſe,</hi> who have <hi>fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope ſet before us,</hi> Heb. 6.17, 18. None others can claim the promiſes of grace, for, <hi>All the promiſes of God</hi> IN <hi>Chriſt Jeſus, are yea, and</hi> IN <hi>him amen,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.20. Therefore to thoſe only that come to, and receive him does he give power (or privilege) to become the ſons of God. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. And if ſons, then heirs, to all the bleſſings of heaven, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17.—And as theſe alone are heirs to thoſe eternal bleſſings; ſo none others have a
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011557_0018_0F8721DA3A24B460"/>right to the ſpecial privileges of Chriſt's houſe here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: this I ſhall enlarge more upon.</p>
            <p>As for preaching, exhortation, &amp;c. God has given them forth in general to the world, and calls all men every where to repent: But ſome imagine that the Lord's ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per was appointed for a converting ordinance; and ſo that unconverted perſons, if moral, ought to come to it. But if it was appointed for converſion, ſurely the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane have as much need of that as any; tho' 'tis evident that this is children's bread, and therefore by no means to be given to dogs. <hi>Matt.</hi> vii. 6. Many others think that Baptiſm is not confined only to ſaints, but that their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural offspring are alſo to partake of it. And I find that the main arguments for both, are fetch'd from the conſtitution of the old-teſtament-church, holding that to be moddled according to the new-covenant:—though here in our context, we are told that, <hi>This Agar is mount Sinai,—and anſwereth to Jeruſalem that now is, and is in bondage with her children:</hi> i. e. the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> church in her legal ſtanding: that church and the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-church are ſet as wide apart as the old covenant and the new. In <hi>Heb.</hi> viii. the covenant at <hi>Sinai,</hi> is called <hi>Old;</hi> and God ſays expreſly that the new-covenant is <hi>not according to</hi> that; and that old conſtitution we are told, was then <hi>ready to vaniſh away,</hi> ver. 9, 13. The original conſtitution of that church was ſuch, that it took in whole houſholds, and ſo a whole nation.—Natural generation (being born of profeſſors of that religion) gave a right to circumciſion, and ſo to all the privileges of that church: And a being bought with an <hi>Hebrews</hi> money, gave the ſervant a right both to circumciſion and the paſſover, <hi>Exod.</hi> xii. 44. And the covenant that <hi>Moſes</hi> mentions in <hi>Deut.</hi> xxix. took in ſuch as had not an <hi>heart to perceive, eyes to ſee,</hi> nor <hi>ears to hear.</hi> But <hi>Paul</hi> ſhews clearly that in the new-teſtament, <hi>The children of the fleſh are not the children of God: but the children

And leſt any ſhould ſay that a being born after the fleſh, meant an unlawful birth, he immediately adds the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>Jacob</hi> &amp; <hi>Eſau,</hi> as exactly parallel, who were not only both born of one mother, but alſo at one time; and yet <hi>Eſau</hi> was in as bad a caſe as <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> ver. 10—13.</p>
            <p>But what will, I apprehend, ſet this matter in the cleareſt light, is to conſider it in the line of <hi>type</hi> and <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titype.</hi> —It is abundantly ſhewn in Scripture, that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> church, and the forms and ordinances thereof, did ſhadow forth, and typify heavenly things, <hi>Heb.</hi> viii. 2—6. and ix. 9, 23.24, &amp;c. The ſeed of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s being ſelected out of other nations, and being redeem'd with almighty power, and bro't near to God, to be his peculiar people, and to partake of thoſe ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and privileges which no other nation then enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, did remarkably ſhadow forth God's ſpiritual <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whom he hath choſen and by almighty grace redeemed; <hi>Out of every kindred, tongue, people and nation.</hi> Rev. v. 9. And as the Lord ſaid to <hi>Iſrael</hi> at <hi>Sinai; Ye ſhall be unto me a kingdom of prieſts, (Exod.</hi> xix. 6.) ſo theſe ſaints ſay, <hi>Thou haſt made us unto our God kings and prieſts,</hi> ver 10. And in the fore-mentioned 9th of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, Paul</hi> evidently ſhews, that as <hi>Iſrael</hi> literally, was choſen out of other people: ſo that <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſpiritually are choſen out, from among both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> The ſame apoſtle calls the old-teſtament diſpenſation the <hi>Letter;</hi> and the new-teſtament, the <hi>Spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. iii. 6. That church had a literal houſe and temple where God's name was fixed, and his worſhip confined, <hi>Deut.</hi> xii. 13. 1 <hi>King.</hi> viii. 29.</p>
            <p>But in the new-teſtament we are confined to no place, (<hi>John</hi> iv. 21) but the <hi>ſaints are God's houſe,</hi> who are <hi>builded for his habitation thro' the ſpirit,</hi> Eph. ii. 20,—22. That old temple was built with ſtones which <hi>Hiram</hi>'s ſervants hewed: but this with <hi>lively</hi> (or living) <hi>ſtones;</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:011557_0020_0F8721DDD316F298"/>that was a <hi>worldly ſanctuary,</hi> (Heb. 9.1.) but this is a <hi>ſpiritual houſe;</hi>—there was offered fleſhly ſacrifices; but here <hi>ſpiritual</hi> ones, acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> ii. 5.—<note n="*" place="bottom">Should any think that my diſecurſe here, too much favours the ſcheme of thoſe who deny the outward uſe of Baptiſm. I reply, that a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons experiencing of this ſpiritually, is ſo far from diſproving the need of the outward uſe of that ordinance, that the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> makes the evidence of perſons being baptized with the Holy Ghoſt, to be a ſufficient proof that ſuch are meet ſubjects <hi>of,</hi> and ought to be baptized <hi>with</hi> water Baptiſm. <hi>Act.</hi> x. 47, 48. and xi. 16. which is ſuch an evidence for our practice, as I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

And here let me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark one thing that is not generally obſerved, and that is, that a ceremonial cleanneſs was particularly requir'd in a child, before he might be circumciſed; which plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appears in the firſt appointment of that ordinance, in that he muſt not be circumciſed 'till eight days old, <hi>Gen.</hi> xvii. 12. The reaſon of which is ſhewn in <hi>Lev.</hi> xii. 2, 3. which is that when a woman had borne a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child, ſhe ſhould be unclean ſeven days; and in the eighth day he ſhould be circumciſed: <hi>i. e.</hi> he muſt be circumciſed as ſoon as he was clean; which by the way proves undeniably, that circumciſion in it's original ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, was deſign'd to be a part of the ceremonial law; notwithſtanding what many ſay to the contrary. Therefore from hence I conclude, that as outward clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was neceſſary in order for circumciſion; and none might partake of it without; ſo that ſpiritual cleanneſs is abſolutely neceſſary now, in order for any to receive Baptiſm, or the Lord's Supper aright.—</p>
            <p>Theſe brief hints may furniſh us with an eaſy anſwer to many objections, that are often urged againſt our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to give theſe precious ordinances to the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:011557_0021_0F8721E30D220F80"/>I ſhall ſpeak more particularly as to Baptiſm, and that will ſufficiently anſwer the other; for none will plead for perſons coming to the Lord's Supper, who have not a right to Baptiſm.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Object. God ſays to <hi>Noah, With thee will I eſtabliſh my covenant</hi>—and <hi>come thou and all thy houſe into the ark,</hi> Gen. vii. 18. And <hi>Peter</hi> tells us that the <hi>like figure whereunto, even baptiſm doth now ſave us, (not the putting away of the filth of the fleſh, but the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of a good conſcience towards God) by the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. iii. 21. Hence we conclude that now, children are taken into covenant with their parents, and they ought to anſwer a good conſcience in having of them baptized.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> That which ſav'd 'em was the ark that <hi>Noah</hi> built, which was a clear type of Chriſt: and as the old world was deſtroy'd when <hi>Noah</hi> enter'd into the ark; ſo ſhall the wicked when the Son of Man cometh for the ſalvation of his people, <hi>Matt.</hi> xxiv. 38, 39. But what is moſtly hinged upon, is <hi>Noah</hi>'s childrens going in, on their father's right. Tho' they were ſav'd only with a temporal ſalvation, which can't entitle to goſpel church-privileges. But what will you do with this here? the diſpute is commonly about <hi>infant baptiſm:</hi> but here is nothing like an infant, for they were all married men and women; <hi>Noah</hi> and his <hi>wife,</hi> and his <hi>ſons</hi> and their <hi>wives:</hi> and where is the perſon in our days that will baptize ſuch, only on their parents right? Thus by jum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling type and antitype together, perſons run themſelves into a ſad <hi>dilemma:</hi> whereas if we take them diſtinct, the caſe is eaſy. <hi>Noah,</hi> as well as the ark he built, did tipify Chriſt: his children were ſaved, ſo are all Chriſt's children: <hi>Noah</hi>'s children went voluntarily into the ark, at God's command, <hi>Gen.</hi> vii 1, 7; ſo muſt each one of us perſonally believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and anſwer a good conſcience towards God in obeying
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:011557_0022_0F8721E31B77AD60"/>his commands; or elſe <hi>Noah, Daniel</hi> nor <hi>Job</hi> can never deliver ſon nor daughter from deſtruction, <hi>Ezek.</hi> xiv. 20.</p>

But the Lord made the covenant of grace with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>I will be a God to thee and to thy ſeed after thee;</hi> and ſo took his ſeed into covenant with himſelf, which is called an <hi>everlaſting covenant;</hi> and as a token thereof, ordered him to circumciſe his children, <hi>Gen.</hi> xvii. So we believe that now children are in covenant with their parents, and ought to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized: —hence <hi>Peter</hi> ſays on the day of penticoſt, to thoſe who were pricked to the heart, <hi>Repent and be baptized,—for the promiſe is unto you, and your children.</hi> Acts ii. 39.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is the main hinge on which all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy turns; therefore I will be a little more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular upon it. And firſt let us obſerve that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſtood in a double capacity.—As he ſtood perſonally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, the covenant of grace was no more made with him, than with any ſaint in the world. The goſpel was preached unto him, (<hi>Gal.</hi> iii. 8.) and he believed it, and it was counted unto him for righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> iv. 3.— But as he ſtood a type of Chriſt, he appear'd as the viſible head of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, and the covenant was made with him, and his ſeed after him, and they were all taken into the church, and many favours were granted, or promiſed to them,—Nextly, let us examine who his <hi>ſeed</hi> are: and here I find that his ſeed is taken in three ſenſes in ſcripture.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. His natural ſeed, which includes all that deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his loins: Theſe were all taken into that ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical covenant; and they had the privilege of the oracles of God, and the outward ordinances of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which no other nation then enjoy'd: they had the promiſe of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and of many outward bleſſings there; and in concluſion that Chriſt ſhould
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:011557_0023_0F8721E613C71858"/>come out of that nation;—and they had the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation of the goſpel <hi>Rom.</hi> iii. 1, 2, and 9, 4, 5.</item>
               <item>2. Chriſt is <hi>Abraham's</hi> ſeed, <hi>in whom all the families of the earth ſhall be bleſſed.</hi> Gal. iii. 16. and ſundry of them ancient promiſes evidently point directly to him, in whom alone they are fulfilled.</item>
               <item>3. All ſaints are <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſpiritual children.— <hi>Therefore it is of ſaith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promiſe might be ſure to all the ſeed, not to that only which is of the law, but to that alſo which is of the faith of</hi> Abraham, <hi>who is the father of us all,</hi> Rom. iv. 16. Now as to theſe ſeed, God is indeed their God in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which covenant and the bleſſings of it are ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting. But then take notice that, though all ſaints are <hi>Abraham's children,</hi> yet they are not all made <hi>fathers</hi> as he was. He is the father of us all; and they that be of faith are his children. <hi>Gal.</hi> iii. 7. As he ſtood the head and father of that nation and church, he was as has been obſerved, a type of Chriſt who is our <hi>everlaſting father.</hi> (<hi>Iſa.</hi> ix. 6.) and is <hi>head over all things to his church.</hi> (Eph. i. 22.) In which ſenſe no meer man upon earth now ſtands as <hi>Abraham</hi> did.—Now if we take theſe things diſtinct, there is no difficulty; but to jum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them together, leads into endleſs confuſion.— Typically, all <hi>Abraham</hi>'s poſterity were in covenant, both believers and unbelievers: and anti-typically all his ſpiritual ſeed are in the covenant of grace, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Rom. iv. 11, 12. And ſo that text is limited in <hi>Act.</hi> ii. 39. which is ſo much inſiſted upon. <hi>The promiſe is unto you and to your children, and to all that are afar off,</hi> EVEN as MANY <hi>as the Lord our God ſhall call.</hi> There is the limits; as many of us, and of our children as are effectually called, are <hi>heirs of promiſe,</hi> and no others <hi>Heb.</hi> vi. 17, 18. and ix. 15. And to cut this matter ſhort, we in general don't pretend to be <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural ſeed; then ſhew me if you can, how
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:011557_0024_0F8721E6E04C9DA0"/>the natural ſeed of believing <hi>Gentiles</hi> as ſuch, ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſpiritual children: <hi>that which is born of the fleſh, is fleſh:</hi> and how came thoſe who are only your fleſhly poſterity, any way to be <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſeed?— If you ſay that you are <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſeed, and they ſtand to you, as his did to him.—Then let me enquire where God has ſhewn you that you ſhall be a father of many nations, and that a church ſhall ſpring from you which ſhall be large, and that <hi>natural,</hi> inſtead of <hi>ſpiritual</hi> birth ſhall bring perſons into it? Here lies the pinch of the point; a being born after the fleſh did bring them into the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> church, which is evident becauſe, if they were not circumciſed, they muſt be cut off from their people. (<hi>Gen.</hi> xvii. 14.) which could not be if they were not in; for there is no caſting any out of the church that are not in it. Which if it be the caſe now under the goſpel, then we have a fleſhly and not a ſpiritual church, directly contrary to many texts that I have mentioned, and ſcores more that might be bro't to the ſame purpoſe.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Here ſome bring <hi>Rom.</hi> xi. to prove that the limits of the church ſtand the ſame now as formerly, only is changed into different hands. Becauſe from a ſimilitude of the <hi>olive-tree,</hi> is repreſented the rejection of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the reception of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to partake of that which is called the <hi>root and fatneſs of the olive-tree;</hi> which they take to be a partaking of the ſame, or like, external, as well as internal privileges: from whence is argued the right of profeſſors now to baptize their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> circumciſed theirs.—But by the root and olive-tree, I underſtand, <hi>Abraham</hi> typically, and Chriſt ſpiritually, who is plainly pointed at in ver. 26, 27. He <hi>is the vine,</hi> his people <hi>are the branches.</hi> (Joh. xv. 5.) The <hi>Jews</hi> were broken off thro' unbelief, and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were graffed in, and ſtand only by <hi>faith,</hi> ver. 20. So that what appears from hence is, that true faith is abſolutely neceſſary, in order for any ſoul now
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:011557_0025_0F8721E7A17834F0"/>to partake of theſe great bleſſings, deſcribed by the root and fatneſs of the olive; which bleſſings the <hi>Jews</hi> loſt by unbelief, tho' it is called <hi>their own olive-tree,</hi> ver. 24. and they had the firſt offer of grace when Chriſt came.—</p>
            <p>Therefore whatever privileges are intended by the root and fatneſs of the olive, it is evident that as the branch muſt have a living union to the tree, or vine, in order to receive nouriſhment therefrom; ſo every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, both great and ſmall, muſt by faith be united to Chriſt, in order to partake of them favours: which ſhews, that no arguments can be drawn from hence to prove that any others are ſubjects of bapſtiſm but real ſaints.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 3. But it is evident that in old time, God did grant to the children of thoſe who were eminently god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, many favours and privileges that he did not to others: and ſo the prophet ſpeaking concerning the laſt times, tells the ſaints that they ſhall be <hi>the ſeed of the bleſſed of the Lord, and their off spring with them,</hi> Iſa. lxv. 23. and there is much more in ſcripture to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; from whence we cannot but think, that children now are taken into covenant with their parents, and therefore have a right to baptiſm.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The firſt part of this objection is undoubted truth, but the conſequence drawn from it, I think has no foundation in ſcripture: for a great part of the favours thus granted, are only of a temporal na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and that not only to children, but alſo to other friends round. Thus for inſtance, not only <hi>Noah</hi>'s and <hi>Lot</hi>'s children were ſaved from being drowned and burnt up: but <hi>Rahab</hi> the harlot's father and mother, brothers and ſiſters, alſo were preſerved from being ſlain, for her ſake, becauſe ſhe received the ſpies with peace. <hi>Joſh.</hi> ii. 13. and 6.23.24.— and how often does God ſpeak of preſerving the kingdom, and the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of it, in the hands of the poſterity of <hi>David</hi> his
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:011557_0026_0F8721E854E8E3D8"/>ſervant, for their fathers ſake. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11.13, 32, 34, 36. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.7. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 37.35. So that it appears that a great part of the favours thus given, are of a temporal nature, which no ways entitles to goſpel church privileges:—If it did, parents or brethren of the godly might claim a right to them, as well as children, Yet.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If any ſpiritual favours are ſhewn to children for their parents ſake, they are either the advantage of their godly examples, counſels and inſtructions, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the outward means of grace, (<hi>chiefly becauſe unto them are committed the oracles of God.</hi> Rom. iii.—) Or elſe out of regard to his ſaints, and in anſwer to their prayers, the Lord is pleas'd to power out his ſpirit on them, and ſavingly turn 'em to himſelf: then we readily own that they have a right to all the privileges of the ſons of God.—<hi>I will pour out my ſpirit upon thy ſeed, and my bleſſing upon thine off-ſpring:</hi>—What then is the conſequence? why, <hi>one ſhall ſay, I am the Lord's: and another ſhall call himſelf by the name of</hi> Jacob: <hi>and another ſhall ſubſcribe with his hand unto the Lord, and ſir-name himſelf by the name of</hi> Iſrael. <hi>Iſai.</hi> xliv. 3, 5. Note, firſt God's ſpirit is pour'd upon 'em, and then they openly confeſs him. But what proof is there from hence, that unconverted children have a right to church privileges? The Lord in comforting Zion, in Iſa. liv. 13. ſays, <hi>All thy children ſhall be taught of God:</hi> which chapter the apoſtle quotes in our context, to deſcribe the free-woman; and then adds, <hi>We, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren are her children:</hi> all which ſhews, that the churches children in a goſpel ſenſe, are only real ſaints. The ſame appears alſo from what God ſaid to <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> concerning the new covenant, that he would make with his people: not according to the covenant that he made with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they came out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> which new covenant, is a writing his law in their hearts, &amp;c. and in deſcribing the extent of it, he ſays, <hi>They ſhall all
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:011557_0027_0F8721EA83992480"/>know me, from the leaſt of them, unto the greateſt of them, ſaith the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity; and I will remember their ſin no more.</hi> From which it is evident to a demonſtration, that none are actually in the covenant, but ſuch as know God, and have their ſins forgiven. This is applied to the goſpel-ſtate in <hi>Heb.</hi> viii.</p>
            <p>Further let it be obſerved, that this point, of favours being ſhewn to children for their godly parents ſake, was no ways confined to circumciſion of old, becauſe, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears before, in the time, and after that was inſtituted.— <hi>Before,</hi> it appeared in <hi>Noah</hi>'s family, as obſerved above. —<hi>In the time</hi> of it, we may ſee the ſame in <hi>Lot</hi>'s houſe, and that not only to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </gap> immediate offspring, but alſo many generations after, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </gap> ſhews ſome regard to his poſterity for his ſake, <hi>Deur.</hi> ii. 9, 19. Yet none of them were circumciſed.—And <hi>after</hi> circumciſion was inſtitut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the ſame appears without any ſpecial refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to that, as may be ſeen in the family of <hi>Phinehas, David,</hi> and others, though all the reſt of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were circumciſed as well as they: which proves that God's beſtowing ſome favours on ſaints children, that he didn't to others of old, never could argue any right to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, without an expreſs command: then ſurely no proof can from hence be drawn for baptizing believers ſeed now, without the plain direction of the lawgiver.</p>
            <p>Object. 4. According to this, you make as tho' ſaints in goſpel-times have not ſo great privileges as they had under the law: but we believe them to be greater now than then.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. In order to ſolve this difficulty, 'tis neceſſary to conſider what were truly the privileges that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd under the law. And <hi>Paul</hi> plainly ſhews that their chief privileges were the enjoyment of the oracles of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> iii. 1, 2. which were as means for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and ſalvation: and that they might not partake
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:011557_0028_0F8721ECA0DB06A8"/>of theſe means without being circumciſed is manifeſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that Chriſt himſelf when he ſent out his apoſtles before he had by his death aboliſhed the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, forbid their preaching to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> or <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans,</hi> but only ot the loſt ſheep of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Matt. x. 5, 6. But now our children may enjoy theſe means with vaſtly greater clearneſs than they, without being baptized.—</p>
            <p>Should any here ſay that Baptiſm is a means for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and as ſuch ought to be uſed for children. I reply, that I conceive this was the footing upon which the baptizing of infants was firſt introduced into the world: tho' I don't pretend to be much acquainted with the hiſtory of thoſe times, yet I gather this from the account that <hi>Paedobaptiſts</hi> themſelves give of this affair. Mr. <hi>Clark</hi> in his late defence of the divine right of Infant-Baptiſm; though he can produce no expreſs mention of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> being baptized in the two firſt hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years after Chriſt; yet he would perſuade us that the fathers of the third century had the apoſtles minds and practice right in this matter, who plainly mention it. But one of the firſt paſſages that he cites is from St. <hi>Origen</hi> in theſe expreſſions, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q>It is for that reaſon becauſe by the ſacrament of Baptiſm the <hi>pollution of our birth is taken away,</hi> that infants are baptized.</q> P. 111. And hence they frequently called Baptiſm, <hi>rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration:</hi> which language the church of <hi>England</hi> retain to this day. But if all were regenerated who are ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in infancy, ſurely we ſhould ſee other men of them, than multitudes of them appear to be. And the notion of the pollution of our births being waſhed away by this outward application of water, looks ſo abſurd, that I would perſwade myſelf that 'tis needleſs among us to ſtand to confute it.—Were it needful. what the noted Mr. <hi>Joſeph Allen</hi> (a <hi>Paedobaptiſt</hi>) in his alarm to the unconverted, P. 10. lays down, is ſomewhat to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:011557_0029_0F8721ECD3B39C10"/>Says he, <q>It is not the end of Baptiſm to rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, 1. Becauſe then there would be no reaſon why it ſhould be confined only to the ſeed of believers, for both the law of God, and the nature of charity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires us to uſe the means of converſion for all, as far as we can have opportunity. Were this true no ſuch charity as to care the children of the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> and baptize them, and diſpatch them to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out of hand like the bloody wretches that made the poor proteſtants (to ſave their lives) ſwear they would come to <hi>Maſs,</hi> and that they would never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from it, and then put them forthwith to death, ſaying, <hi>They would hang them while in a good mind.</hi> 2. Becauſe it pre-ſuppoſeth regeneration, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can't be intended to confer it. In all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs inſtances in ſcripture, we find that Baptiſm doth ſuppoſe their repenting, believing receiving the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Act.</hi> viii. 37. &amp; ii. 38. &amp; x. 37. <hi>Mark</hi> xvi. 16.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I alſo obſerve in Mr. <hi>Clark</hi> that there is as early mention of <hi>Godfathers,</hi> and <hi>Godmothers</hi> as there is of infants right to Baptiſm. P. 105. He likewiſe ſpeaks of a diſpute that after roſe among the churches whether infants might be baptized as ſoon as they were born, or not till eight days old: which affair was ſettled by a council in <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time. All which make me think that inſtead of having this pattern from the apoſtles, theſe things were introduced gradually among many other corruptions of thoſe times.</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. If you think we muſt have as many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ordinances of worſhip as they of old, or elſe that our privileges are leſs, you are greatly miſtaken, for 'tis juſtly reckoned a great favour to have that large <hi>hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing of ordinances taken out of the way.</hi> Col. ii. 14. The <hi>Jews</hi> had three ſtated <hi>feaſts</hi> in which all their Males were to appear before God. (<hi>Deut.</hi> xvi. 16.) But there is but one ſtated ordinance in the goſpel-church
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:011557_0030_0F872246D319F808"/>which is ſo called. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 8. and who will ſay that our privileges are leſs than the <hi>Jews</hi> becauſe of that? Much of the glory of that church was out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward (as of circumciſion the Lord ſays, <hi>My covenant ſhall be in your fleſh.</hi> Gen. xvii. 13.) and they had a great deal of outward ſplendor:—in particular their temple built by <hi>Solomon,</hi> doubtleſs far ſurpaſſed any houſe that any goſpel-church now on earth have to meet in: yet that don't prove our privileges to be leſs than theirs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 3. <hi>Aaron</hi> was choſen God's high-prieſt of old, and then the prieſthood was limitted to his natural ſeed; and the Lord ſays of his grandſon <hi>Phinehas, Behold I give unto him my covenant of peace: and he ſhall have it, and his ſeed after him, even the covenant of an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting prieſthood; becauſe he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the children of Iſrael.</hi> Num. xxv. 12, 13. Now mark—here is an <hi>everlaſting cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> made with <hi>Phinehas,</hi> as well as with <hi>Abraham;</hi> but who will ſay, that goſpel miniſters privileges are leſs now, than thoſe miniſters of God's ſanctuary were then; unleſs the miniſtry may now be limited to their natural poſterity? A part of the prieſts work was to <hi>teach Jacob God's Judgments, and Iſrael his law.</hi> (Deut. xxxiii. 10.) which is the work of goſpel-miniſters now. Natural birth, and ſome outward ceremonies then bro't perſons into the church, and into the prieſthood: but now ſpiritual birth, and the work of God's grace is neceſſary, in order to bring ſouls aright, into the church and into the miniſtry. As to both, it then ran in a <hi>natural,</hi> but now in a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> line: and there is every whit as much reaſon to plead that miniſters in theſe times, muſt have all their off-ſpring maintained by the offerings of the people; and that none may come into the miniſtry, but their ſeed; (<hi>Deut,</hi> xviii. 1—5.) or elſe their privileges are cut ſhort; as to ſay, that church-members now muſt
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:011557_0031_0F87224794CD1E78"/>have all their children baptized, to prevent a complaint of their privileges being abridg'd.</p>
            <p>What has been ſaid may be ſufficient to anſwer that objection that is often urged, <hi>viz.</hi> That children were once in covenant, and where were they cut off? For they were only in a typical covenant, as has been ſhewn: But when <hi>John</hi> the baptiſt came to prepare the way for the evangelical adminiſtration, he told the <hi>Jews</hi> to think no more about having <hi>Abraham</hi> to their father; for God was able of ſtones to raiſe up children unto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi> q.d. <hi>Abraham</hi>'s children are now to be reckoned in another line; therefore think no more of having a right to ordinances, only by virtue of natural generation. And he plainly ſhews that evidences of repentance are neceſſary now in order for any to partake of baptiſm; <hi>Matt.</hi> 3.8, 9. So that unconverted children were only in that old covenant, which was then <hi>ready to vaniſh away</hi> (Heb. 8.13.) None are in the new-covenant, 'till God's law is writen in their hearts (ver. 10.) and ſuch never can be cut off.</p>
            <p>Neither will there need much more to be ſaid upon the diſtinction that is made between the external admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration and internal efficacy of the covenant. This Mr. <hi>Clark</hi> inſiſts much upon<note n="*" place="bottom">In his anſwer to Dr. <hi>Gill,</hi> on infant baptiſm; I will recite ſome of his words, p. 246. He ſays, <q>A man may be in the covenant of grace, in reſpect of its viſible adminiſtration—and yet he may not be in the covenant of grace in regard of it's ſpiritual diſpenſation and efficacy. This is the caſe of all <hi>cloſe</hi> hypocrites, p. 248. The inviſible church conſiſts of all, and only real Saints.—all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of this inviſible church, it will be granted, are in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, in regard of its ſpiritual efficacy.</q> And further on he declares, that <q>Chriſt hath promiſed ſalvation to thoſe <hi>only</hi> who believe in their hearts, as well as confeſs with their mouths, p. 149.</q> And now what place has Mr. <hi>Clark</hi> got in the church to put children in, before they believe? I confeſs I can ſee none but only along with hypocrites, to whom he acknowledges Chriſt has <hi>not promiſed</hi> ſalvation, but to thoſe <hi>only</hi> who believe in their hearts; and if it be a very great privilege to be in ſuch a place, then he may have ſome colour for complaining of our cutting children off from ſome valuable privilege, by not baptizing of them before they are</note>: And he owns that none
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:011557_0032_0F87224C0078AE88"/>are in the covenant in the latter ſenſe, but real ſaints; but their children were in the former external admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, and ſo he thinks they are now. But if the former adminiſtration was <hi>typical,</hi> and the latter <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,</hi> as has been ſufficiently ſhewn; and if he is not now a <hi>Jew,</hi> which is one <hi>outwardly;</hi>—but that he only is a <hi>Jew</hi> which is one <hi>inwardly;</hi> and if now circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion is that of the <hi>heart,</hi> in the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and not in the <hi>letter,</hi> whoſe praiſe is not of men, but of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28, 29. then ſurely there is no more place here for children, than any others, till their hearts are chang'd.</p>
            <p>And a few words may alſo ſuffice to confute the argument that is fram'd from the ſimilitude of a king's giving out a patent, or grant of land, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain privileges, to a number of perſons, and their heirs, ſealed with red wax; and afterwards ſhould call it in, and put a new ſeal, in white wax to the ſame patent: that in ſuch a caſe there would be no need of expreſſing anew, who were intereſted in it. From whence is argued that 'tis the fame covenant and grant that believers have now, which was given to <hi>Abraham,</hi> only that was ſeal'd with a red or bloody ſeal, and this with a white one<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi>'s dialogue on infant-baptiſm.</note> But, (to uſe this way of ſpeaking) the difference appears vaſtly great, for the old patent to <hi>Abraham</hi> contained a promiſe of a numerous off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, that he ſhould be a father of many nations, and kings ſhould come out of his loins, that they ſhould be God's viſible covenant people, and they ſhould have the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> for an everlaſting poſſeſſion, (<hi>Gen.</hi> xvii. 2—8. The head and capital of which country was <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>—Whereas the new patent is given to Jeſus Chriſt the antetype of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which is juſtly called <hi>a better covenant, eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes,</hi> Heb. viii. 6. He has the promiſe of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then for his inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:011557_0033_0F87224C1380D028"/>earth for his poſſeſſion; and all that can claim a right to the bleſſings of this teſtament, are ſuch as are effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>called:</hi> ſuch have the promiſe of a better land than the old <hi>Canaan</hi> ever was, even an <hi>eternal inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> Heb. ix. 15. The old patent promiſed that <hi>ſome</hi> of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s poſterity ſhould be made <hi>kings;</hi> but this new one makes <hi>all</hi> Chriſt's ſeed <hi>kings,</hi> as well as <hi>prieſts</hi> to God; who ſhall reign, not for a few years only, but for ever and ever, <hi>Rev.</hi> i. 6. and xxii. 25. The royal ſeat of them old kings, was Jeruſalem be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; which in <hi>Paul</hi>'s time was in <hi>bondage with her children:</hi> but theſe kings ſhall reign in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that is above, and is <hi>free, which is the mother of us all.</hi>— They of old were God's covenant people for a while, yet afterwards for their breaking his covenant, he ſays, he <hi>regarded them not,</hi> (Heb. viii. 9. But thoſe that are in this new covenant, <hi>There is nothing preſent nor to come, that ſhall ever ſeparate them from the love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord,</hi> Rom. viii.— And as the articles in theſe two teſtaments are very different one from the other; ſo, ſhould we ſuppoſe (but not grant) theſe external ordinances to be <hi>ſeals,</hi> yet there is a great difference between them alſo. For,

                  <item>1. Circumciſion was only for the males; baptiſm is both for males and females.</item>
                  <item>2. Circumciſion might be adminiſtered by common perſons: <hi>Moſes</hi>'s wife circumciſed his ſon, (<hi>Exod.</hi> iv. 25.) and <hi>Zechariah</hi>'s neighbours came to circumciſe <hi>John, Luke</hi> i. 58, 59.—But Baptiſm is to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred only by Chriſt's meſſengers, <hi>Matt.</hi> xxviii. 19, 20.</item>
                  <item>3. Circumciſion was not to be adminiſtred 'till eight days old; but baptiſm was no other age fixed than only, if they believe with all the heart, they may be baptized, <hi>Acts</hi> viii. 37.</item>
                  <item>4. Circumciſion bound them to obſerve all thoſe le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal ceremonies, which baptiſm, does not, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.—</item>

5. Circumciſion was a type of what ſhould come, even of Chriſt's being cut off, and alſo of regeneration; <hi>Col.</hi> ii. 11. Whereas baptiſm is not a type of what is to come; but is an outward ſign or manifeſtation of what is inwardly wrought. <hi>As many as are baptized into Chriſt</hi> HAVE <hi>put on Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3.27.—Here lies one ſpecial difference between the ordinances of the old teſtament, and the new. Old teſtament ordinances were typical of what was to come: whereas the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the new, are open declarations of what is actually done. Thus for inſtance, in the Lord's ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, we do <hi>ſhew forth the Lord's Death:</hi> or from time to time, hold up a publick witneſs to the world that Chriſt has really died for ſinners; and this we are to continue in the practice of, till his ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. 26.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Hence we may ſee the reaſon, why thoſe might be the ſubjects of circumciſion, that may not of baptiſm, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe that pointed forward to what was to be, and ſo might be adminiſtred to ſubjects who had not the thing typified, wrought in their hearts: but bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is not a type that the ſubjects ſhall be converted; but an open ſign or witneſs that they are ſo; and thus the worthy ſubject in attending that ordinance declares, that he has been <hi>crucified with Chriſt, and is made dead unto ſin and alive unto God, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> Rom. vi.—</p>
            <p>This view I conceive may give us a true idea of that text which is conſiderably uſed in this affair, <hi>Rom.</hi> iv. 11. <hi>And he received the ſign of circumciſion, a ſeal ef the righteouſneſs of the faith.</hi>—From whence many conclude, that the covenant of circumciſion was the pure covenant of grace: and that circumciſion then, and baptiſm now are ſeals thereof. But you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that what the apoſtle is upon, is proving that great point of our juſtification by faith alone; and he
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:011557_0035_0F8722534F502A80"/>brings in the inſtance of <hi>Abraham</hi> as an evidence in the caſe, and ſhews that he was juſtified by faith, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the deeds of the law. Upon this there ariſes another queſtion, which is, Whether this great bleſſing comes only on the circumciſion, or on others alſo? to decide which he takes a review of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s caſe; from whence it appears that <hi>Abraham</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was juſtified by faith, long before circumciſion was inſtituted. <hi>And he received the ſign of circumciſion, a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of the faith which he had, yet being uncircumciſed.</hi>—</p>
            <p>Circumciſion (as has been ſhewn) was a ſign of what was to come; but <hi>Abraham</hi> had the thing ſignified then wrought in his ſoul; ſo that he had both the type and antetype, and thus it was to him a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of the faith which he then had. But how could it be a ſeal to <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and thouſands of others of the righteouſneſs of the ſaith which they had not?— The apoſtle from hence goes on to ſhew that thus ſtanding, <hi>Abraham</hi> was a father to all that believ'd, tho' not circumciſed: and a father to thoſe of the <hi>Jews</hi> that were not only circumciſed, but alſo walked in the ſame ſaith that he had before he was circumciſed; which brings out juſt the ſame thing, that has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved before, <hi>viz.</hi> that typically he was father of all that church, both believers and unbelievers, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually he is the father of all the ſaints, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> And without this diſtinction it ſeems im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to reconcile many paſſages of ſcripture to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>Before I diſmiſs this point, I would ſhew ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the abſurdities and entanglements which follow, upon holding, that all the ſaints natural ſeed now are in convenant with them, according to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. This leaves men at a loſs how large the church is; and who have a right to its ordinances. Some
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:011557_0036_0F87225396ADADE8"/>hold, that church members ſhould baptize both their children and their ſervants; only it muſt be ſuch as are young: yet then they can never tell exactly, what age to fix—Numbers there are, who inſiſt upon all baptized children's coming to the Lord's Supper at ſixteen years old, if not openly ſcandalous: but moſt of the firſt Settlers of <hi>New-England,</hi> would receive none to the Supper, but ſuch as they counted godly, and would baptize no children, but only where one of the parents were church-members; yet when theſe children were grown up, they began to plead that they were in covenant, and therefore muſt have their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren baptized; or elſe they would be like heathens: and ſo by degrees they got into the practice of admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch to own the covenant (as 'tis call'd) and have their children baptized, who did not think themſelves fit to come to the Lord's Supper: which ſeems to bring in a ſort of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> or half way between the church and the world. This has been renounced by many in the preſent day, who ſtill hold to infant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſin: tho' other godly and learned men when they have owned ſome ſcruple in the caſe, yet have ſaid, "What ſhall we do? they are in the covenant who have been baptized, and how can we deny them the privileges?"—Others ſay that though children bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, have not a right to the ſupper, nor to bring their ſeed to baptiſm, till converted; yet they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the watch and care of the church, and if they are found obſtinate tranſgreſſors, they muſt be diſciplin'd and caſt out. But we are commanded in any wiſe to rebuke our neighbour, and not ſuffer ſin upon him; and to reprove even the unfruitful works of darkneſs, and would you caſt them out from this? that is a great length indeed.</p>
            <p>Now all theſe profeſs to hold to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s covenant, and that they will ſhew themſelves to be his children
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:011557_0037_0F87225455F254F8"/>by doing his works; and yet there is not one of them all, that come up to what they profeſs: for <hi>Abraham</hi> circumciſed himſelf, his ſon &amp; all the MEN of his houſe; of which were 3, 8 trained ſoldiers, <hi>Gen.</hi> xvii. 23. and xiv. 14. But theſe ſeveral ſorts of perſons diſcover ſomething in the new-teſtament that contradicts ſo large a practice as that,—therefore they take a part of it; ſome a greater part, and others leſs, according as it appears cleareſt to them.—The chief reaſon of all this confuſion, I conceive to be men's jumbling the conſtitution of the old teſtament church, and the new together: whereas if we take them diſtinct, the limits of each are expreſt very plain. The limits of the old church are expreſt as plain by <hi>Moſes,</hi> as they were to <hi>Abraham.</hi>—If any man would join with that church and come to the paſſover, he muſt have all his males circumciſed: and every man's ſervant, bought with money, when he was circumciſed, then ſhould he eat the paſſover. A foreigner and an hired ſervant might not eat thereof: but all the congregation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould keep it, <hi>Exod.</hi> xii. 44,—48. There are the bounds ſet exactly; and as plain are they in the new-teſtament. He that believeth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved.—They that gladly received the word were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; and the ſame day were added to the church: and they continued in her fellowſhip.—And the Lord added to the church daily, ſuch as ſhould be ſaved, <hi>Mark</hi> xvi. 16. <hi>Acts</hi> ii. 41,—47.—All who by <hi>birth</hi> or <hi>purchaſe</hi> were incorporated into an <hi>Hebrew</hi>'s family, had a right to all the ordinances of that church:—So all that by Chriſt's <hi>purchaſe</hi> and the <hi>new-birth,</hi> are brought into the <hi>houſhold of God,</hi> have a right to all the privileges of the goſpel church, <hi>Eph.</hi> ii. 19,—22. And to vary a ſtep from this, leads men into a jum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and rather than yield the caſe, they will ſay, that the ſcriptures have left this matter in the dark, about
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:011557_0038_0F872255AE8DA9E0"/>the ſubjects of baptiſm: when in truth all the darkneſs is in their own minds.</p>
            <p>Let none improve any of theſe things, to leſſen their obligations of diſcharging their duty faithfully towards their children's ſouls as well as bodies. I believe that thoſe to whom God hath given children, ought to give them up to him again, acknowledging their obligations to bring them up in his ways; and let us bring them to Chriſt for his bleſſing as they did of old. But ſome ſay, <q>How can we bring them to him, but in the way of his ordinances? We know not how to bring them to him but by baptizing of them, as the ſeal of our faith.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Sick perſons were then frequently brought to Chriſt as well as children: and can't you find a way now to bring your ſick to Chriſt either publickly or privately without baptizing of them? ſurely you can.— And ſince there is no more hint of bapſtiſm in one caſe, than the other, I think you may raiſe as good an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from hence, for having baptiſm adminiſtred as a ſeal of your faith in bringing your <hi>ſick</hi> to Chriſt, as your <hi>children.</hi> If it be urged that Chriſt ſays, <hi>Of ſuch is the kingdom of God.</hi> I reply, that he does not ſay <hi>all</hi> ſuch, but <hi>of</hi> ſuch is the kingdom of God: and he immediately adds (both in <hi>Mark</hi> x. 15. and <hi>Luk.</hi> xviii. 17.) an aſſertion that, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he ſhall not enter therein.</hi> Which ſeems to relate rather to the <hi>tempers,</hi> than to the <hi>perſons</hi> of little children. But let all who have an intereſt at the throne of grace, improve it for their children as well as others: and alſo uſe all their endeavours with them to bring them to know God, through Jeſus Chriſt: and when once there appears evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their being in ſuch a happy condition, then let them be as ſmall as they will, it is readily granted that they have a right to all the privileges of the ſons of God.</p>

               <hi>USE</hi> III. What has been ſaid may lead us to an examination of our condition. Since all the world is divided into two families, as Chriſt ſays, <hi>He that is not for us, is againſt us;</hi> ſo here, all are children either of the bondwoman, or the free. Then ſurely 'tis of infinite importance for each ſoul to know which mother they belong to: and the ſcriptures have given many plain marks whereby we may come to know how our caſe is.—For brevity's ſake I ſhall inſtance in but one, which is that, <hi>If thou art a child of the free woman, it is become thy</hi> LIBERTY <hi>to walk in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</hi> Herein lies a ſpecial difference between the leaſt chriſtian and the greateſt hypocrite in the world. Both of them pay ſome regard to the ſame commands, and in many things their external walk may appear alike: but then the ſprings and motives of their obedience are vaſtly different. The hypocrite ſometimes does things to be ſeen of men, tho' what moſt commonly moves him, is fear of hell if he neglects duty, and hopes of eſcaping it by his performances. Hence you'll often hear them pleading, that 'tis dangerous for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be too confident; and that 'tis needful al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to have ſome fear of miſcarrying at laſt, leſt we ſhould grow remiſs and careleſs in duty; and ſome will plainly ſay, that if the doctrine which many hold concerning perſeverance and aſſurance is true, and if they knew that they were in Chriſt, and ſhould never periſh, they would not care how they lived, for all would end well at laſt. But how plainly do theſe men diſcover themſelves to be children of the bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, for they look no further than their wages, or to eſcape the whip? We all know that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter confirmation an obedient child has of his father's love, and the ſecurity of his favour, the more chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, active and diligent he will be in doing his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's will, and careful not to do any thing to offend
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:011557_0040_0F872256A2F01780"/>him. And ſince it is ſo often aſſerted, that ſaints love and delight in God's law, how can any rational ſoul, (if they would let reaſon, inſtead of their own experience decide the caſe) imagine that clear diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of God's love and favour, would make men leſs careful to ſerve him?—Don't we all know that what men love and delight in, they will ſeek and purſue after, without being drove? as for inſtance, food that we love, we labour for earneſtly, and eat of it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, without being told that we ſhall die if we don't. And <hi>Job</hi> ſays, that he <hi>eſteemed the words of God's mouth more than his neceſſary food,</hi> chap. xxiii. 12. and <hi>David</hi> counted the divine law, to be <hi>ſweeter than the honey-comb.</hi> Pſal. xix. 10. Alſo, <hi>perſons</hi> that we love;—without driving, we ſeek all opportunities to enjoy their company. So will all thoſe that truly love God, and his ſaints,—yea ſuch as love the riches, honours, or pleaſures of this world, not only voluntarily run after them, but they alſo earneſtly crave a great deal of them: and ſo do thoſe who love Chriſt and holineſs; and they that are content with a little degree of grace, never knew the glory and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of divine things. <hi>David</hi> ſays, <hi>I ſhall be ſatisfied when I awake with thy likeneſs,</hi> Pſal. xvii. 15. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhort of this can fill the deſires of a gracious ſoul. The firſt epiſtle of <hi>John</hi> is peculiarly calculated to detect licentious hypocrites, and to preſs home a holy life upon all profeſſors of religion: and obſerve well the beloved diſciples method.—<hi>My little children, theſe things write I unto you, that ye ſin not.</hi>—But what if they ſhould happen to be enſnared in ſin? does he then ſet the terrors of hell before them? No, he preſents the grace and bleſſings of heaven;—<hi>If any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the father;</hi>—and <hi>if we confeſs our ſins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſs,</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:011557_0041_0F87225766D2CFF0"/>chap. i. 9. and ii. 1. And farther to attain this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous end, he ſets ſaints to admiring the wondrous love of God in taking them to be his children, and aſſerts that now they are the ſons of God, but what they ſhall be advanced to, does not yet appear; but ſays he, <hi>We</hi> KNOW <hi>that when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him; for we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> There is the ſtrongeſt aſſurance expreſt; but will that make them ſlack in their obedience? No, quite the contrary, for <hi>every man that hath this hope in him, purifieth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, even as be is pure;</hi>—and he declares, that he that can run on in ſin, <hi>Hath not ſeen</hi> Chriſt, <hi>neither known him,</hi> chap. iii. 1, 2, 3, 6. And now, are not hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites aſhamed of their notion that aſſurance is a licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious doctrine?—O my readers, I intreat and charge you before God, who ſhall judge us all, to ſearch cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically your own hearts, and ſee whether you are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by a ſpirit of bondage, and ſlaviſh fear, or by the ſpirit of adoption, whereby you can cry <hi>Abba Father,</hi> Rom. viii. 15.—</p>
            <p>I ſhall only anſwer a ſcruple that may ariſe here in ſome gracious ſouls, and then diſmiſs this head.—Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I hear ſome ſuch ſay, <q>Alas, I fear that I am a child of the bond-woman, for I often drag on heavity in duty, and I feel my heart ſo dull and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to ſpiritual exerciſes, that I can't think there is any grace in it.</q> But this ſhort queſtion may eaſily decide the caſe, viz. Is it the divine commands which are burdenſome to thee, or thy vile heart that often hinders thee from doing the things that thou wouldeſt?—God's ſervice is a <hi>wearineſs</hi> to hypocrites, <hi>Amos</hi> viii. 5. <hi>Mal.</hi> i. 13. But ſaints delight in his law after the inward man, though they find a law in their members warring againſt it, <hi>Rom.</hi> vii. 21, 22, 23.— Carefully obſerve this diſtinction, and you may come to know what your condition is.</p>

I ſhall cloſe with a ſhort addreſs to two or three ſorts of perſons. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> to thoſe that hold the contrary from me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſubjects of baptiſm, many of whom are very near to me. <hi>My dear friends,</hi> it may be ſome of you will be offended, and others grieved with me, when you ſee the foregoing lines. But I think I can truly ſay, that 'tis not out of bitterneſs, but rather out of love to you, that I have pen'd what you here ſee. Therefore I would only beg this one favour of you, namely, that you would candidly weigh what is here ſaid, in the balances of the ſanctuary, before you cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or caſt it by: and in order for this, let the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of all that have held the one ſide or the other of this principle be put intirely out of the queſtion, or you'll never come to the right of the caſe. That there have been good Men of both ſentiments is no ſcruple to me, and I believe not to you neither; and 'tis as evident that there have been bad men on both ſides: and ſhould you try to find out which had the greateſt number, it would be little to the purpoſe.— The miſchiefs that I have found by experience in theſe things make me caution you againſt them. <hi>David</hi> was a man of a much better character than <hi>Joab;</hi> yet <hi>Joab</hi> had the right of the caſe concerning numbering the people, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxi.—Therefore let us all obey the divine command to <hi>ceaſe from man,</hi> viewing that all fleſh is but fading graſs: and be willing that this matter ſhould be decided alone by <hi>the word of our God that ſhall ſtand for ever,</hi> (Iſa. ii. 22. and xl. 8.) And if after a diligent ſearching of the ſcriptures, you ſtill remain of a different mind from me; yet ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that to his own maſter each ſoul ſtands or falls, and ſo forbear all bitter cenſures. And O that each one would with greater earneſtneſs <hi>forget the things that are behind, and preſs towards the glorious
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:011557_0043_0F872258D3FD8DC0"/>mark;</hi> believing that wherein we are differently mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, God ſhall in his own time reveal the whole truth unto us, <hi>Phil.</hi> iii. 14, 15. Oh, when ſhall that bleſſed day come, when ſaints will have done with all miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings of each other; when they ſhall all join with one heart and ſoul to praiſe our glorious King for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall ſay a word to ſuch as are of my ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents concerning baptiſm.—Brethren, what I have to ſpeak to you is, <hi>Live up to your principles.</hi>—How in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable will thoſe appear, who inſiſt upon it that perſons muſt believe in order to be baptized; and yet admit ſuch to this ordinance who give no proper evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of any thing more than an hiſtorical or doctrinal faith? whereas a believing with <hi>all the heart</hi> is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to give a right thereto, <hi>Act.</hi> viii. 37. And though God alone can ſearch the heart; yet <hi>fruits</hi> of <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> ſhould be carefully looked after in this caſe.— And as little excuſe can be found for them, that while they plead that we muſt be <hi>buried with Chriſt in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> yet behave as though ſin lived and reigned in their hearts ſtill, inſtead of being <hi>dead indeed unto ſin but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live unto God thro' Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> Rom. vi. 4, 11. Therefore let none while they profeſs to know God, deny him in works: but be exhorted ſo to walk as to <hi>adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</hi>—This would have a much greater tendency to bring others to imbrace the truth in theſe things, than many warm diſputes without a good life. 'Tis not eaſy to imagine how much uſe is made of the corrupt lives of numbers of thoſe in the land who are called <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> to bar the minds of thouſands againſt <hi>receiving,</hi> or even candidly <hi>weighing</hi> and <hi>examining</hi> what I firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe are truths which they hold. And tho' I am not excuſing ſuch conduct; yet I would earneſtly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you all as much as may be to <hi>cut off occaſion
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:011557_0044_0F872259944A65A0"/>from thoſe that deſire occaſion</hi> thus to treat the truth and them that hold it. And if others ſay that we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard, and are cruel to our children, becauſe we don't baptize them before they are converted: let each head of a family, walk in his houſe with a perfect heart, and behave ſo towards the little ones that God has given him, as to evidence that he has a much greater regard for the ſpiritual, than the temporal welfare of his children.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I will cloſe with a word to all the children of the bond woman, <hi>My dear fellow Men,</hi> be intreated to conſider how ſad your caſe and condition is. If you flouriſh in the world more than the ſaints, and are let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone to live as you liſt: this is but a miſerable portion, which preſently will be all ſtript from you, and God will ſay, <hi>How much they have glorified themſelves, and lived deliciouſly, ſo much torment and ſorrow give them,</hi> Jam. 5.— Rev. 18.7.—Many of you are ready to think, that there is too much ado made about religion, and can laugh at the devotions of the godly. But Oh! remember and take warning by your old father <hi>Iſhmael:</hi> he made a <hi>mock</hi> of his fathers joy, in ſeeing the accompliſhment of God's promiſe; which is here (ver. 29.) call'd <hi>perſecution,</hi> for which he was <hi>caſt out</hi> from the bleſſings which he had deſpiſed. <hi>Now therefore be ye not mockers leſt your bands be made ſtrong,</hi> (Iſa. 28.22.) but fly to Chriſt, that your ſouls may live.— And are there any of you who are ſeeking help by the life of your own Hands; how does Chriſt expoſtulate with you (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.2, 3.) ſaving, <hi>Wherefore do ye ſpend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which ſatisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your Soul delight itſelf in fatneſs. Incline your ear, and come unto me; hear and your ſouls ſhall live, and I will make an everlaſting covenant with you, even the ſure mercies of</hi> David. AMEN.</p>

            <head>AN APPENDIX, Containing an Anſwer to a late Piece, intitled, "A Letterd treating upon the Subject and Mode of <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> wrote to a Friend:" By Mr <hi>Ebenezer Frothingham,</hi> Paſtor of a Church of Chriſt in <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town, Connecticut.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I Suppoſe all conſiderate perſons will allow, that in ſearching after truth, it is very neceſſary to avoid having our paſſions inflamed, or our minds biaſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the queſtion is truly ſtated, and the arguments on each ſide fairly examined; yet how commonly is the contrary method taken by the advocates for <hi>infant-baptiſm?</hi> Of which Mr. <hi>F</hi>—'s preface is a notable ſpecimen.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He tells the reader of, <q>Great diviſions that have roſe in this day of reformation about baptiſm, thro' which means the cauſe of Chriſt has been greatly wounded.</q>—P. 3. Now it is certain that Chriſt and his Truth have occaſioned diviſions in all ages, though all the blame belongs to thoſe who are oppoſite thereto; therefore our principles muſt firſt be proved not to be true, before they can juſtly be charged as the blamable cauſe of diviſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He begs the very point in debate, and then char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges us with the horrid crime of ſacrilege; for, refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:011557_0046_0F87225B13632668"/>to Prov. 20.25. he ſays, <q>Water ſeparated to a ſacred uſe, and uſed in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, in baptizing an infant or adult per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is God's ordinance and is holy—and thoſe that reject it <hi>devour that which is holy.</hi>
               </q>—P. 4, 5. Whereas the very queſtion between us is, Whether water applied to an infant in the ſacred name is GOD's ordinance or not? And for him to ſay it is, without proof, is a plain begging of the queſtion; and if we may take his word for it, is a ſhrewd token that he has fallen on the wrong ſide: For in another caſe he ſays, <q>Mr. <hi>Bartlet</hi> has made a ſad miſtake, which is common for all perſons to do, that are ſo unhappy as to fall on the wrong ſide of the queſtion. He has beg'd the whole matter in debate.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Frothingham</hi>'s late <hi>Key</hi> to the conſtitution in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut,</hi> Pag. 13.</note> Yet.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As if this was not enough to prejudice the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's mind, he ſays, <q>Search through the land, in this day of reformation, and you may find that all thoſe that have run into thoſe wild antinomian ſchemes, that put away their lawful wives and huſbands, and took others poſſeſſed with unclean ſpirits of devils, who were dreadful blaſphemers alſo: All theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected infant-baptiſm as a limb of antichriſt, and moſt of them have been rebaptized by dipping. Not a mortal who holds to infant-baptiſm, who ſeriouſly and ſolemnly practiſes therein, has been left of God to any of theſe awful deluſions that I have ever heard of.</q>—P. 5. Thus he would perſuade the reader that good is intailed, to infant-baptiſm, and evil to its opponants; but this is ſo far from truth, that the moſt awful deluſion of that nature that I have known in our day, was in a member of the church in <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury;</hi> who after he had declared a revelation for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother woman, for which the church juſtly excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:011557_0047_0F87225BD955E6A0"/>him, procured poiſon to diſpatch his wife out of the world, in order to accompliſh his horrid prediction: Yet I never heard him called a <hi>baptiſt</hi> in all my life. And though a letter from <hi>Middletown</hi> informs me, that Mr. <hi>F.</hi> has named <hi>Dowglas</hi> and <hi>Abbe,</hi> in his ſermons, as beginning their antinomianiſm with denying infant-baptiſm; yet I can truly declare, that I was called to preach to a ſociety in <hi>Windham,</hi> in <hi>April</hi> 1747, ſoon after they broached their deluſions there, and I preached there frequently till the next <hi>September,</hi> had converſe with theſe men, and was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times interrupted in my preaching by them; yet I can't recollect that I ever heard them ſay one word againſt infant-baptiſm; and I cannot learn by my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in the next town, that they have ever heard them called <hi>baptiſts</hi> to this day.</p>
            <p>I am not willing to charge him with known falſhood in this affair; and rather think that as there have been a number who were called baptiſts in our day, who have gone into the deluſions he ſpeaks of, therefore he has been carried away with the cuſtom which has been followed theſe two hundred years, to impute all that is evil to the baptiſts. But when will men have done with thinking it will do to <hi>talk wickedly for God!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Having repreſented our way in ſuch a horrid light, Mr. <hi>F.</hi> proceeds to tell the reader of a number, who have been convinced of its being an error, and have returned to the practice of infant-baptiſm, of which he was one; and ſays he went ſo far, that if he had met with a baptiſt elder, he ſhould have been re-baptized. And while he would repreſent that we act upon ſcruples and negatives, he ſays, <q>I was bro't to ſee, inaſmuch as I <hi>was</hi> baptized, it was neceſſary for me to ſee from the written word, that infants had <hi>not</hi> a right to baptiſm before I went forward to anſwer a good conſcience,</q> &amp;c. p. 6. Here again
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:011557_0048_0F87225D4AB64770"/>he begs the queſtion, which is, Whether he is truly baptized or not? And concludes that he <hi>was</hi> baptized, and then reſolves to hold the ſame till he can ſee from the <hi>written</hi> word that infants have <hi>not</hi> a right; that is, till he can ſee the <hi>letter</hi> of the word condemn infant-baptiſm, which is never named in any writings either divine or human, till two hundred years after Chriſt. This is one inſtance among many of our ſhort-ſighted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; for while others are charged with ſticking to the letter, and acting upon negatives, he determines to hold his practice till he can find in the letter a univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal negative againſt it: Yet in other caſes he would doubtleſs tell people, that in ordinances of worſhip it is not enough for us to ſay, It is not forbidden; for we muſt be able to anſwer that demand, Who hath <hi>required</hi> this at your hand? Iſa. 1.12. After this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of himſelf, he proceeds to tell us, that beſide private chriſtians he has known eight ordained elders that had been re-baptized, who have ſince retracted it. But if they did it upon the ſame principle that he did, ten thouſand times that number would not give us a warrant to follow them. The truth is, about 20 years ago in a ſeaſon of awakning and hopeful converſions in ſeveral places, the two denominations were brought to greater freedom toward each other, than in former times, which was a means of bringing many to a better underſtanding of the baptiſts principles, than they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had, and many embraced them; which cauſed others to riſe in great oppoſition thereto, and ſome leading men gave the alarm much as Mr. <hi>F.</hi> does in this preface. And a number were frightned and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back; though I ſhould think they have no great cauſe of glorying therein; for two of the eight mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters that he ſpeaks of, fell ſo much out of credit, as to drop preaching, and inliſted as ſoldiers into the army, and laid their bones in the wilderneſs. Two more of
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:011557_0049_0F8720D60059A920"/>them, parted from their flocks, and though they were ſettled over others, yet they did not continue there, but are now in an unſettled ſtate; and others can hardly treat their baptiſt brethren with a good temper. On the other hand, I have heard many confeſs that they have been afraid of the light in this matter, and after many years oppoſition, have given as rational and ſcriptural accounts of their being convinced that our principles were right, as I ever heard in any caſe whatever.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>F.</hi> ſays, <q>All the ſober ſolid baptiſts, would likely renounce their conduct in this caſe alſo, could they calmly, and with a ſingle eye, ſearch the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in this matter.</q>—P. 6. But whether he has taken a proper method to introduce ſuch a <hi>calm</hi> ſearch or not, is left to the reader's judgment; and whether he has or not, yet oh that ſuch a temper may be now granted to us!</p>
            <p>As to the rule itſelf, I agree with him, that ſatan lays two ſnares to hinder our taking of it right; one is to impoſe upon the judgment by an elevated imagination of ſomething new and wonderful in the ſcriptures, taking plain paſſages and turning them into an allegorical ſtrain or figurative ſenſe, ſo that the judgment miſſeth the duties taught or doctrines contained in the text: Or elſe, when it will ſuit his turn, he will try to keep us to the bare letter of the word, without regarding the true nature of God's will contained therein. And I fully concur, that when we take the ſcriptures right, they have <q>a natural tendency to lead the mind into a conformity to God's pure nature, which alſo tends to humble and purify the heart, and lead the mind into an underſtanding of the divine <hi>harmony</hi> of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which opens a path that leads home to glory.</q> P. 7, 8. In that path may we ever walk!
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:011557_0050_0F8720D7AA536360"/>I would here add, that our Lord's conſtant method of repelling the tempter, was by ſaying, <hi>It is written.</hi> And when the adverſary attempted to inſnare him in the ſame way, he would not depart from it to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical meaning, but brought another text which cut directly acroſs the partial ſenſe which the devil would put upon ſcripture. It is a known rule in divinity, not to depart from the literal ſenſe of a text, when it will clearly agree with the reſt of the bible; but if that ſenſe will not agree with other texts, then we may know it has a myſtical, and not a literal meaning. As for inſtance, <hi>David</hi> ſays, <hi>My fleſh ſhall reſt in hope, becauſe thou wilt not leave my ſoul in hell, neither wilt thou ſuffer thine holy One to ſee corruption.</hi> Now other ſcriptures evidence that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s fleſh ſaw corruption, from whence <hi>Peter</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates, that it is not literal but ſpiritual <hi>David</hi> who is there intended, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.25—31. Yet the reſt of the text ſtands good in its literal ſenſe, elſe the apoſtle could not have proved his point (Jeſus's reſurrection) from it; for only turn the words fleſh and corruption, to a myſtical ſenſe, and the reſurrection of the Meſſiah's body could never be proved from that text. Hence we may learn that the literal ſenſe of every text, and part of a text, is not to be departed from, when it clearly agrees with the analogy of faith. At the ſame time the plaineſt paſſages may admit of many myſtical or ſpiritual improvements, while the literal ſenſe ſtands good. It was never the leſs true in a literal ſenſe, that <hi>Abraham</hi> had two ſons, the one by a bond maid, the other by a free woman, becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> drew an allegory from thence concerning the two co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants: Yea, ſo far from it, that the literal facts are the foundation he goes upon in his allegory.</p>
            <p>Now let us come to apply theſe rules to the caſe before us. Mr. <hi>F.</hi> agrees with us, that, <q>Read where
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:011557_0051_0F8720D81D0A47C8"/>you will in the ſcriptures, faith is put before bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing, as to adult perſons, that never were baptized.</q> And he ſays, <q>The point in debate is, whether the infants of believers are ſubjects or not?</q>—P. 4. He holds that they are, and to prove it turns us to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s covenant; and attempts to prove,
<list>
                  <item>1. That it was the covenant of grace.</item>
                  <item>2. That <hi>Abraham</hi>'s chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were included therein.</item>
                  <item>3. That the Gentile church is graffed into the ſame covenant. And,</item>
                  <item>4. That their children are taken in with them.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>But in order to ſettle this matter, it is needful to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain what we mean by theſe terms. I fully concur with Mr. <hi>F.</hi> that, <q>Since <hi>Adam,</hi> our firſt natural head, fell from the covenant which he was placed in, the tenor of which was, <hi>do and live; tranſgreſs and die,</hi> the Moſt High has never come to commune with any of the race of <hi>Adam,</hi> nor to offer good to them, but only in the ſecond Head, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</q> P. 9, 10. And if by covenant of grace, we mean the glorious plan of ſalvation, which was laid in the divine mind from eternity, and was diſcovered at <hi>ſundry times and in divers manners</hi> to the <hi>fathers</hi> in the old teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and is brought into clear light in the new; and that one of thoſe <hi>divers manners,</hi> was by <hi>Abraham</hi>'s covenant: In this we have no difference. But if by the covenant of grace, he means the conſtitution, and limits of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> church, which deſcended in the line of natural generation, taking in with the parents all their natural offspring, which is evidently his meaning; in this I cannot concur with him, for theſe reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Becauſe this is an attempt to <hi>make man wiſer than God.</hi> For <hi>Paul</hi> in treating of the bleſſings which the goſpel reveals, ſays, <hi>Which things we ſpeak, not in the</hi> WORDS <hi>which man's wiſdom teacheth, but which the</hi> HOLY GHOST <hi>teacheth; comparing ſpiritual things with ſpiritual,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.13. And in explaining
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:011557_0052_0F8720D8E2E5F5C0"/>the deſign and end of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> covenant and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, he ſays, the <hi>new covenant</hi> is <hi>not according</hi> to that which was made with <hi>their fathers,</hi> Heb. 8. 9. Yet Mr. <hi>F.</hi> will dare to aſſert, that the apoſtle, <q>Is not in this text ſpeaking of two covenants, diſtinct in their nature and original; but of the ſame cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, under two different adminiſtrations?</q> P. 11. And he charges us with "ignorance," p. 13. becauſe we will not contradict the Holy Ghoſt as he does! He would have it that we bring thoſe words in a wrong ſenſe; but inſtead of following our Lord's example, and bringing another text which is <hi>written,</hi> contrary to our ſenſe of this, he brings the language of <hi>man's wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> to contradict the language of divine inſpiration; for he owns that, <q>we do not read the word, Chriſt, nor grace, nor faith, nor the new covenant in Gen. 17.</q> P. 9. And yet will venture to bring that chapter to contradict what is expreſt in Heb. 8. 9.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I cannot concur with his plan, becauſe it contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts the <hi>ſpirit as well as letter of the new covenant.</hi> And that,

               </list> Therefore the <hi>letter</hi> of it was, <hi>Do and live;</hi> and the reaſon here given for ſetting of it aſide is, <hi>becauſe they continued not in it, and I regarded them not, ſaith the Lord.</hi> But the
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:011557_0053_0F8720D9B489C888"/>tenor of the new covenant is, <hi>I will be to them a God, and they ſhall be to me a people,</hi> Heb. 8.9, 10.4. Theſe covenants differ greatly as to the ſtate of thoſe who are under them. The ſtate that <hi>Iſrael</hi> were in when they were called forth by <hi>Moſes</hi> to enter into covenant, <hi>As</hi> God had <hi>ſworn to their father</hi> Abraham, was ſuch that they had <hi>not an heart to perceive,—eyes to ſee, nor ears to hear,</hi> no not unto <hi>that day,</hi> Deut. 29.4,—13.<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Bellamy</hi> in his late dialogues againſt a half-way covenant; Mr. <hi>Green</hi> and others, have aſſerted that all the members of that church were received upon a ſuppoſition that they were true believers; whereas <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſo far from receiving them upon that ſuppoſition, that in this text he openly declared the contrary, as plainly as words can expreſs. And Mr. <hi>Beckwith,</hi> makes uſe of this text, againſt Mr. <hi>Green,</hi> to prove that a profeſſion of ſaving faith is not neceſſary in order to come into a goſpel church P. 71, 72. Such are the effects of confounding the two covenants together; for Mr. <hi>Beckwith</hi> declares that the grand point in this debate is, <q>Whether the Gentile church is not taken into the <hi>ſame</hi> covenant God eſtabliſhed with the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> church?</q> P 101. And he has confuſed and darkened things ſo much in this way, that he at laſt ventures to aſſert that we have no reaſon to think that "any thing more is intended," in the <hi>Eunuch's</hi> profeſſion, in Acts 8.37. but a belief, "up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on moral evidence," and therefore, that it did not imply a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of ſaving faith. P. 55. Which notion of his is as certainly falſe, as Rom. 10, 9, 10. is true.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But the ſtate of thoſe who are under the new cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is, they <hi>all know the Lord from the leaſt to the greateſt, and their ſins and iniquities he will remember no more,</hi> Heb. 8.11, 12. and 10.17.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>F.</hi> has two ways to evade the force of this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning: The firſt is to tell us we ſtick to the <hi>letter.</hi> If in this he has any reference to 2 Cor. 3.6. I deſire it may be noted that <hi>Paul</hi> is there opening the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and chriſtian miniſtry, and ſhews that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſtuck ſo cloſe to the letter, both of the moral and ceremonial law, that they could not
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:011557_0054_0F8720DA60A68D10"/>
               <hi>ſtedfaſtly look to the end of that which is aboliſhed;</hi> and this <hi>vail</hi> kept them from ſeeing the glorious fulfilment of the law in Jeſus Chriſt, who <hi>giveth life;</hi> but the <hi>letter killeth.</hi> In ſhort, with the <hi>letter</hi> of the old teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they would exclude the <hi>truth</hi> of the new; and the reader is left to judge who comes neareſt to ſuch conduct now.</p>
            <p>His other evaſion is by charging us with, <q>Not diſtinguiſhing between a ſoul's being internally united to Chriſt, and a perſon's being in viſible covenant relation.</q> P. 31. But this charge is very unjuſt, for we are well ſenſible of that diſtinction, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute is not whether ſome may not, through man's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, be admitted as true believers who are not ſo; but it is, whether the rule gives us warrant to baptize any without a perſonal profeſſion of their being ſuch or not? Thoſe who were baptized in the firſt chriſtian church, were they that <hi>gladly received the word;</hi> and thoſe which the Lord added to that church were <hi>ſuch as ſhould be ſaved,</hi> Acts 2.41, 47. And when two perſons had crept in, who were falſe heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they were awfully ſtruck dead, as a warning to others, and it had that effect; for we read that, <hi>of the reſt durſt no man join himſelf to them; but believers were the more added to the Lord,</hi> Act. 5.13, 14. And when the people of <hi>Samaria</hi> believed and were baptized, yet as ſoon as one of them diſcovered his unſoundneſs, <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid to him, <hi>Thou haſt neither part nor lot in this matter;</hi> and for this reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>thy heart is not right in the ſight of God,</hi> Acts 8.21. Here this diſtinction is plain; they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to baptiſm as true believers, and were rejected when they diſcovered that they were not ſuch. The ſame may be obſerved in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. compared with <hi>John</hi> 15. Chriſt is the <hi>Vine,</hi> his members are <hi>graffed</hi> in, and <hi>ſtand by faith</hi> in him; but if any are received
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:011557_0055_0F8720DB4AEF8B98"/>as branches of him who is the Head of his church, that prove fruitleſs, they will be <hi>broken off,</hi> and <hi>taken away,</hi> while living branches are <hi>purged</hi> that they may bring forth <hi>more fruit.</hi> Take the diſtinction thus, and the ſenſe is clear; but take it as Mr. <hi>F.</hi> does, that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are brought into the <hi>ſame</hi> covenant with the <hi>Jews,</hi> p. 18. and the natural conſequence is a national church; for all know the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> church was national. At the ſame time <hi>Arminians</hi> draw an argument from hence for their doctrine of falling from grace; and the ſenſe given above, is the beſt guard againſt both of theſe abuſes of the apoſtles diſcourſe.</p>
            <p n="3">III. I can't concur with Mr. <hi>F</hi>—'s ſcheme, becauſe it tends to deſtroy that <hi>diſtinction</hi> between the church and the world, which was deſigned by all thoſe covenants. In the firſt diſcovery of grace which God ever made to fallen man, he made a diſtinction and declared an irreconcilable enmity between the <hi>two ſeeds;</hi> which was verified in the two firſt children who were born: And after the wicked ſon had killed his brother, and <hi>Seth</hi> was born, he was ſaid to be <hi>another ſeed inſtead of</hi> Abel <hi>whom</hi> Cain <hi>ſlew.</hi> And for many generations the diſtinction was kept up between the <hi>ſons of God,</hi> and the <hi>children of men:</hi> And when they had <hi>corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their way,</hi> and loſt this diſtinction, God ſaid to <hi>Noah, The end of all fleſh is come before me;—I will deſtroy them with the earth; but with thee will I eſtabliſh my covenant,</hi> Gen. 6.13, 18. Accordingly he and his family were ſaved, while the world was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and religion was handed down among his poſterity for ſome ages; and when they had turned to idolatry, God called Abraham <hi>alone and bleſſed him,</hi> Iſa 51.2. And carried his ſeed through an <hi>iron furnace</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and wrought great wonders for them in the wilderneſs, and in the promiſed land, and gave them ſuch laws and ordinances as were ſufficient to
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:011557_0056_0F8720DBF2A32E38"/>keep them a religious people, in diſtinction from all others, if it was poſſible for outward means to do it. <hi>But the chief of the prieſts, and of the people, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed very much, after all the abominations of the Heathen;—therefore the Lord brought upon them the King of the</hi> Chaldees, 2 Chron. 36.14,—17.</p>
            <p>Hitherto covenants had included parents with their natural offspring; but at this time the Lord ſaid to the prophet, <hi>Behold the days come that I will make a new covenant with the houſe of</hi> Iſrael; NOT AC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CORDING <hi>to the covenant that I made with their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> Jer. 31.31, &amp;c. And the new teſtament ſhews abundantly that the difference lies in this, that the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant now runs in a ſpiritual and not in a natural line. The apoſtle in the ninth of the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhews, that the line runs, not in the <hi>children of the fleſh,</hi> but in the <hi>children of God,</hi> who are a <hi>remnant</hi> that <hi>ſhall be ſaved.</hi> And in the tenth chapter he opens the order of the goſpel;—<hi>that faith cometh by hearing the word of God,</hi> (not by natural deſcent) which word is <hi>believed with the heart,</hi> and then <hi>confeſſed with the mouth.</hi> And theſe only are God's people in a goſpel ſenſe. Upon this the eleventh chapter begins with this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, <hi>Hath God caſt away his people?</hi> In anſwer to which the apoſtle ſhews that he and a number more of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural ſeed, were not caſt away; even a <hi>remnant according to the election of grace; and if by grace, then</hi> it is <hi>no more of works: Otherwiſe grace is no more grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>F.</hi> will agree with me, that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Gentiles were graffed in among <hi>ſpiritual Iſrael,</hi> and yet he would bring his <hi>natural</hi> offspring in with him; but what the apoſtle here ſays of grace and works, is as true of fleſh and ſpirit; they are diſtinct, and ought never to be confounded together: Yet ſince they are in this caſe, I would obſerve that the prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:011557_0057_0F8720DC93F6C378"/>was as expreſly given to <hi>Aaron</hi>'s poſterity by an <hi>everlaſting covenant,</hi> Num. 25.13. as ever church-memberſhip was to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſeed; yea much more ſtrictly; for none but <hi>Aaron</hi>'s lawful ſeed might ever miniſter in the prieſts office in that church, and the ſtranger that came nigh was to be put to death, Num. 18.7. while ſtrangers were freely admitted into <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s covenant: And why is not <hi>Aaron</hi>'s everlaſting covenant regarded as much as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s? And thoſe miniſters who often tell us of <hi>David</hi>'s error in not having the ark carried upon the prieſts ſhoulders, which they deſign as a warning againſt any perſons preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they have not approbated, how dare they introduce any into the miniſtry who are not miniſters natural ſeed? If they ſay, <hi>Aaron</hi> was a type of Chriſt, and his children a type of the ſaints; we readily grant it: And miniſters, in diſtinction from other ſaints, are never called prieſts in the new teſtament; therefore how dare they attempt to take the ark from theſe prieſts ſhoulders, who are the <hi>pillar and ground of the truth,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.15. and aſſume it to themſelves?— This leads me to ſay,</p>
            <p n="4">IV. I cannot join with Mr. <hi>F.</hi> in his way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruing the new teſtament by the old, becauſe it opens a door for the greateſt part of the <hi>ſuperſtitions</hi> and abominations that have ever been impoſed upon the chriſtian church. When we interpret the old teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the new, then it appears plain that all thoſe covenants which included the children with their fathers, were figures of the great Head of the church and his members: And that ſince he is come, thoſe covenants as well as ordinances are done away. But when men turned to interpreting the new teſtament by the old, then they muſt have a <hi>Pope</hi> to anſwer to the high prieſt; and as goſpel privileges are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be greater than thoſe of the <hi>Jews,</hi> they
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:011557_0058_0F8720DD5AE095B0"/>muſt have more orders of office than the prieſts had, with <hi>ſurplices</hi> inſtead of their <hi>ephods;</hi> yea <hi>tythes,</hi> and what not? And as the prieſts ſentence decided abundance of caſes in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> church, what pleas have been made from thence for the pope's power, and for miniſterial authority, to the depriving of the ſaints of their precious right of judging for themſelves in religion, inſtead of allowing the government of the church now, to be in this <hi>holy prieſthood?</hi> 1 Pet. 2.5.</p>
            <p>He before whom all things are naked and opened, gave early warning againſt theſe ſnares, and not only told his people that the <hi>covenant</hi> which literal <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſtood in was <hi>old,</hi> and ready to <hi>vaniſh away;</hi> but alſo that Jeſus has <hi>blotted out</hi> that <hi>hand-writing of ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> and taken it out of the way, <hi>nailing it to his croſs:</hi> And this he gives as a caution not to let <hi>philoſophers judge them,</hi> nor with their <hi>vain deceit</hi> introduce <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi> among them after the <hi>commandments and doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines of men,</hi> Col. 2.8, 14, 16, 20.</p>
            <p>Another pernicious effect of this way of conſtruing ſcripture, is the breaking down the walls of Chriſt's vineyard, and laying it as an open field, ſo that all ſorts of perſons may come to the Lord's table, almoſt without diſtinction. This evil in the national church was a principal cauſe of our fathers leaving it, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this country. And they held ſtrictly that none ought to be received into the church, without a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a work of grace in their hearts; and that none but ſuch might bring their children to baptiſm, till thoſe children began to have families. Then came on a trial concerning what ſhould be done with their infants; and Mr. <hi>Henry Dunſtar,</hi> preſident of <hi>Harvard</hi> college, (ſoon after he had finiſhed that verſion of the Pſalms which has been uſed in <hi>New-England</hi> ever ſince) was convinced ſo that he <q>thought himſelf under ſome
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:011557_0059_0F8720DE15C35D88"/>obligation to bear his teſtimony in ſome ſermons, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the adminiſtration of baptiſm to any infant whatſoever. <note n="*" place="bottom">

               </q> And Mr. <hi>Mitchel,</hi> paſtor of the church in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> was by his means brought to great ſcruples of infant-baptiſm, yet he ſoon concluded they were from the <hi>evil one,</hi> and to guard againſt them ſays, <q>I reſolved on Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>'s principle, that I would have an argument able to remove a mountain before I would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </q> And having <hi>reſolved</hi> and prayed and ſtrove againſt them for nine years, he got furniſhed ſo, that the author of his life informs us, that the determination of the point, in the Synod of 1662, about perſons owning the covenant and bringing their children, <q>Was more owing to him than to any one man in the world.</q> And the ground he intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them upon was that, <q>If the parent be in the viſible church, his infant child is ſo alſo.</q> Yet whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe perſons ſhould be baptized as in a <hi>catholic,</hi> or in a <hi>particular</hi> church ſtate, this ſays he, <q>Is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther queſtion: And I confeſs myſelf not altogether ſo peremptory,—as in the thing itſelf, viz. <hi>That they ought to be baptized.</hi>

            <p>Preſident <hi>Edwards</hi> wrote 20 years ago, and Mr. <hi>Jacob Green</hi> of <hi>New-Jerſey,</hi> has done the like lately, to ſhew that perſons ought to profeſs ſanctifying grace, in order to be admitted into the church; but againſt the one and the other, Mr. <hi>Blake</hi>'s words have been quoted, who ſays, <q>I have often marvelled what men mean, when they ſpeak of admiſſion of members in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to churches, when the parties of whom they ſpeak have already equal right with themſelves, to mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip: If baptiſm is admiſſion, then their title is as good that were thus before admitted, as their's that give them admiſſion.<note n="†" place="bottom">

               </q> And how can Mr. <hi>F.</hi> ſtand before this reaſoning, while he holds as be does, that the children of believers, <q>are bleſſed of Chriſt, and belong to his <hi>viſible</hi> kingdom, which is the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial part; baptiſm is but a conſequence that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth?</q> P. 23.

<pb n="63" facs="unknown:011557_0062_0F8720E159FC34D8"/>follow alſo? For both equally belong to Chriſt's viſible kingdom? His conſequence therefore proves either too much, or too little for his purpoſe; for he has long been contending againſt an half-way covenant, ſo that if theſe children are "in covenant with God;" as he aſſerts in the ſame page, then they have a right to all the ordinances of Chriſt's viſible kingdom; but if he limits the matter to thoſe only who are truly "bleſſed of Chriſt;" or where <hi>Peter</hi> did, <q>Even to as many as the Lord ſhall call;</q> then he gives up the point, and comes into our ſentiments. And how is it poſſible to hold a right to baptiſm from circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and yet deny baptized perſons right to the ſupper; unleſs miniſters do by divine rules, as 'tis loudly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, that rulers at this day do by human laws, viz. aſſume a <hi>diſcretionary</hi> power to take what ſuits their turn, and neglect the reſt!</p>
            <p>Theſe things naturally tend as I ſaid, to lay Chriſt's vineyard as an open field, and a great part of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of our land now apply to the <hi>church</hi> what he ſaid of the <hi>world,</hi> in Matt. 13.30, 38.

                  <hi>Let both grow together until the harveſt,</hi> is Chriſt's direction to his churches.</q> P. 21. According to which, thoſe who <hi>appear</hi> by their <hi>fruits</hi> to be <hi>children of the wicked One,</hi> muſt be let alone in the church 'till the harveſt, and what a church is that! And this conſtruing of the new teſtament by the old, has greatly corrupted the doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines as well as the order of the church. Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> one of the greateſt champions that has appeared in our day againſt <hi>Calviniſm;</hi> in his diſcourſe which he calls, 'A key to the apoſtolic writings,' takes the conditional and figurative language of the old teſtament to explain the new with, by which key he would take <hi>Paul</hi>'s words, where he ſpeaks of <hi>Adam</hi>'s poſterity becoming
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:011557_0063_0F8720E2AAA121B8"/>ſinners in and by him, and of juſtification by Chriſt alone, &amp;c. and turn them from their plain meaning, to ſome figurative ſenſe, in order to evade the evidence which they give for the doctrines which he diſlikes; though herein he does nothing leſs than make the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired Apoſtle a liar, who ſays, <hi>We uſe great</hi> PLAINNESS <hi>of ſpeech, and</hi> NOT AS Moſes <hi>which put a veil over his face, that the children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>could not ſtedfaſtly look to the end of that which is aboliſhed,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.12, 13. I ſay, he does nothing leſs than make the apoſtle a liar, repreſenting that AS <hi>Moſes</hi> he uſes obſcure figures, and not <hi>great plainneſs!</hi> And oh! that my fathers and brethren ſaw how much they countenance ſuch horrid conduct, while they take the figurative co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants and ordinances in the old teſtament to conſtrue what the goſpel ſays concerning the new covenant by, and ſtigmatize thoſe who take the goſpel <hi>plainly</hi> to mean as it ſays, with the name of ſticking to the <hi>let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter only!</hi>

            <p>Mr. <hi>Beckwith</hi> pretends to hold to the <hi>Calvaniſtic</hi> doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines, yet he thinks Mr. <hi>Green</hi> is "much miſtaken," in ſuppoſing that a perſon's coming to goſpel ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>implies</hi> a declaration of repentance and ſaving faith. And (with Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> of <hi>Lebanon</hi>) comparing it to a marriage, ſays, the bride <q>does not profeſs that ſhe <hi>has</hi> performed the articles of the marriage cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; but that ſhe <hi>will</hi> perform them thenceforth, to the end of her life.</q> And calling the ordinances ſeals, he ſays, <q>God's giving or ſetting on his ſeal, by the hand of his embaſſador, implies his gracious and ſure engagement to fulfil and make good to that ſoul, all the bleſſings of grace and ſalvation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in the covenants; <hi>provided,</hi> or on <hi>condition</hi> that perſon keeps or fulfils the <hi>obedience</hi> and <hi>duty</hi> engaged for on his part; ſo that both ways, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances

                     <hi>Beckwith</hi> againſt <hi>Green,</hi> p. 27. In p. 22. he ſays, <q>Miniſters and churches have a right to enquire into, and judge of the viſible ſtanding of their members, but not the inviſible ſtate of their hearts: <hi>Who art thou that judgeſt another man's ſervant?</hi>
                     </q>—And he inſiſts much upon it, that if baptiſm belonged only to real ſaints, then <q>we could not with any ſafety or ſatisfaction, adminiſter it at all.</q> P. 43. Well what is this <hi>viſible ſtanding</hi> which we have a right to judge of? Why he ſays, <q>Then we have a <hi>ſure</hi> foundation to go upon, in determining who have a right to the ſeals and who not, viz. ſuch as are of <hi>ſound principles</hi> in the chriſtian faith, and <hi>morally ſincere</hi> in their covenanting; this gives a right to all the ſeals.</q> P. 44. I wonder what Mr. <hi>B.</hi> thinks <hi>ſound principles,</hi> or <hi>moral ſincerity</hi> is; whether ſomething in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or only an outward ſhew! It makes me think of an affair that happened ſome years ago, not far from him: A man of note declared that a perſon might externally keep all the precepts of the moral law, out of regard to <hi>Molock;</hi> and when ſeveral things were ſaid to expoſe the abſurdity of this notion, it was objected that they did not take notice that he ſaid, <hi>externally.</hi> Yes, ſays the other, I obſerve he means that a perſon may love God with <hi>all his heart, externally!</hi>
                     <p>In reality it is quite as difficult to know when a perſon has moral ſincerity, as ſaving faith; one lies in conviction and reſtraints upon the conſcience, the other is the love of the truth in the heart: And it often happens that when a perſon that has had ſome conviction, gets into the church, ſo as to <hi>eat and drink</hi> in the divine preſence, he ſhakes off his concern, and his <hi>laſt ſtate is worſe than the firſt.</hi>

            <p>This is the ſame ſcheme that was introduced among the churches of <hi>Galatia,</hi> the tenor of which was, <hi>The man that doth them ſhall live in them,</hi> ver. 12.

            <p>I am ſatisfied that Mr. <hi>F.</hi> does not commonly teach perſons in ſuch a way; yet I thought it might be of ſome benefit to him and others to expoſe theſe dangerous ſnares here; and if he ſhould think it an injury thus to be introduced into the company of miniſters who invite ſouls to ordinances to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, let him look into his 28th page, where he ſays, <q>The parent has an advantage to improve the child's early dedication in baptiſm (as the child grows up to years of underſtanding) in order for the child's conviction and converſion.</q> If baptiſm then is a converting ordinance, why not the ſupper alſo?

Thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conquered, the holy Ghoſt revealed Jeſus Chriſt to our ſouls, in his glory, power, love and all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency, —and our ſouls accepted him freely upon goſpel terms; and ſo the Lord wrought in our ſouls, faith and love, which was accompanied with a living union to Chriſt, and a new obedience, which flows from an immortal principle of like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to God. <note n="*" place="bottom">Diſcourſe on the churches privileges, pag. 6, 7.</note>

            <p>This looks like converſion, but the other is the ſame point that the <hi>Jews</hi> contended ſo much upon formerly, who, as Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> obſerves, looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves, <q>As by nature <hi>holy</hi> and favourites of God, becauſe they were the children of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>

And the way that 'tis often co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, even from themſelves as well as others, is by the ambiguity of words. It was a ſolemn demand which was made to <hi>Job,</hi> after his long diſpute with his friend, <q>Who is this that <hi>darkneth counſel</hi> with <hi>words</hi> without <hi>knowledge?</hi>
               </q> And it ſurely calls for our ſpecial notice in the preſent debate. To uſe <hi>words</hi> without diſtinct, or without a ſteady meaning, ever tends to <hi>darken counſel;</hi> yet, as Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> obſerves, we often ſee this to be the caſe in diſputes, and that with words on, which the argument chiefly turns. And I think his cenſure is juſt upon ſuch conduct. <q>One, ſays he, who ſhould ſpeak thus in the affairs and buſineſs of the world, and call eight ſometimes ſeven, ſometimes nine, as beſt ſerved his advantage, would preſently have clap'd upon him one of the two names men conſtantly are diſguſted with, (i. e. fool or knave); and yet in arguings and learned conteſts, the ſame ſort of proceeding paſſes commonly for wit and learning: But yet to me, it appears a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſhoneſty, than the miſplacing of counters, in the caſting up a debt, and the cheat the greater, by how much truth is of greater concernment and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue than money <note n="*" place="bottom">Eſſay on human underſtanding, B.

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now let us ſee if we have not ſomething of the ſame nature in the preſent controverſy. The words on which it chiefly turns, are, "The covenant of grace
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:011557_0068_0F8720ED16DE6E60"/>was made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and believers are now in the <hi>ſame</hi> covenant," We readily grant that the convenant of grace was made known to him, and that he was ſaved by faith, as ſaints are now; but the covenant of circumciſion, as it contained the conſtitution and limits of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> church, we cannot look upon to be the ſame that believers are in now. Well they allow ſome difference; for the <hi>Jews</hi> are broken off, and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles are graffed in, and have greater privileges. How? why tis ſaid, Then the church was limited to one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, now it is open for all believers to come in with their houſholds. Yet when the matter is examined, they don't mean to have all the <hi>men</hi> of their houſholds baptized as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s were circumciſed, but only their <hi>infants;</hi> neither do they mean that every one of them <hi>when</hi> they have baptized them, ſhall <hi>then</hi> eat the Lord's ſupper, as all <hi>Iſrael</hi> did the paſſover. So that they cannot hold the conſtitution of the church to be the ſame; but <hi>conſtitution</hi> is not a ſcriptural word, and they ſtill aſſert that the covenant is the ſame as it was with <hi>Abraham;</hi> and when we bring <hi>Paul</hi>'s words, which ſhew it is not the ſame, then we ſtick to the letter, and tis declared that he does not mean two diſtinct covenants, only the ſame under two admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations. Juſt now the word <hi>conſtitution</hi> was unſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, but now <hi>adminiſtration</hi> muſt come in to prove that <hi>Paul</hi> did not mean as he ſaid!</p>
            <p>Another turn for thoſe words in Heb. 8.9. is that the new covenant there means the internal efficacy of the covenant; as if it had no internal efficacy till that time: Whereas Rom. 4.11. ſpeaks plainly of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward efficacy to <hi>Abraham;</hi> but they often attempt from that text to prove that the external covenant now is the ſame with the covenant of circumciſion.</p>
            <p>Thus we have a covenant that is the ſame, and not the ſame; larger than the covenant of circumciſion,
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:011557_0069_0F8720EDD5D1FBB8"/>yet not ſo large; a different adminiſtration, yet they adminiſter ordinances to the ſame ſubjects,—believers and their houſholds; though ſtill it is only to part of them, to wit, the infants therein. Upon another turn there is a great difference, for the old covenant was external, the new one is internal;—yet after all it is as external as the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> covenant was, and only has different ordinances, but the ſame ſubjects! I muſt confeſs this makes me think of the beaſt which <hi>myſtery Babylon</hi> ſat upon, which <hi>was, and is not, and yet is,</hi> Rev. 17.8. I read alſo in an ancient record that, <hi>her ways are moveable, that thou canſt not know them,</hi> Prov. 5.6. And does it not give us reaſon to think, this practice was derived from her, ſince it requires ſuch <hi>movings</hi> and ſhifting to ſupport it?</p>
            <p>The divine command is, <hi>Make ſtrait paths for your feet.</hi> Which if we obey, and come <hi>ſtrait</hi> up to the point, we may find that as baptiſm is an external ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the goſpel church now, as circumciſion was of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> church formerly; and that neither of them were introduced by man's conjectures, but by expreſs command: So that the ſubjects of each are plainly expreſt in the command, and not left for men to find out by uncertain conſequences. The firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrator of baptiſm warned the <hi>Jews</hi> againſt think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to come to it with a plea that they had <hi>Abraham</hi> to their father; and when a complaint was made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Paul,</hi> that he taught the <hi>Jews</hi> which were among the Gentiles to forſake <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſaying, that they <hi>ought not to circumciſe their children, James</hi> ſays, <hi>As touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gentiles which believe, we have written and concluded, that they obſerve</hi> NO SUCH THINGS, Acts 21.25. Yet now a common pretence is, that we ought to <hi>obſerve ſuch things,</hi> as bringing children to the ordinance on their parents right; and they ſay, <q>The patent ſealed by baptiſm is (ſo to ſpeak) the very
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:011557_0070_0F8720EE9CD07AE8"/>ſame parchment that was given to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and therefore neceſſarily contains all the <hi>ſame</hi> privileges and benefits, and makes theſe over to the <hi>ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;</hi> there is nothing altered, but the ſeal <hi>only.</hi>

               </q> And this is given as a reaſon why we have no <hi>expreſs declaration</hi> for bringing infants to baptiſm.</p>
            <p>Is not this affair much like the <hi>Jews</hi> traditions, which the learned could not read in <hi>the book,</hi> becauſe it was ſealed; and the unlearned could not read it, becauſe he was <hi>not learned?</hi> Yet they propoſe a very good end in it, which is to keep their children in the <hi>fear of God.</hi> But we are aſſured that it is <hi>in vain,</hi>—while this fear is <hi>taught by the precept of men.</hi> And as vain are their <hi>turning things upſide down,</hi> and <hi>ſeeking deep to hide their counſel,</hi> Iſa. 29.11,—16. Matt. 15.7,—9.</p>
            <p>Here many will turn their addreſs to people's natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral paſſions, and a declaration that we condemn all our good fathers, and that we are cruel to our children, will often carry the point, even where ſcripture and reaſon both fail them. Yet if we could hear our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, one of the moſt eminent of them told his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple when they were coming to this country, that <q>It was not poſſible the chriſtian world ſhould come ſo lately out of ſuch antichriſtian darkneſs, and that full perfection of knowledge ſhould break forth at once.</q> Therefore he charged them before God and his bleſſed angels, to follow him, <q>No farther than he followed Chriſt;</q> but to act according to their covenant, wherein they, <q>engaged with God and one another, to receive whatever light or truth ſhould be made known to them from his written word. <note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Prince</hi>'s chronology, p. 89, 90.</note>
               </q> What an abuſe then is it of mankind, to bring the name of our good fathers to hinder our acting agreeable to their covenant with God, &amp; their ſolemn charge to us! They
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:011557_0071_0F8720EF57E80690"/>knew themſelves to be imperfect, and perhaps ſome of them gave as full evidence that they were ſo, by their conduct relating to this affair, as in any of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour. Governor <hi>Hutchinſon,</hi> in ſpeaking of the baptiſts, ſays, <q>In Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>'s time, ſoon after the year 1640, it appears by his letters that <hi>many</hi> were inclined that way, and he expreſſes his apprehenſion that the <hi>number would increaſe.</hi>

                  <hi>Reſolved</hi> he would have an argument able to remove a mountain before he would recede from it.</q> And Mr. <hi>Mitchel</hi> owns that he was "fearful" of going to Mr. <hi>Dunſtar,</hi> who had been an inſtrument of ſhaking his confidence about infant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſm, notwithſtanding he looked upon him to his dying day to be "a worthy and a godly man." Who yet was removed, <q>from the government of the <hi>col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,</hi> and from his dwelling-place in <hi>Cambridge,</hi>
               </q> for no other reaſon only, than becauſe he <q>thought himſelf under ſome obligation to bear his teſtimony,—againſt the adminiſtration of baptiſm to any infant what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. <note n="†" place="bottom">

            <p>We are often accuſed of <hi>wilfulneſs</hi> in our way, but has any thing ever appeared to ſupport the charge, comparable to what is here proved on the other ſide? And I have before ſhewn ſomething of the pernicious effects which theſe things have had in our land. And as, to <hi>remove a mountain,</hi> is to work a miracle, muſt we now have a miracle wrought to convince us that we ought not to follow our fathers in that which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſupported by the bible! The day is haſtning when all things will be laid open in their true nature; then will be made manifeſt, who have been cruel to their
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:011557_0072_0F8720F015BEE118"/>children, either thoſe who have laboured to convince them that they are ſinners by nature and practice, and have uſed goſpel methods to bring them to Chriſt, and then to his ſpecial ordinances; or thoſe who have cried <hi>peace, peace, when there was no peace.</hi> Yea, I think the charge of cruelty may be juſtly turned back upon them, even as to ſuch of their children as afterwards prove to be godly perſons; for there are great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of them at this day in <hi>New-England,</hi> who will readily own, that if there had been nothing done, they ſhould be at no loſs how to act now; and I have heard ſome of them ſay plainly that, <q>It appeared to them a great privilege if they might follow their Lord <hi>into the water,</hi>
               </q> but their parents had laid a block in their way by telling them that they are already baptized, and that to be rebaptized is a dreadful thing. Thus they, and not we, cut children off from the precious privilege of <hi>anſwering a good conſcience</hi> in baptiſm: For Mr. <hi>F.</hi> owns, that <q>In order to the conſcience being good, it muſt be informed from the word of God, and act in the knowledge of the truth.</q> P. 5. I ſay amen thereto; and ſince what the apoſtle ſays concerning <hi>invented objects</hi> of worſhip, is as true of <hi>invented forms,</hi> viz. <hi>We know that they are nothing in the world,</hi> 1 Cor. 8.4. therefore it is no crime to leave what miſtaken mortals have invented, to practice what God calls baptiſm in his word.</p>
            <p>Before I cloſe I muſt anſwer ſome charges of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency which are laid againſt our principles.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Mr. <hi>F.</hi> ſays, <q>I think it is beyond them to make their practice conſiſtent, in denying infants right to baptiſm, becauſe the letter does not ſhew where an infant was baptized; and yet at the ſame time keep the firſt day as a ſabbath, when the latter duty is far leſs plain than the former.</q> P. 4.</p>

               <pb n="74" facs="unknown:011557_0073_0F8720F23AF9CB28"/>
Let us try the point. If it is aſked why we keep the firſt day? We can ſhew that Jeſus aroſe on that day, and as the Fathers reſting from the works of creation, is given as a reaſon why the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould keep the ſeventh day; ſo the SON's reſting from the works of redemption appears a reaſon why we ſhould keep the firſt day. Hence when the Apoſtle is open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the difference between the <hi>jewiſh</hi> and chriſtian diſpenſations, he ſays, <hi>There remaineth therefore a reſt</hi> (or keeping of a <hi>ſabbath,</hi> as the margin reads it) <hi>to the people of God: For</hi> HE <hi>that is entered into his reſt, hath ceaſed from his own works,</hi> AS GOD <hi>did from his,</hi> Heb. 4.9, 10.<note n="*" place="bottom">Should any ſay that this text has no reference to any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular day, but only to ſpiritual reſt. I anſwer, that baptiſm and the ſupper have reference to ſpiritual bleſſings, yet that is far from rendering the literal obſervation of them uſeleſs: So I look upon the caſe here. God ſaid of <hi>Iſrael. I gave them my Sabbaths, to be a ſign between me and them,</hi> Ezek. 20.12. And a change from the ſeventh to the firſt day, ſeems to be a ſign of the difference between the two covenants, for as one required our work before the reward; ſo the other gives the ſoul <hi>reſt</hi> in Chriſt, in order to work for his glory.</note> And we have expreſs examples of the Apoſtles and others meeting on that day for worſhip, to break bread, and to offer their liberality, John 20.19, 26. Acts 20.7.1 Cor. 16.2. And when the apoſtle <hi>John</hi> would let the churches know when he had his firſt viſion in <hi>Patmos,</hi> he tells them it was on the <hi>Lord's day,</hi> Rev. 1.10. As to the ſtupid cant of ſome, that, Every day is the Lord's:— It is as true that every table, and every ſupper is alſo his; but what mockery would it make of the bible, to ſay when it ſpeaks of the <hi>Lord's-table,</hi> and the <hi>Lord's-ſupper,</hi> that it means no more than every table, and every ſupper! 1 Cor. 10.21. and 11.20. No, ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous minds give in that it means a table and ſupper, which is ſet apart from a common to a ſacred uſe,
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:011557_0074_0F8720F30ED6DBD0"/>as an ordinance of divine worſhip. So we take the <hi>Lord's-day</hi> to mean this day as ſet apart from other days for his worſhip, and known by that name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the churches to which <hi>John</hi> wrote.</p>
            <p>What a bias of mind then is diſcovered, in ſaying that this duty is, "Far leſs plain," than infant-baptiſm, of which we have neither precept nor example in all the bible! Nay, I muſt turn the argument, and obſerve, that the apoſtle names the <hi>jewiſh ſabbath-days,</hi> as well as <hi>circumciſion,</hi> among the <hi>hand writing of ordinances,</hi> which Chriſt has <hi>blotted out,</hi> Col. 2.11, 13, 10. And if infant-bapuſm is held from thence, why not the ſeventh day alſo?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Mr <hi>F.</hi> ſays, <q>I look upon the baptiſt brethren inconſiſtent with themſelves, for rejecting infants from being ſubjects of baptiſm, becauſe the letter does not ſhew where an infant was baptized; and at the ſame time will not allow any perſon to be baptized, unleſs put all under water, when the letter no where ſhews that a perſon was put under water in all the bible.</q> P. 34. Here let the reader re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how far I have concur'd with him in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning about the letter: This being obſerved, I ſhall at preſent only fix upon one point, which is, that <hi>Paul</hi> ſays in one place, we are <hi>buried by baptiſm,</hi> and in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother that we are <hi>buried in baptiſm,</hi> Rom. 6.4. Col. 2.12. And among all the critics upon our tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I never knew any object againſt the tranſlation of theſe words, neither do we differ about the meaning of the word <hi>buried:</hi> All the diſpute is concerning what is here intended by baptiſm. The word is uſed in the ſcripture, for an ordinance in the church, for a work of the ſpirit, and for ſufferings. Well let wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſpirit, or troubles be intended here, yet ſtill the word is expreſs, we are <hi>buried by it,—buried in it.</hi> So that let men go to which they will to find out the
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:011557_0075_0F8720F4E5BB0AD8"/>meaning of the word, ſtill it is <hi>burying;</hi> and unleſs they can make out that to be <hi>buried</hi> is not to be <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,</hi> they muſt know, that to be baptized with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is to be covered with water.</p>
            <p>Our author inclines to the old abſurdity, of running to places where the word baptiſm is uſed in a <hi>figurative</hi> way, to find out its <hi>literal</hi> meaning: But what work ſhould we make if we ſhould determine the full mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word <hi>thief,</hi> by Rev. 16.15! He tells us of God's <q>pouring out his ſpirit, and of raining down righteouſneſs.</q> P. 34. So he does, and who does not know that waters which compoſe <hi>rivers</hi> were firſt rained down from above? And the bleſſings which flow from Chriſt are called, <hi>Rivers of water in a dry place.</hi> Iſa. 32.2. And the account which divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration gives of the diſciples being baptized with the Holy Ghoſt, ſays, <hi>It filled all the houſe</hi> where they were ſitting:—And they were <hi>all filled</hi> with the Holy Ghoſt, Acts 2.2, 4. So as to Chriſt's ſufferings which are called a baptiſm, we have ſcarce a clearer prophecy of them any where than in the 69th Pſalm; and in that Pſalm, the ſame perſon who ſays, <q>They gave me gall for my meat, and in my thirſt they gave me vinegar to drink;</q> alſo ſays, <q>I am come into <hi>deep waters,</hi> where the <hi>floods overflow me,</hi>
               </q> ver. 2, 21. How plainly do all theſe carry the idea of immerſion in the meaning of the word? Mr. <hi>F.</hi> cites a great number of texts, in order to prove that ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and waſhing or bathing, mean the ſame thing; but they are far from anſwering his deſign. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, in Num. 19, 18. to <hi>dip</hi> and to <hi>ſprinkle,</hi> plainly convey two ideas, as diſtinct from each other as the words are; and ſo does <hi>ſprinkling</hi> and <hi>bathing</hi> in the next verſe. And in the epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> where the deſign of theſe ceremonies is explained, it appears that <hi>ſprinkling</hi> referred to the removal of guilt, and
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:011557_0076_0F8720F557B51F50"/>
               <hi>waſhing</hi> or <hi>bathing,</hi> to the taking away the filth of ſin; or in other words, the firſt referred to juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the other to ſanctification. The <hi>ſprinkling of blood</hi> protected from the ſtroke of vengeance, and <hi>ſprinkling</hi> the <hi>conſcience</hi> removes its guilt; but having our <hi>bodies</hi> (or whole man) <hi>waſhed with pure water,</hi> is alſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in order to <hi>draw near to God</hi> in <hi>his houſe.</hi> Heb. 10.21, 22. and 11.28. Now ſince all allow that Rom. 6.4. ſignifies our obligation to die to ſin, and to walk in newneſs of life; which is as much as to own that it ſignifies our ſanctification, why are they ſo fond of a mode which typified juſtification, unleſs they mean to confound them together, as too many do? It was not <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s holineſs or good works that ſecured them from the deſtroying angels ſtroke, but it was the <hi>ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of blood,</hi> which pointed directly to <hi>Chriſt our paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over</hi> who is <hi>ſacrificed for us,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.7.</p>
            <p>And ſince we are ſo often refer'd to the baptiſm of the ſpirit, let it be noted that it is only an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary degree of it which is called a baptiſm. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples ſurely had a meaſure of it when they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and when Jeſus appeared to them after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, he breathed on them and ſaid, <hi>Receive ye the holy Ghoſt,</hi> John 20.22. Yet all this is not called a baptiſm; but on the day of his aſcention he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to wait at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for that promiſed bleſſing, <hi>For,</hi> ſaid he, John <hi>truly baptiſed with water; but ye ſhall be baptized with the holy Ghoſt, not many days hence,</hi> Acts 1.5. Alſo let it be obſerved that we are often referred to the baptiſm of the Spirit, in order to find the meaning of the word, which they ſay is by ſprinkling or pouring; yet when we come to Rom. 6.4. they would have it, that <hi>burying</hi> there has no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to literal, but to ſpiritual baptiſm. Thus again their ways are <hi>moveable,</hi> and not <hi>ſtrait paths.</hi> I leave it therefore to the readers judgment, who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:011557_0077_0F8720FCAFA50198"/>and ſuperſtitious about the mode, p. 31. either thoſe who hold that we are <hi>buried</hi> in baptiſm, or thoſe who ſay tis as well to be <hi>ſprinkled,</hi> without being able to produce one text in the bible where that word is applied to baptiſm.</p>
            <p>To ſum up all, I think I have made it appear that Mr. <hi>F.</hi> is not juſt in charging us with ſticking to the letter, ſo as not to regard the nature of God's will contained therein, and have ſhewn that we regard the "divine <hi>harmony</hi> of the ſcriptures," which he holds to be a ſure token that we underſtand them right. And I leave it to be conſidered, whether he has not been taken in both of the ſnares which he cautioned o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers againſt: That is, whether his imagination has not been ſo elevated with <hi>houſholds</hi> being in covenant, while at the ſame time he ſticks ſo cloſe to the letter of the words, <hi>To thee and to thy ſeed,</hi>—as to miſtake what the divine will is therein. The main body of his diſcourſe is taken up in proving that the bleſſings of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>: were diſcovered to <hi>Abraham,</hi> which no body will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; but what is that to his purpoſe, ſo long as it appears that all thoſe covenants that included parents was their children, were in that reſpect figurative of Chriſt and his ſaints? Yea <hi>Adam,</hi> as he ſtood the covenant nead of his poſterity, was a <hi>figure of Him that was to come,</hi> Rom. 5.14. Therefore if the ſubſtance of thoſe ſhadows is come, how can the external covenant be the ſame? And if he ſtill thinks it is, then I deſire he would ſhew why <hi>Aaron</hi>'s covenant does not entail the miniſtry to a natural line, as much as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s can church-memberſhip, or a right to ordinances.</p>
            <p>He frequently charges us with antinominiſm, yet all the colour of proof that our principles have any tendency that way, that I can find from him, lies in three things. 1. He ſays, if the holineſs in Cor. 7. 14. <q>Reſpects not ſomething of a religious right, or
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:011557_0078_0F8720FE8F249640"/>what is ſacred, then I grant, it means as the baptiſts ſay; and the conſequence I think cannot be avoided, that all children that are not begotten ſo faith, or in the new covenant, muſt be baſtards: A rank anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomian principle, againſt the light of nature!</q> P. 24. This is notable reaſoning! It is as much as to ſay, <q>becauſe we hold, that a man's being brought into the faith no ways diſſolves his former marriage, that therefore the unavoidable conſequence is, that his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren which he had then are illegitimate!</q> Rather is nor the concluſion plain in the text, that if the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting as man and wife were not warranted by the law of Chriſt, then their children muſt be unclean in our ſenſe of the word? Here alſo we have another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the <hi>moveable ways</hi> of our opponents; for they all own that this text ſhews that the ceremonial law (by which the <hi>Jews wives and ſuch as were born of them,</hi> were <hi>put away, Ezra.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>0.3.) is not now in force; and they take the ſenſe of the word <hi>ſanctified,</hi> as we do, from the goſpel, 1 Tim. 4 3—5. Yet they turn directly back, and take their ſenſe of the word <hi>holy</hi> from the ceremonial law, which is out of date: And call us antinomians, becauſe we will not go in theſe <hi>crooked ways</hi> with them!</p>
            <p n="2">2. Mr. <hi>F.</hi> inſinuates that our doing what he calls re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptizing, leads to antinomianiſm, p. 4, 5. He calls it a devouring that which is holy: But if a ſoul is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that infant-ſprinkling has no warrant from the bible, what crime can it be to leave it, and practice what is plainly commanded therein? Yea, he allows ſuch acting to be right; but preſumes to aſſert that we do not act ſo. P. 30. However, as long as we know that we do, his cenſure will not move us; unleſs it be with pity for his raſhneſs. A third thing that he repeatedly brings, is, that ſome perſons of our denomination have run into antinomian errors; which, unleſs he had prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:011557_0079_0F8721005DF1E8A8"/>that our principles had a tendency that way, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout as good reaſoning, as it is for an infidel to bring <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus</hi> to prove chriſtianity to be a deluſion. And ſince Mr. <hi>F.</hi> has declared his intention of enlarging upon that ſubject, if I publiſh my anſwer to him; I ſhall only deſire him to take his late book, and turn to what he has wrote concerning the like treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which he and his brethren have received from thoſe called ſtanding miniſters; where he juſtly obſerves that he and his brethren, <q>are no more to account for thoſe out of covenant, than the ſtanding miniſters are for every corrupt, profane, immoral perſon, that waits upon their miniſtry.<note n="*" place="bottom">His Key, p. 29. 35.</note>
               </q> And if he acts accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own rule, I am not afraid of his hurting us; and if he acts contrary thereto, he will only expoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in trying to expoſe others.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe what I have now wrote, together with the foregoing ſermon, may ſerve as a ſufficient anſwer to what Mr. <hi>Frothingham</hi> has printed on the ſubject; and ſhall only add, that in a letter to me, he ſays, <q>You may remember, brother, that ſome years back we ſtood in union together in the ſpirit and practice of the goſpel, and now it is broke, thro' your practice.</q> On which I would obſerve, that he knows our covenant (like that of our fathers) was, <q>Still to be looking for more light from God, which is contained in the ſacred ſcriptures.<note n="†" place="bottom">His diſcourſe on the churches privileges, 1750. p. 19.</note>
               </q> Which covenant I conſcientiouſly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to unto this day, though I have been harſhly treated by many therefor.</p>
            <p>This brings to mind what I met with in a late jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into the northern part of our country. A learned miniſter of the common denomination, had challenged a public diſpute about baptiſm, which, as the caſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, I could not fairly avoid accepting. It was
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:011557_0080_0F8721009CFD3420"/>held in his own pulpit on <hi>October</hi> 30. 1769, before a conſiderable congregation. We were favoured ſo as not to have an angry word, that I know of, on either ſide; yet near the cloſe of above five hours diſpute, he charged us with want of <hi>charity;</hi> and ſaid they could have charity for us, if we would for them. I told him, charity was love, and we deſired to exerciſe love towards all, according to their different circumſtances; but as to the extending of chriſtian fellowſhip, the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſays, <hi>Charity rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth:</hi> And juſt ſo far as we can unite in any ſpiritual exerciſe in the truth, with any perſons we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to do it, and no farther. And as all who hold to the external uſe of the ordinances, agree that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ought to be baptized before they come to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of the ſupper; therefore we are no more rigid than they, in refuſing to partake of that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance with unbaptized perſons.</p>
            <p>Soon after this he ſhut up his books, and gave a ſpecimen of his <hi>charity</hi> before all the people; for many of them expected, as he had prayed at the beginning, that he would give me the ſame liberty in the concluſion; but inſtead of that, after a little pauſe, he made a motion for me to go out, and the aſſembly diſperſed without any ſocial worſhip at all. This looks ſomething like what I heard an aged fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſay ſome years ago, to wit, That many when they preach up charity and a catholic ſpirit, only mean to have others drop their different ſentiments and come in and join with them; but where is the man upon earth, who will not allow as much liberty as that?</p>
            <p>I have elſewhere ſhewn that our fathers and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren on Mr. <hi>Frothingham</hi>'s ſide, firſt broke the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between us;<note n="*" place="bottom">Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Fiſh,</hi> p. 118, 119.</note> and I could eaſily ſhew how it
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:011557_0081_0F872101599D28D0"/>appears that many of them are the moſt rigid unto this day, but as it is an unpleaſant taſk, I chuſe to omit it. We are all in danger of a party ſpirit, which we ought to be on a ſtrict watch againſt, on all hands. Some accuſe us with not allowing them to be viſible chriſtians, becauſe we do not hold them to be truly baptized; but what a ſtrange miſtake is that? When the point we contend for is, that bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm ſhould be adminiſtred to none but viſible chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, ſo that if they are not ſuch before baptiſm, they cannot be baptized at all.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude with the words of a late worthy author, who ſays, <q>Why do I trouble the reader about the communion of ſaints, in this or the other particular form? We are fallen in a day when many devoutly diſclaim it. It is now very common to make light of ordinances, and even for ſerious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to talk as if they valued themſelves on being of no denomination of chriſtians; if a man, ſay they, loves Jeſus Chriſt, or a preacher ſets forth the mercy of the Father in him, we have no concern about his form of religion; yet they cry up the martyrs, many of whom might have ſaved their treaſure and blood, had they made no conſcience of the authority of Chriſt in his houſe. The upright will deprecate a meer name, under any form, however agreable to the dictates of ſcripture, but if a man intends by his being of no denomination, that he regards not the <hi>manner of ſervice</hi> appointed by the Lord; where is his religion?—If Chriſt is preached, and the power of godlineſs prevails, by whomſoever, or whatever particular form of profeſſion, his miniſters and people rejoice; yet, if judicious; not ſo but that wherein a man appears defective, in any doctrine of the goſpel, or article of inſtituted worſhip, they muſt wiſh him to know the way of the Lord more
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:011557_0082_0F8721021772F1E8"/>perfectly, and conſequently, rather in meekneſs point out his miſtake than join him in his error.—In a word, that notion of charity, that renders the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject indifferent about any thing which he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to be the will of Chriſt, is falſe and pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; it tends to captivate the minds of men from the authority of God, and ſap the foundation of all true religion; it is therefore dangerous, when under any pretence, perſons are taught to be unconcerned about the appointed form of worſhip; it ſhould rather be commended to every one to ſearch the ſcripture, and keep to that which his conſcience directs, and regard not the cenſures of men. <note n="*" place="bottom">Lectures on primitive Chriſtianity, by Mr. <hi>Benjamin Wallin,</hi> preface, pag. 7—11.
