            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to the Word, but do not live according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; they liſten to Temptation, and do not what they are Commanded; they forbear not what they are forbidden: They pleaſe their Curioſity by hearing; they give themſelves a diverſion from their Labours, they fill their Heads with Knowledge, they get Eſtimation, but they do not put what they hear in practiſe; there be few but do ſome things, but theſe don't yield Univerſal Obedience to Chriſt. (2.) The cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that he paſſes upon them, he reſembles them to <hi>a Fooliſh man that builds his houſe upon the Sand.</hi> They act imprudently for themſelves, they are like a man that builds his houſe upon a movea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble foundation, which will not ſtand when the Torrent comes, and the Winds blow: So theſe men build their hopes for Heaven, upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

are built upon grounds that will utterly fail them. Hopes of Salvation are no evidence that men are in a good condition; men had need examine the foundation of their Hope. It would be well for ſome Profeſſors, if their hopes were converted into fears: They meerly cheat themſelves by nouriſhing ſuch hopes. Some Profeſſors are much put to it to get and keep an Hope for Salvation, and when they have got it, it is good for nothing: Many Profeſſors are careleſs and preſumptuous, and take up with ſuch hopes as will utterly deceive them: <hi>Job</hi> 8.13, 14. <hi>The Hypocrites hope ſhall periſh, whoſe hope ſhall be cut off, and whoſe truſt ſhall be a Spiders web.</hi> Job. 27.8. <hi>What is the hope of the Hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God ſhall take away his Soul?</hi> Rev. 3.17. <hi>Thou ſayeſt thou art rich and increaſed in goods and haſt need of nothing, and knoweſt not that thou art wretched and miſerable, and poor &amp; blind and naked.</hi>

            <p>Here I ſhall anſwer two Enquiries.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>When do men build there hopes upon a good foundation: upon a foundation that will not fail in a time of tryal?</hi>

ſeveral miſtakes about mens believing in Chriſt: ſome men take that for believing, which is not believing. Some men take encouragement from their own Righteouſneſs to truſt in Chriſt, and they call that Faith: but men may know that they do believe. Faith in Chriſt is a thing that may clearly be diſcerned and underſtood; faith is ſometimes very viſible: and when it is ſeen, men may aſſuredly gather, that God will beſtow eternal Life upon them: they have no reaſon to be afraid though they have a great many Infirmities: but they may conclude upon the Pardon of their Sins, &amp; everlaſting Life. Faith is like the Sword of <hi>Saul,</hi> &amp; Bow of <hi>Jonathan,</hi> it never fails of bringing men to Salvation: 1 Pet. 1.9. <hi>Receiving the end of your Faith even the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of your Souls:</hi> Rom. 15.13. <hi>The God of hope fill you with all joy &amp; peace in believing.</hi>

There be ſeveral Qualifications, which though they be not properly the conditions of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, yet they are things that do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company Salvation.

to all Gods Commandments: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.6. Being righteous: Mat. 13.43. <hi>Then ſhall the righteous ſhine like the Sun in the Kingdom of their Father.</hi> The knowledge of God: Joh. 17.3. <hi>This is eternal life to know thee, the only true God.</hi> There may be difficulty in making application of theſe ſigns; there be images and falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances of all Grace: and this makes ſome men miſtake, and think they have Grace when they have none: but when they do diſcover any of theſe ſigns in themſelves, they may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly conclude that they ſhall be Saved. If men ſee any Grace in themſelves, they may certainly lot upon Salvation; they ſhall not need to be at a loſs about their condition: this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides the controverſy about their Eternal Eſtate: 1 Joh. 3.14. <hi>We know that we are paſſed from death to life, becauſe we love the Brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>When do men build their hopes upon a falſe foundation, and flatter themſelves with vain hopes, when their Eſtate is nought?</hi>

            <p n="1">(1.) When they think that they accept of the offers of the Goſpel, but do not. Many men are pretenders to faith, that have none: Jam. 2.14. <hi>What doth it profit my Brethren, if a man ſay, he hath faith?</hi> Iſai. 48.2. <hi>They make mention of the holy City, and ſtay themſelves on the Lord God

of Iſrael.</hi> The miſtake ariſeth two ways, one is they don't underſtand the Nature of Faith; ſome have a perſwaſion, that the Goſpel is true, and they call that faith: ſome are convinced that Juſtification is not by Works, but by Faith, and they call that faith: ſome men hope that Chriſt will have pity upon them &amp; ſave them, and they call that faith: ſome men deſire to be found in the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and they call that faith: ſome men have a confidence that God will Save them, and they call that faith. The miſtake of ſome others does ariſe from Ignorance of the Working of their own hearts. They have a right notion of the nature of faith, but they do not diſcern their own hearts: they think, they come to Chriſt upon the meer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of his Righteouſneſs; but indeed they take only part of their encouragement from thence; the firſt ground of their encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is their own Sorrow, their deſires, their love to the People of God: yet they take in the Plea of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt. This makes the Apoſtle ſpeak as he doth: Rom. 11.6. <hi>If it be of Grace, it is no more of works, otherwiſe Grace is no more Grace; but if it be of works, it is no more Grace, otherwiſe work is no more work.</hi>

to attend it, if they know any thing to be a Sin, they are careful to avoid it; and ſo they think, they are obedient and walk in the law of the Lord: they don't walk after the fleſh, but have a reſpect to all Gods Commandments; but theſe men put a cheat upon themſelves, and lay a ſnare for their own Souls. <hi>Paul</hi> was Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious when he was a Phariſee: Phil. 3.6. <hi>Touching the righteouſneſs which is in the Law, was blameleſs.</hi> The common work of the Spirit of God will make men Conſcientious: Fears of Hell, and hopes of Heaven, will make men ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to avoid Sin, and to attend Duty. Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally mens Conſciences are very tender a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time before they come to Chriſt; ſuch as are Godly may remember, that they were Conſcientious before they were Godly, or had any Spiritual acquaintance with Chriſt.

<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001371_0012_0FB293943784BCF0"/>
this is a very poor argument: for the judgment of men about other mens Piety, is but a Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition: 1 Pet. 5.11. <hi>By Silvanus a faithful brother, as I ſuppoſe.</hi> No man can look into the heart of another, and ſee the workings of a gracious Spirit. Men can't ſee the Principles of Grace in themſelves, and they can neither ſee the Principles nor the actings of Grace in others. Godly men are often miſtaken in others; the Diſciples did not diſcern <hi>Judas</hi>: and tho' <hi>David</hi> did diſcern <hi>Doeg,</hi> yet for a great while he did not diſcern <hi>Ahitophel.</hi> In corrupt times, men are wont to be under great miſtakes; one Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite commends another: the <hi>Jews</hi> had a mighty Opinion of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees.</hi>

They do not know certainly what their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is, but they muſt run the venture of it they have looked upon their hopes to be pretty good theſe many years, and they cannot tell how to be brought to it now, to call all in queſtion again; they are for running the venture of it, right or wrong; there is more hopes of ſome vicious men than of theſe: Mat. 21.31. <hi>Publicans and Harlots ſhall enter into the Kingdom of God before you.</hi>
