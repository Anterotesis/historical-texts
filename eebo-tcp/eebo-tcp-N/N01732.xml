            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface.</head>
            <p>THE SERMONS emitted herewith, were not written with my own Hand, but taken from me when Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, by One that has a rare dexterity in Writing Characters, the same Person, who at first in Short hand, and after that in a very Ligible hand transcribed the <hi>Sermons on the Beatitudes,</hi> lately Printed. Upon the Perusal of <hi>these</hi> as well as <hi>those,</hi> I find them to agree with what I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered: but therefore plainess of style, and inculcations must be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>

               <pb n="ii" facs="unknown:002053_0003_0FBA8BAC685D1588"/>I have endeavoured to declare the great Truths of the Gospel with all possible plainess, and perspicuity, that the most ordinary Capacities might understand and be edified.</p>
            <p>The Occasion of the <hi>Discourse</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Sovereign Grace of God in the Salvation of the Elect,</hi> was, a Letter which a Worthy Minister, who lives in a Town remote from <hi>Boston</hi> sent to me, proposing that I would Preach and Publish some Meditations, on <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 8. I was the more willing to comply with his desire, that so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

in opposition, not only to the Errors of <hi>Pelagius, Papists,</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi> but of <hi>Arminians,</hi> &amp; <hi>Semi-Arminians;</hi> such as <hi>Amyrald, Testardus, Camero, Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenus,</hi> (not to mention any <hi>New Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodists</hi> of our own Nation) whose Writings are known to Learned Men, and well refuted by the very Learned <hi>Peter Du Moulin.</hi> These <hi>Discourses</hi> are not Published for the Instruction of great Scholars, but for the Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and Establishment of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary sort of Readers. And therefore they are not handled in a Polemick or Scholastick way, but in a Plain, Practical, and Scriptural Method.</p>
            <p>The Reverend and Learned Mr. <hi>Clarkson</hi> (who when belonging to the University, was Tutor to that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Man Dr. <hi>Tillotson</hi> late <hi>A. B.</hi> of <hi>Canturbury</hi>) has Written a Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Discourse of Free Grace,</hi> with whose Sentiments I fully<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> concur.

As also with Dr. <hi>Grew</hi> in his Excellent <hi>Sermons of Justification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is with the Lord to make my Endeavours on a profitable Subject to become profitable. I often think of (and I wish Young Preachers would think of it) the Advice of the famous Dr. <hi>Sibs</hi> to Young <hi>Thomas Goodwin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </gap> famous <hi>Doctor</hi> than the other) <hi>Young Man</hi> (said he) <hi>if ever you would do good, you must Preach Christ and Free Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No Man can expect any thing great from me, as on other accounts, so in respect of my great Age. It is true, that there is sometimes an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of an Old Man of whom it may be said as it was of <hi>Moses,</hi> and o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Caleb,</hi> That Age has not debilitated him.</p>

               <hi>Nec tarda senectus Debilitat vires animi, mutatque vigorem</hi>

               <pb n="v" facs="unknown:002053_0006_0FBA8BB186CD0EF0"/>It cannot be said so of me. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless it is some Encouragement to me, that there have been aged Men, (and aged Ministers too) who have brought forth fruit in Old Age, by Writing as well as other ways. Dr. <hi>Sheaf</hi> wrote a profitable Book when he was, (as now I am) arrived to the Eightieth Year of his Age. There is a blessed Promise, Psal. 92. 14. <hi>They shall still bring forth fruit in old age.</hi> Death (if the Lord shall so please) is far more Eligible than a useless Life, supposing it to be a death in the Lord. <hi>Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord, that they may rest from their labours, and their works do fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Holy Scriptures declares it.</hi> Gen. 8.21. <hi>The imagination of mans heart is evil from his youth.</hi> The Heart is put for the Soul, and all the powers and faculties of it; the Imagination of the heart, is the Mould in which thoughts are formed. The heart is like a Mint in which evil thoughts are Coyned continually. Thus it is with <hi>Man,</hi> not with this or that Man, but with every Man, and this from their <hi>Youth.</hi> The Hebrew word, <hi>Nagnar,</hi> is sometimes translated, a <hi>Babe,</hi> even Babes have this evil in them.

of Men can no sooner think, no sooner set their imaginations on work but they are thinking and imagining that which is evil; and they can no sooner Speak, but they Speak that which they ought not. Psal. 58.3. <hi>They go astray as soon as they are born speaking lies.</hi> Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred are apt to do so as soon as they can Speak; and they no sooner do any thing but they do that which is Evil.

True it is, That as Man did at his first Creation come out of Gods hands, there was no Sin in him. Eccl. 7.29. <hi>God made man upright, but they have sought out ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inventions.</hi> They, our first Parents, <hi>Adam</hi> &amp; <hi>Eve,</hi> sought out many sinful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions; and all their Children after them are doing as they did. When God Created Man, he was made in the Image of God.

<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002053_0011_0FBA8BB9616FE408"/>
in opposition to the likeness of God. Another Scripture speaks to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: Job 11. 12. <hi>Man is born like the wild asses colt</hi> It is not only true that he is foolish and unteachable, but that <hi>he is born so:</hi> As it is said, <hi>Folly is bound in the heart of a Child.</hi> There is a bundle of folly in his Heart.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This is evident, In that <hi>Infant Children are obnoxious to the wrath of God.</hi> Eph. 2. 3. <hi>Children of wrath by nature.</hi> Sometimes they bring into the World with them sad tokens of the displeasure of God.

Apostle was much set upon that Subject of <hi>Grace,</hi> therefore he mentions it no less than three times in four Verses. In the 5th verse rather than not mention it he brings it in by way of Parenthesis: He no sooner speaks of <hi>Salvation</hi> but he thinks of <hi>Grace,</hi> as we see in verse 5,7,8. By Grace here, is not meant that Grace which is wrought in Believers, or Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; altho' it is true there is no Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation without that; without holiness no man shall see the Lord: but hereby is meant <hi>Grace without us,</hi> or the Grace of God. So then the Doctrine before us is,</p>
               <p>DOCT. <hi>That the Salvation of Believers on Jesus Christ, is to be ascribed wholly to the Soveraign Grace of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are three particulars that may be inquired into. (1) What is imply'd in this Salvation the Text speaks of? (2) What is meant by the Grace of God? (3) How it does appear that the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Believers must be ascribed wholly and only to the Soveraign Grace of God.</p>
               <p>Quest. 1. <hi>What is imply'd in this Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> the Text speaks of?</p>

Another consideration that eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the truth we assert, is, The <hi>Stabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity &amp; Immutability</hi> of the decree of God; that which God has decreed it shall stand for ever. Psal.33.11. <hi>The counsel of the Lord standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all Generations.</hi> Therefore the Apostle speaks concerning the <hi>Immutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of the Counsel of God. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17. Men indeed they change their Minds, they decree a thing and don't perform it, they don't see all things at once, their <hi>second Thoughts are wisest.</hi> It is not so with the blessed GOD, whose Wisdom is Infinite, His counsel <hi>shall stand,</hi> particularly that of Election is said <hi>to stand.</hi> Rom. 9. 11. <hi>That the purpose of God according to Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might stand.</hi> It shall stand and no al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration shall be made in it. Therefore, it is said, as was but now mentioned. <hi>The Lord knows who are his, having this seal.</hi> A thing that is <hi>sealed</hi> is <hi>unal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

rejoycing to them. We see then the Salvation of Believers is built on the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting love of God as on a sure founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now Election proceeds from Grace, Rom. 11. 5. it is called, <hi>The Election of Grace.</hi> It is not from any works in Men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No. Deut.7.7. <hi>The Lord loved you, because he loved you.</hi> Nothing out of God Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self can be given as the reason of it: It is then from Grace; it is not from any holiness, from any worth in Men, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever they had a Being God had a purpose of Mercy to them. It is sai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of <hi>Jacob,</hi> before ever he either did good or evil, God had loved him and chosen him; therefore it cannot be from any works of holiness in Men. Eph.1.4. <hi>God hath chosen us before the foundation of the World, that we should be holy.</hi> Not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we are holy, but that we might be holy: we cannot suppose any cause of it, but the free Grace, and Favour of the most High. We cannot say the Merits of Christ has obtained Election, tho' all the saving benefits flowing from Election ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> been Merited by Christs Obedience, yet we cannot say that Election was Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Him; for Christ considered as
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:002053_0063_0FBA8C19099F6CB8"/>
Man, and as Mediator, is an object of Election. Isai.42.1. <hi>Behold my servant, mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth.</hi> Therefore it is said of Christ, 1 Pet. 1. 20. <hi>That he was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ore-ordained before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World,</hi> but was manifest in these last days. We see then Election proceeds from the free love of God. Joh.3.16. <hi>God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in him should not perish, but have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting life.</hi> God did not first send His Son into the World, and then love the World; but He loved the World of His Elect, therefore He sent His Son in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World to be their Saviour; then it must be resolv'd into the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of God that He chooses these and those, to eternal Salvation. It may be said indeed God did appoint some to Salvation that His Mercy might be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified for ever. God did Reprobate o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that so His Justice might be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for ever: True, but why did God choose <hi>Jacob</hi> rather than <hi>Esau?</hi> Why did He choose <hi>Peter</hi> rather than <hi>Judas?

Notice taken how Christ would take care of the safety of His People in those times of trouble, that were at hand. In this Verse there is another Angel spoken of, <hi>I saw another Angel,</hi> (says the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle) an Angel that did differ from those Seven that had the Trumpets given to them; this Angel heard the Prayers of all the Saints of God in the World, and He did offer <hi>Incense;</hi> which shows, that thereby Christ and He only is intended. The Angel here mentioned did offer In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense upon the <hi>Golden Altar,</hi> which was before the Throne. This has respect to what was customary among the Children of Israel, there was an Altar of Incense, a Golden Altar which the Priest did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Incense upon; and that Altar is said to be <hi>before the Throne,</hi> because it was before the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> which was said to be the Throne of God.

            <p>This is a Scripture Truth, a Mystery that is not known but only by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and by revelation from the Spirit of God.

Jesus Christ. Again, The <hi>High Priest</hi> was a singular Type of our Lord <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> The Priest was to offer Sacrifice; then to enter into the Sanctuary, there to offer <hi>Incense.</hi> Thus Christ has offered Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a Sacrifice, has not done that only, but has entered into the Sanctuary, into the holy place, and there He offers In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense. It is said, Heb. 8. 4. <hi>Is he to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Thus Christ is an <hi>Intercessor</hi> for His People, and He ever will be so, even to the end of the World.

manner as in His Estate of Humiliation He did; but He intercedes as becomes His state in Glory: We see the pattern of it, Joh. 17. 24. <hi>Father I will,</hi> that those whom thou hast given me, be with me, to behold my Glory. <hi>I will,</hi> Christ Intercedes as one that makes a Legal demand, that what He has bought and paid for, should be granted unto Him.</p>

give to them the things they humbly Pray and seek unto Him for. We find when the People were Praying <hi>without</hi> the Sanctuary, then the Priest was Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Incense within. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 10. We Read of <hi>Zacharias</hi> the Priest, that he did offer Incense on the Altar; and that then the People were Praying without. And doubtless there is an Allusion to that in the first Verse of this Eighth Chapter of the Revelations, where it is said, <hi>There was silence in Heaven for the space of half an hour.</hi> Thus it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews, when they were offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sacrifices, there was not silence; but the Temple rang with Musick while the Sacrifices were offering; but after they offered Sacrifice, Incense was offered, <hi>then all was silent.</hi> So then, Christ in Heaven is Interceding for His People, that their Prayers may be heard. When they are Praying on Earth out of the Holy Place, then He is Interceding with God before the Throne in Heaven; and the very things they Pray for, Christ does desire on their behalf, that those things may be granted to them. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires they may have those things which
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:002053_0115_0FBA8B58D2CB0518"/>
are the main Petitions that they present to God. As now, Believers Pray to God that they may be kept from Sinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Him, that of all evils they may be preserved from Sin, that is the request of all true Believers: Christ has made that Prayer on their behalf, Joh. 17. 15. <hi>I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the World:</hi> that is, before they have done all the work thou hast appointed for them; but <hi>I pray that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.</hi> What is <hi>the evil?</hi> Sin is the evil of evils, the greatest of evils; now Christ Prays for Believers, that they may be kept from that, that no Sin may ever prove a ruining iniquity to them, and it will be granted. Believers Pray that they may have Grace to perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, that they may hold on in the way God has commanded them to walk in; that is a special request which all true Believers earnestly present to God, that they may hold on to the end, may never turn aside from God: and Christ has made the same request to God, that they may <hi>Persevere</hi> in the way of holy Obedience to Him. He said to <hi>Peter,</hi> Luk. 22. 31. Satan has desired to sift you, but <hi>I have
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:002053_0116_0FBA8B5A1EF0C2D8"/>
prayed for thee that thy faith fail not.</hi> The faith of the true Believer shall never fail, tho' as to the actings, and the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of it, there may be a failing, yet as to the habit of faith, that shall never fail; when the Grace of Faith is really wrought in a Soul it shall never fail. The Believers is like a Tree that may be shaken by the wind, but is never pluck'd up by the roots: So the wind of temptation may shake the Believer grievously sometimes, but his root of Faith shall abide fast and firm. Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Pray that they may be brought safe to Heaven at the last; and Christ has interceded with God that it may be so. Christ has said, <hi>I will that they be with me where I am that they may behold my glory.</hi> They Pray that their Salvation may be carried on to a glorious perfection; and Christ in Heaven does intercede for them that it may be so. Rom. 5. 10. <hi>We were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled we shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by his life.</hi> Saved, that is, our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation perfected, by His Life, by His li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to be an Intercessor, So Christ in Heaven intercedes for Believers that
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:002053_0117_0FBA8B5D1E54EC50"/>
they may be brought safe thither, that their Salvation may be carried on to the highest degree and perfection, which is intimated, Heb. 7. 25. <hi>He is able to save to the uttermost them that come to God by him, since he ever liveth to make intercession for them.</hi> Save to the uttermost, that is to say, the Salvation of Believers is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on to a most glorious perfection, there shall be nothing wanting. And why? Christ ever lives to make Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession. Thus we see what Believers Pray for themselves, Christ Prays with them, presents the same desire before God that they present to him.</p>
            <p>PROP. IV. <hi>As Christ does intercede for Believers, so it is on the account of His Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and Mediation, that their Prayers are accepted with God.</hi> The Prayers of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are very acceptable to God, He takes delight in hearing them. <hi>David</hi> therefore said, <hi>Let my prayer be as incense.</hi> Incense was a sweet perfume, very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful to the senses; let my Prayer be so, sayes David. The reason why the Prayers of Believers are so, is because of <hi>the much incense that cometh out of the
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:002053_0118_0FBA8B5EAD6A7700"/>
Angels hand.</hi> Hence the Prayers of the Saints are so grateful to God: alas! there is many times that in their Prayers which is unsavory, that He might say to them, Your incense is an abomination to me; and threaten them as He did the Jews, <hi>I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours.</hi> God might say so of our Prayers that have so much sinful Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities in them, and in the best of them too: How come they then to be so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God? It is because of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> He by His Incense does take away the ill savour of our Prayers, and does present to God, that, that is highly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to Him. It is therefore said, Rev. 5. 8. <hi>There were golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of Saints.</hi> Golden vials; there were Censers made of Gold that the <hi>Incense</hi> was put into: the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Saints are very <hi>Odoriferous,</hi> very pleasing to God. How comes that to pass? It is because Christ Intercedes <hi>with them and for them.</hi> Christs Intercession will always prevail. Whatever Christ does ask for, it will certainly be granted. Suppose the thing to be never so Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous. Did He not say to <hi>Peter, If I
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:002053_0119_0FBA8B6023A248B0"/>
would pray to my Father for it, He would presently send an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> my of Angels to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>send</hi> my twelve Disciples: Yea, twelve Ligions of them, as many as made a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Army, and more if I would but pray for it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>3. And did He not say to God? Joh. 11. 42. <hi>I know that thou bearest me always.</hi> What Christ does Intercede for it is always accepted with God. That His Intercession is prevalent, and shall be regarded, and answered, is evident from several things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Intercession</hi> of a special favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite is regarded. When <hi>Esther</hi> was high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in favour with the King of Persia, he said to her, F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th. 5. 3. <hi>Queen Esther, what is thy petition, and it shall be granted.</hi> Our Lord <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is highly in favour with the King of Heaven, the King of all the World, and what He does Intercede for will surely be granted. God never did deny Him any thing, never will deny Him any thing: He is infinitely dear to God, therefore shall not go with a denial. Isai. 42. 1. <hi>Behold mine Elect in whom my soul delighteth.</hi> The very Soul of God does delight in the Lord <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> therefore He will grant what He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="114" facs="unknown:002053_0120_0FBA8B62E56BE138"/>2. It is evidently so, If we consider the Relation Christ does stand in towards God. Sometimes a faithful Servant has a great interest in his lord, and will be heard in what he requests. We read concerning the Centurion, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 2. That he had a <hi>Servant sick who was dear to him.</hi> Never was any Servant so dear to his Master, as Christ is to God: Christ as Mediator is Gods Servant, and the best and dearest Servant that ever the God of Heaven had; the most Wise, the most Prudent Servant, that ever God had, Isai. 52. 13. <hi>Behold my Servant shall deal pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently.</hi> And He is a most Faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. It is said of <hi>Moses,</hi> he was faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him that appointed him: but <hi>Christ is more worthy than Moses.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God did commit to Christ all His Elect. He trusted Him with all His Elect, and Christ did faithfully take care of them all. Joh. 17. 12. <hi>Of those thou hast given to me, I have lost none,</hi> saith Christ. The Elect of God that are given to Him, He will not lose any One of them. God has trusted Him with them, and He will be faithful. Christ is dear to God, not only as a Servant, but as a Son. <hi>We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:002053_0121_0FBA8B6500742278"/>
his glory as the glory of the only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the father,</hi> Joh. 1. 14. God has ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny adopted Sons, but One <hi>Own Son,</hi> Christ is His <hi>only begotten Son.</hi> There came a voice from Heaven and that more than once, when our Saviour submitted to Baptism, and when with His Disciples on the holy Mount, He was transfigured, that voice came from Heaven, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</hi> God delights in Him more than in any One else, more than in all the Creatures in the World; all the Angels in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven are not so dear to God as <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is.</p>
            <p n="3">3. CHRIST has purchased what He Intercedes for. Purchas'd it with the Price of His own Blood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 12. He is gone <hi>not without blood</hi> into the holy Place, He is gone to Heaven with the Merit of His blood, and pleads that before God continually: He has deserved what He asks for. The Altar of Incense had blood Sprinkled upon it, this signifying that <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ</hi> Intercedes by vertue of His blood. The high Priest after He offered Sacrifice once in a Year, did enter into the holiest of all, and there <hi>Sprinkled blood
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:002053_0122_0FBA8B6625F675C8"/>
on the mercy seat,</hi> teaching us that God is become Merciful to us through <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and that Christ Intercedes on the account of what His blood has Merited; that He desires nothing at the hand of Mercy but what He has Purchased at the hand of Justice. We may then be sure what Christ Intercedes for in behalf of His Elect, shall be graciously answered. For the blood of Christ is Infinitely Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious, because it is <hi>the blood of God:</hi> Not the blood of a meer Man, but of One who is God as well as Man. So the Scripture expressly declares to us, Acts 20. 28. <hi>The Church of God which he has pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased with his own blood.</hi> God with His own blood, that is Christ who is God. He is also Man, so was capable of shedding blood, as <hi>God Man</hi> He has Merited what He has shed His blood for: the blood of Christ has a powerful Voice. <hi>We are come to the blood of sprinkling, which speaks better things than the blood of Abel.</hi> Abel, his blood cryed for Vengeance, but the blood of Christ cries for Mercy on the behalf of Believers, of those, which this blood by the hand of faith is sprinkled on, it crys and sayes, Let this Sinner be
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:002053_0123_0FBA8B67CF6F56F8"/>
forgiven, notwithstanding all his Sins he has been guilty of, let him be saved E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally; then it must needs be so. We <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> then what Christ Intercedes for shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> opened in the particulars mentioned.</p>
            <p>USE, I. <hi>We should make sure that we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of those for whom Christ does Intercede.</hi> Then happy are we, considering Christs Intercession always prevails: and what does He Intercede for? Joh. 17. 17. <hi>Sanctifie them through thy truth.</hi> That Grace may be given to His Elect. Christ Prays that Sanctifying Grace may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to His Elect: And as for Believers who are Sanctified, it is His Prayer that they may be more Sanctified, that more Grace may be given to them. Are not those happy Men, happy Women, concerning whom this is true? Surely they are. Christ Prays that they <hi>may be where he is,</hi> and He is ascended into Heaven: He is gone to the Father, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gone that He may prepare a Place for them. Christ by His Intercession does prepare a Place in Heaven for all true Believers on His Name. It is true,
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:002053_0124_0FBA8B6CD9F99CC8"/>
there are some subjects of Christs Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession that cannot know they are so, Namely, the Elect of God while Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; but there are others may know Christ is Interceding for them, Namely, true Believers may know that Christ In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercedes for them, by their having <hi>the Spirit of Prayer;</hi> if they have the Spirit of Prayer it is certain Christ does Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede for them. Joh. 14. 16. <hi>I will pray the Father and he will send you another comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, even the spirit of truth.</hi> If God has sent his Spirit into our hearts, making Intercession, <hi>in us,</hi> we may know Christ is Interceding <hi>for us</hi> before the Throne of God in Heaven. The Apostle says, We know not what to Pray for as we ought, but the Spirit of God maketh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession <hi>in us</hi> with groans that cannot be uttered, If we have the Spirit of God making Intercession <hi>in us,</hi> we may believe, we should believe, Christ is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceding <hi>for us.</hi> Indeed Men may practice the duty of Prayer, yet not have the Spirit of Prayer; yea, a Man may have the gift of Prayer, able to Pray an hour or two, yet not have the Spirit of Prayer. Zech. 12. 10. <hi>I will pour the spirit of grace and supplication,</hi> upon the
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:002053_0125_0FBA8B6DA1770440"/>
house of David. If there is a Spirit of supplication, there is Grace wrought in the Soul. The Spirit of Prayer, What is it? It implies a continual Inclination <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Prayer; a Man that has the Spirit of Prayer, cannot for his Life live without Prayer; if he has been from God a while he cannot be at rest till he go to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. The Spirit of Prayer makes a Man desire chiefly Spiritual blessings; Nay, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> God should put him to his choice, Tell Me what thou wouldst have, Earthly or Heavenly good things, He says, Let me have Spiritual blessings; he Prays that God would give His Spirit to him; and will not God give His Spirit to them that ask it? We are sure He will. When a Man does desire that Christs Interest may prevail in the World, rather than any thing else; a Man that seeks in the first place the Kingdom of God, that is the Man that has the Spirit of Prayer, and may know Christ Intercedes for him.</p>
            <p>USE, II. The other <hi>Use</hi> is <hi>a word of Encouragement to practise this Duty of Prayer.</hi> Seeing we have an <hi>Intercessor in Heaven</hi> that presents our requests to
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:002053_0126_0FBA8B6F1E62DAB8"/>
God, that is encouragement enough to this duty. And <hi>what should we pray for</hi> We should Pray that the Interest of Christ may prevail in the World. In the Printed <hi>Proclamation</hi> for this day, We are directed to Pray, <hi>That the Interest <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Christ Intercedes for us, it is most rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable that we should Intercede for His Interest. <hi>Psal.</hi> 72. 15. It is said concerning Solomon, <hi>Prayer shall be made for him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually.</hi> Christ is the <hi>Solomon</hi> there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. Why, are we to Pray for Christ? Certainly He needs none of our Prayers who is blessed for ever; we are not to Pray for His Person, but for His Kingdom, that His Interest may prevail every where; that we are the rather to Pray for, because there are Prophesies i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

We should be the more fervent in Prayer for this, because the Time draws on a pace. I don't doubt, but there are some here

               </gap>ing the Church of God. We read of <hi>Daniel,</hi> that when he knew by Books the time for the deliverance from Captivity was at hand, he set himself to Pray with fasting. When we know the Time for the enlargement of Christs Kingdom is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> hand, wè should set our selves more fervently to Pray that it may be so. And truely if there be a Spirit of Prayer on that account, That will be a blessed sign that the time is near. And it must needs the near, for it is said, When <hi>the Seventh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> shall begin to sound, the mystery of God shall be finished.</hi> The Mystery of God, is the glorious Kingdom Christ shall pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in this lower World; and it is past doubt, we are come to the close of <hi>the Sixth Trumpet.</hi> Well then, <hi>the Seventh Trumpet</hi> will sound in a little time, then behold what is said; it is said, Rev. 11. 15. <hi>The Kingdoms of this World are become the Kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ, and he shall reign for ever &amp; ever.</hi> Therefore let us Pray, that it may be so; we don't know what God may bring out of the present Commotions &amp; Shakings of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:002053_0128_0FBA8B73B6DCFF88"/>
This we know, before those glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Times come there will be dark and dismal times, terrible shakings of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons &amp; Kingdoms. The Lord has said, <hi>I will shake all Nations, and the desire of all Nations shall come into his Temple.</hi> What God will bring out of the present sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, is known to Himself; if there be a Spirit of Prayer, that will cause shakings to be among the Nations. It is said in the Context before us, after the Prayers of the Saints with the much Incense gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, There were <hi>Thundrings and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, &amp; an Earthquake.</hi> Some have sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed that there was a Notable fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Scripture, by what was done in the days of the Emperor <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi> He with his Army was surrounded with Heathen Enemies, before he would give them Battel, He fell down on his Knees at the head of his Army, Prayed earnestly to God to be with him: God sent Thunder &amp; Lightning, and an horrible Tempest, which beat back the Weapons of the Enemies upon themselves, &amp; gave him a glorious Victory: that Victory made a Mighty <hi>Revolution</hi> in the World.

We likewise hear that in <hi>Hungary,</hi> Protestants

Also that those Places which in the late War were taken from the <hi>Turks,</hi> are put into the hands of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,</hi> who are worse &amp; more bloody than the <hi>Turks.

It is said of One of the Kings of <hi>Persia,</hi> when he gave en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to build the Temple, they were to Pray for the Life of the King, and of his Sons, <hi>Ezra</hi> 6. 10. Thus our King has given encouragement to build the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, we should Pray for Him for His Life, and Pray for His Family. And when we Pray for our Nation, shall we not Pray for our selves, for poor distress'd <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>England.</hi> It is well that we have begun the Year with solemn Prayer. If the Harvest should fail, what a Miserable condition shall we be in? If we have Showers from Heaven, it is God that gives them. God says, Zech. 10. 1. <hi>Ask of the Lord rain,</hi> and he will give you Showers of Rain. What shall be done that we may be delivered out of the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous distresses upon us? Alas! for the Sins of <hi>New-England.</hi> Alas! for the Sins of <hi>Boston;</hi> What unreasonable Oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is in the midst of us? The Merchant

Oppressing the People in the Country, the People in the Country Oppressing the People in <hi>Boston:</hi> but who does the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression chiefly fall upon? Not so much upon the Rich, as upon the poor; the poor are like to be crushed to death Alas! that there are the Sins of <hi>Sodom</hi> among us! Many in <hi>Boston</hi> are guilty of the Sins of <hi>Sodom.</hi> Is there not <hi>Pride?</hi> Poor People will go beyond their rank, &amp; beyond their ability, which is a great iniquity, and very provoking to God. <hi>Fullness of bread,</hi> and of drink, great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse that way; Drunkenness is become a common Sin among us. <hi>Abundance of Idleness:</hi> There is not that Industry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us as ought to be. How many spend their Time in Taverns; if they spent their Time Industrously, they might live comfortably. When as there are too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that their Wives &amp; Children are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing at home, when they are Idling in Taverns or Publick houses. Alas! Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Boston,</hi> dost thou not see, that Poverty is coming on thee like an armed Man, and that many of thy Houses will be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken and left desolate. Now the great question is, What shall we do that we 
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:002053_0133_0FBA8B7D604BD668"/>
may be extricated out of our difficulties? You say, Blessed is the Man that can tell us what should be done. Some say that if an old Law of the Colony were revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, That no Merchant should ask above Four Pence, or Six Pence in the Shilling for what he Sells, that would bring Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into the Country, and save the Land from ruine. That's a matter out of my Province to meddle with. I have nothing to say about it, but I can tell you of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thing that must be done, and if it be done, God will deliver <hi>Boston,</hi> and <hi>New-England,</hi> out of the dismal straights and difficulties that are upon us: The thing to be done is, to <hi>Repent and Pray.</hi> Don't think Praying alone will do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Repentance, without Reforming and Returning to the Lord; but if you do that, I can assure you in His Name, He will deliver you out of your distresses. I will bring you a plain Scripture for it. Jer. 18. 7, 8. <hi>At what instant I shall speak concerning a Nation, &amp; concerning a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to destroy it; if that Nation against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.</hi> Well then, let there be
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:002053_0134_0FBA8B7EE0E3DC60"/>
that Repenting, that Returning to the Lord that He now expects from us, and we may be sure of it, God will be as good as His Word, and turn from His Anger, and be pleased with us: Only do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay; don't put it off till hereafter, Remember the words of the Prophet: Zeph. 2. 3. <hi>Seek the Lord ye meek of the earth,</hi> before the decree bring forth; <hi>Seek righteousness, seek meekness, it may be ye shall be bid in the day of the Lords anger.</hi> Be in earnest with God. And I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with the words of a Martyr, <hi>Pray, Pray, Pray, never more need than now.</hi>
