            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THESE Eſſays are to be conſidered as only an introductory ſpecimen of a much larger work, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of Letters to a young Lady, on the much neglected ſubject of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Education.—Theſe letters were intended to be compriſed in three ſmall pocket volumes; the firſt recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing religious duties and writers for the culture of the heart; the ſecond proper ſtudies and authors for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the underſtanding; and the laſt pointing out the neceſſary, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic duties, as well as the proper manners, graces and accompliſhments of the ſex.</p>
            <p>The whole work was intended to have made its appearance at the ſame time; but the intervention of other

Nor perhaps, may they now ever ſee the light, though nearly prepared for it, unleſs particularly called for (which he ſcarcely expects) by the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given to theſe preparatory ſketch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.

Here we may ſuppoſe their captivity will ceaſe, and their trampled honour and dignity revive. But this, like many other illuſive hopes, is only form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be diſappointed. It is one of thoſe bright mornings which is quickly overcaſt with darkneſs and clouds.</p>
            <p>It is certain the Greeks were the very patterns of every thing that could be charming and exquiſite in taſte.

            <p>Hitherto I have placed the cauſe of female neglect in the want of a proper civilization and refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and conſidered it as reſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a particular ſtage of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety and manners.

We pity women; and, from views more enlarged than their deſpots had, we even pity or forgive their oppreſſors. If the firſt were degraded, inſulted or enſlaved, candour pleads in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the latter, that no proper ſenſe of duty operated on their conſcience; that revelation had not diſſipated their intellectual darkneſs, or pointed out the awful conſequences of actions; and that they did not know the richneſs or the value of the jewel they deſpiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

            <p>The condition of women in England, no doubt, may juſtly be
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:028263_0054_0FD7F858BB6EB0F0"/>pronounced to be ſupremely hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, if we compare it with what that of many females has been in ſome of the ages, that have juſt paſſed in review before us, or what it <hi>is,</hi> at <hi>preſent,</hi> in moſt countries of the world. They have certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in their allotment <hi>here,</hi> as many obvious advantages, over women in <hi>general,</hi> as Nature has given them a marked ſuperiority of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal beauty, figure and attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. If Europe has been called the <hi>Paradiſe</hi> of the ſex, Britain ſeems to be the choiceſt ſpot of this Paradiſe, in which the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Former has deigned to place the faireſt of the fair, and munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently, to diſtil, upon their favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heads, the richeſt of his ſweets.

Nor in the preſent ſcale of ſociety, do Britiſh ladies want conſiderable weight. Is it the <hi>faſhion</hi> of the times to pay them attentions; and gallantry is planning honours for itſelf, when it ſeems only ſtudious to decorate the brows, and to enhance the conſequence of women.

But let us carefully analyze this ſubject. Let us come to firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and reaſon from facts.</p>
            <p>Till of late years, a very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable negligence prevailed in the culture of their underſtanding.</p>
            <p>It requires no violent effort of memory to recall the period, when there were females, and of no trifling rank, that were not able to compoſe or even <hi>ſpell</hi> a letter with propriety; and though of late, this defect has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably remedied, yet how inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient is the education, which we ſtill, generally give them to fit them to be prudent mothers, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible companions, wiſe and valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble members of ſociety, or (what is moſt of all) thoughtful and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious chriſtians?

            <p>Is this an adequate diſcharge of the parental (that is) the higheſt of all chriſtian and ſocial duties? Can a mother eaſily acquit her conſcience, if a girl thus vitiated from her early years, becomes the ſlave of folly, the plaything of faſhion, the dupe, as ſhe grows up, of ſome inſidious villain, or, at leaſt, the inſipid poiſoner of a connexion, that promiſed every

When ſuch a mother lies upon her death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, will ſhe feel no melancholy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret for a daughter's <hi>paſt,</hi> and no dreadful anticipation of her <hi>future</hi> indiſcretions? Can ſhe bid her the laſt adieu with a compoſed heart, and will not theſe words dart, like a ſunbeam, on her awakened con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, <q>And thou ſhalt teach theſe ſtatutes diligently unto thy children, (of theſe ſurely daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are a part) and ſhalt talk of them, when thou ſitteſt in thine houſe, and when thou walkeſt by the way, and when thou lieſt down and when thou riſeſt up?</q>

               <note n="*" place="bottom">This Eſſay is intended to be a philoſophical theory of the progreſs of love, as unconnected with any particular religion, or indeed with any ſyſtem of Revelation. In moulding this paſſion, moral cauſes will, doubtleſs, have their influence, but the phyſical will, generally, preponderate over all others.</note> THAT the paſſions were implanted in us by the Deity, as the ſprings of all our actions, and are
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:028263_0085_0FD7F8D7DC82A520"/>therefore, in a certain degree, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and lawful, is too obvious a doctrine, in the theory of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, to need any illuſtration.</p>
            <p>Amongſt theſe paſſions, the love of the other ſex is infinitely the ſtrongeſt and the moſt univerſal; and by operating at a time of life, when the character and habits are moſt eſſentially affected, has given riſe to the greateſt revolutions in ſociety, and to ſome of the moſt extraordinary incidents of common life.</p>
            <p>To touch upon the ſubject of love, is gliding with an electrick force and quickneſs, into every boſom. The deſcription of it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fails to create an <hi>univerſal</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, or to arreſt the general at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,

            <p>Love, like all other paſſions, has ſuffered in the wrong opinions, and the perverſe repreſentations of different men. Libertines have degraded it into downright bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,

All other notions of this paſſion, not founded in ſuch philoſophy, will quickly diſappear with the authors, who abet them. The frothy bubble burſts, as ſoon as it is handled.

            <p>This paſſion of love will always receive its particular form and <hi>modification</hi> from the peculiar cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of rudeneſs or civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ization, from the particular cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, government, religion and temperament of the people, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom it is found. The mode, in which love is conſidered, will always preſcribe the method of treating women, who are the objects of it. The light, in which females are viewed, whether of reſpectability or degradation, will
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:028263_0093_0FD7F8EB02E545A0"/>produce their particular kind of <hi>education.</hi> Their education will principally form their character and manners; and, if we conſider the ſtrong and univerſal force of this paſſion, the manners and characters of women will have the ſtrongeſt reciprocal influence on the purſuits and habits, on the complexion and the taſte, on the private and the publick happineſs of any people.</p>
            <p>This ſympathy for the other ſex is then in its proper ſtate of vig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and perfection, when, to that ardour of paſſion, which is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their perſons, we join a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of ſentiment, which eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teems them as companions, as formed to ſoften the ſorrows and misfortunes, and to communicate a zeſt, an elevation and a poignan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to all the real pleaſures and

                  <p>Robert. Hiſt. of Amer. Vol. 1. p. 318.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Stuart, in his hiſtory of Society in Europe, has, in a very maſterly manner, combated this idea of women, in a ſavage condition, being in a ſtate of abject ſervility; but, with all proper de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to his elegant pen, and diſtinguiſhed abil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities, I feel myſelf inclined to think, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances he has adduced, are only ſo many excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which may eaſily be admitted, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the truth or validity of the general rule. His hiſtory of Society in Europe is, however, in my idea, a maſterly ſketch of genius and learning, and ranks him with the firſt writers of the age.</p>
                  <p>Falconer in his Eſſays on the influence of Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, has likewiſe, adopted this opinier. p. 283, For very contrary ſentiments, ſee Ariſt. Pol. Lib. 1. C. 2.</p>

<pb n="97" facs="unknown:028263_0096_0FD7F88FC5033BD0"/>Their charms do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear of ſufficient conſequence to inſtigate the deſire of an excluſive appropriation. Every comer is admitted to their boſoms; and a boſom, ſtruggling with <hi>indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> violence, feels no preference, and can know no diſtinction.</p>
            <p>As ſociety emerges from the infancy of rudeneſs into ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of form, the idea of property
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:028263_0097_0FD7F8F02EF996C8"/>of every ſpecies will begin to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, and <hi>women</hi> will be included in the eſtimation. That deſire, which has laviſhed on the ſex at large, will be confined to a few. Conſidering females, as a ſpecies of treaſure, a man will wiſh to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the ſole, excluſive proprietor of one or more of them, as of any other object, according to the laws and circumſtances of his country. The ſame taſte, which appropriates a fine garden or an eſtate, will prompt him to fill his little <hi>ſer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>glio</hi> with the faireſt of the fair.</p>
            <p>When any people have arrived to a certain degree of knowledge, civilization and politeneſs, women will have all that rational conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, which I have deſcribed. The fineſt feelings of the ſoul will vibrate to their charms, their del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icacy
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:028263_0098_0FD7F8F216A973E0"/>will inſpire attention; their weakneſs will be the ſtrongeſt claim to protection. Love and friendſhip will bow at their ſhrine, and offer them that ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led tribute of ſentiment and of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, which is alone worth their acceptance. The virtue of ſuch an era will both produce and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the purity of their morals, and the purity of their morals will be reflected back on the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, the exiſtence, and proſperity of ſuch a ſtate. This will be the <hi>golden age</hi> of the ſex. It will be the epoch of their triumphs, and their conqueſts.</p>
            <p>I know not whether this idea may be overſtrained, and drawn beyond the line of human imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; but, in revolving over the hiſtory of the world, I feel my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf inclined to doubt, whether

            <p>As proſperity and riches increaſe in a kingdom, the morals of the women, like thoſe of the other ſex will not fail to ſuffer in the gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al corruption. Paſſions, heated by exceſſes, and unreſtrained by religious principles, will be violent and ungovernable; and that lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury, which ſeeks every other ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual pleaſure, will not fail to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve in that, which is confeſſedly the higheſt ſpecies of animal grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ification.

<p>Whatever may be ſaid of the ſublime, moral ſentiments contained in ſome plays, it is certain, that, on the whole, the repreſentations of the ſtage are highly pernicious to the morals of young peb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Such ſentiments, no doubt, are, <hi>occaſionally,</hi> interſperſed through them, but, in fact, ſerve on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as a ſpecious ſweet to gild over the <hi>poiſon,</hi> that lurks beneath. For it is not theſe <hi>ſentiments,</hi> that give to plays the amazing intereſt they have over our hearts. Let any perſon endeavour to recollect the moſt ſerious and ſentimental plays we have in our language, and he will find them, at the ſame time, to be the worſt received of any others in the repreſentation. And what is the reaſon? they have not ſo much of that <hi>love plot</hi> and denouement, they have not enough of that vivid colouring and appeal to the <hi>tender paſſions,</hi> which give theſe entertainments, particularly with young people, ſuch inexpreſſible charms. Can it be pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to <hi>heighten</hi> paſſions, always of themſelves ſufficiently fervid, or to blow up flames, which already rage ſo powerfully, as to threaten the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction of the houſe we live in?</p>
                  <p>Mr. Addiſon has juſtly ſaid, that the ſtage, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der proper regulations, might be made an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſource of entertainment and inſtruction; but, if is was laid under ſuch ſevere reſtrictions, as the chaſtity of this good man's taſte would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, there is reasſon to apprehend, it would ſoon be deſerted.</p>
                  <p>It is true that palys are purified from ſome of their former indecencies; and, that the publick, car would be ſhocked at indelicacies, which, <hi>once,</hi> it heard with the higheſt approbation. But this ſeems more an effect of refinement, than of virtue. we ſtill can bear the <hi>ſentiment,</hi> though we ſhould bluſh at te expreſſion; we love the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity, if it comes but in a cleanly garb. Our taſte, in ſhort, has taught us to ſhudder at all <hi>vulgar</hi> things, (and indelicacy is in the number) whilſt the prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſ of licentious paſſion and the hiſtory of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues, prove that our hearts are not leſſ, but perhaps, more deeply, corrupted. And it is known to be the eſſntial doctrine of Religion, that the "Almighty looketh at the heart and reins."</p>
               </note> will accelerate
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:028263_0101_0FD7F8F692419968"/>the laſt convulſions of virtue, and ſmother the juſt expiring embers of female reſerve. An enervated body in the ſex cannot long reſiſt this extraordinary ferment. An enfeebled mind will not have vig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to ſtruggle with temptation. Marriage will be a burthenſome, and intolerable reſtraint on a rov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inclination. Inconſtancy will
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:028263_0102_0FD7F8FE42D59DD0"/>be frequent, and divorces ſued for as the only reſource, however poor, and however diſgraceful, from an unhappy connexion. A vagrant, ever reſtleſs appetite will pant for variety. Libertiniſm will erect its deſolating ſtandard on the ruins of delicacy; and, in the general per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of taſte, chaſtity will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an unfaſhionable virtue. Such have been moſt nations of antiq<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity in a certain ſtage and progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their empire. Such were Nineveh, Babylon, Tyre, Athens, Rome, in the accumulation of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes; and (not to mention other invidious inſtances) ſuch in ſome degree, at the preſent moment, is the proſperous and opulent iſland of Greatbritain.</p>
            <p>The abſurd and romantick ſpirit of Chivalry never yet totally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, which pays unmean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compliments, where it feels no eſteem, in conjunction with the other cauſes, which have been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerated,
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:028263_0103_0FD7F900E9449B10"/>compoſes that <hi>motley</hi> mixture of attention and neglect, of flattery and contempt, of hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age and of inſult which we extend to the fair. For in fact, whatever a cold hearted politeneſs ſays, or the affectation of ſenſibility may pretend to feel, women in this country, by the majority of men, are conſidered but as inſtruments of vanity and pleaſure. Our love is chiefly faſhion, mixed with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable portion of ingredient, which it would be improper and indelicate to name. The latter we gratify with thoſe unhappy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whoſe ruined character re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires no reparation; and for the firſt, we ſhift attentions, in an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs rotation, with thoſe more il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious names, whoſe faſhiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs can give <hi>eclat</hi> and dignity to our choice, and whoſe fortune has propitiouſly placed them in a rank to reſent our ſeductions. Our eulogies have no ſincerity; our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:028263_0104_0FD7F902949ED6D0"/>have no ardour, no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, no zeſt; we ſeek a pleaſure from the ſex, but we do not find it, becauſe it is not ſought in the <hi>qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities of the heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What but this ſtrange opinion of women, ſanctified by faſhion, and connived at by our penal laws, could have emboldened the worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and puny libertine to boaſt of his triumphs over the innocence of a credulous and tender ſex, whoſe honour it is certainly his buſineſs to guard, and whoſe delicacy to protect? What but the idea of a faſhionable <hi>conſequence</hi> annexed to intrigue, and of credit reſulting from a multiplicity of amours, could have qualified, with any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating ſoftneſs, the natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al horrors, indecency and guilt of violating the marriage bed? What other cauſe could have effectually ſkreened either of theſe characters from the univerſal odium and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy they deſerve? And what elſe
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:028263_0105_0FD7F904822DD0C8"/>could have induced an injured and inſulted ſex <hi>particularly</hi> to careſs theſe aſſaſſins of their peace, and to conſider the number of ſeduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in a man, as ſo many ſcar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of glory, gained in the field of love, which entitled him to ſuperior notice and diſtinction.</p>
            <p>I need not ſtop, a moment, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umerate the evils (for they occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the beginning of this eſſay) reſulting from ſuch a taſte. An abſolute diſſolution, a weakening, or a total prevention of that union which is the very bond and cement of ſociety; ſuſpicion ſubſtituted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the room of confidence, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of attachment; vague and criminal pleaſures, which commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate diſeaſe, which hinder prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agation, and ſuppoſe a total abſence of ſentiment and eſteem; a youth emaciated from early exceſſes, without principles, without conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions and without love, leave a nation nothing to expect but a race
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:028263_0106_0FD7F90689884EC0"/>of puny, ſpiritleſs creatures, ill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to become the defenders of their country, and bearing, on their very characters and faces, every foreboding ſymptom of its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching diſſolution.</p>
            <p>With this ſentiment of women, we are cautious to give them a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding education. It is wholly turned on vanity and trifles, calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated only to embelliſh thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which we wiſh to <hi>enjoy;</hi> to feed that vanity, over which we mean to triumph, and to obſerve that abjectneſs and inferiority of mind, which are favourable to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. Perſon and manner are the great object in the education of this ſex. To render the one beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, and the other enchanting, are our higheſt care. This in gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral, is the employment of the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erneſs. To this are devoted all the labours of the toilet. To this are conſecrated their mornings, and their days. The conſequence is,
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:028263_0107_0FD7F90956D96168"/>that they dazzle or inflame the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but convey no joy or reliſh to the heart. The <hi>artificial</hi> flower has no ſmell or eſſence! The paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>ſtatue</hi> has no ſoul or animation.</p>
            <p>The company of women, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be their taſte, will always, in a greater or leſs degree, be court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the other ſex. With the vain and faſhionable, it has paſſed into a <hi>ſyſtem,</hi> to devote a very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able portion of his hours to the fair, and it is generally eſteemed a nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſary ſtep to politeneſs and the graces.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not ſtop a moment to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the truth or fallacy of this opinion. Suffice it to remark, that in this intercourſe all young men <hi>indiſcriminately,</hi> will endeavour to pleaſe. In order to be agreeable, they muſt have ſuch qualities, as captivate the ſex and converſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſubjects, in which they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted.

            <p>Nor is the loſs of time the only diſadvantage, ariſing from this ſyſtem. The propenſities it gives are unfavourable to every great and magnanimous exertion.</p>
            <p>Young men become inſenſibly <hi>aſſimilated</hi> to the frivolouſneſs they addreſs, and affect to admire; and that frivolouſneſs extends itſelf to all their habits and modes of thinking, to all their deſigns and all their undertakings, to all their actions and intercourſe with the world. They get modes of levity, effeminacy and diſſipation, which
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:028263_0111_0FD7F913DA203B80"/>are equally incompatible with the acquirement of ſcience, or the laborious efforts of virtue. Their purſuits of every kind will be mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this <hi>frivolity.</hi> The youth, which ſhould be the glory of a nation, will become its reproach. Inſtead of climbing, with arduous labour, the ſacred hill of virtue or of learning, they will endeavour to transform and <hi>remodify</hi> their nature, and take up with ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect fragments of both, as they are able to find in the boſom of pleaſure, or the inglorious vale of indulgence. Such a revolution this age has experienced. This expedient has been <hi>ridiculouſly</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted. Phiſoſophy has reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its <hi>uſual</hi> ſternneſs, and dropped in, abſtracted language to pleaſe the <hi>Ladies.</hi> Authors, in general, affect to lie upon the toilet.

            <p>I have not enumerated half the evils of this faſhion. If it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents many marriages, it robs thoſe, which do exiſt, of all their ſweetneſs and all their joys.</p>

<pb n="114" facs="unknown:028263_0113_0FD7F917AEF4C850"/>into ſocial enjoyment, and that the ſweets of friendſhip and the luxury of confidence leave us nothing to deſire but their ſtabil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and their duration. How does the moſt diſtant proſpect of ſuch a ſtate, amidſt the toils of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, the wrinkles of care, and the agonies of diſappointment, charm the moſt elevated and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etrating mind! How often has it adminiſtered courage to the hero, eloquence to the ſenator, and how equally do the monarch and the peaſant court it, as a relaxation from their toils! The tender inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of Hector with Andromache, immortalized by Homer, and the modeſt, timid ſhrinking Aſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anax from his helmet, are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which the pureſt virtue may acknowledge for her own, and which the greateſt Scholars, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erals
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:028263_0114_0FD7F92451C4C460"/>or Politicians need not bluſh to accept as a recompence for their fatigues! How pleaſing to reſign the ſceptre and the laurel for the ſoftneſſes of ſuch an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, the careſſes of ſuch a friend; and to forget, in the affection of a virtuous woman, tumults, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts, diſappointment and the world!</p>
            <p>But let not fancy dream over all the bliſs of ſuch a ſcene, to be awakened only in diſappointment. The <hi>preſent</hi> education of women blaſts this proſpect, and deſtroys ſuch an hope. Senſible men, if they be determined to form this connexion, muſt do it <hi>often</hi> to a diſadvantage.

Marriage is nothing more than a bare, ceremonious union of hands. This ſeeming paradiſe of ſweets, will roughen, as we approach it, into a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thorns. The ſenſes are ſoon palled.

            <p>Though faſhion may ſanctify ſuch a ſcandalous inattention, and ſhe may limit the horizon of good and evil, of virtue and of vice by the applauſes or the cenſures, by the cuſtoms and extravagancies of a licentious age, yet the moment is at hand, when ſhe muſt think that a daughter, ſtepping into a world of ſeduction and of ſnares, needed every ſalutary caution, and every prudent admonition; that a woman formed to be the miſtreſs of a family, ſhould have had her accompliſhments mixed with <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial qualities</hi> and <hi>domeſtick at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention;</hi> that a woman expoſed,

            <p>If a mother can think that there is not only an unnatural indecen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,

Such maternal culture, ſuch a revolution in the ſentiments and conduct of that ſex, would be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the happieſt advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. An alteration would ſoon be viſible on the face of ſociety.</p>
            <p>If the minds of women were placed upon ſolid objects, by a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious and early culture, they would become at once the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and bleſſing, as <hi>now</hi> there is but too much reaſon to apprehend, that they are only the bane and corrupters of ſociety. Their charms would be the ſtimulating prize of valour, merit, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. Their converſation would be a ſoft, but powerful ſpur to every noble action; and, in the intervals, which would be <hi>then</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to their company, the ſoul would be acquiring an elaſticity
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:028263_0123_0FD7F942B238B468"/>and a vigour for every great and dignified undertaking.</p>
            <p>Little do women know of their own <hi>real</hi> intereſts, if they do not think themſelves eſſentially inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted in ſuch a revolution. They would <hi>then</hi> be approached with eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem and veneration. The froth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ineſs of compliment would, grad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually, be changed into the language of truth. Their empire over our hearts, then, founded on the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable qualities of the mind, would be glorious and permanent, not ſubject to expire in the wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles of age, or wither with the tranſient roſes of beauty. Their converſation would give chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and delicacy of ſentiment; and ours would give inſtruction. There would be a gentle conflict and emulation of talents, and both parties would be mutually
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:028263_0124_0FD7F944632F9D38"/>improved by the mutual colliſion. Their friendſhip would be courted, and our <hi>morals</hi> would be improved.

            </p>
            <p>We ſhould <hi>dare</hi> to converſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>rational</hi> ſubjects, and they would liſten with attention. They would not expect that extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant homage, which ſteals our time, as well as our attention from elevated purſuits. They would incite us to great and noble at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievments in the ſenate or the camp, in ſcience and the arts; and their glory would conſiſt (as it always ſhould) in ſharing our diſtinctions. The <hi>petit maitre</hi> would dwindle into his native in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificance.
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:028263_0125_0FD7F9455DFFCB58"/>Without qualities to procure the eſteem of one ſex, this poor, <hi>amphibious</hi> animal would juſtly become the deriſion of the other.

Milton, if we conſider the peculiar difficulties of his ſubject, poſſeſſed both theſe fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulties in a very wonderful degree of perfection. His imagination, however, predominated over the other. Shakeſpeare with his aſtoniſhing imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſometimes erred in judgement, but was it not by way of accommodation to the popular taſte? The compariſon, in point of genius, betwixt Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro and Demoſthenes will, probably, lie in favour of the latter. He had more of that true aetherial fire, which peculiarly deſerves the name, though the latter yields not to him in point of taſte or correctneſs.
<p>Amongſt the French, Rouſſeau had an ardent, but an ungoverned fancy: Originality was his <hi>forte,</hi> but its fallies were wonderfully wild and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrick. Voltaire, on the other hand, had more taſte, than fancy. Arioſto's Imagination was ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to his judgment. Taſſo abounds with tinſel, which wants the pruning aſſiſtance of a ſober judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a corrected taſte. Though the philoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophy of Sir Iſaac Newton had been previouſly ſketched out by the all comprehenſive mind of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, ſtill he made ſuch amazing improvements in it, as to be entitled to the praiſe of a firſt rate genius, and certainly united both the eſſential qualities of the character in a ſtupendous degree. Mr. Locke's invention cannot be doubted, and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle cenſure, I think, can lie againſt his judgement.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt painters, Correggio excelled more in colouring, than deſign; he had greater judgment, than imagination. Rubens, on the other hand, had more invention than judgement. Michael An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo had great invention, but ſometimes erred againſt propriety in taſte. Raphael ſeems to have united all the diſtinguiſhing qualities of genius in his profeſſion. But parallels would be endleſs, and theſe examples are only produced to ſhew, how rarely, even in the greateſt men, theſe ſepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, and, ſeemingly, diſcordant excellencies are united.</p>

            <p>Let us, however, look more <hi>nearly</hi> at the contraſt. Women then have a more brilliant fancy, a quicker apprehenſion, and a more exquiſite taſte. When they apply theſe faculties to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

            <p>But whether it ariſes from an <hi>original</hi> defect in their frame and conſtitution, whether it is that an unquiet imagination and ever reſtleſs ſenſibility afford not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity or <hi>leiſure</hi> enough for <hi>deep</hi> meditation, it is very certain, that they cannot, like the men, arrange, combine, abſtract, purſue diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy a long train of ideas, and in every thing, that requires the more <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> talents, muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to a ſtrong and a marked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriority.
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:028263_0142_0FD7F97B831B70D0"/>The truth is, that reſtleſſneſs of ſenſibility, and that inquietude of imagination, which debar the poſſibility of great at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, were providentially deſigned to compoſe the very life and eſſence of their graces.

Were they not the petty intereſts of as petty a territory, whoſe views and wants terminated chiefly in itſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out looking into any other quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the globe? Did they ever require that univerſal penetration, that comprehenſiveneſs of reſearch, that ſtretch and vigour of thought, that wonderful combination of ſchemes and ideas, that retroſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and anticipation, that bringing paſt and preſent into one common point of view, which the immenſe, diffuſive, complicated concerns of large, extended kingdoms, at the <hi>preſent</hi> period, and in the <hi>modern</hi> cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of Europe, abſolutely demand? It will follow from the obſervations, likewiſe, that have been already made in this eſſay, that women are not calculated to

They were not formed to hold the reins of empire, to penetrate into the views and wants, or adjuſt the various and complicated intereſts of conflicting ſtates.

            <p>Nor let the ſex ſuppoſe me their accuſer or their foe. If I have not wholly <hi>miſtaken</hi> the method, I mean to be their advocate and friend. I have left them the ſeeds of every thing, that pleaſes and

They were perpetually to pleaſe, and perpetually to enliven. If we were to plan the edifice, they were to furniſh the <hi>embelliſhments.</hi> If we were to lay out and cultivate the garden, they were beautifully to <hi>fringe</hi> its borders with flowers, and fill it with perfume. If we were deſtined to ſuperintend the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement</hi> of kingdoms, they were to be the faireſt <hi>ornaments</hi> of thoſe kingdoms, the embelliſhers of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and the ſweeteners of life.</p>

Women were not formed for political em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inence or literary refinement. The ſoftneſs of their nature, the delicacy of their frame, the timid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of their diſpoſition and the modeſty of their ſex, abſolutely diſqualify them for ſuch difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and exertions. Their deſtiny of bearing and nurſing children, the neceſſity of ſuperintending do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick concerns, and the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar diſeaſes, to which they are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, leave them little time for ſuch publick undertakings, whilſt the humble offices in which they are engaged, confer a bleſſing and a benefit upon ſociety, that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely beyond the <hi>coldneſs</hi> of

The woman of the cloiſter would grant the graces of a citizen of the world. In that ardour of underſtanding, which rouſes emulation, ſhe would loſe that ſoothing manner, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliates and endears.

So far as the qualities of the <hi>heart</hi> are concerned (and this has, ſometimes formed a part of the queſtion) I think the ſexes will not bear a compariſon.

            <p>In the liſt, which Scripture has given us of converts to Chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, in the very early ages, we meet with holy women, not a few,
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:028263_0157_0FD7F9CB66FDC408"/>The fathers of the Romiſh church maintained an opinion, which was borrowed, no doubt, from cloſe obſervation, that the number of <hi>glorified</hi> females in heaven, would exceed that of men; and monaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries can produce their <hi>thouſands</hi> of this ſex, who, impelled by a holy, though miſguided zeal, have ſacrificed beauty, fortune, friends; every thing that could <hi>charm</hi> and every thing that could engage, for the lonelineſs of a convent and the rigid auſterities of a <hi>perpetual</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion!</p>
            <p>It has been ſaid that women are more <hi>artful,</hi> and fond of ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge than the men, and perhaps there may be ſome degree of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and authenticity in the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. But does not this ariſe from the juſt and neceſſary jeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſy
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:028263_0158_0FD7F9CC5BC2E348"/>they entertain of the other ſex, and from the cruel taſk we impoſe upon them, of not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether in the guiſe of a friend they may not meet with a betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and a foe? If a woman has not reſerve upon <hi>many</hi> occaſions, we criminate and deſpiſe her; if ſhe <hi>has,</hi> we load it with the odious name of artifice and diſſimulation. In ſo rigorous a ſyſtem, we do not leave her the <hi>poſſibility</hi> of eſcaping without cenſure. Either ſhe is called a <hi>prudiſh</hi> hypocrite, or ſhe is called <hi>indiſcreet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we carry our reſearches through the whole creation, we ſhall find, that, as any creature is deficient in ſtrength, it is always furniſhed with a proportionate ſhare of art and contrivance; and a little more reflection will ſerve to convince us, that ſuch is the
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:028263_0159_0FD7F9CDCFC7B028"/>all wiſe appointment of the Deity, and that theſe <hi>inferior</hi> qualities are abſolutely neceſſary to its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence and preſervation.</p>

<pb n="162" facs="unknown:028263_0161_0FD7F9D3E479B908"/>Life is inſipid, and her ſoul has no joy! Her fancy conjures up a thouſand apprehenſions. In her <hi>few,</hi> ſlumbering moments ſhe dreams of his danger, and ſhe ſtarts, at once from thought and repoſe! Every billow is his grave! Every traveller is beſmeared with the blood of the endeared abſent! How deſpicable is the villain, who can betray ſo much fondneſs; how inſenſible is the ſoul, that can laugh at ſo much tenderneſs; and how execrable is that faſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, which ſubſtitutes, in its place, the windings of art and the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of affectation!</p>
            <p>At the ſame time, if the merit of virtue is to be eſtimated (as it always ſhould) from the ſtrength or the weakneſs of the determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>motives,</hi> how much ſuperior is
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:028263_0162_0FD7F9D48FC80DE8"/>woman's! The love of fame, rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, honour, conſequence, give birth to almoſt all great atchievements that diſtinguiſh our own ſex. If a man be celebrated for valour, ſcience, enterprize, he is received into all companies with eulogies. His <hi>Sovereign</hi> applauds. <hi>Theatres</hi> welcome him with burſts of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. In the countenance of his admiring friends, he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally reads his glory and his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and, when he dies, <hi>hiſtory</hi> ſheds over his unperiſhable mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory, an <hi>immortal</hi> perfume.</p>
            <p>Not ſo with women. <hi>Their</hi> virtues, exerciſed in <hi>ſolitude</hi> and ſpringing purely from the <hi>heart,</hi> make no noiſe, and court no obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Laviſhed chiefly on their children and their friends, they blaze not on the world, nor are

            <p>Still let not theſe degrading fair ones deſpond. Let them not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of their humiliating lot. Whilſt virtue, taſte, ſenſibility or diſcernment remain in the world, they will always have a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of influence and reſpect.

The ſervices they do to ſociety, though not trumpeted by fame, are recorded by gratitude, and graven on the heart; and they ſhare in the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and diſtinctions of the men.

            <p>HOW far a publick or a private education is moſt to be preferred, is an enquiry, that has
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:028263_0167_0FD7F9E68E4E8578"/>agitated the curioſity, and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the pens of many diſtinguiſhed writers both of ancient and mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern times. From the days of Quintilian to the preſent moment, plauſible things have been frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advanced in favour of both, and attacked with as many and forcible objections. Some, indeed, ſeem to have undertaken the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject only from a partial, ſelfiſh principle of recommending the plan, which was beſt accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their own private intereſts or peculiar ſituation, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the various theories, that have prevailed, the general opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion ſeems conſiderably unfixed; at leaſt, both ſchemes are <hi>indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately</hi> adopted, as other, collateral circumſtances of fortune, conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, connexion or accident in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and direct.</p>

Without entering at all into the <hi>detail</hi> of the argument, or attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to appreciate the ſeparate mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its of the different reaſoners, a ſenſible mind forms this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that a private education is more favourable to <hi>morals,</hi> that young people at leaſt, ſhould nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er be truſted to the dangerous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of publick ſchools, till principles and even <hi>habits</hi> of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue have had time to <hi>take ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Whilſt an exorbitant profuſion, and extravagance of expenſe, in almoſt all other caſes, characterize the kingdom, the education of children, though an object of the higheſt, <hi>private</hi> and <hi>national</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, is an article, which we treat with the moſt <hi>abject</hi> and ill judged parſimony, except only, in thoſe circumſtances which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to <hi>frivolouſneſs, accompliſhments</hi> or conceit, to a dancing, a muſick, or a fencing maſter, who are to teach them<note n="*" place="bottom">I would not here be underſtood, as intending to throw a ſtigma on any of the pleaſing qualities or accompli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In general, the youth at publick ſchools, attend <hi>too little</hi> to them; and, whether it ariſes from the ignorance and aukwardneſs of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptors themſelves, from ſo many boys being grouped together without any of the <hi>ſofter</hi> ſex to temper their ferocity, from their being ſo whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſwallowed up with the ſeverer ſtudies, that they have little leiſure for mixing in good company, or from the notion of an <hi>effeminacy,</hi> annexed in all claſſick writers, to theſe <hi>little attentions</hi>—whatever be the cauſe, nothing is a more common ſight, than the union of an excellent <hi>Claſſick,</hi> and a <hi>baſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, aukward, or uncivil clown</hi> in the very ſame perſon. Such a ſpectacle degrades, diſhonours and raiſes prejudices againſt learning; at the ſame time, graces are ſurely but an <hi>inferior</hi> and <hi>ſecondary</hi> conſideration, whilſt ſolid improvement, knowledge and virtue ſhould always be the <hi>firſt.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>graces,</hi> and initiate
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:028263_0170_0FD7F9EA557BADF8"/>them in all the <hi>petits</hi> trifles of faſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ionable life.</p>
            <p>Circumſtanced as we are, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſchools are the only poſſible, <hi>general</hi> receptable for the educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of youth; and, as we pay the teachers, in order that a perſon may not ſtarve by his profeſſion, theſe ſeminaries muſt contain ſuch numbers of young people, as it is impoſſible for him to tend with
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:028263_0171_0FD7F9EC8EC599D8"/>any adequate vigilance, ſo as either to know their <hi>diſpoſitions</hi> or their <hi>talents,</hi> their virtues or their vices.</p>
            <p>Hence men of any liberal ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, or any decent fortune will not ſubmit to the <hi>humiliating</hi> taſk. Hence (excepting in a few publick ſchools, endowed by the munificence of our more virtuous anceſtors, and requiring a gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate from the univerſities) maſters, in general, are but poorly quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for the office they aſſume; and hence an employment, in itſelf the moſt elevated and honourable of all others, in its tendency the moſt uſeful and important to the ſtate, in the eye of religion and of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened reaſon, requiring the ſtrongeſt union of goodneſs and of talents, and, in the ſounder policy of the ancients, devolving only on the moſt diſtinguiſhed and
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:028263_0172_0FD7F9F660C3DCF8"/>unexceptionable characters, is ſunk amongſt the <hi>frivolous and diſſipated</hi> moderns, into conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſrepute, whilſt its profeſſors intitled to the publick gratitude, generally meet with little but the publick contempt.</p>
            <p>Let it not be ſaid, that their <hi>manners</hi> have deſerved it. Let it not be urged that their ignorance of life and cuſtoms, their rudeneſs, their pedantry, their carrying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſociety the imperiouſneſs of a ſchool, and expecting indiſcrim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inately from the people they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with, the homage paid by pupils to their deſpotick throne, have been the real cauſe of ſuch an odious ſtigma thrown upon their order. Though the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting of a ſchool is not favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the temper or manners, yet a perſon of <hi>real</hi> education and
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:028263_0173_0FD7F9F7F274B7B0"/>good ſenſe, will generally riſe, in his intervals of relaxation, above ſuch little diſadvantages; but, if our <hi>avarice</hi> forces others, and of a lower caſt, into this department it is our avarice, chiefly, that ſhould be blamed for their foibles and defects.</p>
            <p>With regard to women, I do not know that this famous queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about a publick or private education has ever been agitated. Indeed it is not neceſſary. Though ſuch parents, as think of being generous and liberal, ſeldom fail to give them the firſt, yet the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in the eſtimate of ſober reaſon, is certainly to be preferred; and, whatever elegant or high ſounding ſchools may be ſought out for a girl, yet a mother ſeems the only governeſs, intended by nature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="175" facs="unknown:028263_0174_0FD7F9F94DD1A4B8"/>
Three principal advantages of publick ſchools for boys are; 1ſt. That they cure a timid baſhfulneſs, and eſtabliſh a confidence, ſo nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſary for any publick character or employment; 2dly. That they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite a proper emulation by the colliſion of talents; and 3dly. That they foſter early, laſting friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, ſometimes of a powerful kind, which frequently lead the way to worldly honour and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe effects will not, by a <hi>judicious</hi> friend, be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to women. Confidence, in them, "is a horrid bore;" and let a ſilly faſhion ſuggeſt what it will, their ſweeteſt graces are the crimſoning <hi>bluſh</hi> and the retiring <hi>timidity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to emulation, there are often children enough in their own fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily,
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:028263_0175_0FD7F9FC8190F488"/>or in the circle of their near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt acquaintance to communicate the ſpirit, ſo far as it is <hi>neceſſary</hi> or uſeful amongſt thoſe, who are not to hold the reins of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the offices of ſtate, or the poſt of a commander, and who cannot aſpire to ſacred greatneſs in the honours of the purple.</p>
            <p>The laſt effect is ſuperſeded, likewiſe, by the nature of their ſex; as the grand promotion, of which <hi>they</hi> are capable, is a dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified marriage, which their <hi>ſiſter</hi> acquaintance are not capable of conferring; which a publick life is not likely to enſure, and which they will always have the greateſt chance of forming to advantage, of they rather court the ſhade of a meritorious <hi>retirement,</hi> than the intoxicating notice of the <hi>publick eye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="177" facs="unknown:028263_0176_0FD7FA02773A13A8"/>
So far, therefore, from their receiving any ſolid <hi>advantages</hi> from this method of expoſure, I conceive that it often ſubjects girls to numerous inconveniencies, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and temptations, which their early age, and yet unripened vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue are not always found ſufficient to reſiſt.</p>
            <p>Thrown together in ſhoals, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one common reſervoir, at a <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous</hi> age, when nature bids an unuſual fervour riſe in their blood, when they feel themſelves ſprung into a new epoch of exiſtence, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated with ſimilar feelings and ſimilar deſires, and when a reſtleſs leiſure awakens all the powers of imagination and the ſenſes, they inſenſibly convey an infection to each other by tales of <hi>ſentiment, ſympathy</hi> and <hi>friendſhip,</hi> and by various communications, ſchemes
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:028263_0177_0FD7FA059C6A1BE0"/>and artifices, which the vigilance of no governeſs is able to diſcover, nor her power to ſuppreſs. In the heat of imagination, her reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traints are conſidered as but a <hi>prudiſh</hi> bar to the <hi>only ſolid hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in life;</hi> a connexion with the other ſex. In the taſte of a licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious age, viewing paſſion, as a <hi>buſineſs;</hi> in the <hi>fervour</hi> of nature, feeling it as an inſtinct; and, in the inexperience of youth, fancy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it a paradiſe, in which are no thorns, a country, whoſe land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcapes are all real, as they are beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, they behold an <hi>enemy</hi> in the woman, who reſtrains them, and have recourſe to every private me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of breaking through the chains, the deſpotiſm and formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities of their temporary <hi>convents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence, from ſo many offenſive breaths all pent up together, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:028263_0178_0FD7FA07901923B8"/>a total putrefaction of the moral air. Hence ſwarms of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels to inflame their fancy, and effectually to pave the way for their future ſeduction. Hence private correſpondences, aſſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and intrigue. Hence levity, giddineſs and a total forfeiture of that delicacy and ſoftneſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which it is impoſſible for any woman to be lovely, or to ſecure the <hi>eſteem,</hi> whilſt ſhe engages the <hi>partiality</hi> of an impaſſioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder.</p>
            <p>If I have <hi>exaggerated</hi> in the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription, let experience contradict me. If I have ſaid the truth, the prejudices or the intereſts of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular individuals ſhould not be regarded.</p>
            <p>The qualities, which every man of real taſte and ſenſe wiſhes, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, to find in a woman, are
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:028263_0179_0FD7FA090D99F2E8"/>innocence, ſimplicity and domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick worth. To theſe he would ſacrifice all the <hi>fanciful</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments. They are to ſoothe his ſorrows, they are to bleſs his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage and ſweeten his retirement.</p>
            <p>Boarding ſchools wholly coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teract theſe diſpoſitions. They trample upon nature, and give us artificial creatures, artificial looks and artificial ſmiles. In their formal walls, airs, geſtures, ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, articulation, all are ſtudied, and are ſure to diſguſt. Like hot beds, they give a <hi>forwardneſs</hi> to fruits, but deprive them of their natural healthineſs and flavour; and the <hi>fine ladies</hi> they ſend into the world, feel themſelves ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y exalted above (what they conceive to be) the <hi>groveling</hi> offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of family economy, or domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick attentions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="181" facs="unknown:028263_0180_0FD7FA0AE2CB16D8"/>
If women wiſh to pleaſe, they ſhould conſider that nothing <hi>can</hi> pleaſe long, but the ſimplicity of nature; at the ſame time, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves them to remember, that they were certainly born for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more <hi>important,</hi> and that when the ſhort reign of their charms, ſhall expire, they will be able to procure a <hi>durable</hi> eſteem by nothing but the ſolid qualities, and the domeſtick virtues. The miſtreſs of a family is no longer a girl; and, if men are to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh themſelves by buſineſs, or letters, by enterprize, or valour, females are ſurely called on, in their turn, by motives of gratitude and a dignified ambition, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalize themſelves, if poſſible, within their own walls, and to tend, with unremitting care and vigilance, the little tender pledges
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:028263_0181_0FD7FA0C17D9ED30"/>of their mutual affection. What ſays the wiſe man? "A good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man looketh well to the ways of her houſehold, and all her family is clothed in ſcarlet."</p>
            <p>Whatever <hi>undomeſticates</hi> a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſo far unmakes her, as to all the valuable purpoſes of her exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and is at once the bane of her uſefulneſs, her happineſs and virtue. It rifles her of her ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, ſenſibility, delicacy and of all the ſweeteſt of her vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and of her graces. It is <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domeſticated</hi> women, that poiſon the ſources of our ſweeteſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. It is <hi>undomeſticated</hi> women, that have houſes without any order or arrangement, ſervants without diſcipline, and children, without inſtruction; that are friends, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out friendſhip, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, and parents, without af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. And it is, I conceive, a
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:028263_0182_0FD7FA0F49A84270"/>publick education, which firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires the rage for pleaſure and diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation.</p>
            <p>Almoſt every thing <hi>in</hi> and <hi>about</hi> theſe ſeminaries, has a tendency to corrupt the heart. What is it theſe fair pupils are taught to pant for? Admiration. What is propoſed as the higheſt object, the <hi>ne plus ultra</hi> of all their endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours? Admiration. What are conſidered as the ſteps to it? El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>egant dreſs, appearance, equipage, wit, ſmartneſs, dancing, ſinging. In the mean time what becomes of the <hi>love of God,</hi> which Chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity repreſents, as the <hi>firſt</hi> of duties? How little do they ſtudy the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of their ſaviour, who was meek and lowly in heart? Where, all this while, is the mortification, and religious government of their paſſions, indifference to the world,
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:028263_0183_0FD7FA0F4C4C50C0"/>the diſcipline of their heart, thoughts, and imagination, mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſty, humility, heavenly minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and all the lovely train of chriſtian and evangelical graces? With <hi>ſuch</hi> impreſſions, how vain and <hi>groveling</hi> muſt be the heart! How full of petty <hi>jealouſies,</hi> and paltry <hi>competitions!</hi> How cloſed to all the nobler ſentiments and <hi>affections,</hi> and how great a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to any ſolid, or any perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent repoſe!</p>
            <p>Without unreaſonably ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the abilities of a governeſs, it is impoſſible ſhe ſhould attend to the prodigious number of young people ſhe receives, ſo as to diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er their infinite varieties of talents or diſpoſitions; and it may be preſumed, from the nature of things, that ſhe will not be often equal to the arduous undertaking.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="185" facs="unknown:028263_0184_0FD7FA156FEE6A90"/>
It will be allowed me without controverſy, that, in every educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, principles of <hi>religion</hi> and <hi>virtue</hi> ſhould form the great and <hi>primary</hi> conſideration. Without theſe, all other qualities and all other accompliſhments are but a ſpecious ſtructure, raiſed on the ſand, which muſt totter in the moment of ſorrow and of trial. But, to inſtil theſe in the beſt and moſt effectual manner; to illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate them with the moſt proper images and embelliſhments; to <hi>diverſify</hi> her efforts according to the endleſs variety and taſte of her fair pupils; to communicate her knowledge and virtue, in ſuch a manner as to make them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, ſeem a roſe without a thorn, requires no ordinary talents and exertions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="186" facs="unknown:028263_0185_0FD7FA18EA0FA788"/>
To accompliſh ſuch an end, a governeſs, in the firſt place, ſhould be a <hi>prodigy of virtue.</hi> Like char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, "ſhe ſhould ſuffer long and be kind." She ſhould deny herſelf pleaſure, eaſe, ſlumber, <hi>ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery thing</hi> for the ſake of her ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der flock. She ſhould love them, as her daughters, and conſider herſelf engaged in the noble em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of training up ſo many angels for the ſkies.</p>
            <p>She ſhould have great know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and that knowledge ſhould be embelliſhed with taſte. It ſhould appear, like the fair ones, to whom it is recommended, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>lovely,</hi> and always <hi>inviting.</hi> She ſhould know the beſt books, and ſhe ſhould be able to diſcrim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inate and ſelect the moſt <hi>ſtriking</hi> and <hi>intereſting</hi> paſſages for their inſtruction.</p>

               <pb n="187" facs="unknown:028263_0186_0FD7FA1A51E3D968"/>
Her addreſs, likewiſe, ſhould be conſpicuous above all her other qualities. She ſhould be able to ſee the heart in all its foldings and receſſes. She ſhould know how to <hi>multiply</hi> and <hi>variegate</hi> herſelf, as exigencies require; here ſhe ſhould ſooth, and there ſhe ſhould expoſtulate; here ſhe ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to affect by the ſpirited, and there by the pathetick; in one place, ſhe ſhould be gentle like the dew, in another, <hi>thunder, lightning</hi> and <hi>ſtorms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It would diſplay a great igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of human nature to ſuppoſe, that ſuch a combination of great talents is frequently to be met with in <hi>any</hi> female; and it would argue a ſtill higher degree of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity and inexperience to expect them <hi>concentred</hi> in the character of ſuch a one, as generally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:028263_0187_0FD7FA1C87BC06B8"/>this particular employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>So little is the eſteem, in which the character of <hi>Governeſs,</hi> like that of <hi>Schoolmaſter,</hi> is held, and ſo inadequate are the rewards, conferred on theſe people, that the office, in the <hi>beſt</hi> point of view, will, very frequently, devolve upon thoſe, who, having once ſeen bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter days, but now fallen from their dignity, have contracted not a little of that deſpondency and <hi>ſourneſs,</hi> which attend degradation; and, in the worſt, will, as often be undertaken, as a laſt <hi>reſource,</hi> by many, who are not famous for the <hi>liberality</hi> of their ſentiments, as they have not been diſtinguiſhed by that of their <hi>education.</hi> To expect that <hi>ſuch</hi> women ſhould be patterns, either of the <hi>graces</hi> or the <hi>virtues,</hi> would be hoping a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

            <p>Nor do I conceive that Board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Schools have ſuch a tendency, as has generally been imagined, to give the ſo <hi>much valued</hi> excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of politeneſs.</p>
            <p>Without eaſe, there can be no grace. Without grace, there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be politeneſs.

<pb n="190" facs="unknown:028263_0189_0FD7FA215F1438F8"/>we look up to with a degree of deference, and feel ourſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired with the ambition to pleaſe? None of theſe circumſtances <hi>gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally</hi> exiſt in ſchools; and, if there was no other reaſon, either of the ſexes living aloof, and ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arated from the other will always contract a number of peculiarities, ungraceful and unpleaſing. But the <hi>great</hi> conſideration, after all, is virtue. And <hi>female</hi> virtue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears a plant of too delicate a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to bear this ſcorching meth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od of expoſure.</p>
            <p>It will appear from the general complexion of theſe remarks, that they are deſigned, principally, to apply to people in the higher ranks of life. Amongſt others, caſes, doubtleſs, will occur, in which a publick ſchool may have
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:028263_0190_0FD7FA2299671510"/>its advantages, and be the beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource.</p>
            <p>In a flouriſhing, commercial country, like Great Britain, ſome parents will attain, from <hi>very low beginnings</hi> to ſo ample a fortune, as to wiſh their children a much better education, than they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have enjoyed, or are capable of imparting. And it will occur to every reflecting perſon, from the nature of the caſe, that, under <hi>their</hi> roofs, daughters might imbibe only a ſet of illiberal no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or a ſyſtem of vulgar, purſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proud ſuperciliouſneſs. To <hi>ſuch,</hi> theſe ſeminaries, defective as they are, may have their uſes and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
            <p>The ſentiments of <hi>ſuch</hi> girls, as well as their manners, may <hi>here</hi> receive an elevation and refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They may feel themſelves
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:028263_0191_0FD7FA2DE33DAEC8"/>levelled, nay uſefully humbled by the company of their ſuperiors. Little mortifications beget humil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and little ſuperiorities produce ſubordination. The <hi>Queen of the village</hi> may be ſtripped of her u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurped plumes, and inſenſibly taught to treat thoſe with reſpect, whom once ſhe conſidered with ſcorn and averſion. But where mothers are themſelves <hi>equal</hi> to the taſk (if a taſk it muſt be deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) there cannot be a doubt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the difference of advantage, as a matter of <hi>duty,</hi> if all the caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſts of Europe were conſulted, they could not bring the ſhadow of an argument againſt it. No; reaſon, religion, the thrillings of affection, the voice of nature, and the voice of God, the intereſts of ſociety, the happineſs of private life, the honour, the dignity and
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:028263_0192_0FD7FA33F7ED69D0"/>
               <hi>true policy</hi> of woman—all ſay, that a <hi>mother</hi> ſhould be the <hi>preceptreſs</hi> of her children, and that ſuch children would ſtand a chance of the happieſt inſtruction. <q>If well nurtured ſons grow up as young plants, ſuch daughters would be as poliſhed corners of the temple.</q>
