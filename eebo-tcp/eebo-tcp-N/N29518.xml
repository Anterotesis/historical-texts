            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <opener>SHEWETH,</opener>
            <p>THat they were ſent from the Governour, Council and General Aſſembly of His Majesties Province of <hi>New-York</hi> about the Month of <hi>November</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, with an humble Addreſs of Thanks to His Sacred Majeſty, for his Royal Care of and Bounty to that Province, with all dutiful Acknowledgment of their hearty Affection and Zeal to His Majeſty's Perſon and Government.</p>
            <p>That they had alſo Commiſſion and Inſtructions to lay before his Majeſty the State and Condition of that Province, in relation to the War with the French; and further, to move and appear in any matter or thing that may conduce to the Good and Wellfare of that Province.</p>
            <p>That being on heir Voyage hither, in the Month of <hi>January</hi> laſt, near the Iſlands of <hi>Silly,</hi> they were taken by a Privateer of <hi>St Malo,</hi> and carried into France, where they remained Priſoners till the beginning of the Month of <hi>April.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:039317_0002_10141D8F266F9D68"/>That when they found the Ship they were in was not capable of any longer Defence, they ſunk all ſuch Papers and Writings as did any ways concern the Publick or the War.</p>
            <p>That they were inſtructed humbly to offer to and acquaint His Majeſty, That the <hi>French</hi> of <hi>Canada</hi> have Re-ſettled a Fort at a place called <hi>Cadaraque,</hi> from whence they were driven by the Indians, the beginning of the War.</p>
            <p>That ſince the ſaid Settlement, the Indians of the five Nations have ſeemed much colder in their Friendſhip to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and it is to be feared, they will not only ſtrike up a Peace with the <hi>French,</hi> but make open War upon the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That it has not been poſſible for the Governour of <hi>New-York,</hi> with the Forces he has there, to hinder the ſettlement of the <hi>French</hi> at <hi>Cadaraque,</hi> it being ſcituate more than Five Hundred Miles from the uppermoſt Plantations, and the way thither through a Country of thick Woods and great Lakes, without any Road, and where no Proviſions for any conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Party of Chriſtians are to be had.</p>
            <p>That if thoſe Five Nations of <hi>Indians</hi> ſhould be drawn over to the <hi>French,</hi> all the Engliſh Plantations on the Main Land, that are ſettled at great diſtance from one another, will be liable to be wholly Ruined and Deſtroyed by ſmall Parties of <hi>French</hi> and thoſe <hi>Indians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Province of <hi>New-York,</hi> by its Scituation, yearly Preſents and Aſſiſtance given to thoſe Indians, (to the great Impoveriſhing of that Country) has hitherto (except any Defection has happened ſince <hi>November</hi> laſt) with great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty kept thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> from quitting the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt.</p>
            <p>That in that Province, conſiſting of about three Thouſand Families, towards the defraying the Charge of the War, has been raiſed, ſince the year 1690. above 30000 <hi>l.</hi> and all the Aſſiſtance had from the Neighbouring Colonies, has only been about 3000 <hi>l.</hi> though all the <hi>Engliſh Plantations</hi> on the Continent are equally (if not more) concerned in the danger.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:039317_0003_10141D93B96AE210"/>That notwithſtanding ſo much Money has been raiſed from that Province, and the other Aſſiſtance given by its Neighbours, the Expence of the War has been ſo great, that the Government at preſent remains much in debt, and will not be longer able to ſubſiſt, unleſs ſome effectual Methods are found to ſupport it.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Indians</hi> being weary of the War, obſerving the great Recruits of Men, Arms and Stores yearly ſent from <hi>France,</hi> are very ſenſible of the Danger threatned them by the Neighbourhood of the <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Cadaraque,</hi> who are much better fortified there than formerly; and by this they are inclined to hearken to the Propoſals made from thoſe of <hi>Canada,</hi> who by Menaces, Gifts, and other means, endeavour to get thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> to engage on their ſide.</p>
            <p>They humbly therefore pray Your Lordſhips to Intercede with His Majeſty, To order ſome ſpeedy and effectual Care to be taken, that the Evils, which apparently will attend the <hi>Indians</hi> Confederating with the <hi>French,</hi> and their ſettling in thoſe Parts may be prevented.</p>
