            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>WITH a heart deeply impreſſed, with a ſerious belief in the divine originality of the chriſtian diſpenſation: Awed, as in the preſence of the dread Sovereign of the univerſe: to whoſe penetrating eye the ſecrets of all hearts are diſcloſed: And ſenſibly affected, by the ſolemnity of the preſent occaſion: I ſhall addreſs you, my chriſtian friends, in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted, though truly pathetic language of the great Apoſtle Paul to the Epheſians.</p>

                  <p>And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are ſanctified.</p>

IF any conſiderations were ſufficient to control the angry paſſions and blind prejudices of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; to ſubdue the enmity of the human heart; to calm the raging tumults of the troubled breaſt; and cauſe the wrath of man to give place to the tender feelings, and kind affections of friendſhip and brotherly love: ſurely they muſt be thoſe, which are ſuggeſted by that pure and holy reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which originated in the infinite wiſdom, and boundleſs goodneſs of the Almighty.—Which was publiſhed to a fallen world, by Jehovah's firſt-born; recommended to human obſervation in his own perfect example: Which is ſtill urged upon mankind by the life and converſation of every faithful diſclple of Jeſus Chriſt; And by the powerful, though ſilent pleadings of the holy Spirit; And which has for its only objects, the glory of the ever bleſſed God, and the felicity of his intelligent offspring.</p>
               <p>It is the deſign of chriſtianity, to make men benevolent and good here; that they may be happy and glorious hereafter. To accompliſh this all-gracious deſign, the Son of God, for a time, forſook his Father's boſom; and deſcended from his throne, in the higheſt heavens, to the humiliating ſituation of a man deſpiſed upon earth. To every indignity, that the blind malice of an abandoned world could invent, he willingly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. Knowing that to teach and inſtruct man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind by his example and doctrines; and by his ſufferings and death to redeem and ſave them;

were the great and important purpoſes to be gained by his miſſion; he patiently received the full vials of divine wrath, which were prepared for him.</p>
               <p>With an uniform ſubmiſſion to his Father's will, and with a ſingle aim to the glory of the Godhead, in the ſalvation of ſinners; he ſteadily purſued the thorny path, which led through every ſpecies of ſuffering and abuſe, from his manger to his croſs. "He was deſpiſed and rejected of men, he was indeed, a man of ſorrow and acquainted with grief." Yet mark his deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! "He was oppreſſed and he was afflicted; yet he opened not his mouth. He was brought as a lamb to the ſlaughter, and as a ſheep before her ſhearers is dumb, ſo he opened not his mouth. When he was reviled, he reviled not again. When he ſuffered he threatened not; but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted himſelf to him that judgeth righteouſly." And when nailed to the accurſed tree; amidſt the inſults of an unfeeling multitude; as he bowed his ſacred head in death, his ſpotleſs ſoul aſcended to the throne of grace, with this ſervent ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, for thoſe who ſpilt his blood. <q>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Such, my friends, was the Maſter whom the Apoſtle was miraculouſly called to ſerve. And ſuch were the examples in patience and reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which were propoſed for his imitation. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

This certainly is a ſacred, and a moſt important truſt. Sufficient to exerciſe the diſtinguiſhed abilities, and to juſtify the zeal of this truly great man, and faithful diſciple of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Next to his divine Maſter, perhaps no indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual has ever done more, to promote the dignity and happineſs of human nature, than the Apoſtle Paul. And excepting Chriſt, perhaps no one ever met with more ungrateful returns for all his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices and his ſufferings than he did. His hiſtory, commencing with his converſion to chriſtianity, is filled with a ſeries of ſurpriſing exertions in the cauſe of Chriſt; And with affecting repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of the cruel and barbarous treatment he ſuffered from thoſe, whoſe eternal intereſt he endeavoured to promote, at the expenſe of every worldly conſideration. He does himſelf the juſtice to ſay, that he is in nothing a whit behind the chiefeſt Apoſtles. <q>Are they miniſters of Chriſt (ſaid he) I am more: in labours more abundant, in ſtripes above meaſure, in priſons more frequent, in deaths oft. Of the Jews five times received I forty ſtripes ſave one. Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I ſtoned, thrice I ſuffered ſhipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep: In journeying often, in perils of waters; in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderneſs, in perils in the ſea, in perils amongſt falſe brethren. In wearineſs and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:025565_0009_0FCDFDB8EAE4CA08"/>
in watchings often, in hunger and thirſt, in faſtings often, in cold and nakedneſs.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe were the rewards which an ungrateful world had to beſtow upon one of the brighteſt ornaments of human nature. Upon one of the moſt faithful and deſerving of the ſons of men. Theſe were the evidences which St. Paul pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced of his Apoſtleſhip. <q>Therefore (ſaid he) I take pleaſure infirmities, in reproaches, in diſtreſſes, in neceſſities, in perſecutions, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes for Chriſt's ſake: for when I am weak, then am I ſtrong. And truly (added he) the ſigns of an Apoſtle were wrought among you in all patience.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Our context exhibits a truly intereſting and an affecting ſcene. Let us accompany, in our ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, this holy man, on his journey through various parts of Aſia, diſpenſing the glad tidings of ſalvation by a Redeemer; and ſaluting the ſeveral churches, which he had been inſtrumental in forming in the name and under the authority of his divine Maſter, until he arrived at Epheſus. There behold him in the midſt of his beloved church, whom by the inſtrumentality of his preaching, the grace of God had converted to the chriſtian faith. To whom the felt himſelf attached by every tender and endearing ſentiment. For whom he had been willing to ſpend and be ſpent, that he might bring them to Chriſt. And whom he had now aſſembled, for the purpoſe of bidding a final farewell. And of commending
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:025565_0010_0FCDFDBA85118028"/>
them to God and the word of his grace. See with what confidence he appeals to the conſciences of thoſe who beſt knew him, whether he had not diſcharged with fidelity the duties of his Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. "Ye know (ſaid he) from the firſt day that I came into Aſia, after what manner I have been with you at all ſeaſons, ſerving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears and temptations, which befel me by the lying in wait of the Jews; and how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have ſhewed you, and have taught you publicly, and from houſe to houſe: Teſtifying both to the Jews and alſo to the Greeks, repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Though as a diſciple of the crucified Jeſus, no diſcouragements, however great, were ſufficient to diſſuade the Apoſtle from his determined pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; or even to check his reſolution to ſerve the cauſe in which his whole ſould was engaged. Yet as a man, he could not but feel the injuries he had ſuſtained, and the ungrateful returns, which had been made by ſome of his barbarous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling countrymen, to his moſt vigorous exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to promote the real happineſs of his fellow mortals. And therefore, in this laſt public addreſs to his beloved brethren in Chriſt, he could not help adverting to them And by paſt experience taught, he looks forward in expectation of farther trials and afflictions from the malice and hatred of thoſe, who are oppoſed to the intereſt of the Redeemer's kingdom; and the diſcipline of that
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:025565_0011_0FCDFDBBFA54E068"/>
holy religion, whoſe mild and benevolent precepts diſcountenance the angry paſſions of the human heart, and requires that hatred and revenge ſhould give place to the grateful emotions of love, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, mutual forbearance, forgiveneſs and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: Of that religion, which is not armed with vengeance, to deſtory the humble penitent; But is ever ready to drop the tear of condolence over the unhappy; and to guide the unwary ſtep into the paths of peace and truth: Of that religion, which has for its objects, the glory of the Deity, and the honour, and the happineſs of all mankind; Which inſpires each individual of its ſincere vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, with ſuch ardent and diffuſive benevolence, as ſhall draw forth his ſoul to the great Father of all, in this devout addreſs.</p>
               <lg>

               <p>
                  <q>And now (ſaith the Apoſtle) behold, I go bound in ſpirit unto Jeruſalem, not knowing the things that ſhall befal me there. Save that the holy Ghoſt witneſſeth in every city, ſaying, that bonds and afflictions abide me.</q> But while the Apoſtle anticipates the evils and dangers attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant on the diſcharge of his miniſtry, he nobly riſes ſuperior to all his apprehenſions; And fired with an heroic ardor, he ſets danger, and even death, in open deſiance. <q>But none of theſe things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myſelf, ſo that I might finiſh my courſe
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:025565_0012_0FCDFDBF1BEF0040"/>
with joy, and the miniſtry which I have received of the Lord Jeſus, to teſtify the goſpel of the grace of God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>O happy Apoſtle! Who would not wiſh to emulate thy reſolution, who has a clear proſpect of the rewards that will crown fidelity, in the immediate preſence, and under the almighty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of thy God? Above the reach of envy; and where the rage of perſections can never harm thee! Thou haſt fulfilled the miniſtry, which thou didſt receive of thy bleſſed Maſter: Thou haſt faithfully teſtified to a deluded, misjudging world the goſpel of the grace of God. And thou haſt finiſhed thy courſe with joy. For in the near proſpect of death; while on the confines of the eternal world, thou waſt able to look back with ſatisfaction on thy paſt life. And rejoicing in thy proſpects of future glory, thou waſt able to ſay, I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith: Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteouſneſs, which the Lord the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous judge ſhall give me at that day.</p>
               <p>But although the Apoſtle Paul has finiſhed his courſe, and is now at reſt in the abodes of bliſs; yet the cauſe, which he ſo ſucceſsfully plead, is not brought to a final iſſue. Nor will it be, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til all the wandering tribes of Adam's race are brought home to their father's houſe. Until the children of men ſhall be perſuaded to ſeek one
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:025565_0013_0FCDFDC083B94AF8"/>
common intereſt; and be united in one happy family. Until the ferocity of the lion ſhall give place to the Inoffenſiveneſs of the lamb; and <q>the leopard ſhall lie down with the kid. When the envy of Ephraim ſhall depart, and the adverſaries of Judah ſhall be cut off. When Ephraim ſhall not envy Judah, and Judah ſhall not vex Ephraim. When the earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the ſea; and when there ſhall be nothing to hurt or deſtroy in all his holy mountain.</q> An conſummation this, devoutly to be wiſhed.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the King of Zion continues to ſend his Ambaſſadors to the children of men; and the religion of the Redeemer, has this day an advocate in every honeſt heart.</p>
               <p>The faithful miniſters of the goſpel, are the ſucceſſors of St. Paul in the ſerviee of the ſame Maſter. Like him they muſt expect to encounter innumerable difficulties; and like him, they muſt reſolve, relying on divine grace, to ſurmount them all. And, in oppoſition to the paſſions and the prejudices of ungodly men, they muſt determine faithfully to diſcharge the duties of their impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and very difficult ſtation.</p>
               <p>But alas! how few of thoſe who take upon them the ſacred office of the miniſtry, can affirm with the confidence of the Apoſtle, that they have not in any thing been deficient? Miniſters are but men: ſubject to like paſſions with their fellow mortals: and expoſed to all the frailties and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:025565_0014_0FCDFDC218046060"/>
of human nature. Perfection is not attainable by them; nor ought it to be expected from them. It is true, however, that the ſacred office which they ſuſtain, places them in an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated point of view. They are therefore, under peculiar obligations to uſe the utmoſt circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection in their converſation and deportment; and to cauſe their light ſo to ſhine before men, that others, ſeeing their good works, may a glorify their heavenly Father. Thoſe who are conſtituted ſacred guides to a benighted world, ſhould be careful to have thoſe rays of divine wiſdom and knowledge, which have been communicated to them, from the father of lights, diſſuſe their benign influence, on all around them. The miniſtry which they have received of the Lord, ſhould always hold the firſt place in their thoughts; and whatever diſcouragements may avait them, in the execution of their important truſt, they ought never to deſpair. But to teſtify the goſpel of the grace of God in their lives and in their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhould always be their ſingle aim. Although enemies ſhould perſecute, and friends betray them. Though they ſhould be made the ſcorn and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the mad multitude. Though poverty and ruin, deſtruction and death ſhould ſtare them in the face; yet none of theſe things ſhould move them, neither ſhould their lives be dear unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when ſet in competition with their faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But with a firm reliance on divine ſupport; and with unſhaken confidence in him, in whoſe cauſe they are engaged: they ſhould not ſhun to declare
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:025565_0015_0FCDFDC39332CF68"/>
the whole counſel of God, though all the powers of darkneſs ſhould ariſe in oppoſition to it. Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by the pleaſing conſideration, that in thus doing, they may finiſh their courſe with joy; they will riſe above the fear of every diſaſterous event in this life; and look forward to the hour of death in grateful expectation.</p>
               <p>But it muſt be confeſſed, that the work of a goſpel miniſter, is difficult and arduous, as well as infinitely important. Our adorable Saviour, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing redeemed our fallen race, from the ruins of apoſtacy, by his own ſufferings and death; not only exhibited in his own character, that temper and conduct, which his diſciples ſhould imitate: but eſtabliſhed his church under ſpecial ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; and publiſhed that ſyſtem of faith and morals, through which he would have the child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren of men qualified for the heavenly world. And that mankind might be inſtructed in the knowledge of the divine will; and be perſuaded to embrace him, as the only mediator, through whom they may become reconciled to their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended Maker, receive the pardon of all their ſins, and obtain the final and everlaſting ſalvation of their ſouls: he was graciouſly pleaſed to ordain and appoint a ſucceſſion of goſpel teachers; who ſhould bear rule in his church; adminiſter the ordinances of his goſpel; impreſs the ſeals of his covenant; ſolemnly warn and exhort in his name; preach him, in his perſon, character and offices; and declare the whole counſel of God, to the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:025565_0016_0FCDFDC4EBA34F78"/>
conviction and converſion of ſinners, and to the edification, comfort and eſtabliſhment of the ſaints. It is therefore the indiſpenſible duty of a goſpel miniſter to watch, that he may be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in ſaving ſouls. Great will be his reward, if he is faithful in the diſcharge of his duty; and ſolemn will be the account, which he muſt give to his divine Maſter if he is not. While expoſed to the wicked and malicious diſpoſitions of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, he has to conflict with many temptations to forſake Chriſt, and to abandon his cauſe: but they are all confined to the preſent term of his exiſtence: while he has many great and precious promiſes, to encourage him to perſevere in his attachment to the truth, and the intereſts of his Redeemer, which ſhall have their full accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the eternal world.</p>
               <p>Although the word faithfully preached, will prove the ſavor of life unto life, unto all them who hear and obey it; and a favor of death unto death, to thoſe who diſregard it: yet the doctrines of grace and ſalvation by Chriſt; which it is the indiſpenſible duty of a goſpel miniſter to preach; are ſo extremely ungrateful to a great part of mankind; that the preacher is too often made the object of their unrighteous reſentment.</p>
               <p>The moſt examplary life, and unblemiſhed cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, are not always ſecure from the ſhafts of malice and detraction. With the bittereſt invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy the hardened Jews perſecuted the holy Lamb of God; and abuſed him with every term
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:025565_0017_0FCDFDC787DA6040"/>
of reproach, with which their ingenuity could furniſh them. And when (while they inhumanly ſought his life) our Lord ſaid unto them, many good works have I ſhewed you from my Father, for which of theſe works do ye ſtone me? They made him this unfeeling reply. For a good work we ſtone thee not, but for blaſphemy, and becauſe that thou being a man, makeſt thyſelf God. Implying that he was an infamous impoſtor, endeavouring to practiſe upon the credulity of the multitude. And if theſe things were done in a green tree, what can we expect in a dry? If men have called the maſter of the houſe Beelzebub, how much more will they call thoſe of his houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold? If he, who is the brightneſs of the Father's glory, and the expreſs image of his perſon, could not paſs through this cenſorious world, without meeting the bittereſt reproaches of thoſe whom he died to ſave, his frail and imperfect diſciples cannot reaſonably expect any thing better.</p>
               <p>The moſt faithful ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt that ever exiſted, falls infinitely ſhort of his bleſſed Maſter. Even the moſt vigilant and circumſpect of thoſe who ſuſtain the ſacred office of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel miniſtry have not only abundant occaſion to humble themſelves before God, on account of their numberleſs imperfections; but they likewiſe frequently ſtand in need of the candor and charity of their fellow men—Of thoſe to whom it is their duty to come, in the name of the Lord, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring his hatred of all unrighteouſneſs. For who can ſay, I have made my heart clean; I am free
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:025565_0018_0FCDFDC945E6ECE0"/>
from tranſgreſſion? Could that divine and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly principle which ſuffereth long and is kind, which vaunteth not itſelf, and rejoiceth not in iniquity; could that cardinal virtue, which is the baſis of all true religion, maintain the place it merits in the hearts of men, they would be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſs only to thoſe errors and imperfections which they find in themſelves. But unhappily for the peace, the harmony and ſecurity of thoſe who ſhould be diſtinguiſhed for the exerciſe of all the chriſtain virtues, they are generally the moſt quickſighted in diſcerning, and the moſt ſevere in cenſuring the faults of others, who need the thickeſt veil to conceal their own.</p>
               <p>But ſo long as the mild and gentle ſpirit of chriſtianity ſhall warm the hearts of the wiſe and good; ſo long, ſhall the humble and ſincere, though imperfect ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt, find a place in their eſteem. Wherever he goes, their beſt wiſhes will attend him; and their devout and ſervent prayers will be, that God may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and bleſs him.</p>
               <p>Virtuous friendſhip is an exalted paſſion. It is the key that opens to all the ſocial affections. It is the ſecret and delicate, though firm and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable ligament that unites congenial ſouls; and conſtitutes the tendereſt attachments that nature knows. It ſeeketh not its own aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizement, but the happineſs of others. It ſets no bounds to its kind and beneficent offices. It begins in virtuous ſouls upon earth, and will be conſummated in heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="unknown:025565_0019_0FCDFDCA35154778"/>
The full force of this divine paſſion the Apoſtle Paul felt for his beloved Church at Epheſus; and in their breaſts it met a generous return. It was this that cemented their mutual affections, and rendered the thoughts of their ſeparation ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely painful.</p>
               <p>But perfect happineſs has not place below the ſkies. Even the joys of virtuous friendſhip are embittered, by the ſad recollection, that the objects of our fondeſt affections muſt ſoon be parted from us.</p>
               <p>Behold, the ſhip is already launched; the breeze ariſes, and the canvaſs ſwells; the moment, the affecting moment, is arrived, when Paul muſt take his laſt farewell of his Epheſian friends. His ſoul, which had maintained its firmneſs through all his ſufferings, and nobly roſe ſuperior to all the dangers with which he was threatened, is now ſubdued by love. I ſee his virtuous conflict, with all the tender paſſions; while I hear him ſay, Now behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, ſhall ſee my face no more.</p>
               <p>And while I ſpeak of his attachment to his beloved Church, methinks I feel my heart glow, with the ſame exalted paſſion for thoſe, of whom I ſhall, this day, publicly take my leave. But, as on parting with his friends, Paul recommended them to God, and the word of his grace: So, after his example, and by your indulgence, I wiſh to take my leave of you, my friends, this afternoon.—</p>

               <head>PART II.</head>
               <p>AS the offices and duties of an evangelical teacher are ſolemn and ſacred, ſo the connexion that ſubſiſts between him and the church and people to whom he has ſtatedly adminiſtered the ordinances, and diſpenſed the doctrines of the goſpel, is tender, intereſting and important. They are equally intereſted in all religious truths; they are accountable to the ſame Lord, for their fidelity to each other; for their fidelity to Chriſt, and to the intereſts of his kingdom.</p>
               <p>The day is not far diſtant, when every ſervant of the Lord Jeſus muſt give an account of his ſtewardſhip; and when all thoſe who have been favored with the means of grace muſt appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the tribunal of Jehovah, and ſhew how they have improved under them. Then if he, to whom has been intruſted the miniſtry of the goſpel of the grace of God, ſhall be found to have been faithful to his ſacred, truſt, and to the all-important cauſe in which he has been employed: If it ſhall then appear, that he has not ſhunned to declare the whole counſel of God; and that he is pure from the blood of all; he ſhall then be owned; approved and honoured by his divine Maſter, who is his final judge. And an unfading crown of glory in the heavens ſhall reward him for all
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:025565_0021_0FCDFDD184C50220"/>
his ſervices and his ſufferings upon earth. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, while in this ſtate of trial and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, he may be (as his maſter was before him) deſpiſed and rejected of men, and regarded by ſhort-ſighted mortals, as one who is ſtricken, ſmitten of God and afflicted; and perſecuted by their relentleſs rage even unto ſtrange cities.</p>
               <p>Happy is that miniſter of Chriſt, whoſe life has uniformly correſponded with the goſpel he has preached. And happy is that people who have realized the worth of ſuch a faithful ſervant of their aſcended Lord, and obeyed the precepts of the goſpel which he has inculcated. They may look on death without one diſtreſſing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion. And with unſpeakable ſatisfaction, they can anticipate that ſolemn moment, when they ſhall again unite at the impartial bar of their righteous Judges; receive his applaudit, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company each other to thoſe bleſſed abodes where all virtuous friends ſhall meet, and part no more through the unmeaſurable ages of an endleſs eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Such a miniſter was the apoſtle Paul, and ſuch were thoſe who compoſed his church at Epheſus. And therefore, while he bids them a long farewell, expecting never more to ſee them upon earth; he can confidently affirm, that he is pure from the blood of all men. And that he has not ſhunned to declare unto them all the counſel of God. This great Apoſtle is an example to his ſucceſſors in ſufferings and in patience; in word, in charity, in faith and in purity. But
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:025565_0022_0FCDFDD376397C28"/>
there are but few however of his ſucceſſors, who do not fall ſhort of the example he has ſet them. The height of their pretentions in general is, that they have endeavoured to walk worthy of their high and holy vocation; and that they have not willingly ſhunned to declare all the counſel of God.</p>
               <p>This, my friends, is the moſt that I pretend to. Many are the imperfections of my life, and great is my need of pardoning mercy, and renovating grace. With a ſubmiſſive temper of mind, I would notice the diſpenſations of divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence towards me. And I would aſcribe righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to my Maker, under all his dealings with me. I would cultivate and cheriſh the temper of the meek and lowly Jeſus, in which he ſaid to the Roman governor, "Thou couldeſt have no power at all againſt me, expect it were given thee from above." And of holy David, when under his ſevereſt trials and afflications, "Let Shimei curſe, for the Lord hath bidden him." But my friends, I can with confidence appeal to the God who knows my heart, to witneſs the ſincerity of my deſires, to ſerve him with fidelity, in the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of his Son. And that I have not, knowingly, kept back any thing that was profitable unto you, through the fear of man; or under the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of incurring the diſpleaſure of thoſe, who do not conceive of ſome of the doctrines of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in the ſame light with myſelf. It has been my uniform endeavour, to urge upon you all, the neceſſity and the infinite importance of attending
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:025565_0023_0FCDFDD4E7C64428"/>
on the means of grace, and the inſtitutions of our holy religion; to hold up to your view the moral ſentiments and the practical duties of chriſtianity; and to teſtify to all, whatever their ſpeculative opinions might be, repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And if I cannot ſay with the confidence of the Apoſtle in the text, that I have not ſhunned to declare unto you all the counſel of God; yet I can ſay, with as much ſincerity as he felt, that I have not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignedly neglected it. And if the moſt ardent wiſhes for your preſent peace and proſperity, and for your future and eternal glory and happineſs, will juſtify the aſſertion, I can ſay, that I am pure from the blood of all men. I have wiſhed and prayed for your good, but I have never had in my heart to injure any individual of you. And though my ſervices and my ſufferings, my prayers and my tears, may not be felt or acknowledged by my fellow men; yet I have the heart-ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating ſatisfaction of reflecting with holy Job, "that my witneſs is in heaven, and that my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord is on high." With him, "I know that my Redeemer lives."</p>
               <p>Many, my friends, have been the evils with which I have been called to encounter, from my firſt entering upon the work of the goſpel in this place. The envenomed tongue of the moſt mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſlander has been employed to wound my fame; my moſt ſtudious exertions to aſſert and maintain, what I have received as the truths
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:025565_0024_0FCDFDD6229EB778"/>
of the goſpel, have been deſpiſed by ſome as the warm effuſions of an heretical brain. And my firm adherence to an incumbent duty has been conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into obſtinacy, and imputed to the want of an obliging diſpoſtion. Sincere in my conceſſions, and ſanguine in my expectations, I have been betrayed in my confidence; and ſeen all my ſaireſt proſpects in a moment blaſted. And now, ſhall I ſay that none of theſe things move me? and that neither do I count my life dear unto myſelf? Yes, I will truly ſay it, if I may but finiſh my courſe with joy, and the miniſtry which I have received of the Lord Jeſus, to teſtify the goſpel of the grace of God.</p>
               <p>My brethren, I have not unfriendly paſſion to gratify. I have no diſpoſition to revenge upon the moſt unfeeling of my enemies. I will not even ſay of them (as St. Paul ſaid of Alexander the copper-ſmith) they have done me much evil, the Lord reward them according to their works. No, but I will leave them with their God, and pray for the ſalvation of their ſouls. I have no doubt, but that many who have taken a part in afflicting me, have been led to it through miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>information, or the want of proper attention, or by the influence of bad adviſers; which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I can freely overlook, and heartily forgive.</p>
               <p>This world, my friends, is not our home, and when compared with the glories that are to be revealed, its intereſts are not worth contending for. We are deſigned for another ſtate of exiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:025565_0025_0FCDFDD925790098"/>
this life is but the dawn of that eternal day, to which we are as yet ſcarcely awakened. We enter upon this ſtage of mortality in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous order; we here form various con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions which muſt be all of ſhort duration. Diſaſter or death ſoon diſunites us for a time; but we part, ſoon to meet again.</p>
               <p>You and I, my friends, have been connected under the moſt intereſting and important of all relations; it is now diſſolved. Perhaps this is the laſt time we ſhall ever behold each others faces upon earth. This is undoubtedly the laſt time you will ever hear my voice from this ſacred deſk. But, my friends, we ſoon ſhall meet again; at the moment of our ſeparation, we are all haſtening, as faſt as the wings of time can carry us, to unite with a whole aſſembled world, before the impartial bar of the dread Sovereign of the univerſe; whoſe piercing eye now ſearches the human heart, and tries the reins of the children of men. Yes, my friends, we muſt ſhortly, very ſhortly, all appear before our Judge; where our late relation to each other will be brought into view. Where I muſt give an account of the errors of my life, and for every neglect of my duty as a miniſter of the goſpel of the grace of God; and where you, my friends, muſt likewiſe give an account of the temper and diſpoſition with which you have attended on my miniſtry, and the manner in which you have profited under it; and where you muſt account not only for
<pb n="0026" facs="unknown:025565_0026_0FCDFDDAAEB6A610"/>
your conduct towards me as a chriſtian brother and a chriſtian miniſter; but likewiſe for the motives which actuated you thereto. With pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hope and grateful expectation, I look forward to the events of that all-important period; and may God of his infinite compaſſion and grace diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and enable each of us ſo to rectify whatever has been amiſs, either in our temper or conduct, as that the approaching day of final retribution may be as happy as it muſt be ſolemn to us all.</p>
               <p>But though this life is not the time to revenge injuries, but to forgive, and if poſſible, to forget them; yet ſurely it is a fit ſeason for the grateful acknowledgement of benefits and kindneſſes. And therefore, it is with pleaſure, that I take this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity publicly to acknowledge the many and repeated expreſſions of friendſhip and eſteem which I have received from many of the people of this pariſh, from my firſt coming among them to the preſent day. Be aſſured, my friends, not the ſmalleſt token of your kindneſs has been paſſed unnoticed. I have a lively remembrance of all your favors, it will accompany me wherever I go, and through whatever ſcenes I may be called to paſs. Although I may be loſt to you, yet your friendſhip is not loſt upon me, it has made ſuch a deep impreſſion upon my heart, as can never be craſed, until it is aſleep in the cold and ſilent grave. Accept my ſincere thanks and moſt devour good wiſhes; they are the only returns that are now in my power to make to all your benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: but they are a grateful offering, which a generous mind will not deſpiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="0027" facs="unknown:025565_0027_0FCDFDDC6D4128C8"/>
It now remains, that I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are ſanctified.</p>
               <p>You have now a dangerous path to tread, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſpiritual guide to go before you in the exerciſes of public devotion. The Apoſtle, in our context, was extremely anxious for the peace and ſecurity of his beloved ſtock at Epheſus, when he could no longer be with them. For I know this, ſaid he, that after my departing, ſhall griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wolves enter in among you, not ſparing the flock. Alſo of yourſelves ſhall men ariſe, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perverſe things, to draw away diſciples after them. And, have I no longer any intereſt in you, my friends? God is my witneſs, who daily hears my prayers for his bleſſings on you, that I have. Ye are now my brethren, who ſo lately were the people of my charge. And as we are now about to take our leave of each other, to purſue (as I humbly hope) our journey to our heavenly Father's houſe; I will offer you the parting cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which Joſeph gave to his brethren, when they left him, to go up from Egypt, to their father in Canaan.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>And he ſaid upto them, ſee that ye fall not out by the way.</q> Let me entreat you to forget all former prejudices, and endeavour to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to one other. Seek a ſpeedy reſettlement of the goſpel among you, with ſincere deſires to profit
<pb n="0028" facs="unknown:025565_0028_0FCDFDE0C4D79FC0"/>
profit by the diſpenſation of its doctrines and its precepts. If you can be united, you may yet be a happy and a reſpectable ſociety. But if malice and ill-will, if prejudice, hatred and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and every unfriendly and deſtructive paſſion are not ſpeedily ſuppreſſed, your ruin is unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Studiouſly avoid therefore, all movements towards confuſion and diſorder. Study the things that make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another. Seek to have the word of God diſpenſed to you in its purity, and cheriſh the faith that was once delivered to the ſaints. You have more preſſing motives to peace and union among yourſelves, and more important conſiderations to prevent your falling out with each other, on your journey through the wilderneſs of this life, than the brethren of Joseph had, while they journeyed towards their native land.</p>
               <p>You are all the offspring of God; the parent of the univerſe is the former of your bodies, and the father of your ſpirits; he regards you as his children; he knows your infirmities, and is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly attentive to your wants: Your exiſtence originated in his love, and you are all equally dependent on his bounty. He views no indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual with a partial fondneſs, further than amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of temper, and propriety of conduct, may juſtly merit the diſtinction; but as a kind and indulgent parent, he delights in the peace and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of all his children. The relation, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in which you all ſtand to God ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind

you of the relation you bear to each other, and should teach you to cheriſh that fraternal affection, which ſhould be mutually exerciſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong brethren. And you are expreſsly exhorted to the cultivation of brotherly love by the great Redeemer of the world; who, that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile the children of men to one another, and ſo prepare them for a reconciliation with offended Heaven, became an inſtructor and an example in this important duty; and has left it as the indiſputable evidence by which we are to prove that we are his diſciples.—"For as I have loved you," ſaid Chriſt, "ſo ought ye alſo to love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther." And <q>by this ſhall all men know that ye are my diſciples, if ye have love one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</q> What a powerful motive ſhould this be with you, to ſuppreſs every unchriſtian and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendly thought, and on every occaſion to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt mutual love, kindneſs and compaſſion.</p>
               <p>In innumerable inſtances we have all tranſgreſſed against the righteous laws of God; and the need we all ſtand in of his forgiveneſs ſhould teach us the reaſonableneſs and neceſſity of our being will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to forgive thoſe who may have offended us. And in our addreſſes at the throne of grace, we are expreſsly taught by our bleſſed Lord, to pray for the forgiveneſ of our own ſins, on condition of our being freely diſpoſed to forgive thoſe who ſin againſt us; and are aſſured, that <q>if we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give not men their treſpaſſes, neither will our heavenly father forgive us our treſpaſſes.</q>

While on earth, you are all, my friends, in a ſtate of pilgrimage; profeſſedly journeying to the ſame eternal home; and whatever different ſubordinate views you may each of you have here, yet your principal and ultimate view is the ſame. The heavenly Jeruſalem is the place at which you all hope to arrive. And Heaven, let it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, admits none of thoſe jarring diſcords, ſeuds and confuſions which diſturb the peace and happineſs of the preſent ſtate; that is the bleſſed abode of peace, of joy, and everlaſting love. No rankled temper, no ruffled paſſions, no diſconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant or unfriendly thought, ſhall ever be found among the ſaints in light: But felicity and truth, amity and love, complacency and peace, delight and concord, will be the invariable temper of all the ſons of glory. And if the temper or conduct of any of your fellow travellers occaſion you any preſent vexation or concern, let this thought afford you comfort and relief, that if ever you meet them in heaven, you will find them ſo entirely reformed as that you ſhall cheerfully embrace them for your moſt cordial friends.</p>

                  <q>There are two things which have a direct and a moſt unhappy tendency to foment an unfriendly ſpirit, and prompt men to a viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the great laws of chriſtian charity, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Unruly paſſions and unreaſonable prejudices. When theſe are indulged ſo far as to break through the reſtraints of conſcience and of honour, it is no wonder if we ſee perſons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the government of them frequently find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

fault with the beſt men, and the beſt things. From hence aroſe that implacable hatred which the Jews ſhewed to our Saviour's perſon, and the violent oppoſition they made to his doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, and which the bigotted and profane part of mankind have in ſome degree ſhewn to his true cauſe and faithful ſervants ever ſince And even good men, ſo far as they are under the unhappy influence of them, always diſcover either a very unlovely temper, or very erroneous principles. Firſt then, if you would preſerve and cultivate a ſpirit of unanimity and peace, you muſt guard againſt intemperate paſſions, and eſpecially againſt thoſe, which are moſt apt to predominate. Paſſion is always a blind and a furious guide; and if it is not ſanctified by grace, or ſubdued by reaſon, proves exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly detrimental to a man's peace and intereſt. It was deſigned to be the ſervant of reaſon, and to follow after it; but if inſtead of being obedient to it, it once gains the aſcendency over it, it hurries a man into the wildeſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes, and renders him either a very contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible or a very dangerous enemy; and like an unbridled, headſtrong horſe, overleaps all the bounds of religion, reaſon, humanity, common ſenſe, or common decency, that ſtands in the way of its mad career.</q>

                  <q>And unreaſonable prejudice is equally detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to the intereſts of peace and brotherly love. Prejudice is a precipitant determination
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:025565_0032_0FCDFDE965FF2088"/>
of the mind for, or againſt any particular object, previous to a proper enquiry into its nature; or, as the word itſelf imports, to judge before we examine; that is to judge by the paſſions rather than the underſtanding. Hence we ſee that perſons of the warmeſt paſſions are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the moſt ſubjects to this foible. And opinions thus raſhly taken up, without evidence, are called prejudices. And they are moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the effect of ignorance and vanity united; and moſt incident to perſons of quick and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident ſpirits, who have not patience to examine the premiſes, before they draw the concluſion. And then, through a weak miſtaken notion, that it is diſhonorable to be convinced of an error, reſolve for the credit of their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as they ſuppoſe (but really at the expenſe of it) to retain and defend their error againſt all evidence of ſenſe, fact and reaſon. But this not only expoſes a man's underſtanding, but renders him a very unſociable creature; an uncharitable chriſtian, if a chriſtian; or an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate infidel if not. And where paſſion and prejudice both unite their influence, they make a man unſufferably arrogant and aſſuming. If therefore you would cultivate peace and love, you muſt guard equally againſt unruly paſſions and unreaſonable prejudices; and the more carefully, becauſe they are both apt to ſteal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the mind unobſerved.</q> Reſolve freely and candidly to examine, before you judge of any thing that is propoſed to your faith; and let
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:025565_0033_0FCDFDEADAE12E08"/>
reaſon and the ſacred ſcriptures furniſh the rules by which you make up your judgment. But always remember to maintain the truth in love, becauſe the wrath of man worketh not the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God.</p>
