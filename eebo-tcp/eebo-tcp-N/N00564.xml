            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.
      </p>
         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="unknown:000693_0004_0FA9A133321DC1F8"/>
so,</hi> a Deceived Heart hath turned them aside, that they cannot say, is there not a Lie in our Right hand? <hi>and were it not that there are so many, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring of such ignorance, as to think that holding our peace, were a yielding up the cause, it were pity, at this time of day, to take so much notice of their Scriblings, as to waste Paper in replying upon them. But since there is a kind of a necessity for it, lest the</hi> sacred Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles <hi>should seem to some, not sufficiently defended without it, it may not be thought unadvisable to comply with the second part of the Wisemans</hi> Antithesis, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26. 5. <hi>and, though no Truth is to be foregone, yet when the Foundations are stricken at, and those Articles on which our hopes for Eternal Life are built, be Undermined, it is time to arm in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of them.</hi>

            <p>I <hi>Cannot but admire the Instability of many who are so easily, and soon drawn to Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and Espouse that perswasion and way of those called Quakers, and that because of an outward and seeming</hi> Sanctity, <hi>that is to be found, and to be discerned among many of them consisting only in Negatives, making up a Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risaical Righteousness, made of those things that are not peculiar to</hi> Quakers <hi>only, of not</hi> Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, Drinking, <hi>and</hi> Ranting: <hi>but if they would but cautiously Look, before they Leap, they would find the principles of many of the Reformed</hi> Churches <hi>as much against all those, and many more evils, as theirs can be, and thousands of Professors exceed them in a shining Holiness, and Christian Universal Piety; and though others walk disorderly, and not answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Gospel of our Lord Jesus, is not to be imputed to our Profession, Principles or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Worshipping God; otherwise all Religion would soon be rejected, and</hi> Quakerism <hi>it self would be soon deserted. The most of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is composed of Negative, for many of
<pb facs="unknown:000693_0007_0FA9A136337D36A0"/>
them are as void of the positive part of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as worshipping God in the publick, private and secret Duties of Religion, as many moral Heathens, who if they had but Learned their usual tone, and grown sullen and unmannerly, might pass for</hi> Quakers <hi>all over the world. If we take a view of their principles in believing every one of them severally by themselves, and the Books of particular Writers, they are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repugnant to truth, contrary to Gods Word, and the publick received Doctrine of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Christ for many Centurys past; but also dangerous and damnable. They cannot be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as a Church, having not unanimously<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and fairly, or faithfully published all their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and principles, which is the cause many Espouse they know not what; they have not in any of their Writings declared their Church Order, Constitution, Government nor Discipline. They have no orderly way of Admission for Teaching Officers, but as many men, &amp; women, as say, the Spirit of the Lord is upon them, must be received, though they can give no convincing proof, but to those already Deluded to their way from which they want the pure and powerful Preaching of the Gospel, and all Administration of Sacraments, which they slightly ridicule, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than own; they hold or maintain a common Christ in all, even in the Reprobate, in whom the Spirit of God says, Christ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <hi>Reader, I offer here some Sheets to thy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial perusal, which was occasioned by a Paper writ by</hi> George Keith, <hi>and delivered by his own hands into the hands of Mr.</hi> George Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field <hi>at</hi> Rehoboth <hi>in</hi> Pocamok, <hi>from whence as many as read, may soon conclude, this debate was first set on foot by themselves, and by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting, it gave occasion for Laying open both their Principles, and their practises, more in these corners of the World, then they have yet been. In which Answer, I have given Reply to all the Calumnies and Charges in that Paper a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst my Catechism, which I am obliged to Justifie and Defend.

<pb facs="unknown:000693_0009_0FA9A137AE5CE580"/>
And concerning this Subject, I Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend</hi> Keith <hi>and all of them to</hi> Candree <hi>and</hi> Palmer, <hi>Mr.</hi> John Brown, <hi>sometime of</hi> Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>and Mr.</hi> Matthew Crawford; <hi>and whoever answers them, shall answer me; If any should Censure me for my tediousness in answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; I had finished it a year ago, but by reason of my tedious Affliction, not Transcribed until now.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I had a visit from <hi>Keith</hi> at my house in <hi>Virginia,</hi> which though promised and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by his Harbinger to be on <hi>Fryday,</hi> was not performed until <hi>Saturday,</hi> in the Afternoon, &amp; by the uncertainty of their coming, was prevented of having any of my Friends present, though some few drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in occasionally, at which time we had several Charges and Questions, concerning several things, which were too tedious to Rehearse here: but I wish they had been Recorded then, to prevent many misrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations, that were spread abroad by that Party. And though there was no real De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate; &amp; he oft told me, he came not to Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with me, yet Son after they boasted of a Victory; which if they find after a diligent perusal, &amp; impartial consideration of these Sheets, let them improve and post it if they will. <hi>Yet after some Discourse, be impudently Charged me as a False Teacher, and
<pb facs="unknown:000693_0010_0FA9A13870ED3CF0"/>
challenged me to a</hi> Publick <hi>Dispute, before the Multitude, which I scorned with a sharp retor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and that for these reasons:</hi> 1. <hi>Their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were unknown, because never</hi> unanimous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>agreed upon, nor</hi> fairly <hi>Published to the World, therefore not to be Disputed within words.</hi> 2. <hi>We</hi> should <hi>Dispute before an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and illeterate</hi> Multitude <hi>who</hi> should <hi>be most incompetent Judges.</hi> 3. <hi>Because he would run into Learning, and</hi> I <hi>must follow, and so what</hi> should <hi>be</hi> Delivered, <hi>should not tend to their Edification, but fall to the ground, and be Lost. But afterwards I gave him a</hi> Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge <hi>to oppose my Catechism, or</hi> Principles <hi>in Writing, and he</hi> should <hi>have an Answer to every</hi> Particular; <hi>though</hi> Keith <hi>gave not the</hi> least <hi>intimation of this Paper left behind him, though he dropt an Expression, which I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood not then, that he</hi> would <hi>Write no more then he had done; this I took for</hi> Declining <hi>my Challenge: Now I Leave it to</hi> all <hi>to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine whose</hi> Challenges <hi>or Overture was fairest, for</hi> 1. <hi>What either of us</hi> should Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, should <hi>be on Record, and we could not fly from it.</hi> 2.

               <hi>Several mixed Quoeries, to be resolved by</hi> Quakers <hi>in this juncture, for the Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of themselves and satisfaction of all.</hi> July 26<hi>th.</hi> 1692.</head>
            <p>(<hi>Question</hi> I.) WHat is the Reason <hi>Quakers</hi> are so far Metamorphosed, or Changed, both in Judgment, and Practice at this Day, from what they once were, at their first rise in <hi>Europe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. What is the Reason <hi>Quakers</hi> that look upon themselves, as the only pure Church in the World, has never yet adventured to Publish a form of sound words according to the Apostles language, containing a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of their faith, and principles, unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously agreed upon among themselves, as all other churches in the world have done.</p>
            <p n="3">III Seeing they own themselves divinely inspired from an immediate call, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick mission, why they have not adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to publish interpretations of Scripture seeing they condemn &amp; so far disapprove all other Commentaries, as far from the mind of God, and full of gross Errors, and mistakes.</p>
            <p n="4">IV Wherefore did they write, and Bark so much against all witnessing to truth,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:000693_0013_0FA9A13CF2A0AD98"/>
conviction of falshood, in Judicatures, by an oath, as sinful, and unlawful under the Gospel, and now in <hi>Pensilvania,</hi> and <hi>Mary-Land,</hi> seem only to quarrel, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and way of Swearing on the Book ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>English</hi> Form, and are willing to Swear now in Judicatures, with lifted up hands, which many look upon to be more solemn than the former?</p>
            <p n="5">V. Whether it be the same individual nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical Body for substance which falleth that shall rise again at the Resurrection, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of Changes, in Respect of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity?</p>
            <p n="6">VI. If there be a sufficient and saving light in all men to instruct, direct, and to teach them; what necessity is there for mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying so many Teachers, both of Men and Women, among <hi>Quakers?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">VII. Why <hi>Quakers</hi> are so hot, and Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for K. <hi>James,</hi> a Popish and Abdica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Prince, and was never so for any other Protestant King, tho' King <hi>WILLIAM</hi> and Queen <hi>MARY</hi> has been kinder than any other, by giving a Liberty established by Law?</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. Whether the same individual Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, that was cloathed with Flesh, suffered, and died at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> is the same that rose again, and is ascended to Glory, and the

same they hold substantially in all men and women?</p>
            <p n="9">IX How Christ, the Spirit of God, saving Grace, an d<hi>L</hi>ight can be in those, who have not the least knowledg of him as Mediator and Intercessour between God and sinners.</p>

            <p n="11">XI Why they use not means for edifying &amp; reforming those of their families, by calling <hi>them</hi> together, reading Scripture daily to <hi>them</hi> &amp; praying with &amp; for them, as other <hi>Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians</hi> in all Churches, and Ages have done, and is approved in the Word of God.</p>
            <p n="12">XII Wherefore <hi>Quakers</hi> have not adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>to</hi> publish their doctrines publickly <hi>taught,</hi> which they say is immediate from the spirit of God, as most other Churches have done frequently.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII Seeing they decry the civil salutations of the Kingdom, &amp; people, among <hi>whom they</hi> live, what warrant can they produce for their singular, ugly, &amp; bad natured way of salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, their Males &amp; Females taking one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother by the hands or wrists, continuing a considerable space, wringing them hard, &amp;

            <head>A True Copy of George Keith's Paper, Delivered to Mr. George Layfield, At POCAMOK in MARY-LAND.</head>
            <p>K<hi>IND</hi> Friend <hi>George Lay-field,</hi> my Dear Love in the Lord Jesus Christ Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteth thee, with Earnest Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Prayer to God for thee, that God, who hath begun his good work in thee, may perfect it, until the Day of Christ, and that the Precious Seed, that God hath Sown in thy Heart may grow not only to be the greatest of Herbs, but a great Tree, bringing forth Fruit, to Gods Everlasting Praise, and to thy Souls Everlasting Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Happiness.</p>
            <p>As concerning the Catechism, Published by <hi>F. M.</hi> I have diligently read, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered it, and tho' it holdeth forth diverse true things, yet it hath a great mixture of Error, and many false, and unsound hurtful things it doth contain; which my present shortness of time in these Parts, doth not permit me to mention in most particulars; and as the same Catechism aboundeth
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000693_0017_0FA9A13F39D436E8"/>
with many Errors; so it falleth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding short, in not mentioning in the least, many necessary Truths, and Doctrines, which are of great necessity, to be taught unto people, as belonging to the first Principles of Christian Religion, which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together omitteth; nor doth he in the least declare that he receiveth any one of these things, delivered by him, in his said Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism, from any inward opening or disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of Gods Spirit in his Heart: Nor doth he mention, any one thing of his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; of the work of God in his heart, but as his Title Page sheweth, his whole Work is but a Collection from others; he mentions nothing in all his Catechism, that people are to be turned or directed to God, or Christ, or the Spirit of God in them, he telleth not People, that it is God or Christ, or the Spirit of God convinceth them, and reproveth them for sins of all sorts, as Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Pride, Envy, Coveteousness, Unbelief, he doth not instruct People, how they are to find God and Christ in their Hearts, and how they are to wait in silence of mind, and thoughts, to hear God, and Christ speak inwardly unto them in their Hearts, in the silence of all Flesh; and how they are to have God and Christ, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit to <hi>dwell</hi> and <hi>walk</hi> in them, and to <hi>teach</hi> them over and beyond all outward
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000693_0018_0FA9A13FEDEADA30"/>
               <hi>teaching;</hi> he mentions very little of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit at all, and what he mentions of it is, very <hi>Obscurely,</hi> so that without breach of <hi>Charity,</hi> I can freely say, he is a great Stranger to the <hi>inward Dealings and Workings of Gods Holy Spirit in the Hearts of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:</hi> and whereas he mentions, his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion over the Tender Souls, in an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican Desart,</hi> ready to perish for want of a <hi>Vision,</hi> in his <hi>Epistle to the Reader;</hi> his <hi>Catechism</hi> can nothing help them in that respect; for not one word in all his <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism,</hi> directeth People were to find the true <hi>Vision</hi> of God in any measure; but on the contrary, according to <hi>his,</hi> and <hi>his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therens</hi> False Faith, all true Divine <hi>Vision,</hi> and <hi>Revelation,</hi> and all Divine <hi>Inspiration,</hi> in ceased since the <hi>Apostles</hi> Days, both among <hi>Teachers</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> and God hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted His Counsel wholly to Writing, the former ways of Gods revealing himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ceased; and they say further, there is no inward voice, or word of God in people, but the <hi>Scripture</hi> is the only Word, and only Rule, all which is most false, and hurtful <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and doth more hurt where it is received, then all his <hi>Catechism</hi> can do good. And all the People in <hi>Virginia</hi> both <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> whom he seemeth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon for their Ignorance, have the Holy Scriptures without, and the Holy
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000693_0019_0FA9A140ACBE0A60"/>
teachings; and illuminations of God and Christ within, to teach them what is needful to their Salvation, if they will hearken there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, far better then this <hi>Catehism</hi> of <hi>F M.</hi> which is defective, and wanting of many Principal and necessary doctrines, belonging to the Christian Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the first Page of his</hi> Catechism, <hi>He saith, God made the World out of Nothing;</hi> but this is no Scripture Language and indeed in very many of his Answers, he holdeth not to Scripture Language, but useth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented words of Mans Wisdom, not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, but contrary unto the Holy Scriptures. May it not suffice to say, <hi>God Created all things by Jesus Christ;</hi> as the Scriptures de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, without adding to the Word of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page Third.</hi> He mentions no other <hi>Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> but the <hi>Scriptures</hi> given to men, to serve and Glorify God; And thus according to him; all these great Nations who have not the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> are wholly left without all Teaching of God to Serve and Glorify him, in the least measure, but this is expresly contrary to <hi>Scripture,</hi> which say concerning the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who had not the Law outwardly delivered in Scripture, that they did show the work of the Law in their hearts, and what was to be known of God, was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest in them; for God had shown it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000693_0020_0FA9A141701F32D8"/>
to them, and when they knew God, they Glorified him not as God and Christ the Light of the World, hath enlightned every man that cometh into the World; and teacheth every man in some measure to serve God, which is to obey him, otherwise they could not have sin; if there were nothing in the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to require obedience or ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of them unto God.</p>
            <p>It had been much better in this <hi>Authour</hi> to have instructed People, that they had some other helps, and means of knowledge with the Scriptures, and these some outward, and some inward, although it is to be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that the Scriptures are the best of all <hi>Books</hi> outward, yet there is the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Gods Creation,</hi> and the <hi>Book</hi> of His <hi>Providence over all his Creatures;</hi> that are no small helps and means, in their place being duely used and together with God, Christ, and the Spirit, are inwardly present to teach all People, in some things to serve God, and as every one is faithful in the little, more is given to them.</p>
            <p>Besides, that the Writer of this <hi>Catechism</hi> should have joined the spirit of God &amp; Christ with the Scriptures, as the <hi>Opener,</hi> &amp; <hi>Interpreter</hi> of them, informing people that the Scriptures are the <hi>Organ</hi> &amp; <hi>Instrument</hi> of Gods Spirit; &amp; that Gods Good, and Holy Spirit, is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Author and cause of all true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000693_0021_0FA9A143170F1768"/>
of God, as the doth inwardly inspire, and enlighten every one; and that there is no true saving knowledge of God, and Christ, without the Spirits Inspiration, and Teaching; and that how much soever peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple read or hear the Scriptures, if they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect or turn away their minds from Gods inward teachings, by his Word, Spirit, and Light within their hearts, they remain Blind, and Dark; and Ignorant of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page Third.</hi> That he saith there are <hi>Three Persons in the God-head;</hi> this is not Scripture Language, to say Three Persons, <hi>The Mystery of the Three,</hi> to wit, the <hi>Father</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>Holy-Ghost,</hi> who are One GOD, is Great, and Glorious, and ought to be Reverently conceived &amp; expressed, in Scripture words, which the Holy-Ghost hath Taught; but not in words of Mans Wisdom.</p>

            <p>And that he saith, <hi>Christ revealeth the Will of God to us, by His Word and Spirit; in Page</hi> 10. He delivereth this matter very barely, and obscurely; for he does not tell people where they may find the Spirit of God; he doth not instruct them, <hi>That the Spirit of God is in them to teach them, and open the Scriptures unto them:</hi> And tho' he delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth diverse things in his <hi>Catechism,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the New Covenant, yet he neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecteth a Principal matter belonging to the same; <abbr>

            <head>A Short Answer, to George Keith's Lybel, Against a CATECHISM Published, by F. M. And left in the Hands of, Mr. George Layfield.</head>
            <p>I AM not a little surprised to recieve from the hands of Mr <hi>George Layfield</hi> a paper containing so many mistakes, false, unjust, and invidous charges against a Catechism Published by <hi>F. M.</hi> and the rather because of his high pretences to an immideate mision, and vain boasting of an extraordinary A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolick call, insulting over all others from unusual high and enthusiastick attainments compleat perfection, and unheard of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences, which the most serious and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are strangers unto, and what they have any experience of most modest in discours<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them and selfe denyed under their greatest enjoyments I shall wave two things First it's being delivered without a subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:000693_0032_0FA9A18DF5F68788"/>
whereby it is to be looked upon as a Libel not to be Answered, nor Regarded. Secondly, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plementing and flattering preamble, they have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Condemned</hi> in others, and withal am glad to Hear they have any Charity for any of a different Opinion from themselves, which coming to hear their Teachers will procure at any time. First, He begins with a general Charge of many <hi>Errors, false</hi> and <hi>unsound things</hi> comprehended in the <hi>Catechism;</hi> And next, He asserts the <hi>Author</hi> to be guilty of many <hi>Omissions</hi> and this from one pretending to Learning, who has diligently read and considered it, as he says, is so insignificant and idle Imputation, which all modest, and ingenuous men, must never disown; and that there are <hi>Omissions,</hi> wilful and designed <hi>Omissions,</hi> I shall never deny, for after it was first Composed, I did <hi>Compendize</hi> and <hi>Abreviate</hi> it ofter than once, to suit it to the Capacities of, such for whom it was prepared, even young ones, to whom, <hi>Quakers</hi> have had little regard hitherto, as to their Instruction in Religious Fundamentals: Neither have I seen any Writings of <hi>Quakers,</hi> even those pretending to give accounts of their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, but justly may be charged with greater <hi>Omissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> then any yet discovered in the <hi>Catechism,</hi> Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by <hi>F. M.</hi> as the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> of <hi>Persons</hi> in the <hi>God head,</hi> the <hi>Ten Commandments,</hi> and the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> the Pattern of all Prayer; and <hi>George Fox</hi> his Received <hi>Catechism,</hi> industriously spread by <hi>Quakers,</hi> not only favours of Humane Learning, and words of mans wisdom, but guilty of many weighty <hi>Omissions,</hi> and fills up a great part with stuff wherein there is no <hi>Religion'</hi> far less can they be called <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> as <hi>Salutations</hi> by <hi>words</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:000693_0033_0FA9A18EB8B15610"/>
and <hi>Gestures, Covering</hi> and <hi>Uncovering</hi> the Head, condemning Preaching in <hi>Steeple Houses</hi> &amp; <hi>Churches.</hi> Yea I appeal to the impartial, and unbiassed Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if the <hi>Catechism</hi> Composed by <hi>F. M.</hi> contains not more of the Principles of Religion, then one containing <hi>Quakers</hi> Principles, Composed by several Hands, as <hi>Crook, Pennington, Burroughs, Parker, Smith,</hi> and several others; now I refer my self to every man, how invidious and unjust it is to Charge a <hi>Catechism</hi> composed by one with <hi>Omissions,</hi> while so many pretenders to immediate Revelations and Inspirations, are guilty of so great <hi>Omissions,</hi> and vain <hi>Repetitions;</hi> and there is not a Book which I have see writ by <hi>George Keith,</hi> but may as justly lie under this Charge, as my <hi>Catechism;</hi> &amp;it were vain Ostentation to disown it. And for my own part, I have ever observed in all the Writings of men, Ignorance, Infirmity, and Imperfection, to magnifie the Excellency of the Scriptures above all Books of mens Composure; but it is no strange thing to find <hi>Quakers</hi> quarrelling our succinct way, of composing our Principles for young ones, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are opposite to so early Edification, which practice is very inconsistent with Scripture Precepts, and Presidents of Training a Child when young, bringing up Children <hi>in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord;</hi> and <hi>Timothy knew the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures from a Child;</hi> and the advantage of an early Instruction is witnessed by the experiences of many Godly in all Ages, where attended with the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of God, and pursued with Exhortation, until they arrive at a riper age: Now I leave all to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider how insignificant and imputation this of <hi>Omission</hi> is.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:000693_0034_0FA9A18F778EABE8"/>
Another general Charge is, that I have not declared from whence I have Received these things, and that I have owned in the Title Page of my <hi>Catechism,</hi> to be but a Collection from others: These are heavy Charges with him, therefore shall answer them particularly. 1. Any that reads his Paper, may understand he is as guilty of that <hi>Omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> as any of his Neighbours, for he has not told from whence he had what is delivered in this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and it was the best policy; for he durst not assert it was from the Spirit of God, because of the falshood and malice it contains, as! shall make appear. 2. If they are the Truths of God, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to Scripture, it is easily determined from whence these Truths are, which were questioned by few, until <hi>G. K.</hi> whose Trade has been to Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Contention, and stir up strife in the Churches of Christ in the World; and whose Arguments are so slender and thred bare, that they scarce deserve an Answer. 3. If I inclined to stuff my Doctrines and Discourse upon all occasions, with enlarged Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of Conversion or a work of Grace, with concomitant and consequent Experiences of the Operations of Gods Holy Spirit, as <hi>Keith</hi> pretends to do, I might amuse my Hearers; but Actions and Conversation are better demonstrations of a work of Grace, then all <hi>Keith's</hi> vain boasting Language, which with his self magnifying Language, can be esteemed nothing else then a Crying up and Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching himself, instead of Christ; for though <hi>Paul</hi> oft declared his Conversion, and gloried in his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, it was, that the Free Grace of God might be exalted, and self abased; which <hi>Quakers</hi> are rarely acquainted with, either in Praying or
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:000693_0035_0FA9A190C89FEE78"/>
Teaching, as many who have heard them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways declare.</p>
            <p>And because <hi>Keith</hi> has shewn himself void of Charity, by shooting his invidious Thunderbolt at a distance, e're he knew or saw me, or I him, That I am infallibly a great stranger to the dealings of Gods Spirit on the hearts of his People; I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to Justifie my Office, from those Unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Calumnies, and that Grace might be magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, by giving this Relation, in the sight of an All seeing and Omnipresent God, that e're I Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Imposition of Hands, in that Scriptural and Orderly Separation unto my Holy and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial Calling, that I gave requiring satisfaction to Godly, Learned, and Judicious Discerning Men, of a work of Grace and Conversion wrought on my heart, at fifteen years of Age, by, and from the pains of a Godly Schoolmaster, who used no small diligence in Gaining Tender Souls to Gods Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Fear; since which time, to the Glory of his Free Grace be it spoke, I have had the sure Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences of Gods various Dealings with me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Infinite and Unerring Wisdom, to my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> to qualifie for the Ministerial Office; for not only, was this required of me, but is expected of all Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Presbyters; which experience shall enable me not to value what <hi>Keith,</hi> or any other <hi>Quakers</hi> shall ignorantly and groundlesly affirm, in Judging rashly of my State, for we are looked upon as of the World, and they only the People of God, as they commonly Cauterize us, but this is our comfort, we shall not be Judged in the Last Day

by <hi>Quakers,</hi> who must as well as their Neighbours, give an account of their rash and uncharitable judgings to a most Righteous Judge.</p>
            <p>And that it is a Collection from the Scriptures of the Living God, I never will deny, but glory in it; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>He asserts, I declare not that it is God, or Christ, or the Spirit of God, that convinceth or reproveth people of their sins; but this is so false a Calumny<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that none in charity can judge <hi>Keith</hi> to be so great a Perfectionist as he proclaims himself to be; and this every one may be satisfied in, if they will but turn over to page 12 where it is plainly delivered; That God in Turning or Calling Sinners unto himself, does <hi>convince them of Sin and Misery, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten their Minds with the Knowledge of Christ, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

And whereas he charges me with this, that I mention but little of the Spirit of God at all; and that this may appear as false as the former, I refer my self to every Reader, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally those who have read and considered, better then <hi>Keith</hi> hath done; and let them turn over to the several pages, where I have made frequent mention

of the Spirit of God, in so small a Volumn, ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing to him that which was and is his peculiar work. 1.

to the Spirit and Light within, as <hi>John Drummond,</hi> a Reputed and Received Quaker, a Reader of <hi>Keith</hi>'s Books, with many others, who lately at my House at <hi>Poccamok,</hi> before <hi>Keith</hi> and several other Witnesses, published his gross Ignorance of that Fundamental Article, That none could be Saved without-Faith in Jesus Christ; from which I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand since, that he had oft reproached me, drawing his own ignorant conclusions from thence. And if Quakers are ignorant hereof, what can they pretend to know.</p>
            <p>Another general charge is, That I nothing help the Ignorant, neither do I direct them to the true Vision; but whoever will but consider how many Fundamental Truths are laid down in the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism, for the Edification of the Ignorant, and plainly asserted, That Christ teaches his People with his Word and Spirit; and if this be not the true Vision of God, Quakers must lose themselves, and be puzzled in finding of it: but be rather would insinuate what harm it would do, if received, but this may discover how far men are for keeping sinners in ignorance, by possessing their minds with a dislike of this mean of Knowledge, which leads and directs sinners to the Scriptures as the great mean of Knowledge, and profitable for instruction, containing all things <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

               </gap> to be known by Christians; and also to Christ and his Holy Spirit the Author and Efficient Cause of Knowledge, who can Enlighten without means, in a most immediate manner, but most ordinarily conveyes Knowledge by Means and Ordinances of his own Appointment concurring with his Holy Spirit, blessing and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them effectual to whom he pleases. And in

Catechism many savoury truths delivered, no sins, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged, most duties relating to our general and special callings enjoined: Now how the receiving such a form of sound words containing positive Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, should be prejudicial, and <hi>Kieth</hi>'s works stuffed with <hi>Quibling,</hi> and <hi>Sophistical Controversy,</hi> &amp; his teachings filled with often repeated <hi>Calumnys</hi> against all the Reformed Churches, and <hi>Un-scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> or <hi>unheard</hi> of <hi>Long-winded Similitudes,</hi> which amuse the deluded, and ignorant, should become profitable, let every one determine; and I am perswaded, none has received or can receive injury therefrom, but by slighting and disregarding it. And this my experience can testifie, that since the Catechism was opposed by <hi>Quakers,</hi> they have had a more universal, and kindly welcome, and recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And here is no new Doctrine, but what <hi>Keith</hi> had oft seen in the Catechisms of our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches, which he had oft impugned with all his might and Sophistry; and his repeating his old Arguments, is only with vain Ostentation, to show himself among a poor, ignorant, and deluded people, and once possessing them with this, that what he delivers is immediately from the Spirit of God, he may driver what he will, as infallible, and never to be questioned.</p>
            <p>Having answered his Generals, I proceed to examine his particulars; and he suffers not the first page to pass without a Censure, because I have affirmed, God made the World out of Nothing: and that this is not only true, and agreeable to Scripture, that to word and express it otherwise, were inconsistent with the Revelation of God, and it were to jump in with the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:000693_0040_0FA9A196383C60A8"/>
of Gods Truth, for we cannot conceive of Creation; without saying it was made out of Nothing which all describe to be, <hi>Productio ex nihilo;</hi> therefore as many places of Scripture as but mention Creation, say as much as I have done, for which I am quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Did not Creation give the First Being to all things that were made, and consequently were all nothing before God commanded them to be, for was nor Light nothing till God said, <hi>Let there be Light <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </hi> Further, if God made the World, he either made it out of his own Essence, or some pre existent matter from Eternity, or produced it out of nothing. I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume you will not be so absurd as to assert any of the first two, not the first, for so the Essence of God should become divisible and corruptible; not the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, for then some matter should be Co-eternal with God, which were blasphemy to affirm: And it is no small argument of the Omnipotence of God, to declare and affirm, especially to young ones, the Word was made out of nothing, seeing they know not that it is implied in the word Creation; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the Omnipotent Power of God in Creation. Acclamations of Praise are ascribed to him, Psal. 33. 6. <hi>By the word of the Lord were the Heavens made, &amp; all the Host of them, by the breath of his mouth,</hi> Acts 4. 24, In that joynt Acclamation of the Apostles, <hi>Lord thou art good, which hast made Heaven, and Earth, and the Sea, and all that in them is:</hi> And it is no adding to the Word of God, while nothing is delivered but Gods Mind in his Word; though <hi>Keith</hi> next in his pretences to <hi>Nailor</hi> himself should discover so much palpable weakness as to censure it again: And I have also asserted in my Catechism, that there is no work so peculiar to any of the Persons of the Holy Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but all of them have a hand in each; so that his

as the Rule of Faith, and Judge of Controversies, saying, It is written, and Cites the Prophets oft for their Conviction, and charges them with ignorance of the Scripture, as the cause and ground of their Error, saying, <hi>Ye Err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.</hi> And though dim Natures Light, the Rellicks of one fallen from perfection, and the works of Creation, render all inexcusable for their Ignorance of their Creator, yet are very lame, and insufficient fully to teach their Duty, or to discover all their sins, or teach them the knowledge of God and his Son Jesus Christ, our Redeemer, whom <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> say is in ail men; but can this <hi>Jesus</hi> of theirs be the true Christ, and savingly in all men; seeing there are Nations and Kingdoms, who have not the least remote or dim notions of Christ the Son of God, as Saviour, or Mediator between Sinners, and God, <hi>who was in Christ Reconciling the World to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;</hi> and if so as <hi>Quakers</hi> affirm, then blinded Pagan Nations are in as brave a case, as the Churches of Christ, to whom the Oracles of God are committed, who are pronounced blessed beyond all others, at Gods Chosen Inheritance, and particularly from that great and transcending priviledge of enjoying the Revealed Will of God, to whom the Divine Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles were committed, and blinded Nations were our Predecessors, within some few Centuries past.</p>
            <p>And what <hi>Keith</hi> understands by silent waiting on God, which he calls a silence of mind and thoughts; I fear neither he, nor any <hi>Quaker</hi> for him, can ever demonstrate from plain Scripture Testimony; and it is not the first time they have been puzled to tell us what it is, though some have preferred it to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Scriptures, and a Mean appointed of God, for right understanding of the Scriptures; but
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:000693_0044_0FA9A19AB1DD3688"/>
this new notion of theirs is warranted no where is the Scripture; some of them have taken upon them to call it a silent posture of the heart, without think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good or evil; but this is so strange a conceit, that it is inconsistent with the nature of the heart and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of man, which is in the judgment of most, and to solid experience of all, so stirring and active a thing, that it is never at quiet or rest, but always employed about either good or evil, and this so many as call a <hi>Spirit Res C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Another Instance of Scripture waiting, very unlike Quakers waiting you May find in Lam. 3. 26. <hi>It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the Salvation of the Lord;</hi> and let every one be umpire in this case, whether there can be the exercise of those Graces, where the heart thinks neither good nor evil; and they are often puzled to satisfie us, whether their silent waiting be publick or private Worship; for if it is not done in Faith, it must be sin, and consequently no acceptable Service so God, it private of secret, it ought to be gone about with as great secrecy, and to go too pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick

Presence of the things United, as <hi>K.</hi> would insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, and assert in his Paper. For if there can be a Moral Union, and Relation standing firm betwixt a Husband, and Wife, the one in <hi>Europe,</hi> the other in <hi>America,</hi> and a Natural Union, and nigh Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, between Parent, and Child, much more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Christ in Heaven, and believers on Earth, by a Spiritual, and indissolvible Union, by Faith, which is not an absent Christ to Believers, with whom he is by Gracious, and Spiritual Influences in their Hearty.

            <p>And also it is granted that he is the Eternal High-Priest of His Church, who Offered and gave Himself a Sacrifice once upon the Cross for Sinners and by the Efficacious Merits of this Death, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Persons and <hi>S</hi>ervices of his People accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto God, not only Teaching them by His Holy Spirit, what to pray for as they ought; but also continues <hi>an High</hi>-P<hi>riest at the Right-hand of God, making continual</hi> I<hi>ntercession for Believers, Heb.</hi> 7 25. <hi>Wherefore he is able to Save them to the uttermost, that come to God by Him, seeing be ever</hi> L<hi>iveth to make Intercession for us;</hi> all which is fully and soundly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the Catechisms, and Confessions of Faith of our Divines of the <hi>Westminster</hi> Assembly.</p>

            <p>And we never did disown that the special Fruits of all these Three Offices are wrought in the hearts of Believers; which is inconsistent with that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> P<hi>riest, &amp; King</hi> in all men according to <hi>Quakers</hi> Doctrine, while the Scripture affirms, they are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, in whom Christ is not. And it is plain the <hi>Quakers</hi> common Christ, is not the true Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour and Messiah, who only dwells in the hearts of Believers by Faith, and not of Infidels that do not so much as know by any kind of knowledge, and yet they are Enlightned by him, as they say, with a sufficient, and saving knowledge. How unnecessary must it be to multiply Offices in our Mediatour, seeing all are reducible to those Three? and must he not be a Man of a <hi>P</hi>erverse Spirit, and contentious mind, that would raise a Debate upon this head? and <hi>K</hi>'s Evasion and Quibble for this is extreemly silly, and weak; for (saith he) the Commands of Gods Moral Law are reducible to two; yet also branched out into Ten; for the first Division of the Divine Commands, was by God himself into two <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

makes the Enumeration or Division unto ten; but no such Warrant can be produced for this Enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Multiplication of Offices in our Mediator; for it were as impertinent, and idle, as if every Duty required, and every <hi>S</hi>in prohibited in every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, were a new Command; and there should be thrice ten instead of ten; and what must be thought of those that multiply Offices in Christ, calling every thing that Christ is called a new Office in the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, as a <hi>Father,</hi> a <hi>Shepherd,</hi> an <hi>Husband, Physician, &amp;c.</hi> Whence he is called the <hi>Way,</hi> a <hi>Rock,</hi> a <hi>Door,</hi> a <hi>Vine;</hi> all which denote no new Offices, but signifie his Richness, Fulness, Benefits, <hi>L</hi>ove and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to Believers, denoting that Spiritual Relation to Believers, and Christ's usefulness to them in all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states and Conditions.</p>
            <p>His next Charge, Page 10, 11. I have affirmed Christ Died, or was Sacrificed for Sinners. Now let any determine whether this Answer does not set forth the Fruit, and Satisfaction of Christ's Death for Sinners; for if he Died for Sinners, and for our Sins, is it not enough to us; for if we had not been Sinners, we should not have stood in need of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: and if sinners were Redeemed, no others did want it. And tho' he seems to reprehend it with Scripture Language, yet his Charge is more obscure, and defective, then that he finds fault with; either that quarrelled at must be true, or false, or deficient; if true, why Censured, if false, let Quakers speak their minds plainly; if deficient, there must be some for whom Christ Died, besides Sinners. If I have not multiplied words, to humour captious and critical Quakers, I hope I shall never have cause to repent it, where I Studiously avoided all prolixity, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured all succinctness and brevity.</p>

But to return to the matter in hand concerning the Nature, Efficacy, and Extent of Christ's Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we have to do with many Adversaries, whose va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Sentiments are not to be <hi>r</hi>econciled either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselves, or with the Holy Scriptures: for some say, Christ Died absolutely for all, and every individual sinner, and in Laying down his Life, did equally intend the Salvation of all; others say, he Died for all conditionally, from a foreseen condition of Faith; so it was only a conditional Salvation, or Redemption, wherein not one was absolutely Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; this by some is called a possible Salvation; whereby they explain Universal Redemption to be nothing else, then Christ's Pacifying an Angry God for all, and leaving all in a possibility of Salvation if they will; others of a middle sort, say, he Died absolutely for the Elect of God, but conditionally for the Reprobate: But the most unanimous, and received Doctrine of the Reformed Churches, is, That whom Christ Died for, be absolutely and compleatly Redeemed; and that was some Select and Chosen Number, given him <hi>of God the Father,</hi> to Lay down his <hi>L</hi>ife for them, as our Lord himself hints plainly to us in John 17. at large, of which says he, <hi>None was Lost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That I may discover the absurdities of the former Opinion; consider first, Christ's absolute Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for all, and every individual Sinner: For 1. So <hi>Christ</hi> should have intended to have saved those that were actually in Hell, and condemned to Eternal Flames, before his Death, under an Irrevocable Sentence of Wrath. 2. What a Dishonour were it to God to say, he intended, and at so dear a rate, as the Death of his own Son, to go about the Redeeming of those whom he knew from all Eternity should be infallibly
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:000693_0058_0FA9A1A6E4BFBED0"/>
Damned; can it be imagined, <hi>Christ</hi> intended to Save such? 3. If all men and women, were absolutely Redeemed, all should be infallibly Saved, for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion supposes Redemption, and Redemption secures <hi>S</hi>alvation; but it is evident to all, the smallest num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber shall <hi>Enter in at the Strait Gate</hi> 4. If God should purpose and intend the Salvation of all absolutely, and yet the smallest <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Let us view the absurdities and inconsistencies that flow naturally from the universal, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

If so, then it would have been possible, for all to have been Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and not one Saved; for if man had but resisted as it was in his Power, because not absolutely Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, then Christ might have Died really for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and have seen no Fruit of <hi>the Travail of his Soul:</hi> And, Let serious <hi>S</hi>ouls consider what an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>significant Death, and fruitless inefficacious Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption should he have Paid. 2. If a conditional Redemption, and a possibility of Salvation was all that Christ Died for, I would Enquire, Who it is that performs the Condition, God or man; if men can believe or repent of themselves, then the Conditional Salvation, might avail them something; but he cannot believe, it is Gods special Gift, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.

            <p>I Remember in the beginning <hi>Keith</hi> says, <hi>I speak very little of the Spirit of God at all,</hi> which I have already shown in the most convincing, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular manner to be False, by directing the Reader to the particular <hi>P</hi>ages, and now I am to show he contradicteth himself, by owning in several Questions, and Answers, my asserting, <hi>The Spirits Operations, in calling Effectually, in Regeneration, in Working Faith in us, and Uniting us to Christ?</hi> But while he is necessitated to own this; He affirms it, <hi>To be inconsistent with, and contradictory to, my own and</hi> My Brethrens Doctrine; <hi>which he endeavours to confirm, by a far fetched, and inconsequential reason,</hi> because we deny <hi>all extraordinary immediate, and

            <p>But every Christian Reader may discover, in this person, a most Arrogant Spirit, to pretend to know my Principles, and Opinions better than I know them my self, and with impudent falshood, to affirm and declare, I have Published an Account of Principles I do not believe; and that they are repugnant to my Brethrens Doctrine; seeing our publick Confessions of Faith, and Catechisms known to the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian World, sayes the same things, and particularly in the Description of Effectual Calling, which is further confirmed in all our common places, and Bodies of Divinity, and in all the practical Pieces, treating of these Subjects, as Mr. <hi>Allen</hi> of Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Mr. <hi>Burgess,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cole</hi> of Regeneration, and many others; and I am satisfied, how oft I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in publick my Opinion in these matters. I must needs declare, it is an evil Principle, and unfair Undertaking for any to take upon them to Publish Principles, and contradict Principles, of those he is an absolute stranger unto; and it is the true Character of a Deceiver, to possess others with prejudices against our Principles, only by misrepresenting of them, and Fastening Principles on us, which we abhor.

I am quarrelled, for asserting in my Catechism, page 25. This Justification and Adoption, are Acts of God, without us, and and work only a relative Change; and that Justification, Adoption and <hi>S</hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification once had cannot be Lost. As to the first, Justification is according to the Judgment of all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Divines, a gracious Act of Gods Love, in a

Judicial Way, upon the account of Christ's Imputed Righteousness, acquitting, and absolving the sinner from Guilt, and consequently from Condemnation. <hi>I</hi> hope <hi>Quakers</hi> will not jump in with Papists, who assert, Justification to be the making of one Just, and so Confound it with Sanctification, which the Spirit of God makes to be distinct Acts, tho' always unse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable. As to Adoption in its nature, it is Gods Numbering us among his Children, a taking us from among the Children of Satan, and <hi>Giving us a Right to all the Priviledges of Gods Children;</hi> &amp; pray where is the falshood, and danger, in asserting, they are Acts of God without us, bringing Believers into a new Relation unto God, Christ, and the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to whom they are Enemies and <hi>S</hi>trangers by Nature; seeing at the same time we firmly believe, that there is no Relative Change wrought by God on any Sinner, in Justification or Adoption, without a real, saving, inward, gracious, and universal Change upon the whole man by Sanctification, which are as different by the Language of the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> as Sanctification and Glorification is, Rom. 8. And none are Justified or Adopted, but <hi>Sanctified</hi> also; all which is asserted in my Catechism; if <hi>Keith's</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious, Cavelling, and Carping <hi>S</hi>pirit had allowed him to take notice thereof; for none of us hold, that God makes any his people, or children, without a real, gracious <hi>Change,</hi> as <hi>Pen</hi> and <hi>Keith</hi> would invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duously and falsely Calumniate us, and our universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known Doctrine, fairly published to the World; any yet that renewing work is not properly Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but Sanctification, which is a gradual work; whereby the Old man of sin and corruption, <hi>is Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyfyed, and the New man of Grace, Righteousness or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, is r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

And that Justification, Adoption and Sanctification may be Lost, is not only the Doctrine of <hi>Quakers,</hi> but of <hi>Pelagians, Papists</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> too; though <hi>Keith</hi> and <hi>Barclay</hi> own that some may Arrive to such a pitch and measure that they cannot <hi>Fall away;</hi> now this measure must either be higher than Justification, Sanctification, or Regeneration, or they contradict themselves, in opposing Free Grace, and denying the Perseverance of the Saints in Grace with most discouraging and comfortless arguments to Believers, which imply many gross absurdities; and concerning this Head, Mr. <hi>John Brown</hi> our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try man, in confutation of <hi>Barclay,</hi> layes down our unanimous Doctrine, and first animadverts all that we hold, the <hi>P</hi>erseverance of none, but such as are Regenerated; and how false and absurd were it to say, a Sinner Regenerated, or made a Child of God to Day, and yet be a Child of the Devil to morrow, made meet for Heaven, and yet go to Hell, Pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and yet Damned. 2. We do not hold a special and inevitable necessary of Perseverance, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing and lying in Sin, as Enemies would insinuate to the prejudice of Truth, as <hi>Quakers</hi> often have done. 3.

so far from Recanting, Denying, or Giving any sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission for the Charge, that I am the rather confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it was most just and deserving, and that without all shadow of the guilt of a Calumny, and that for these following reasons. 1. Because I never met with any others that in reallity opposed this Doctrine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that Party, and though I might hear common Fame accuse others, and meeting with none of their Writings, I had no Warrant, for including them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the publick Charge, though my Answer does no way exclude them. 2. All the <hi>Quakers</hi> I ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed with in <hi>Europe</hi> or <hi>America,</hi> declared this as their undoubted Judgment, that all Dayes were alike under the Gospel, and none of perpetual Observation as a Day of Rest; and further, That they were as free to Work, or Labour in their several Callings, and Trades on the First Day of the Week, (called now the Christian Sabbath, or Day of Rest, under the Gospel,) as any other Day of the Week; of which I gave, and am able yet to give several Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: And I am lately informed, of several Servants of <hi>Quakers,</hi> otherwise Educated, who have made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint to Magistrates, of their Masters, causing them to follow their daily Labour; and a Witness yet alive, can declare, being on a <hi>Sabbath</hi> at <hi>Thomas Everdens</hi> House, perceived no manner of Worship with his Family, but great diligence in dispatching one of his Servants with Necessaries for Building a Sloop; &amp; I have met one of them with a Gun in the Woods on the Sabbath, or First Day of the Week, while we were going to the Publick Worship of God; if such are not to be looked on, without any just Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation, of an invidious Calumny, Enemies to a Sabbath, let the World judge. 3. They need not make so great a noise, and clamour at this Charge;

            <p>In page 28. I am Charged with Deficiency, concerning Ministers, and that in three things: and I am ready to own I have wilfully Omitted twice three things concerning Ministers Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Call; and pray where is the crime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing there are so full Treatises by others on that Subject already Published; and all I intended in my Catechism for Young Ones, was only to lay down the several Duties of Ministers and People; and if I had been guilty of an Omission in that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numeration, he might have found fault; but I must take notice of an invidious Parenthesis, that Peoples Maintaining their Ministers is a main thing with me. Let the Reader examine my Catechism, and he shall not find ground for this malicious Reflection; for it is expressed in as few words as any other Duty with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out in fisting thereon, and this was the expression of an absolute Strange<hi>r</hi> to me, and my practice in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to a Maintainance, to which I am bold to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert, <hi>I</hi> have been ever undenied as <hi>Keith,</hi> or any of his Brethren. And whatever others have done, I dare affirm, I never bargained with any people about a Maintainance; and have oft refused mony when free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offered, and never Enjoyed any Maintainance, but what was most freely offered to me; though I deny not to the Magistrate, a power of Determining Maintainances, when Necessity requires it; and none so unwilling to pay it as perverse <hi>Quakers,</hi> though <hi>I</hi> could wish it were voluntary Offerings; yet this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Author would insinuate, as if Presbyterians only
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:000693_0075_0FA9A1B434721238"/>
were Guilty; exacting Maintainance by force; whereas he cannot be ignorant, that the Maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Ministers in <hi>Scotland,</hi> are not to be compared to what Prelates have, whether Popish or Protestant, neither for quantity, not manner of Exacting. And it is observable, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> have been brawling and barking unreasonably against all who receive Maintainance, as Hirelings; but the greatest Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions among them, were never able to defend so bad a Cause, as they have been tenacious in for a long time; though now of late, they seem to change their Tunes, and own a Maintainance, providing it be voluntary, and not by Compulsion, as <hi>Barclay</hi> has owned, who has taken upon him to <hi>P</hi>ublish <hi>Quakers</hi> Principles, though he never produced any Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for it; and I am perswaded, he will find it as hard a matter to procure their universal Consent, and Approbation to all he has Wrote; but a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters Maintainance among <hi>Quakers</hi> must be volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and free, for they would never Exact it by force, for two Reasons 1. Because they never had the Government solely in their Hands, for in <hi>Pensilvania</hi> they are a mixed people; neither would the Infancy of that Plantation bear it; beside that, their former Railings would have Retorted upon themselves. 2. Because of the multitude of their Teachers, and the Weakness of many of them, that dare not claim a Right to any such Maintainance, as many silly wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and ignorant Mechanicks And it must be for measure or quantity, a necessary Competency, or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liment, as <hi>Barclay</hi> calls it; but must <hi>Quakers</hi> only be Judges of this Competency, or should the Giver, or rather the Civil Magistrate to determine it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the several Abilities of the People: And consider what narrow and niggardly Souls these peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

have, who would allow no more to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Gospel, then common Charity obliges them to give to the most common beggar that goes from Door to Door, even a necessary Competency, and Aliment; whereas <hi>M</hi> inisters should have such a Maintainance as they may not be necessitated to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle, and incumber themselves with secular Affairs, and be diverted from their holy Office, and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial Calling, whereunto they have been Called, and to which they are to be Separated according to the Command of God, concerning <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas;</hi> and further, they ought to have such an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Allowance, as they may not only Live an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to their Station, and be able to maintain Duties to Hospitality, which <hi>Quakers</hi> Competency, and necessary Aliment, will never render them capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to perform: And it were no hard matter to prove, that many <hi>Quakers,</hi> even <hi>Keith</hi> and <hi>Barclay</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, whose Birth, Education, Travels and Estates are known to many yet alive, have had much more given then their necessary Aliment.</p>

But the same Apostle pleads for, and reasons the case fully, 1 Cor. 9. wherein he has many convincing Arguments against all Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers in the world; proving first, That the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of Ministers and Families is warrantable, from 4, 5, 6 verses. 2.

them of another Nature, <hi>&amp;</hi> of greater weight, <hi>amp; of</hi> a considerable continuance; some say for fifteen Months, e're that Fire of contenton broke forth into a Flame</p>
            <p n="2">2. That these Twenty Eight pretended Preachers at this time look on <hi>George Keith</hi> and consequently all his Party, none of their present but late Friend, and consequently now their Enemy; and so the name Friend must no longer be a general Epithite or universal title peculiar to that Party, o<hi>r George Keith</hi> must be only a Late <hi>Quaker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Occasion of all this Clamour, <hi>&amp;</hi> Heat, is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by <hi>K.</hi> pag. 2 To be an Accusation of <hi>K</hi> by <hi>W. Stockdale,</hi> an ancient <hi>Quaker Teacher, For Preaching two Christs;</hi> because he Preached <hi>Faith in Christ with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them, &amp; Faith in Christ without;</hi> and if this was a new thing from <hi>K.</hi> his frequent <hi>Teaching</hi> before, must have been void <hi>of</hi> Christ, and so Christless Sermons; or if he did, it was so obscurely delivered, that he was never plainly understood till now: But <hi>K</hi> having dealt privately with the said <hi>Stockdale,</hi> but unsuccessful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, laid his complaint before twelve <hi>of</hi> their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, in a <hi>meeting</hi> at <hi>Rt. Ewers</hi> house, who rather defended and excused <hi>Stockdale,</hi> then Condemned him; whereby ten <hi>of</hi> these able <hi>Doctors,</hi> two only dissenting, became as Guilty <hi>of</hi> Ignorance &amp; Errors as <hi>Stockdale</hi> himself. And next the Yearly Meeting at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and so at length, six several Meetings had this matter in debate, and under their determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; who gave so slender a determination at last, that they all appeared rather at a stand and demurr about it; &amp; <hi>K.</hi> Justly accuses them of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, ignorance, <hi>&amp;</hi> Unbelief <hi>pag.</hi> 4. <hi>Reader,</hi> all may easily perceive from the unchristian Labyrinth, in which these men have involved themselves about so

weighty and so plain a Fundamental, how great Strangers they are to the True knowledge of the Gospel Mystery <hi>of</hi> Christ Jesus; that of six seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Meetings <hi>of</hi> their greatest Dons, in the three fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Governments, they are in confusion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Christ to be Believed in, for our Salvation; and understand not Christ as he is Revealed in the Scriptures, God Man, Suffering and Dying for us; whence it is evident, what Christ the generality of <hi>Quakers</hi> have been hitherto believing in; which is clear from the Prayer of <hi>Thomas Fittz-Watter,</hi> at a Meeting, saying <hi>O God that Dyed in us, and</hi> L<hi>aid down thy Life in us, and took it up again. &amp;c.</hi> Which <hi>G K</hi> justly called blasphemy: if this Spiritual Man, suppose Christ as God Mortal, is most inconsistant with Scripture, which affirms; <hi>that to him belongs Immortality, and absolute Eternity;</hi> both <hi>a parte ante &amp; post:</hi> and by this prayer, directs in to something within himself, and not according to Divine Pattern, to <hi>Our Father in Heaven;</hi> and <hi>Rt. Young</hi> one of their pretended Teachers said, <hi>that he did not find Christ without in all the Scriptures; and further, that Christ, when he ascended into the Cloud, was seperated from his Body;</hi> and <hi>Arthur Cook,</hi> accused <hi>G.

horrour, when they consider the deplorable case of such, as are Lead, and Taught by these men; who openly, publickly, and avowedly, profess their Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance <hi>of</hi> the true Christ, which is but One, and can be no other; even, <hi>He that was Born of the Virgin Mary, Suffered in the World, was Crucified with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Gates of</hi> Jerusalem; <hi>was Buried, &amp; Rose again, with the same Body, having his wounds upon him, as he shewed to</hi> Thomas <hi>the</hi> Apostle; <hi>&amp; after some time of Converse in the World, proving thereby the Reality of his Resurrection, was received Bodily into a Cloud, in the open view of his</hi> Apostles, <hi>and Ascended into Heaven, &amp; now</hi> Sits <hi>at the Right Hand of God the Father, making con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual intercession for sinners; &amp; the same Man-Christ, that Liveth for Ever, &amp; Ever, shall come in his Glory, with all his Holy Angels, to Judge the World in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness at the Last Day:</hi> All which is abundantly testified in the Holy Scriptures. And now whosoever Believes not in Christ, nor receives him as described in the Word of God; seeing he himself says, <hi>John</hi> 5. 39. <hi>They are they that testify of him;</hi> it may warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably be concluded, they believe not in him at all; &amp; therefore I leave it to others to determine, what sort of <hi>Christians Quakers</hi> must needs be; and also what we must judge <hi>of</hi> their Sufficient, <hi>&amp;</hi> Saving, <hi>&amp;</hi> Divine Light, of which they have been boasting universally; and magnifying them selves from above all others in the world; and what do they now think of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate <hi>Call,</hi> and Apostolick <hi>Mission,</hi> seeing they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover themselves so grosly Ignorant, and so much in the dark the Foundation of our Salvation, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Christ Jesus, who is so fully described in the very Letter of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>And this Breach is Risen to such a height, that the Railings, Revilings, bitter &amp;uncharitable Accusations,
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:000693_0098_0FA9A14B1F188688"/>
they were wont to vomit maliciously, against all the Reformed Churches, are now justly turned against one another; for <hi>Lloyd</hi> and his Party fly out against <hi>Keith,</hi> calling him a Reviler of the Brethren, Brat of <hi>Babylon,</hi> Accuser <hi>of the Brethren;</hi> one that alwayes endeavoureth to keep down the power of Truth; drawing from the Gift of God; calling him also Pope, Primate of P<hi>ensilvania,</hi> Father Confessor, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing him of Envy, extream Passion, a turbulent &amp; unsubdued Spirit: Let the Authors of these make good their Charge, or let them take what follows. Shall ever such a man be followed by such as have given him such a monstrous Character, as none but the greatest of Impostors deserve; and it is observable, that in all which <hi>K</hi> has Published, for he has carried the day in his Prints; that he has not fairly, nor fully Explained himself, for it wants to be determined, when Christ is said to be in all men, by the name Light; whether he and his Party, who say with all <hi>Quakers,</hi> He is substantially in them, believe him to be in them as Mediator and <hi>S</hi>aviour, as <hi>K</hi> seems to assert in his <hi>Grounds of Separation.</hi> pag. 32 &amp; <hi>William</hi> P<hi>en,</hi> in Reason against Railing, asserts the true Light with which every man is Enlightned, to be sufficient for Salvation; and how P<hi>en, G.

K.</hi> affirmed, That no such Damnable Heresies, and Doctrines of Devils were Tolerated in any Protestant Society, as among <hi>Quakers,</hi> at <hi>Philadelphia;</hi> if this Charge is true, I am perswaded it will extend to most <hi>Quakers</hi> in the World, or they must yet be in Confusion and Unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined about their Principles Many other most dangerous Positions were urged and disputed among them, savouring of nothing but Blindness and Error, as one that owned no man Christ Jesus as Mediator in Heaven without him, but the Grace of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and also the Christ was only a Spirit in Heaven, and had nothing of the Body; and many of them denying the Day of Judgment, and any Resurrection, but what they have already attained; &amp; <hi>John Wills<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> said, Christ was a Mediator for no Drunkards &amp; wicked persons, but for his own Disciples; many <hi>of</hi> them denied Gods Presence in all his Creatures, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing most ignorantly, and blasphemously: if God be in Herbs and Grass, then who tramples on them, tramples on God; and this occasioned a new Dispute, whether God be present in Lice? Some denying they were any part of the Creation; another Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, that Christ Cureth mens Souls perfectly at once, and makes them free of all sin; and when we are perfect, we are Kings, and are not to Beg or Pray to God for our selves: another says Whether that Body that was Crucified, be in Heaven, Let the Church determine? one <hi>Samuel Ginnings</hi> declared in a Meeting, <hi>That to do Gods Business we needed Gods Wisdom,</hi> but to do our own Business as men, we needed it not! another affirmed, <hi>That a man might

speak unsound Words in the</hi> L<hi>ife;</hi> and at another Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the same man bids us wait, <hi>That the Scepter might depart from</hi> Judah, <hi>that</hi> Shiloh <hi>might come.</hi> Is it not evident from these gross, impertinent, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable Ignorances, and Blasphemous Heresies, <hi>That God has justly given them over to a Spirit of</hi> Delusion, to believe the grossest Lyes that ever was hatcht; and that for their ambitious and deceiving pretences to unwarrantable Inspirations. Another Quarrel was, <hi>G. K'</hi>s Objecting against their Discipline, as too Loose; but for my part, I never knew, nor heard any they had that was purely Ecclesiastick; &amp; what they pretended to was most absolute and arbitrary: tho' I understand of late <hi>G. K.</hi> had Composed a new Draught in many particulars, which tho' not allowed a Reading at their Yearly Meeting, yet was sent to the Yearly Meeting at <hi>London,</hi> for their Approbation &amp; Sanction: of which I shall give my Reader a small tast in these following particulars: 1. That all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Friends shall give in a few words less or more a pure Confession unto the Truth generally Received by Friends. 2. If Friends be satisfied with this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, they are to express their Christian Love, and signifie their owning them, by taking them by the hand, or giving the hand unto them. 3. That all Friends who have Children come to years of Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whom they have Instructed in the Principles <hi>of</hi> Truth, that they further Labour with their Children to be willing to be Received into the Number of Friends, in the manner above mentioned. 4. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there should not be Elders and Deacons Chosen, and Appointed, and Named by the Consen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the whole Church, for the Help and Assistance of the Friends of the Ministry. 5. That no raw and unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned persons do presume to speak or pray in the
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:000693_0102_0FA9A1476EE2CAD8"/>
Meetings, until they give proof of their sound Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Experience, and Spiritual Abilities to their Elder Brethren, the Elders and the Church. 6. That no Friends joyn in Marriage with any, but such as are Received into the Society of Fiends, by a solemn Confession of their Faith, and Profession of Truth in the manner aforesaid.</p>
            <p>These are but a few of many Articles of the like nature, which had a very cold Reception, that tho' they did not allow it a publick Reading, yet cry'd it down as downright Popery; but sure if this take place, <hi>Quakers</hi> will look with another Face then ever they have yet done; and many of their silly, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and impertinent, and blaspemous Teachers, Shall be laid aside as useless. And the Breach was so great, that the two Emissaryes from <hi>London,</hi> T.<hi>W.</hi> and <hi>J D.</hi> was so far from accomplishing a Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leation, that they Condemned him for the Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and pronounced Woes against him; and <hi>J. D.</hi> compared the Difference there, to Childrens falling out about trifles; sure these men so much admired at <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> and elsewhere, discover both their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and weakness in joyning with the strongest Party, the Magistrates;and looking upon the <hi>Doctrine of Christ Crucifyed,</hi> and the <hi>Sufficiency of the</hi> L<hi>ight within</hi> to be but Trifles.</p>
            <p>Lastly, <hi>G. K</hi> is blamed for calling <hi>W. Stockdal,</hi> and a whole Meeting, ignorant Heathens; but says <hi>Keith,</hi> if there is Light sufficient to Salvation in all men without the man Christ, then an honest Heathen is a true Christian; hence every man may Learn, That honest Heathens are good <hi>Quakers,</hi> or <hi>Quakers</hi> are good Heathens.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>George Keith</hi> having his Sentence, Lay under Charges and no possibility of obtaining (as he says)

Frivolous, arising from a Nicety and circumstance of Place, which as carryed by a Plurality of Votes, tho' <hi>K</hi> would not submit to it, without the Una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous Consent of all; which he says is the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed method of Friends; but it is not to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed if the Plurality had determined for him, he would never have gone about to invalidate the determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and if the Unanimous consent of all be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite in such trifles, we expect <hi>K</hi> will do nothing in greater Matters without it 3 <hi>Reason:</hi> because most Gross, and Unchristian Errors, against the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Doctrines of the Christian Faith, are held by divers of them that are Publick Teachers, &amp; many are Unqualified for the Ministry; this is a weighty Ground indeed, and a just Cause; and it is not to be doubted, but applicable to both Partys; so that a seperation from them both is Warrantable, which all good Christians are to pray that God may accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish to the Glory of his own Name, and the Honour of Truth as the Issue of the begun Controversy and Confusions; and alass! it must be strange, that all these things have been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Whether Christ's Body that was Nailed to the Cross, and was Buried, and Arose again, be with him in Heaven? Some of them saying, as <hi>Keith</hi> told me at his House, it never Rose, but Evanished, or Remained in the Grave: others saying, it arose, but after it Ascended in the Cloud, was separated from it: others say, it is a Nicety, and to be ignorant of it, does not hinder a man from being a true Christian, and a Minister of Christ: Others saying, it is a dividing of Christ. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers accusing of some, for Denying the <hi>Sufficiency of the Light within;</hi> from all which it is evident, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding of all their high pretences to Immediate Inspirations, and Extraordinary Illuminations from the Spirit of God, what great Error, Ignorance, and Blindness, they discover to the World. 1. Their
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:000693_0106_0FA9A14BF0EA04B8"/>
Ignorance of Christ Jesus our Saviour, <hi>whom to Know is External Life;</hi> and whom <hi>Quakers</hi> say, is, &amp; dwells substantially in all of them; and if so, could it be possible to Remain so Ignorant of him, as they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim themselves to be; and who in their right wits, but must look upon them as deluded Souls, rather than Inspired from Heaven. 2. They know not how necessary the Faith and Knowledge of the true Christ as Mediator, is, to make a true Christian, &amp; real Minister; hence they plainly tell us. what Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians and Ministers will pass among <hi>Quakers,</hi> even such as neither know Christ aright, nor believe the true Knowledge of him necessary; seeing they call Christ man, Ascended and Glorified in Heaven, a Nicety; conclude all such, Christless Christians, and Christless Ministers.</p>

mind yet in that point, as he says of other things. 6. He Transiently runs over the Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. 7. He continues to cry down Swearing, in Witnessing to Truth; while they decry the name, they really maintain and practice the thing in all Courts in <hi>Pensilvania.</hi> 8. He fills up a whole Sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Faith, with Baptism, and the Lords Supper; but seeing it is known to all, they deny the use of both, they should be ashamed ever to Treat of them at all; especially among their Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals; for he might as well have filled up a Section with <hi>Circumcision,</hi> and the P<hi>assover:</hi> if it be only to deceive, this is no ingenuous dealing. 9 If plain Language and plain Habits be Fundamentals with <hi>Quakers,</hi> what need is there of any other mark to know a <hi>Quaker</hi> by: and why the Language of others, are not as plain as <hi>Quakers,</hi> I know not; es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, <hi>as Jacob Tilman,</hi> when Preaching &amp; Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Dutch,</hi> to an <hi>English</hi> Congregation. Lastly, I fear, according to his Description of Church of Christ, who ought, as he sayes, to manifest their Faith, to one another, by the Confession of the mouth;there will no such be found among Quakers, who never had any publick, and unanimous Confession of their Faith, yet extant; otherwise there would be no room for the present Division, about the greatest of Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals. In the next place, I proceed to take notice of <hi>G. K'</hi>s Appeal from the twenty eight Judges, and it has a cunning and ambiguous Title, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr>
               <hi>To the Spirit of Truth &amp; true Judgment, in all Faithful Friends called</hi> Quakers; <hi>that meet at the Yearly Meeting at</hi> Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington; whereby any man may perceive, if they judge and determine against him, he has a back Door to fly out at, and will not stand to their judgment; therefore his Appeal is most idle, and
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:000693_0109_0FA9A14E392BF4B0"/>
an empty Bravado; for either he looks on them, as Competent Judges, or not; if competent Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, why does he not submit himself to their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, without such a Reservation; or thus, if he believes them to have the Spirit of Truth, why does he scruple a submission to the judgment of Friends, as <hi>Quakers</hi> are commonly called, if they have not the <hi>Spirit of Truth,</hi> whether it were not safer to wave the Appeal which has the ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a dubious Oracle, for still it must terminate here; if the whole Meeting should not be of <hi>K'</hi>s judgment, he shall declare them destitute of the <hi>S</hi>pirit <hi>of Truth, and void of true judgment;</hi> for he has disapproved the plurality <hi>of</hi> Votes in another case. And in the Appeal, there is first by way of Preamble, the Grounds thereof laid down; and next, twelve particulars by way of Query proposed to be Debated at the said Yearly Meeting, which highly offended the Governour, with the rest of the Magistracy that were <hi>Quakers;</hi> and particularly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges them, tho' it is all along by way of Question, with giving a Commission to, and hiring men to Fight, by recovering a Sloop from Privateers, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Principles of <hi>Quakers</hi> who are against <hi>the use of the Carnal Weapon, which they transgress also by providing the Indians with Powder, and Lead, to fight against other Indians; and a so that one of those pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ministers Taught, not to take an Eye for an Eye; &amp; in a short time, by passing Sentence on Malefactors, takes Life for</hi> L<hi>ife; and finally enquires, whether there is any Example for it in Scripture, or in all</hi> Christendom, <hi>That Ministers should Ingross the Worldly Government, as they do in</hi> Philadelphia, <hi>which hath proved of very evil tendency.</hi> Now the last particular proves so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive, Governour L<hi>loyd</hi> after some Consultation,

sends <hi>for</hi> a Taylor, who had Nail'd up the Appeal on a Board at his Shop Window, to publick view; and after some Examination, he told them, he was not ashamed, to look Persecutors in the Face, but being Required to give Securities, to answer the Quarter Sessions; they gave him till to morrow morning, to provide them; but from what sharp Retorting An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, he gave them, he was dismissed without any further noise: but immediately sent for the Printer, and Requiring Securities of him, which he denied; his <hi>Shop</hi> was Searched, and all the said Papers, and his Printing Letters, to the value of Ten Pounds <hi>Sterling,</hi> as <hi>K.</hi> says, were taken away; and the said Printer, <hi>William Bradford</hi> was Committed to the Sheriffs House as a Prison. And another <hi>John Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>komb,</hi> sent for, and Committed, for Selling some of the said Papers at his House, all which was done in a Legal Mittimus, charging the Printer, and Seller as Publishers; which was a mistake, for properly the Author is the Publisher; &amp; this makes a great noise, both in City and Countrey, that <hi>Quakers</hi> begin to Imprison and <hi>P</hi>ersecute one another, proving what they would do to others if they had power, opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and provocation; but to wipe off all suspicion of Persecution, they make use of the same plea as all other <hi>P</hi>ersecutors do, even the Disturbance of the Peace, and Subversion of the Government: but this <hi>S</hi>alve will not Cure the Sore: The next measures taken, is, to Consult how to punish <hi>G K.</hi> the known Author; and as many of the Subscribers as were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Government: and next day being the 26<hi>th of August</hi> a Conclave was appointed; but two of the Commissioners being no <hi>Quakers,</hi> Dissenting, they could not bring it to bear, to Sign a Mittimus, for Committing <hi>K;</hi> therefore next day, resolves to publish

a Proclamation against <hi>G K</hi> discharging him, or his A betters from publishing any such Seditious Papers for the future; but it is Observable, that in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation there is not any mention made of Their Majesties Names; which every Loyal Subject must Resent; but of the Late K. twice, notwithstanding they had Caution given, to mention what King they meant, <hi>Verbum set Sapienti</hi> But the former Prisoners continue still in Confinement; which is palpable and most evident Partiality, to punish the Printer &amp; Seller, and suffer the known Author, and Subscribers to escape. But on the <hi>Monday</hi> following, the Appeal, with the Mittimus, and a Postscript is Re printed; and in the Postscript, as is very Remarkable, that it is Asserted by <hi>K</hi> that it is contrary to <hi>Quakers</hi> princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, to make use of the <hi>Carnal Weapon;</hi> but they found in their Experience, it was impossible to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Magistracy without it, that is, the <hi>Carnal Sword,</hi> who can but smile to see these men overthrowing their own Principles, by asserting the Inconsistency of them with Magistracy, which is an Ordinance of God; and consequently no Government should be put into <hi>Quakers</hi> Hands: but great things were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from the Yearly Meeting at <hi>Burlington,</hi> which was to begin within few days; tho' little expectation of a Friendly Accommodation; for <hi>G K.</hi> kept out of Town, lest he should by a Prison, be prevented to attend that Meeting; but <hi>K</hi> came off there with Flying Colours; for the other Party being Summo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned again and again to Appeal, but declined it: Whether they disowned the Authority of that <hi>M</hi>eet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or suspected the badness of their Cause, which they had reason to do, or feared <hi>G. K.</hi> his Party to be too strong, they can best answer for themselves; but that Meeting justifyed <hi>G K</hi> and condemned <hi>Lloyd</hi>

               </gap> their former Judgment, by a publick Writing; and how this Order was slighted, is too palpable to be denied, both Parties are discharged from Raising, which sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses both were guilty; but while the Meeting at <hi>Burlington</hi> clears <hi>K.</hi> the Yearly Meeting at <hi>Maryland,</hi> condemns him, and justifies the other Party, whereby that infallible Discerning Spirit <hi>Quakers</hi> boast of, &amp; say is in every true <hi>Quaker,</hi> is overthrown; for great Meetings of their greatest Dons, can be mistaken, &amp; make contrary and contradictory Orders. I am In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, the Division has Reached <hi>England;</hi> for in <hi>London,</hi> one Party who were against <hi>Keith,</hi> bought up all his Pamphlets, to prevent the Spreading of the Difference: Another Party Orders a new Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of all his Books, relating to that Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy; this I had lately of one of themselves. I shall conclude with some passages from undoubted Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. 1. One affirmed the Difference at present concerning Christ, was an empty Barrel, from whence it is evident, what mean thoughts this Zealote had of Christ, as Man. 2. Another said, he did not believe to be Saved by that which Dyed <hi>at Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi> What a poor case must such a Soul be in? 2, <hi>John Delava!</hi> hath exprest his fear that <hi>Cotton Mather'</hi>s Prophesie of <hi>G. K</hi> is now accomplishing. Lastly, there is among <hi>Quakers</hi> in <hi>Pensilvania,</hi> one <hi>Jacob,</hi> a <hi>Dutchman,</hi> who takes upon him to Preach and Pray in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Language, to an <hi>English</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, pretending an Immediate Call thereunto which <hi>John Delaval,</hi> and the Teachers Son-in-law used to Interpret, for the understanding of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but some time after, the Hearers desired the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters to forbear, for they were more Edified
