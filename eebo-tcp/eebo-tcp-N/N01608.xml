            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I. It is moſt certain, That SIN muſt be <hi>Puniſhed</hi> in <hi>Destructive Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries</hi> upon the Sinner; a <hi>Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> proceeding from the Juſt Reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of GOD The Holy GOD has given us a <hi>Law,</hi> which requires our Homage unto Him, and our Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto our Neighbour. And a <hi>Just Law</hi> it is! While the great GOD is what He is, and His Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Man, is what He is, there will be ſuch Things <hi>due,</hi> as His <hi>Law</hi> has thus required. We muſt for ever own, Pſal. CXIX. 142. <hi>Thy Righteouſneſs is an everlasting Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and thy Law is the Truth.</hi> 'Tis a <hi>Law</hi> Originally written on the Tables of our Hearts; and upon the Defacing of thoſe Writings in our Fall from GOD, we have it more fully Explained in the <hi>Sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> which the <hi>Prophetick Spirit</hi> has provided for us. In this <hi>Law</hi> there is a <hi>Puniſhment</hi> aſſign'd for the <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion</hi> of it. Indeed, it were not a <hi>Law,</hi> if it were not arm'd with a <hi>Penalty.</hi> And ſtill there is <hi>Juſtice</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:001910_0008_0FB9D2B038DD0990"/>
in all of this.

It is <hi>Juſt,</hi> That when the <hi>Law</hi> of the Holy GOD has been <hi>Tranſgreſs'd,</hi> the Crime ſhould be puniſhed in thoſe <hi>Destructive Miſeries,</hi> which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to it belong unto the Sinner. The <hi>Destructive Miſeries</hi> of the Sinner, are the <hi>Just Revenges</hi> of GOD upon him, demanding a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,</hi> and a <hi>Reparation,</hi> for the Violations of His <hi>Law.</hi> The <hi>Justice</hi> of GOD herein <hi>Vindicates</hi> His Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olated Law; <hi>Magnifies it and makes it Honourable.</hi> And herein He aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts and exerts thoſe His Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, which have been <hi>Denied,</hi> been <hi>Defied,</hi> been <hi>Reproached</hi> in our <hi>Sin;</hi> For every <hi>Sin</hi> does <hi>deny the GOD that is Above.</hi> Wherefore, from the <hi>Justice</hi> of GOD it now comes to paſs, That no <hi>Sin</hi> can be <hi>committed,</hi> but it muſt be <hi>Puniſhed.</hi> Either the Sinner muſt himſelf be

               <hi>miſerable;</hi> or elſe, One muſt be found, that may be a <hi>Surety</hi> for the Sinner, and ſhall <hi>Smart</hi> for it. That word, Rom. VI. 23. <hi>The Wages of Sin is Death:</hi> and that word, Prov. XIII. 21. <hi>Evil purſueth Sinners;</hi>—'Tis a word that muſt be Executed. The Truth of a GOD <hi>that cannot lye,</hi> ſtands engaged for the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it.

It is truly affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, Rom.

<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001910_0012_0FB9D2BFB65E8888"/>
Effects of it, when thou haſt left the World. I requſt every ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Man to make the Reflection; <hi>Friend,</hi> when thou haſt been doing an <hi>Ill Thing,</hi> has not ſomething within thee, told thee, <hi>A Just GOD will one day puniſh thee for this!</hi> Oh! Do not ſlight ſuch unfailing, ſuch amazing praeſages; <hi>Fools!</hi> Do not any more <hi>make a mock of Sin,</hi> as you uſe to do!</p>
            <p>Secondly. The Thing is yet more clearly and fully diſcovered, in the <hi>Book</hi> that is <hi>given by Inſpiration of GOD.</hi> Our BIBLE has the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtible marks of ſuch a <hi>Book.</hi> Now that <hi>Sin</hi> will be <hi>puniſhed</hi> by the <hi>Justice</hi> of GOD in <hi>Destructive Miſeries</hi> upon the Sinner; This is that unto which our <hi>Bible</hi> does a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly Teſtify. Of our <hi>Bible</hi> we may ſay, Rom. I. 18. Here <hi>The wrath of GOD is Revealed from Heaven againſt all Ungodlineſs and Unrighteouſneſs of Men.</hi> The <hi>Book</hi> of GOD is Expanded like the Firmament of Heaven over the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001910_0013_0FB9D2C27B06DAE8"/>
Church of GOD. In this Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>the GOD of Glory thunders;</hi> That <hi>Powerful Voice</hi> of GOD is ever now and then, heard Thundering there; <hi>The Justice of GOD will not let Sin go unpuniſhed!</hi> That Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Voice of <hi>Juſtice</hi> is here uttered from the Mouth of GOD, <hi>Wo to the Wicked, it ſhall go ill with him, for the Reward of his hands ſhall be given him;</hi> That Thundering Voice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>GOD will render Tribulation &amp; Wrath, Indignation and Anguiſh, upon every Soul of Man which doeth Evil.</hi> In this Book, how often do we find Things of ſuch an Aſpect as this! <hi>I will puniſh you according to the Fruit of your Doings, ſaith the Lord.</hi> How often is the <hi>Anger</hi> of a Glorious GOD againſt <hi>Sin</hi> here told unto us! Yea, with Terms that carry the higheſt Indignation in them! We muſt not imagine any <hi>Paſſion</hi> in the Infinite GOD, like what there is in <hi>Angry Men!</hi> But ſuch Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are uſed, as <hi>Philo</hi> ſays well, <hi>For the Inſtruction of the Multitude.</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:001910_0014_0FB9D2C3F2629EE0"/>
There is no <hi>Perturbation of Mind</hi> like that of our <hi>Anger,</hi> in the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious God. But it means, <hi>A Juſtice Reſolved that Sin ſhall be puniſhed.</hi> Thus tis that <hi>GOD is Angry every Day!</hi> Theſe, Theſe muſt be our <hi>Doxologies</hi> unto Him; O Lord, <hi>Thou art not a GOD that has pleaſure in Wickedneſs; neither ſhall evil dwell with thee; The fooliſh ſhall not ſtand in thy ſight; Thou hatest all workers of Iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. You have been told, That <hi>Sin</hi> muſt be <hi>Puniſhed.</hi> But, <hi>when,</hi> and <hi>where,</hi> ſhall the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed? The Propoſition, which you were called but now to <hi>come and ſee,</hi> was like the <hi>Pale Horſe</hi> whereof you read in the <hi>Apocalypſe.</hi> You have ſeen <hi>Death</hi> mounted, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the Sinner; and <hi>Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Ground with fierce Rage</hi> in the ſwift Advances of it. But now, <hi>HELL follows.</hi> I am now to tell you, That the <hi>Deſtructive miſeries</hi> brought in the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> of Sin up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sinner; are chiefly reſerved
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001910_0015_0FB9D2CCEF908768"/>
for an HELL in a FUTURE STATE; And there will be a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction</hi> brought both on the <hi>Soul</hi> and on the <hi>Body,</hi> of the Sinner, in that aſtoniſhing <hi>Puniſhment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is very plain, That the <hi>Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> which the GOD of Truth has Threatened for <hi>Sin,</hi> is not inflicted in the <hi>Preſent State.</hi> The <hi>Threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenings</hi> of GOD which are all <hi>True and Faithfull,</hi> and ſhall <hi>ſurely come to paſs,</hi> are not fulfilled in the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State.</hi> The <hi>Sentence against e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Works</hi> is not ſo <hi>ſpeedily Executed,</hi> but that the <hi>Ungodly</hi> often <hi>Proſper in the World,</hi> neither are <hi>they plagued like others,</hi> nor are there any <hi>Bonds in their Death:</hi> At the ſame time, The Children of GOD, may ſay, <hi>All the Day long have I been plagued.</hi> But, O you that have your <hi>Hearts fully ſet in you to do Evil,</hi> From this very Thing you may Conclude, That there is a FUTURE STATE, wherein the <hi>Puniſhment of Sin,</hi> will be ſuch that it ſhall be according to that word; <hi>Mine Eye ſhall not ſpare,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001910_0016_0FB9D2CE0B239000"/>
neither will I have pitty; I will recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence thee,</hi> O Sinner, <hi>according to thy ways, and ye ſhall know, that I am the Lord, who ſmites you!</hi> The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment lies thus; If there be a <hi>Just GOD</hi> it muſt be ſo! If there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Juſtice in Heaven,</hi> there muſt be an HELL wherein there will be found, <hi>A ſtrange Puniſhment reſerved for the workers of Iniquity.</hi> O Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curean Atheiſts, If you try to weaken the Foundation of this aſtoniſhing Argument, GOD has placed an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer within you, who will <hi>tear you in pieces, and there ſhall be none to deliver you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They are ſuch <hi>Important,</hi> but ſo very <hi>Terrible,</hi> Things which are now to be publiſhed among you, That you may well demand ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable, ſome ungainſayable, <hi>Demonſtrations</hi> of them. Now, I call to mind a ſaying, Luk. XVI. 31. <hi>If they hear not Moſes and the Prophets, neither will they be perſwaded, though one Roſe from the Dead.</hi> We have had <hi>coming to us from the Dead,</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:001910_0017_0FB9D2D14C335E08"/>
ſuch Things among our ſelves, that a Man muſt render himſelf unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a Converſation among <hi>Men,</hi> who ſhall deny the <hi>matters of Fact,</hi> and the plain Conſequences of them, <hi>That there is a World of Evil Spirits;</hi> and, therefore alſo, <hi>a World of good Ones.</hi> But I wave theſe Proofs; Nor indeed will Wicked People <hi>hear them.</hi> I will carry you to one who is Greater than <hi>Moſes and the Prophets;</hi> even Him, who was by <hi>Moſes and the Prophets</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended unto us; One alſo who is <hi>Riſen from the Dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of our Bleſſed JESUS from the Dead, has had ſuch <hi>Infallible Proofs,</hi> that nothing but ſome <hi>Satanick Energy</hi> can make any <hi>Man</hi> ſuch a <hi>Bruit,</hi> as to admit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Doubt upon it. Now the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection</hi> of our Bleſſed JESUS from the <hi>Dead,</hi> is a Victorious <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration,</hi> That He is the SON of GOD, and the <hi>CHRIST, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the World,</hi> and that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever He has Declared in His Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001910_0018_0FB9D2D242B4A850"/>
is to be relied upon. Well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We will now hear what our Bleſſed JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS has declared unto us; and not be ſo Criminally <hi>unreaſonable</hi> as to ask for any further <hi>Demonstration. Speak, O Glorious LORD, and O thou True Witneſs, who art the Deliverer of Souls; we will hear all that thou ſhalt ſpeak unto us. Lord, We will Believe; Help thou our Unbelief!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt. Our SAVIOUR has aſſured us of this; <hi>The SOUL of Man dies not, when his Body dies.</hi> There are many Conſiderations, which render it more than probable, <hi>That the Soul of Man is an Immortal Spirit.</hi> The <hi>Appetites</hi> for <hi>Immortality,</hi> the <hi>Praeſages</hi> of <hi>Immortality,</hi> by GOD implanted in the <hi>Soul,</hi> cannot be <hi>made by Him in Vain.</hi> The <hi>Soul</hi> is not in its Conſtitution a <hi>periſhable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</hi> 'Tis evidently an <hi>Intellectual Being,</hi> of ſuch a Conſtitution as to have no <hi>Seeds of Corruption</hi> in it. The Soul ſo <hi>Differs</hi> from the <hi>Body,</hi> as to make us Think (and this very Thing, <hi>To Think,</hi> is more than
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001910_0019_0FB9D2D3B8D01CF8"/>
               <hi>Body</hi> can do!) that it <hi>Survives</hi> after the <hi>Death</hi> of the <hi>Body.</hi> Being <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and not Fleſh, therefore they ſhall not fail together.</hi> But above all, there is this to put the point beyond all <hi>Probability.</hi> The Glorious LORD, who is the Creator and Redeemer of our Soul, has poſitively told us, <hi>They which kill the Body are not able to kill the Soul.</hi> No profane ſhuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flings can Evade the force of this Proof! <hi>Man,</hi> Thy <hi>Soul,</hi> is a <hi>Candle of the Lord.</hi> Thy SAVIOUR who has placed this <hi>Lamp</hi> in the <hi>Earthen Veſſel,</hi> has affirmed unto thee, that it is not Extinguiſhed by the Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Earthen Veſſel.</hi> No, He will keep it in its Exiſtance to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Ages. The <hi>Spring</hi> in my Watch, will not be ſtript of its <hi>Elasticity,</hi> and ceaſe to be a <hi>Spring,</hi> when it ſhall be taken out of the <hi>Machine</hi> whereof it now cauſes the various <hi>Motions.</hi> Nor the <hi>Soul</hi> when ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the <hi>Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly. Our SAVIOUR has aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured us of this; <hi>That the Body which
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001910_0020_0FB9D2D9E85DD4F0"/>
is by Death parted from the Soul, ſhall by a Reſurrection from the Dead, be Restored unto it.</hi> It is not a <hi>Final</hi> and <hi>Endleſs</hi> parting of them, when the <hi>Dust returns to the Earth as it was,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit returns to GOD that gave it.</hi> No; The <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Soul,</hi> may ſay to one another at parting; <hi>We ſhall come together again.</hi> The Glorious LORD, who <hi>Rais'd His own Body from the Dead,</hi> has left us no Room to doubt of His <hi>Raiſing Ours,</hi> when He has peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily told us; Joh. V. 28, 29. <hi>The Hour is Coming, in the which, all that are in the Graves ſhall hear His Voice; And they ſhall come forth; They that have done good unto the Reſurrection of Life; and they that have done evil, unto the Reſurrection of Damnation.</hi> It is moſt certainly ſo! GOD In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate and Enthroned in our SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR will one Day Return from Heaven, and in that notable Day, <hi>according to the working of His Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Power, whereby He is able to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due all things unto Himſelf,</hi> He will
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001910_0021_0FB9D2DD586EA768"/>
fetch the <hi>Seeds</hi> of our diſſolved <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> from the Chambers of <hi>Death;</hi> He will <hi>Fill the Dead Bodies;</hi> He will return them to our <hi>Souls;</hi> to be Re-animated, with marvellous alterations upon them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly. Our SAVIOUR hath aſſured us of this; <hi>That after a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection from the Dead, the Wicked ſhall in Body as well as in Soul, be Puniſhed with very Deſtructive Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi> Be ſure, The <hi>Soul</hi> of a Wicked Man cannot but be very miſerable, from the Time of its going from the <hi>Body.</hi> 'Tis a <hi>Soul</hi> ſtript of all the <hi>Enjoyments,</hi> which it chuſes inſtead of the Glorious GOD, from whom it has wretchedly wandred; It is a <hi>Soul</hi> full of <hi>Remorſe</hi> for its paſt Follies, and full of <hi>Horror</hi> in the proſpect of a <hi>Wrath to come;</hi> It is a <hi>Soul,</hi> Abhorred by GOD, and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from GOD, and Aſſociated with <hi>Devils,</hi> which are <hi>Tormentors</hi> unto it. And, Oh! the <hi>Torments</hi> of it! Now, it cannot be ſuppoſed, that the <hi>Soul</hi> of a Wicked
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001910_0022_0FB9D2E3F74809E0"/>
Man, will have its Condition mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a <hi>Return</hi> to the <hi>Body.</hi> No; The Reſurrection of the <hi>D</hi>ead will be, upon that Intention; [For ſo it is to be read;] 2 Cor. V. 10 <hi>We must all appear before the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Seat of CHRIST, that every one may receive in the Body, according to what he hath done, whether Good or Bad.</hi> But, Oh! what will the <hi>Soul</hi> ſuffer in the <hi>Body,</hi> and what will the Raiſed <hi>Body</hi> ſuffer with and from the <hi>Soul,</hi> when GOD ſhall again unite them, on purpoſe to lay upon them the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> which belongs unto them! Syrs, Will you hearken to the <hi>Faithful ſayings of GOD!</hi> The <hi>Goſpel</hi> of our SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR, has given us all poſſible Aſſurance, <hi>That GOD has appointed a Day wherein He will Judge the World by Him;</hi> and <hi>That we ſhall all ſtand before the Judgment-Seat of CHRIST;</hi> and, <hi>That every one of us ſhall give an Account of himſelf unto GOD.</hi> The <hi>Goſpel</hi> of our SAVIOUR, has given us an undoubted Aſſurance, <hi>That
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001910_0023_0FB9D2E50AD6B438"/>
He will come to render unto all Men according to their works;</hi> and, <hi>That then the Wicked ſhall go away into an Everlaſting Puniſhment.</hi> The <hi>Goſpel</hi> of our SAVIOUR has given us a Repeted Aſſurance, That <hi>the Wicked ſhall be Puniſhed with an Everlasting Destruction from the Preſence of the Lord, and from the Glory of His Power;</hi> and, <hi>That the Angels ſhall come forth and cast them into a Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace of Fire; where ſhall be wailing and gnaſhing of Teeth.</hi> After this <hi>Goſpel,</hi> there is no room for any <hi>Diſquiſition.</hi> The <hi>Goſpel</hi> ſpeaks theſe things; There is no want of any further <hi>Demonstration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. Twice has the <hi>Trumpet</hi> ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; The ſound muſt wax <hi>Louder and Louder. Behold, the Third</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation of <hi>Wo</hi> unto the Wicked, now <hi>cometh quickly!</hi> You are to be now informed, That no <hi>Death</hi> can be ſo <hi>Formidable</hi> as the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> of Sin in <hi>Deſtructive Miſeries</hi> upon the <hi>Soul</hi> as well as the <hi>Body</hi> of the Sinner, in the HELL that is
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001910_0024_0FB9D2E69E6DEEA8"/>
to come after <hi>Death.</hi> Unto this Amazing <hi>Puniſhment,</hi> the Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation given is that, Rev. XX. 14. <hi>This is the Second Death.</hi> But veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, There is nothing in the <hi>First Death,</hi> which may be compared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Destructive Miſeries</hi> in that <hi>Second Death.</hi> DEATH is the <hi>King of Terrors;</hi> But in compariſon of the <hi>Second Death,</hi> it is but a <hi>Shadow of Death;</hi> It has no <hi>Terrors</hi> compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to thoſe of the <hi>Second Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Unto this tremendous Aſſertion, there has been a mighty <hi>Army of Martyrs</hi> who have born a <hi>Testimony,</hi> which ought to be far from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible with us. Come with me, to <hi>Mahanaim,</hi> and ſee the <hi>Hosts of GOD,</hi> and hear their <hi>Testimony.</hi> There have been Thouſands of good and wiſe Men, who rather than Sin againſt the Glorious GOD have <hi>not loved their Lives unto the Death;</hi> but been willing to Dye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Term to which in the courſe of Nature they might have <hi>lived.</hi> When theſe Men were put
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001910_0025_0FB9D2E8644D80B8"/>
in mind of this thing, <hi>Death is Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> One of them ſpoke the mind of all the reſt, when he ſaid, <hi>But HELL is more Bitter than any Death! Death</hi> in all the moſt hideous and horrible <hi>Forms</hi> of it, and with all the moſt Inſufferable <hi>Tortures,</hi> has been ſet before them. This <hi>Death</hi> have they choſen, and unto all the Torturous Cruelties which that Curſed Monſter <hi>Perſecution</hi> could afflict them withal, have they Courageouſly and Cheerfully Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed themſelves. Why, They have all ſaid, <hi>No Death of the Body from the Hand of Man can be ſo formidable, as the Deſtruction of Soul as well as Body from the Hand of GOD, after Death, unto which our Sin againſt GOD would render us obnoxious.</hi> The Servants of GOD, who have ſuffered <hi>Martyrdom</hi> have been the <hi>Excellent of the Earth;</hi> and ſuch a <hi>Spirit of GOD has reſted on them,</hi> in their ſufferings, that we cannot reaſonably imagine them left unto a <hi>Deluſion,</hi> in the Grand Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:001910_0026_0FB9D2ECCFCE2480"/>
that acted them. Theſe <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> of GOD, <hi>aſcending up into Heaven in a Cloud,</hi> call with a Loud Voice from thence unto us; <hi>It was well worth all our Sufferings, to eſcape the Destructive Miſeries of the Hell, from which we are now delivered!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What will be the more <hi>ſpecial kinds</hi> of the <hi>Destructive miſeries</hi> in the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> of the Damned in HELL; This is a Thing very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from us, as well as the more particular place of Torment. Our <hi>Saxon</hi> Word, HELL, ſignifies, <hi>a Pit,</hi> and one that is <hi>covered over.</hi> Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, our Language wants Words to expreſs the <hi>Destructive Miſeries</hi> in that <hi>Pit of Destruction,</hi> and ſo it can be no other than very much <hi>covered over.</hi> And yet the <hi>Mouth</hi> of the <hi>Pit</hi> has been ſo much <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered</hi> unto us that we ſhall not fall into it, except with <hi>madneſs in our Heart while we live,</hi> we will <hi>go unto the Dead.</hi> You ſhall preſently ſee the <hi>Mouth</hi> of the <hi>Pit</hi> opened, and the <hi>Smoak of the Torment</hi> come
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001910_0027_0FB9D2EFDB8B8F38"/>
up, which is to <hi>aſcend for ever and ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Name which our SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR uſes for the HELL wherein <hi>GOD will deſtroy both Soul and Body</hi> of the Wicked, even, GEHENNA; This carries in it, what is very <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable.</hi> 'Tis as much as to ſay, <hi>The Valley of Hinnom.</hi> Tragical Things were done in <hi>the Valley of Hinnom,</hi> when the Diabolical Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters offered up their Children to <hi>Molock</hi> there; and employed the Noiſe of Drums to drown the dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Cry of the Infants while they were <hi>Burning Alive</hi> unto the Devil. It ſeems, the Ejulations of wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches <hi>Burning Alive,</hi> [But, <hi>O Lord, How Long! How Long!</hi>] Theſe, it ſeems, will give ſome <hi>Idea</hi> of the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> inflicted on the <hi>multitudes,</hi> alas, the <hi>multitudes!</hi>—in the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal <hi>Valley of Destruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, you look for <hi>Demonſtrations.</hi> I affirm to you, No <hi>Death</hi> ſo For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable, as the <hi>Destructive Miſeries</hi> of that HELL, wherein the <hi>wicked</hi>

We have ſeen HELL begun upon <hi>Earth;</hi> And from thence we may gather, how <hi>Formidable,</hi> and much more painful than any <hi>Death,</hi> will be the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> of the Wicked, in that HELL to which they are going down. If the <hi>Raiſed Bodies</hi> of the Wicked, muſt feel <hi>Pains</hi> at leaſt <hi>Equal</hi> to what they gave unto the <hi>Bodies</hi> of others here, and be uſed no better than ſome <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane Caribbaeans</hi> do their <hi>Slaves,</hi> they will now be worſe of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their <hi>Souls</hi> will feel, what the <hi>ſufferers</hi> from them here, did not undergo. The Horrors raiſed in a <hi>Guilty Conſcience,</hi> what are they but ſome ſparkles of HELL ſhot into the Souls of Men? But theſe Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, How Intolerable! How Into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable! It was long ſince obſerved; Prov. XVIII. 14. <hi>A wounded Spirit, who can bear?</hi> Perſons under the Horrors of a <hi>Guilty Conſcience,</hi> how <hi>Formidably</hi> are they Cruciated? They <hi>Roar by Reaſon of the Diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

Some that have wounded their <hi>Conſcience</hi> by ſinful Compliances and Apoſtaſies, have been ſo unable to bear the <hi>Wounds,</hi> that they have Retracted what they have done, and have gone and have told, the <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors, No Death you can inflict, is a thouſandth part ſo bad, as the wounds which we feel in our Souls!</hi> Yea, How often have People under the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of a <hi>Guilty Conſcience,</hi> grown lean, and pale, and ghaſtly; and been meer <hi>Magor-Miſſabib's,</hi> a <hi>Terror</hi> to <hi>themſelves, and all about them!</hi> How often, have they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd, That <hi>Burning in the Fire</hi> on the <hi>Hearth,</hi> would be a <hi>Mitigation of their Miſeries!</hi> One of them over hearing People ſpeak, about <hi>Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Fire,</hi> cried out, <hi>Oh!

<pb n="30" facs="unknown:001910_0032_0FB9D2FEEAE4F8E8"/>
Horrors of a <hi>Guilty Conſcience</hi> do ſeize upon the <hi>Souls</hi> of the wicked, in the fulleſt Efficacy, and with a vaſt Enlargement of their <hi>Faculties,</hi> to receive the laſhes of the <hi>Furies.</hi> GOD has an <hi>Inſtrument of His Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance</hi> in the <hi>Conſcience</hi> of a Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Man. And Oh! the Scourges, Oh! the Scorches, which it will give unto him, when the <hi>Vengeance of Eternal Fire</hi> falls upon him! Can any <hi>Death</hi> be ſo <hi>Formidable,</hi> as what is felt from a <hi>Conſcience</hi> arm'd with <hi>Guilt,</hi> and in the Name of the Holy GOD upbraiding a Sinner with a <hi>Fiery Indignation?</hi>

            <p>As an Appendix unto this Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, I will offer to your View, the aſtoniſhing Diſtreſs into which our Bleſſed JESUS Himſelf was thrown, when <hi>GOD laid upon him the Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of us all,</hi> and He underwent the <hi>Puniſhment,</hi> which was due for the Sins of His Elect.

<pb n="31" facs="unknown:001910_0033_0FB9D300039FEEC8"/>

               <hi>Oh!

            <p>Thirdly. The <hi>Puniſhment</hi> of the Wicked in the <hi>HELL ordained of old by the King</hi> of Heaven for them; From whence will come the <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:001910_0034_0FB9D302423F7C38"/>
Infliction</hi> of it? O Hearken to me! The <hi>Principal Infliction</hi> of the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> on the Damned, will be with an <hi>Immediate Impreſſion</hi> from the wrath of an Infinite GOD upon the <hi>Soul</hi> that is fixed in an Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for Him. O moſt <hi>Formidable Puniſhment!</hi> At the mention of it, will not our <hi>Souls</hi> Tremble, and our <hi>Hearts be removed out of their place?</hi> The <hi>Puniſhment</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi> in <hi>HELL,</hi> will be nothing leſs than the <hi>Wrath</hi> of an Almighty GOD, making a direful Impreſſion on the <hi>Soul</hi> of the Sinner. The Sinner ſhall not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered over into the Hands of only <hi>Finite Executioners:</hi> But the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty GOD Himſelf, will take him into His own Hands, and make him feel ſuch ſcalding ſtrokes of His <hi>Wrath,</hi> as will be more torturous than flaming Sulphur, or than run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Bell-Metal. What will be the <hi>Fire</hi> of the Damned? There is an awful Intimation; Heb. XII. 29. <hi>Our God is a conſuming Fire.</hi> Oh! 'Tis GOD approaching to them, as

The great GOD Himſelf will ſhoot the Thunder of His <hi>Wrath</hi> into the Deſolate Soul of the Sinner; GOD with His burning Wrath ſhall draw near to the Deſolate Soul, and fill it with a Confuſion that no words can deſcribe unto them who are yet in the Fleſh. <hi>Lord, Thou wilt make them as a Fiery Oven in the Time of thine Anger!</hi> The <hi>Lord will ſwallow them up with His wrath;</hi> ſo the <hi>Fire ſhall devour them.

<pb n="34" facs="unknown:001910_0036_0FB9D3072BDD5EC0"/>
the <hi>Soul</hi> of the Sinner; the <hi>Poiſon</hi> thereof, Oh! how it ſhall Enflame and Enrage the <hi>Spirit!</hi> Oh! The Groans of the Malefactor, when the <hi>Wrath</hi> of GOD ſhall be breaking of him; <hi>O GOD, Thy-Wrath lies hard upon me; Thy Fierce Wrath, O GOD, is going over me!</hi> Can any <hi>Death</hi> be ſo <hi>Formidable? Can thy Heart En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, or thy Hands be ſtrong, when I ſhall deal with thee? ſaith the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally. There is this to render the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> of the Wicked in HELL beyond all Imagination <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable.</hi> Do you know of any <hi>Period</hi> for the <hi>Puniſhment?</hi> Only an <hi>Aking Tooth,</hi> holding One for a <hi>Month</hi> together, how grievous! But the Exquiſite <hi>Miſeries</hi> of the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, will they hold no more than a year? or will they come to a <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod</hi> in a <hi>Thouſand years?</hi> or after as many Millions of years, as there are <hi>Leaves</hi> upon the Trees, or <hi>Drops</hi> in the Sea, or <hi>Sands</hi> on the Shore; will they then come to a <hi>Period?</hi> or, could a Scroul as wide as the

Syſtem of Our World, fill'd with Figures, contain the Number of years, which the Wicked are to ſee <hi>paſſing away in the Wrath of GOD!</hi> We know nothing of any <hi>Period.</hi> This we know, That our SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR has called it, Mat.

               </gap>. <hi>An Everlaſting Puniſhment.</hi> And there is a conſideration, which the mind of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> cannot hear propoſed, but he muſt like <hi>Moſes</hi> before the Burning Mountain of old, cry out, <hi>I exceedingly fear and quake, at the mention of it!</hi> It is this; 'Tis plain, That our <hi>Mediator</hi> unto whom <hi>GOD has committed the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> will adjudge the Wicked un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>Puniſhment</hi> which will be <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable.</hi> 'Tis plain, That our <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator</hi> at the <hi>Time of the End,</hi> when <hi>He delivers up his Kingdom to His Father,</hi> Leaves the Wicked ſtill under their <hi>Puniſhment.</hi> If ever the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed be Releaſed from their <hi>Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> it muſt be after the <hi>Son of GOD,</hi> ſhall ceaſe to act as a <hi>Mediator.</hi> Now, when the <hi>Mediator</hi> has left

them, in the <hi>Devouring Fire, and in the Everlasting Burnings,</hi> Who, who will there be to bring them out? Or, Is there any likelihood, that Souls, which have outſtood their <hi>Time for Probation,</hi> and are fixed in all <hi>Malignity,</hi> ſhould ever be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and brought back unto an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable GOD, who has finally Rejected them? O <hi>Puniſhment</hi> hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of a <hi>Period?</hi> Certainly, No <hi>Death</hi> can be ſo <hi>Formidable?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IV. But <hi>All have Sinned!</hi> And What? Is there <hi>no Remedy nor Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caping?</hi> Yes, my Friends; <hi>I bring you good Tidings of great Joy!</hi> An Improvement is now to be made of theſe <hi>Faithful ſayings:</hi> Which are alſo how <hi>Fearful</hi> ones! The FEAR of GOD, is now to be praeſcribed unto you, as the only Method of your <hi>Deliverance</hi> from the <hi>Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Miſeries</hi> which the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> Of <hi>Sin</hi> is big withal. Every One will take it for granted, That the GOD who is <hi>Able to Destroy both Soul and Body in Hell,</hi> is a GOD for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:001910_0039_0FB9D30F140D8798"/>
to be <hi>Feared. Who ſhall not Fear thee, O Lord, and Glorify thy Name?</hi> Certainly, A ſorry <hi>Worm</hi> crawling upon the Earth, urging us to Sin againſt Him, cannot be ſo worthy to be <hi>Feared,</hi> as He. Think of this, O all you, whom the <hi>Fear of Man,</hi> may be likely to draw in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any <hi>Snare of Sin.</hi> But I am now to adviſe you, That if you would be delivered from the <hi>Destruction of both Soul and Body in Hell,</hi> it muſt be by the <hi>Fear of GOD.</hi> So we are inſtructed, Prov. XIV. 27. <hi>The Fear of the Lord is a Fountain of Life, to depart from the Snares of Death.</hi> O our <hi>Goſpellized People;</hi> You muſt come into the <hi>Fear of GOD</hi> Immediately, if you would not be <hi>destroy'd both Soul and Body in Hell,</hi> and if you would not <hi>periſh wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully!</hi> We may juſtly make that Exclamation once made by the Man of GOD; Lord, <hi>Who ſo conſiders as to know what Power thy Anger has! Yea, ev'n according to thy Fear ſo is thy flaming Wrath.</hi> Souls, <hi>According</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:001910_0040_0FB9D3125ED4D280"/>
as the <hi>Fear of GOD</hi> is in you or not, ſo ſhall the <hi>Wrath of GOD</hi> be diſpenſed unto you. You are on every ſide ſurrounded with <hi>perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſives</hi> to the <hi>Fear of GOD, perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſives</hi> Enough to render your <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction</hi> as Demerited as Unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if you continue the <hi>Children of Unperſwadableneſs.</hi> But what is now inſiſted on is this; Oh! may you now be <hi>perſwaded</hi> unto it, <hi>Knowing the Terror of the Lord.</hi> Come into the <hi>Fear</hi> of GOD, moved by this, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction from GOD, is a Terror to me!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are Three Things to be more particularly in the <hi>Fear of GOD,</hi> now preſs'd upon you.</p>
            <p>Firſt. In the <hi>Fear of GOD,</hi> make your <hi>Flight</hi> unto your only SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR, that you may be delivered from the <hi>Wrath of GOD</hi> and from the <hi>Destructive Miſeries</hi> in that HELL which your <hi>Sin,</hi> has deſerved for you. This, This is the <hi>Fear of GOD,</hi> in the Evangelical Notion of it; Such a <hi>Dread</hi> of the Divine Diſpleaſure whereto our Sin Expoſes us, as to Compel our <hi>Flight</hi> unto the only
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:001910_0041_0FB9D31493470348"/>
SAVIOUR from <hi>Sin,</hi> that by Him we may be <hi>Saved</hi> from it, Thus we read, Pſal. CXLVII. 11. <hi>The Lord takes pleaſure in them that Fear Him, in them that hope in His Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</hi> Our <hi>Hope</hi> in a Glorious CHRIST, is our <hi>Hope</hi> in the <hi>Mercy</hi> of GOD. Without this <hi>Hope,</hi> there is no Genuine <hi>Fear of GOD.</hi> O People in Danger of a <hi>Damnation that ſlumbers not;</hi> You are to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, That there is a <hi>JESUS who delivers from the Wrath to come.</hi> You are to Remember, That we have a Great SAVIOUR who has willingly undergone the <hi>Eſſentials</hi> of that <hi>Puniſhment</hi> which was due to His choſen for their <hi>Sin.</hi> You are to Remember, That when the Blood of our Great SAVIOUR is applied unto his choſen, to reſcue them from their <hi>Puniſhment,</hi> He always inclines and ſtrengthens them, to <hi>Confeſs</hi> and <hi>Forſake</hi> their Sin, and Return unto GOD. Now, you muſt in the <hi>Fear of GOD,</hi> fall down before your Great SAVIOUR,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:001910_0042_0FB9D315C4050D80"/>
and with a wondrous Importunity beg it of Him; <hi>O my SAVIOUR, Do thou Reconcile me, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> GOD, and Lead me in the Paths of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> My Friend, Except thou doſt <hi>Wrestle</hi> hard for this, and as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes an <hi>Iſraelite indeed, Weep and make Supplication</hi> to GOD for it, thou never ſhalt be <hi>Justified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly. The <hi>Fear of GOD,</hi> when 'tis wrought in a Soul, there is the <hi>Life of GOD</hi> begun in that Soul. O make out for, O make ſure of, ſuch a <hi>Vital Touch</hi> from GOD upon your minds, as will <hi>Quicken</hi> you to <hi>live</hi> unto Him. Theſe always go together; Eccl. XII. 13 <hi>Fear GOD and keep His Commandments.</hi> The <hi>Fear of GOD</hi> infuſed into the <hi>Heart,</hi> will make a <hi>New Heart</hi> of it, and a clean One. Oh! Let that cry aſcend from you with a matchleſs Agony, <hi>Create in me a Clean Heart, O GOD! The Fear of GOD,</hi> will diſpoſe you to be afraid of every Thing which the <hi>Light of GOD</hi> within you, ſhall
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:001910_0043_0FB9D317312BCC90"/>
pronounce a ſinful Thing. It will diſpoſe you, to fill your Lives with continual <hi>Acknowledgments</hi> of GOD, and make it your main Deſign, to <hi>pleaſe</hi> Him, your main Buſineſs to <hi>Serve</hi> Him, and <hi>Acknowledge Him in all your ways.</hi> It will diſpoſe you, to acquieſce in the <hi>Will</hi> of GOD, and behave your ſelves as under the <hi>Eye</hi> of God, and as thoſe who muſt give unto Him an <hi>Account</hi> of your Behaviour. It will diſpoſe you to follow the pattern of your SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR, and rejoyce in an <hi>Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Him, a <hi>Conformity</hi> to Him. It will diſpoſe you to <hi>Love</hi> your <hi>Neighbour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and ſtill <hi>do to him,</hi> as you would own it Right for him to <hi>do unto you.</hi> Without theſe <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,</hi> you cannot look for Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into thoſe <hi>Gates,</hi> which are ſet open for none but the <hi>Righteous Nation.</hi> If you cannot ſhew ſuch <hi>Tokens of Salvation,</hi> you ſhall never be received unto the <hi>Feast</hi> in the mount of GOD. Should a Soul without theſe <hi>Diſpoſitions</hi> be taken
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:001910_0044_0FB9D31E575E0E40"/>
into Heaven, that <hi>Holy Place</hi> would ſoon purge it out, clear it ſelf of ſo diſagreeable a Nuſance. Wretched Soul, <hi>Heaven</hi> is a Soyl, that cannot bear ſuch a venemous <hi>

                  </gap>
               </hi> in it. A Soul that has theſe <hi>Diſpoſitions</hi> wro't in it, has <hi>Heaven</hi> it ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought into the very Temper of it; and if it were poſſible for ſuch a <hi>Sanctified Soul</hi> to be thrown down into HELL, it would carry <hi>Heaven</hi> thither with it. Now, <hi>If any of you lack this wiſdom let him ask it of GOD!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly. Take the Warnings of DYING MEN, againſt thoſe <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions of the Wicked,</hi> which may <hi>ſay within our Heart, There is no Fear of GOD before the Eyes</hi> of thoſe who practiſe them. To <hi>Fear GOD,</hi> and <hi>

               </gap> a more full Declaration of his Dying Sentiments.</head>
            <p>I Conſider my ſelf as a dying Man, and I deſire to dye giving Glory to God, before whom I am now to make my Appearance. I offer up my Praiſes unto God who has granted me ſuch a ſpace of Repentance, and ſo many helps and means to bring me to it.</p>
            <p>I hope, the Faithful Servants of God, will with ſome comfort ſee

ſome Harveſt of the great pains they have taken for my Good.</p>
            <p>To all the other Sins of a Wicked Life, I have added this; That I have too much delayed my Repentance, even ſince my Impriſonment, while the Sentence againſt my evil work, was not yet certain to be Executed. Though I have hereby ſo affronted and provoked the good Spirit of Grace, that He might juſtly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw for ever from me, yet ſuch has been his Free and Rich Grace, as to continue ſtill to viſit me with his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences; and bring on a work of Repentance in my Soul.</p>
            <p>I heartily mourn for all the Sins of my Life; and above all for the Fountain of all Sins, which I have in an Heart that is deſperately wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I moſt particularly confeſs and bewail my Blood-Guiltineſs. I owe my Life to Juſtice, for having wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully taken away the Life of my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whom I ought to have loved as my ſelf. I own the Juſtice of the Government in their Proceeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me. <hi>But, Lord, there is For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs with thee, that thou mayeſt be feared.</hi>

I behold the Infinite Mercy of a God ready to Pardon; and my Soul is amazed at it: I behold a great Saviour, ſhedding his Blood, which cleanſes from all Sin. And I hear him ſaying to the chief of Sinners, <hi>Him that cometh unto me I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> With a diſtreſſed Soul I fly to him, to be reconciled unto God, and to be led into Paths of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. I am not without Hope. And one fruit of my Hope, is, that it cauſes me to look on my Sins with more Sorrow for them, and Hatred of them; which till I had this Hope, I did not care or dare to think upon. Another fruit of it, is, that my Heart is melted, and filled with Deſires to Glorify God:</p>
            <p>And I know not how to glorify God more, than by ſolemn warnings unto all People to take heed of ſuch Sins, as have brought me to ſuch a Ruin as is now come upon me.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing that lies heavy on my Heart is, My Prophanation of the Lords Day, and my frequently &amp; needleſly neglecting the Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God. A Sin, which let all that love their Souls be afraid of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

I have wounded my Soul ſometimes by exceſſive Drinking. A Sin that leads to many others. I have been very vile in Swearing and Curſing. <hi>Lord, ſend me not among thoſe whoſe Language I have been uſed unto!</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governed Anger has brought my Death. Beware, my Friends, of this deadly Evil. But I would eſpecially bewail my Prayerleſs Life. I had no Prayers with my Family, nor in my Retirement, in the Morning of the Day, when I was left unto the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of my Neighbour. O my Friends, In the Day, which you don't begin with Prayers unto God, little do you know what God may leave you to.</p>
            <p>Thus, I would as in the Preſence of God, and as I am now in a ſhort Time to appear before my great Judge, there to give up an Account of my Actions done in the Fleſh, ſolemnly exhort and warn all that ſhall ſee or hear of my Tragical and Untimely End; But more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Maſters of Families, that they do not neglect Prayers in their Families, and a due Attendance on the Publick Worſhip of God, on his Holy Day,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001910_0056_0FB9D3432C6514F0"/>
and all other, Duties required in Gods Holy Word, as I to my great Grief have done. I deſire all, that they look back on their paſt life, and ſeek to God, thorough Jeſus Chriſt for Repentance, while there is a ſpace given to them, leaſt they mourn at laſt, and ſay, <hi>how have I hated In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction?</hi> and leaſt God in His Holy Juſtice ſhould ſay to them, <hi>when I called upon you, you would not hear, now you cry to me, I will not anſwer you.</hi> I deſire yet more eſpecially, to warn all young Perſons, to ſeek un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God in their Youth and in the Morning of their Days, as believing that their whole Life is but a ſhort Time to prepare for Eternity; and to live in an holy walk with God, leſt they ſhould provoke God to leave them to fall into the ſame Sins which have been my Ruin. Pray, let my Advice to you never be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by you, but take Example from me; take it as the words of a dying Friend and Neighbour, that you may not run on in ſinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the bleſſed God, but that you may take warning by me, and may hearken to the Calls of God in the
