            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>IT is a point eſtabliſhed by the reaſon of mankind, and by the divine authority of the holy ſcriptures, that the glory of God is his ultimate end in all his works, of creation, providence, and grace. No higher end can poſſibly be propoſed, and all reaſonable beings muſt be allowed to act upon the higheſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and moſt exalted views. God is the firſt cauſe and laſt end of all things.</p>
            <p>And as his glory is his end in all his works, ſo he is ſure never to be baffled in his deſigns, nor fruſtrated in any of his means deviſed for his own glory. His wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom counterplots, and his power controuls, all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of men or devils, and maketh their wrath to praiſe him.—A remarkable inſtance in mankind—Sinners. Our firſt father ſinned, and came ſhort of the glory of God; loſt the moral image and favour of God; and it ſeemed as if God had made mankind in vain. But <hi>O the depth of the riches both of the wiſdom and knowledge of God!</hi> Man's apoſtacy is God's opportunity to declare his glory, and ſhew the exceeding riches of wiſdom and grace.—Divine mercy hitherto hid in God from angels and men, now appears to both; free abundant mercy and divine pity to the miſerable. Now ſhall mercy be built up forever, and God will declare his righteouſneſs, in the remiſſion of ſin, by the great propitiation, and through the tender mercies of our God. Yea, God will
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:011299_0003_0F869F6DB7DD29A8"/>
exalt himſelf in all the diſplays of unmerited grace, and ſhew forth the glory of holineſs, in a conſiſtency with mercy to ſinners, maintain and vindicate the honor of truth, and magnify the law and make it honourable, and ſhew himſelf a God in his pardoning mercy, and all without the leaſt wrong to his name and honour; yea, with the moſt perfect harmony of all his moral attributes, in our redemption by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>A thread of juſtice runs through the whole web of his adminiſtrations. Juſtice and judgment are the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation (or baſis) of his throne. A God of truth, and without iniquity: His tender mercies are over all his work <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> and truth are interwoven in the whole plan of our redemption, cordially unite in all the works of regenerating grace, and are manifeſt in all the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of divine providence towards his people.</p>
            <p>And all that, by efficacious grace, are made partakers of the divine nature in its glorious properties, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in knowledge, righteouſneſs, and true holineſs, have in theſe a reſemblance to God, they are holy as God is holy, merciful as their Father which is in heaven is merciful; true and faithful, doing juſtice, loving mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and walking humbly with their God; are imitators of God as dear children, being influenced by mercy and truth, in all their conduct in the world. And, as they have experienced the divine power of truth and mercy, they are ſanctified through the truth, and clean through the word that Chriſt hath ſpoken; have an heart of fleſh; being tender-hearted, of a compaſſionate and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving temper; and under the divine influence of mercy and truth, they go on cleanſing themſelves from all filthineſs, both of fleſh and ſpirit, until they finiſh their ſanctification in the fear of the Lord. God will ſend forth his mercy and his truth to preſerve them, and more and more purify their hearts by faith, till their iniquities ſhall be ſought for and not be found. For as for their tranſgreſſions God will fully purge them away in the blood of the Lamb, who appeared to take away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:011299_0004_0F869F6E78E5A4B0"/>Theſe happily furniſh them with the meekneſs of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that wiſdom which is from above, which is firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle, and eaſy to be entreated, full of mercies and good fruits; whereby to deal prudently, in all their endeavours for a reformation, in the land, in the churches, or in their own families.</p>
            <p>We propoſe to give the text it's full ſcope and latitude, ſhewing how God by mercy and truth purges iniquity; then how we are to be herein imitators of God.</p>
            <p>God purges iniquity by mercy and truth in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, in regeneration, and in his providential diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations. Mercy and truth unite in the whole ſcheme of our redemption, and in every line of the goſpel cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. They both meet in the perſon of Chriſt. He is a <hi>merciful and faithful high-prieſt, in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the ſins of his people:</hi> Merciful to men, and ever faithful to his Father, ſaved the honour of divine truth, law, and juſtice; and opened a way for mercy to be diſplayed, to the glory of all the other moral attributes of God. <hi>Grace and truth</hi> both <hi>came by Jeſus Chriſt</hi>; and mercy is built up forever; and truth, or the covenant faithfulneſs of God, eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the very heavens. All his divine love and pity, in which he redeemed us, never moved him to diſcharge one guilty ſoul, otherwiſe than as ſatisfaction be made for his offences. So he indented with the traitor: <hi>If ye ſeek me, let theſe go their way,</hi> q. d. juſtice requires not double payment. If the ſurety be arreſted and pay their debt, let them be diſcharged. All the ſounding of his bowels and mercies never prompted him to give up the honour of truth and juſtice. All his conduct on earth evinces that he was faithful to his Father, as well as merciful to mankind—ſinners. <hi>Faithful to him that appointed him, as a ſon over his own houſe</hi>: as the <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and true witneſs, he bare witneſs unto the truth,</hi> and at laſt ſealed it with his blood; yet ſhewed all that tender pity to men, conſiſtent with unſhaken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in the truth. And though he knew well that
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011299_0005_0F869F6F80784510"/>
God was gracious and merciful, ſlow unto anger, forgiving iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſin, yet he never made the leaſt motion to have him clear the guilty, by any means ſhort of full ſatisfaction; and thus ſubmitted to drink the bitter cup: <hi>Father glorify thy name; thy will be done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mercy and truth are conſpicuous in his death. Mercy beyond expreſſion; a love ſtronger than death, which all the waters of afflictions could not quench, nor all the floods of ungodly men drown. A love paſſing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. He loved the church and gave himſelf for it. His ſacred regard to truth runs parallel with his dying love. Let me die the moſt ſhameful, bitter, and accurſed death of the croſs, rather than that divine truth be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, or the rights of juſtice in the leaſt infringed. The ſurety ſuffers. There is no abatement. Truth is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable. The ſoul that ſins ſhall die, and if one died for all, then all have died * in their ſurety; and God is a juſt God, and a Saviour: juſt, and yet juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ungodly: and his truth endureth throughout all generations.</p>
            <p>Mercy and truth are happily united in all the great and precious promiſes in Chriſt, which are yea, and in him amen, to the glory of God. Mercy in promiſing and truth in performing. God helps his ſervants, as ever mindful of his covenant, and in remembrance of his own mercy. God that cannot lie hath promiſed. His mercy promiſed to the poſterity of Abraham the old Canaan, his truth performed it, ſo that there failed not ought of all the good he had promiſed to Iſrael, ſo all the new covenant promiſes of pardon of ſin, of grace and glory, are from mercy; and all theſe words of grace are forever ſettled in heaven, and God hath magnified his word above all his name, making it a ſpecial point of his divine honour, to be as good as his word. And truth, as well as grace, will appear glorious indeed, when God has accompliſhed his whole work on mount Zion, and it ſhall appear, that there hath not failed ought of all that good promiſed to his true Iſrael, in all the ſacred volumes of the gracious covenant.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:011299_0006_0F869F6FF5C171B0"/>By mercy and truth God purges iniquity in regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Theſe by the divine ſpirit, taking hold of us, purge away our ſinful inclinations. By mercy wrought on us, and having a ſanctifying influence upon us, iniquity is purged away.</p>
            <p>Truth firſt takes hold of the conſcience of the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate ſinner. He is convinced by the law as a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor. And he is obliged to own, that the law, by which he is condemned, is <hi>holy, juſt and good. By the law is the knowledge of ſin. Thro' the law,</hi> he becomes <hi>dead to the law,</hi> and ſees nothing but deſtruction before him, he ſees no poſſible way for mercy to be diſplayed. But God from the throne of grace, ſhews the riches of abundant mercy, and a way to diſplay that mercy thro' the Son of his love, conſiſtent with truth and juſtice: the ſoul is then bowed to truth, and falls before the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy-ſeat, ſprinkled with blood; approves juſtice and truth in the law of God; and how ſweet is divine mercy ſtreaming in the blood of atonement! he accepts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption thro' his blood, the forgiveneſs of ſins, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the riches of his grace; and ſees ſomething of the divine wiſdom and prudence, in adjuſting matters ſo, for our ſalvation, as that the riches of grace are the more glorious, for flowing to ſinners thro' the bleeding veins of a crucified Redeemer. Hence a change in the nature. Free mercy melts the ſoul to unfeigned repentance; to become merciful and forgiving to all but himſelf. At the ſame time to reverence the truth, and adore the juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and love the law of God, becauſe it is pure. Thus are we made partakers of the divine nature, and eſcape the corruption that is in the world.</p>
            <p>They, that being ignorant of God's righteouſneſs, and going about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, and have not ſubmitted to the righteouſneſs of God, do not unite mercy and truth, but truſt to truth in a miſtaken ſenſe, without mercy. And ſecure ſinners that preſume, becauſe God is merciful, they ſhall not be damned; do truſt to mercy in direct contradiction to truth. They ſee
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:011299_0007_0F869F753B5BA208"/>
not that mercy is holy. And neither of theſe have any juſt notion of divine mercy or truth. But all that, under a work of the Holy Spirit, have theſe united in their hearts, are in a meaſure ſanctified thro' the truth, have their hearts turned to hate ſin, and love holineſs; to do juſtice, love mercy, and walk humbly with God. Their faith worketh by love to God, and all mankind. They have that charity that hopeth all things, that rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth. And while they love, not only ſaints, with a pure heart, for the truth's ſake that is in them, and all mankind in general, with a tender, ingenuous benevolence, and even their moſt malignant enemies; they cannot endure that which is evil; but hate their work that turn aſide; it ſhall not cleave to them. Yet, ever tender to other perſons, and are willing to cover a multitude of ſins in them, if it may be conſiſtent with truth and juſtice.</p>
            <p>Thus Joſeph, the reputed father of our Lord, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mary his eſpouſed wife with child, and not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be by the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>being a juſt man, was minded to put her away privily,</hi> and not make her a public example, or expoſe her to death as an adultreſs. His very juſtice, tempered with mercy, engaged him to conceal the private eſpouſals, that ſhe might ſuffer no more, than for ſimple fornication.</p>
            <p>Being convinced of their own tranſgreſſions, how they have exceeded: and being melted, with that great mercy, which has forgiven them ten thouſand talents, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered their ſouls from the loweſt hell; they learn to have compaſſion on their fellow ſervants, even, as the Lord has had pity on them. And all the perſonal wrongs and injuries, they may receive from their fellow creatures, appear to them ſcarce an hundred pence, compared with their wrongs to God; and which they now can readily forgive. Their ſins and ingratitude to God, their ſins againſt heaven and in his ſight, appear ſo great, that the wrongs of men, to them, appear as nothing.</p>

               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:011299_0008_0F869F75F7463908"/>Thus David could hear, without any conſiderable reſentment, all the cruel curſing of an abandoned Shimei. <hi>Behold!</hi> (ſays he) <hi>my ſon which came forth of my bowels ſeeketh my life, and how much more may this Benjamite do it!</hi> Chriſt has been broken with my whoriſh heart, how much more may my heart be broken with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of men! <hi>Father, forgive them, they know not what they do. Lay not ſin to their charge.</hi> Theſe have truth in their inward parts; and <hi>bleſſed are theſe merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, for they ſhall obtain mercy.</hi> They forgive men their treſpaſſes and their heavenly father will alſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them. That iniquity, which uſed to harden the heart againſt God and men, is now in a meaſure purged away, and theſe Iſraelites indeed, in whom is no allowed guile, ſhall finally be redeemed, with all God's true Iſrael, from all their iniquities.</p>
            <p>By mercy and truth God purges iniquity in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential diſpenſations towards his people. He purges his floor and refines his people, not only by his word and ſpirit, but by the mixt diſpenſations of providence, calling them to ſing of mercy and judgment: viſits in wrath, and in that <hi>wrath remembers mercy; ſtays his rough wind in the day of his eaſtwind; and by this ſhall the iniquity of Jacob be purged, and this is all the fruit to take away ſin.</hi> God doth not mete out a cup of naked inexorable juſtice to them, without a mixture of mercy; nor yet of mercy, without truth and juſtice; but ſends forth both mercy and truth to preſerve them. Thus in wrath he viſited Iſrael in the wilderneſs; <hi>but being full of compaſſion, forgave their iniquity, and deſtroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not ſtir up all his wrath. For he remembered that they were fleſh</hi>: He is a God that <hi>forgave them, though he took vengeance on their</hi> ſinful <hi>inventions.</hi> God anſwers the prayers of his people, and gives them what they need; but not without ſome <hi>terrible things in righteouſneſs,</hi> to ſtrike an awe upon them. He corrects them, but it is in <hi>judgment,</hi> and a merciful mitigation, <hi>not in his anger,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:011299_0009_0F869F76B754FE48"/>
ſo as to <hi>conſume</hi> them. He puts them into the furnace, <hi>melts them and trys them</hi>; but there knows their <hi>ſouls in adverſity,</hi> carries them thro' <hi>fire and thro' water, and brings them out into a wealthy place; viſits their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions with a rod, and their iniquity with ſtripes,</hi> but his <hi>loving-kindneſs</hi> he doth <hi>not take from them, nor ſuffer his faithfulneſs to fail.</hi> He chaſtiſes his people, but not according to their iniquity. But as fathers pity their children under the ſmarting rod of a juſt correction, ſo the Lord pitieth them that fear him. And after his fatherly rebukes and diſcipline, often comforts his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as a child whom his mother comforteth, by wiping away the penitent tears, excited by her own tender and faithful correction. So God corrected Solomon, but did not take his <hi>mercy from him, as he took it from Saul.</hi> If his people are, in a juſt ſeverity, put away into a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable captivity in Babylon; yet ſuch are the Lord's mercies, that they are not conſumed; yea, they are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited in mercy, and brought forth out of thoſe their graves, and come again to their own land.</p>
            <p>Theſe mixed diſpenſations are much for the divine glory, and which are very much the delight of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme ruler. God often conducts in this manner to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſinners, as well as ſaints, towards the world, as well as the church.</p>
            <p>Thus a ſinner is chaſtened with pain on his bed, and by pining ſickneſs, brought nigh to the grave; but taught out of God's law, as well as corrected; and the rod and reproof give him wiſdom; he is withdrawn from his ſinful purpoſes, and pride hid from him; his ears opened to diſcipline, and inſtruction ſealed to him; he is effectually convinced of God's righteouſneſs, and of his own wickedneſs, accepts the puniſhment of his iniquity; then he is gracious unto him, delivers him from going down to the pit of deſtruction, thro' the divine inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that ranſom provided for our ſouls; and in love to his ſoul delivers him from the grave, and his eyes ſee the light. Lo! theſe, and ſuch like things, God works
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:011299_0010_0F869F77F163FB60"/>
oftentimes with man, to bring back his ſoul from the pit of hell, and his life from the deſtroyers.</p>
            <p>Of all the events of providence, repreſented Zech. 6th chap. by four chariots, coming out from between two mountains of braſs, i. e. from thoſe counſels and decrees of heaven, as immovable as mountains of braſs; of all theſe none ſeem ſo pleaſing to God, as thoſe in which were mixt coloured horſes, denoting the mixt diſpenſations of providence: Theſe going towards the north country, quieted his ſpirit (i. e. appeaſed his anger) there. They ſerved to vindicate his name, and maintain the honour of his rectoral righteouſneſs, and ſhew his tender mercies to be over all his works. And were exactly adapted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and bring to repentance, and ſo to purge iniquity.</p>
            <p>And even to the dark places of the earth, that are full of the habitations of cruelty, God leaves not himſelf without witneſs of his goodneſs, in giving them rain from heaven and fruitful ſeaſons, filling their hearts with food and gladneſs.</p>
            <p>We are now to ſhew, how we are herein to be imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators of God, and unite mercy and truth in all our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours for the purging of ſin. Not by mercy alone without truth, nor by truth alone without mercy; but both by an amiable union. And this we are to obſerve, as heads of families, members of a chriſtian church, or of civil ſociety. As heads of families, we ſhould put away iniquity far from our tabernacles; command our children and houſhold after us, to keep the way of the Lord, to do juſtice and judgment. And here, if we would do any thing to purpoſe, a parental tenderneſs and juſtice muſt be at an even ballance. We muſt not, by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful kind of haughty ſeverity, provoke our children to wrath; nor yet, by a falſe pity, by a fooliſh fondneſs, and miſtaken tenderneſs, ſpare the rod. The former would diſcourage them, and break their ſpirits, and ſpoil their manhood; and the latter be more pernicious to them than hatred itſelf; and both theſe extremes tend rather to encreaſe ſin, than to purge it. But tenderneſs, juſtice,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011299_0011_0F869F7921A017E0"/>
love and faithfulneſs, ſweetly tempered, and united; an affectionate tenderneſs to their perſons, and a juſt hatred to their ſins, will, if any thing, prevail to amend our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and keep them from thoſe exceſſes too incident to our thoughtleſs, inconſiderate youth and children.</p>
            <p>As members of a church, we are to unite truth and mercy. The great, important truths of the goſpel are not to be given up; but theſe truths muſt ever be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in love. A pure goſpel, and truth in it's native ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, muſt be firmly and ſtedfaſtly maintained, but with unfeigned tenderneſs to the children, and even to the enemies of the truth; but muſt never be given up out of complaiſance to any in the world. <hi>Buy the truth and ſell it not.</hi> But in the diſcipline of the chriſtian churches, truth or juſtice muſt not be ſtrained to the wrong of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, but in a godly diſcipline, mercy muſt temper our judgments reſpecting the miſcarriages of others. And many leſſer failings may be paſſed over with a <hi>"peradventure it was an overſight."</hi> And all proper allowance is to be made for the natural infirmities of others: And we that are ſtrong muſt, with a generous compaſſion, bear the infirmities of the weak, and not pleaſe a ſelf-ſufficient temper in ourſelves. Children in a family are to be born with, but not ſo far as to be ſuffered to rule the houſe: <hi>Let all your things be done with charity,</hi> is eſpecially wholeſome and neceſſary in all brotherly duties. No ill will muſt influence: The truth of facts muſt not be given up; but mercy as much as may be mitigate the ſtrictneſs and ſeverity which juſtice and truth may ſeem to demand: the golden rule of our Saviour, of doing to others, as we would in a like caſe, they ſhould do unto us, is, if it can be, more bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in matters of church diſcipline than in common mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality. If a brother be overtaken in a fault, we muſt put ourſelves in his ſoul's ſtead, and reſtore him with the ſpirit of meekneſs, conſidering ourſelves, and as we ſhould think it reaſonable to be reſtored; and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering that, if the Lord ſhould ſtrictly mark iniquity,

no fleſh could ſtand in his preſence. We ſhould imitate the patience and long-ſuffering of God, and his ready forgiveneſs.</p>

               <l>"He ſaw their fleſh was weak and frail,</l>
               <l>"He ſaw temptations ſtill prevail;</l>

            </q>
            <p>Eli's mercy had no truth or juſtice in it, except in too gentle and cold reaſonings; while he honoured his ſons above God. The truth or juſtice of Diotrephe<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> was intolerably ſevere, to refuſe the brethren recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by an Apoſtle, forbidding them that would, and caſting them out of the church. And why all this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſs ſeverity, but the petty differences betwixt the jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh and the gentile chriſtians? The old ſaying is hereby verified; extreme right is extreme wrong. But all that ſet truth and purity before peace, and judiciouſly unite them, take the direct way to church purity. For God himſelf purges away the filth of the daughter of Zion, and blood of Jeruſalem, by the ſpirit of judgment, and by the ſpirit of burning.</p>
            <p>Thus alſo, in civil ſociety, all that would do any thing to purpoſe for purging the iniquity of a nation or land, muſt be ſure to proceed with truth, mercy and juſtice. It is a ſad time, indeed, when there is no truth nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land. Sin will be the reproach and ruin of ſuch a people. But where theſe prevail, righteouſneſs will exalt a nation or people.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe our miniſters of juſtice, in their ſuperabound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy, ſhould ſpare the vileſt criminals: No evil would be put away, and they would bear the ſword in vain. Vice would be daring, and the wicked walk on all hands; and men would treat the civil miniſters, as they treat their God; and becauſe ſentence againſt their evil works, is not ſpeedily executed, their hearts would be fully ſet in them to do evil. And all the honour of government would be loſt, and in their much mercy proſtituted in favour of wickedneſs. Thus Saul, in fooliſh pity, ſpared Agag, contrary to truth, and the juſt
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011299_0013_0F869F7D39AD59B0"/>
command of God; and by his miſplaced tenderneſs loſt his kingdom. So David, in the very weakneſs of paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal mercy, ſpared Abſalom; who not long after aroſe in an unnatural rebellion againſt his father, and attempted to joſtle him from the throne, and hunted for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious life; requiting his lenity, as other falſe favours uſed to be.</p>
            <p>Thus Ahab ſpared Benhadad, a man God had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to utter deſtruction; but it is hard to ſay, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a more infatuated mercy, or ill concerted policy; for his life muſt go, and that of his people for the king and people that he ſpared. The next war, they will fight only or eſpecially with the king of Iſrael to requite him for his ſuperlative tenderneſs, in ſaying of Benhadad, "<hi>is he yet alive? he is my brother.</hi>" It would be eaſy to prove by dint of common ſenſe, and by the Roman orator, as well as by the holy BIBLE, that ſuch miniſters of juſtice would be ſome of the moſt unmerciful men in the world; cruel to ſociety, and even to the criminals, (who would hereby be hardned in ſin) as well as falſe and treacherous to their God, whoſe deputies and vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents they are.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe, on the other hand, miniſters of juſtice, in a relentleſs kind of ſeverity, and caſting off all pity, ſhould ſtrain every charge to the higheſt pitch, and puniſh to the utmoſt extremity of law; connive at the moſt vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atious ſuits, under pretence of zeal againſt wrong and injuſtice; would not righteouſneſs ſpring up as poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hemlock in the furrows of the field; and much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief be daily framed by law? Thus mercileſs was the truth and juſtice of Saul, in his raſh ſentence upon his ſon Jonathan, dooming him to ſure death, only for taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little honey, while he knew nothing of the prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition; but the people had ſenſe, humanity and mercy enough to reſcue from that cruel ſentence, a man, by whom God had wrought ſo great a ſalvation that day. Jehu's truth and juſtice, in executing the houſe of Ahab, were ſo overſtrained, that God afterwards viſited that blood of Jezreel upon the houſe of Jehu.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:011299_0014_0F869F7DE26CD9D8"/>So the hypocritical Iſraelites executed without mercy the inhabitants of Jabeſh-Gilead, becauſe they came not to the war againſt Benjamin; becauſe not God's honour, but their own, was a little touched. And we are ſorry to find ſuch a blemiſh to the reign of the man after God's own heart, as his putting the children of Ammon under ſaws and harrows of iron, and making them to paſs through the brick kilns. But it is ſuppoſed to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen when his heart was hardened in the matter of Uriah.</p>
            <p>But let juſtice take place, ſo far as to ſuppreſs vice, maintain right and equity, and ſupport the honour of government; but not at the expence of mercy, and even of humanity. Let the vileſt criminals be pitied, as much as may be, conſiſtent with truth and juſtice. Let evil be put away with ſuch a juſt ſeverity, that <hi>all Iſrael may hear and fear, and do no more ſo wickedly.</hi> But let judge and jury act with pity, and none proſecute with <hi>a rage that reacheth unto heaven.</hi> Let neither court nor jury be tools of malice, but cruſh all vexatious informations or warrants, and like Gallio (in this a pattern) drive them from the judgment ſeat.</p>
            <p>This tempering mercy with judgment is the way to purge the iniquity of the land, and to ſecure peace to the people, and in their own minds, in all their admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of juſtice. Then are our <hi>officers peace, and our exactors righteouſneſs.</hi> Iniquity ſtops her mouth, and vice is ſhamed and virtue crowned. Men will be afraid of ſuch a well tempered power, and be ſubject not only for wrath, but for conſcience ſake.</p>
            <p>When he that ruleth over men is juſt, ruling in the fear of God; in that ingenuous pity that never fails to accompany the fear of the Almighty; the end of civil government is attained, public judgments prevented, our lives and properties ſecured, and all our natural and charter rights maintained, and every man may live and rejoice under his own vine and fig-tree, and there be none to make him afraid.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:011299_0015_0F869F7E37485418"/>Pauſe here a little, and conſider the importance of this doctrine: Iniquity not purged will be <hi>bitterneſs in the latter end.</hi> Wo forever unto all workers of iniquity, that live and die unpurged. For ſo he that is filthy muſt be filthy ſtill, and that to all eternity. Nothing can be more tremendous than the divide threatning, <hi>ſurely this iniquity ſhall not be purged from you 'till ye die, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts. And thou ſhalt not be purged from thy filthineſs, 'till I have cauſed my fury to reſt upon thee.</hi> None but they that are purged from their old ſins, and have clean hands and pure hearts, can enter into the holy hill above: the unclean ſhall not come before him.</p>
            <p>Iniquity harboured and practiced in a family, will be it's ruin. The curſe of God is in the houſe of the wicked.</p>
            <p>Iniquity connived at in churches will incenſe the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, incur his diſpleaſure; be a worm at the root of all their purity, peace, and growth; weaken the nerves of a godly diſcipline, and ſap the very foundation of their faith, of which they will ſoon make ſhipwreck, after that of a good conſcience.</p>
            <p>Iniquity connived at, and unpuniſhed, will ſoon bring judgments upon the land. Achan committed a treſpaſs, and God was wroth with the whole congregation, and that man periſhed not alone in his iniquity. Such is the divine abhorrence of blood and murder, that if a man was found near a city of Iſrael in his blood, and the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſin not known, God would make inquiſition for blood, and viſit it upon that city, if they did not purge away, and ſhew their juſt abhorrence and deteſtation of the murder. It is a law of nature as well as the written law of God, <hi>him that ſheddeth man's blood, by man ſhall his blood be ſhed.</hi> And we humbly apprehend, that no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority upon earth can pardon a wilful murderer, without ſtepping into God's throne, and violating the very light and law of nature, and leaving the land greatly polluted, and expoſed to the vengeance of the ſupreme ruler; by whom king's reign and princes decree juſtice; but never gives authority againſt himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:011299_0016_0F869F7F5E2558A0"/>Whoremongers and adulterers God will judge! by this iniquity the land is polluted. A man in Iſrael muſt not give his daughter to be a proſtitute, leſt the land be given to whoredom, and the land be defiled. This is an iniquity to be puniſhed by the judges; and we know who hath ſaid, that ſuch <hi>ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God, and there ſhall by no means enter therein, any thing that defileth, or that worketh abomination: But without are dogs, and ſorcerers, and whoremongers.</hi> And wo to the drunkards; their glory (if they have any) ſhall be a fading flower. Whoredom, and wine, and new wine, take away the heart, captivate and enſlave the whole ſoul, eraſe all the ſeeds of virtue and religion, ſpoil the manly ſenſe, and level a man with the brute creatures. God has, of late years, ſent an army of noxious vermin to lay waſte the fruits of our orchards, before they be grown, to reveal his wrath from heaven againſt the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of this ſin.</p>
            <p>Becauſe of ſwearing the land mourneth. God is jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of his honour, and will not hold him guiltleſs that taketh his name in vain. So perjury, lying and ſtealing defile the land, as well as bring ruin upon the ſinners themſelves. The curſe that goeth forth enters into the houſe of the thief, and into the houſe of him that ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth falſely by God's name, abides in his houſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume it, with the timber thereof, and the ſtones thereof. God himſelf will come near to judgment, and be a ſwift witneſs againſt adulterers, and againſt falſe ſwearers. We add to theſe the profanation of the day of ſacred reſt, the Lord's day, appropriated to his honour; in which to celebrate the wonders of redeeming grace, on this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection day. To profane it by ſpeaking our own words, or doing our own ſecular buſineſs, or finding our own pleaſure; or by neglect of the holy ſolemnities of the day; is to throw contempt on all the works of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, to deſpiſe all the benefits of the redeemer's purchaſe, and to deſpiſe and deſtroy our own ſouls; no wonder then, that an affronted Saviour ſo often for this
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:011299_0017_0F869F808EBBE578"/>
ſin blaſts us in all our labours; and that upon them that come not up to keep this chriſtian feaſt of tabernacles, there ſhall be no rain of heavenly grace; or that he ſo often viſits us with droughts.</p>
            <p>Becauſe we execute not his judgments, nor keep his ſabbaths, God may e'er long be provoked to give us ſtatutes (civil or eccleſiaſtical) that are not good, and judgments whereby we cannot live. With what affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate a pathos did the pious governor Nehemiah re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate againſt this ſin? chap. xiii. ver. 17, 18. <hi>Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and ſaid unto them, what evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day? did not your fathers thus? and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Iſrael by profaning the ſabbath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But thus are we led to what was more eſpecially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, in a way of application, and to the occaſion of the preſent diſcourſe, viz. to improve the awful diſpenſation in the week paſt. Iniquity purged, by purging the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner out of the world. As we are at the diſtance of but eight miles, many of you, my brethren, attended the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution three days ago: You beheld the bitter effects of ſin, in a miſcreant hung up between heaven and earth, as fit for neither: you heard a ſolemn and pertinent ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon on the ſhocking occaſion: you beheld his dying agonies; and I truſt the eye affected the heart. The like has not been done in this county for more than twenty years.</p>
            <p>Perhaps there never was an execution like to this, wherein mercy and truth, or mercy and juſtice, were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter united. A whole year paſſed after he was found guilty, before his ſentence. This gave room for mercy, if any way could be hit upon, for mercy to rejoice againſt judgment. No way was ſound. They that were moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his high-handed wickedneſs, were obliged to ſay, in tenderneſs to mankind, and eſpecially to the female ſex, what they maliciouſly ſaid of Paul, <hi>away
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011299_0018_0F869F8147FFF170"/>
with ſuch a fellow from the earth, for it is not fit that he ſhould live.</hi> There was mercy to his ſoul, in afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him a year to conſider his latter end, and prepare for it. In him ſeemed to be literally verified the interceſſion of Chriſt for the barren fig-tree; <hi>Lord, let it alone this year, 'till I ſhall dig about it and dung it, and if it bear fruit well, and if not then after that thou ſhalt cut it down.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tenderneſs to a poor wretch, with a juſt indignation againſt his enormous villanies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeemed to govern the whole affair. And thus the land is purged, and we hope will ſtill be purged, and that all our Iſrael will hear and fear, and do no more ſo wickedly. He is ſet up as a Lot's wife for us to remember, and be cautioned and warned. I have learned, that when a child, he began to ſteal, to lie, and refuſe all wholſome diſcipline; tho' taught to read and write, was never the better for all the inſtructions and corrections, ſo early applied. When about 14 years of age, ran away from his maſter, got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to wicked company, and was ſoon debauched and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened in ſin, and his heart fully ſet in him to do evil: ſoon became overmuch wicked, and has now died before his time. His darling luſts were idleneſs, drunkenneſs, uncleanneſs, and lying and ſtealing, with a moſt profane contempt of the name and day of God, and all ſacred things. He drew <hi>iniquity with cords of vanity,</hi> and <hi>ſinned as with a cart-rope.</hi> So paſt all feeling or remorſe of conſcience, that he gave himſelf over to work all uncleanneſs, and the fouleſt vices, with greedineſs. And O ſhocking ſtupidity! could laugh at hell and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, even while he did not profeſſedly deny their reality. He was led captive by the Devil at his will. For ſeven years, eſpecially, he ſerved him with all his power, and often wearied himſelf to commit iniquity. And if all his enormous villanies, and wrongs to men, could be enumerated, and a ballance made for his inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, what a black catalogue would there be of his crimes, and what a vaſt ſum to repair the wrongs he has done!</p>

               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:011299_0019_0F869F851BE2C758"/>He appeared hardened in his ſin, till after his ſentence, about four weeks before his untimely death. After which he read his bible, and much pains was taken with him, to what purpoſe God only knows; to me his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance ſeemed not equal to the enormous wickedneſs of his life; and there is reaſon to fear, that one who had been ſo arch and hypocritical in his wickedneſs, might not be without ſome degree of diſſimulation in his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. It may be ſaid of him, as of Judas, he repented; but whether he was ſorry for ſin becauſe he muſt be hanged; or was really pricked in his heart, and mourned for ſin, as a diſhonour to God and grief to Chriſt; or would not, if ſet at liberty, have returned to ſin again, as a dog to his vomit, muſt be left to the great deciſive day; when we ſhall clearly diſcern betwixt the righteous and the wicked; between him that ſerveth God and him that ſerveth him not. He is fallen a victim to juſtice, and for a warning to all, that they may not follow his pernicious ways, leſt they come to the like woful end. In him is literally fulfilled that of the Apoſtle, <hi>when luſt hath conceived, it bringeth forth ſin, and ſin when it is finiſhed bringeth forth death. Haſt thou heedfully marked the old way which wicked men have trodden, which were cut down out of time?</hi> Or, are ye willing to hear, in a way of caution and warning, ſome remarks upon the wicked way of this poor criminal, that has not lived half his days.</p>
            <p>REMARK I. The deſerting our lawful buſineſs, place or calling, is the open door to ruin. <hi>Let every man in the calling wherein he is called, therein abide with God.</hi> But they that will not do their own buſineſs, nor act in character, go out of the way of duty into the way of temptation; and, in a ſenſe, outrun the divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, which it is preſumption to expect out of our way. <hi>What doſt thou here, Elijah?</hi> is implicitly demanded of all that forſake their duty and functions in life. Thus Abſalom, to ſcreen himſelf from juſtice, ran away to his
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:011299_0020_0F869F85C11CF920"/>
pagan grandfather; and there hardened in ſin, and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it ſeems, to deſpiſe his own father, for the meanneſs of his extraction; and was ripened for the moſt unnatural treaſon, and moſt infamous ruin. Such in effect invert the ſixth petition in the Lord's prayer, ſaying, lead us into temptation and deliver us not from evil. Nor will they go unto the wiſe, that would counſel them to return to their duty, but walk in the counſel of the ungodly, and ſtand in the way of ſinners, that will patronize their wickedneſs, and entice them on in the way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. All this is verified, not only in this inſtance, ſo recent in our memory, but the laſt that was executed in the county of Middleſex, liſted into the regular ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, without the conſent (I think) of parents or maſter; and by the like headſtrong pride, and ignorant ſelf-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, he forfeited his life ſeveral times before it was taken from him. It is thought that the Angels not keeping their firſt eſtate, but leaving their own habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, means their deſerting their poſt, place, ſtation, and buſineſs aſſigned them by their creator, in the rank of beings; and ſo, inſtead of remaining bright ſtars in the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament of glory, were hurled down from the lofty battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of heaven, and became comets or wandering ſtars, to whom is reſerved the blackneſs of darkneſs forever.</p>
            <p>REMARK II. That drunkenneſs and whoredom not only eſtrange a perſon from all piety and religion; but deſtroy the natural ſenſe, benumb conſcience, and eraſe humanity itſelf. He that is abhorred of the Lord ſhall fall into this pit. Their very hearts hate inſtruction, and deſpiſe reproof. And tho' you ſhould bray ſuch a fool in a mortar, with a peſtle among wheat, yet will not his fooliſhneſs depart from him.</p>
            <p>This wretched creature being deeply plunged in theſe vices, at the age of about 14, ſoon threw away all the checks of conſcience and reſtraints of education, and did not at all ſtickle at lying, ſtealing, and the greateſt wrongs, to ſupport his debaucheries. In his printed
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:011299_0021_0F869F86779B5230"/>
confeſſion he ſays, "but in a particular manner, I would ſolemnly warn thoſe of my own colour, as they regard their own ſouls, to avoid deſertion from their maſters, drunkenneſs, and lewdneſs, which three crimes was (<hi>were</hi> it ſhould be) the ſource from which have flowed the many evils and miſeries of my ſhort life."</p>
            <p>REMARK III. The wilful contempt of the name, day, and word of God, is in effect to give place to the Devil, who is always ready to rule the children of diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. They that will not have Chriſt to reign over them, do virtually ſubmit to the ſlavery of the Devil, who will ſee to it that the wicked man travels in pain all his days. No man knows the tour of that fatal night, but muſt own the hand of a juſt, incenſed God, in giving him over; and the hand of Satan in precipitating him headlong to deſtruction. He aroſe out of a warm bed, on a cold night, and left all aſleep, and after a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated theft, in favour of his wicked deſign, rode ſeveral miles to find out one who had before been the infamous inſtrument of his ruin; miſſing of her, the Devil put it into his head, in the dead of night, to go ſo many miles, to perpetrate the villany for which he ſuffered. Thus he wearied himſelf to commit a capital iniquity. Satan is a hard and cruel maſter.</p>
            <p>REMARK IV. The eſcaping with impunity hardens the wicked, and emboldens them in ſin yet more and more. If they do evil an hundred times, and their days be prolonged; and the tabernacles of robbers proſper for a while; they grow audacious and preſumptuous, and conclude to-morrow ſhall be as this day and much more abundant. His eſcapes were often ſtrange and hard to be accounted for, but by ſuppoſing him to be left of God to go on without controul, the ſooner to fill up his meaſure of ſin, and knowing his fall to be at hand. <hi>The Lord ſhall laugh at him, for he ſeeth that his day is coming.</hi> However his many eſcapes from condign pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:011299_0022_0F869F87AE708108"/>
and his having loſt all ſenſe of ſin, rendered him inſenſible of danger, not only of the wrath to come, but of the verdict of the jury; flattering himſelf, it ſeems, all the year, that he ſhould eſcape that death of which he has been found guilty; and I have good reaſon to think, that, even after his ſentence, he ſtill flattered himſelf in his own eyes, till he found all had abandoned him, in regard to his forfeited life. Thus Satan could prompt Agag to ſay, "<hi>ſurely the bitterneſs of death is paſt." He flattereth himſelf in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found</hi> (by woful experience) <hi>to be hateful.</hi> The ſame Devil that decoys into ſin, flatters with impunity, and ſo hardens the heart, 'till they fall into further miſchief and ruin.</p>
            <p>REMARK V. Not the moſt ſhocking death, but only almighty grace will break an heart of ſtone. Iſrael could ſee all the terrors of Mount Sinai, and Lot's two daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters behold, and narrowly eſcape the flames of Sodom, yet remain as they were. The impenitent thief (or both while impenitent) could rail at the Lord of glory on the croſs. It is the peculiar work of the almighty Spirit, to take the ſtony heart out of out fleſh, and give us hearts of fleſh. Condemned criminals will go no further in their repentance than legal ſorrow for ſin, becauſe they muſt ſuffer for it; unleſs the divine Spirit work in them that repentance which is unto ſalvation. At the laſt, he had an hope that ſupported him againſt the terrors of a ſhocking death, or was, to aſtoniſhment, ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid and inſenſible of his danger. He ſaid, when going to the place of execution, that he was willing to die; and juſt before he was turned off, being aſked by the officer, if he had any thing to ſay, anſwered with a low voice, "No; but that I would that poor creatures be warned that they come not to my doleful end." If he found mercy with the Lord, in that day, he will praiſe and magnify his name forevermore, for his great mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, in delivering his ſoul from the loweſt hell;
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:011299_0023_0F869F884B7AB0B0"/>
and in timely ſoftening his heart by omnipotent grace, as that of the penitent thief on the croſs.</p>
            <p>REMARK VI. All whoſe hearts are fully ſet in them to do theſe, or like evils, and will not be reclaimed, are in the high road to deſtruction, if not by the way of the gallows. When any are ſo joined to idols, as that they muſt needs be let alone, to ſin without controul; and the moſt gentle means, or juſt ſeverities, are in vain, their caſe is very ſad, if not deſperate. <hi>Let favour be ſhewed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, in the land of uprightneſs</hi> (or religion) <hi>he will deal unjuſtly, and will not behold the majeſty of the Lord: Why ſhould</hi> he <hi>be ſtricken any more? he will revolt more and more.</hi> He that hateth and deſpiſeth reproof ſhall die. <hi>Correct thy ſon, and</hi> it may be expected that <hi>he will give thee reſt</hi>; but if, out of a fooliſh fondneſs, you indulge him in wickedneſs, he will give you trouble enough: But the beſt inſtructions, and moſt tender cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, will not reclaim them that, like this now ruined youth, have their hearts fully ſet in them to do evil. So we muſt leave them to take their courſe, and chuſe the road to death. If they are wiſe, they are wiſe for themſelves; if they are ſcorners, they alone muſt bear it.</p>
            <p>REMARK VII. If any young people are reſolved upon their own ruin, the way is open and broad, and eaſy to find—it is, in a word, to walk in pride, in the way of their own heart, and in the ſight of their own eyes; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting all the counſels of God, of paſtors, or parents, againſt themſelves. Let the eye that loves death mock at his father and deſpiſe to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley ſhall pick it out, the young eagles ſhall eat it. Let them pull away the ſhoulder, and refuſe to hear the words which the Lord of hoſts ſends to them by the former prophets, by Chriſt or his Apoſtles. Let them profane the name and day of God. Let their life be with the drunkard and the unclean. Never go to the
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:011299_0024_0F869F88B677B9C0"/>
wiſe, but be the companions of fools, and go in company with the workers of iniquity, who are to be deſtroyed. Follow wicked counſels to practice iniquity; caſt off fear and reſtrain prayer before God. Say <hi>what is the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty that we ſhould ſerve him, and what profit ſhall we have if we pray unto him?</hi> Let them, with a ſtiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necked reſolution, purſue their own ways, and delight in their own abominations. Very ſoon will their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties be full, or they will treaſure up the more <hi>wrath againſt the day of wrath, and the revelation of his righteous judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>REMARK VIII. The ſame Devil that tempts to ſin, and helps to palliate it, and flatters with impunity, will abandon, or rather betray them at laſt. Sin and Satan may for a while ſcreen from juſtice. Thoſe words of the wiſe man, <hi>neither ſhall wickedneſs deliver them that are given to it,</hi> intimate, that it may ſeem to deliver, or one wickedneſs ſerve to cloak and cover another, but will not long avail. But tho' a ſinner do evil an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times, and his days be prolonged, yet it ſhall not long be well with the wicked, nor ſhall he prolong his days which are as a ſhadow. After all the ſtrange eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capes of this—ſo arch in wickedneſs, it appears by his conduct after his life was forfeited, that the Devil is no more to be truſted as a protector, than as a tempter. He not only returned home, after his atrocious vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainy, (tho' ſo well practiſed in running away) but after he was arreſted by the officer and gave him the ſlip, with a good horſe, ſillily for himſelf, went home and ſo was re-taken. And when he broke priſon, was no ſooner abandoned by his companions, but he went to a public houſe, where he had been acquainted, and ſo was re-taken, and ſent back to priſon. So he was at laſt infatuated, to meet his deſerved end. This we view as the holy hand of God, leaving him to be at laſt inſnared in the work of his own hands; and as the hand of Satan deſerting him, whom he had ſo often
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:011299_0025_0F869F897B48A2C0"/>
furniſhed with a corrupt will in wickedneſs, that he might the ſooner incur that ruin, to which the prince of this world had decoyed him. Thus remarkable is the hand of God in the infatuation of Pharaoh, and his ſervants; that he might make inquiſition for blood, and take vengeance for the murder of the male children of Iſrael. Moſes is ordered to turn towards the red ſea, and encamp beſide Pihahiroth; where the unarmed hoſts of Iſrael muſt be hemmed in on all ſides. Pharaoh now concludes that the wilderneſs had ſhut them in. They muſt fall an eaſy prey. He purſues them as ſure of victory; yea ſo infatuated, as to purſue them into the red ſea, which turned and covered them; and ſo the innocent blood of the male children was avenged. When Haman's face was covered, or that of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned criminal, we know what is next.</p>
            <p>REMARK IX. We may diſcover the cauſe that ſo many of the natives periſh from under goſpel light. Contempt of the means of grace, ſlighting the offers and opportunities vouchſafed to them, neglect of the great ſalvation, 'till God juſtly leaves them, and the grand adverſary enſnares them, to drunkenneſs and unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſo to become inſenſible to all the inſtructions of wiſdom. A late writer has obſerved, that "New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land rum has ruined more Indians than the goſpel has ſaved of them." Wherever this debauchee came among them, they were his counſellors to work wickedneſs; and by drunkenneſs and uncleanneſs, with them, ſoon loſt all the little remains of the natural ſenſe of moral virtue. They had better have been brought up in the wilds of Africa, or in the remoteſt corners of the world, than thus to hear the joyful ſound of the goſpel ſalvation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this grace of God in vain; after all failing <hi>of the grace of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>REMARK X. If any are willing to be cautioned and warned, they have now an opportunity afforded them by heaven; a Lot's wife deſigned for a warning to all

            <p>REMARK XI. If any are wicked counſellors to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren or ſervants, as the houſe of Ahab to Ahaziah,— his counſellors to work wickedneſs; here is a voice from heaven to them, in this awful providence. A voice as loud as thunder, to awaken them to conſider their ways.</p>
            <p>What muſt the wicked adviſers of poor Arthur one day feel in their racked conſciences? What their meeting in the other world? Children that are corruptors, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of other mens ſins, plotters of miſchief, muſt one day give an account of all the wickedneſs committed
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:011299_0027_0F869F8D89769B80"/>
by their advice, or ſinful connivance. One ſuch ſinner deſtroys much good. They are the Devil's agents to deſtroy ſouls, and bodies too, as in the late inſtance. They hunt for the precious life. O that all our young people were ſo wiſe, as when ſinners entice them, not to conſent, but conſider them as enemies; yea as incarnate Devils, engaged on Satan's ſide, doing his work, and to receive his wages. They that enſnare others to go with them to the pit of miſery, will find it leſs tolerable than to have gone there alone.</p>
            <p>REMARK XII. That to ſin againſt, and after ſuch a ſolemn alarm from heaven, is to ſin at a dear rate. Wo to them that are not hereby admoniſhed, ſo, as to ſhun thoſe dangerous precipices, where one has ſo lately fallen headlong to ruin. They that live in the like ſins, are in the ſame way, though they may not have proceeded ſo far. The way of ſin is down-hill. <note n="*" place="bottom">Nemo repente fit turpiſſimus.</note> No man is entirely abandoned to wickedneſs all at once. Sad and awful indeed if the drunkard will ſtill wallow in his vomit, if the unclean will not repent of the fornication which they have committed, but proceed from evil to evil, and add ſin to ſin, running greedily after the errors of this profligate, notwithſtanding his bitter end; if the thieves will yet watch for their neighbours goods. <hi>Let him that ſtole ſteal no more.</hi> Sad indeed, if lyars ſtill meditate deceit, and utter from the heart words of falſhood.

               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:011299_0028_0F869F8E934D40F0"/>REMARK XIII. Here is a voice of God to heads of families, parents and maſters, to inſtruct thoſe under their care; to guide them with their eye, and endeavour early to inſtil into them the principles of virtue, and to furniſh the young men with knowledge and diſcretion, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort the riſing generation to be ſober-minded, and to <hi>have no fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of darkneſs, but rather to reprove them.</hi> How pathetical is that of Bathſheba to Solomon? <hi>What my ſon?

            <p>FINALLY, Let us all unite mercy and truth, in all our moral and religious conduct; in whatever ſtation and relation; in families, in churches, and in all our civil affairs. Be thankful for the civil government, that juſtice is adminiſtred, and the oppreſſed vindicated from wrongs and violence, and iniquity obliged to ſtop her mouth. If any do evil, let them be afraid of the power of the civil magiſtrate; for he beareth not the ſword in vain, as we ſaw in the week paſt. But who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good? Civil rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Let us be thankful for that reſtraining grace, that has kept us from ſuch notorious exceſſes.
