            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T a time, when the unjuſt ſtorm of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial wrath, is diſcharging itſelf in a cruel and ignominous manner, on the noble, patriotic, brave people of the ancient, loyal important colony of the Maſſachuſetts-Bay, in New-England;—at a time when all the other colonies in North-Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, like the true children of <hi>a free-born family,</hi> are rouſed to ſome juſt reſentment of ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults, on their natural and legal rights, taking each other as by the hand, and uniting by the invincible chains of love, friendſhip, and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, are determined to ſupport this their elder ſiſter colony, now ſuffering ſo gloriouſly in the common cauſe, or <hi>ſink</hi> together.—At a time, when the alarm is ſounding from eaſt to weſt, over this vaſt continent of North-America, to arms!—to arms!—in ſhort, at a time when the minds of <hi>all</hi> are in ſuch a ferment, that they can be ſcarce com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to hear any ſubject, but what may have ſome reference to the preſent times; it is but reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſuppoſe, that even the Miniſter of the <hi>Prince
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013861_0005_0F9254889EC073A8"/>
of peace,</hi> whoſe buſineſs for ordinary is, neither <hi>war</hi> or <hi>politicks,</hi> in ſuch a ſituation, being mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of civil ſociety, and intereſted like other men, would improve the times, by adopting their public inſtructions, to the beſt ſervice of the people, and not offenſive or diſpleaſing to God; whoſe holy word is a bleſſed directory in every emergency.</p>
            <p>It is alſo but reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that every judicious, ſober American, being now reduced to the dreadful alternative, either to take up arms, apparently againſt that very government, which he was wont to revere, and under which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected protection for both life and property; or ſubmit tamely to the galling yoke of <hi>perpetual ſlavery;</hi> I ſay, it is ſuppoſable, that every ſuch Chriſtian American ſoldier will be all ear to wholeſome inſtructions, relative to his preſent duty.</p>
            <p>We own it is rare for ſoldiers to aſk counſel of goſpel Miniſters; and the more pity—for they are men and ſinners, as well as others; but I am not called to addreſs <hi>Red-Coats,</hi> but CHRISTIAN <hi>Provincials;</hi> yet bleſſed be God, it is not a caſe wholly unprecedented, for even regulars to apply to a goſpel Preacher for direction; we have an inſtance in the words of our text.—<hi>And the ſoldiers demanded of him, ſaying, And what ſhall we do? and he ſaid unto them, Do violence to no man, neither ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe any falſly, and be content with your wages</hi>—</p>
            <p>We here find a very important queſtion propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to a perſon, every way qualified to ſolve it; for the mouth of truth itſelf tells us, that of all who were then born of woman, there was not a greater prophet than John the Baptiſt: Alſo, the angel who predicted his birth, ſaid, that he ſhould be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the Holy Ghoſt, from his mother's womb. He was therefore deſervedly very popular—was
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013861_0006_0F92548939B5C208"/>
raiſed for the great purpoſe of introducing the Jewiſh church, to the Saviour of the world; and hence much true goſpel light ſhone round this great Preacher.—The anſwers he gave the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may be depended on to be ſufficient and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive.</p>
            <p>But let us hear, what does John ſay? Does he tell them, to lay down their arms, and throw them by, as there can be no ſort of war lawful? as ſome would have us believe!—No, no, this is not his anſwer; John knew better;—he knew the preſent ſtate of our depraved world would render war in many caſes unavoidable, and even neceſſary.—So that a ſoldier might ſerve the end of his being in his place and calling, as well as a plowman or preacher in theirs.</p>
            <p>But then it muſt be a juſt war, conducted in a lawful, righteous manner; for the legality of the action, will never juſtify the illegality of the manner of proſecution.</p>
            <p>The ſoldier muſt do violence to no man—muſt not accuſe any falſly—and muſt be content with his wages; leading vices theſe, for ordinary, among <hi>regular</hi> troops; but the CHRISTIAN <hi>ſoldier</hi> muſt guard againſt them, from the genuine prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of true religion, in the heart; and then may hope for heaven, as well from a field of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, as expiring on his couch in the midſt of peace and tranquility.</p>
            <p>I now deduce this doctrine from the text, thus explained—Doctrine.</p>
            <p>That although war is in itſelf a very great evil, and one of thoſe ſore judgments, by which a holy God puniſhes the world for ſin, therefore to be deprecated, and avoided as much as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; yet is at times, by reaſon of certain cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumſtances, ſo unavoidable, that it is our duty to enter into it.—The method I deſign to
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013861_0007_0F925489F9353BB0"/>
purſue, in opening up the doctrine, for improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is the following:—
<list>
                  <item>I. Humbly attempt to ſhew (with ſubmiſſion to better judgment) when a war is ſo unavoidable and neceſſary, that it is our duty to enter into it.</item>
                  <item>II. Shew how we ſhould enter into, and proſecute even a juſt war.</item>
                  <item>III. Improve the ſubject, by the deduction of a few natural inferences from the whole.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>You are ſenſible, my hearers, that there are ſome Chriſtian people in the world, and ſome of them in theſe parts, who merit the regard of the public, by their general character of induſtry, inoffenſiveneſs, and ſobriety; yet do maintain it, as a ſacred conſcientious tenet, not to be diſpenſed with, <hi>not to go to war, or take up arms on any occaſion whatſoever</hi>; and charity, the leading grace of the Chriſtian ſyſtem, will lead us to deal tenderly with ſuch, as far as we have grounds to believe they are ſincere in their profeſſion: We ought to pity ſuch for their miſtake, and, if poſſible, to convince them; but not by any means to urge them againſt their avowed ſentiments, leſt we come under the odious appellation of <hi>perſecutors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As far as theſe ſober people make uſe of the Bible, to found their principles on, they rely on ſuch paſſages as theſe, Gen. ix.6. <hi>He that ſheddeth man's blood, by man ſhall his blood be ſhed</hi>; and Exod. xx.13. <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill</hi>; and in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>But I ſay unto you, love your enemies;—if any ſmite thee on the one cheek, turn to him the other al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo;—for all they that take the ſword ſhall periſh by the ſword:</hi> Matth. v. 39, 44. and xxvi. 52. and hence conclude, though I think falſly, that all war is unlawful, except the ſpiritual, with our own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, by the ſword of the ſpirit, in Chriſt's
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:013861_0008_0F92548ABAFF2258"/>
ſpiritual kingdom, which is not of this world, elſe would his children fight.</p>
            <p>But if I miſtake not, theſe people regard only ſuch paſſages of holy ſcripture, as ſeem to favour their favourite opinion, let the language of other paſſages be what they will;—and hence their own imagination is ſubſtituted inſtead of divine reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, ſo that when people are determined to keep by a ſentiment, be it right or wrong, there is an end of all diſputation.—</p>
            <p>We readily allow, that it would be happy for us all, if there was no moral or natural evil in the world: But how plauſible ſoever ſuch opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may appear, to the weal of ſociety, they are rather calculated to the condition of innocent, than depraved nature; which now is, and ever has been ſuch, ſince the fall of our firſt parents, that there is need of ſome remedy to curb its evil tendencies, or mankind would ſcarce be able to ſubſiſt in the world; and this our indulgent, righteous Creator knows; and has therefore ſet up civil government to keep man from deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each other: But civil government has no power, if it has not the ſword, to be a terror to evil doers,—and a praiſe to them that do well.—Hence it will follow, that men are under a neceſſity to part with ſome of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural rights, to ſecure the reſt;—they muſt give part of their earnings to ſuch as are choſen by themſelves, to rule the whole;—and then again, they muſt help the rulers to execute the good and wholſome laws of government, againſt their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators. Suppoſe, for inſtance, a great banditti riſe to reſcue murderers; if theſe are not quelled, government is overthrown, if the people do not aſſiſt good government, and here then ariſes a neceſſity to go to war.</p>
            <p>And ſuppoſe again, on the other hand, which

is very ſuppoſable, That the rulers of the people ſhould give way to the many temptations their high ſtations will lead them to; to indulge evil, the inclinations of a luſt for abſolute dominion, independent of the people, ſo that all the barrier of oaths and covenants are broke through, to effect the plan; and the people have no ſecurity, for either life or property, but the mere ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign pleaſure of the abſolute rulers;—then the people are under a diſagreeable, but preſſing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſity, rather than be cruſhed by an iron rod, to re-aſcertain their own juſt rights; and ſtand forth all of them to oppoſe ſuch tyranny:—Here then is another inſtance of ſelf-defence—in which a war is both unavoidable and neceſſary, and therefore lawful, if ſelf-preſervation is lawful; which is the point I ſhall next, in order, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to prove indiſputably, both from the light of nature, and divine revelation; and firſt from the light of nature.</p>
            <p>It is certainly evident, wherever we turn our eyes, on any part of the whole creation of God, that the principle of ſelf-love or ſelf-preſervation or the deſire of exiſtence, is deeply engraved on the nature of every creature. And when this great firſt principle is obſerved, it is, and muſt be agreeable to God, as he will love his own work; and ſo alſo, the neglect of the exerciſe of this principle, can not but diſpleaſe him, as it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural and monſtrous. Thus the generous vine will extend her arms, to lay hold on the firſt neighbouring prop; and with her little tender tendants, twine around it, to preſerve her cluſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers from periſhing on the cold ground.</p>
            <p>The little induſtrious bee, is furniſhed by her Creator, with a ſting to preſerve for her own uſe, to herſelf, her ſweet honey, the fruit of her toil and induſtry.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:013861_0010_0F92548C4D866ED0"/>The ox has his horns; and the horſe his teeth and hoofs.—The deer her feet for flight, and the fowls their wings to eſcape danger, and preſerve themſelves. And ſhall man, the nobleſt creature in the lower world, be deſtitute of this neceſſary principle! which we ſee engraved by inſtinct on the irrational creation? Man is bleſt with reaſon to direct his enquiries, in ſearch of happineſs. His maker God allows him to ſeek, to be as happy as he poſſibly can, both in this life and the life to come. But ſince man is a fallen, ſinful creature, he has loſt his true road to happineſs—and can never find it, until his maker points it out to him in the Holy Bible. Here we are taught how to conduct both in the civil and religious life: We are certain the ſcriptures allow us to defend our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the beſt manner we can againſt an enemy.</p>
            <p>Therefore, ſuch paſſages, as would ſeem to ſpeak a different language; ſuch as thoſe already quoted, muſt be underſtood, in a conſiſtency with this great law of nature; as well as conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with other parts of ſcripture. For Chriſt came not to make void, or deſtroy the law, but to fulfil—when therefore we are forbid to ſhed blood, or to kill; it is innocent blood is meant— but this doth not forbid to execute a murderer. The divine law requires, that a murderer ſhould be executed, and forbids to take a ranſom for his life.</p>
            <p>Alſo, when a body of wicked people join to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, or a nation unite, to call upon and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy without any juſt cauſe an innocent people. The inſulted, or invaded people, are then to unite together, to oppoſe, expel and puniſh the guilty invaders—as in Judges v. 23. <hi>Curſe ye Meroz (ſaid the Angel of the Lord,) curſe ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof: Becauſe they can not to the help of the Lord, againſt the mighty:</hi> And Jeremiah
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013861_0011_0F92548D007D88B8"/>
xlviii.10. <hi>Curſed be he that doth the work of the Lord deceitfully; and curſed be he that keepeth back his ſword from blood:</hi> And in Luke xxii. 36. Jeſus Chriſt told his Diſciples to arm themſelves againſt approachng danger.—<hi>And he that hath no ſword let him ſelf his garment and buy one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſince our Lord did not allow the Diſciples then to defend themſelves by their weapons, for when Peter cut off Malcus's ear he immediately healed it, and bid Peter to put up his ſword, to let them know, and the enemy alſo know, that he was Lord of life and death—and that the Diſciples were ſafe with ſuch a perſon as Jeſus, while the age of miracles continued; I ſay, ſince this was the caſe then, we muſt underſtand the paſſage to intend, that it is both lawful and a duty, for the followers of Jeſus Chriſt, in a time and age, when we are not to expect miracles, to arm ourſelves and uſe our arms for our own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation againſt any invading enemy.</p>
            <p>Alſo, it muſt of courſe follow, that where our bleſſed Lord enjoins us, when ſmote on the one cheek, to turn the other alſo, he does not mean to forbid us to uſe lawful and proper means of ſelf-preſervation. But the meaning muſt be as the phraſe is proverbial, that we ſhould at no time diſcover a revengeful or unforgiving diſpoſition; but ſhould be ready to put up with a good deal of ill-uſage, before we would create diſturbance,— yea that we ſhould do any thing conſiſtent with our own ſafety. Again, where our Lord enjoins us to love our enemies—he can't poſſibly mean that we ſhould love them better than ourſelves— that we ſhould put it in the enemy's power to kill us, when we had it in our power to ſave our own life, by killing the enemy. I ſay, this cannot be the meaning; for that expoſition will thwart the original firſt great law of ſelf-preſervation. The
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:013861_0012_0F925492A6E029E8"/>
meaning therefore muſt be, that we do not che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh a ſpirit of hatred towards the enemies, and would be willing to be reconciled again—and would be deſirous, the enemy would be convinced of his evil ſentiment againſt us, that we might be again on friendly terms,—that we can be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere in our prayer to God, to bring ſuch a deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able event to paſs. Again,</p>
            <p>That a ſelf-defenſive war is lawful, I will prove from the conduct of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf. If civil government is neceſſary to ſelf-preſervation, and war is neceſſary, at times, in government, as has been already proved; then it will follow, that thoſe who ſupport civil government, do ſupport war, and ſo of conſequence approve of war. But Jeſus Chriſt did pay his tribute money, to the Emperor Tiberius, Matthew xvii, 27, and thoſe who are acquainted with the life of Tiberius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar, know that he had frequent wars. Our Lord did here, as in ſeveral other places, draw a line of diſtinction between church and ſtate; the church was his own kingdom, and ſpiritual in its nature and government, and was not of this world; but the ſtate was a diſtinct conſtitution, was of this world, was purely civil, and it was not eſſential to the being of an Emperor, of what ſort of religion he was of, or whether of any, as was the caſe of Tiberius; but as the Jews were tributaries to the Romans, and our Lord was a Jew by birth; he paid his tax as a peaceable member of the commonwealth; but had our Lord been a Menoniſt he would have refuſed to pay tribute, to ſupport war, which ſhews the abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of theſe people's conduct.</p>
            <p>Had our Lord been a Covenanter of the church of Scotland, he would refuſe to pay tribute, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Emperor was not a Covenanter.—I own, it is not eſſential to the very being of a King
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:013861_0013_0F9254949D85F008"/>
to be a Chriſtian, yet it is eſſential to the being of a good man, to be a Chriſtian; and certainly the more pious and truly godly any Chriſtian ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler is, if he is not a bigot to a party, or certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, but equally regardful of all, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, ſober, and well behaving, in all his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions—the happier for the people.—In Rom. 13, from the beginning, to the 7th verſe, we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed at large the duty we owe to civil-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but if it was unlawful and anti-Chriſtian, or anti-ſcriptural to ſupport war, it would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to pay taxes; if it is unlawful to go to war, it is unlawful to pay another to do it, or to go to do it: What a fooliſh trick thoſe people put on their conſciences, who for the reaſons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned will not pay their taxes, and yet let others come and take their money, where they can find it, and be ſure they will leave it where they can find it handily.</p>
            <p>I think I have now proved, from the light of nature, from the reaſon of things—from the Old and New-Teſtament as well as from the example of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, that a ſelf-defenſive war is lawful.</p>
            <p>Now thoſe who deny this doctrine ought, if they would be ingenious, candid and honeſt, to place their argument on this footing: Suppoſe themſelves capable of being by themſelves, all on ſome part of our Globe, and none elſe but themſelves; and ſuppoſe alſo, none elſe ever to come to them, and without any connection with any people, but themſelves, they had all the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries of life; in ſuch a ſituation, if they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with them the common nature of the human ſpecies, as it has diſcovered itſelf in the world in every age, ſince the fall of Adam; theſe good, peaceable, inoffenſive people, would ſoon find e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil diſpoſitions and practices break out even among
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013861_0014_0F92549624F97440"/>
themſelves, if they would then make no reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance at all, to thoſe evils, but on their avowed principles, when ſmote on the one cheek, turn the other; there would ſoon be an end of their ſociety—the evil would ſoon deſtroy the peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and good out of the world; then the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Almighty would undoubtedly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take and cut off the wicked, when there would be none elſe in the world; and then there would be an end to the being of mankind on the earth. Now this was the reſult of things in the Antede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luvian age, when there was no civil government at all in the world, the wicked deſtroyed the righteous, till there was none left but Noah;— the Almighty ſaved him by a miracle, and cut off the reſt entirely from the globe.—And though Noah was as good a man as any of thoſe people with whom I am now diſputing, his poſterity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated, and the world needed government to keep it in being to this day. It is alſo equally unfair, to ſay, <hi>Let us ſtand ſtill and ſee the ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God;</hi> for if this proves any thing, it proves too much, it proves that we are to uſe no means at all, for why to uſe lawful means in our power one time, and not another? we muſt therefore neither plow or ſow; build, raiſe ſtock, or do any any thing in the uſe of means, <hi>but ſtand ſtill and ſee the ſalvation of God:</hi> But our reaſon is given us to uſe it in a proper manner, to preſerve our own lives and the lives of others, as God's ſervants, in a ſtate of probation in this world; and God will reward every one finally according to his works; when we have no means in our power, we honor God to truſt him, as Iſrael at the Red-Sea, and in the wilderneſs;—but when means are in our power, and we do not uſe them, we then tempt God, and rebel againſt his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:013861_0015_0F925496C282EDD8"/>
which he exerciſes over the world, in the way of free and moral agency.</p>
            <p>Therefore for theſe people, to argue as they do now, when they are among other ſocieties, that they know will preſerve the ſtate from ſlaughter or ſlavery, in the uſe of lawful means, as has been now proved, is vaſtly diſingeneous, and will undoubtedly ſubject their opinions to this cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that it is a ſanctuary of ſloth—for greed— cowardice, <hi>&amp;c. — for it is eaſy to ſtay at home and earn money, to what it is to ſpend money and expoſe life, to protect and defend the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling coward;—it is eaſy to pay money, to what it is to be ſhot,</hi> &amp;c. But after all that has been ſaid, I am myſelf ſo warm an advocate for the ſacred rights of conſcience, that if theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will not be convinced of their duty; can not get their eyes open; they are to be pitied, but not perſecuted. I beg of all, for God and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake, to let them alone, if they will not in theſe terrible times, draw the ſword <hi>for</hi> Liberty and their country, ſurely they will not <hi>againſt</hi> Liberty and their country; and if we can do with them, we can without them: O then, let there be no diſturbance on that head!</p>
            <p>I now proceed to the ſecond thing propoſed, in this diſcourſe, to ſhew how a lawful war is to be carried on.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Every one that draws the ſword, ſhould be well ſatisfied, in his conſcience, that he is called of God to do ſo;—that, with a good conſcience and courage, he may rely on God for ſtrength and and protection.—Then it is drawn for theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or elſe it cannot be lawful; either to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a foreign enemy—or to aſſiſt the magiſtrates to ſuppreſs a riot, or wicked ſaction and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion that may have broke out, by a lawleſs ſet of ruffians, that will be under no reſtraint of law
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:013861_0016_0F9254978BAC9620"/>
—or to oppoſe the unjuſt, uſurped, anti-conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional claims of mere tyranny—or the eſſential and unalienable rights of the people.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. Every ſoldier ſhould ſee to it above all things, that his peace is made with God, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in his Son Jeſus Chriſt for ſalvation; and have ſome comfortable evidences of the truth of his faith, by his love to Jeſus Chriſt, in keeping his commandments;—elſe how can he expect a bleſſing, or ſucceſs, even in a juſt cauſe, if he is himſelf in a ſtate of enmity and rebellion againſt that God, in whoſe hand his life is, and whoſe are all his ways? For no ſoldier is ſo undaunted and truly couragious, as him that on the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of true religion, is above the fear of death.</p>
            <p>To ruſh forward on death, thoughtleſs of, and unprepared for, a future eternity, is rather a ſpecies of mere madneſs, than true heroiſm.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, As the Chriſtian ſoldier muſt ſet out in the fear of God, ſo he muſt perſevere, fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding in, and relying on, the juſtice and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the ſuperintendency of Jehovah, over all the fates, and to us unforeſeen occurrences, that may or can happen in time; and thus with becoming boldneſs and Chriſtian ſerenity, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with true courage, put his life in God's hands.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. The ſoldier muſt obſerve ſtrictly thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections in our text: <hi>He muſt do violence to no man;</hi> as ſoldiers carry with them the inſtruments of death, they are too prone to conduct themſelves towards the defenceleſs with pride and inſolence; ſomething of this temper diſcovered itſelf, at the time that theſe <hi>Regulars</hi> aſked John in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their aſking the queſtion;—others treated John with reſpect and manners;—the very Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans called him Maſter;—but the <hi>Red-Coats</hi> came and <hi>demanded of him,</hi> as if they were his ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:013861_0017_0F92549843F2E128"/>
and he muſt obey them.—As ſtanding armies are too frequently made up of the ſcowerings of gaols, and the refuſe and filth of the people, that make that the laſt ſhift for a living—they are but too often found deſtitute of either good principles or education, and ſunk into every ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of diſſoluteneſs and debauchery.—We could wiſh the King's troops at Boſton, had not by their cruelty and inhumanity of conduct, given the world too lively and ſtriking a proof of the truth of this obſervation;—hence the very name of a <hi>Red-Coat</hi> (pardon the expreſſion) <hi>ſtinks in our no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But bleſſed be the God of heaven, that the gentlemen who now form our militia, in Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, are the Americans themſelves, whoſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters are known to be not ſuch as but juſt now deſcribed; and who we hope, under God, will ſave this country, and of conſequence the Britiſh empire from apparent ruin.</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. Soldiers muſt not <hi>accuſe any falſly</hi>;—this is a certain ſpecies of wickedneſs too common to ſoldiers;—thoſe of them that watched the ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre of our Lord, falſly accuſed his diſciples, <hi>that they came and ſtole his body while they ſlept;</hi> they were hired to tell this lye by government, and what will not poor ignorant, ſottiſh, ſelfiſh, low-liv'd, ill-bred, graceleſs creatures, that have no fear of God at all, do for money?—And I wiſh we may not find that the ſoldiers at Boſton, have ſent no lies home, or falſe accuſations of the brave Provincials—when they gave them ſuch a ſevere drubing in the action of Lexington.</p>
            <p>Laſtly under this head, as the deſign of raiſing armies, is the defence of the people, as ſoon as this is bravely aſſertained, the Chriſtian ſoldier ſhould lay by the ſword, and diſband the army, leſt their exiſtence, when not neceſſary, ſhould
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:013861_0018_0F925498F9EE2B70"/>
occaſion the very miſeries, they were raiſed to avert. A few inferences ſhall now conclude this diſcourſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Our ſubject teaches us deeply to bewail the univerſal depravity of human nature;—O Adam! in what a deplorable condition is thy family now!—what haſt thou done!—how many evil paſſions and appetites rage in the world!—Envy, wrath, malice, diſſimulation, covetouſneſs, pride, brutal luſts, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> whence ariſe thoſe cruſhing woes and calamities of wars, murder, rapine, ſlaughter and deſolations among mankind. How juſt it is for a holy God, as the moral Governor of the world, to puniſh ſuch ſinful guilty crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We learn hence the exceeding innate evil of ſin, if the puniſhment is not inadequate to the offence, which we are not to ſuppoſe; then the offence is very great, becauſe of the great pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment inflicted.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We alſo learn from our ſubject, to admire the care of divine providence over the human race, to continue men on the earth amidſt ſuch deluges of miſeries or deſtruction on every hand. And as civil government, in the hand of divine providence, is ſubſervient here too, we ought to bleſs God for the inſtitution, and ſupport it while government continues to obſerve its original de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign <hi>viz.</hi> the protection of the lives and properties of the people.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We may alſo acknowledge the goodneſs of God, in abridging the life of man, to 70 years, for that is long enough for the wicked to rage, and the righteous to ſuffer—and be abſent from that reſt that God has prepared for his people. How amazing that the Church of Chriſt has not been ſwallowed up, by the united combinations of all the evil—ſpirits of darkneſs, and the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:013861_0019_0F92549A12D332D8"/>
wicked in this world in every age! this is the mighty power of God indeed!</p>
            <p n="5">5. We learn from this ſubject, the ſpecial need our world ſtands in of a SAVIOUR, that by the grace of his holy covenant, according to the great rich divine plan he has revealed in the holy Bible, ſuch ſinful creatures as we are, may be ſanctified and pardoned, and made fit for uſefulneſs in this life, and the enjoyment of God in heaven.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Our ſubject teaches us to be reconciled to the thoughts of death, on the true principles of goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel holineſs, whenever it ſhall pleaſe God to call us hence; as all in this ſinning, teaſing mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſappointing world, as Solomon juſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it, <hi>vanity and vexation of ſpirit;</hi> and yet on the other hand, we muſt not repine at the hand of God, if we are continued long even in a ſtate of affliction;—but ſhould ſay with that old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-ſaint, <hi>all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come:</hi>—It is our great wiſdom and intereſt, to take heed, that we have not with Dives our good things here, but would make the beſt of this preſent life, as a wilderneſs paſſage, through which we would journey to the better country, the heavenly.</p>
            <p n="7">7. We hence learn how much it is our duty to be both frequent, and very fervent in prayer to God, for the ſpiritual kingdom of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which conſiſts ſo much in peace and love, to come with divine power and ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, to check and ſtop thoſe evils that now rage in the world, as it is well known, by long expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that it is the holy ſpirit accompanying a preached goſpel, that is the only ſovereign reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to cure the evils that are in the hearts of men, to qualify them to be real bleſſings to each other, as members of ſociety in this life, and to
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:013861_0020_0F92549AB0A47038"/>
put them in a capacity for communion with the holy Trinity and ſaints and angels in heaven.</p>
            <p n="8">8thly And laſtly, Our ſubject teaches us, how much we ſhould deprecate the calamities of war —eſpecially thoſe of a civil war; the moſt awful of any, if it could be avoided. And O what an awful dark cloud, pregnant with all the horrors of civil war, hangs now over this whole conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent of Britiſh America; and this terrifying thought leads me to cloſe this diſcourſe in two addreſſes.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. To all my hearers in general—you are, in this town, now at eaſe, in the lap of peace and plenty; far from any ſcene of either blood or ſlaughter—in the heart of a rich province, ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in the center of the whole American Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent—you hear of diſtreſs, but you do not yet feel it; and God forbid you ever ſhould, as ſome of your worthy brethren now do in Boſton. But know, my dear hearers, that if you abuſe theſe rich, temporal good things (with which the God of heaven has diſtinguiſhed you) in luxury, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs, Sabbath-breaking, ſwearing, unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, drunkenneſs, worldlineſs, pride and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the ſacred and divine inſtructions of his holy word and ordinances. Your ſins will find you out, and God will viſit you with his chaſtiſing rod for your iniquities. Let all then be exhorted by a ſincere, unfeigned repentance, for paſt ſins and reformation of life and manners, to fly to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt by faith, as a hiding place from the ſtorm, and a covert from the tempeſt—be much in prayer to God, to over-rule theſe unhappy diſturbances for his own glory, and the beſt weal of Zion—pray that they may be brought to a ſpeedy and happy iſſue on the genuine principles of liberty and true religion— pray that the juſt attempts of all America, for
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:013861_0021_0F92549F6B9AE338"/>
theſe great ends, may prove ſucceſsful—guard againſt every thing that has the leaſt or remoteſt tendency, to jar the bleſſed uniſon of the whole American harpſicord, as now ſet to the tune of liberty, by the honourable great artiſts the CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TINENTAL CONGRESS—Let every denomination of Chriſtians treat each other with love and reſpect, as brethren engaged in, and ſtrugling for the one and ſame common cauſe—treat all the officers of civil government in this province with becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing honor and reſpect—ſympathize with your diſtreſſed ſuffering brethren in Boſton, both with your prayers and purſes. Finally, dread nothing that can befall you, ſo ruinous to yourſelves and poſterity in this life, as <hi>ſlavery.</hi> Therefore uſe every lawful means to avert it; ſee then that you moſt heartily accord with whatever may be the final determination of all America agreed to in the CONTINENTAL CONGRESS.</p>
            <p>I now turn myſelf to the Gentlemen of the <hi>Militia,</hi> Officers and Soldiers that appear before me in Church in their UNIFORM.</p>
            <p>By your preſent appearance you declare to the world, that you are nobly willing to riſk your lives and fortunes to ſave your country from <hi>ſlavery</hi>; you are accompanied with the ſincere wiſhes of all good people, for God Almighty to bleſs you, protect and ſucceed you in your brave undertakings.</p>
            <p>Your own improved underſtandings will lead you to apply the ſeveral inſtructions ſuggeſted in this Sermon, relative to your duty as warriors; ſhould we be all ſo unhappy, as that you ſhould be ever called to action on account of the preſent ſtruggles for liberty. In the mean time allow me to require of you, to do your utmoſt to preſerve and maintain the good order and peace of this
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:013861_0022_0F9254A0E46A0968"/>
province inviolate; for it is certain, that nothing next to <hi>ſlavery</hi> is more to be dreaded, than the anarchy and confuſion that will enſue, if proper regard is not paid to the good and wholeſome laws of government. And ſhould we be ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſuch evils, we will, and muſt blame our Militia—for no men have it ſo much in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to keep the peace and good order of ſociety as the gentlemen of the ſword.</p>
            <p>You muſt ſtill continue to revere royalty, and obſerve your allegiance to the King, on the true principles of the conſtitution. Your drawing the ſword now muſt not be againſt the perſon of his Majeſty; but the mal-adminiſtration of his government, by deſigning, miſchief-making mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters. Your preſent appearances muſt then be not of choice, but of neceſſity. While his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty George the third will obſerve his own coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation oath, and the principles of the revolution, for the ſupport of which againſt all Jacobite facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Tory plots of popery, his anceſtors of the illuſtrious line of Brunſwick were placed on the throne of Great-Britain, do you obſerve your allegiance.</p>
            <p>I am happy, that I can with a good conſcience, congratulate you and myſelf this day, on the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty we have, for the juſtice and goodneſs of our cauſe: The angry tools of power who miſlead government, may call us American
<q>rebels, who would throw off all government,—would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent and what not.</q>
—But we can now, with great confidence, appeal to God that that is falſe—we deſire no ſuch things—we deſire to be as we were in the beginning of the preſent unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py reign—we have tried every lawful, peaceable mean in our power—but all in vain!—we would love them if they would ſuffer us—we would be peaceable, obedient, loving ſubjects if they would
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:013861_0023_0F9254A139D9B910"/>
let us; but it would ſeem as if the preſent mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry were determined to cram diſloyalty, and diſobedience down our throats—and then call us all rebels—then confiſcate our country and ſell it, to pay their 140,000,000 of debt, or elſe we know not what they would be at. We do in America all declare ourſelves the ſubjects of King George the third, but we never ſwore allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the Parliament of Great-Britain—or elſe we would have above 500 Kings—they are our fellow ſubjects, choſen by the freeholders of that iſland to legiſlate for them, as our Aſſembly doth for Pennſylvania; but if their preſent claims are admitted, we may give up our Aſſemblies—and our Charters are cyphers!—</p>
            <p>In the cloſe of the laſt war, the King had not in all his dominions ſo many more affectionate ſubjects than the Americans—and by their induſtry and trade with England, the nation roſe to her preſent eminence; and now the very power they helped to give her is retorted on them with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled vengeance and unheard of cruelty—but if they beat down our trading Cities and oppreſs us all they can, we will have our woods and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, for as we are the deſcendants of Britons, <hi>we ſcorn to be ſlaves.</hi>—We are now come to our <hi>ne plus ultra</hi>—the ſword, the laſt argument muſt decide the controverſy. Therefore, you can, GENTLEMEN SOLDIERS, appeal to GOD, for the juſtice of your cauſe, he is the judge of all the earth, and will do right, the final determination of all matters is in his righteous, holy, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hand. When England went to war with France and Spain in the time of laſt reign, they invoked the aids of the God of heaven by faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and prayer—and then government diſcovered no leanings to popery—But now, when they are going to murder and butcher their own children
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:013861_0024_0F9254A2062EA058"/>
in America, that have been ſo obedient, uſeful and affectionate—we do not hear that they aſk counſel of God—but if they do not, let us aſk counſel and aſſiſtance from the God of heaven— he is on our ſide we hope, and if God is on our ſide we need not fear what man can do unto us.</p>
            <p>We have all the true friends of virtue, of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and righteouſneſs on earth on our ſide— we have all the angels of heaven on our ſide—for we have truth and juſtice on our ſide—therefore we have the God of truth and juſtice on our ſide —although for wiſe purpoſes of divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, a good cauſe is permitted to be for a time under a cloud—to try the patience and faith of God's people, that the deliverance may finally appear, as it ever will be God's own work; God will never forſake his own ſide of the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—Courage then! courage my brave American ſoldiers, <hi>if God be for, who can be againſt you?</hi>— Equip yourſelves, and to be equipt for this warfare —put on, Gentlemen, the goſpel armoury—<hi>have your feet ſhod with its preparation</hi>—for your <hi>hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, ſalvation</hi>—for your <hi>ſhield, faith</hi>—and be <hi>girt with truth</hi>—this, Sirs, is a goſpel uniform, that well becomes the Chriſtian ſoldier—and thus go forth in the name of the Lord of hoſts; and may he protect you, bleſs you, and ſucceed your very laudable and grand undertaking, in connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with all the Militia of North-America; and may God grant that out of theſe preſent tumults, diſturbances and commotions, a great and mighty empire may riſe up in this weſtern world, for King Jeſus, as well as a <hi>proteſtant</hi> King built on the ſolid principles of liberty and true religion; and the glory ſhall be given to his holy name, now and for ever more, <hi>Amen.</hi>
