            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ORATION.</head>
            <p>WHATEVER creates love of our country, and obedience to its laws, cannot be unintereſting to Americans. Impreſſed with this ſentiment, we ſhall attempt to ſhew the political importance of Science and Religion, and infer their peculiar neceſſity to the youth of America.</p>
            <p>An ignorant people, blinded by paſſion, and deluded by the intrigues of ambition, are jealous under the freeſt government, and diſcontented under the mildeſt laws. Animated with enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtic frenzy, they hurry into tumult and inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, trample upon law, and ſet civil authority at defiance. Experience, dreadful experience, has deeply engraven the truth of theſe remarks upon the annals of all free governments. Every republic has ſeen and felt the importance of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole circle of ſociety illuminated with the beams of ſcience. Whenever we attain to ſuch an aera, every one, whoſe heart feels the leaſt glow of ſenſibility, muſt kneel, and thank the great Parent of nature that he was born an Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can. When we ſtand upon the eminence of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and ſurvey all the nations that ever ſhone in the ancient or modern worlds; when we exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:033633_0003_0FF7AE5542E6DFC8"/>the complicated principles of their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and trace the cauſes which gradually raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to glory, or ſunk them into obſcurity, we ſhall gaze upon the American Conſtitution with rapture and aſtoniſhment. Viewing it as the immortal monument of genius and wiſdom, as the phaenomenon of the preſent age, we ſhall exclaim, <hi>bleſt,</hi> thrice <hi>bleſt</hi> is America. Bleſt indeed, if ſhe always preſerves her rights unimpaired.</p>
            <p>This cannot be effected by Science alone. Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhews the beauty, majeſty and grandeur of our temple; but public virtue only will guard it from profanation. Imagine that diſſipation, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligacy and corruption, ſhould annihilate all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of character, extinguiſh all public ſpirit, and <hi>if poſſible</hi> all American virtue. How, and by whom, will then be filled thoſe public offices, now ſo dignified with patriotiſm and wiſdom? Will not all elections be carried on by bribery and venality? Will not every office be diſgraced by ambition and depravity? Without public ſupport, will not our Conſtitution dwindle into mere inſignificance? Amid the general ſlumber and inſenſibility, an American Caeſar ſtarts up, unſheaths the ſword of civil war, and deluges our country in blood and deſolation. Thus the throne of deſpotiſm is erected. Heaven avert the blow! Patriotiſm baniſh the thought! If ever this time comes, come with it death! But deſtruction is inevitable, ſhould we degenerate from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of our fathers. Our bark ſails upon a boiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous ocean, convulſed with ſtorms, and if we become inebriated with the poiſonous bowls of ſenſuality, it is inſtantly daſhed to pieces, and we are buried beneath the billows.</p>
            <p>The neceſſity of morality implies the neceſſity
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:033633_0004_0FF7AE58CD3A1BC0"/>of Religion. Without this, in vain ſhould we boaſt of being one of the moſt enlightened nations upon earth. The hand of Science, however, naturally conducts to the altar of Religion. A contemplation of the beauty, harmony and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur pervading the univerſe, ſwells the mind with wonder, and inſenſibly hurries it to the object of all adoration: the wiſeſt men are generally the moſt religious. Religion is the great luminary of America and the world: if extinguiſhed, all morality is extinguiſhed; we are involved in night, and changed into daemons of darkneſs. Atheiſm appears: a horrid monſter, without ſhape, without ſubſtance; black he ſtands as night, fierce as his native hell. See how he tears aſunder all the tender affections of the ſoul. The paſſions ſwell into irreſiſtible torrents, and bear away the props of ſociety. Society becomes an agitated ocean, property a ſhattered bark, and man an exhauſted ſwimmer amid the contending billows. Theſe pictures cannot be called delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the imagination. The aboliſhment of Religion in France, produced ſcenes ſtill more dreadful; ſcenes, the bare thought of which is ſufficient to make the blood of a canibal freeze with horror. Boiling with tyger ferocity, her fanatics plunged the dagger into the hearts of friend, brother, ſon and parent, with the calm ſerenity of a ſmile. Even the tomb afforded no ſanctuary. Society was converted into a charnel houſe, covered with bones and mutilated car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſes. We beheld her priſons echoing with groans, her ſtreets ſwelling with carnage, her rivers reddening with blood, her cities ſinking in flames. Behold that once flouriſhing nation, covered with the funeral pall of deſolation! Did
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:033633_0005_0FF7AE5B56A374B8"/>ſuch horrors ever blacken the hiſtory of the moſt abominable ſuperſtition? But Religion is a ſun, which though it may ſometimes generate the clouds of ſuperſtition, yet ſhines far above them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains all its native ſplendour. Religion expands the ſoul, and warms it with patriotiſm and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal philanthropy. It unnerves the malevolent paſſions, creates and invigorates the ſocial affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and cheriſhes all thoſe noble ſentiments of natural relationſhip, that lay the foundation of political freedom.</p>
            <p>Called by the voice of Religion, Americans, like the children of Iſrael, fled from oppreſſion, and ſettled in a land of ſtrangers. When famine and death ſtared them in the face, heaven inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, ſhielded from danger, and long crowned them with proſperity and happineſs. When we their ſons were falling beneath the ſword of war, the great God of armies gave us a <hi>Joſhua</hi> to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due our foes, and conduct us to victory and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Now, when again threatened with deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the ſame overruling Power has not only preſerved this venerable patriot a ſecond time to head our armies, but has raiſed up a <hi>Solomon</hi> to direct our councils.</p>
            <p>Thus miraculouſly favoured, let our breaſts always glow with piety and devotion to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Arbiter of nations, and Ruler of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe. Then ſhall the trees of Science and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, naturally interweaving their branches, and ſupporting each other, riſe above the clouds, and overſhadow the whole Union. Mild concord ſhall reign, and ſilence the clamour of faction. The hatchet of induſtry, wielded by the ſtrong arm of freedom, ſhall reſound from the ſhores of the Atlantic to the banks of the Miſſiſippi. Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:033633_0006_0FF7AE5CE29516A0"/>ſhall become one great family of brothers, all animated with the ſame virtue, with the ſame patriotiſm, with the ſame irreſiſtible ardour for independence.</p>
            <p>Such, ye <hi>Youth of America,</hi> is the importance of Science and Religion. Soon, alas! too ſoon, will our fathers be tranſlated to the ſtarry man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of their God. Then will be depoſited in our hands the Conſtitution framed by their wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the independence won by their blood. By us alone can the invaluable legacies be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to poſterity. Yes, upon us depend the freedom and happineſs of millions yet unborn. The voice of our fathers, the voice of poſterity, therefore, call upon us always to venerate Science and Religion; and at this awful criſis in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, they exhort us to cling to them, as to the pillars of our political ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Behold! that fell daemon, Atheiſm, iſſues from night and chaos, demoliſhes the government of France, and erects his throne upon its ruins. While he vociferates <hi>liberty</hi> and <hi>equality,</hi> he bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhes the thunderbolts of <hi>deſpotiſm,</hi> and ſtains the charter of freedom with the blood of its mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs. Unſatiated with the ſpoils of one kingdom, with giant ſtrides he encompaſſes Europe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the monuments of art, tramples upon the ſons of Science, tears down the altars of Religion, and deluges the world in blood. The earth trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, the ſky blackens—the monſter approaches, and extends his arms to America. She, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in native innocence, averts with ſcorn his foul embrace, and repoſes her confidence in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and the unanimity of her ſons. The voice of Science and Religion cries, to arms, to arms. Great WASHINGTON leaves the ſhades of retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:033633_0007_0FF7AE5E6CEFD860"/>draws the ſword of death, and points to victory. The indignant ſhades of WARREN and MONTGOMERY ſtart from their tombs, point at the wounds of their country, and cry aloud, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge for our injured rights! My Brothers, ſwear to guard from profanation the altars of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Liberty. Rally with your fathers around the fortreſs of independence, and nobly reſolve to <hi>defend</hi> it—or <hi>die.</hi> Alas! ſhould you fall, your tomb would be the tomb of Science, of Religion, of Liberty, of America, and Man.</p>
