            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

And <hi>English Men</hi> who call themselves <hi>Christians,</hi> have Debauched the miserable <hi>Indians</hi> with it; of which there have been some Tragical Effects.

                  <p>There is a Twofold Drunkenness:</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) A <hi>Drunkenness</hi> which is Metaphotical &amp; <hi>Spiritual,</hi> Isa. 51.21. <hi>O thou that art drunken, but not with wine.</hi> The Jews were in such a c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>se, as Drunken men are wont to be in, by reason of the Wine of Divine Judgment that was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to them. And one may be Drunken with
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001570_0007_0FB3D5159F0062D8"/>
Error and Spiritual Delusion; therefore is it said concerning Mystical <hi>Babylon,</hi> that is <hi>Rome,</hi> That <hi>the Inhabitants of the Earth have been made drunk with the wine of her Fornication,</hi> Rev. 17.2. Antichristian Corrupt Doctrines do as it were intoxicate &amp; inebriate the Souls of them that do imbibe or embrace them: they become Drunkard-like, vertiginous thereby. Also one may be Drunk with Security, Isa. 29.9, 10. <hi>They are drunken but not with wine, they stagger but not with strong drink: for the Lord hath poured cut upon them the spirit of deep Sleep.</hi> Delusion and Security had made them as it were dead Drunk. Some think that that is the Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which the Text speaketh of; for Pride and Security are wont to go together, the one being the cause of the other. <hi>Wo to the Drunkards,</hi> that is (say some) to those that are secure in their Sins, &amp; <hi>settled upon their Lees</hi> in an evil course. No doubt but that this is implied, &amp; partly intended here, but that is not the only nor the principal Evil here aimed at. Therefore,</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) <hi>Drunkenness</hi> is taken in a <hi>Literal,</hi> Proper sense: There is Corporal as well as Spiritual Drunkenness, a Drunkenness which not so much the Soul as the Body is the subject of; and that is it which the Prophet here denounceth Judgment for: Therefore in the latter end of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001570_0008_0FB3D51710A5B030"/>
fruitful Vines, whence they had store of Wine, and they abused that Creature to great Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance. When men abuse their Bodies by <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate drinking,</hi> that's the Sin the Text Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns. Now further; there is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Drunkenness</hi> in the sight of GOD, that is, <hi>when a man doth drink more wine, or of any other inebriating drink, than the Rule alloweth of:</hi> Eph. 5.18. <hi>Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess.</hi> The Apostle mentions Wine, because that was the common drink in those days, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est danger was in respect of that, by reason of the strength and pleasantness thereof: But un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that expression of Wine, all other inebria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting drinks are comprehended. Now if there be any <hi>Excess</hi> in the use thereof, that's <hi>Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>; if there be an inordinate affection or love to strong drink, that's Drunkenness in the sight of Him that trieth the R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ins and searcheth the Hearts. Hence the Apostle speaketh of the <hi>excess of wine,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.3. The Greek word (<hi>Dinophlogia,</hi>) there used noteth an inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate affection and desi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e after Wine. And <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>'s description of a Drunkard, is, that he is <hi>a lover of wine,</hi> Prov. 21.17. Such an one is an habitual Drunkard, and he whose practice is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that inordinate Affection, is actually so: Yea, if a man doth but drink a cup of Wine more than is good for him, he is guilty of this <hi>woful Evil.</hi> As he that eateth more than is
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001570_0009_0FB3D518AC5D44F0"/>
good for him, is guilty of the sin of Gluttony; so he that drinketh to any excess is justly charged with Drunkenness.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is <hi>Drunkenness in the sight of Men.</hi> Sometimes this Evil is so gross and notorious, as that the wholesome Laws of men take hold of it and Punish it; Namely, when a man is so <hi>overcome with wine,</hi> as that he c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Psal. 107.27. <hi>They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits end:</hi> This is palpable Drunkenness. We must know that a man may be deeply and damnably guilty of this Evil in the sight of God, though it should never proceed to those outragious out-breakings, whereby men cannot but observe it.</p>

                  <p>Several things may here be mentioned, as Demonstrations of the Doctrine.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>If we look into the Original &amp; Causes of this
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001570_0010_0FB3D51A50F90050"/>
Sin, we shall see the Evil of it.</hi> It hath no better an Author than the Devil himself, who never was the Author of any good (except acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, besides his intention, &amp; against his will) since he was a Devil. Drink is in it self a good Creature of God, &amp; to be received with thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness; but the abuse of drink is from Satan: The Wine is from God, but the Drunkard is from the Devil; 1 Joh. 3.8. <hi>He that committeth Sin is of the Devil; for the Devil Sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose was the Son of God manifest, that He might destroy the works of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</hi> Therefore he that committeth Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness (for that is Sin) that is, (if in his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary course he commi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It hath also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Cause, as bad, nay worse than the Devil, namely, Sin. It is a Sin, and the Cause of Sin, (as afterwards will be shewed) and also the Effect of Sin. Therefore what a woful Evil is it? That Corrupt Nature which is in sinners, causeth them to become guilty of this Evil; J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Evil needs be, that hath no other Causes but such as these?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The very Light &amp; Law of Nature Condemns this Practice.</hi> Drunkards sin not only against the written Word of God, but against that Light and Law which is written in their Consciences. Now those are woful Transgressions. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle doth aggravate the sins of some, in that <hi>in those things which they know naturally, as bruit Beasts they corrupt themselves,</hi> Jude ver. 10. A Drunkard, tho' he be a bruit Beast, yet he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Naturally that he ought not to Corrupt himself with this vile Practice. If there were no Scripture to Condemn this Evil, yet he hath that within him, a Candle of the Lord in his own Breast, which sheweth him that this is an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquity which the Judge will Punish. Hence even Heathens, that have had nothing but the Ligh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of Nature to guide them, yet have spoken against this Evil, yea, and made severe Laws to Punish it. <hi>Solon</hi> (who is accounted amongst the wisest of the <hi>Grecian Princes</hi>) made it a Law. That if a man in Publick Place should abuse himself with Drink, his Crime should be deemed Capital. If he were Drunken but once, he was Punished with Death for that Transgression: Which I mention not to justify the severity of that Law, but to shew how Odious this detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Evil hath been even to those who had nothing but the Light of Nature &amp; Reason to guide them.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="9" facs="unknown:001570_0012_0FB3D51EAB6FBC58"/>3. <hi>A Drunkard is an Universal Transgressor of the whole Law of God. James</hi> saith, Chap. 2. v. 10. <hi>Whosoever shall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.</hi> We cannot say con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Drunkard, that he keeps the whole Law, or that he offends in one point only; but we must say, that <hi>he is guily of all,</hi> even guilty of the breach of all the Commandments: and that not only as he that breaketh one link in a Chain may be said to break the whole Chain, but he hath broken every link, that is, every Precep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of that Divine Chain of the Royal Law. If the question be, Which of the Commandments is Drunkenness a Transgression of? The answer must be, Not of one alone, but it is a general Violation of the whole Law, &amp; of every Precept therein. The Drunkard is an <hi>Idolater,</hi> for he loveth Drink as he should love God, that is, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, even above Wife &amp; Children, &amp; Name and Estate, and every thing that he hath in this world. And there is <hi>Robbery, Adultery,</hi> nay, <hi>Murther</hi> enwrapped in the bowels of this sin, as afterwards will appear. The Drunkard is a Transgressor against the <hi>First Table</hi> of the Moral Law, in as much as by this Sin he is rendred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to Worship God in any Religious Duty: for <hi>wine taketh away the Heart,</hi> Hos. 4.11. But the Heart must be given to God in every Duty: if he Pray it must be with Understanding; and therefore when th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

what work will he make of it? Should a Vile Sinner dare to appear before God when he is in drink, he would but take the Lord's Name in Vain, and bring Wrath &amp; a Curse upon his own Soul. Some think that <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If his Breath stink, by his being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome with Wine in the nostrils of men, how do his Prayers stink in the Lord's nostrils? Moreover, The Drunkard is a Transgressor of the Rule of <hi>Honesty</hi> as well as of <hi>Piety</hi>; therefore saith the Scripture, <hi>Let us walk honestly, not in drunkenness,</hi> Rom. 13.13. So that the Word of God will bear us out in calling those that deserve the Name of Drunkards, Impious and Dishonest Persons.</p>

There is much Prodigality, Riot, Profuseness in this sin: For thereby <hi>the good Creatures of God are wasted,</hi> which is contrary to the express charge of the Lord Jesus, who hath said, <hi>Let nothing be lost</hi> Joh 6.12. But all that is spent in Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is wofully lost. And this Consideration proveth that a Drunkard is a woful guilty Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture before the Lord, for so are they that take His Name in Vain. It is said in the Third Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, that <hi>God will not hold him guiltless that taketh His Name in Vain</hi>; which doth intimate that such Sinners are exceeding Guilty before the Lord. Now to abuse any of His Creatures, is to take His Name in Vain: In this respect, Drunkenness is a Breach of the Third Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment. It is also a <hi>great waster of Precious Time</hi>: Men have no need to be Prodigal of their <hi>Time</hi>; they have not so much of it: <hi>For what is your Life?

pities that any part of that moment should be lost; yet all is lost that is spent in Rioting and Drunkenness: For that time is lost, which a man cannot give a comfortable account concerning the spending of it unto Jesus Christ at the Last Day. Most certain it is, that all men shall be called to an account in that Solemn Great Day which is at hand, as for all Talents which they have been trusted with, so in special for that great and precious Talent of <hi>Time</hi>: But what answer can be given for the <hi>Time</hi> that hath been consumed in Lewd &amp; Drunken Practices?

Moreover, Their Punishment in another World will not be so great, as of those that have been of a Vicious Conversation; for they shall <hi>Chiefly be Punished at the day of Judgment, who have walked after the Flesh,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.10. And so have all Drunkards done: But then there is a <hi>Christian Sobriety,</hi> even that <hi>Grace of Sobriety,</hi> which the Scripture speaketh of, &amp; which differs as much from that <hi>Moral So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety</hi> that some Heathen excelled in, as the Sun Painted on the Wall cometh short of the Real Sun in the Firmament; the one being only a common, the other a special Grace of the Spirit. <hi>Christian Sobriety</hi> doth proceed from such Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, as no meer <hi>Moralist</hi> was ever acquainted with, &amp;c. <hi>From a Principle of Love to Christ.</hi> When a man out of sincere Love to Christ, &amp; desire to be like Him, doth endeavour to walk even as He walked, that's Christianity, that's an Evidence of the Grace of <hi>Sobriety</hi>: See Gal. 5.22, 23. <hi>The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.</hi> So that amongst the Fruits of the <hi>Spirit, Love</hi> is mentioned first, and <hi>Temperance,</hi> which implieth <hi>Sobriety,</hi> or that Virtue which is contrary to Gluttony &amp; Drunkenness, is last mentioned, as flowing from that Mother-grace of <hi>Love,</hi> which hath many Daughters, whereof <hi>Temperance</hi> or <hi>Sobriety</hi> is one. Also true <hi>Christian Sobriety</hi> is

from <hi>Faith.</hi> Hence <hi>Peter</hi> faith concerning the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, That their Hearts were Purified by Faith,</hi> Act. 15.9. The <hi>Gentiles</hi> were much given to that <hi>defiling sin</hi> of Drunkenness, as the same Apostle elsewhere sheweth, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.3. But by Faith they were taught to see the Evil of that, as well as of other Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, &amp; to <hi>Live Soberly</hi> as becometh the Gospel. Again, <hi>Christian Sobriety</hi> is from that <hi>Grace of Hope</hi>: A Believer hath <hi>Good Hope through Grace,</hi> that he shall be with Christ for ever in Heaven: this hope hath that blessed Effect upon his Heart &amp; Life, as that it causeth him to abstain from all those Practices which are displeasing to the Lord, and to <hi>Purify himself, as He is Pure.</hi> Here now is <hi>Christian Sobriety.</hi> All this may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated to us in that Scripture, 1 Thes. 58. <hi>Let us who are of the day be sober, putting on the breast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate of faith &amp; love, &amp; for an helmet the hope of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> Now this <hi>Christian Sobriety</hi> is that which is especially necessary.

Godly <hi>Sobriety</hi> that doth render Christians fit to Encounter with <hi>Spiritual Adversaries.</hi> And (not to Enlarge further here) by means of this <hi>Sobriety</hi> I am speaking of, Christians are fitted to attend the Duties of their Callings, not only Particular and Civil, but General &amp; Heavenly.

                  <hi>Sinful Temptations?</hi> For a man had better see many Afflictions, than one Sin: Yea, there is more evil in the least Sin, than in any Affliction; Nay, than in all the Everlasting Burnings of the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomless Pit. Therefore they who have been preserved from falling into Sin, have the greatest cause of Thankfulness that may be. I doubt not but that there are many here this Day, that were never guilty of this Sin (at least-wise not in sight of men) in all their Lives: But unto whom are you Beholden for this Preservation, but unto the Preventing Grace of GOD? Will you say that there is a Principle of <hi>Inherent Grace</hi> within you, whereby you have been kept from this, &amp; other the like Enormities? Suppose so, yet that <hi>Principle of Grace</hi> is from God: Neither will <hi>Inherent,</hi> without <hi>Vpholding, Preserving, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting Grace</hi> keep from this, or any other Evil. Tho' its impossible to live in this Sin, where there is true Grace: He that hath the least spark of true Grace in his Heart, it is not possible that he should live in this Sin, yet there may be a falling into it. Therefore Christ has Charged even His own Disciples to take heed of this Sin, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.34 Which sheweth that a true Christian may pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly be overtaken with it. And we read in Scripture of Godly men that have been stained with this Iniquity; As <hi>Noah, Lot, Vriah, &amp;c.</hi> Yea, there is not a Godly man on the Earth, but hath that in his own Heart, which would soon lead
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:001570_0035_0FB3DC911E18E908"/>
him to the Commission of this and all other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations, if God should but leave him a little to himself: Wherefore it was that the Holy Martyr <hi>Bradford,</hi> when he heard of any one that was Guilty of Drunkenness, Uncleanness, or the vilest Wickedness, would smite upon his Breast, and say, <hi>In this Heart of mine is that which would have made me commit the same Evil, if the Grace of God had not prevented.</hi> Oh! Therefore be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Thankful to the God of all Grace. But much more have they cause to be for ever Thankful, who are Mortified unto this Sin: For a man may possibly never Commit this Evil outwardly, and yet the Sin not Mortified in him; it may be he may not have an Opportunity to practise this Iniquity; or fear of Punishment, or Shame may deter him, &amp; yet he is not Mortified to it. This Sin is Mortified, when a man doth forsake and abhor it more than Death or Hell, because God is thereby Offended, &amp; Dishonoured; they that do so shall not Dye, but Live; Rom. 8.13. <hi>If ye live after the Flesh, ye shall a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And time was, when there was not need for Ministers to Preach much against this Sin in <hi>New-England:</hi> Oh! that it were so now. But we may say, as some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Prophet <hi>Oded</hi> spake in another case to the Host of <hi>Israel, You have</hi> (saith he) <hi>Slain your Brethren with arage that reacheth up to Heaven: But are there not with you, even with you, Sins against the Lord your God?</hi> 2 Chron. 28.9, 10. So I say, <hi>This Sin is amongst us, even amongst us also</hi>; Yea, &amp; the Rage of it begins to reach up to Heaven; it crieth for Judgment. It is sad, that ever this <hi>Serpent</hi> should creep over into this Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, where Three-score Years ago he never had had any footing, but now it is come, and I fear will hardly ever out again, altho' it hath already devoured many. If we speak of that which God &amp; Scripture calls <hi>Drunkenness,</hi> Namely, when there is a drinking of Wine or Strong Drink to any Excess, how many are there who have cause to lay their hands upon their mouthes, &amp; to Cry <hi>Guilty</hi> before the Lord? I have heard some say, <hi>That there is more Wine &amp; Strong Drink drunk in this Town, than in most Towns not greater than this in the Christian World.</hi> We may then fear that
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:001570_0037_0FB3DC9417A99E00"/>
there hath been much Excess herein, that any should have cause so to speak or think. And how many are there that must be reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst woful <hi>Drunkards,</hi> that nevertheless do not believe any such thing of themselves? There are that flatter themselves in their Iniquity, and think that they are hardly guilty of this sin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are not wont to be subject to such, worse than Beastly Drunkenness, as not to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to understand what they do or say; when as it may be the reason of it is, because by using themselves to Excess in Drinking, they are able to bear a great deal. Now that's worse than to be meerly Drunken; for it is to be a Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard: One may be Drunken, that is not a Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard; and one may be a Drunkard, that is sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom Drunken. He that abhors the Sin of Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness, yet may be overtaken with it, and so Drunken; But that one Act is not enough to denominate him a Drunkard: And he that loveth to drink Wine to Excess, tho' he should seldom be Overcome thereby, is one of those Drunkards upon whom the <hi>Wo</hi> in the Text doth directly fall. Isa. 5.22. <hi>Wo unto them that are mighty to drink wine, &amp; men of strength to mingle strong drink.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, There are that will make others Drunk: Some have done this out of horrid Profaneness of spirit, &amp; therefore its a delight to them to draw those into this Sin that make any Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Religion. If they can but make a Church-member
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:001570_0038_0FB3DC95A01B48B8"/>
Drunk, then they are glad; which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth a strange degree of Impiety. Others have done this out of Covetousness. There hath been an horrible thing done in this respect: Some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us (who they are the Lord knoweth) out of Covetousness have Sold intoxicating Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors to these poor <hi>Indians,</hi> whose Land we Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, &amp; have made them Drunk therewith. What a fearful Sin is that! The first Fathers in this Colony, who are now the most of them in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, began this Plantation, in part out of respect to the Conversion &amp; Salvation of the Natives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst whom we Live; but what woful Dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy is this, that some should rise up amongst us, that out of love to a little filthy Lucre, shall teach them such Wickedness as before they were never acquainted with? The <hi>Indians</hi> are of themselves the saddest <hi>Spectacles of Misery,</hi> &amp; the most woful <hi>Remembrance of the Ruines of the Righteous &amp; Glorious Image of God,</hi> that ever mortal Eye beheld; but therefore their Sin is not a little aggravated, that shall make such Poor Creatures more the Children of Hell than they were before. If there be any in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation (as I doubt there is) whose Conscience doth accuse him of making others Drunk, let him hear the Word of the Lord which is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, Hab. 2.15, 16. <hi>Wo to him that giveth his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour drink, that puttest thy bottle to him, &amp; makest him drunken also: The cup of the Lord's right hand

shall be turned unto thee.</hi> By these things then it is sadly Evident, that there is cause enough to bear Witness against this Evil.</p>

Do we not see it in <hi>Noah?</hi> He was a Righteous man, &amp; was Drunken but once in all his Life, that we read of; and much might be said to Excuse him, in that probably he knew not that there was an inebriating Quality in Wine, Nevertheless, that Drunkenness bro't a Curse upon one of his Children, which continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to this Day, altho' it be Four Thousand Years since that Sin was Committed.

My <hi>Text</hi> sayes, <hi>Wo to the Drunkards of Ephraim</hi>: Even so, <hi>Wo to the Drunkards of England</hi>; and, <hi>Wo to the Drunkards of Holland.</hi> Is not <hi>Salmanasser</hi> at this Day coming against <hi>the Fat Valleys for this Sin</hi>? And if we look nearer Home; What sad Harvests have we in <hi>New-England</hi> had of late Years? And doubtless the prevailing of this Iniquity hath been One Cause of it: The good Creatures of God have been greatly Abused by many amongst us, unto much <hi>Sensuality</hi> and <hi>Intemperance,</hi> therefore doth the Lord take away Creature-comforts from us. This last Summer, what Excessive Rains have there been? Since that Drunkards are to be seen up &amp; down in almost every Town; no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the Lord in Judgment maketh the <hi>Earth</hi> Drunk. Nay, come yet nearer Home, &amp; look upon this great Town, How hath God Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned us for This, as well as Other Sins? Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the sad Fire that was here in this Part of the Town about Three Years ago<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And where did that Fire break forth? Began it not at the Ale-house? As if the Lord should from Heaven Point with the Finger, and say, Behold, I am Displeased with you, because of your mispending your Precious Time in such Houses. <hi>Boston! Boston!</hi> Take heed of this Sin, lest thou become Desolate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Know, that this Sin will certainly be Bitterness in the Latter End.</hi> Suppose the best that can be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed; Suppose the Lord should give you Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,

&amp; so forgive this Iniquity, yet then it will cost you much Bitterness of Soul. Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary cases must always be excepted; but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, God is not wont to Pardon great Sins, without bringing first to great Sorrows, &amp; heavy Breakings of Heart for them. Now, Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is a great Sin, and therefore conclude thou mayest, that if ever the Lord Pardon it to thee, He will first break all thy Bones &amp; Heart for it: Or if the Sin be not Mourned for, and Turned from, then <hi>bitter Destruction</hi> will be the End of it. The Scripture saith of those <hi>whose God is their Belly,</hi> that their <hi>End will be Destruction,</hi> Phil. 3.19. Now, the Drunkards Belly is his God, unto which he offers a Drink-offering. What bitter &amp; lamentable Ends have many Drunkards come to? Hath not the Lord been wont to make such Persons awful Examples of Divine Vengeance at last? What a sad End did <hi>Nabal</hi> come to, after he had been very <hi>Drunken?</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.36. And what a lamentable End did <hi>Amnon</hi> come to at last, who was Murthered by his own Brother at that very instant <hi>when his Heart was merry with Wine</hi>? 2 Sam. 13.28. And yet he was the Child of a Godly Father, who no doubt had Wept &amp; Prayed for the Salvation of his Children full many a time. And what a lamentable End did <hi>Elah</hi> come to at last? <hi>Whose Servant Zimri con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired against him, as he was in Tirzah drinking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self drunk in the house of Arza, &amp; smote him &amp; killed

him,</hi> 1 King. 16.9, 10. It may be because thou art given to this Sin, God will suffer thee to Dye Drunken at last<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; to go down into Eternal Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in that Condition: Or it may be, God will leave thee to that which is worse than any Death; it may be, some time when thou art Drunk, thou will be left to fall into some horrid Sin, for which the Sword of Justice shall Cut thee off at last. I could produce many direful Instances to this purpose: But I will only mind you of one dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Example, which <hi>Austin</hi> mentions, who saith. That in <hi>Hippo</hi> (the Town where he was Minister) there was a Citizen whose Name was <hi>Cyril,</hi> who had but one only Son, to whom he was extremely Indulgent; and as <hi>Austin</hi> saith, Loved him above God Himself: This Son, as he grew up, fell in with Bad Company, and became a Drunkard, &amp; once coming Home much Distempered with Drink, he attempted to Ravish one of his own Sisters &amp; Killed two other of his own Sisters, &amp; Murthered his own Father that begat him, and his own Mother that bare him, who was then great with Child: For which Monstrous Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ies he was Condemned &amp; Executed. Now say, Was not this Young mans Drunkenness <hi>Bitterness in the Latter End</hi>? For the present, this Iniquity may be Sweet to you; but what <hi>will it be upon a Death-bed,</hi> think you? It may be Conscience will Roar for it then. Some Notorious Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, when they have been upon Death beds,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:001570_0045_0FB3DCA018447E70"/>
have cried out in Hellish horror of heart, <hi>Ale-houses are Hell-houses:</hi> The Ale-house hath bro't my Soul down to the house of Hell for Ever. Shall I tell you what I am able upon my own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Knowledge to testify? I will tell you, that there have been some in this very <hi>Congregation,</hi> who upon Sick-beds &amp; Death-beds have sent for me, desiring that I would Cry to the Lord for them, &amp; give them the best Advice I could for their Souls: Seeing them in miserable distress of Conscience, I have said to them; Tell me now, what is that Sin that doth most of all torment &amp; perplex your Conscience? <hi>O my Company-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp; my Drunkenness,</hi> saith one; and, <hi>O my Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny-keeping, &amp; my Drunkenness,</hi> saith another. These have been the lamentable Cryes of poor dying Sinners in this Place, when they have seen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves upon the borders of Eternity. And after Death this Sin will be bitter indeed: Then (as one speaketh) <hi>the Drunkard for every Cup of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, will receive a Gallon of wo.</hi> Yea, for every Drop of pleasure which he enjoy'd whilst living &amp; sinning, he shall have a Tun of wo. <hi>After Death comes Iudgment,</hi> and then the truth of this will be felt and believed. For,</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Know for certain, that who ever liveth &amp; dieth in this Sin, shall Perish to Eternity.</hi> It will be a folly for any such Sinner to expect Salvation. Can you be Saved without an <hi>Interest</hi> in Christ? This Lust alone, if lov'd or liv'd in, will keep Christ
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:001570_0046_0FB3DCA1985216E8"/>
out of the Soul. It is reported, that a great man once said to <hi>Luther, Sir, we would all willingly be Christians, but we cannot find in our hearts to leave that custom of drinking to Excess.</hi> But a man must leave that Custom, or Die &amp; Perish a Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Sinner for ever. It was partly shewed the last time, That Drunkenness is such an Evil as will assuredly Exclude the Sinner out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: Therefore the Lord hath commanded Churches to Exclude such out of their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; 1 Cor. 5.11. <hi>If any man that is called a Brother, be a Drunkard, with such an one, no, not to eat.</hi> What, a Church-member, and a Drunkard? Ah! Vile: Ah! Vile. Wo to that Church that shall know such amongst them, as make a practice of this Iniquity, and yet not make them to know the Terror of a Censure. How plain &amp; peremptory is that Expression, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 10. Where it is said in so many words, <hi>Drunkards shall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> And if not, it must needs follow, that Hell and Destruction will be the Eternal Portion of every Drunkard, so living, so dying. Wherefore the Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> speaking of Drunkards, yet saith, <hi>Hell hath enlarged her self, and opened her mouth without measure,</hi> Isa. 5.14. Drunkards, Tremble at this! Do you not see Hell gaping for you, and opening her mouth wide to receive your Souls, when once they are out of your Bodies? Yea, verily, tho' a man should reform
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:001570_0047_0FB3DCA318ACE8E8"/>
his Life in many things very much; tho' he should be swept &amp; garnished never so, having at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to great Gifs, practising many Duties, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking many Sins, yet if there be but this one Lust of Drunkenness, which still his Heart hath a secret love and liking to, there is no remedy, but Dying in his present Estate, he must be a Damned Wretch to all Eternity. Oh! That you would think sadly between God and your own Souls, on the words of the Lord Jesus, Mat. 5.29, 30. <hi>If thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, &amp; not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, &amp; cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.</hi> Tho' this Sin of Drunkenness may be as dear to thee as Life and Limbs; tho' it may be as hard to part with, as to pluck out a Right Eye, or to cut off a Right Hand, yet <hi>away with it, away with it,</hi> as ever thou wouldst Escape Hell-fire.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Know, that if any of You that are here before the Lord this day, shall continue under the Guilt of this Sin, Your Iniquity will be hainously Aggravated</hi>: For you call your selves Christians. If an <hi>Indian</hi> be Drunk, that's bad; but for a <hi>Christian</hi> to be a Drunkard, is a thousand times worse. If <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraimites</hi> (that is to say, such as Profess that

they are the Lord's People) be Drunkards, surely the Lord will Judge them as those that break Wedlock, that break Covenant with Him are Judged. Yea, and you Sin in the Day, that is against Gospel-light. What saith the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? 1 Thes. 5.7, 8. <hi>They that be drunken, are drunken in the night: but let us who are of the day, be sober.</hi> For men that live in Gospel-Days, and under Gospel-Ordinances, to practise deeds of Darkness, is shameful and horrible.

Will you be Sinners in <hi>Zion?</hi> Will you be Fools in <hi>Israel</hi>! You have moreover been told of the Judgments following this Transgression; You have been sadly &amp; solemnly Warned against this Evil, and that not in a Word or two; but by <hi>Sermon</hi> after <hi>Sermon.</hi> I remember I had occasion to <hi>Preach a whole Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> that I might Testify against the Sin of Drunkenness in this Place, it is now above Nine Years ago.

<pb n="46" facs="unknown:001570_0049_0FB3DCA6191F3E70"/>
against the same Evil, whereby the Eyes of God's Glory are Provoked, and His Blessed Name is highly Dishonoured amongst us. Take heed how you resist the Spirit of God. I might tell you; that an Author worthy of Credit, Relates that a Minister having Preached a Sermon against Drunkenness, a Profane Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard that was in the Congregation, went out &amp; Scoffed and Mocked at what he had heard; and God smote him by a strange Providence, that he Died forthwith, even whilest he was deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at the Sermon which he had newly heard. Will you Provoke the Lord to Jealousie? Are you stronger than He? But if there be any Drunkards in the Congregation so desperate, as to go on still in the Commission of this Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass against the Lord, be it known to you, That your Blood shall be upon your own Heads. I remember what God said to His Prophet <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel,</hi> Chap. 33. ver. 7, 8. <hi>Son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me. When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak, to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at thine hand.</hi> O Lord, I Tremble to think of that! That the Blood of any Poor Soul shall be Required of me: I trust in Christ that it shall not be so. I trust that none amongst you shall
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:001570_0050_0FB3DCA79A07BA10"/>
be able to say to me, when we shall all appear before the Judgment-seat of Christ, <hi>Had you that Taught us the word of God, told us the evil of our ways, had you faithfully warned us of our danger, we would not have gone on therein.</hi> I remember also what the Lord further saith, Ver. 9. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way, to turn from it: if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity, but thou hast delivered thy soul.</hi> Now then, I call Heaven and Earth to Record against you this Day, that I have Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you of this Sin to turn from it: Let Men &amp; Angels that are here present, bear me witness at the Last Day, that I have not shunned nor spared to declare unto you <hi>the Woes</hi> that will certainly follow upon continuance in this Evil. Therefore if there be any Drunkard that will be a Drunkard still, he shall die in his Iniquity; but I have delivered my Soul.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Let every one Endeavour the Suppression and Extirpation of this Evil.</hi> This we should do, by Labouring to Pray it down. When we are taught to Pray that the <hi>Name of God may be Hallowed,</hi> therein is implied, That we must Pray that this and such like other Evils, whereby His Glorious Name is much dishonoured, may be

suppressed. And there are some that ought to do more than meerly to Pray against it; Ministers must bear Witness against it in their way: And it concerns those that have any Civil Power in their Hands, to bear Witness against it in their way. If there were Magistrates in this Assembly, I would speak to them in His Name <hi>by whom Kings Reign, and Princes decree Iustice, and all the Iudges of the Earth,</hi> and Exhort them to draw forth the Sword of Justice against this Evil.</p>

And if you find out any that have made a Trade of this Iniquity, and that have got part of their Living by the Blood and Destruction of Precious Souls, see that you bring them forth to Condign Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and as they have been Exemplary in Sinning, so let them be brought under Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary Punishment, that <hi>All Israel may Hear, and Fear, and do no more so Wickedly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Much more, <hi>Let every one be Exhorted to beware of being Subject to, or coming any way under the Dominion of this Iniquity.</hi> For Motives, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what was said in the last Use, as also formerly concerning the Wofulness of this Evil. By way of Direction here, I shall only say Two things.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) <hi>Take heed of the Occasions &amp; Temptations leading unto this Evil.</hi> Some there are that will Pray against this Sin, and yet they will cast themselves upon Temptations to it, which is to take God's Name in Vain; Even as if a man should put his hand into the Fire, and then Pray that he might not be Burnt: Would you not say that such a one did Mock the Lord? And what do they do less, who Pray that they
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:001570_0053_0FB3DCAC17356418"/>
may not be Drunk, and yet will not avoid Temptations that lead unto it. As now, <hi>Idleness</hi> is a Temptation leading unto Drunkenness: When Vile Persons have nothing else to do, then they must go to the Tavern, and drink till they be Drunken. <hi>Idleness &amp; fulness of Bread</hi>; so Idleness and fulness of Drink are wont to go together, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.49. Therefore take heed of Idleness, If you would escape Drunkenness. And take heed of <hi>Company-keeping</hi> with those that would draw you unto this Evil: <hi>My Son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not: walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path.</hi> Take the Counsel which the Holy Ghost giveth by <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 23.20. <hi>Be not amongst wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Remember that Scripture, Prov. 13.20. <hi>He that walketh with wise men shall be wise; but a companion of fools shall be destroyed.</hi> And take heed of being more, than you have any just Cause or Call to be, in Places where a Temptation unto this Sin is set before you: Go not to, Tarry not in Taverns or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary's, or in Houses where Strong Drink is Sold, without sufficient reason to bear you out in such a Practice. It is a sad thing, that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors and Church-members should many of
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:001570_0054_0FB3DCAD9F77BD88"/>
them be guilty of Scandalizing the world in this respect. A Carnal Creature Excuseth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, saying, <hi>Why should not I go frequently to the Tavern? Such an one is a Church-member, and I see him there often; such an one is esteemed a Godly Man, and yet I have seen him sit for Hours together there; and why should not I do so as well as be?</hi> Thus doth the abuse of your Lawful Liberty become a Snare, and Ruine to many a poor Soul. Doth not the <hi>Scripture</hi> say, <hi>Look not upon the wine?</hi> Prov. 23.31. The meaning of which is, that men must avoid all Temptations unto Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as much as possibly may be. Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is like the <hi>Basilisk,</hi> of whom they say, That if a man do but look upon it, he is thereby In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and mortally Poisoned. Therefore it will be your wisdom to keep out of the sight of this Evil, and far away from what ever shall tend, and tempt unto it. One thing more I shall mention, as a great Occasion and Cause of this Sin, which therefore you ought to avoid, Namely, that Heathenish Custom of <hi>Health-drinking.</hi> It is an Heathenish, nay an Idolatrous Rite; witness those Ceremonies of putting off the Hat, yea, of Kneeling, (a gesture of Adoration) which are Customary amongst profane Health-drinkers. But the Word of God saith, <hi>Learn not the way of the Heathen; for the Custom of the</hi> [Heathen] <hi>People are Vain,</hi> Jer. 10.2, 3. And that Christians are <hi>Redeemed from
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:001570_0055_0FB3DCAF17BDF120"/>
their vain Conversation received by Tradition from fore-fathers,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.18. What should <hi>Christians</hi> do with the Mysteries and Ceremonies of <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus?</hi> Do not think that only a few Puritan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> or Precisians, have been against this Custom of drinking Healths: For tho' <hi>Papists</hi> indeed Plead for the Lawfulness of it, yet <hi>Protestants</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Condemn it: And the Ancient <hi>Doctors</hi> in the Church have Thundred against this Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; and that because it is (as they were wont to Express it) <hi>A Shoe-ing-horn to draw on Drunkenness</hi>: It is a <hi>Bacchean Artifice,</hi> which Satan hath devised for that end. The <hi>Scripture</hi> likewise doth plainly enough Reprove it, when <hi>Banquettings</hi> are Condemned, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.3. The Greek word (<hi>Potois,</hi>) which is there used, properly noteth a drinking by Number and Measure, as is usual amongst <hi>Health-drinkers.</hi> But especially when any shall be so Vile, as not only to drink Healths themselves, but to force others to do the like, their Practice is very Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Abominable. Is there any in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation that hath done thus, that hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled others to drink Healths, and will you go on to do so still? I <hi>testify</hi> from the Lord against that man, whoever he be, that an Heathen shall rise up in Judgment against him, and Condemn him at the Last Day: Witness else what is Written, <hi>Est.</hi> 1.8. It is there said, <hi>That the drinking was according to the law, none did compel;

               <p n="2">(2.) There is another Rule, which if it be observed, you shall never be under the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of this Iniquity, and if it be neglected, all other Precepts will be in Vain: It is this, <hi>Make sure of an Interest in</hi> JESUS CHRIST, <hi>by Faith unfeigned in His Name.</hi> There are some, that in giving Directions tending to the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of this Sin of <hi>Drunkenness,</hi> say to those that are guilty of it, That they must <hi>Pray,</hi> and add <hi>Fastings</hi> to their <hi>Prayers,</hi> and <hi>Vows</hi> to their <hi>Fastings</hi>; all which things are good, and see that you attend them in their due Order. But alas! The main thing of all is left out, if an <hi>Interest in Christ</hi> be not sought after, and made sure of. All <hi>Prayers, Tears, Resolutions, Fastings,</hi> and <hi>Vows</hi> against this Sin, will never subdue it without CHRIST. Go to <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> for Power against this, and all Corruptions: If thou art once in <hi>Christ,</hi> thou mayest by Faith obtain Power from the Blood of <hi>Christ,</hi> for the Killing of this Sin: If thou art in <hi>Christ,</hi> His Spirit also will Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify it.

How many Guilty, Accusing Consciences are there here before the Lord? Oh!

Think seriously on that Scripture, Rom. 13.11, 12, 13. <hi>Now it is high time to wake out of sleep, the night is far spent, the day is at hand; let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, — Let us walk honestly, not in rioting &amp; d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But I can only say thus much. We read in Scripture of those that have been grievously <hi>Guilty of this Sin, many &amp; many a time</hi>; of such as have <hi>Walked in it,</hi> yet when they have <hi>truly Repented of it,</hi> the Gracious Blessed GOD has <hi>freely Forgiven them</hi>; and in <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> looked upon them as if they had never Committed this Sin. To Encourage to <hi>Repentance,</hi> and to break the <hi>Heart of the Vilest Drunkard,</hi> I'll put you in mind of Two Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: The one is that, 1 Pet. 4.3. <hi>The time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lascivious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquettings, &amp;c.</hi> So that those <hi>Christians</hi> had afore their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version been wofully Guilty of <hi>this Iniquity,</hi> but upon <hi>true Repentance</hi> they were <hi>sprinkled with the Blood of Jesus Christ</hi>; as the beginning of the <hi>Epistle</hi> sheweth: That is to s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Another Scripture to Encourage you to Repentance is that, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. Where the <hi>Apostle</hi> having said to the <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

no Drunkard (that is, so Living and Dying without Repentance) shall inherit the Kingdom of God; he addeth withal, <hi>Such were some of you: But ye are Washed, you are Sanctified, you are Iustified in the Name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi> Know therefore, that altho', thou hast been Guilty of this great Sin, it may be an Hundred &amp; an Hundred times, yet thou mayest be Justified from it in the Name of the Lord Jesus, if indeed thou dost Repent of it. But then your Repentance must be thus Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied;</p>

Do as <hi>David</hi> did, who saith, Psal. 38.18. <hi>I will declare mine Iniquity, I will be sorry for my Sin.</hi> What Sin was that?

               <p n="2">(2) <hi>You must also Forsake this Sin</hi>: That's implied in true Repentance. And I speak this the rather, because I know there have been some Drunkards that would Bewail their Sin with

Thy Heart must be so broken <hi>For</hi> this Sin, as to be broken <hi>From</hi> it; Otherwise tho' a man should Confess his Sin till his Tongue be worn to the stumps, tho' he should Pray against it till Heaven and Earth shake; tho' he should Weep Seas of Tears for it, yet if he will not Forsake it, all his Confessions, Prayers, and Tears shall never Save him.
