            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Candid Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SEEING that Corrupt Principles tend to infect the Heart and Practice, it is therefore highly neceſſary to beware of them; we read of damnable Hereſies, as well as damnable Practices, (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> ii. 1.) Seeing that the main Doctrines of Religion, have, in a Meaſure, the ſame Relation to Piety in Practice, as a Foundation to a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure, it is therefore like building a Fabrick in the Air to inculcate the one without having regard to the other. It is doubtleſs a commanded and Important Duty to be Valiant for the Truth upon the Earth, and to contend for the Faith once deliver'd to the Saints: But how ſhall we be able to comply with this divine Precept, unleſs we know the Truths we are to be Zealous for? And how can we expect to know them without the Uſe of proper Means to that End, ſuch as Reading, Meditation, Prayer?</p>
            <p>We are commanded to <hi>hold faſt the Form of ſound Words,</hi> 2 Tim. i. 13. The original Word <hi>Hypotopoſis,</hi> ſignifies a Scheme or Skeleton. This plainly intends not only the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and Harmony of the great Truths of Religion to and among each other, but the Neceſſity we lie under of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to them; but how ſhall we do this without Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge? To ſuppoſe that we need not know but a few Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and that the Knowledge of many hinders our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Progreſs, is to reflect upon the Wiſdom and Goodneſs
<pb facs="unknown:005500_0003_103967D8ED740C20"/>
of God in revealing ſo many in the Scriptures: And to ſay in other Words that the chief Part of the Scriptures is Vain, or rather Prejudicial to our Souls benefit, which is an aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Poſition! If the Doctrines of the Scriptures need not be known, why have they been reveal'd? Can they be of Service to us without our Knowledge of them; but poſſibly ſome may Object that <hi>Paul</hi> aſſerted, he deſir'd to know nothing among the <hi>Corinthians</hi> but JESUS CHRIST and him crucify'd. I anſwer that Place of Scripture is to be taken comparitively, <hi>viz.</hi> That he deſir'd to know nothing ſo much among them as Chriſt and him crucify'd, he deſir'd to make Chriſt in his Perſon, Natures, Offices, Relations, and Sufferings, together with the Benefits thereby purchas'd, the principal Subject and main Scope of his miniſteral Labours. He deſir'd to make all his Sermons on every Subject tend to promote the Knowledge of CHRIST, Love to him and Faith in him. Neither is it unuſual in Scripture to take abſolute Expreſſions in a comparative Senſe. Thus the Almighty ſayeth, That <hi>he will have Mercy and not Sacrifice, i. e.</hi> rather than Sacrifice. Now if we take the aforeſaid Scripture in another Senſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Paul</hi> deſir'd to know nothing more than the Doctrine of CHRIST'S Crucifixion: This tends to caſt contempt upon the chief Part of the Scriptures and render them vain and uſeleſs. And it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe contrary to the Apoſtles Practice, for he preach'd and wrote by divine Inſpiration many other Truths; and ſurely he may be reaſonably ſuppos'd to know his own Intention beſt.</p>
            <p>It is indeed our Wiſdom and our Duty to proportion the Degree of our Zeal, for the ſeveral Truths of Religion to their reſpective Weight and Place in the Chriſtian Syſtem, but without Knowledge and Judgment this is Impracticable. We are enjoyn'd to continue in the Faith, grounded and
<pb facs="unknown:005500_0004_103967D7493EE5C8"/>
ſettled. <hi>Col.</hi> i. 23. But how can this be expected without the Knowledge of the Doctrines of Faith, can we continue in that which we know not? Surely Ignorance is the Cauſe of Unſteadineſs in the Principles of Religion; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of this, ſome are like <hi>Children toſſed to and fro, and carried about with every Wind of Doctrine, by the Slight of Men and cunning Craftineſs, whereby they lie in wait to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, (Epheſ.</hi> iv. 14.) It is no new Thing for falſe Teachers <hi>by good Words and fair Speaches to deceive the Hearts of the Simple, (Rom.</hi> xvi. 18.) The falſe Apoſtles enſnar'd the <hi>Galatians</hi> by great Shews of Piety and Affection to them, as well as by unjuſt Reflections againſt faithful Miniſters. Gal. iv. 17. <hi>They zealouſly affect you, but not well, yea they would exclude us that you might affect them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surely our Eſtabliſhment in the great Principles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, tends to the Glory of God and our own growth in Goodneſs. This is our Excellency, and indeed it is one great End of the Goſpel Miniſtry. (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> iv. 11,—13.) Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Contrary tends to the Diſhonour of God and our ſelves, and much Mars our Growth in Holineſs: For how can a Plant thrive that is often mov'd? Is it likely that thoſe will glorify God by ſuffering for Truth who know it not? Let us therefore abhor theſe <hi>Popiſh</hi> Principle's, <hi>viz.</hi> That Ignorance is the Mother of Devotion, and that it is our Duty to believe implicitely or ſimply. Surely without Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Mind cannot be good. Acquaintance with the firſt Principles of the Oracles of God enriches the Mind and is a Lamp to the Feet. The Knowledge of divine Truths in their due Series and Connection, much confirms our belief of them, and thereby inflames our Love, and Influences our Practice. To help forward that good Deſign I have been induc'd to offer the following Diſcourſes to publick View; and would entreat the <hi>Reader</hi> to peruſe the whole before he
<pb facs="unknown:005500_0005_103967D59C53BD50"/>
condemns a Part, that ſo he may have an Oppertunity of judging for himſelf whether the Truths therein contain'd do not harmonize among themſelves, and tend to promote the Glory of God as well as the Creatures ſelf Abaſement and eternal Happineſs. And if they be found attended with theſe Characters, are they not worthy of Credit and Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance? Surely the Doctrines of Religion ſhould not be judged of according to the prejudices of our Education or corrupt Byaſſes of Paſſion, but calmly and impartially weighed in the Scales of Scripture and Reaſon. For Truth will not vary according to our Humour: It is therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly our Intereſt to know it, whether we like it or not. In the mean time we ſhould beware of reſting ſatisfy'd with the Doctrinal Knowledge of Truth, without feeling the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious Influence thereof upon Heart and Life, <hi>for ſuch as know their Maſters Will and do it not, muſt expect to be beaten with double ſtripes.</hi> Now that the following Sermons may be bleſſed of the moſt high God, to the equal promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Truth and Holineſs, is the earneſt Deſire and Prayer of thy Servant for CHRIST'S Sake.</p>

            <p>THE Principal Thing in human Actions, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands enquiry and deſerves Attention, is their <hi>Form,</hi> or in other Words, the <hi>Principles</hi> we act from, and <hi>Mark</hi> we aim at in them. Theſe are the Ingredients that do chiefly conſtitute their Goodneſs or Malignity; and theſe that God, who is a Spirit, principally regards; exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Services without the Heart, will not be accepted of by God. (<hi>Gal.</hi> vi. 15.)</p>
            <p>It is much to be lamented, that the generality of Mankind ſeem to be ſatisfied, if the ſurface or matter of their Actions be good, without ſearching into the Spring and Scope of them! But unleſs GOD be principally Eyed in what we do, however ſpecious our Actions may be, we do but bring forth Fruit to ourſelves, and ſo are, with <hi>Ephraim, empty Vines.</hi>

                  </gap>m chiefly in all our Actions, whether Natural, Civil or Religious,</hi> is <hi>the Glory of the moſt high God.</hi> And this indeed is the Point of Truth, which our Text expreſly aſſerts, <hi>Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or whatſoever ye do, do all to the Glory of God.</hi> If Gods Glory ſhould be our main Mark, even in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural

Actions, ſuch as <hi>eating and Drinking;</hi> how much more ſo ſhould it be of our Religious?</p>
            <p>Now the Method I purpoſe to uſe in the Proſecution of this Subject, is as follows, viz.
<list>
                  <item>I. I ſhall endeavour to ſhew, <hi>what are the Kinds and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God's Glory.</hi>

                  </item>
                  <item>III. I purpoſe to ſhew, <hi>how we ſhould Glorify God.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>IV. <hi>Why we ſhould aim at his Glory as our chief Mark in all our Actions.</hi>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I return to the firſt propoſed, which was to ſhew, <hi>the Kinds and Nature of God's Glory.</hi> And here it may be obſerv'd, that the Glory of God is twofold, viz, <hi>Eſſential</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Eſſential Glory of God,</hi> conſiſts (at leaſt principaly) in the infinite eminence of the Supream Being. As Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Praiſe is due to any excellent Good, ſo Glory is due to the moſt eminent; now the higheſt or moſt tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Eminence belongs to God, both on the Account of his Eſſence and Attributes, he alone is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> infinite in all poſſible Excellency, his Perfections are underiv'd, immenſe invariable and eternal: Whereas the excellencies of all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are derived, limited, dependant, variable, and therefore not worthy to be compar'd with the divine Atributes. Now the ſuperior Eminence of the ſupream Being, is the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the divine Glory, for which he deſerves to be eſteem'd and prais'd by his Creatures, and therefore he is call'd <hi>the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Glory;</hi> (Epheſ. 1.17.) <hi>The King of Glory,</hi> (Pſal. 24.8.) <hi>The Lord of Glory,</hi> (Act 7.2.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:005500_0008_103967D0A2F95E80"/>Some Divines are of Opinion,
<q>that to the <hi>eſſential Glory</hi> of God, beſides the infinite Eminence already ſpoken of, two Things concur, namely a <hi>certain brightneſs of that Eminence, together with the Knowledge of it.</hi> To illuſtrate the firſt of theſe, they mention Iſa. 35.2. <hi>The Glory of Lebanon ſhall be given unto it, the Excellency of</hi> Carmel <hi>and</hi> Sharon, <hi>they ſhall ſee the Glory of the Lord, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of our God.</hi> Hence the Son of God is ſaid <hi>to be the Brightneſs of his Fathers Glory,</hi> Heb. 1.3. And hence <hi>the Glory of the Lord is ſaid to ſhine round about the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, at the Time of our Lords Nativity,</hi> Luk. 2.9. And hence it is, the <hi>Almighty is ſaid to dwell in Light, which no Man can approach unto,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.16. Which Brightneſs does not ſo much dazle the Eyes of the Body, (as the Sun doth) as of the Mind; tho' according to the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count we have in Scripture, of ſome extraordinary Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of divine Majeſty, there was ſometimes an outward brightneſs added, to be as it were a ſymbol or Sign of the divine Preſence.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But the other Particular which concurs to the divine Glory, is the Knowledge of his Eminence; hence the Face of God is call'd <hi>the Face of his Glory, Judg.</hi> 24.25. and his Name <hi>is Glorious, Matt.</hi> 6.9. becauſe by the Face and Name, the Majeſty and Eminence of a Thing is known; this Knowledge in the utmoſt Perfection belongs only to God, who on this Account is ſaid <hi>to dwell in Light inacceſſible, which no mortal Eye hath ſeen or can ſee;</hi> nevertheleſs a more imperfect Knowledge thereof by God's Word and Works, happens to Creatures in various Degrees, 1 Cor. 13 12. <hi>Now we ſee thro' a Glaſs darkly, but then Face to Face.</hi>
               </q> But to proceed,</p>
            <p>The <hi>declarative Glory of God conſiſts in the Manifeſtation of the Former,</hi> either <hi>objectively</hi> by God himſelf, in fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing

us with matter for Praiſe, in all the Fruits of his Bounty towards us and others, and particularly by engrav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in legible Characters, the Footſteps of his divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, in his Word and Works, which induce intelligent Beings to Praiſe him; and hence the <hi>Heavens are ſaid to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare God's Glory, and the Earth his handy Work.</hi> God's Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is likewiſe manifeſted by rational Creatures two Ways, namely <hi>actively</hi> and <hi>paſſively. Actively</hi> when with deſign, they admire, adore and extol the divine Perfections, and ſay with the inſpired Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.33. <hi>O the Depth! of the Riches, of the Wiſdom and Knowledge of God, how unſearchable are his Judgments, and his Ways paſt finding out?</hi> The <hi>unſearchableneſs</hi> of the divine <hi>Attributes</hi> deſerves our wonder, and their <hi>divinity</hi> our religious Reverence. God is glorify'd <hi>paſſivly</hi> by intelligent Beings, either with Deſign when they ſuffer patiently and chearfully for Truth and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or without Deſign when they ſuffer for their Sins as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors, ſurely the Glory of God's Juſtice is known by the Judgment which he executeth. I proceed to the.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. Propos'd, which was to ſhew <hi>what is</hi> ſuppos'd <hi>by and</hi> imply'd in, <hi>our aiming at God's Glory, as our higheſt Mark.</hi> And,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. It <hi>ſuppoſes</hi> that intelligent Beings acting as ſuch, deſign ſome End, which induces them to concert and improve ſuch Meaſures as have a direct Tendency to compaſs the End they propoſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. It <hi>ſuppoſes</hi> this, <hi>viz.</hi> That the ends of Actions may be various, yea and lawfully ſo, <hi>viz. Supream</hi> and <hi>Subordinate,</hi> if our higheſt End be right, we are ſafe, altho' with a leſs degree of Love we aim at lower Ends, which are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves lawful; for things that are Subordinate, do not claſh or oppoſe each other, <hi>e. g.</hi> in our natural and civil Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we may aim at our bodily Support and Comfort, if in
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005500_0010_103967CD7340F4D8"/>
the mean Time we make God's Honour our principal Mark, And ſo in our religious Actions we may, yea we ought to aim at our own Salvation as an End, if ſo be, we in the mean Time prefer God's Honour and Glory, to all our Intereſts in this and the other World, it is well.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. It <hi>Suppoſes</hi> this, <hi>viz.</hi> that the laſt End can be but one, of two equal Ends or Marks, neither of them wou'd be the laſt, or Principal. When two Ends unequal in might and Dignity concur, the Laws of Reaſon and Juſtice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a Subordination; namely that the Inferior ſhould give place to the Superior.</p>
            <p>But our aiming at God's Glory in all our Actions, as our higheſt Mark and End, <hi>implies</hi> theſe Things following, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. A <hi>ſaving experimental Knowledge of God.</hi> Untill we have an affecting Heart humbling Knowledge, of the divine Perfections by Faith, we are not diſpos'd to love him aright, and direct our Actions to his Honour: For as the proverb is, <hi>(ignoti nulla capido) after an unknown Thing there is no Deſire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly, A <hi>ſtrong and tranſcendant Love to God,</hi> becauſe of his eſſential Excellency and communicative Goodneſs; as we cannot love God ſupreamly, except we know him, ſo we cannot aim at his Glory as our higheſt End, until we love him with a Superior and tranſcendent reſpect; for our aims and deſires follow our Love, and are proportion'd to the Degrees thereof.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. Our aiming at God's Glory, as our higheſt Mark in all our Actions, <hi>implies our prefering his Honour to all our Intereſts,</hi> whether on Earth or in Heaven, whether of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or Soul. As Love to God follows naturally after the experimental Knowledge of God, (in the manner before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd) ſo our prefering God's Honour to all our Intereſts, follows naturally and neceſſarily after, and flows from that
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005500_0011_103967CB91062F50"/>
Love to God, which is ſupream and tranſcendent in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. If we love God above ourſelves, with all our Souls and Strength as <hi>Jehovah</hi> requires, we ſhall be eaſily induced to prefer his Glory, to all our Intereſts of every Kind. And,</p>
            <p n="4">4thly, It <hi>implies, our referring all we do to God, his Honour and Glory; deſiring more that God ſhould be thereby glorify'd,</hi> then after any benefit accruing to ourſelves. The,</p>
            <p n="3">3d. <hi>Propos'd</hi> comes now to be conſidered, which was to ſhew, <hi>how we ſhould glorify God?</hi> Here I ſhall mention a few out of many Inſtances, that might be enlarged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. <hi>We ſhould glorify God,</hi> by <hi>profeſſing his Truth</hi> before Men, at all Times and in all Places, whatever Contempt and Hardſhips we are expos'd to thereby notwithſtanding, if we are aſham'd of CHRIST and of his <hi>Truths,</hi> in this adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous Generation, we may expect that he will be aſhamed of us, when he comes in the Glory of his Father with the holy Angels. My Dear Brethren, we ſhould be valiant for the Truth upon the Earth, and <hi>contend earneſtly for the Faith once delivered to the Saints.</hi> O let us not betray the ſacred Depoſitum of Truths that is in our Hands, which has been tranſmitted to us, thro' much Expence of the Labour and Blood of our Anceſtors; to adhere firmly to the dear and precious <hi>Truths</hi> of CHRIST in the Time of a Tempeſt, when many <hi>make Ship-wreck of the Doctrines of Faith, and a good Conſcience,</hi> and are like fooliſh Children <hi>toſs'd about with every wind of Doctrine, by the Craft of thoſe that lye in wait to deceive,</hi> is truly Noble, and reflects Glory and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour upon God and Religion.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. <hi>We ſhould glorify God</hi> by <hi>confeſſing our Sins</hi> agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to <hi>Joſhua's</hi> Council to <hi>Achan,</hi> Joſh. 7.19. by this we Acknowledge, and thereby Honour God's <hi>Juſtice, Holineſs,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005500_0012_103967C9C9C44A38"/>
Truth, Omniſcience.</hi>—By this we own that God knows one ſecret Sins and might juſtly damn us for them, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. <hi>We ſhould glorify God,</hi> by a <hi>Strong Superlative and paſſionate Love to him,</hi> above all others, with devout <hi>Aſaph,</hi> Pſalm 73.25. <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? and there is none upon Earth that I deſire beſides thee!</hi> And,</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. <hi>We ſhould glorify God,</hi> by a <hi>firm Faith and Hope in the Word of his Promiſe,</hi> with bleſſed <hi>Abram,</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the moſt dark and contrary Aſpects of divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Rom. 4.18.20. <hi>Who againſt Hope believed in Hope, —He ſtaggered not at the Promiſe of God thro' unbelief, but was ſtrong in Faith giving Glory to God.</hi> And,</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. <hi>We ſhould glorify God, by obedience to Gods command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diſpoſing Will;</hi> to the firſt <hi>actively,</hi> and to the latter <hi>paſſively.</hi> Now our Obedience ſhould be <hi>humble, thankful, chearful, charitable, fruitful, heavenly;</hi> with <hi>Abram,</hi> we ſhould ever look upon our ſelves, <hi>to be leſs than the Leaſt of all God's Mercy's,</hi> and with <hi>Paul</hi> far <hi>leſs then the leaſt of all Saints:</hi> When God gives us the comfort of Mercies, we ſhould give to God the Glory of them; with the Man who was healed of his Leproſie, who we are told. Luk. 7.15. <hi>turned back and glorified God;</hi> with the Treaſurer of the Queen of <hi>Candace,</hi> we ſhould <hi>go on in our Way rejoicing.</hi> And does not <hi>Solomon</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us, that our Obedience ſhould be attended with Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Prov. 3.9. <hi>Honour the Lord with thy Subſtance, and with the firſt Fruits of all thine Increaſe; ſo ſhall thy Barns be fill'd with Plenty, and thy Preſſes burſt out with new Wine.</hi> And does not our Lord inform us, that herein is his Father glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, <hi>that we bring forth much Fruit,</hi> Joh. 15.8. By a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and heavenlineſs of Converſation becoming the Goſpel, God is much glorify'd! 1 Peter 2.12. <hi>Having your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation honeſt among the Gentiles, that whereas they ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you as evil Doers, they may by your good Works which
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005500_0013_103967C8492C01D8"/>
they ſhall behold; glorify God in the Day of Viſitation.</hi> Mat. 5.16. <hi>Let your Light ſo ſhine before Men, that they may ſee your good Works and glorify your Father which is in Heaven.</hi> And it is likewiſe much to the Honour of God, when thoſe that profeſs his Name, chuſe rather to ſuffer then Sin. 1 Peter 4.14. <hi>If ye be reproached for the Name of Chriſt, happy are ye, for the Spirit of Glory and of God reſteth upon you; on their Part he is Evil ſpoken of, but on your part he is glorifi'd.</hi> I now proceed to the,</p>
            <p n="4">4th. Propos'd, which was to ſhew, <hi>why we ſhould aim at the Glory of God as our chief Mark in all our</hi> Actions?</p>
            <p>It is true eternal Salvation, or our enjoying God (which <hi>ſuppoſes our Propriety in, or rightful claim to God as ours;</hi> and <hi>implies our Communion with him here imperfectly, and in the Life to come perfectly</hi>) is a great Motive of religious Obedience, the Expectation thereof ſhould doubtleſs influence and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite us in the Service of God.</p>
            <p>And moſt certainly there is a <hi>Connection between glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and enjoying God,</hi> ſo that he who rightly performs the former, is not like to miſs the latter. Pſa. 50 23. <hi>Whoſe offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Praiſe glorifieth me: And to him that ordereth his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation aright, will I ſhew the Salvation of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>enjoying of God</hi> may be likewiſe <hi>call'd an End,</hi> and that properly, (but a Subordinate one) which we may and ought to aim at in our religious Obedience. And it is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs an End, the Higheſt in its Kind, and next, in Order, Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Importance, to that of the Glory of God. On this Account the venerable Aſſembly at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> in their <hi>larger Catechiſm,</hi> call it <hi>the higheſt End of Man;</hi> it is certainly that, which intelligent Beings ſhould ſeek after, next to the divine Glory. The Aſſembly did not deſign to put the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Ends upon a Par or equal Balance, by their Anſwer to the firſt Queſtion in their Catechiſms, in which they are
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005500_0014_103967C6A10A5FC0"/>
both mention'd together; No, by no means, they intend only to repreſent the Connection ſubſiſting between them, as well as their infinite Moment and Importance, and the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in which we ſhould ſeek after them; which is evident from their different Manner of wording them, the Order in which they place them, and the Scriptures they bring for the Confirmation of what they offer upon this Head. In the Larger Catechiſm the Queſtion is worded thus, <hi>What is the chief and higheſt End of Man. God's Glory</hi> they ſignify by their Anſwer, <hi>is the chief End of Man;</hi> and enjoying God fully, the higheſt End, <hi>i. e.</hi> (as has been before obſerv'd) of its kind, next to the other: Their giving the Glory of God the firſt Place in their Anſwer, ſhews that they prefer it in point of Dignity to the other, altho' thoſe Ends are <hi>inſeparably connected together,</hi> (in the Manner before mention'd) <hi>yet</hi> they are <hi>realy</hi> diſtinguiſhed: It is one Thing to aim at Gods Honour, and another to aim at our own Comfort, as the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid Ends are diſtinguiſh'd realy; for one may aim at his own Comfort, and have no true regard to Gods Glory at all, therefore they cannot be both Supream; but one muſt be Chief and the other Subordinate or refer'd to it.</p>
            <p>Now that the Glory of God is the cheif End (above all others) at which we ſhould aim in the whole Courſe of all our Actions, will appear by the following Arguments, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. It is but reaſonable that that End, for which Man and all the other Works of God were principally made, ſhould be Mans chief End: But the End for which Man and all the other Works of God were principally made, was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Glory of God, as the ſacred Scriptures expreſly teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy. See <hi>Prov.</hi> xvi. iv. <hi>Rev.</hi> iv. xi. <hi>Rom.</hi> xi. xxxvi. Surely <hi>Jehovah</hi> is the beſt Judge of the End, for which he has made his Creatures, and to which he has adapted them, ſeeing his Underſtanding is infinite.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:005500_0015_103967C51CDF2CA0"/>2dly. That which God commands us to aim at prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, and proſecute unweariedly, is doubtleſs the chief End of our Actions; but that is the Glory of God, as the Words of our Text and other Places of Scripture do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt. <hi>Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or whatſoever ye do, do all to the Glory of God.</hi> See 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> iv. 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> xi. 26. God's Authority of commanding his Creatures, is founded upon the ſtrongeſt Claims of Right; namely, <hi>creating, redeeming, protecting and providing Goodneſs.</hi> (See <hi>Pſ.</hi> ciii. 3. <hi>Pſ.</hi> lxvi. 89. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. 19, 20.) <hi>Jehovah</hi> has an abſolute Controle over us, becauſe we are the Product of his Power, and Monuments of his Mercy; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we cannot without equal Injuſtice and Ingratitude, diſpute his commanding Authority.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. That which the Saints of the old and new Teſtament principally deſir'd, is the laſt End of acting (by right) but this the Scriptures inform us, was the Glory of God, by the following Inſtances or Examples, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi> who was willing rather to be blotted out of the Book that God had written, <hi>than that Iſrael ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</hi> (<hi>Ex.</hi> xxxii. 12, 32.) and the Reaſon was becauſe God's Name would have been reproached among the Heathen, by their Deſtruction as he himſelf elſewhere ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves. How much was the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> occupied in extolling the divine Praiſe and Glory, and exciting others thereto? Yea ſuch was the Flame of his Devotion, that he even ſummons'd the inanimate Creation to conſpire in celebrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the divine Honour! How memorable likewiſe to the ſame Purpoſe are the Words of <hi>Aſaph Pſ.</hi> lxxiii. 25. <hi>Who have I in Heaven but thee, or on Earth that I deſire beſides thee?</hi> In thoſe Words it appears that he preferred God himſelf, and by conſequence his Glory to Heaven and the Comforts of it! <hi>Nehemiah, Jehoſophat,</hi> and <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:005500_0016_103967C34D5982D0"/>
alſo expreſs a generous and paſſionate ſolicitude reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Name and Glory of God, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> i. 11. <hi>Be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to the Prayer of thy Servants, who deſire to fear thy Name. What wilt thou do unto thy great Name ſaid</hi> Jehoſaphat? <hi>I have been jealous for the Lord God of Hoſts, ſaid</hi> Elijah! 1 <hi>Kings</hi> xix. 10. How emphatical and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are the Words of <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> ix. 3. <hi>For I could wiſh that my ſelf were accurſed from CHRIST, for my Brethren my Kinſmen according to the Fleſh.</hi> I may add the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of all the Saints of the firſt Age of the Goſpel Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, <hi>who lived not to themſelves, but to Chriſt who dyed for them!</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 25.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. That which all other Ends ſerve as Means, muſt needs be the chief and laſt End; but this is the very Caſe in reſpect of the Glory of God, <hi>our Election, Remiſſion, Adoption, Redemption, Sanctification, Salvation, &amp;c. is to the Praiſe of God's Glory,</hi> Epheſ. i. 3, 4, 5,— 12.</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. That which hath an after End, is not the laſt and chief it ſelf, but our enjoying God hath an after End, namely, his <hi>Glory,</hi> and therefore it is not the laſt and chief. (See 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> i. 3. <hi>Rev.</hi> xix. 5.)</p>
            <p>Seeing that the great God himſelf is the beſt of Beings, and is ſelf exiſtent, it is therefore neceſſary, that he ſhould be his own laſt End, for it would be abſurd for him to aim at any Thing below himſelf, or his own Glory as his chief End; but all Things beſides him are below him, and therefore cannot be his principal Mark.</p>
            <p n="6">6thly. That which is the beſt Good, ought to be the laſt and chief End of our Actions; it is contrary to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to make a leſs Good our laſt End: For that would be to prefer, a leſs to a greater Good. Now that the Glory of God is the beſt Good, appears evidently from the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty's making it the chief End of all his Works. To
<pb n="14"
                   facs="unknown:005500_0017_103967C18380F900"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſay that <hi>Jehovah</hi> did not chooſe the beſt Good for his principal End, would be to charge infinite Wiſdom with Folly in his Councils and Conduct, which is as ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous as it is blaſphemous! The divine Glory appears like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be the beſt Good, becauſe of its near Relation, to the beſt of Beings.</p>
            <p n="7">7thly. <hi>He who brings forth Fruit chiefly to himſelf, is an empty and baren Vine, Hoſ.</hi> x. 1. <hi>Zec.</hi> vii. 5, 6. <hi>When ye faſted,—did ye at all faſt unto me? When ye did eat and drink—did not ye eat for your ſelves and drink for your ſelves?</hi> Now he who in ſerving God aims at the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, as it reſpects himſelf, above the Glory of God, he brings forth Fruit to himſelf, and not to God: For he aims at himſelf chiefly, and not at <hi>Jehovah.</hi> Neither does the different Kind of the Benefit, alter the Caſe; for both temporal and eternal Benefits, as they reſpect us under the Notion of a laſt End, are of the ſame Kind, and do differ but in degree.</p>
            <p n="8">8thly. If we ought to love God above our ſelves, than we ought to prefer his Glory to our Happineſs, for Love when it is ſupream, includes both the chief Eſteem and Proſecution in Affection and Practice. (See <hi>Cant.</hi> v. 10. <hi>Phil.</hi> iii. 7, 8. <hi>Pſ.</hi> lxxiii. 25, 84. <hi>Pſ.</hi> ii.) But it is evident, that we ought to love God above our ſelves, from thoſe Words of CHRIST, <hi>Mark,</hi> xii. 30.31. in which is explain'd, the Scope and Subſtance of the firſt Table of the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, or ten Commandments; there we are enjoyn'd <hi>to love God with all our Heart, Soul and Strength, and our Neighbour as our ſelves.</hi> Therefore the Conſequence is plain and certain, that we ſhould prefer God's Glory to our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs conſider'd, ſtrictly and ſubjectively, as a Comfort that reſpects us.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:005500_0018_103967C001D953E0"/>9thly. To prefer our ſelves to God, is ſomething very like to Blaſphemy and Idolatry; but to make our <hi>ſubjective</hi> Happineſs our chief End, and the Glory of God but as a Mean tending to obtain it, is to prefer our ſelves to God. As appears thus, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God as he is the firſt and beſt Being and Cauſe of all the reſt, merits the firſt Honours of his Creatures, by a two fold irrefragable Right; not only in reſpect of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick Dignity or inward Worth of his ineffably glorious Eſſence, but alſo in reſpect of his almighty Efficiency, and communicative Goodneſs towards his Creatures, now that which we make the laſt and chief End of our Actions, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it we confer the firſt Honours. Becauſe by this Inſtance, we declare it to be the chief Good in our eſteem! Now if we make the enjoying of God, or our <hi>ſubjective</hi> Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the laſt End of our Actions, we aſcribe the Honours which only and eſſentially belong to God to our ſelves, becauſe we attribute them to theſe Things that are ours, and as they are ours; contrary to the expreſs Declarations of God. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> xxviii. <hi>Iſa.</hi> xlviii. 11. The Almighty aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us in the forementioned Scripture, <hi>that he will not give his Glory to another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What can <hi>Jehovah</hi> expect of us, but to be glorified by us which conſiſts in an internal Eſteem, and external Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of that infinite and ſupream Excellency, which reſults from all his venerable Attributes!</p>
            <p>And now what is ſpiritual Idolatry, but the inward gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of this ſupream Eſteem, Veneration and Love, either to other Creatures or to our ſelves? And what is Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, but the denial of ſome eſſential Attribute or Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God? either by our Mind Speech or Practice, or an aſcribing to the divine Nature, ſome Imperfection, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to its eſſential Perfection? Now when we make our
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005500_0019_103967BE4EB722B8"/>
               <hi>ſubjective</hi> Happineſs our laſt End, do we not give that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Love to our ſelves, which is due to God only?</p>
            <p>To be the chief Good is an eſſential Attribute of God, now when we eſteem any Thing beſides God, or his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to be the chief Good, and proſecute it as ſuch, do we not implicitly deny the aforeſaid Attribute? And when we propoſe the divine Glory, only as a Mean to obtain another Good which we ſuppoſe to be ſupream; do we not make it, and by conſequence God himſelf, (in our Opinion) a leſs Good? and ſo aſcribe to him an Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, contrary to the eſſential Perfection, and tranſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Eminence of his Nature.</p>
            <p>Is it not a Maxim every where acknowledged, that the laſt End is better than all the Means, which tend to it; and that their Goodneſs both in reſpect of Kind and Degree, conſiſts principally in a certain Relation to the End, and ſuitableneſs to attain it. And therefore when we make our <hi>ſubjective</hi> Happineſs our laſt and chief End we judge it better than the Glory of God, and ſo prefer it thereto, in Opinion and Practice; now if we prefer our Things, (conſider'd as ſuch) to the Things that are Gods, conſequently we prefer our ſelves to God, which is a horrible Evil, contrary to the two firſt Precepts of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law.</p>
            <p n="10">10thly. If our Happineſs conſider'd <hi>ſtrictly</hi> and <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively,</hi> (as a Good or Comfort reſpecting us) ought to be the laſt End of all our Actions, then nothing is ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, is either requir'd or found in the whole Buſineſs of Religion. The Reaſon of the Conſequence is this, Nature is ſo prone to ſelf Intereſt, that it needs not a foreign Aid to excite or aſſiſt it in this Purſuit. Surely that which is agreeable to corrupt Nature, is not above it, and does not Scripture as well as ſad Experience teſtify, that <hi>ſelf ſeeking</hi>
               <pb n="17"
                   facs="unknown:005500_0020_103967BC4964C130"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
is agreeable to Nature, is not this the Cry of thoſe, who are in that State? <hi>Pſ.</hi> xlvi. <hi>Who ſhall ſhew us any Good, Phil.</hi> ii. 2. <hi>All Men ſeek their own Things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Deſire of Happineſs is certainly inate in, and co-natural to all, altho' many purſue wrong Meaſures to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it; vainly imagining, that it is placed in the Honours, Profits or Pleaſures of this uncertain Life! But this Error of the Judgment may be corrected by the Light of Reaſon, eſpecially when aſſiſted by external Revelation, ſo that Men may with more Decency ſeek their Happineſs, that is themſelves, by the external Performance of religious Duty, chiefly upon their own Account. What is neceſſary here, but the Light and Strength of Nature, but natural Pride and ſelf Love? According to this Scheme, where is there any ſupream Love to the divine Majeſty, where is there any Thing truly great, ingenuous, and ſupernatural in the whole Buſineſs of Religion? But on the contrary to love God, with our whole Soul whom we naturally hate, and intend his Glory above our own Happineſs, is both againſt and above Nature, until it be renewed by ſupernatural Light and Grace! Here indeed is ſomething truly great, good, ingenuous, and ſupernatural. For this the Infuſion of a Principle of divine Life into the Souls of the Elect, is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary, and to this indeed it bends freely (for the moſt part) of its own accord, as Streams from a living Spring. This divine Life inclines ſuch as are Saints indeed, to live to CHRIST, and not to themſelves.</p>
            <p>The Scriptures poſitively and frequently aſſert that there is ſomething ſupernatural in Religion! (<hi>John</hi> vi. 44. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> i. 19. ii. 10. <hi>John</hi> iii. 3.) and to deny it, is to deny the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and Soul of Piety altogether, and to leave nothing but a ſelfiſh Husk, an empty Shadow, a dead Carcaſe in the Room of it! Again, another Argument may be this, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:005500_0021_103967BAA0986BE0"/>
To love Pleaſures more than God, is certainly ſinful, but to make our <hi>ſubjective</hi> Happineſs our laſt End, and not the Glory of God, is to love our Pleaſures more than God; and therefore it is ſinful. (See 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> iii. 4. <hi>Mark.</hi> xii. 30, 31.) But to proceed,</p>
            <p>Another Argument may be this, that which takes away the chief inward Differences, between <hi>Sincerity</hi> and <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy,</hi> is a falſe Doctrine; but the making of our <hi>ſubjective</hi> Happineſs the chief End of our Actions does ſo, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears thus. There are ſurely ſome Differences between <hi>Hypocriſy</hi> and <hi>Sincerity,</hi> otherwiſe we would not be ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently exhorted in Scripture <hi>to examine and prove ourſelves,</hi> but theſe Differences are principally found in the fountains of Action: For as to the external Form, who can go far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than a <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> now if there be no Difference in the Roots of Action, where are we? How can we know our State? are we not exhorted to impoſſible Things? And without the Knowledge of our State towards God, how can we attain a true and reaſonable Peace? But the merciful Lord JESUS, has left <hi>Peace</hi> as a Legacy to his Diſciples; and <hi>Marks</hi> of <hi>Sincerity,</hi> among which this is one, <hi>viz. That the Love of CHRIST conſtrains his People.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 14. and this Love is with the whole Heart, as was prov'd before.</p>
            <p>One Argument more may be mentioned under this Head, and it is this, <hi>viz.</hi> If all Things are from God, and by God, and to God, then Man's <hi>ſubjective</hi> Happineſs is not his laſt End, but the Caſe is really ſo, (<hi>Rom.</hi> xi. <hi>and laſt ver.</hi>) The Reaſon of the Conſequence is this, our Salvation is one, among other Things, which are deriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from God, and therefore by a parity of Reaſon ſhould be referred to him, or which is the ſame to his Glory. God is the cauſe efficient, directing, and final of all Things, and eſpecially of thoſe, which relate to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005500_0022_103967B9019F63D8"/>
concerning which the Apoſtle diſcourſes in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited Place. If all Things are derived from God as a Cauſe <hi>efficient,</hi> and are diſpos'd by him as a Cauſe <hi>directing,</hi> it is but highly reaſonable, that they ſhould be referr'd to him as a Cauſe <hi>final,</hi> namely, that they ſhould be to him and for him, from whom they have borrow'd their original; and this is no other than a natural, rational, and neceſſary Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>The Rivers return again to the Ocean, theſe Waters which they have received from it, Ecleſ.</hi> i. 7. moſt certainly to do <hi>all Things to the glory of God,</hi> is to turn Neceſſity into Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, for that ſhall be the <hi>final</hi> Event of all, whether we will or nill.</p>
            <p>It is needleſs to add, that our Lord JESUS has taught the Doctrine, I have been labouring to eſtabliſh, by the Order of that Pattern of Prayer, which he has left for our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and Imitation.</p>
            <p>To the Arguments that have been already offered, I ſhall add ſome <hi>abſurd Conſequences of the contrary Opinion,</hi> And</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. One <hi>abſurd Conſequence</hi> thereof is this, that it <hi>deſtroys entirely what it pretends to eſtabliſh,</hi> namely, <hi>the Happineſs of Mankind;</hi> as appears thus, without a Conformity of our Wills to God, it is impoſſible to be happy in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of him, <hi>for two cannot walk together except they be agreed. Without Harmony, there is no Happineſs,</hi> now where chief Ends are different, this cannot poſſibly be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. Different chief Ends are contrary to each other, they have no Subordination, otherwiſe they can't be chief, and having no Subordination, they muſt needs be oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, and being oppoſite, the whole Train of Means, or ſubordinate Ends, that have a Relation to them reſpective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, cannot but be contrary! And thus it is in the preſent Caſe, according to the Opinion I oppoſe: For hereby God is ſuppos'd, to aim at himſelf or his own Glory as his chief
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005500_0023_103967B77B999D38"/>
End, and to this all his Councils and Actings have a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Reference: On the contrary Man is ſuppos'd to aim at himſelf, or or his Happineſs (ſtrictly and <hi>ſubjectively</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd) as his chief End, and to this all his Conſultations and Actions have a principal Reference. Now here are two Beings, an uncreated and a created, ſet in a dreadful Oppoſition to each other, purſuing contrary Ends, having no acknowledged Dependance upon each other!</p>
            <p>For the bleſſed God to aim at himſelf, or his own Glory chiefly, ſeeing every Thing elſe is infinitely beneath his Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is juſt and reaſonable. But for an inferior Animal who has borrow'd his Being, his Breath, and all his Benefits from the Almighty Power, and unexcited Goodneſs of God! to forget the Rock out of which he was hewn, and reject his Dependance upon, and Subordination to his great Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, good Redeemer and liberal Benefactor, in his Aims and Actings, and ſet up for himſelf in Oppoſition to the Supream Majeſty, is as unreaſonable as ungrateful, as unjuſt as cruel, a Monſter of complicated Wickedneſs, too big to be expreſs'd by a human Tongue, and not to be thought of without extream Abhorrence!</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Van Maſtricht</hi> juſtly deſcribes the Will of God thus, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That it is nothing elſe, but his moſt wiſe Propenſion to himſelf, as his higheſt End, and to his Creatures for himſelf as Means.</q> Now the Creatures Will, according to the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion I am oppoſing, is directly contrary, being propenſe to themſelves or their Happineſs as their chief End, and to God and his Glory only for themſelves as a Mean. Now inaſmuch as God is a ſimple Being, his will is himſelf, and therefore the Nature or Attributes of God are contrary to ſuch, as ſeek and ſerve him chiefly for their own Sakes! And how then can they behold, or enjoy him with Pleaſure? Nay, on the contrary it muſt needs fill them with Horror,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:005500_0024_1039640F92B4D180"/>
to behold all the divine Attributes contrary to them, and therefore engag'd againſt them to deſtroy them! And pray how can they enjoy him, whoſe being is ſo oppoſite to them? Does not Pleaſure ſpring from the ſuitableneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Object and Faculty, and Enjoyment neceſſarily ſuppoſe Harmony and Complacence? And how can this be without an Agreement between God and the Creature, in reſpect of their principal Aims? To ſpeak with Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, what Complacency (can it be with Reaſon ſuppos'd) the Almighty ſhould take, in a Creature who makes itſelf its chief <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, and ſubjects his Glory to its Intereſts, and thus graſps at his Crown and Dignity, and ſets up its ſelf as his Rival and Competitor! But a</p>
            <p n="2">2d. <hi>Abſurdity</hi> which follows from the contrary Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is this, <hi>viz.</hi> that Man <hi>propoſes</hi> to himſelf, <hi>and purſues a leſſer Good, as his laſt End!</hi> Here I ſpeak of Happineſs abſtractly, and for Arguments ſake ſuppoſe it attainable, according to the contrary Notion. That the Happineſs of Creatures is a leſſer Good, than God's Glory is evident from God's propoſing the Latter as his chief End, in all his Works; to ſay that he propos'd a leſſer Good, as his higheſt End, would reflect Diſhonour upon his infinite and unerring Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. If therefore the Gory of God be the greateſt Good; it is an Argument of great Folly and Weakneſs, to propoſe a leſs, as our laſt End! If it be <hi>objected,</hi> that tho' God's Glory be the greateſt good <hi>abſolutely,</hi> yet that it is not ſo relatively; I anſwer it is the greateſt Good even <hi>relatively</hi> for the following Reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Becauſe our Happineſs is inſeperably connected with our ſeeking it in the firſt Place, and higheſt Degree by divine Appointment.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is a great Ingredient in Happineſs it ſelf. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſecure Happineſs, (ſo far as I ſee) but in this Way;
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:005500_0025_103967B5B346B968"/>
we cannot love God as we ought, prefer him to our ſelves, or be ſincerely ſubject to his Sovereignty; and without theſe Things, we cannot reaſonably expect to come to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of God. A</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Abſurdity</hi> is this, if glorifying God or the Glory of God, be but a Mean appointed to bring Men to Happineſs as their laſt End, then when this is obtain'd perfectly, the Mean conducing to it ceaſes of its own Accord; ſo that at this Rate there will be no glorifying God in Heaven; but this Conſequence is directly contrary to the Holy Scriptures, See 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.10. He will come <hi>to be glorified in his Saints.</hi> And are not the Heavenly Hoſts ſaid <hi>to caſt their Crowns at the Redeemers Feet?</hi> A</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Abſurdity</hi> is this, that the <hi>Notion of Happineſs</hi> (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd ſtrictly and <hi>ſubjectively) being the chief End of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Actions, deſtroys Self-denyal,</hi> one of the Terms of the glorious Goſpel, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.24. theſe Words of Chriſt <hi>(apar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſaſthò eauton)</hi> deny himſelf, ſignifies a Total or univerſal <hi>Self-denyal. 'Thus</hi> Leigh, <hi>in his Criticks</hi> omnino neget <hi>Prorſus Neget</hi> ſays <hi>Reynolds,</hi> Abdicet ſeipſum <hi>ſays</hi> Beza.' but the Words of Pool in his Criticks, are remarkable upon this Place, viz. <hi>'That a Man is not commanded here to deny himſelf ſimply, but reſpectively, ſo far as he is contrary to God.'</hi> Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor <hi>Bates</hi> obſerves, <q>that Self-Denial includes all that in the order of Nature belongs to us.</q> Now our ſubjective Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, conſider'd ſtrictly, is but ſelf-ſublimated, and therefore if we do not, in our aims and actings, ſubordinate it to the divine Glory, we deny CHRIST and not ourſelves.</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. The aforeſaid Doctrine deſtroy's <hi>Chriſtian Simplicity,</hi> as appears thus, the Nature of <hi>Simplicity</hi> conſiſts in directing the Mind to God in a direct Line, and in excluding all evil Deſign; and hence it is call'd a <hi>ſingle Eye</hi> by our Lord, <hi>Mat.</hi> vi. 22.23. It likewiſe inclines to <hi>conſtancy</hi> and <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:005500_0026_103967B4304719B0"/>
in the purſuit of the ſingle Scope or ſupream Mark it propoſes, (<hi>Philip.</hi> i. 20, 21. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 12.) But on the contrary, Hypocrites have a double Heart, a ſquint Eye, which looks contrary Ways. A</p>
            <p n="6">6th. <hi>Abſurdity</hi> is this <hi>that the Doctrine I have been oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, deſtroys the neceſſity of that Love, which the Goſpel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires</hi> ſo abſolutely, and inculcates ſo pungently and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For if we need not aim at God's Glory above our ſelves, or our ſubjective Happineſs conſidered ſtrictly, then we need not love him above or equal to our ſelves; the Reaſon is this, the higheſt Love neceſſarily includes the higheſt eſteem and Purſuit, and ſo (e contra) a ſmall degree of Love, little Eſteem and indifferent Purſuit. And thus the very Heart of Godlineſs is ſtruck at, by robbing it of thoſe two principal Ingredients, without which it cannot ſubſiſt, viz. Tranſcendent love to God, and of its exalted view or aim; the Glory of God, (chiefly) and by ſubſtituting in the room thereof, ſordid ſelfiſh Principles and mercenary aims: And thus Self is the Foundation and Scope of this Religion, which looks not like the ſublime and ſupernatural Religion of the Holy JESUS, but is nearer akin to that of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate Enemies the Phariſees, for what was their Religion, but a circle of lifeleſs Duties and Ceremonies, perform'd from ſelfiſh Principles and with ſelfiſh Views? Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of their Learning pretence to and fame for Religion, they were Strangers to the Power and Life of it, having no higher Principles than Nature poliſhed by Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Art. Self was the Foundation and Scope of their Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If it be objected,</hi> That theſe Men aimed chiefly at their own Honour and Intereſt in this World only.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> It is true ſome of them did ſo, but not all: <hi>Paul</hi> before his Converſion, and the <hi>young Man</hi> in the Goſpel were,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:005500_0027_103967B28A15AA40"/>
of another Stamp; they had a regard to their eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and were ſerious in ſeeking of it. And the other Phariſees, who were ſuch groſs Hypocrites as to aim at the Honours and Wealth of this World, chiefly in all their Actions, whether Civil or Religious, (it ſhould be obſerv'd, that they) aim'd at themſelves in ſo doing, and not at God or his Glory, and ſo made themſelves their higheſt Mark. It is likewiſe highly probable, that they aim'd at Wealth and Honour under the notion of Happineſs, imagining that therein or thereby they ſhould obtain Felicity: And this is no doubt the Scope of the groſſer ſort of Hypocrites of every Tribe and Order at this Day! Their cry is, <hi>who ſhall ſhew us any good?</hi> Now if we make our ſubjective Happineſs in Heaven, our chief End, the Mark is formally the ſame in both, it is Self in both, it is Happineſs in both that is aim'd at: The Difference lyes not in the End propos'd, but in a Miſtake of the Judgment concerning the Means that lead to it. The Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of ſome of the old Phariſees was more groſs, and this is more ſubtle, but it is but a chip of the ſame Block, there is as little Love to God, in the one as in the other.</p>
            <p>And indeed the aforeſaid Notion does well agree with the <hi>Mahometan</hi> impoſture, for thro' the whole <hi>Alcoran</hi> there is a deep ſilence, about ſupernatural Principles of Worſhip, ſuch as <hi>Regeneration, tranſcendent Love to God,</hi> as alſo of ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Aims, <hi>at the Glory of God above all;</hi> the chief Things that I find inculcated in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> (its foperies excepted) is ſome main Branches of natural Religion, inforced by the Conſideration of eternal Pleaſures, to be afterwards enjoy'd, as the Reward of good Works, and eternal Pains to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured as the Puniſhment of bad. The chief Difference as to the Queſtion under debate, is only this, (ſo far as I ſee) that <hi>Mahomet</hi> aim'd at <hi>ſenſual Pleaſures,</hi> and ſuch as hold the Opinion I am oppoſing, aim at <hi>ſpiritual Enjoyments</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:005500_0028_103967B1084CE0C0"/>
but both are of the ſame Mind, as to the Subſtance of the matter, viz. <hi>Dependance upon Works, and aiming at themſelves as their higheſt Mark, without a ſuperlative Regard to God's Glory.</hi> A</p>
            <p n="7">7th. <hi>Abſurdity is ſelf Worſhip,</hi> if we muſt aim at our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective Happineſs, (or our ſelves) as our laſt End, then we muſt eſteem, love, deſire after, and purſue ourſelves above all: For what we make to be the <hi>chief End,</hi> we declare to be the <hi>chief Good,</hi> and that muſt be ſo reſpected. Now, is not this inward Worſhip the moſt noble kind of Worſhip? and this we give to our ſelves, according to the Scheme I am oppoſing. We may indeed give the Cap and the Knee to our maker, but the Heart muſt be given to our ſelves. A leſſer degree of Love, for our own ſakes, we may allow our Creator, but the higheſt Degree muſt be given to ourſelves forſooth, and is not this worſe Idolatry then the <hi>Papiſts</hi> are guilty of in worſhiping images, for this Reaſon, namely, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> (for the moſt Part) allow their Images but an inferior kind of Worſhip, (which they call <hi>Duleia</hi>) but this is giving to our ſelves the ſupream (<hi>latria</hi> or) Worſhip. So that according to the aforeſaid Opinion we are to allow the great God no more Regard and Honour, than the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do the Sign of the Croſs, and their rotten rediculous Relicts; for accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereto, God is not the terminative Object, but only the medium of Worſhip.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>Another Abſurdity</hi> which naturally flows from the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Opinion is this, viz. <hi>A making that the chief End which is not the laſt.</hi> After enjoying God in Heaven, the Saints do praiſe him, and aim at his Glory, and for this End they are ſav'd, that the Glory of God's Grace may appear therein, (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> i.) That which is the chief End, muſt needs be the laſt, for this Reaſon, becauſe all other Things are referr'd to it, which they cannot be except it be the laſt: But on
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:005500_0029_103967AF6419D240"/>
the Contrary, the aforeſaid Opinion, makes that the chief which is not the laſt, and is therefore abſurd.</p>
            <p>Seeing we are not our own in reſpect of Creation, <hi>it is God that made us and not we our ſelves,</hi> &amp;c. We have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no Right to aim at our own Happineſs above the Glory of that Being, who has brought us into Exiſtence; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is moſt unjuſt to do ſo, neither are we our own in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Preſervation, Redemption, and Covenant Dedication, therefore it is moſt Ungrateful and Sacrilegious to aim at our own Happineſs above the divine Glory, it is God who holds our Souls in Life, therefore ſhould we <hi>ſing his Honours and make his Praiſe glorious,</hi> Pſalm lxvi. We are not our own for we are bought with a Price, and therefore ſhould we glorify God in our Bodies, and in our Spirits which are Gods; we alſo belong to God by covenant Contract, (<hi>Ezek.</hi> xvi. 8. <hi>Jer.</hi> xxxi. 33.) and therefore cannot without Sacrilege ſeek our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves above his Glory.</p>
            <p>Foraſmuch as the bleſſed God is poſſeſſed of the higheſt, yea infinite, incomprehenſible and inexpreſſible Eminence, it is but equal and highly reaſonable, that to him ſhould be aſcribed the higheſt Honours. Surely we ſhould <hi>render to God the Things that are Gods,</hi> Matt. xxii. 21. And therefore it is moſt unjuſt and unreaſonable to aim at our own Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or any Thing that is ours, above our Makers Glory: And ſuch as do ſo ſhould remember God's Judgment upon <hi>Herod,</hi> becauſe he would not give to God the Glory of his Gifts, but burnt Sacrifice to his own Nett, and offered In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe to his own Dregs, (<hi>Acts xji.</hi> 23.) And likewiſe the Curſe which <hi>Jehovah</hi> denounces upon the Bleſſings of thoſe Prieſts, <hi>who will not lay it to Heart, to give Glory to his Name,</hi> Mal. ii. 1, 2. It is very abſurd to imagine that the divine Majeſty ſhould imbrace Enemies into his Boſom, and yet this will follow from the Scheme I am oppoſing; for a

Man may hate God in his Heart, and yet externally ſubmit to his Government, not for God's Sake but his own. Now the oppoſite Notion ſuppoſes that the Almighty would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſuch ſelfiſh ſordid Souls, into his glorious Imbraces, than which nothing can be more falſe and unreaſonable.</p>
            <p>But to draw to the Concluſion of this Diſcourſe, I wou'd beg of my Hearers to examine themſelves, by what has been offer'd, whether they act generally from a <hi>right principle, Love to God, and to a right End, the Glory of God. As alſo whether they habitually labour to glorify God in the manner before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd?</hi> viz. <hi>by profeſſing Chriſts Truths, confeſſing of their Sins, and likewiſe by Faith, Love, Obedience, Active and Paſſive?</hi> If ſo, rejoice in God your Saviour, whatever your Affliction be! What tho' you be contemn'd, traduc'd and rejected by your profeſſed Brethren unjuſtly; but yet with pious Pretences, as if God was thereby honoured, yet be not caſt down, but conſider that ſweet Scripture, Iſ. lxvi. 5. <hi>Hear the Word of the Lord, ye that Tremble at his Word, your Brethren that hated you, that caſt you out for my Names ſake, ſaid, let the lord be glorified: But he ſhall appear to your Joy and they ſhall be aſhamed!</hi> But on the other Hand, ſuch as are ſatisfied with an outward form of Religious Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and have no Solicitude about the Principle from which, and the End to which they act, and labour not to glorify God in the Manner before expreſs'd in the Courſe of their Lives, are certainly graceleſs Hypocrites, and may therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be out aſunder at laſt by the Sword of divine Juſtice. Conſider theſe ſolemn Words of our Lord, Matt. v. 20. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept your Righteouſneſs exceeds the Righteouſneſs of the</hi> Scribes &amp; Phariſees, <hi>ye can by no means enter into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> And elſewhere <hi>if your Eye be evil, your whole Body is full of Darkneſs;</hi> your religious Performances are <hi>wild Grapes,</hi>

            <p>THE Heart is certainly the main Spring of practical Religion; when that is ſet right in its aims, then all the Wheels of Motion keep their proper Diſtances and Spheres, and anſwer a valuable End: But when this main Spring is wrong ſett, all is wrong; the Motion of the Souls Powers is irregular and vain, becauſe it tends to a wrong Mark.</p>
            <p>It is therefore of the laſt neceſſity that we be careful in chuſing of and fixing upon a right Mark in our Actions: And what can this be but GOD and <hi>his Glory?</hi> Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore give him our Hearts, and make his Honour the chief ſcope of all we do: It will be but of little Service to us to cleanſe the outſide of the Cup and Platter, if the inſide be neglected, and our aims be wrong.</p>
            <p>Do not therefore think it ſtrange my Hearers, that I dwell ſo long upon this Subject, for indeed it is the very turning Point and Foundation of all practical Godlineſs. We our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are ſurely ſuch as our governing aims be.</p>
            <p>You may remember that in the preceeding Sermon, I obſerv'd the following Point of Truth, viz. <hi>That the great Mark at which we ſhould aim chiefly, in all our Actions, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            <p>The firſt four general Heads I have diſcourſed upon, that which yet remains to be treated of, as the Subject of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Sermon, is the 5th general Head, namely to <hi>anſwer Objections.</hi>

Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> in his Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon it, after having cited Prov. xvi. 4. <hi>The Lord hath made all Things for himſelf,</hi> obſerves,
<q>That it is impoſſible it ſhould be otherwiſe, for whereas every reaſonable Agent, both propounds to himſelf ſome Reaſon of his Actions, and the beſt End he can imagine; it is impoſſible, but that God alſo in creating Man ſhould propound to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſome End, and there being no better End than his own Glory, he could propound no other to himſelf: The Glory of God being the End which he propounded to himſelf in creating Man, it muſt needs follow that that muſt be the chief and greateſt End which any Man can propound to himſelf in his Actions.</q> To confirm this

Gloſs, he in his Criticks cites <hi>Menochius, Eſtius, Grotius, Meed, and Rabi Jonah,</hi> in his Book upon Fear, who ſays,

            <p>Mr. <hi>Matthew Henery,</hi> upon the Words of our Text ſays,
<q>That in all we do, we ſhould aim at the Glory of God, at pleaſing and honouring him; this is the fundamental Principle of all practical Godlineſs; the great End of all practical Religion.—And upon Prov. xvi. 4. he ſays, That God is the firſt Cauſe, and laſt End of all, all is of him and from him, and therefore all is to him and for him. He deſigns to ſerve his own Purpoſe by all his Creatures, and he will not fail of his Deſign, the Wicked he is not glorify'd by, but will be glorifi'd upon.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Burkit</hi> upon the Words of our Text ſayeth thus,
<q>The Apoſtle directs us, to refer all our Actions in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, both natural, civil and religious to the Glory of God; to make that our ſepream Aim, our ultimate End in all we do, in all we deſign, in all we deſire. A Chriſtian is to perform his natural Actions to ſpiritual Purpoſes, and whilſt he is feeding his Body at his own Table, muſt have an Eye at his ſerving God, both with Soul and Body. But eſpecially and above all in our religious Duties, we muſt propound the Glory of God as our principal Aim, our chief Scope, our ſupream End.</q>

<q>That Godlineſs contains three Things, 1ſt. That our Obedience proceeds from love to God, as its vital Principle; this muſt warm and animate the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Action, this alone makes Obedience as delightful to us, ſo pleaſing to God. 2dly. That all our Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be regulated by his Will as the Rule. 3dly, That
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:005500_0035_103967A4EC016180"/>
the glory of God be the ſupream End of all our Actions, this Qualification muſt adhere not only to neceſſary Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but to our natural and civil Actions, <hi>Our Light muſt ſo ſhine before Men, that they may ſee our good Works &amp;c.</hi> Matt. v. 16. 1 Cor. xi. 31. A general Deſignation of this is abſolutely neceſſary. (1 <hi>Pet,</hi> iv. 11.) And the renewing our Intention in matters of Moment.

(1 Cor. vi. 19.20.)

<q>The Glory of God muſt be regarded in the firſt Place 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. <hi>whether in eating or drinking &amp;c. If in eating and drinking</hi> ſayeth he, and the uſe of our ordinary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, much more in the Supream and important Actions of our lives, ſuch as we would make a Buſineſs of, God muſt be ſpecially eyed therein; God only is independent and ſelf ſufficient of himſelf and from himſelf; but ſelf ſeeking is monſtrous and unnatural in the Creature! They are of him and by him, and for him. (<hi>Rom.</hi> xi. 36.) the Motion of the Creatures is circular, they end where they began. 2 The ſaving of our own Souls, that muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded next to the Glory of God, for next to the Love of God, Man is to love himſelf and in himſelf. 1 The bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Part; the great Errors of the World, come from miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking ſelf, and miſplacing Self, they miſplace Self, when they ſeat it above God and prefer their Intereſts before the Conſcience of their Duty to him. Then they miſtake Self, thinking ſelf is more concern'd as a Body than a Soul.

<q>look thou propoundeſt right Ends, in thy deſire of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with God.—It is lawful for thee to look to thy own Safety; God will give thee leave to look to thy ſelf, this thou mayſt do, and yet not neglect him; but never was any Peace true or ſure, where only Self-Love made it; whether it be with God, or between Man and Man, thou ſeeſt thou art undone, if thou keepeſt thy old Side, and therefore thou ſeekeſt Peace with God, <hi>as the Kings that ſerved</hi> Hadarezer, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.19. well this may be all allow'd thee to come over to God, becauſe his is the ſurer Side; never any made Peace with God, but this Argument weighed much with them; but take heed this be not all, thou aimeſt at; or the Chief thou aimeſt at, this thou mayeſt do and hate God as much as ever.

Another ſecondary and ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate, <hi>viz.</hi> The Good and Benefit of our ſelves, to invert theſe, and place our own Good in the Room of God's Glory, is ſinful and unjuſtifiable, and he that aims at himſelf only in Religion, is juſtly cenſur'd as a mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Servant.</q>

<q>That to pray to him, (meaning God) that he would do this or that, finally and ultimately for any thing elſe, than his own Name, is humbly to ſupplicate him, that he would reſign the Godhead, and quit his Throne to this or that Creature. 2. —That primitive Nature, was no doubt pointed upon God, as the laſt End. Otherwiſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had been made with an Averſion to him, and in the higheſt pitch of Enmity and Rebellion; ſince there can be no higher Controverſy than about the laſt End. <hi>And adds,</hi> that the Deſign of renewing Grace, is to reſtore us to our original State, and fix us in that abſolute Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to God which was original and natural to us; <hi>then he obſerves,</hi> the Controverſy is taken up, which was about no lower Thing than the Deity; who ſhould be

            <p>Mr. <hi>Willard</hi> in his Body of Divinty, <hi>pag.</hi> 6. 7. ſayeth,
<q>That Man can have no other laſt End, but God and his Glory, for then it muſt be either the Creature or himſelf, a third cannot be thought of; but it can be neither of theſe, as will appear. — 1. Becauſe the Creature is infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to him, a Man's End is to be look'd for, above him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and not beneath him; but Man is ſuperior to theſe. 2. Becauſe that Man is the Creatures next End, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be his laſt End, that that ſhould be made for Man's Service, and yet that Man ſhould be to ſerve that, implyeth a Contradiction. 3. Becauſe the Creatures cannot ſatisfy him, Man's laſt End and objective Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the ſame, (<hi>Ecleſ.</hi> i. 8.) 2. Neither can he be his own laſt End: For, 1. The End muſt be ſomething better than the Means, that ſerve to it. 2. There is a better being, than Man, and therefore he cannot be his own chief End: The laſt End, and chief Good, are one and the ſame; there is therefore no reſting, until we come there. 3. A Man cannot be his own Happineſs, and therefore not his own chief End. An End that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not happify him, is not worthy of that Name! Again he aſſerts, that Man's next chief End, to the glorifying of God is to enjoy him forever!</q>

            <p>Mr. <hi>Vincent</hi> alſo in his Expoſition of the Aſſembly's Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm, approv'd of by 40 Divines, is alſo of the ſame Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent with the reſt I have mentioned; as appears from the Reaſons he gives, why Men ſhould chiefly deſign the glorifying of God in all their Actions; which are theſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:005500_0041_1039679AE96B5520"/>
               <q>becauſe God has made them, preſerves them, has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd them, and given his Word and Spirit to direct and aſſiſt, and promiſed his Kingdom to encourage them, to glorify him.</q> See <hi>pag,</hi> 4. From the aforeſaid Words it appears that Mr. <hi>Vincent</hi> look'd upon the Glory of God to be the End, and Happineſs but as a Motive exciting to ſeek after it. I now proceed to the</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>General Head,</hi> which was to anſwer Objections. <hi>Objec.</hi> 1. "<hi>That which God promiſes on his Part in his covenant Dealings, with Man is Man's chief Good, or which is the ſame, Man's chief End; but the Thing God promiſes is Salvation,</hi> ergo. <hi>Had God promis'd any Thing leſs, it would not be call'd the exceeding Riches of his Grace, and that Salvation is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed by God in his Covenant Dealings with</hi> Man; <hi>is evident from</hi> Mark xvi. 16. He that believeth, ſhall be ſaved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> If that which God only or chiefly promiſed, in the New-Covenant was Salvation, conſider'd ſtrictly and ſubjectively, or ſeparated from his Glory, then the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence would avail, otherwiſe not, but God has no where promiſed, a Salvation ſeparated from his Glory, as appears from what has been before obſerved, to which I will add one Place of Scripture, <hi>Pſ.</hi> l. 15. <hi>Call upon me in the Day of Trouble; I will deliver thee, and thou ſhalt glorify me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Object. 2. <hi>It is our firſt and moſt deeply Fundamental Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to take the Lord for our God; which moſt eſſentially in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes our taking him, (the Enjoyment of him, and not our glorifying him, or his Glory) for our ſupream Good; which is acknowledg'd by all to be our chief End.</hi>

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Notion of enjoying God, ſeparate from glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying him, or his Glory; is an antiſcriptural ridiculous Whim! If it be a fundamental Duty, to take the Lord for our God, then it muſt be a fundamental Error (in practical Religion) to take our ſelves for our God; by prefering what
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:005500_0042_10396799676A1A68"/>
reſpects us, to his Honour, <hi>viz.</hi> our enjoying him, to his Glory: For here God is not regarded for himſelf, but only as he reſpects us, it is true the Word GOD is mentioned, in enjoying him, but that is only a Flam, a Blind: For its ſtill in Subordination to the ſordid <hi>god-Self!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Does not that Faith which is included, in taking the Lord for our God, draw us out of ourſelves to CHRIST, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite us to his Perſon, before it gives us Communion in his Benefits? (<hi>Gal.</hi> ii. 20. <hi>Phil.</hi> iii. 8, 9.) And does it not excite us to admire the Former more than the Latter? (<hi>Cant.</hi> v. 10.) Surely to thoſe that <hi>believe, CHRIST is precious!</hi> And is it not the Sign of an Harlot, to do the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> to regard in Marriage, the Portion more than the Perſon?</p>
            <p>Object. 3. <hi>Is praiſing God for Bleſſings, a greater Good than the Bleſſings for which they praiſe him? If ſo, the Saints have a hard Bargain, in giving a greater Good for a leſs, if not, than the Enjoyment of God is a greater Good, than praiſing of him, and ſo is our chief Good and laſt End!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I will be bold to aſſert, that the Saints praiſing God, is (terminatively) more noble, than the Benefits they offer Praiſes for, conſidered ſtrictly; becauſe of its near Relation to the beſt of Beings; neither is the Conſequence reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that thus the Saints would have a hard Bargain, in giving a greater Good for a leſs. The Force of this Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, is built upon a ſuppos'd Analogy, between civil Bargains among Men and the Saints praiſing God for Benefits they receive from him, in the following Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. 1. In civil Bargains, the Commodity a Perſon gives in exchange, for Good he deſerves, he no ways owes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the Perſon he deals with. 2. The Good he gives is in his own Power, it is his proper Right by Inheritance or Purchaſe, which he can diſpoſe of as he ſees beſt, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his worldly Intereſt. 3. The Good exchang'd, is
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:005500_0043_10396797C4916730"/>
profitable to the Receiver. 4. In this kind of <hi>Truck,</hi> when there is not ſome Proportion in the Value of the Things exchang'd, it's ſaid to be a hard Bargain. If the Caſe was ſo in God's Dealings with his People, there would be ſome Reaſon for the aforeſaid Conſequence, otherwiſe none at all! Are not Mens Praiſes a Debt they owe to God upon many Accounts, a Debt which they cannot pay, 'til Power be given them of God, and that brought into exerciſe by his gracious Operations, a Power which they have no heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Right to, nor are they able to purchaſe it by their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; a Debt which when paid, profits not the Receiver, for our Goodneſs extends not to God. Tho' Praiſe be the Creatures Act, yet it is God who works all our Works in us! And thus the Sophiſm evaniſhes.</p>
            <p>Obj. 4. <hi>The End and Scope of our Faith, is our chief End, for Faith is the greateſt Duty, we owe to God, and the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all the Reſt, yea it is the Gift of God, and the greateſt Gift we can receive in this World; it hence follows, that the End of the greateſt Gift, and the greateſt Duty, is Man's chief End; but the End of Faith is Salvation</hi> 1 Pet. i. 19. <hi>Erg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> That which is the final or ſupream Scope of Faith is our chief End, no doubt, but what is only its interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate or ſubordinate Scope, is not; neither does the Place of Scripture aduc'd prove any more!</p>
            <p>Obj. 5. <hi>Man's greateſt Motive to Duty, is his chief End, but his greateſt Motive to Duty is his Salvation;</hi> Erg. <hi>the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a rational Creature, muſt have a Motive or incitement, for whoever acts without a Motive, acts without Reaſon. It is the diſtinguiſhing Character of a rational Creature, to propoſe to himſelf an End, and then to purſue that End in proper Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods; hence Logicians tell us, the End is firſt in the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and laſt in the Execution; which makes it evident, that
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:005500_0044_103967962108A270"/>
the Motive and the End are ſynonimous, conſequently the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt or chief Motive, is the chief End. Now that Man's great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Motive to Duty is his Salvation, appears from the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Places of Scripture; are we commanded to be faithful to Death, what is the Motive?</hi> Why thou ſhalt receive a Crown of Life, <hi>Rev.</hi> ii. 10. <hi>are we commanded to walk uprightly, and what is the Motive? Why</hi> the Lord will give Grace and Glory; <hi>and laſtly are we commanded to</hi> Love the Lord our God, with all our Heart and Soul, <hi>&amp;c. And what is the Motive? Why this</hi> do, and thou ſhalt live, <hi>Luke</hi> x. 28.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Places of Scripture brought to confirm the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid <hi>Objection,</hi> do only prove, that the Expectation of obtaining Happineſs in the Way of Duty, is a great Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to the Performance of it; and that it is ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd by God himſelf in his Word, but what is this to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe? The Thing to be prov'd is, that Salvation ſtrictly and ſubjectively conſidered, is the greateſt Motive to Duty: of this there is not a Word in the preceeding Proofs. The contrary thereto appears in the following Scriptures. (<hi>Mat.</hi> v. 16. <hi>John</hi> xv. 8.) And l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t me farther add, that the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid logical Maxim, ſerves to prove the Glory of God, to be the chief End, thus, if that which is laſt in Execution, is or ought to be the firſt in Intention, then by conſequence God's Glory ought to be firſt intended by us, becauſe it is laſt in Execution, (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> i. 6.)</p>
            <p>Obj. 6. <hi>That which the Saints, of both the Old and New-Teſtament made their great Motive to do and ſuffer for God, we ought to make our great Motive,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And that this is as aforeſaid, our chief End, but the Saints,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>made their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation their great Motive,</hi> &amp;c. Erg. <hi>Its hard if we cannot find one Saint in the Old or New-Teſtament that will direct us, what we ought to make our chief End, and they all made their Salvation their chief Motive: For this</hi> Moſes <hi>refuſed

to be called the Son of</hi> Pharaoh<hi>'s Daughter, and choſe to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Afflictions with the People of God, it is applicable to all theſe Heroes, mentioned in the</hi> xi. <hi>of the</hi> Hebrews, <hi>as appears by the firſt Verſe of the Chapter. Now Faith is the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Things hoped for; what was it that animated</hi> Paul, <hi>to preſs towards the Mark, through all the Difficulties he met with?</hi> why the Prize of the high calling in CHRIST JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS, <hi>Phil.</hi> iii. 14. <hi>What was the Motive, that enabled the</hi> Hebrews <hi>to take joyfully the ſpoiling of their Goods? why be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they knew they had</hi> in Heaven a better and an enduring Subſtance, <hi>Heb.</hi> x. 3, 4. <hi>What enabled the Apoſtles to bear with Patience, the Afflictions they ſufferd but this? that they</hi> work'd out for them, a far more exceeding, and eternal weight of Glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Scriptures adduc'd in the Objection, do not prove the labouring Point, namely, that Salvation conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſtrictly, was the higheſt Motive of thoſe good Men mentioned, and therefore the Argument does not conclude. The <hi>Objectors</hi> Opinion concerning all God's People, is much what, with Satans concerning <hi>Job,</hi> as I humbly conceive; which appears thus, after God himſelf had given an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Character of <hi>Job,</hi> namely, that he was a ſincere Man, <hi>one that feared God and eſchewed Evil,</hi> which imply an unfeigned Love to God's Majeſty, and tranſcendent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to his Glory. But <hi>Satan</hi> in Oppoſition to the juſt Encomium, that God himſelf had given of <hi>Job,</hi> ſuggeſts, that <hi>Job</hi> was not ſuch an upright Man, that his religious Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice did not ſpring principally from Love to God, or Regard to his Glory; but was directed to, by, and ſelfiſh Ends; and therefore that he was but a Mercenary and a Hypocrite. <hi>Does he fear God for Nought,</hi> ſaid Satan, <hi>touch all that he hath, &amp; he will curſe thee to thy Face.</hi> The Devil here inſinuates, that <hi>Job</hi> had no noble internal Principles of Love and Holineſs, no
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:005500_0046_10396792D1C560A0"/>
ſupream and endear'd Regard to the Divine Honour, but that he was mov'd chiefly or only, by outward ſelfiſh Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects; and that if theſe were taken away, he would quit his Religion entirely, and curſe his Maker; this is in Subſtance the ſame with the Repreſentation given by our <hi>Objector,</hi> of all the Saints of the Old and New Teſtament, in the Objection which I am now conſidering; all the Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces between the Objector's and Satan's Opinion, are theſe, The Objector he holds, that the Saints eyed chiefly in all their Actions, the Happineſs of the higher Part of ſelf, the Soul; but Satan the Happineſs of the lower Part of ſelf, the Body, the Objectors Opinion, concerns the whole Army of the Saints in all Ages, which is very uncharitable, but Satan's only a particular Perſon, namely, <hi>Job.</hi> I know not that we have any Account in Scripture, that Satan has been ſo bold as to impeach all the Saints at once, with the aforeſaid Charge! Again the Objector offers his Opinion as a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of the Saints, which is not ſo ſenſible as could have been wiſh'd; but Satan as an Accuſation againſt <hi>Job!</hi> Once more the Objector offers his Opinion, with a deal of Confidence, and Airs of Aſſurance; but Satan begins mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly, and holds it till juſt the Cloſe of his Speech; but the Objectors and Satans Opinion are the very ſame in this ſubſtantial Point, namely, in excluding that tranſcendent Love to God for himſelf, and ſupream Regard to his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which are eſſential to true Godlineſs, and conſtituting ſelfiſh Conſiderations in the Room thereof. It is true the Objector has the Advantage of Satan in this particular, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in believing that the Saints had a chief Regard, to the Intereſts of the higher Part of ſelf the Soul, whereas Satan was of Opinion, that <hi>Job</hi> eyed chiefly the Intereſt of the lower Part of <hi>Self</hi> the Body. But again it muſt be own'd, that Satan had the Advantage of the Objector, in other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:005500_0047_1039679108E023F8"/>
               <hi>viz.</hi> 1 In that he offer'd his Opinion as an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation and ſo the God of infinite Wiſdom took it. 2. In that he did not accuſe the whole Body of the Saints, by the Lump, but a particular Perſon. 3. That he manag'd his Argument with Modeſty, for the moſt Part, for he propos'd and inſiſted on his Allegation, (moſtly) by way of Query <hi>does</hi> Job, <hi>ſaid he, fear God for nought?</hi> Thus it is evident that the Objector and Satan harmonize in Judgment ſubſtantially, and differ only in the Caſe aforeſaid, in ſome Circumſtances; which if compar'd and weigh'd it would be hard to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, which had the better of it. But leaving the Deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this to Perſons of greater Capacities, I proceed to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the Devils Accuſation being offer'd, and the great God himſelf having another Opinion of <hi>Job</hi>'s Integrity, puts the Matter to Iſſue, and lets Satan try him with all his Darts; (only to ſpare his Life) the Devil being full of Rage, and Deſire to make his Accuſation good, leſt he ſhould be poſted for a Lyar or falſe Accuſer, as indeed he well deſerv'd; environ'd him with all his Terrors, and ſhot the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venom'd Darts at him that he had in all his Helliſh Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, he ſoon diſrob'd him of all his Ornaments, and cruelly bereav'd him of his maſſy Wealth, dear Relations, Health and Eaſe, in a ſudden and tremenduous Manner! And left him nothing but a ſcolding Wife, who was almoſt as great a Tormentor as himſelf, and fain would allure him to make the Enemy's Impeachment good, <hi>by curſing his God,</hi> whoſe Language Sr. <hi>Richard Blackmore</hi> ſets in juſt and flaming Colours, in the following Lines.</p>

            <p>But even when poor <hi>Job,</hi> was under a horrible Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of all manner of Miſery, that the ſubtilty and Malice of his formidable Enemy, could invent and inflict upon his Mind and Body; while in the mean Time, the God he loved withdrew his beamy Smiles, and on the contrary ſhot Arrows dipt in burning Vengeance, into his perplexed Soul, and compaſs'd him with the moſt affrighting Terrors! I ſay while Heaven it ſelf frown'd, and Earth and Hell conſpir'd to diſtreſs and ſhake that gallant noble Soul, yet he remain'd, like a Rock impregnable amidſt all the boiſterous Billows, with which he was environ'd round: For notwithſtanding ſome humane Weakneſſes, that drop't from his troubled Soul, in the Height of his Anguiſh; yet he would never ſpeak diſhonourably of his God, or reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully of his Religion! He kept firm to the divine Majeſty, in the midſt of the terrible Tempeſt! And thus the Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Satan (reſpecting the Opinion aforeſaid) are ſolidly confuted by the Book of <hi>Job.</hi> The Caſe now in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, has been fairly try'd and God himſelf the Judge of Heaven and Earth, has brought in the Verdict in <hi>Job</hi>'s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, <hi>Job.</hi> i. 21. <hi>in all this</hi> Job <hi>ſinned not, nor charged God fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly,</hi> and Chapt. xlii. 7. <hi>Ye have not ſpoken of me the Thing that is Right as my Servant</hi> Job <hi>hath!</hi>

Ought that to fire their Affections, raiſe their Deſires, and actuate their Wills?</hi> Secret Things belong to God, <hi>Things reveal'd to us! If there be a Covenant between God and Man, the Principal aim of both cannot be the ſame! In all Covenants there are two contracting Parties at leaſt, a Mediator is not a Mediator of one, there is alſo the Thing covenanted for, and the Conſideration, or what each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty expects of the other, what God expects from us, is that we glorify him, and what he promiſes, is that he will be our God, or ſupream Good, which certainly can be nothing leſs than the Enjoyment of him!</hi>

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Different ſorts of Creatures, ſerve indeed differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſubordinate or lower Ends, but what then; can't they in the mean Time ſerve one and the ſame higheſt End? Do not the brute Creation, while they ſerve the Good of Mankind, at the ſame Time <hi>objectively</hi> declare the Glory of God's Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Power and Goodneſs in their Formation, Order and Uſefulneſs? The End which the Almighty had in View in the Formation of all, viz. His Glory, is anſwered by all, tho' in a different Manner: Rational Creatures do or ought to glorify God <hi>actively;</hi> and for this they had a Capacity gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them and a command laid upon them, and if they do it not <hi>actively,</hi> as it is their Duty, they ſhall <hi>paſſively;</hi> as the Pſalmiſt juſtly obſerves, <hi>The very Heavens declare the Glory of God, and the Earth ſheweth his Handy Works;</hi> the inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Creation offer Occaſion to thinking Beings to praiſe God: Now tho' the Glory of God be differently expreſs'd according to their ſeveral Ranks of Exiſtence, yet it is the ſame prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Deſign that God hath in all, namely his declarative Glory; and it is the ſame thing that is manifeſted by all, tho' in a different Manner, viz. The Honour of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Attributes, and indeed herein the unſearchable Riches,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:005500_0050_1039678C56A8CBE8"/>

            <p>Now if Gods declarative Glory be his higheſt End, in the Creation of all, as both Scripture and Reaſon demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, then it muſt be the Creatures laſt End too, otherwiſe theſe Abſurdities will inevitably follow, viz. 1ſt. That God will miſs his End, which would deſtroy the divine Felicity, and ſo is Blaſphemous! And 2d. It wou'd be the Creatures Duty to contradict their Creator, which is monſtrous Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy likewiſe! Conformity to our Creator is equally our Honour and Duty! It is moſt evident, that God requires a great Part of our Submiſſion to his Sovereignity, and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his Law in this very Thing, that we harmoniouſly concur with himſelf, in carrying on the ſame great deſign with him, of his GLORY, in that Way which beſt ſuits the order of our Being: And indeed when we do otherwiſe, we walk contrary to God, and may expect therefore, that, ſo continuing, he will walk contrary to us. Had Man ſtill continued in his original Integrity, he had ſtill made it his higheſt deſign to Glorify and Honour the Author of his Being! It is true we are now to conſider Man in his fallen State, wherein he is expoſed to deſerved Puniſhment for his Tranſgreſſion, and therefore has juſt Reaſon to be anxiouſly concern'd about his eſcaping the Wrath to come; but the Tranſgreſſion of the Creature, does not cannot diſolve his Creators claim of right to his Love and Homage. And when a Sinner is truly ſanctified, he is again reſtor'd to much of that primitive rectitude which was loſt by Sin, (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> iv. 24) and conſequently makes that again his higheſt aim and deſign, to which he was engag'd and inclin'd by the Law of his Creation.</p>

               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> The Inſtance as to <hi>Moſes,</hi> mention'd <hi>Ex.</hi> 32.12. is plainly this, That ſuch was his Regard to the Glory of God, that he would chooſe Death rather than the Heathen Nations ſhould inſult the Almighty, and behave themſelves proudly againſt him, upon the Occaſion of his deſtroying the People in the Wilderneſs; which he foreſaw they would be apt to do, and therefore plead that <hi>Iſrael</hi> might be ſpared, (See <hi>Num.</hi> xiv. 13 to the 17) much after the ſame manner God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf expreſſes his own Regard to his Glory. (<hi>Deut.</hi> xxxii. 26, 27.) As to the Inſtance of <hi>Paul,</hi> I ſhall crave leave to cite the Words of Mr. <hi>Matthew Henery</hi> upon it; which are theſe,
<q>
                  <hi>I could wiſh,</hi> he doth not ſay <hi>I do wiſh,</hi> for it was
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:005500_0053_1039678749B9AB78"/>
no proper means appointed for ſuch an End; but if it were, I could wiſh <hi>that I my ſelf were accurſed from Chriſt, for my Brethren;</hi> a very high pang of Zeal and Affection for his Countrymen, he would be willing to undergo the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt miſery to do them good: Love uſes to be thus bold and venterous, and ſelf denying, becauſe the Glory of God's Grace in the Salvation of many, is to be prefer'd before the Wellfare and Happineſs of a ſingle Perſon. <hi>Paul,</hi> if they were put in Competition, would be content to forego all his own Happineſs to purchaſe theirs.</q> thus far he. Whither we underſtand by the Word <hi>accurſed,</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, or temporal Death, with <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> and <hi>Pool,</hi> or the loſs of eternal Happineſs, with <hi>Eſtius, Toletus, Ludovicus dediu, Calvin, Menochius;</hi> yet it ſhews a great Love; what a fleſhly Love? No, the Chapter will inform us, that it was Love to their Souls, and a deſire after their Happineſs, and conſequently he had an Eye to God's Glory, which is thereby manifeſted! The Reaſon offer'd to confirm the Objection, viz. <hi>That by ſuffering thoſe Things God could not be Glorify'd,</hi> &amp;c. is anſwered by conſidering, that the deſires of thoſe holy Men were not abſolute and peremtory, but Hypothetical or Conditional, <hi>viz,</hi> that rather than God's Glory ſhould be eclips'd, they were willing to endure thoſe Things, if they were appointed Means to obtain ſuch an End. To ſuppoſe that their Love was wholly Carnal, is to confront the Context of the Places whence the aforeſaid In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are borrow'd, and paſs an uncharitable Cenſure upon thoſe Worthy's, as tho' they were Perſons of the moſt ſordid Diſpoſition and Character!</p>
            <p>Objection 9. Aſaph <hi>acted chiefly from ſelfiſh Principles, in Religion, as appears from Pſal</hi> lxxiii. 12.13.14. Behold theſe are the ungoldly who proſper in the World. Verily I have cleanſed my Heart in vain, and waſhed my Hands in
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:005500_0054_1039678581767360"/>
Innocency, for all the Day long have I been plaug'd and chaſtned every morning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer, Aſaph</hi> only tells us of a paſt Temptation, what a poſing Difficulty it had been to him, to conſider how that the Godly had generally the hardeſt Lot, as to worldly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts: This (<hi>arcanum</hi> or) ſecret of divine Providence, had ſo exercis'd him, that he, thro' the Corruptions of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Temptations of the Devil, was like to have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd hard and unbecoming Tho'ts of Religion; nay it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that he had been guilty of this in ſome degree, <hi>for his Feet were almoſt gone!</hi> But in his more compoſed frame, he reflected upon the corrupt influences of thoſe Temptations with abhorrence! He calls himſelf a <hi>Fool</hi> and a <hi>Beaſt</hi> on that Account (as well he might) ver. 22. <hi>So fooliſh was I and ignorant, I was as a Beaſt before thee.</hi> In a time of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent Temptation, he was drove to be pretty much of the ſelfiſh Opinion I am oppoſing, <hi>viz.</hi> to think it was a poor Thing only to ſerve and glorify God, except it was attended with other Advantages; but afterwards when he grew more calm, and got out of the violence of Temptation, he calls himſelf a <hi>Fool,</hi> an <hi>Ignoramus,</hi> and a <hi>Beaſt</hi> (or as the Word is interpreted a <hi>great Beaſt</hi>) for it; and acknowledges, that ſuch Speeches, would <hi>be an Offence againſt the Generation of God's Children.</hi> See ver. 15.</p>
            <p>Object. 10. <hi>It was</hi> Paul's <hi>Sentiment, that the chief if not the only Motive to Obedience, was the hope of eternal Life,</hi> for if the Dead ariſe not to receive their Reward, let us eat and drink, walk in the Way of our own Heart, and in the Sight of our own Eyes, and give a looſe to all our Deſires! If in this Life only we have hope, we are of all Men moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; what advantageth it me, that I have fought with Beaſts at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> if the Dead ariſe not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="unknown:005500_0055_10396783D5744B58"/>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> The aforeſaid Paſſage of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul's</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv.) are foreign to the labouring Argument; for what he ſays in them, is upon the Suppoſition of no fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture State at all after this Life; and upon the Suppoſition of the conſequent Falſehood of the Doctrines of the Goſpel, (ver. 14.15. &amp; ſeq.) Upon this Hypotheſis he obſerves, that the Chriſtians of that age were indeed the moſt miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of Mankind, to expoſe themſelves to ſuch heavy Perſecution for nothing, for an impoſture. Whereas in this Argument, we conſider a future State as moſt certain and the Doctrines of the Goſpel as moſt true and worthy of all Acceptation; and that there is an inſeparable connection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween believing Obedience in this Life, and compleat Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in the Life to come: And ſo the Queſtion is, which ought to be the chief and laſt End of our Obedience, the Glory of God, or the obtaining our own Happineſs meerly conſider'd as ſuch, without any reſpect to the Glory of God, or eternal glorifying of him in Heaven?</p>
            <p>Now if the aforeſaid Expreſſions of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> be ſuppoſed to favour the latter of theſe Opinions, they muſt be taken in the following Senſe, viz. That were his Obedience to God nothing concern'd, with his future Happineſs; but that he could be ſav'd without Holineſs, as well as with it, that then he would be at no pains, or care to ſerve God at all; but on the contrary give a looſe to all his vitious Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</p>
            <p>But by this Senſe of the Words, the Objector makes (in his Opinion) the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> to be a Hypocrite, and an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure; for hereby it's neceſſarily ſuppos'd, that he had no Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Principles of Action, ſuch as divine Life, Love, Holineſs; but that on the contrary he had a ſuperior Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to live after the Fleſh, but was reſtrain'd from acting
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:005500_0056_1039678202BF04A8"/>
according thereto, meerly by the external Conſideration of Advantages, to be had by it in the next State!</p>
            <p>Beſides the bleſſed Apoſtle is condemned, as an <hi>Epicure</hi> by the Objector; what has been already ſaid gives Weight to this, to which I may add, that of aſcribing the <hi>Epicures</hi> proverb to him as his fix'd Judgment, only that he was divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from acting accordingly by ſelfiſh Conſiderations. The Proverb that was very Familiar among the <hi>Epicurians,</hi> was this.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Lude, bibas, comedas, poſt mortem nulla voluptas. i. e.</hi> play, eat, drink, for after Death there is no Pleaſure,</q> and that of Martial.</p>
            <q>
               <l>
                  <hi>"Vita nimis ſera eſt, craſtina vive Hodie.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Life to-morrow is too late, live to day.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Now the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> uſed the aforeſaid <hi>Epicurian</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, namely, <hi>let us eat and drink,</hi> &amp;c. with a deſign to confute it, as appears from the 33 and 34 verſes of the Chapter. Poſſibly the Force of his Reaſonings may be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried thus far, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſuppoſing the <hi>Dead riſe not,</hi> the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picurian</hi> Notion would be then more tolerable: But to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that he ſpoke abſolutely here, is, in other Words, to ſay. that he believed there was no intrinſick Excellency in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, or Comforts attending the ſincere Pract<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap>e Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages enſuing upon it, in a future State. And not this the Sentiment of a ſelfiſh ſordid Soul? But the Apoſtle ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be a Perſon of a very different Character by his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. <hi>See Rom.</hi> 6.2. <hi>How ſhall we (i. e.</hi> how can we) <hi>who are dead to Sin, live any longer therein?</hi> Thoſe that are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated have an inward fix'd Principle, termed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>the Seed of God,</hi> which creates a habitual Averſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Sin, and propenſity to Holineſs!</p>
            <p>Obj, 11. Self Love is the Foundation of all the Love, we owe or pay to God, <hi>what God is in himſelf we know not: The
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:005500_0057_103967807B4DFDD8"/>
only thing to determine our deſire, love, and fear of God, is his Attributes, as manifeſted to us in Creation, Protection and Redemption; its nothing to the Purpoſe to tell how lovely and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent God is in himſelf, abſolutely conſidered; for tho' we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider him as cloth'd with all poſſible Perfections, without hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to do with us, it will only raiſe our Admiration; if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider him as able and willing to make us happy, this will raiſe Deſire; if we conſider him as juſt and powerful, and are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Apprehenſions that he will puniſh us, this raiſes Fear; if realy puniſhed by him, without hopes of releaſe, this rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Averſion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>if we conſider him as good and merciful, and we are realy poſſeſs'd of it, this raiſes Love,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> iv. 19. We love him becauſe he firſt loved us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> The falſehood of the Poſition, contain'd in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Objection, will appear by the following Conſiderations, viz. 1ſt, Then we owe no love to God becauſe of his eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Excellency, which is abſurd; for what is infinitely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable is a proper Object of Love, and becauſe it deſerves it, it therefore demands in Reaſon and Juſtice our ſupream Affection. 2dly, The aforeſaid Poſition, deſtroys entirely the neceſſity of ſupernatural Principles of Action, infus'd by Regeneration; for if we muſt love only for Benefits receiv'd, and not for the ſake of the Giver conſidered abſtractly, than there is no need of any thing but Nature, to excite to this. The <hi>Pagans</hi> who had nothing but natures Light to direct them, taught and practiſed this. <hi>Lycurgus</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Law-giver, would make no law againſt Ingratitude, becauſe as he obſerv'd, <hi>It was a prodigious Impiety, not to repay a Benefit:</hi> And <hi>Seneca,</hi> in his Book <hi>de Beneficiis,</hi> ſays, <hi>Not to return one good Office for another, is inhuman; but to return evil for Good, is diabolical,</hi> p. 104. and in p. 54. 5. 6. he ſays, <hi>all benefits muſt be gratuitious, a Merchant,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſells me Corn, that keeps me and my Family from ſtarving, but he
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:005500_0058_1039677E91C028B0"/>
ſold it for his Intereſt, as well as I bought it for mine, and ſo I owe him nothing for it.—This, ſays he, is more properly the driving of a Trade, then the cultivating of a generous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce;</hi> thus far he. Now tho' I believe that we may eye our own Happineſs, in our religious Service, yet when we do this above the divine Glory, it comes under <hi>Seneca's</hi> laſh, and is ſolidly confuted by him in the preceeding Lines.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. The aforeſaid Poſition, juſtifies the Devils, and damned's hating God, for they are puniſhed by God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Hopes of releaſe, and therefore may have an Averſion to him, according to the preceeding Objection. And farther if we are to love him only becauſe of the Love he expreſſes to us, then when he puniſhes us, tho' moſt juſtly for our Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and therewith deprives us of all hopes of Mercy, we may hate him Law-fully, (for there is no Medium between love and hatred) that is, we may hate infinite Holineſs, Juſtice and Excellency, which is abſurd!</p>
            <p n="4">4. If we are bound to love God only, becauſe of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits we receive or hope for from him, then we are not bound to love him at all; for the Reſpect we offer to him is not for himſelf, but for the Benefits we receive, and thus true Love to God, which is the Fulfilment of the Law, and Scope of the Goſpel, is deſtroy'd entirely by this Notion. For accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, our Love ought to be wholly center'd upon the Benefits we receive for our own ſake, and ſo upon ourſelves: Even <hi>Seneca,</hi> the <hi>Pagan</hi> Stoick, could ſay, this for that, is rather a truck than a Benefit.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The aforeſaid Poſition deſtroy's the Creators Right to the Creatures Love and Obedience, when he does not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them to be profitable to himſelf and therefore if a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in deſpair, ſhould hate God, even in this Life, he is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the aforeſaid Poſition in ſo doing. But,</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="56" facs="unknown:005500_0059_1039677D0E4EF6C0"/>6. The aforeſaid Objection is inconſiſtent with itſelf, for while it allows, that a view of the divine Perfections, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Relation to our Benefit, may cauſe Admiration, this Oppoſes the other Part of it, for what is Admiration, but a high degree of Eſteem, and is not this the Foundation of all rational Love?</p>
            <p n="7">7. The aforeſaid Poſition contradicts the Experience of true Believers, who even in the dark Hours of Deſſertion, when they think they are forſaken of and hated by God, yet thro' that inward Principle of divine Life which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd into them by Converſion; feel workings of Deſire in them after God, and Love to him: <hi>Jonah</hi> was an Inſtance of this, Jon. 2.4. <hi>Then I ſaid, I am caſt off out of thy Sight, yet will I look again towards thy holy Temple.</hi> When <hi>Aſaph</hi> fear'd that God had forgotten him, and that his Mercy was clean gone from him, yet he wou'd acknowledge his infirmity, remember God, meditate upon his Works, and talk of his wondrous Doings; and <hi>Job</hi> in his Diſtreſs profeſs'd, <hi>that tho' God ſhould ſlay him, yet he would truſt in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. The aforeſaid Poſition deſtroys the Reaſonableneſs of loveing our Enemies <hi>of bleſſing them that curſe us</hi> and doing good to thoſe <hi>that deſpitefully uſe us!</hi> For if Self-Love, be the Foundation of all the Love we owe or pay to God, then it follows unavoidably that it is more ſo of all the Love we owe or pay to Man, than the hating thoſe that hate us, and curſing thoſe that curſe us, &amp;c. is in itſelf Reaſonable; for there is no ſelfiſh Motive if we conſider thoſe Things ſimply to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite us to do otherwiſe. But does not this Notion expreſly contradict the Goſpel of CHRIST as well as the true Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts of Society, and juſtify the dreadful <hi>Pagan</hi> Principle <hi>of hating our Enemies!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as for the Text cited in the Objection, it will not bear the weight that is laid upon it, for it ſays not, that the
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:005500_0060_1039677B673D7C88"/>
Saints of old, lov'd God either <hi>only</hi> or <hi>chiefly,</hi> for his love to them, and yet this is the thing in Queſtion; the <hi>Tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the aforeſaid Objection is to ſap the Foundations of the whole Goſpel, and to put natural Religion or Deiſm in the Room of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obj. 12. <hi>The Difference between Hypocriſy and Sincerity may be known according to the Scheme of making Man's ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective Happineſs his laſt End thus.</hi> 1. <hi>From their Works; Hypocrites do all to be ſeen of Men, and conſequently have nothing, but outward Performances, but the ſincere Chriſtian, Glorifies God in Thought as well as in Word and Action.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This Propoſition is indefinite and ſo equivalent to a univerſal, it is as much as to ſay, every Hypocrite does as aforeſaid. And this is not true in fact; we have no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe that <hi>Paul</hi> before Converſion did all to be ſeen of Men! Beſides if the Propoſition were true, it would then follow by the Law of contraries, that every one that had, or hath good Thoughts and Reſolutions, which are Acts of the Mind and Will, or any Deſires after his own Salvation, muſt be a ſincere Chriſtian: By this rule, <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meleck</hi> the <hi>Pagan, Balam</hi> the Wizard, <hi>Saul</hi> the Tyrant, <hi>Simon</hi> the Sorceror, and <hi>Judas</hi> the Traytor are dub'd for good Men! But a 2. Sign of Sincerity that is offer'd is this,
<q>The Hypocrite doth it to obtain a corruptible Crown, but the Sincere an incorruptible.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Both the aforeſaid Signs are the ſame, for both reſpect the End of Action, &amp; both reſpect a temporal Reward; tho' there be ſome Difference in Specie, yet the Genus or Kind is the ſame: What view to Honour or worldly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, had the fooliſh Virgins or thoſe graceleſs Jews, whom the Apoſtle Paul ſpeaks of (<hi>Rom.</hi> x.) <hi>who had a Zeal, but not according to Knolwedge?</hi> But pray obſerve and ſee if the Objector, does not prove himſelf to be a Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:005500_0061_10396779B32ABD58"/>
by his own Signs! <hi>Thus;</hi> If he be a Hypocrite, who makes the Intereſt of the lower part of <hi>Self, the Body,</hi> in this World his chief End; will it not follow, that he is alſo a Hypocrite, who makes the Intereſts of the higher Part of ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> the Soul, (without regard to God's Glory) in the next World his chief End? Are they not both built on the ſame <hi>Foundation of immoderate Self-Love?</hi> all the Difference between them is this, that the firſt reſpects the lower Part of Self, and ſo is more groſs; and the Latter the higher Part of <hi>Self,</hi> and ſo is more ſubtil and plauſible; but is there any more Love to God for himſelf, in the one than in the other?</p>
            <p>But I proceed to the Improvement of this Subject. And</p>
            <p n="1">1. Methinks what has been ſaid, ſerves to inform us of the Difficulty of Religion; and of the great Danger we are in of being deceiv'd, as to our State and Condition to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God. <hi>Surely ſtrait is the Gate, and narrow is the Way, that leads to Life and few there be that find it, there is a Generation that are pure in their own Eyes and yet are not cleanſed from their Filthineſs!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. From what has been ſaid we may learn, the abſolute Neceſſity of the New Birth, in order to ſerve God accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably here, and enjoy him hereafter! For without a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple above nature, we cannot aim at God above our ſelves. A Fountain may ſend out Water upon a Level with it ſelf, but not above the Level; and thus all that is done by us, while in a State of Nature, being done chiefly upon our own Account; it is but (in ſome Senſe) a ſerving of ourſelves, and therefore cannot be acceptable to God; and hence the Apoſtle aſſerts <hi>that he that is in the Fleſh cannot pleaſe God.</hi> The Church of <hi>England</hi> in their Articles of Faith, juſtly ſay,
<q>That Works done before the Grace of CHRIST, are not pleaſing to God, but have in them the Nature of Sin.</q> However tho' they be ſinful in reſpect of their Manner of
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:005500_0062_103967781138C0A0"/>
Performance, yet when we conform to the Command even in Externals, the Matter thereof is good, becauſe command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and it is in this Conformity that unconverted Sinners can only with Reaſon expect ſupernatural Grace; for <hi>Jehovah will be enquir'd of by the Houſe of Iſrael to do it for them.</hi> And</p>
            <p n="3">3. We may therefore learn, the Neceſſity of examining ourſelves; whether indeed we do aim at the Glory of God, in what we do? Now we may know this by the following Marks, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. When we are content to be outſhin'd by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in Gifts and Eſteem if ſo be God's Glory may be thereby advanced. (<hi>Phil.</hi> i. 15.) 2. When we habitually prefer God's Glory, to all other Things, that come at any Time in Competition with it, ſuch as Credit, Eſtate, Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 3. When in the General, we can be content, that God's Will ſhould take Place, tho' it croſs ours, (<hi>Mat.</hi> xxvi. 33. <hi>John</hi> xii. 28) 4. When the Reproaches that come upon God's Name, by the Falls of Profeſſors, &amp; declining State of Religion, diſtreſs us more for the General than all our worldly Concerns! 5. When we find at Times hard grapling, to come at this Diſpoſition, becauſe of the Oppoſition of ſelfiſh Corruptions. And can after experiencing the Work of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion feel ſometimes the witneſſing of our Conſcience <hi>that in Simplicity and Godly Sincerriy, we have had our Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the World.</hi> 2 Cor. i. 12. 6. When we feel the Love of CHRIST, ſometimes ſweetly conſtraining us to Duty. 7 when we bewail over the Remains of Hypocriſy in us!</p>
            <p n="4">4. If we find the aforeſaid Characters in us there is ground of Hope and Comfort for us; and tho' we have many Weakneſſes to lament, yet we are compleat in CHRIST, and <hi>he who hath begun a good Work in us, will carry it on to the Day of the Lord</hi> JESUS. <hi>He that ſeeth in ſecret, will</hi> by and by <hi>reward us openly, and make our Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhine as the Light, and our Judgment as the Noon Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="unknown:005500_0063_103967764B188BB0"/>But alas how doleful and dangerous is the Caſe of all that want the aforeſaid Signs! Their ſelfiſh Services are rejected, that <hi>God, who is a Spirit,</hi> caſts them back as Dung upon their Faces, he will at laſt tear off their Hypocritical Masks, and condemn their Perſons to eternal Burnings, except they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent! O conſider, with trembling thoſe dreadful Words of CHRIST, <hi>Mat</hi> xxv. <hi>Go ye accurſed into everlaſting Burnings, prepared for the Devil and his Angels!</hi> What ſhall become of thoſe who bring no Glory to God? But are as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeaks <hi>(aut Peccatum aut Sterilitas)</hi> either Sinfulneſs or Barreneſs, an unprofitable Burden to the Earth, and Poiſon to the Air! O let ſuch think on theſe ſolemn Words of our Lord, <hi>Mat.</hi> xxv. 30. <hi>Caſt ye the unprofitable Servant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to utter Darkneſs!</hi> And how diſmal is the Caſe of all ſuch, who by open Impieties bid Defiance to Heaven who declare their Sin as <hi>Sodom</hi> and refuſe to bluſh! <hi>Surely Indignation and Wrath ſhall be upon every Soul that doth Evil, upon the</hi> Jew <hi>firſt and alſo upon the</hi> Gentile! But what ſhall I ſay of thoſe Monſters of impiety, who caſt inglorious Reflections upon the very Work of God's holy Spirit, in convincing and converting Sinners, and comforting Saints? And call it <hi>Hypocriſy, Mechaniſm, Enthuſiaſm and Diſorder! Woe to theſe proud Potſherds that thus contend with their Maker, that like brute Beaſts ſpeak Evil of what they underſtand not!</hi> O let ſuch think on the Words of our Saviour to perſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me, it is hard for thee to kick againſt the Pricks!</hi> This Oppoſition is a dreadful Step, to the unpardonable Sin.</p>
            <p>In fine let us be all exhorted to aim at God's Glory and to glorify him. For this is of abſolute neceſſity, to obtain true Comfort, in Life, at Death and throughout Eternity!</p>

                  <p>All Scripture is given by Inſpiration of God, and is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs.</p>

            <p>THE Apoſtle having in the preceeding Verſes informed <hi>Timothy</hi> of the Apoſtacy of many from the Truth, and exhorted him to <hi>conſtancy</hi> in cleaving thereto, in the Face of all Oppoſition; does in the Words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, as a Mean and Motive, propoſe an ample <hi>Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the HOLY SCRIPTURES, in which we may obſerve, theſe Particulars,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. The Subject <hi>commended,</hi> all Scripture, <hi>(paſa graphe)</hi> i. e. <hi>all the Holy Scripture,</hi> not only the Old but the New Teſtament, in all their Parts. The Word <hi>Scripture</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies Writing. And</p>
            <p n="2">2d. We have the <hi>Commendation,</hi> which repreſents three Things, viz, the <hi>original, uſe,</hi> and <hi>deſign,</hi> of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>And 1ſt. The <hi>Original, it's given by Inſpiration (theo pucuſios) i. e.</hi> by the immediate and infallible guidance of the Holy Spirit, 2. Pet. i. 20, 21. <hi>Knowing this firſt, that no Propheſy of Scripture is of any private Interpretation, for
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:005500_0065_10396772D1B9DF50"/>
the Propheſy came not in old Time by the Will of Man, but Holy Men of old, ſpake as they were moved to it by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2d. The <hi>Uſe</hi> of the Holy Scriptures, they are <hi>profitable, (ophilemos)</hi> which does not only ſignify, a certain Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, as ſome imagine, but their <hi>Neceſſity, Sufficiency</hi> and <hi>Perfection!</hi> Here a fourfold profitableneſs of the Scriptures is mention'd, viz. 1ſt. For <hi>Doctrine, (pros didaſcalian)</hi> i. e. as Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> obſerves in his <hi>Synopſis, for Inſtruction in the ſound Truths of the Chriſtian Religion.</hi> The Original Word is derived from a Verb, that ſignifies <hi>to teach;</hi> this Senſe of the Word is confirm'd Rom. xv. 4. <hi>For whatſoever Things were written aforetime, were written for our Learning, that we thro' Patience and Comfort of the Scriptures might have Hope!</hi> Here obſerve, that the firſt <hi>Uſe</hi> of the ſacred Scriptures, is to <hi>inſtruct:</hi> And the firſt Duty of thoſe who Miniſter in Holy Things, is to <hi>Teach,</hi> and afterwards to <hi>Exhort.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus we may ſee, that every Religion that is not grounded upon Knowledge, is a falſe Religion! And that all ſuch who would work upon Men's Paſſions, and <hi>exhort</hi> them before they <hi>inſtruct</hi> their Minds, act contrary to the holy Scriptures, and to right Reaſon! Such do but delude Mankind, and build a Babel of Confuſion, but God is a God of Order, and not of Confuſion! But 2dly, the Scriptures are proffitable for <hi>reproof, (pros elenchon) i. e.</hi> to convince and confute Hereticks, and refel their Errors. This Word reſpects the polemical Uſe of the Scriptures, to convince gain-ſayers and ſtop their Mouths, Tit. i. 9, 11. <hi>Holding faſt the faithful Word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by ſound Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine both to exhort and convince the Gain-ſayers, whoſe mouths muſt be ſtop'd.</hi>—Here the Word <hi>Convince</hi> is the ſame in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, with that in the Text which is tranſlated <hi>Reproof,</hi> add hereto, that a Principal uſe of the Scriptures, is to convince
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:005500_0066_103967714D7A7C38"/>
               <hi>of Sin, of Righteouſneſs and of Judgment,</hi> Joh. xvi. 8.9. The original Word tranſlated <hi>Reprove,</hi> is the very ſame with that in our Text, and ſignifies to convince demonſtratively: Now altho' the holy Spirit is the efficient Cauſe of this, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whoſe energy the Word has no Influence upon Mens Minds, yet the Scriptures are the Inſtrumental Cauſe, for <hi>by the Law is the Knowledge of Sin.</hi> Now that the Reproof in the xvi. of <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, before mention'd, reſpects not only evil Actions, but a State of Sin, appears from theſe Words of our Lord in the 9th ver. <hi>of Sin, becauſe ye have not believed on me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3dly, For <hi>Correction, (proſs epanorthoſin)</hi> Correction pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſes Evil, and ſeeing that this is Two-fold, viz. either of <hi>Sin</hi> or <hi>Puniſhment,</hi> therefore Correction is alſo two-fold: By the one we are freed from the Evil of Sin, which is call'd <hi>Reprehenſion;</hi> and by the other from the Evil of Sorrow, which is call'd <hi>Conſolation.</hi> Both theſe the original Word <hi>(epanor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoſis)</hi> includes.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly, For <hi>Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs, (proſs paideian en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te dicaioſune)</hi> the Word <hi>(paideia)</hi> ſignifies both Inſtruction and Direction. The word <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> every <hi>moral Good.</hi> This Phraſe ſeems to import the exhortatory Uſe of the holy Scriptures, thoſe who have <hi>begun Well,</hi> the holy Scriptures both direct and exhort to perſiſt in their pious Courſe; and therefore in theſe four Uſes all the Buſineſs of the Scriptures is deſcrib'd.</p>
            <p>But 3dly, we have in theſe Words the End and Scope of the Scriptures, and that is, <hi>that the Man of God may be perfect, and thoroughly furniſhed.</hi>—Who are we to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by the <hi>Man of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> In general all pious People; but eſpecially Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel. The Word perfect <hi>(Artios)</hi> is explain'd by the following Sentence, the holy Scriptures give ſufficient
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:005500_0067_1039676FC1B1F1D8"/>
Direction for all Goodneſs of every kind, that may be call'd <hi>Perfect,</hi> which has all its Parts. It is the manner of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to uſe many Words in expreſſing that which they have a mind to impreſs on their Readers!</p>
            <p>In diſcourſing upon this Text of Scripture, I ſhall accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Order of it,</p>
            <p n="1">I. Labour to prove the <hi>divine Original of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi> And,</p>
            <p n="2">II. Speak <hi>of their Uſe.</hi> The</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. General Head of Diſcourſe, is <hi>the divine Original of the Scriptures,</hi> or to prove <hi>that they have been given forth by divine Inſpiration,</hi> and are therefore infallibly true, and of divine Authority. To this End let it be conſidered,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. That a divine Revelation is neceſſary, ſeeing that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teaches that there is a God, or ſome firſt Being, from whom are all things as their firſt Principle, and to whom all things tend, as their laſt End, and who is therefore above all. It is but reaſonable that this ſupream Being, ſhould be worſhiped if he is above all, more excellent than all, and we have received our All from him, (as it is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtibly evident;) then theſe Things ſhould be acknowledged with due Reverence, and what is this but the Worſhip of God? Surely he from whom our Beings and all our Benefits do proceed, has a juſt Right to our Homage and Service. And ſeeing he has made rational Creatures, in ſome ſort, capable of it, is it not reaſonable to conclude, that the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Being, who always acts with the wiſeſt Deſign, does and will require that moral Service for which he has given a Capacity? the Caſe muſt be ſo, otherwiſe the Almighty has given a Capacity to no Purpoſe, which is unworthy of his infinite Wiſdom!</p>
            <p>Well, ſeeing the Almighty does require ſome Worſhip and Service of his reaſonable Creatures; may we not infer
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:005500_0068_1039676E0C20DFA8"/>
from his infinite Goodneſs, that he has given them ſome certain and infallible rule, to direct them therein; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidering, that there are ſome things in Religion, which cannot be known by the Light of Nature, viz. all thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions which Spring from the meer Will or good Pleaſure of God, cannot be found out by the force of human Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without ſome ſpecial Revelation from God. As <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah</hi> makes his unatainted Purity manifeſt in moral Laws, ſo the Glory of his Sovereignty appears in his poſitive Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, reſpecting which his Pleaſure cou'd not be known with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome divine Revelation. And thus all that tribute of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which redounds to his Sovereignity thereby, would be entirely loſt; from all which Conſiderations, the neceſſity of ſome ſupernatural Revelation, ſome divine Law to direct Mankind in the Affairs of Religion, is of the laſt Neceſſity.</p>
            <p>Neither, 2dly. Is it impoſſible that the Almighty ſhould communicate his Mind and Will to his Creatures by imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Revelation: If a Creature can impart his Mind to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, much more the Creator; for ſurely there is no excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in Creatures, but what is eminently in him. If it is not inconſiſtent with the Glory and Majeſty of God to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and be preſent with all Things,</hi> then ſurely it cannot be injurious to his Honour to communicate his Mind to reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Creatures: Nay, on the contrary, it is an Indication of his Goodneſs and Wiſdom, to favour intelligent Creatures with ſuch intimations of his Will, as are ſuitable to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity he has given them, and ſubſervient to promote their Happineſs.</p>
            <p>Neither is it in any reſpect abſurd or impoſſible for the Almighty to communicate his Mind to Mankind by imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Revelation. Surely he that made the Soul can find eaſie acceſs to the Work of his own Hands, and form what Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions on it he pleaſes! If a finite Spirit can communicate its
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:005500_0069_1039676C1D764450"/>
Ideas to the Soul of Man, as all confeſs, except <hi>Sadduces,</hi> how much more can the Father of Spirits? To deny the reality of Inſpiration, is not only to reject the credibility of Scripture Hiſtory, but to confront the avoved Sentiments of the Pagan World, who all declar'd it to be agreeable to Reaſon!</p>
            <p>Having premis'd theſe few particulars, I ſhall proceed to mention thoſe Characters of Divinity which are impreſs'd on the Scriptures. And</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Methinks the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of the Scriptures, is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of their divine Authority: The Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> (next to the <hi>Decalogue</hi>) are the moſt ancient Writings in the World. This <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> who liv'd in the ſecond Centuary, and <hi>Euſebius</hi> after him, make fully evident. But the Words of <hi>Tertulian,</hi> in his Apology, are very memorable!
<q>Our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, <hi>ſays he,</hi> far out does all that you can boaſt of in that Kind; for the Books of one of our Prophets only, viz. <hi>Moſes,</hi> (wherein it ſeems God hath inclos'd, as in a Treaſury, all the Chriſtian Religion preceeding ſo many Ages together) reach beyond the antienteſt you have; even all your publick Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents, the Antiquity of your Originals, the eſtabliſhment of your Eſtates, the Foundations of your Cities, all that are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced by you in all Ages of Hiſtory and Memory of Times.— I think I may ſay more, they are older than your very Gods, your Temples, Oracles, and Sacrifices! Have you not heard mention made of that great Prophet <hi>Moſes,</hi> he was cotem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary with <hi>Inachus,</hi> and preceeded <hi>Danaus</hi> (the antienteſt of all that have a Name in your Hiſtories) <hi>393</hi> Years: He lived ſome hundred Years before the ruin of <hi>Troy;</hi> and <hi>Homer</hi> the oldeſt Writer among the <hi>Greeks;</hi> lived, as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſayeth, <hi>250</hi> Years after the ſubverſſion of that City. Every of the other Prophets, ſucceeded <hi>Moſes,</hi> and yet the laſt of them was
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:005500_0070_1039676A76F9AF48"/>
of the ſame Age with your prime wiſe Men, Law-givers and Hiſtorians! <hi>thus far he.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>It is certain, that neither the Writings <hi>'Homer, Triſmegiſtus, Pythagoras, Beroſus, Plutarch, Cicero, Seneca,</hi> or any other can vie with the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> for Antiquity! Now is it not Reaſonable to believe, that to be the beſt Religion which was firſt? Is not Truth always the firſt born? Is it not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to imagine that the moſt early Notices of Religion ſhould be counterfeit? How can it conſiſt with the divine Goodneſs to ſuffer Mankind to be thus impos'd upon, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of his Authority, in a Matter that concerns their everlaſting Intereſt, without any Thing from him, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before or ſince, to detect the Fraud? Certainly this is unworthy of God, and contrary to the Reaſon of Men; and therefore the Scriptures, being the moſt Antient, muſt needs proceed from the God of Truth. But</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Majeſtick Stile of the Holy Scriptures ſpeaks them to be of a Divine Original.</hi> The Stile of the Scripture is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry different from all human Writings, in it we find a ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly plaineſs, a majeſtick Simplicity, commanding Reverence from all intelligent Beings, who do without Prejudice at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend thereto. God is repreſented as ſpeaking with a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty, Grandeur, and Majeſty, becoming the Dignity of his Being and extent of his Government, <hi>e. g.</hi> Iſa. i. 2. <hi>Hear O Heavens! And give ear O Earth! For the Lord hath ſpoken.</hi> Iſa. lxvi 1. <hi>Thus ſayeth the Lord, the Heaven is my Throne, and the Earth my Foot-Stool!</hi> Iſa. xl. 12.15. <hi>Who hath meaſured the Waters in the Hallow of his Hand, and meeted out the Heavens with a Span; and comprehended the Duſt of the Earth in a Meaſure; and weighed the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in Scales, and the Hills in a Ballance; Behold the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are as a Drop of a Bucket, and are counted as the ſmall Duſt of the Ballance! Behold he taketh up the Iſles as a very
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:005500_0071_10396768D1EB3820"/>
little Thing,</hi> Pſ. lxxvi. 12. <hi>He ſhall cut of the Spirit of the Princes, He is terrible to the Kings of the Earth,</hi> Pſ. xcvii. 1, 5. <hi>The Lord reigneth let the Earth rejoyce, let the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Iſles be glad thereof. Clouds and Darkneſs are round about him, Righteouſneſs and Judgment, are the Habitation of his Throne, a Fire goeth before him, and burneth up his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies round about, His Lightnings enlightned the World, the Earth ſaw and trembled, the Hills melted like Wax, at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord, at the Preſence of the Lord of the whole Earth!</hi> Here are no Apologies, begging Pardon of the Reader, or any Arts us'd to inſinuate into his good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion as is common in human Writings. <hi>Aguſtine</hi> ſays,
<q>That the Holy Scriptures ſeem'd rude and unpoliſh'd to him, becauſe he did not underſtand its inward Beauty; but when converted to Chriſtianity, he declar'd, that when he underſtood them, no writing appear'd more wiſe and eloquent.</q> 
               <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> a Man of great Learning, when he became acquainted with the ſacred Scriptures, judged,
<q>All the Ornaments of Literature among the Greek Philoſophers, to be vaſtly inferior to them.</q> 
               <hi>Illiricus</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves,
<q>That altho' we find not in the Holy Scriptures, that delicate Itch of Words, that numeroſity of Sounds or thoſe pleaſing Trifles with which the vain glorious O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> beautify'd their fam'd Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues, yet we find there a grave and maſculine Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence exceeding all others.</q> Thus far he: 'Tis true a great Part of the Scripture is deſtitue of the Sweetneſs of Sound, and Pomp of Diction. But yet there is more Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in that plaineſs, than in all the Flowers of <hi>Ciceronian</hi> Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick. Neither would it become the Majeſty of Heaven, to uſe the Philoſophical Subtilties of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle!</hi> A Pearl needs no painting—A Prince need not play the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator! Plaineſs well becomes Royal Power and Majeſty in
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:005500_0072_103967672589A268"/>
the Publicaion of Laws. In the ſacred Scriptures, Commands are iſſu'd forth with Sovereign Majeſty, and Obedience perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily requir'd, and no other Reaſon aſſign'd but the Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators Will. Here are Promiſes to the Obedient, of all needful Bleſſings here, &amp; immortal Glory hereafter. Here are Threats denounced againſt the Diſobedient of every Order, from the Prince on the Throne to the Beggar on the Dunghil; and that of no leſs than eternal Miſeries! Here Injunctions are introduc'd, with a <hi>thus ſaith the Lord! He that hath Ears to hear let him hear.</hi> Where do we find any Thing like to this, in any human Writings?</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Matters therein treated of,</hi> are <hi>ſo ſublime and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent, that they could never be devis'd by a human Mind.</hi> Here the eſſential and perſonal Glory of the great Three ONE, is repreſented in a ſurpriſing Light. Here a rational and conſiſtent Account is given of the Original <hi>Source</hi> of that <hi>Depravity</hi> and Miſery, which taints and infeſts the whole human Race! <hi>viz.</hi> That both were occaſion'd by the Apoſtacy of <hi>Adam,</hi> the federal Head and Repreſentative of his whole Offspring. This the Pagans groan'd under, but aſcrib'd it to a Fabulous Cauſe! Here a <hi>Method</hi> of <hi>Cure</hi> is open'd, every Way worthy of God, and every Way ſuited to all the Maladies under which our fallen Nature labours! namely, that the Son of God ſhould aſſume the human Nature under its ruinous Circumſtances, into an inſeparable Union with his Deity, and therein mediate and ſatisfy for the Sins of Men, by his Suffering and Obedience! What finite Mind could invent a <hi>Scheme</hi> in which the Divine At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes ſhine forth with ſuch humble Beauty and harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing Glory? A <hi>Scene</hi> which gives Room for the diſplays of Sovereign Mercy, without infringing upon the unaliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Rights of Juſtice! Beſides the ſacred Scriptures give us a rational Account of the <hi>Origin</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of the World.
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:005500_0073_10396765A380FD40"/>
The infinite Grandeur of the Almighty is moſt nobly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, in the Manner of the Worlds Formation; he did but ſpeak and behold it exiſted, his ſingle ſovereign Beck cauſed it to ſpring in a Moment, from the Womb of empty Nothing into Being; and how awful and affecting is the Repreſentation which the Divine Oracles give us of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the Dead and the general Judgment! And where elſe can we find theſe ſolemn Scenes open'd, which are ſo terrible to the impenitent, and comforting to all that truly fear God?</p>
            <p n="4">4. That Holineſs the Scripture inculcates, is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of its divine Original. The divine Oracles do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recommend Holineſs in Speech and Practice, but in the inward Sentiments and Thoughts of the Soul; and that not only by its Precepts, which are juſt and equal, but by Threatnings of the moſt dreadful kind, and Promiſes of the moſt important Good; as well as by examples of moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemiſh'd Vertue and ſtricteſt Piety. The Words of Holy Scripture are pure as Silver try'd in a Furnace and purify'd ſeven Times. The moſt ſublime univerſal and perpetual Purity, is the golden Center to which all the Lines in the Circumference of Scripture bend and terminate. And it ought to be obſerved, that the ſacred Scripture urges a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, which ſprings from the nobleſt Principle, <hi>viz. LOVE;</hi> and aims at the higheſt End, <hi>viz. The Glory of God;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as divers of the Pagans have held a multiplicity of <hi>gods</hi> which is impoſſible in the Nature of Things, and obſerv'd impure Rites in their religious Worſhip, and allow'd of Revenge and Self Murder! And all their <hi>Motives</hi> to the Vertues they recommend, are of a ſelfiſh Nature. But the Scripture al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lures us to the Love and Practice of Vertue and Goodneſs, from the ſublime and endearing Conſideration of redeeming Love! I may add, that the Pagan Moraliſts, <hi>viz. Socrates,
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:005500_0074_10396763EB799BB0"/>
Plato, Plutarch, Seneca, Tully, Ariſtotle,</hi> are ſilent about Heart Purity, ſo far as I know, without which, a regular Life has but a Shew of Goodneſs. As to the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion it may be obſerv'd, that is was propagated among a barborous, rude and uncultivated People, and ſpread no farther than the Force of the Sword carried it. It is evident that <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the Author of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> did nothing to prove himſelf to be a Prophet: What Myſteries did he reveal? What Propheſies did he expreſs? What Miracles did he perform? How many Things in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> are contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory and ridiculous? Beſides its Precepts indulge Mens ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Inclinations with <hi>Polygamy</hi> here, and its Promiſes flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Men's vain Hopes with the Propoſal of a carnal Paradiſe hereafter; a Paradiſe more fit for Swine, than reaſonable and immortal Souls! Well if the Scriptures be abſolutely and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively Holy, and tend to make us ſo above all other Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, is it not an Argument of their divine Original? Surely Satan, who is an impure Spirit, would not invent what is ſo prejudicial to his Kingdom, nor the Wicked who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Influence: It can't be reaſonably ſuppos'd, that they would, if they could, deviſe a Syſtem of Doctrines and Laws which directly controls their corrupt Inclinations, and dooms them to perpetual Miſery for them! Nor can Angels or good Men be the Authors of the Scriptures, becauſe they would be guilty of frequent lying, in aſcribing to themſelves and their Sayings a Divinity, which the Scriptures frequently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to itſelf, therefore it muſt derive its Original from none elſe but God!</p>
            <p>The Neceſſity of ſome Divine Revelation has been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obſerved. And indeed he that denies this, does not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deny the Chriſtian and Jewiſh, but all Religion in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, for all have alledged this as their Foundation; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides he muſt acknowledge, that the Almighty has left Man

in a worſe Condition than the meaneſt Creature, to whom he has given ſufficient Means, to attain the higheſt End of their Beings: But ſure this is incompatible with infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goodneſs! If any ſhould ſay, that Reaſon may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, I anſwer no! It is corrupt, and therefore cannot be the Rule of Right, without a Revelation. The abſurd Opinions of many who have the Help of a Revelation, ſhows the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency of Reaſon without it, to be our Guide in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Matters; but if it be granted, that there is ſome Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, then ſurely it is the Chriſtian, for this alone bears the Character of Divinity; all the Reſt carry the manifeſt To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of Impoſture upon them, as has been before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd. But</p>
            <p n="5">5. That <hi>Harmony</hi> and <hi>Agreement</hi> which ſubſiſts betwen all the Parts of the ſacred Scriptures, is another Proof of their divine Authority. This bleſſed Book, was Sixteen Hundred Years a writing; it was written by a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Perſons of various Conditions, in different Tongues, in different Ages, in diſtant Places, and yet all the Parts whether Hiſtorical, Prophetical, Perceptive, Promiſory, Minatory, Typical, Doctrinal, ſweetly harmonize and tend to the ſame noble End! This could never be the Iſſue of human Contrivance; it muſt needs be the Reſult of infinite Preſcience, and divine Guidance! How often do uninſpir'd Men contradict themſelves in their Writings, and how much more would they contradict one another? If many Perſons of inferior Attainments, did at various Times and Places write upon religious Subjects, conſidering their natural Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in ſuch Matters, and their lyableneſs to blunder, even in reporting Matters of Fact; and indeed if the Penmen of the Scriptures had been left to themſelves, in the Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, the Bible would have been but a Bundle of Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Contradiction, But</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="73" facs="unknown:005500_0076_10396760749303D0"/>6. Another Argument for the divine Original of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, may be taken from the <hi>Penmen</hi> thereof; and here it may be aſſerted, that they were Men of ſuch blameleſs Lives, that their Enemies could not fix ſuch Charges upon them as might juſtly weaken the Credit of their Writings. It is likewiſe evident, that they were Men of great Candor and Integrity, and that from their diſcovering their own Faults, <hi>Moſes</hi> Records his Backwardneſs to comply with the divine Call of going to <hi>Egypt,</hi> his Infidelity, his Murmurings, (<hi>Num.</hi> xi. 11, 15.) and <hi>Jeremy</hi> informs us, of his curſing <hi>the Day of his Birth, Jer.</hi> xx. <hi>David</hi> makes mention of his Crime in the Matter of <hi>Uriah, (Pſal.</hi> li.) nay they do not only mention their own Crimes, but thoſe of their deareſt Relations; which carnal Policy would have inclin'd them to conceal; thus <hi>Moſes</hi> mentions his Brother <hi>Aaron's</hi> making the <hi>Golden-Calf. (Exod.</hi> xxxii 25.) They alſo acquaint us, with the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs of their Extraction, thus <hi>Amos</hi> tells us that he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Herdſmen of <hi>Tekoah;</hi> the Evangeliſts inform us that they were Seafaring Men, when call'd to be Diſciples.</p>
            <p>Neither were the Penmen of the Scriptures, deſigning Men, they ſought not their own Honour, as appears from what has been ſaid, neither did they ſeek their own Intereſt. Altho' <hi>Moſes</hi> had the Burden of Government, yet he did not affect the pomp of a King, neither did he advance his Family to that Wealth and Honour which was in the Power of his Hand to confer! No, the Laws he made, depriv'd his own Tribe of kingly Government, and the higheſt Honour of the Prieſthood he conferred on his Brothers Children, not his own! Its certain that Inſtead of Honour and Profit, many of the Penmen of the Scriptures, expoſed themſelves by their writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and preaching to great Contempt and Hardſhips!</p>
            <p>Beſides many of the Penmen of the Scriptures, were of ſuch Inferior Abilities that they were not able to form an
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:005500_0077_1039675EF2C59AB8"/>
Impoſture and palm it on the World. And ſome of them were Kings, and ſo above the ſneaking Meaneſſes of Lying and Forgery! And to conclude this Argument, I may far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obſerve that the very Writers of the Scriptures appear to be under a Subjection to the Doctrines they delivered, which argues them to be of a divine Original! But</p>
            <p n="7">7. The <hi>exact accompliſhment</hi> of <hi>Propheſies,</hi> proves the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of the Scriptures; to foretel Events that depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on arbitrary Cauſes, exceeds the reach of a human Mind, and is the Prerogative of that God only, who is <hi>panophthal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos,</hi> all eye and has no Succeſſion in Duration; but there are many Inſtances of this kind in Scripture, <hi>e. g. Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> foretold the Idolatrous Apoſtacy of Iſrael, (<hi>Deut.</hi> xxxi. 29. <hi>Joſ.</hi> xxiii 15.) which the Book of Judges ſhews was accompliſhed. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> foretold the <hi>Babel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſh</hi> Captivity, with the Time of its Continuance, and the Deliverance from it by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> which accordingly came to paſs, as other Parts of the Old-Teſtament do witneſs. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of a Reformation by <hi>Joſiah,</hi> and his burning the Bones of the Idolatrous Prieſts at <hi>Bethel,</hi> did exactly come to paſs three Hundred Years after. (1 <hi>Kings</hi> xiii. 2. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> xxiii, 15, 16.) And many Propheſies reſpecting the Time and Manner of our SAVIOUR'S coming, his Birth, Life, Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and Death, are punctually fulfilled. It was near two Thouſand Years, before that famous Prophiſy, (<hi>Gen.</hi> xlix. 10.) had its Accompliſhment, <hi>Hircanus</hi> was the laſt of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> who ſway'd the Scepter of Government over the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and this Man <hi>Herod</hi> a Stranger, an <hi>Idumean</hi> ſlew; and ſo cut off the Line of <hi>Judah,</hi> and uſurp'd the Government, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> teſtifies; and then did the MESSIAS come. An ingenious Writer gloſſeth excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the aforeſaid Prophecy, in the following Manner. The Jewiſh Rabbins ſayeth he,
<q>do not deny that by <hi>SHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOH</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="unknown:005500_0078_1039675D71570AE0"/>
is meant the <hi>MESSIAH;</hi> now at the Time of <hi>Jacob's</hi> uttering theſe Words, there was little Probability that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Poſterity ſhould have a Sceptre,—being poor, few, and in a ſtrange Land; or if they ſhould thrive ſo as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Kingdom, why ſhould <hi>Judah</hi> have the Government? Seeing there were three elder Brothers, viz. <hi>Reuben, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon,</hi> and <hi>Levi;</hi> nor was there any likelihood of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy's being accompliſh'd when <hi>Moſes</hi> ſet it down in Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for then he himſelf who was of the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> was in the actual Poſſeſſion of the Government, and put into it by God himſelf, who appointed for his ſucceſſor <hi>Joſhua,</hi> not of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> but of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> whence we have a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Evidence, of the Truth and Sincerity of this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: For had not <hi>Jacob</hi> really uttered it, we cannot imagine that <hi>Moſes</hi> would have put it in Writing, to the Diſparagement of his own Tribe.</q> Thus far he.</p>
            <p>We ſee with our Eyes the ingathering of the Gentiles, and Diſperſion of the Jews! But the Time would fail to relate the accompliſhment of thoſe numerous Propheſies that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect our SAVIOUR: I muſt therefore proceed to obſerve.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That God himſelf has atteſted the Divinity of the Scriptures by <hi>Miraculous Works,</hi> and ſurely if we receive the Witneſs of Men, the Witneſs of God is greater. A Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle is an extraordinary divine Work, whereby ſomething is produc'd contrary to the common Courſe and fixed Laws of Nature! Now that many ſuch have been wrought by the Prophets, by CHRIST, and the Apoſtles, for the Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Divinity of their Miſſion and Doctrine, we have all the Evidence that ſuch paſt Facts will admit of, and more cannot be reaſonably deſir'd. <hi>Elijah</hi> expreſly appeal'd to God for the Determination of the Controverſy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and the Prieſts of <hi>Baal,</hi> by a miraculous Work, and our Lord appeal'd to the Miraculous Works

We have Information by many credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and diſintereſted Witneſſeſs, that the Miracles which our Lord wrought, were many in Number, beneficent in Kind, that they were wrought before Multitudes of Enemies, who, had there been any fraud, would ſurely have detected it. They were wrought frequently in open Day, and of this the Relators were Eye and Ear Witneſſes. A Miracle is certainly the broad Seal of Heaven, which could never be given to a forgery! And therefore, as Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> obſerves,
<q>When any Doctrine which is in itſelf ſuch as becometh Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Righteouſneſs, is confirm'd by a Miracle, there can no greater Aſſurance be given even by God himſelf of its veracity!</q> Could the infernal Spirits imitate the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Works which our Saviour wrought? Is it not utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the divine Goodneſs to ſuffer them to uſe the Seal of Heaven in ſeducing Mankind, without giving ſome evident Notices of the Impoſture, but this has never been done in this Caſe: The <hi>Turks</hi> do acknowledge the Miracles of our Lord, and the <hi>Jews</hi> alſo; but the latter aſcribe them, thro' Malice, to the Power of Magick! But then, as our Saviour juſtly obſerves, <hi>Satan would be divided againſt Satan, and ſo his Kingdom could not ſtand!</hi> Satan would do that which is contrary to his Intereſt, which is abſurd! <hi>Irenius,</hi> who lived in the ſecond Century, affirmeth, <q>That the the Dead were raiſed to Life, and other Miracles wrought in his time, by laying on of Hands.</q> And <hi>Tertulian,</hi> in his Apology, hath theſe Words, <q>Let any one be brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your Tribunal who is apparently poſſeſs'd with a Devil, that Spirit being commanded by any Chriſtian, ſhall confeſs himſelf to be a Devil.</q> But to proceed,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="unknown:005500_0080_103967599AFFAAB8"/>Another Argument of the Divinity of the Scriptures, is their <hi>almoſt miraculous Preſervation</hi> for ſo long a tract of Time, notwithſtanding the rage of numerous, powerful and politick Oppoſers, while many other eſteemed Compoſures, which never met with ſuch Oppoſition, have long ſince periſhed. <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> in the Days of the <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabes,</hi> made diligent ſearch for the Book of the Law, and where ever he found it, burnt it, and threatned thoſe that conceal'd it with Death and Torture. And about the Year of CHRIST 300, the Emperor <hi>Diocleſian</hi> being determined to root Chriſtianity out of the World, us'd the ſame Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities to deſtroy the Scriptures. But the gracious God has preſerv'd them to this Day, maugre the combin'd rage of Hell, and Earth! yea to preſerve them whole and entire, ſo that thoſe to whom they were committed, have not been ſuffered to corrupt them, altho' they fell into Opinions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with them, they have therefore fled to <hi>unwritten Traditions</hi> as the <hi>Patron</hi> of their erronious Opinions. The Jews to their <hi>Talmud</hi> and <hi>Cabala,</hi> which, they ſay, <hi>Moſes</hi> delivered by Word of Mouth. And the <hi>Papiſts</hi> to <hi>oral Traditions,</hi> which they ſay were delivered by St. <hi>Peter.</hi> But I proceed to obſerve,</p>
            <p>That the <hi>early Succeſs</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> notwithſtanding of all the Oppoſition and Contempt which was made againſt it, and caſt upon it, gives aditional Force to what has been before offer'd. What leſs then Omnipotence cou'd make ſuch ſelf denying Doctrines, preach'd by illiterate Men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come victorious over the Pride and Prejudice of multitudes of divers Nations, and that without the Arts of Perſuaſion or Influence of civil Power?</p>
            <p>And indeed that divine <hi>Energy</hi> that does frequently <hi>attend</hi> the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> is a pregnant Argument of their divine Authority. By theſe the Minds of Men are enlightned, their Conſciences alarm'd, their Hearts comforted and renew'd,
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:005500_0081_10396757F5E9AE78"/>
having their general Byaſs turn'd towards God, and Heavenly Objects, and their Lives reform'd! Theſe Effects which have appear'd in Millions of Men, do ſurpaſs the Force of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and muſt therefore be aſcrib'd to an omnipotent Cauſe. And is it conſiſtent with the Wiſdom and Holineſs of God to uſe a forgery to produce ſuch noble Effects, and thereby to confirm an impoſture? no ſurely! moſt certainly the Almighty uſes Inſtruments adapted to the Effects pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. <hi>Tuly</hi> juſtly complains, <q>
                  <hi>That the</hi> Pagan Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, wanted Authority to enforce their Sentiments and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and that they were rather for Oſtentation then Practice.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed the general Tendency and Scope of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scripture, being to <hi>exalt God</hi> and <hi>abaſe the Creature,</hi> is no inconſiderable Argument of its divine Original. Had Men been the Contrivers, they would have fram'd a Scheme more agreeable to their corrupt Inclinations! They would have repreſented it as an eaſy Matter to be ſaved, and that the Creature is not ſo beholden to the Almighty for his Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs as the Scriptures ſignify.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe the conſtant <hi>Teſtimony</hi> both of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> to the Truth of the Scriptures, ſerves to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and illuſtrate our preſent Argument. Here let it be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that the Truth of Chriſtianity depends much upon certain Facts, ſuch as the Miracles which CHRIST wrought, and his Reſurrection from the Dead. Theſe the Apoſtles were eye Witneſſes of, and had there been any fallacy in them, could have eaſily diſcover'd it; for the Connexion we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in their Writings, proves that they had the regular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of their Reaſon. Now how can it be ſuppos'd, that Men in their Senſes would conſtantly aſſert what they knew to be falſe, and that in the face of Danger, when they had no Proſpect of Honour or Intereſt by ſo doing? But on the Contrary, of Reproach, Poverty and Pain, and at laſt Seal
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:005500_0082_103967567118EC88"/>
it with their Blood! To which let me add, the conſtant Teſtimony of Millions of Men ever ſince, many of whom ſuffer'd great Hardſhips, yea and Death itſelf, rather than they would deny the Truth of the Scriptures!</p>
            <p>Beſides ſome learned Men obſerve, That divers Matters of Fact recorded in Scripture, are alſo acknowledged by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Hiſtorians, e. g. <q>The Creation of the World, by <hi>Ovid</hi> in his Metamorphoſis. The long Lives of the Patriarchs, by <hi>Manetho.</hi> The Flood, by <hi>Beroſus.</hi> Noah, by <hi>Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> under the Name of <hi>Janus.</hi> The Deſtruction of <hi>Sodom,</hi> by <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Juſtin.</hi> Circumciſion, by <hi>Herodotus, Strabo, Diodorus, Siculus,</hi> and <hi>Tacitus.</hi> Iſraels departure out of Egypt, by the antient Record of the <hi>Egyptians, Phenicians, Caldeans,</hi> and <hi>Grecians.</hi> Mention is made of <hi>Solomon,</hi> by <hi>Dioniſius Caſius.</hi> Of the Slaughter of <hi>Senacherib,</hi> by <hi>Herodotus.</hi> The famous Roman Hiſtorian <hi>Tacitus,</hi> in his Annals, ſpeaking of <hi>Nero's</hi> Perſecuting the Chriſtians, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of their burning the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſays ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, <hi>That the Author of that Name or Sect, was CHRIST, who when</hi> Tiberius <hi>was Emperor, was put to Death by</hi> Pontius Pilate, <hi>the then Procurator of Judea.</hi> The Appearance of the Star is mention'd by <hi>Calcidius. Herod</hi>'s Slaughter of the Children, by <hi>Marcrobius.</hi> The Eclipſe of the Sun at our Lord's Crucifixion, by <hi>Dioniſius</hi> the Areopagite.</q> 
               <hi>Tertulian,</hi> in his Apology, appeals to the <hi>Roman Records</hi> for the certainty of it. And <hi>Joſephus</hi> in his Hiſtory, gives Teſtimony to the Miracles of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
            <p>Once more, if the Scriptures were not of divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, wherefore do wicked Men rage ſo much againſt them? and why are we aſſayled with ſo many Temptations from Satan to doubt and object when we apply ourſelves to the ſerious Study of them? Would Satan ſo much oppoſe them
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:005500_0083_10396754D1811058"/>
above all other Books, did they not come from God and tend to deſtroy his Kingdom? No ſurely!</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding of all that hath been ſaid in order to give us full Satisfaction, there is a neceſſity of the internal Teſtimony of the holy Spirit, whereby Perſons are made to feel the Power of the Scriptures, forming holy Diſpoſitions and ſweet Senſations in them, anſwerable thereunto, and thereby enabling them to believe its divine Authority, and hence it is ſaid, <hi>that thoſe who believe have the Witneſs in themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I proceed to ſpeak, and that but briefly, of the 2d. General Head, which was to diſcourſe upon <hi>the Uſe of the Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I may ſummarily obſerve, that the ſacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are the perfect and only Rule of our Faith and Practice. Hence in our Text they are ſaid <hi>to make the Man of God perfect and thoroughly furniſh'd to every good Work;</hi> and hence they are call'd <hi>a Light to our Feet and a Lamp to our Paths,</hi> and expreſſly, a Rule, Gal. 6.16. <hi>And as many as walk according to this Rule, Peace be upon them, and Mercy, and upon the Iſrael of God.</hi> From this we muſt not ſwerve to the right or left Hand. <hi>Iſa.</hi> viii. 20. <hi>To the Law and to the Teſtimony, if they ſpeak not according to this Word, it is becauſe there is no Light in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed the holy Scriptures, have <hi>only</hi> the Nature and Property's of a Rule, which are theſe following, 1ſt. a Rule ought to be <hi>preſcrib'd</hi> by God alone. <hi>Mat.</hi> xv. 9. A Religious Rule cannot be preſcrib'd by another than him to whom the Perſons ruled belong. And indeed the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blimity of the matter which ſuch Rules concern, ſufficiently manifeſt, that they cannot be well made by Creatures.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, A <hi>Rule</hi> ought to be <hi>receiv'd</hi> and <hi>Publick,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe how ſhall it determine Controverſies? And thus it is in
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:005500_0084_103967534C68E528"/>
reſpect of the Scriptures, they have been preſcrib'd by the publick Authority of God himſelf, and receiv'd by the common Conſent of the Chriſtian Church, as has been before prov'd; and hence the Church is call'd the <hi>Pillar</hi> and <hi>Ground</hi> of Truth, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> iii. 15.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, A <hi>Rule</hi> ought to be <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>plain,</hi> otherwiſe how can we know what we have to believe and do? And ſo are the Scriptures, eſpecially in the Explication of ſuch Things, as are of abſolute neceſſity to Salvation. And hence they are call'd <hi>a Light,</hi> and ſaid <hi>not to be hid from us, Dut.</hi> xxx. 11. Where we meet with Obſcurity, this ariſes from the Sublimity of the Things treated of, or the Weakneſs of our underſtanding rather than from the Scriptures themſelves.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly, A Rule ought to be <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>adequate,</hi> or equal to the <hi>Thing ruled,</hi> ſo that it need never to be augmented or diminiſh'd in the leaſt, otherwiſe it will be unfit to meaſure its Object. Such is the Holy Scripture, there is nothing to be believ'd or done, but what it contains and preſcribes. Now the Perfection of the Scriptures is two-fold, viz. <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegral</hi> or <hi>Syſtematical,</hi> and <hi>Eſſential,</hi> the firſt conſiſts in its full Number of Books, which is now compleat and the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Seal'd, (<hi>Rev.</hi> xxii. 18.19.) the latter reſpects the Doctrine contain'd in thoſe Books; and this moſt certainly is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, as our Text aſſerts, and many other Places. And hence we are bound to the Scripture alone as our Guide, by the ſtricteſt Injunctions. (<hi>Deut.</hi> xvii. 18. <hi>Iſa.</hi> viii. 20.) And forbid to add to it or detract from it, under the ſevereſt Penalty's! (<hi>Deut.</hi> iv. 2. <hi>Rev.</hi> xxii. 18.19.) And inform'd that we ſhall be at laſt judg'd by it. <hi>John</hi> xii. 42. And Reaſon will inform us, that it muſt be perfect, ſeeing that it is the firſt Principle, and laſt Explication of our Faith. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> i. 20, 21. If it were not ſo, true and perfect Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions cou'd not be drawn from it, for the Effect cannot be
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:005500_0085_1039675156A9B648"/>
better then its Cauſe. The ſacred Scripture has all its eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Parts, viz. <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Form,</hi> and all its integral, viz. <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and is therefore Perfect.</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. A Rule ought to be <hi>conſtant</hi> and <hi>imoveable,</hi> ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more and every where like to itſelf, otherwiſe how can any certain Meaſure be rul'd by it, and ſuch is the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, 2 <hi>Pet,</hi> i. 19. <hi>We have a more ſure Word of Propheſy, (bebaioteron propheticon logon.)</hi>

            <p>Now the aforeſaid Characters cannot be juſtly aſcrb'd to any thing elſe, that is obtruded for a Rule either by <hi>Jews, Papiſts, Turks, Pagans, Deiſts, Quakers, Antimonians:</hi> The Jewiſh <hi>Talmud</hi> and <hi>Cabula</hi> are private Things, deſtitute of divine Authority, full of Abſurdities, Falſehoods and Impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties againſt God and Man, as <hi>Gallatinus</hi> and <hi>Sextus Senenſis</hi> have made evident. The <hi>oral Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> is of the ſame Stamp, they are extreamly uncertain, for while ſome of the Fathers aſſert a particular Tradition to be Apoſtolical, others of them deny it. They are alſo contrary to the Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Word, and many of them changed according to the Circumſtances of Times, Places, and Perſons. The <hi>Turkiſh Alcoran</hi> is alſo utterly deſtitute of the aforeſaid Characters; the Author of it was a Monſter of Luſt, having eleven Wives at one Time, beſides Concubines, a baſe Adulterer and a cruel Robber, as <hi>Andreas Maurus</hi> in his Treatiſe againſt them, makes evident; and he was alſo an encourager of Robbery in his followers, as appears from the 19 and 71 <hi>Surat</hi> of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and in many Things it contradicts the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. The <hi>Pagan Moraliſts</hi> are likewiſe abſurd and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory in many Things, as I have obſerved before. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can <hi>Reaſon</hi> be our <hi>Rule,</hi> as the <hi>Deiſts</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> dream; becauſe it is obſcure and imperfect, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ii. 14.) And the abſurd and contrary Sentiments of thoſe who had no other Guide, is a ſufficient Confirmation of this. Beſides,

ſome Things in Religion are Sublime and Myſterious, and ſo tranſcend the reach of Reaſon; yet they are not contrary to it: But tho' on the one Hand, we diſclaim the <hi>Socinian</hi> Opinion, in making Reaſon the ſupream Rule of Faith and Practice; yet on the other we equally deteſt the Foolry of <hi>Enthuſiaſts,</hi> who reject it altogether in the Affairs of Religion. Surely Religion <hi>is a reaſonable Service;</hi> Reaſon may and ought to be humbly us'd, in order to underſtand the meaning of the Rule God has given us. The <hi>Quakers</hi> notion, of the <hi>Spirit</hi> without the Word to be be our Rule, is a dangerous <hi>ignis fatuous,</hi> which may lead Men any where. Neither is the pretended <hi>new Nature</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> of the <hi>Antinomians</hi> and <hi>Moravians,</hi> while they reject the Bleſſed Law of God and ſlight the Old Teſtament, a whit ſafer Guide then <hi>will with the Wiſp!</hi> Chriſt <hi>has not come to deſtroy the Law</hi> as theſe Men pretend; <hi>neither does Faith make void the Law!</hi>

We may be excited to the aforeſaid Love, by conſidering the Perfections of their Author, the Excellency of the Doctrines contain'd in them, with their Tendency and manifold Uſe, <hi>They are the Wiſdom and Power of God to Salvation.

            <p>THE Knowledge of the divine Exiſtence is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all Religion, without this we cannot come to God, and ſincerely ſeek his Favour; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it appears by the Law of Contraries, that the denial of a Supream Being muſt needs be the fatal Source of all Impiety and Perfidy. And this the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> confirms <hi>Pſalm</hi> 10.4. <hi>The Wicked through the Pride of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance will not ſeek after God: God is not in all his Thoughts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Evidences of a ſupream Being, are ſo many and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that it muſt needs be an Inſtance of the greateſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and impiety to call it in Queſtion: And yet this our Text informs us is the Practice of ſome, whoſe Character and Courſe we have therein a Deſcription of, <hi>the Fool.</hi> This ignominious Epithet or Character is frequently and juſtly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to wicked Men in Scripture; for the Contraries of true Wiſdom realy belong to them, as appears thus, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom directs to an End in the full Enjoyment of which we are compleatly Happy, as well as to Means that directly tend thereto, and excites to the Improvement of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Means in their proper Seaſon; whereas ungodly Perſons either propoſe to themſelves an End which cannot yield compleat Satisfaction, namely ſome earthly Entertainment;
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:005500_0090_10396749251DD8A8"/>
or if they propoſe the Enjoyment of God in a future World as their End; they purſue contrary Meaſures to attain it, <hi>viz.</hi> Sin and Impiety, and poſtpone the earneſt Uſe of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Means to ſecure an Inteteſt in the divine favour, until the golden Seaſons of divine Grace are elapſed, It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a property of true Wiſdom, to exert principal Care and Labour to ſecure the moſt valuable and enduring Good, and to avert the greateſt Evil: Whereas impenitent Tranſgreſſors on the Contrary, bend their principal Labour and Solicitude in queſt of Trifles, which are of no Importance and Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; while in the mean Time they are ſupinely and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſely Negligent of immence and immortal Good, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by expoſe themſelves to interminable Miſery, and intolerable Vengeance! But this methinks is one of the moſt aſtoniſhing Inſtances of the folly of Impenitents, which our Text records, namely, their queſtioning the Exiſtence of a ſupream Being, <hi>the Fool hath ſaid in his Heart:</hi> This Expreſſion ſeems to denote rather a Deſire that there was no God, than a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief that there is none. When Perſons go on in a courſe of crimſon Impiety, as it is ſaid <hi>of the Fool</hi> in our Text, <hi>they are corrupt, they have done abominable Works.</hi> Then they are diſpoſed to Queſtion the Exiſtence of an aveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Judge, that ſo they may Sin without Controul or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance: Doubtleſs ſome refactory Tranſgreſſors inceſſantly labour entirely to extinguiſh the native Notices of a ſupream Being in their Minds, that ſo they may give a lawleſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded looſe to their ſenſitive Appetites, without the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy allay of a future Judgment.</p>
            <p>In diſcourſing on this Text I purpoſe 1ſt. To prove <hi>the Being of a God</hi> by ſome Arguments. And</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>To expoſe the</hi> Atheiſts <hi>folly in Queſtioning it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And 1ſt. Methinks the Subordination of Cauſes which we behold, and their Succeſſion, manifeſtly point to a firſt
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:005500_0091_10396747A3A7BB38"/>
Cauſe; there hath been for ſome ſtanding of Time, and there yet is, a ſucceſſion of Creatures in the World: Now theſe Creatures cannot make themſelves, for that which is not, cannot act: Nothing cannot be the Cauſe of ſomething. To ſuppoſe a Creature could produce itſelf, involves a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Abſurdity in it, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is, and is not at the ſame Time, and that it acts before it exiſts, which is impoſſible: As it produces it muſt be, for nothing cannot act; and as it is produc'd, it muſt not be, and as theſe Creatures cannot make themſelves, ſo neither can they make each other, for this Reaſon, becauſe to create Something out of Nothing, is a Work that requires infinite Strength. (the diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween nothing and ſomething being infinite) Now no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath this Property of Almightyneſs, therefore it cannot act contrary to the fixed Laws of Nature in Creating: All that a Creature can do is only, in a natural Way, to give particular Forms to fit Materials, but the Matter itſelf he cannot produce. If the Creature could make himſelf, then it would follow, by a parity of Reaſon, that he could preſerve himſelf, for the latter is no greater than the former. But manifold Experience proves the latter to be falſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the former is ſo from which this proceeds.</p>
            <p>But farther, upon the ſuppoſition of the Creatures making himſelf and others, it may be enquir'd, why he has made himſelf and thoſe of the ſame Species, ſo Indigent and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant on other Creatures for Support? Likewiſe how it comes to paſs that he knows ſo little of himſelf and others? Surely he that makes Things muſt needs Underſtand them: From all which it appears, that Man could not make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and other Creatures.</p>
            <p>But to bring this Argument reſpecting the Succeſſion of Creatures, to a Criſis, it may be obſerv'd, that one or other
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:005500_0092_10396745CCDB07E8"/>
of theſe <hi>four</hi> Particulars reſpecting it will hold good <hi>viz.</hi> Either that the Succeſſion is Infinite, or that the ſame Thing produces it ſelf, or that there is a Circulation of Cauſes, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>A</hi> ſhould be the Cauſe of <hi>B, B</hi> of <hi>C, C</hi> of <hi>D,</hi> and <hi>D</hi> of <hi>A</hi> again, or ſome firſt Being who proceeds from none, whom we call <hi>GOD,</hi> there is not a fifth. Now the Three firſt Particulars cannot be admitted without Contradiction, as for Example, an infinite Subordination or Succeſſion of Cauſes, 1ſt. infers that while that continues nothing can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt, than which nothing can be more falſe: Now the Juſtneſs of the aforeſaid Conſequence appears thus, <hi>viz.</hi> nothing can exiſt except by its next Cauſe, which produces the Effect; But if an infinite Number of Cauſes muſt preceed the next Cauſe, that next Cauſe would never exiſt, for there is no end to Infinity, and then it would follow, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nothing now exiſts, which is abſurd, and then 2dly That which is infinite would be rendered more, inaſmuch as to the ſuppoſed infinity of Cauſes we ſee daily new ones added, and thus there would be an infinite which was not Infinite, which is abſurd; and further 3dly That order of prior and poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior which is in ſucceſſion would be deſtitute of a firſt, from which all Flux or Motion in its own Nature exiſts; where there is not a firſt there cannot be a ſecond or third, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can there be a ſecond or third, where there is not a firſt; and hence there would be a Succeſſion, which is not a Succeſſion; which is abſurd: Therefore an infinite Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion can by no Means be allow'd; neither can it be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted without the greateſt Abſurdity, that a Creature can produce it ſelf for the Reaſons aforeſaid. If an Atheiſt ſhould object and ſay, that according to our Opinion God is of himſelf, we anſwer, it is true, He is of himſelf, yet he has not produced himſelf, He is of himſelf <hi>negatively,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as he is produced by no other; but he is not of
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:005500_0093_10396743F1042438"/>
himſelf <hi>poſitively,</hi> ſo as to produce himſelf; and if the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Circulation of Cauſes were admitted, then the ſame Creature would indirectly and mediately produce himſelf, inaſmuch as <hi>A</hi> by <hi>B, C,</hi> and <hi>D,</hi> would be the Cauſe of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. If the Atheiſt againſt the aforeſaid Reaſonings objects, that we do not ſee the Sun, Moon, and Stars to be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by others, to this it may be reply'd, that altho' we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not by our Senſes that thoſe have been produced, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs by reaſon we may certainly infer this, and that from the following Topick, <hi>viz.</hi> We obſerve all theſe Things to be finite, and ſeeing that nothing can limit itſelf and its own Perfection, it is neceſſary that it ſhould derive its Being and Limitations therein from another. But more particularly, A</p>
            <p n="2">2d. Argument to prove the Being of God is this, <hi>viz.</hi> The World is created, therefore God exiſts: Here we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe what no Atheiſt will deny, <hi>viz.</hi> That the World ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, well then this World that now exiſts has either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced itſelf, or has been from Eternity, not produced or is produced by another, and that either of ſomewhat pre-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting, or of Nothing: If the latter holds, it is created, for Creation is but a Production of Something out of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Now to enforce this Argument let us briefly conſider its Parts, and 1. that the World did not produce it ſelf appears from what has been before obſerved: For then it would be and not be at the ſame Time, which is impoſſible from the Nature of Things. And 2dly that it did not exiſt from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, the following Particulars demonſtrate</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Eternity is an Infinity, which a finite World is unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of: If the Atheiſt affirms the World to be infinite, he may be eaſily confuted from the Parts of the World, which are either infinite or finite; if they be ſaid to be infinite,
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:005500_0094_103967426E81F1E0"/>
then there are many Infinites and by Conſequece none, which is abſurd; each Part would have all the Perfection of the Parts joyned with it, or not: If yea, then they would not be different, but one and the ſame, which our Eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the Parts of the World prove to be falſe, if nay, then it would not be infinite, but finite, and if the Parts of the World, be finite how can it ſelf be infinite, can finite Cauſes produce an infinite Effect? No ſurely! that is contrary to the Nature and Reaſon of Things.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the World exiſted from Eternity, then an infinite Number of Years, which Eternity implies, muſt neceſſarily have preceeded this Day, and ſeeing that Number could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have been compleat, by conſequence this Day could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſucceed, but we ſee it does ſucceed; And</p>
            <p n="3">3. From the Suppoſition of the Worlds Eternity it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that ſomething can be added to what is infinite, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that there is an infinite which is not infinite, which is Ridiculous! For is not Eternity an infinite Duration, and yet according to the aforeſaid Hypotheſis, Years, Months and Days are added to it; from which it follows, that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite can be more than infinite, inaſmuch as the World which was before one Thouſand Years agone infinite in Duration, is now older, therefore it cannot be that the World ſhould exiſt from Eternity.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Corruptibility of the Parts of the World, proves that it is not eternal, for what exiſts externally exiſts of it ſelf, and ſo exiſts neceſſarily, and thus is not liable to Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That which borrows its Being of no other needs not &amp; ſo depends not upon any other for the Continuation of its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, for that no other can deſtroy. But we ſee the Caſe is contrarywiſe with the Parts of the World, and therefore it is not eternal. <hi>It muſt neceſſarily be acknowledged</hi> ſays
<q>
                  <pb n="92" facs="unknown:005500_0095_10396740EC3DD9F8"/>Lucretius, that the World had a Beginning, otherwiſe thoſe Things which are in their own Nature corruptible, had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been able from all Eternity, to have held out againſt thoſe forcible and violent Aſſaults, which in an infinite Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration muſt have happened.</q> I add, without the ſuperintend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of an Almighty Being.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If the World was eternal, <q>How comes it to paſs, <hi>ſays Lucretius,</hi> that the Poets ſpeak of nothing before the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan</hi> and <hi>Theban</hi> Wars?</q> Was there nothing memorable done in infinite Ages worthy to communicated to Poſterity, or could they find no Ways in that vaſt Space, to effect this till of late? How improbable are theſe Things? It is certain that divers profitable Inventions have been of late Years found out, ſuch as Printing, the Gun, the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Loadſtone, and divers other Particulars; what ſhould be the Reaſon that no Genius in infinite Ages ſhould luckily hit upon theſe before, if the World was Eternal? Had not Men the ſame Incitements to ſeek after ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions before as now? And to ſay that Men of late Ages have more Wit than a ſuppos'd infinite Number of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, is too great and groundleſs a Compliment upon the preſent Generation, and ſome few that have preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. But a</p>
            <p n="3">3d. Argument is this, The World is preſerved to this Day, therefore God exiſts: For what is the Conſervation of the World, but a continued Creation? with this Difference only, that the one includes a newneſs of exiſting, which the other excludes. If the Atheiſt ſhould deny that the World is preſerved, and ſay, that it endures only, as we ſay our God endures, without anothers Support: In anſwer to which we ſay, that it endures indeed but by Preſervation, and that becauſe it was produced by another, as has been before proved: And therefore the Difference between the Duration
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:005500_0096_1039673F48B249B0"/>
of God and the World is very vaſt; God is ſimply of himſelf, and therefore the Firſt, and ſo an independant Being, who needs not, and cannot receive Support from any other: Whereas the World is from another, and therefore muſt be preſerved by him to whom it owes its Original. The World muſt be either preſerved by it ſelf or by another; not by it ſelf, that which could not give to it ſelf a Being, cannot preſerve the Being it has received from another; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt be preſerved by another, and who can this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be, but he who gave it its Exiſtence? But if it was any other Thing that without doubt would be a Part of the World, and thus a Part would preſerve the whole which is abſurd!</p>
            <p>Surely that which preſerves a Part muſt needs preſerve the whole; moreover ſeeing there are in the World divers Parts which are not only of a different kind, but contrary to each other, ſuch as Fire and Water, &amp;c. which do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend againſt one another with all their Strength, what could keep them from deſtroying each other, but the Power of their Almighty Former? A</p>
            <p n="4">4th. Argument for the Exiſtence of a God may be drawn from the Government of the World. Here we preſuppoſe what no Atheiſt will deny, <hi>viz.</hi> that the World conſiſts of various Parts, not only different but contrary, and many of them irrational, which nevertheleſs harmoniouſly concur to promote their own particular Perfection, and the general Good of the whole Univerſe, and that without their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and contrary to their Nature, of Neceſſity therefore they muſt needs be governed, either by themſelves or another, not by themſelves, for many of them want Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and cannot be their own Guides, therefore it muſt be by another, and who is he that is fit for ſuch a ſpacious and important Province, but an omnipreſent, omnicient, omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:005500_0097_1039673D7A8E0938"/>
and infinitely wiſe Being? When we behold the various Wheels of a Watch mutually helping on one Deſign, by their contrary Motions which they know not, we preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude, that ſome Workman has been there, and has formed the Wheels and adjuſted them to their proper Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances, and by a Spring has put the Whole in Motion. If an Atheiſt ſhould ſay, that the former Order reſults from the peculiar Nature of the Parts, we may eaſily reply and ſay, but from whence is that Nature, Wiſdom and Order? When we behold the Harmony and Subſerviency of the ſeveral Parts of the Creation to each other, we may juſtly uſe the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>'s Exclamation, and ſay, <hi>How manifold are thy Works O God, in Wiſdom haſt thou made them all!</hi> The Sun enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens and warms the Earth, which elſe would be but a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy and barren Place. The pregnant Clouds ſhed their balmy Dews and gentle Drops, which prepare the Earth to produce its Fruits, which would be mar'd if the Water deſcended from the Clouds in Torrents, which it naturally tends to! And what leſs than Omnipotence, can ſupport thoſe vaſt Ciſterns of Water, I mean the Clouds, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Stronger Prop than the thin Air? Surely if they were left to their natural Gravity only, they would ſoon innundate the World with a ſecond Deluge! Dr. <hi>Bates</hi> obſerves reſpecting the Situation of the Sun,
<q>That if it was nearer the Earth it would ſcorch its Surface by too near an Approach, and if farther off, it would be oppreſſed by ſuch a multiplicity of cold moiſt Vapours as would obſtruct its Fruitfulneſs.</q> Its alſo obſervable, that the Sun by its exhaling Vertue, ſupplies from the Sea and moiſt Places of the Earth the empty Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of the viſible Heavens, that thus by this conſtant Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, the Earth being refreſhed, the Meads may laugh, the Fields be adorn'd with a grateful Verdure; and indeed the Winds are no leſs remarkable for their manifold Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:005500_0098_1039673B9ED2F5F0"/>
in carrying the ponderous Clouds to their Places, Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels to their Ports, and in refreſhing the Earth and the various Animals that live on its Surface, this ſerves as a Fan to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage the ſummers ſultry Heat!</p>
            <p>And does not the natural Inſtinct of acting in a different Manner, which we behold in various Animals, give further Light and Force to this Argument? <hi>e. g.</hi> The more fierce and formidable, ſuch as the Lyon, Bear, &amp;c. who could eaſily devour Men, fly from them, and inhabit Deſart Places of their own accord, while the more uſeful Animals ſuch as the Horſe, the Ox, &amp;c. being ignorant of their Strength to reſiſt, are tame and eaſily ſubmit themſelves to the Rule of weaker Men. With what ſurpriſing Sagacity does the Bird build her Neſt, the Spider frame its Web, the Bee form its numerous Repoſitories to receive and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Sweets which with much Diligence he extracts from the opening Flowers? With what prudent careful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, does the Ant lay up her Winter-Store before its approach? And likewiſe the Squirrels, and yet theſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures act without Reaſon or Deſign, muſt it not then neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily follow, that there is a divine Government.</p>
            <p>But methinks it ſtill illuſtrates this Argument, when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that the Wants of all Creatures are ſupply'd: Creatures can no more provide for themſelves than they could make themſelves, and who is equal to this Task, but an all ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient infinite Being? If there was no Providence, how could this be effected? And can there be a Providence without a God? Is it not owing to this all governing Providence, that the weakeſt Schemes are ſometimes crowned with Succeſs, and the beſt concerted prove abortive? <hi>Is not the Wiſdom of the Wiſe ſometimes deſtroyed, and the Underſtanding of the Prudent brought to nought? Surely the Race is not to the Swift, nor the Battle to the Strong! Surely Promotion comes neither
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:005500_0099_1039656E25C1C580"/>
from the Eaſt, nor from the Weſt, nor from the South; but God is the Judge, he putteth down one and ſetteth up another!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How amazing is the Conduct of Providence, in implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all Animals, rational and irrational, a natural Care for the Proviſion of their Young Ones, which even the moſt Savage ſort do ſurpriſingly manifeſt? and do they not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally bring forth their Young in the Spring? A Seaſon when they are moſt likely to be provided with Food for their Support! To what elſe than a divine Providence can we aſcribe the Proviſion of the Breaſt, the Udder with its Milk for their Suſtenation? with their natural Inſtinct with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Inſtruction, to ſeek Nouriſhment that Way? And it ſhould not be paſſed over with Silence and Negligence, that thoſe Things which are abſolutely neceſſary for the Support of Man's Life are common, and may be attained by the poorer Sort by Labour and Induſtry, while curious Dainties, fit for the Support of Luxury, are coſtly and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their Reach.</p>
            <p>Is it the Effect of Chance that ſome of the Beaſts of the Field have Weapons for their Defence? And that others have a natural Swiftneſs to fly from Danger, and that there be Caverns provided for their Security? Is it meer Chance that the Earth is ſtor'd with a variety of Medicines and Man endued with a Capacity to uſe them for his Cure?</p>
            <p>If the Sea, as ſome ſay, be higher than the Earth, what is it that puts Boundaries to its proud Surges and prevents a ſecond Inundation, but divine Providence? And what but this keeps the Elements about us, and Humours within us in a due Temperature? What but this that reſtrains the Wrath of our Enemies and preſerves us from Ruin? If Hurtful Inſects were not deſtoy'd by each other, or by the Cold Seaſon of the Year, would not they by their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers devour the Fruits of the Earth and deſtroy us? Now
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:005500_0100_1039656C7A6A1DE8"/>
what can we aſcribe this Prevention to, but a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendant Providence?</p>
            <p n="5">5. Another Argument for the divine Exiſtence may be drawn from the viſible Heavens, <hi>which do declare the Glory of God.</hi> With what inimitable Pomp and ſtately Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence does the azure Canopy ſparkle forth its various and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing Glories! The Motion of the Heavenly Luminaries is ſo regular and ſteady, that an Aſtronomer may tell for a Hundred Years to come their Eclipſes to a Minute! But from whence does this Order this Law proceed, but from ſome infinitely Wiſe and Almighty Legiſlator?</p>
            <p n="6">6. Another Argument may be deriv'd from both the Parts of the Compound Man. And</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. From the Body. How curious and beautiful is its Structure? Infinitely exceeding all Works of Art! Surely <hi>we are fearfully and wonderfully made!</hi> While the Brutal Herds have a prone and grovelling Aſpect, the Countenance of Man is erect, to contemplate the Heavens, where his Creator has his chief Seat of Reſidence! To ſignify as it were, where his chief delight ſhould be fixt, and that he ſhould as much exceed the lower Creation in the nobleneſs of his Sentiments and Affections, as he does in the natural form of his Aſpect! This the Poet expreſſes elegantly,
<q>
                  <l>Os homini Sublime dedit, celumq tueri,</l>
                  <l>Juſſit et erectos, ad Sydera tollere vultus.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The ſurpriſing variety of Features in the ſmall compaſs of the Face, where all the Parts are the ſame, manifeſts the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wiſdom of the Architect! Without this we cannot know each other: And thus all the ſocial Offices on which human Happineſs depends, muſt forever expire and termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate! The rudeſt Barbarities and Impieties muſt enſue, and Men degenerate into a Herd of Beaſts!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="98" facs="unknown:005500_0101_1039656ACC449830"/>How excellent are all the Parts of the human Body fitted, by their Form and Situation for Beauty, and all the Uſes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd by an intelligent Mind? The miſplacing of any Part, would make it as Monſtrous as Uſeles! <hi>Galen</hi> juſtly obſerved, <q>That if a Perſon ſtudied an hundred Years to place any Part of the human Body in a different Situation, that it could not be done without marring its Beauty and Service.</q> But there are ſome Parts of this Structure, which eſpecialy chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge our Admiration! The <hi>Brain</hi> in its mazy Labyrinths, which is the Seat of the Nerves and ſpring of Motion, who can enough admire or ſufficiently explain! The Eye with its various Coats, Humours and optick Nerve, by which our Sight is form'd. The Ear, with its Tymponum or Drum, on which the diſturbed Particles of Air vibrate and Cauſe a diverſity of Sounds. The quick and conſtant Circulation of the Blood by the Diaſtole and Syſtole of the Heart, through certain large Veins or openings and ſhuttings of it, Cauſes Pulſation and preſerves the natural Heat! When this grand Wheel is broken at the Ciſtern, the Stomack ceaſes to digeſt its Food, the whole Body grows cold and livid, and all the Offices of Nature fail. How different is that natural Heat which the Circulation of the Blood promotes from all others? Fire will gradually conſume itſelf, and all others which only have acquired Heat, will ſoon grow Cold; whereas the former is preſerved many Years without Waſting the Parts of the Body; and leaſt the Heart ſhould be over heated by its continual Motion, which would be prejudicial to the whole frame, to preſerve a due Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature, does not the Lungs ſerve as a Fan to cool and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frigerate it?</p>
            <p>And do not the Union of the Body with the Soul, a Being of a different Nature, deſerve our Wonder, and manifeſtly point to an infinitely Wiſe and Almighty Being as
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:005500_0102_103965690C746E48"/>
its Author? And thus I am led to ſpeak of the other Particular before mentioned, or the other Part of the compound Man, and indeed the moſt noble, viz. <hi>the Soul,</hi> whoſe excellent Powers and Capacities, if we do attentively ſurvey, we ſhall be obliged to conclude, <hi>that it is God that has formed the Spirit of Man within him.</hi> How raiſed and noble a Faculty is the <hi>Human Mind,</hi> which can form Ideas of Things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove its own Nature? It reflects on Things paſt, and this incites either our Pleaſure or Regret. It aims at the Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of Things to come, and thus it alarms our Fears or ſwells our Hopes! It beholds the Connection between Cauſes and their Effects, Premiſes and their Concluſion: It diſcerns the moral Beauty and excellency of Virtue and Religion!</p>
            <p>The Will, through the Aids of divine Grace, can chooſe what is Good and refuſe what is Evil. The Soul by its Reaſonings evidently appears to be an Immaterial, and therefore an immortal Subſtance; for it is impoſſible from the nature of Things, that meer Matter, however modified and put in Motion, can produce rational Reflections: And if ſo, then it muſt be formed by an All-wiſe and Almighty Being who is God.</p>
            <p>The Soul, by Reaſon of its ſpiritual and rational Nature, is capable of moral Government and Religion, it deſires after God and indeed can be only Happy in the Enjoyment of him. And the immenſe and boundleſs deſires of the Soul evidently argue the reality of a Supream Being: All the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of Senſe, in their greateſt Affluence and Variety, do not ſatisfy the cravings of our vaſt Deſires! We ſtill reach after a more immenſe and adequate Good! Then either there muſt be an infinite Being, in whoſe Embraces we may attain the compleat Happineſs we in vain ſeek elſewhere, or elſe Nature has done ſomething in vain, contrary to <hi>Ariſtotle's</hi> juſt Maxim: And thus the moſt noble Creature of this
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:005500_0103_103965676D099A20"/>
lower World would be made in its primitive Conſtitution more miſerable than the Brute-Creation, which is very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Another Argument to prove the Being of a God, may be the exact Accompliſhment of certain Propheſies concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing future contingent Events: This the Mind of Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perceive without the Aſſiſtance of Divine Revelation: It's true we may judge that neceſſary Cauſes will produce Effects according to their Nature, but reſpecting <hi>Arbitrary,</hi> we cannot determine. Now that ſeveral ſuch Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies have come to paſs, the Scriptures aſſert, which ought to paſs for a credible Hiſtory, till the Atheiſt proves the Contrary.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The Miraculous Works that have been wrought, prove the Being of a God; for who but he can give check to the courſe of Nature, and controul it's fixed Laws and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der? And that ſuch have been wrought is not only evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the Scriptures, but Prophane Writings. So that he muſt needs be a <hi>Sceptick,</hi> and deny all human Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that denies this Fact! But to proceed,</p>
            <p n="9">9. The Teſtimony of Conſcience proves the Being of a God. Are not Men ſometimes terrified with the Dread of Puniſhment, becauſe of thoſe Evils which no human Eye has ſeen them Commit, and which no human Law takes cognizance of? and theſe uneaſineſſes they are not able totally to extinguiſh by all the Arts of Diverſion they can invent! Neither can any worldly Grandeur exempt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, witneſs <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Caligula.</hi> And on the Contrary what a ſweet Calm poſſeſſes pious Boſooms in the Way of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? which make them fearleſs of evil Tidings! add to this, that the univerſal Conſent of all ages gives Teſtimony to the divine Exiſtence. <hi>Tully</hi> and divers others aſſert,
<q>That there is no Nation ſo barbarous but what has acknowledged a
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:005500_0104_10396565EA52BF50"/>
Deity. Some indeed were very groſs in their Idolatry, worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Leeks</hi> and <hi>Onions, as</hi> Juvenal <hi>in his</hi> Satyrs <hi>obſerves.</hi>
               </q> Now altho' thoſe unhappy Nations were miſerably miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken as to the Object of Worſhip, yet their unanimous concurrence in paying divine Adoration to ſomething, ſhews their acknowledgment of a Deity.</p>
            <p>If it be Objected, <hi>That Hiſtory informs us of ſome ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Atheiſts that have been, and of ſome Countries in</hi> Africa <hi>and</hi> America <hi>that have no religious Worſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Number of ſuch who have been recond <hi>ſpeculative Atheiſts</hi> has been very ſmall, beſides by the fear they have ſometimes diſcovered, they have plainly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, that they rather wiſhed there was no God, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved there was none; and ſuppoſing they did, it will not weaken the Argument: Becauſe ſome are born Fools will it follow that Reaſon is not natural to Man? As to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Particulars, the Facts are not ſufficiently atteſted, thoſe that have aſſerted them have not had familiarity enough with the Indians to know their Notions of a Deity: But ſuppoſing ſome ſhould ſo far degenerate into Brutes, as to lay aſide the Uſe of their Reaſon in this Point, it cannot conclude againſt the Majority who act rationally, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue from the Principles of Reaſon they are endowed with, the Exiſtence of a Deity!</p>
            <p>If it be objected, that God is not becauſe he is not ſeen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is ſordid: Then the Soul is not, becauſe it is not ſeen, and thus theſe Men are Brutes in their own Account.</p>
            <p>If it be again objected, <hi>That the Wicked are proſperous and the Righteous afflicted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> What then, is not God a Sovereign, may not he do what he will with his own? But if it be further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:005500_0105_10396563F519D770"/>
that outward Proſperity does not prevent inward Terror, and that good Men are made better by Afflictions, that divine Joy is conſiſtent with them, and that there will be a future Judgment, the Objection evaniſhes.</p>
            <p>But ſome do further Object, <hi>That the Notion of a God is a piece of State Policy, invented for the Benefit of Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, propagated by Tradition, and ſupported by Fear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> But who was the Man, or ſet of Men, that invented this, and when and where did they live? Or when was the World without all Belief of a Deity? Here the Atheiſt is nonpluſt! If the great Men of the Earth had invented the Notion of a God, is it reaſonable to ſuppoſe that they themſelves would be ſubject to the Terrors of it, as others have been? And if the Belief of a God was a human In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, how comes it to be ſo univerſally received, and that without the Methods of Force? And why was the Impoſture never diſcovered in ſo long a Tract of Time?</p>
            <p>It is likewiſe unreaſonable to ſuppoſe that the Belief of a Deity has been propagated only by Tradition, for it is bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed on the higheſt Reaſon, has univerſally obtained, and continued in all the Changes of Time and Revolutions of Nations; whereas Notions received with implicit Faith by Tradition, are not grounded on Reaſon; are not uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally received, but liable to change and mutation!</p>
            <p>It's likewiſe equally abſurd to ſuppoſe, that the Fear of Puniſhment ſhould give riſe to the Belief of a Deity: For why ſhould Men be afraid of Puniſhment for ſecret-Crimes, if there was no God to puniſh? Surely their Fear ſuppoſes a God, and is the Effect of this Perſwaſion. And how then can the Effect produce its Cauſe? Not to add that the primary Notion we have of God is, that <hi>he is a good and lovely Being.</hi> The fearful Apprehenſions of his Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance are but ſecondary and the Fruit of Guilt,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="unknown:005500_0106_1039656258812D98"/>What has been obſerved ſhews us the folly of <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> both <hi>Speculative</hi> and <hi>Practical!</hi> But this appears more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the inſtances following; how ridiculous is the <hi>Epicurian</hi> Account of the Original of the World, viz. <hi>That this beautiful Structure ſhould ſpring from the fortuitous Concourſe of Atoms in an immenſe Space!</hi> It is as likely, as <hi>Tully</hi> obſerves, <q>That all the Materials of a magnificent Edifice ſhould of their own accord meet and unite together.</q>
               <q>How long <hi>(ſays a learned Man)</hi> might a Perſon jumble a ſet of Letters together, or fling them on the Ground, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they would fall into an exact Poem; yea or ſo much as make a good Diſcourſe in Proſe?</q> The <hi>ſpeculative Atheiſt</hi> likewiſe ſhews his folly in requiring upon the one ſide, more evidence for Things than they are capable of! He aſks mathematical Demonſtration in moral and religious Matters, which can only be proved by moral Arguments and credible Teſtimony; their Nature admiting no other kind of Proof: But on the other ſide he labours to believe by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit Faith, againſt Reaſon and Argument, that the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of a God has been only propogated by Tradition, but cannot Account for his Notion.</p>
            <p>Again the Atheiſt's folly appears in this,
<q>That he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to know certainly what no Man can be certain of, viz. that there is no God. If he is not certain, how fooliſh is it to deny and deſpiſe ſuch a Being as God is! But how from the nature of Things can a Man be certain of a meer Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, unleſs it implies a Contradiction, which the Being of a God does not. To profeſs certainty here, is in other Words, to pretend to the Knowledge of all Things that are or can be; which is fooliſhly arrogant with a Witneſs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Further, there is this great Contradiction in the denial of a God, <hi>viz.</hi> He aſſerts that to be impoſſible which yet he muſt grant to be poſſible. For if there is no God already,
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:005500_0107_103965605B96CE20"/>
it's impoſſible now there ſhould be One, becauſe Eternity is eſſential to the Idea of a God. And yet the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> muſt grant it poſſible that there ſhould be ſuch a Being, who hath all poſſible Perfection, whom we call GOD.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Again, as <hi>Atheiſm</hi> deprives a Man of Happineſs in the next World, ſo it robs him of Comfort in this. For as it is inconteſtably evident,
<q>that Man cannot be his own Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he cannot ſatisfy his own Deſires or ward off the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils he is inviron'd with; ſo his principal Support amidſt the numerous Diſquietudes of Life, is Hopes of Protection and Happineſs from this Supream Being. This <hi>Atheiſm</hi> cuts entirely off, and ſo ſhuts up the chiefeſt Spring of Support and Sweetneſs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Once more, the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> ſhews his folly in contending a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the devout Man in this Inſtance, upon unequal grounds, for he ventures his everlaſting Intereſts; whereas the religious Man ventures only the loſs of his Luſt and ſome ſhort liv'd inconveniencies. He is better in all Reſpects without his Luſts, they are but a diſeaſe which mar the the true Comfort of Life; and as for other inconveniences, the Peace of his Mind and Expectation of future Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will enable him to comport with them comfortably, ſo that he is at leaſt upon a par with the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> as to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of this Life: And after Death he is as well of as the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> if there be no God, but if there be a God he is infinitely better of. If the Arguments for and againſt the Being of a God were equal, yet the Danger is ſo unequal that Prudence would incline us to chooſe the Affirmative, and make that the Meaſure of Life.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I need not Mention how deſtructive atheiſtical Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are to all the Intereſts of Society. They open the Flood-gates of Injuſtice and Prophaneneſs and incite Men to ſin without Controle! As there are many Evils preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:005500_0108_1039655ED45F5500"/>
to Society, which no human Laws can ſufficiently provide againſt. If the Reſtraints of Religion be removed, we lie open to a thouſand Wrongs and Inſults, eſpecially where the Tranſgreſſor has hopes of ſecreſy; and therefore while the Atheiſt ſuggeſts that the Belief of a God is a Trick of the State, he implicitly acknowledges, to the Honour of Religion, that it is neceſſary to the Government of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. And without Government, Reaſon will inform us, that the wildeſt Barbarities would be committed, and Scenes of Blood and Deſolation opened!</p>
            <p>But is not the <hi>practical Atheiſt</hi> ſtill a greater Fool than the <hi>Speculative,</hi> if poſſible, who pretends to believe a God and yet lives as if there was none! Such Perſons bid defiance to Reaſon and Conſcience in Matters of the greateſt Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. By their Lives they labour to confute their Faith, and ruſh into Damnation with their Eyes open!</p>
            <p>Let us therefore Brethren be intreated to labour to get a more full Perſuaſion and deep Senſe of the Exiſtence of a God upon our Minds, and of the Account which we muſt quickly render to him of our preſent Stewardſhip. To this End let us think on the Arguments that have been offered. Let us oppoſe the Temptations of Satan to the contrary. Let us behold theſe three great Leaves of the Volumn of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, viz. the <hi>Heavens, Earth</hi> and <hi>Sea</hi> with their Contents, and conſider, their immenſity and admirable Structure!</p>
            <p>Let us look into the ſacred Oracles, every Page of which proclaims a God, by reading of which <hi>Junius</hi> was convinced of his Atheiſm. Let us look up to God by Prayer. Let us carefully avoid whatſoever tends to Atheiſm. Among others, let us avoid theſe evil Principles, 1ſt. That a Man may be ſaved in his Religion be it what it will: This the Apoſtle ſpeaks againſt Eph. iv. 14, 15. <hi>That we be not henceforth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And as we ſhould avoid corrupt Principles, ſo likewiſe evil Practices, which tend to blind the Mind and harden the Heart and provoke the Almighty to give up Perſons to be deluded by the Devil: The Law of Sin, which is ſtrengthned by the Practice of it, inclines Perſons to hate the Law of God, and by Conſequence the Law-giver, and hence they are inclined to queſtion, diſpute and deny his Being, from all which may the good Lord deliver us all. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>And <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid unto God, behold, when I come unto the Children of Iſrael, and ſhall ſay unto them, the God of your Fathers hath ſent me unto you; and they ſhall ſay to me, what is his Name? What ſhall I ſay unto them?</p>
                  <p>And God ſaid unto <hi>Moſes, I AM THAT I AM:</hi> And he ſaid, thus ſhalt thou ſay unto the Children of Iſrael, <hi>I AM</hi> hath ſent me unto you.</p>

            <p>IN theſe Words, we have in Account of three Things, 1. <hi>Moſes</hi>'s undertaking an Embaſſy to <hi>Egypt: Behold when I come unto the Children of Iſrael, and ſhall ſay unto them, the God of Your Fathers hath ſent me unto you.</hi>
               <q>Tho' <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſenſible, of his unworthineſs of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of ſuch an Embaſſy, and of his inequality to the Task: He was well aware that he was not, <hi>Par negotio,</hi> yet being call'd of God, he ventures, and well he might, modeſt Beginnings are good Preſages.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly. We have an Account of a Difficulty that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtarts, namely this, <hi>and they ſhall ſay to me what is his Name?</hi> They will enquire, either from Unbelief to poſe me, they will be ſcrupulous, and apt to cavil, and bid me produce my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; or they will enquire out of carnal Curioſity, reſpecting the Divine Eſſence, for a Name that may repreſent it, or they will enquire for Information, doubtleſs they are grown ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:005500_0111_10396559E52EF778"/>
by their hard Bondage, want of Teachers, and loſs of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoths, and need to be told the firſt Principles of Religion. Now <hi>Moſes</hi> was anxious to know what he ſhould anſwer. All that undertake any important Task, ſhould conſider the Difficulties before Hand, and endeavour to get ſuitable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to manage in them. Thus did <hi>Moſes.</hi> But</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. We have an Account in our Text, of the Removal of this Difficulty; <hi>and God ſaid unto</hi> Moſes, I AM THAT I AM; and he ſaid, <hi>thus ſhalt thou ſay unto the Children of</hi> Iſrael, I AM <hi>hath ſent me unto you.</hi> This explains his Name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and ſignifies 1. That God is <hi>incomprehenſible.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by bold and curious Enquiry's after God's Being and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Name are cenſur'd. And in effect God ſayeth, <hi>ask not after my Name, ſeeing it is wonderful,</hi> Jud. xiii. Do we ask what is God? Let it ſuffice us to know, that he is what he is, what he ever was, and ever will be, <hi>That he is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and true to all his Promiſes, and not a Man that he ſhou'd lye.</hi> But 2. The aforeſaid Name ſignifies, that God is <hi>Self exiſting</hi> and <hi>independant,</hi> he has his Being of himſelf, and has no Dependance upon any other. This the beſt of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures cannot aſcribe to itſelf, for it is by Grace that it is, what it is. 3. God's <hi>Eternity</hi> is alſo hereby ſignified, for the Words may be thus tranſlated <hi>I ſhall be what</hi> I AM, and indeed God's Eternity follows neceſſarily from his <hi>Self-exiſtence.</hi> He that has borrow'd his Being from no other can never ceaſe to be; for what is able to deſtroy his <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence?</hi> And 4. The <hi>Immutability</hi> of God, is alſo ſignified by the aforeſaid Words, I AM, THAT I AM. I ſhall be what I am; I ſhall be, what I ſhall be, or I am what I ſhall be. <hi>God is the ſame Yeſterday to Day and for ever.</hi> In diſcourſing upon this Subject, I ſhall firſt ſpeak of the <hi>Names</hi> of God, And,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="109" facs="unknown:005500_0112_1039655835120388"/>II. Of the particular <hi>Attributes,</hi> which are ſignified by that Name aſſumed by the Almighty in our Text. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. I am to conſider the <hi>Names of God.</hi> It is by the <hi>Names</hi> and Attributes of God, that we come to an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Knowledge of his Eſſence or Being, indeed the Deſign of Names, is to give us ſome Idea of the Things they are impos'd upon, they declare their Natures and peculiar Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty's, whereby they differ from others, which may be more juſtly apply'd to the Names of God than to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe they have been devis'd not by ignorant Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but by an infinitely wiſe God, who only knows himſelf perfectly.</p>
            <p>It is true, the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of God being <hi>incomprehenſible,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be fully repreſented by any Name, and hence is <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s Query, <hi>Prov.</hi> xxx. 4. <hi>What is his Name, and what is his Sons Name if thou canſt tell?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And inaſmuch as God is a moſt ſingular Being, by his Nature moſt diſtinct from all others; therefore he needs not an <hi>appelative Name,</hi> whereby Species in the ſame Kind are diſtinguiſhed; or a <hi>Proper Name,</hi> by which individuals of the ſame Species are diſtinguiſhed. Nevertheleſs in Love and Condeſcention to our Weakneſs, he is pleas'd to aſcribe Names to himſelf, that ſo we may be the better enabled to diſtinguiſh him from Creatures and falſe Gods, and attain clearer Notions of his Being and Perfections.</p>
            <p>Now the Name of God in Scripture, Sometimes ſignifies 1. Himſelf, (<hi>Pſ.</hi> v. 11.) 2. ſometimes all that reſpects God, <hi>e. g.</hi> his <hi>Attributes, (Ex.</hi> xv. 3.) his <hi>Commands, (Deut.</hi> xviii. 19.) his <hi>Worſhip, (Act.</hi> xxi. 13.) yea <hi>CHRIST himſelf,</hi> who does not only carry the Name of God in him, <hi>but brings us to the Knowledge of God the Father, (Ex.</hi> xxiii. 19. <hi>John</hi> v. 24.) but 3. It more properly denotes thoſe Words, by which the Eſſence of God, or ſomething like it is repreſented.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="unknown:005500_0113_10396556B1364828"/>Farther the Names of God, are either <hi>Eſſential</hi> or <hi>Perſonal.</hi> The Eſſential are ſuch as theſe, <hi>Jehovah, Theos:</hi> The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal <hi>Elohim, Father, Son, Spirit.</hi> Again the eſſential Names of God are either <hi>proper</hi> or <hi>figurative;</hi> the latter are aſcrib'd to God, either <hi>metonimically,</hi> thus he is ſaid to be our <hi>Help, Light, Strength,</hi> or <hi>metaphorically,</hi> when he is call'd our <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Shield.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The only proper and <hi>incommunicable</hi> Name of God is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> by this he will be known to all Generations, and the Glory of this, he will not give to any Creature, the Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which has been before explain'd, in ſpeaking upon the Words I AM.</p>
            <p>The Name <hi>Elohim</hi> is plural, from which ſome argue a Trinity of Perſons in the Godhead.
<q>Some think it is compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Words, that ſignify Strong, and has ſwore becauſe God having made Men by his Strength, binds them to his Worſhip as it were by an Oath.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The moſt uſual Name of God, in the New Teſtament is <hi>Theos,</hi> which is ſaid to refer to <hi>Elohim</hi> 
               <q>in the Old, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs its Meaning.</q> This Word is deriv'd of Verbs, which ſignify to <hi>behold</hi> and <hi>diſpoſe,</hi> becauſe God <hi>beholds</hi> and <hi>diſpoſes</hi> of all Things according to his own good Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Here it may be obſerv'd, that all the Names of God, beſides <hi>Jehovah,</hi> tho' in ſtrict propriety, they belong to the Almighty only, yet improperly, and by way of Analogy or Reſemblance, they are aſcrib'd to Creatures.</p>
            <p>What has been ſaid upon this Head may excite us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of prophaning the Names of God either in our <hi>Hearts</hi> by <hi>Ignorance,</hi> or <hi>Forgetfulneſs,</hi> or by our <hi>Lips</hi> by a <hi>raſh</hi> and <hi>irreverent uſe of them,</hi> or by our <hi>Lives</hi> thro' <hi>impiety.</hi> The great God, has ſaid, <hi>that he will not hold them guiltleſs that take his Name in vain! Thoſe that name the Name of God, ought to depart from all Iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="unknown:005500_0114_10396554C4288788"/>On the contrary, we ſhould declare and profeſs God's Name call, upon it, fear and reverence it, and confide in it. <hi>Acts</hi> ix. 14. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 19. <hi>Joel</hi> ii. 32. <hi>Pro.</hi> xviii. 10. <hi>The Name of the Lord is a ſtrong Tower, the Righteous run to it and are ſafe!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I proceed to the 2d. general Head, which was to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, upon thoſe particular Attributes of God, which are ſignify'd by the Name I AM or <hi>Jehovah.</hi> Here more general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it may be obſerv'd, that the Attributes of God are ſo call'd, becauſe we aſcribe them to him! <hi>They are the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Property's of God, by which we attain ſome Knowledge of his Being:</hi> or in other Words, <hi>they are that one infinite Perfection of God, which thro' the Weakneſs and Finiteneſs of our Underſtandings, we conceive by various Acts, as it were by Parts,</hi> juſt as when we would ſee the whole Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon, which is but one, we uſe various Acts of ſeeing, looking to the Eaſt, Weſt, North, South, until we ſee the whole! All the divine Attributes are in God, but <hi>one pure</hi> and <hi>ſimple Act.</hi> It is impoſſible that that Being, who is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely the firſt, ſhould be compos'd of different Things for this would ſuppoſe a Compoſer prior to the Firſt, which is impoſſible! Neither can an infinite Being conſiſt of different Things: For theſe Things muſt be either infinite or finite. Many infinites imply a Contradiction, neither can many finite Cauſes produce an infinite Effect: Neither can an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable and incorruptible Being conſiſt of different Things, for where one Thing is compounded with another it may be ſeparated from it, and thus Change and Corruption would enſue!</p>
            <p>Some Divines do diſtinguiſh the Attributes of God, into thoſe that are <hi>communicable</hi> &amp; <hi>incommunicable.</hi> The <hi>communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Attributes</hi> of <hi>God are ſuch as we find ſome Shadow of in intelligent Beings;</hi> of this Kind, are his <hi>Holineſs, Juſtice,
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:005500_0115_10396553240C9F58"/>
Goodneſs, Truth.</hi> We find ſomething like theſe in Creatures, tho' with vaſt Diſproportion! in God they are infinitely, but in Creatures in a limited and finite Manner.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>incommunicable Attributes of God,</hi> are ſuch <hi>as we find no Shadow of in Creatures.</hi> Of this Kind are his <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency, Eternity, Immutability</hi> and <hi>Incomprehenſibility.</hi> Theſe ſhew how infinitely diſtant God is from all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in reſpect of Dignity and Excellency, and how he is oppos'd to every Imperfection in them.</p>
            <p>Now to aſſiſt our Conception of the divine Attributes, theſe Things following may be obſerv'd.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That ſeeing all the Attributes of God conſtitute but one ſimple Act, as has been before obſerv'd, therefore no Degrees of Inequality are to be admitted among them, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,</hi> and on God's Part, all and ſingular of them import infinite Perfection, which admits not of more or leſs, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it may be, that <hi>outwardly</hi> one Attribute may extend itſelf to more Objects than another, in which Senſe the Underſtanding may be ſaid to be greater than the Will. Or it may act with more Intenſeneſs upon one Object than another, in which Senſe God loves the Elect more than the Reprobate. And,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Much leſs can any Contrariety be admitted among them, if any ſuch Thing ſeems to appear between Mercy and vindicative Juſtice, this is altogether in the Object, about which the uniform Perfection of God, becauſe of its own Infinity, is occupied various Ways, or it is to be aſcrib'd to our different Ways of conceiving of the divine Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And,</p>
            <p n="3">3. When we think upon the Divine Attributes we muſt remove far from them, all that Imperfection, which cleaves to ſuch like Properties in Creatures, and conceive that the remaining Perfection is attended with the higheſt Eminence in God.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="113" facs="unknown:005500_0116_103965518411EE60"/>4. All the divine Attributes do truly belong to God, he is not only in reſpect of our Thought, but in Regard of the Condition of his own Nature, wiſe, good, juſt. And they belong to him not in the <hi>concrete</hi> only as they do to Creatures, but in the <hi>Abſtract.</hi> He is not only wiſe, juſt, good, but <hi>Wiſdom, Juſtice, Goodneſs.</hi> In Creatures they are ſecondarily, by way of Quality ſuperaded to their Being, but in him they are primarily without De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivation, and therefore his very Being it ſelf. But here, before I proceed to a more particular Conſideration of the divine Attributes, I ſhall offer a Word of Improvement, from what has been ſaid.</p>
            <p>Methinks the general Theory of divine Perfections ſerves to ſtrengthen our Faith exceedingly, in reſpect of the Trinity: Seeing that the incommunicable Attributes of God which coinceede with the divine Eſſence, are not only aſcrib'd to the Father, but to the Son and Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>And with what Firmneſs and Freedom may we truſt in God, and approach to his Throne of Grace ſeeing there is ſuch a Concourſe of Perfections in him, <hi>viz.</hi> of Wiſdom, Power, Goodneſs, &amp;c. of which every one is infinite, eternal, and immutable!</p>
            <p>What powerful Incitements do the divine Attributes Miniſter to our Praiſe, Reverence, and Obedience, of and to the Sacred Trinity? And how happy is that People who have ſuch a great and glorious God for their Portion and Inheritance? Well might the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſay, <hi>Bleſſed is that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whoſe God is the Lord, Pſal.</hi> xxxiii. 12. When God is ours then all his Attributes are ours, and engaged to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote our Benefit (<hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 31.) And his immutability aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us, that he will remain ours to all Eternity, (<hi>Mal.</hi> iii. 6.) His Truth is inviolable, and therefore we may with unſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Confidence, reſt on his Promiſes, which cannot fail!
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:005500_0117_1039654FAB7D8798"/>
His Love and Goodneſs may calm us in all Adverſity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they will cauſe it to iſſue in our Benefit. His Wiſdom and Power enable him to do for us all that we need, and his Mercy inclines him to forgive our Sins, and to exert the other Attributes of his Nature in our Behalf.</p>
            <p>But I proceed to a more particular Conſideration, of theſe Attributes of God which are ſignified by the Name I AM, the firſt of which is his <hi>Incomprehenſibility.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Eſſence of God as it is in itſelf, is inacceſſible to our Underſtandings. The Iſraelites enquire of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> of God, Concerning a Name which might repreſent his <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,</hi> and while the Almighty anſwers, I AM THAT I AM, reproving the Folly of the Queſtion, what does it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify, but that his Eſſence is <hi>incomprehenſible,</hi> and therefore <hi>inexpreſſible!</hi> The ſame Thing which <hi>Zophar</hi> teaches his Friend, in plainer Terms. <hi>Job.</hi> xi. 7, 8, 9. <hi>Canſt thou by ſearching find out God? Canſt thou find out the Almighty unto Perfection? It is as high as Heaven, what canſt thou do? Deeper than Hell, what canſt thou know? The Meaſure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is longer than the Earth, and broader than the Sea!</hi> And hence he is ſaid <hi>to dwell in Light inacceſſible, which no Mortal Eye hath ſeen nor can ſee.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> vi. 16. neither with the Eyes of the Body, or of the Mind; and hence he is call'd <hi>the inviſible God,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> i. 17. Therefore the Almighty deny'd to <hi>Moſes</hi> a Sight of his Face, while in the mean Time he ſhew'd him his back Parts. By all our Contemplations we rather know what the Eſſence of God is not than what it is. Now the Reaſons of the Point under our preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, are theſe following, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The Being of God is infinite and therefore cannot be comprehended by a finite Mind. 2. The Divine Eſſence is a moſt pure and ſimple Act, void of all Compoſition, and therefore cannot be po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively conceiv'd of; and hence the Apoſtle calls <hi>Jehovah,</hi>
               <pb n="115" facs="unknown:005500_0118_1039654E299E3C60"/>
not a Subſtance ſhining in the Concrete, but Light in the Abſtract; and therefore he is not, nor cannot be ſeen. 3. The Being of God is moſt ſimply one, by which it is ſo different from all Creatures, that it agrees with them in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and therefore no Idea of the divine Eſſence can be borrow'd from them. And how then can a proper Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof be formed by us.</p>
            <p>But it may be objected againſt what has been ſaid under this Head, that the Scriptures informs us, that God has been ſeen by many of the Saints, particularly by <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob, Moſes, Iſaiah,</hi> and others, <hi>Job</hi> was perſuaded that with <hi>the ſame Eyes he ſhould ſee God,</hi> and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> informs us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xiii. 12. that <hi>here we ſee darkly, but then,</hi> meaning in Heaven, <hi>we ſhall ſee Face to Face.</hi> The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid Places are to be underſtood either of a ſymbolical Viſion, not of the Eſſence, but of the Operations of God, under certain Signs, or of the more perfect Knowledge of God, which will be attain'd in the Paradiſe of God; which in its Perfection ſhall imitate Sight or Knowledge by it, yea exceed it; but they do not infer the Viſion of his Eſſence.</p>
            <p>But that the Meaning of what has been offer'd, may be the better underſtood; it is to be obſerved that our Diſcourſe is not concerning God, but the Eſſence of God as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd diſtinct from his Attributes, or as it is conceived, as ſomething ſubſtracted or as the firſt Being, which the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes perfect. And 2. our Diſcourſe is not concerning the Eſſence of God that it is, for that is many Ways evident; but what it is in itſelf, and not in the Attributes. This our Minds can have no apprehenſive or comprehenſive Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of, for the Reaſons before mentioned. And indeed in this Reſpect we cannot know the Eſſence of Angels, or of our own Souls?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="unknown:005500_0119_1039654C89B411E0"/>Is the Divine Eſſence incomprehenſiible, then 1. this ſhould repreſs carnal Curioſity which appears in Enquiries about Things too high for us, and inacceſſible to us, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Things we need not to know for Oſtentations ſake, or ſome other mean End, or in bold Sayings about what we underſtand not; as for Example, when Perſons ſay that the Divine Eſſence is but a Thought as the <hi>Carteſians, ſuch are wiſe above what is written,</hi> 1. This vain Curioſity is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by God himſelf, <hi>Ex.</hi> iii. 4, 5. <hi>God call'd unto</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <hi>and ſaid, draw not nigh hither.</hi> Ex. xix. 21. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto</hi> Moſes <hi>go down charge the People, leſt they break thro' unto the Lord to gaze, and many of them periſh.</hi> 2.

            </p>
            <p>But I proceed to conſider the 2. Attribute of God, which is ſignified by the Words I AM, <hi>viz.</hi> his Self-Exiſtence or Independancy. The Almighty by thoſe Words, informs <hi>Moſes</hi> that he was abſolutely in and of himſelf, not <hi>poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> as tho' he had produced himſelf, but <hi>negatively,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Being and Perfections were deriv'd of no other; or in other Words, the Almighty by the aforeſaid Expreſſion declares himſelf, to be abſolutely the firſt Being, and intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:005500_0121_103965491062FDF8"/>
independent of any other prior Cauſe, either <hi>Efficient</hi> by whom he ſhould be; or <hi>material</hi> of whom he ſhould be, or <hi>formal</hi> by whom he ſhould be, what he is; or <hi>final</hi> to whom as an End he ſhould be directed. All Creatures live and move, and have their Beings in and from God, but it is his peculiar Glory, to derive his Being from none.</p>
            <p>From the Firſtneſs, Aſeity, Self-Exiſtence, and Independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Divine Eſſence or Being, naturally and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily follows, the Independance of all his Attributes <hi>e.g.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. His Goodneſs is independant, he vouchſafes Benefits up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom, and when he pleaſes, his meer Sovereignty alone determines not only the Objects and Time of conferring his Kindneſſes, but alſo the <hi>Kind, Meaſure</hi> &amp; <hi>Duration</hi> of them. <hi>He hath Mercy upon whom he will have Mercy,</hi> nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out himſelf can influence, far leſs conſtrain him: For this would argue Imperfection and Dependance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His Holineſs is independent, he hates Sin, not for any Reaſons without himſelf, but becauſe of the eternal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety of his Nature thereto.</p>
            <p n="3">3. His Power is likewiſe independent, as he has deriv'd it from none, ſo he depends upon none in the Exerciſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And therefore cannot be control'd by Creatures in his providential Proceedings. <hi>He does what he pleaſes in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Heaven, and among the Inhabitants of the Earth, and who can ſtay his Hand, or ſay to him what doeſt thou?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The Wiſdom of God is independent, his Wiſdom is not in him, as a Quality added to his Being, as it is in Creatures, but it is himſelf, he receives not his Ideas from Objects without himſelf, as Creatures do, in which reſpect they are dependant on them; but the Knowledge of God was infinite, before any Creature had a Being. Hence the Royal Prophet enquires with Beauty and Emphaſis? <hi>Who hath directed the Spirit of the Lord, with whom took he Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:005500_0122_1039654769BECC50"/>
and who inſtructed him in the Path of Judgment?</hi> Iſa. xl. 13, 14.</p>
            <p>The Scriptures give Teſtimony to the Self-Exiſtence and Independency of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> i. 8. <hi>I am the Alpha &amp; Omega, the Beginning and the Ending ſaith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.</hi> The ſame is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated in the Book of the <hi>Revelations</hi> frequently. And Reaſon alſo confirms the aforeſaid Truth. Seeing it is abſurd to ſuppoſe, that any Thing ſhould be the Cauſe of itſelf, for then it muſt be and not be at the ſame Time; and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that an infinite Succeſſion of Cauſes is impoſſible, for then the next Cauſe which produceth the Effect, would not ſubſiſt, becauſe there is no End to Infinity: There muſt of neceſſity be ſome firſt ſelf-exiſting Being, which we call God. Now from this Firſtneſs or Self-Exiſtence of God; proceed his Unity, Immutability, Infinity and Simplicity. And 1. his <hi>Unity.</hi> What is abſolutely the firſt Being, muſt needs be one; for if more ſuch be imagin'd, neither will be abſolutely the firſt, becauſe it does not preceed the other. 2. <hi>Immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility;</hi> If he is changed, he is changed by another, and that other muſt be before him, but what can be before him that is abſolutely the Firſt? 3. His <hi>Infinity.</hi> Whatſoever is limitted, is limitted by another, for nothing can limit itſelf, and its own Perfection, &amp; that other muſt be before it, but what can be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him who is abſolutely the firſt? 4. His <hi>Simplicity.</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is compos'd, is compos'd by one prior to itſelf; but what can be before the Firſt? Again the <hi>Independance</hi> of God, appears evidently from his producing all Things by his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Such Things as he has made muſt needs depend upon his Power and Pleaſure for their Being and Support, now if they depend on him, how can it be that he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on them? To ſuppoſe the Cauſe and Effect to be mutually dependant on each other, is to ſuppoſe they are mutually deriv'd from each other, which is impoſſible!
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:005500_0123_10396545E7851890"/>
Once more, if God be infinitely above the nobleſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, then he cannot depend on them, for dependance argues inferiority. Now that God is above all created Beings, is moſt manifeſt. <hi>The Nations are but as the Drop of a Bucket, as the ſmall Duſt of the Balance, yea as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing and leſs then nothing and Vanity,</hi> as the Royal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet obſerves, with noble Pomp of Diction. Is God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent, then 1ſt. Hence we may learn the <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Folly</hi> of aſcribing this divine Attribute to dependant Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures! On the Contrary let us conclude that all our Springs are in God, from him all our Bleſſings flow; he is the only Source of our Happineſs, the Foundation of our Hope, the Author and finiſher of our Faith. And</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. Our inability to lay the Almighty under any Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation by our Services, ſeeing he is <hi>independent,</hi> and ſo compleatly Happy in himſelf, <hi>who hath firſt given to him,</hi> ſayeth the Apoſtle <hi>Paul and it ſhall be recompenſed to him</hi> again! for of him and thro' him and to him are all Things. Our Goodneſs extends not to him, ſays the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> can a Man be profitable unto God, ſaith <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> as he that is Wiſe may be profitable to himſelf, or is it any gain to him that thou makeſt thy Ways perfect? <hi>Joh</hi> xxii. 23.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, We may hence learn the Sinfullneſs and Danger of oppoſing God's Sovereignty, either 1ſt. Openly by wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it aboliſh'd, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. 1, <hi>and</hi> 10, 4.) Or 2dly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretatively, when Men in the Buſineſs of Predeſtination, believe that the Grace of God is ſuſpended upon foreſeen Faith and Good Works. Such Perſons do deprive God of his abſolute Sovereignty, and aſcribe an Independance to the Creatures Will; and thus they jumble Heaven and Earth together. Or 3dly practically in the following Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, 1ſt. When Perſons limit God, <hi>Pſa,</hi> lxxviii 41.

<pb n="121" facs="unknown:005500_0124_1039654464C2FAF0"/>
or in a greater or leſſer Degree diſtruſt his Word and Power. <hi>Numb.</hi> xi. 21, 23. And 2dly, When Perſons by Diſobedience diſpute the divine Dominion, and ſtruggle with him for Independency, after the example of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roh, (<hi>Exo.</hi> v. 2.) and other ungodly Perſons. (<hi>Job.</hi> xxi. 14.) And 3dly, when Men will not acquieſs in the Decrees and Providences of God, but murmur againſt him, (<hi>Rom.</hi> ix. 20.) All thoſe Sorts of Perſons, I have now mention'd do endeavour tho' in different Degrees and Modes, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Eſſence of God, which conſiſts in abſolute Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance, and therefore are Atheiſts, or at leaſt partake in an awful degree of Atheiſm. All ſuch ſhall find God to be ſuch, as they would not have him to be, except they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent he ſhall be to them a ſevere Judge, a conſuming Fire, as a Bear bereav'd of her Whelps. They ſhall find him to be ſuch as <hi>Pharoh,</hi> the Atheiſt of old, found him. Jer. 16. ult. <hi>Therefore, behold, I will this once cauſe them to know, I will cauſe them to know mine Hand and my might, and they ſhall know that my Name is the Lord.</hi> But,</p>
            <p n="4">4thly, From hence we may learn the comfortable State of thoſe who have a covenant Intereſt in God. Amidſt all the Difficulties of this Preſent Life, do they want the <hi>Goods</hi> of <hi>Fortune,</hi> Honour, Wealth, Relations? Are they co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with Reproach, and counted the ofſcourings of the World? Do they want the neceſſary ſupports of Life, and are their dear Relations Dead? Do they want the <hi>Goods of the Body,</hi> Health, Peace, Liberty? Are are plaug'd with E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, Perſecutors, and taſk Maſters? Do they want the <hi>Goods of the Mind,</hi> viz. neceſſary Wiſdom, ſpiritual Light, and Comfort? And do their Enemies ſometimes lead them Captive? What can in ſuch Caſes and in all others of the like Nature, more effectually ſupport and comfort us, then to think, 1ſt, That God is. By which Argument the
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:005500_0125_1039654239498AE8"/>
Almighty comforted the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in our Text. And <hi>Aſaph</hi> himſelf, <hi>Pſa.</hi> lxxiii. 25.26. <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but hee? and there is none upon Earth that I deſire beſides thee. My Fleſh and my Heart faileth: But God is the Strength of my Heart and my Portion for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And 2dly, That God is eminently all being, he is omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and perfectly knows our wants, he is omnipotent, and can eaſily ſupply them, in his Hand is Power and Might. He is infinitely Gracious and Merciful, and ſo will not finally forſake his poor People, but is inclin'd to relieve them. He is All-ſufficient, poſſeſſing every Thing that ſerves to ſupply his Peoples Neceſſitys, and remove their Miſeries! He is <hi>a Sun and Shield, a hiding Place from the Wind,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And 3dly. That God is not only to himſelf, but to us All in All, the Author of our Beings and Fountain of every of our Bleſſings!</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. That he is a <hi>Self-Exiſting,</hi> and by conſequence an <hi>Independent</hi> and <hi>Eternal</hi> God! whoſe Help does not depend on Creatures or Inſtruments, and whoſe Love will never change in any viciſitude of Circumſtance, or Succeſſion of Duration. I AM THAT I AM, I ſhall be THAT I AM. From the aforeſaid Conſiderations ſpring ſweet Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and Solace in every immergent, in caſe we do but cloſe heartily with God in Covenant, by which he may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our God. <hi>Jer.</hi> xxxi. 33.</p>
            <p>But in the laſt Place. By what has been before obſerv'd, we ſhould be exhorted to perform the following Duties 1ſt, We ſhould put our Truſt in God, and him alone, ſeeing that he is that one I AM, by his Eſſence, who by his ſovereign and almighty Beck, can command Light to ſpring out of Darkneſs, Order out of Confuſion, and call the Things that are not as tho' they were! <hi>Curſed is the Man that truſteth in Man or maketh Fleſh his Arm, whoſe
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:005500_0126_103965409CE76230"/>
Breath is in his Noſtrils, who is cruſhed before the Moth, who changeth with the Wind, and is lighter than Vanity!</hi> The great I AM is only worthy of our entire Confidence, his <hi>Immenſity</hi> and <hi>Almightineſs</hi> are only <hi>equal</hi> to our vaſt <hi>Deſires:</hi> His <hi>Independent Excellency</hi> is only worthy of our <hi>ſupream Love;</hi> and his <hi>Eternity</hi> is only parallel to our <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Duration.</hi> He, he, will never fail the believing Expectation of his People! 2dly. Let us deny our Wiſdom, Will and Power, and ſay with our dear Lord, <hi>thy Will be done and not mine:</hi> Being always mindful that God only is <hi>independent and</hi> the <hi>firſt mover</hi> of all. 3dly. Let us <hi>humble our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi> before the great I AM, whoſe Prerogative it is alone to be abſolutely; in Compariſon of whom we poor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Worms are not, are nothing, and leſs than nothing, <hi>as a drop of the Bucket compared with the vaſt Ocean, and as a little Duſt in the Balance compar'd with the whole Globe of the Earth!</hi> 4. We ſhould <hi>receive the Word of God, and Miniſters</hi> of it, with due Reverence and Reſpect. For this End <hi>Moſes,</hi> in our Text, was furniſhed with Credentials, <hi>go to the People of</hi> Iſrael <hi>and tell them, that</hi> I AM <hi>hath ſent me unto you.</hi> Thoſe that deſpiſe the <hi>faithful Miniſters</hi> of CHRIST, deſpiſe thro' them their Maſter, and muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to meet with their Reward in this or the next Life, except they Repent! No Employment on Earth is attended with more Difficulty, and yet more poorly Rewarded in this Life, than the Miniſterial Office! Many think their Tongues are their own, and that they may ſcourge them with falſe Invectives as they liſt; and many, who ſeem to make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of their other Debts, think they are at Liberty to wrong them and rob them of their promis'd Maintainace, and act accordingly. But</p>
            <p n="5">5thly, and finally. Let us be excited to glorify God on Account of his <hi>Independency,</hi> in Heart, Lip and Life. Let
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:005500_0127_1039653EFAEFFF58"/>
us bow before the Sovereign God, and ſubmit ourſelves to his equitable Government and unerring Diſpoſals, with the greateſt Readineſs and humbleſt Reverence! Let us extol <hi>Jehovah</hi> the abſolute Lord of the whole Univerſe, with chearful Acclamations, inceſſant and harmonious <hi>Hoſanna</hi>'s on the Account of this very venerable Jewel of his Crown! In this Way we may expect to be owned by the <hi>Independent</hi> Sovereign of Heaven and Earth here, and accepted by him hereafter at the grand and important Advent of the Son of God, when univerſal Nature diſſolving in Agony and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, ſhall open the moſt amazing and tremendous Scene!</p>

                  <p>And God ſaid unto <hi>Moſes, I AM THAT I AM:</hi> And he ſaid, thus ſhalt thou ſay unto the Children of Iſrael, <hi>I AM</hi> hath ſent me unto you.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN Diſcourſing on this Text you may remember, that in the preceeding Sermon after an Explication of it and more general Obſervations upon the divine Attributes, I proceeded to ſpeak upon two particulars, namely, the <hi>Incomprehenſibility</hi> and <hi>Independency of God,</hi> which I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended were included in it. And moreover made mention of two others, which I am now to diſcourſe upon, viz. the <hi>Eternity</hi> and <hi>Immutability of God.</hi> In ſpeaking upon the <hi>Eternity of God,</hi> I ſhall endeavour to explain, confirm and Improve this great Truth. And</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. The Word <hi>Eternity</hi> ſometimes ſignifies, a long ſpace of Time that hath both a <hi>Beginning</hi> and <hi>End.</hi> Thus he that ſerv'd to the Year of Jubilee, is ſaid <hi>to ſerve for ever, Ex.</hi> xxi. 6. And ſo the Ceremonial Laws are ſaid <hi>to be forever, Num.</hi> x. 8. 2dly. Sometimes it ſignifies a <hi>Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which has a Beginning but no End. Thus it is with the Angels and our own Souls. And 3dly. Sometimes it ſignifies a <hi>Duration</hi> without Beginning or End, which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to God only, and diſtinguiſhed from the other Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:005500_0129_1039653BC9A256D0"/>
by redoubling of the Words thus, <hi>forever and ever,</hi> from <hi>everlaſting to everlaſting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Various Deſcriptions are given by different Divines of Eternity.
<q>That is properly Eternal (<hi>ſays</hi> Petavius) which never had a Beginning nor never can ceaſe to be.</q>
               <q>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity (<hi>ſay</hi> Drexilius, Barlow, and Prideaux) is an ever preſent <hi>Duration,</hi> it is one perpetual Day, which paſſes not into what is paſt or future.</q>
               <q>That is Eternal (<hi>ſays</hi> Zanchy) which wanting Beginning and Ending is ſtill the ſame.</q>
               <q>Eternity (<hi>ſays</hi> Boetius) is a full and perfect Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of interminable or everlaſting Life together and at once.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But the moſt eaſy and intelligible Deſcription thereof is this, viz. <hi>that it is an imcommunicable Perfection or Property of the Deity, whereby his Duration is without Beginning, Succeſſion and End.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And 1ſt. That the <hi>Duration</hi> of the Almighty was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Beginning,</hi> is evident both from Scripture and Reaſon, Deut. xxxiii. 27. <hi>The eternal God is thy Refuge, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath are the everlaſting Arms!</hi> Pſal. xciii. 2. <hi>Thy Throne is eſtabliſhed of Old, thou art from Everlaſting.</hi> And hence the People of God are ſaid <hi>to be choſen before the Foundation of the World.</hi> And Reaſon alſo confirms the ſame Truth, as follows, 1ſt. If God created all Things in the Beginning of Time, than he himſelf was before it, and ſo by conſequence from Eternity. Time being in its Nature a ſucceſſive Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, taking its riſe from a certain Point or Moment, which is termed a <hi>Beginning:</hi> The Duration which was before it muſt be Eternal, unleſs we ſuppoſe Time to begin before it did begin, which is a Contradiction. But God did create all Things in the Beginning, as both Scripture and Reaſon aſſure us, Ergo.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. The Eternity of God may be inferr'd from the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his Nature. His Duration is Perfect, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:005500_0130_10396539F0D05298"/>
Infinite; for to begin to exiſt is an Imperfection, on which Account Creatures are ſaid <hi>to be but of Yeſterday,</hi> which is a diminutive Character. If God was not from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, what he is, he would not be God, becauſe God is a moſt perfect Being, <hi>i. e.</hi> who has all Perfection which is or can be: Now that which is deſtitute of Exiſtence, is deſtitute of all that Perfection which is in Exiſtence; yea he would be diſtitute of Eſſence alſo, for Eſſence and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence are in God one and the ſame.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. If God was not from Eternity then Nothing would exiſt. For if the Firſt does not exiſt, a Second or a Third cannot, as appears from the Subordination of Cauſes.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. If God was not from Eternity, there was a Time when he was not, and than he would not be now. For either he muſt produce himſelf before he was, and ſo be and not be at the ſame Time, or be produc'd by another, who by Conſequence muſt be before the Firſt; both which are equally abſurd: For it is eſſential to God to be abſolutely the firſt Being and Self-exiſtent.</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. Seeing that the Almighty gave Being to all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which is imply'd in their being ſuch, it will neceſſarily follow, that he could not receive his Being from them, and ſo muſt needs be from Eternity. And</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. As the Duration of God is from Eternity, ſo it is without Succeſſion. Years and Days cannot properly be aſcrib'd to him, no Times have paſſed over him, he enjoys himſelf in an everlaſting now! It cannot be properly ſaid, <hi>he was,</hi> but <hi>that he is,</hi> and hence is his Name I AM. <hi>One Day is therefore with him as a Thouſand Years, and a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Years as one Day.</hi> There can be no Succeſſion in the Duration of the Almighty, for the following Reaſons,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Becauſe it is Infinite. Now what is Infinite cannot
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:005500_0131_10396537E4858C60"/>
be meaſured by ſucceſſive Parts and Periods, for it has none.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. The Duration of God is unchangeable, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it hath no Succeſſion. This the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> confirms Pſal. cii. 27. <hi>Thou art the ſame and thy Years ſhall have no End.</hi> Now that which hath Succeſſion, is not the ſame, for every Moment adds ſomething to it which it had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>But 3dly, As the Almighty has no <hi>beginning</hi> or <hi>Succeſſion</hi> in Duration, thus he is likewiſe without <hi>End.</hi> Hence it is ſaid, that <hi>he liveth for ever and ever, and that his Years ſhall have no End, Rev.</hi> iv. 9, 10. <hi>Pſa.</hi> cii. 27. The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Arguments tend to eſtabliſh this Truth, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. God is a moſt ſimple Being, void of all Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore can never have an End from any neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Nature, there being no Tendency therein, to a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. It is true, compounded Beings becauſe of their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Parts, are liable to a Diſolution, which ariſes from the contrariety of thoſe Parts of which they are conſtituted, which tends to deſtroy each other, and ſo to diſſolve the Compound; but the Almighty hath no Parts.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. The <hi>Self-Exiſtence of God,</hi> which has been before prov'd, ſhews that as he could not begin to be, ſo neither can he ceaſe to be. For as <hi>Johovah</hi> has deriv'd his Being from none, ſo he depends upon none for its continuance. And ſeeing all Creatures owe their original to him, he has no equal, much leſs ſuperior, who can deprive him of his Exiſtence!</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. Neither can the Almighty Deſire or Will his own Deſtruction, for that is contrary to the Nature and Reaſon of Things. No wiſe Being poſſeſſed of compleat Happineſs, can Will the loſs thereof, becauſe Happineſs is the proper Object of deſire! Now a Diſtruction of the Being, would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:005500_0132_1039653662A8E108"/>
deſtroy the Happineſs poſſeſs'd by it; and therefore it cannot be deſired by God. Well then, if the Almighty cannot ceaſe to be from any neceſſity of Nature, or by the Will of another, or by any Act of his own, he muſt needs exiſt to Eternity. And</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. Eternity is peculiar to God: Tho' ſome Creatures be Everlaſting, as Angels and the Souls of Men, yet they had a Beginning, have Succeſſion in their Duration, and depend for its Continuance upon the Power and Will of God! and therefore their Duration is not neceſſary and independant. Whereas on the Contrary the Duration of God, as has been obſerv'd had no Beginning, has no Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, and neither ſhall have, nor can have an End.</p>
            <p>But becauſe Contraries ſerve to illuſtrate each other, let me obſerve ſomewhat concerning the <hi>Nature of Time:</hi> This is as ſome obſerve, the meaſure of the Creatures Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. It has no diſtinct Being of its own, but is an Adjunct or Quality that belongs to Creatures, which has theſe three ingredients in it, namely, 1ſt. <hi>A Beginning;</hi> that which once was not, muſt needs begin to be, if it exiſts at all: Thus at the Creation of the World, we read of the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Time, which ſhews that Creatures are the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of it, and meaſured by it. Time gives date to their Exiſtence.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. <hi>Time hath Succeſſion,</hi> it is not all at once, but flows by Degrees, it ſtands not, but is ſtill in Motion, it conſiſts of divers Parts or Moments, which are in a continual Flux, ſucceeding each other conſtantly, by theſe we calculate the Space or Term of a Creatures Exiſtence.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. <hi>Time hath</hi> alſo an <hi>End</hi> or <hi>Period,</hi> and this is reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Creature, when it ceaſes to be. The aforeſaid Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars give Room for our diſtinguiſhing Time into that which is paſt, preſent, and to come. <hi>Time paſt</hi> is all the Space
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:005500_0133_10396534DFDA4FE8"/>
or Duration, which the Creature has run thro' from its firſt Exiſtence to the preſent Point or Minute. <hi>Time preſent</hi> is the Moment of Exiſtence, which is now in being. <hi>Time to come,</hi> is that which remains of the Creatures appointed Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, until it expires. Now it's impoſſible to make thoſe different Periods of Time to ſubſiſt at once. Whereas on the contrary <hi>Eternity,</hi> as has been obſerv'd, is <hi>a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Now,</hi> having no <hi>Beginning, Succeſſion</hi> or <hi>End.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That we may have ſome Idea of the Eternity of God, it will not be improper to repreſent to ourſelves, certain temporal Spaces, and by thoſe to compaſs the divine Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as we cannot conceive of the divine Immenſity or Omnipreſence, without the Spaces of Place, ſo neither can we conceive of his Eternity without the Spaces of Time, but we ſhould be cautious in the mean Time, that we do not conceive theſe different Spaces to be real Beings, otherwiſe we ſhall conceive of many Eternals. And 2dly. That as in the Spaces of Place, we admit not of <hi>Extention,</hi> or of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions</hi> of Length and Breadth, ſo in the Spaces of Time, we admit not of Succeſſion, or a Flux of Moments.</p>
            <p>The Schoolmen truly deſcribe <hi>Eternity,</hi> 
               <q>to be an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, indiviſible, <hi>and</hi> independent Duration.</q> It is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminable,</hi> becauſe it wants Beginning and End. <hi>Indiviſible,</hi> becauſe it has <hi>no Succeſſion</hi> of <hi>Moments. Independent,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it has no Imperfection or Change, nor any Poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof.</p>
            <p>It is certain that the Almighty exiſts with all the Periods of Time, <hi>viz.</hi> paſt, preſent and future, immoveable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd, which the Antients did in ſome ſort ſhadow forth by a Circle, whoſe Center remain'd unmov'd, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of various Agitations in the Circumference. And the following Similitude may be uſed to the ſame End, <hi>viz.</hi> Of a Man ſitting by the Bank of a River, he ſees only the
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:005500_0134_10396533395D0730"/>
Water that is preſent, not that which is paſt, or that which is to come, but when he is lifted up on high, he ſees the whole River in its Spring, and Courſe, and Outlet, and it is preſent with him. Hence it appears, that in God there is nothing paſt, preſent, or to come, for theſe are but the Aſpects of Time, upon Creatures. Eternity admits of no Diviſions, all Things are preſent before God at once. Things move in reſpect of themſelves, but not in reſpect of God: He ſees them all at once, both paſt, preſent and to come. And tho' he is before, and in, and after all Time, for he has made it, yet it cauſes no Alteration in him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is no Subject of Time, and has no Dependance upon it. And for this Reaſon God cannot wax old, Time has no Relation to him, it cannot be the Meaſure of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, becauſe it is Eternal. And therefore when in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture, he is called <hi>the Antient of Days,</hi> it is only after the Manner of Men, to ſuit the Weakneſs of our Conception, which cannot form an Idea of Eternity, but under the Notion of an Infinite Space of Time.</p>
            <p>But the nobleſt Creatures, even the Angels, had a Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>once they were not.</hi> They have likewiſe a <hi>Succeſſion,</hi> being finite, they cannot poſſibly poſſeſs an Eternal now: And therefore their Duration muſt be progreſſive. And tho' they have no Tendency to Mortality in their Natures, yet are they dependant on their Creators Pleaſure, who can ſpeak them to nothing by the Word of his Power in a Moment. But an Objection may be offer'd againſt what has been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore aſſerted, namely this, <hi>is not the Creation of the World paſt, with God, when he made it in Six Days.</hi> Anſ. God's Acts are Two-Fold. 1ſt. <hi>Immanent</hi> terminated in himſelf. (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> i. 9.) Thoſe have no Succeſſion, the Almighty did not deviſe one Thing after another. 2dly <hi>Tranſient,</hi> in and upon the Creature, ſuch as Creation, Providence,
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:005500_0135_10396531403C2A58"/>
Vocation, &amp;c. And here we muſt diſtinguiſh between the Act it ſelf, and the Work produced by it. Gods Act in creating is the Act of his Will, that ſuch a Creature ſhould exiſt in Time, but if we conſider the Work itſelf produc'd, ſo the Creatures have a Being one after another.</p>
            <p>Is God <hi>Eternal?</hi> Then this <hi>ſhews,</hi> 1ſt. The <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Frailty</hi> of all Creatures, who are different from God, they are the Offſpring of Time, but he is the Father of Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. They are of Yeſterday and may ſoon ceaſe to be, but He, and He only, is from Everlaſting to Everlaſting! What if they ſhould ſubſiſt a Thouſand Years, this Space compar'd with Eternity is but as a Day, nay not ſo much, for between a Thouſand Years and a Day, there is ſome Proportion, but between a Thouſand Years and Eternity there is none! Yea if we conſider the Duration of Creatures abſolutely, without reſpect to Eternity, ſeeing it conſiſts of a continual Succeſſion, they ſubſiſt but for a Moment: For the Time paſt ceaſes to be, and the Time to come has not begun to be, and what then remains, but the preſent Moment? How fooliſh is it therefore, for ſuch as we are to be Proud, or to promiſe our ſelves any thing ſtable, any durable Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, from any fleeting Creature Enjoyment, whether of of Honour, Profit or Pleaſure? And how vain to ſet our Hearts upon that which is not? And on the Contrary how prudent is it for us to fix our ſupream Love upon an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal God, and him alone, that he may be our Habitation in all Generations? And,</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. This <hi>Subject affords</hi> great <hi>Comfort</hi> to all that are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Religious, amidſt all the Sorrows that ſpring from the fluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuating and uncertain State of Creature Enjoyments. Do our dear Friends and Relations die, and are our Goods ſnatch'd from us by Force or Fraud, or otherwiſe remov'd? Well this is our Comfort, that God lives, that he will remain
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:005500_0136_1039652F84355CB0"/>
forever and will never fail. Does Sin terrify us with its A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations, <hi>Behold the Mercy of God endures for ever,</hi> Pſal. ciii. 17. Are we in ſpiritual Deſertion, behold God is Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and his Love is like himſelf! <hi>Whom he loves, he loves to the End! For a ſmall Moment have I forſaken thee, but with great Mercy will I gather thee! In a little Wrath I hid my Face from thee; but with everlaſting Kindneſs will I have Mercy on thee, ſaith the Lord thy Redeemer,</hi> Iſa. liv. 7, 8. If under the Terrors of Death, how ſweet is it to meditate on the Eternity of God, who makes <hi>Death</hi> the Way to his Peoples enjoying eternal <hi>Life!</hi> And whatever other Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty we are under, how ſweet is it to think, that theſe light Afflictions, which are but for a Moment, do work for us an exceeding and eternal Weight of Glory. <hi>In the Lord Jehovah is everlaſting Strength,</hi> and from him we ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive everlaſting Love and Salvation! And ſurely this is an over Ballance for all the Miſeries of Life! But</p>
            <p n="3">3dly This Subject opens a Scene of <hi>Terror</hi> to unbelieving impenitent Sinners! God's Being is eternal, and ſo he will ever live to puniſh you. <hi>He is the living God, the everlaſting King, at his Wrath the Earth ſhall tremble, and the Nations ſhall not be able to abide his Indignation!</hi> Pſal. xc. 11. His Power is eternal, and thus he will be always able to make you inexpreſſibly miſerable, his Juſtice, Holineſs, Truth and Wrath, which incline him to exerciſe his Power againſt you, are eternal! <hi>Who knows the Power of thine Anger,</hi> ſays the <hi>Pſalmiſt, According to thy Fear ſo is thy Wrath,</hi> xc. 11. <hi>It is a fearful Thing to fall into the Hands of the living or eternal God!</hi> Heb. x. 31. Beſides Sin, without a Pardon thro' a Mediator, is <hi>Eternal!</hi> The Sinner is likewiſe <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal!</hi> The Priſon of Hell <hi>Eternal!</hi> The Fire of Hell kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Breath of God like a River of Brimſtone <hi>Eternal!</hi> The Puniſhment of Loſs, <hi>viz.</hi> the Privation of an infinite
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:005500_0137_1039652DF99754F8"/>
Good <hi>Eternal!</hi> The Puniſhment of Senſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the Worm of Conſcience <hi>Eternal!</hi> And all this for the momentary Enjoyment of Sin. Should not all theſe Things incline us. to avoid and deteſt Sin, and likewiſe to bewail it, and ſeek a Remedy in him who has brought in everlaſting Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</p>
            <p>In fine, the Eternity of God ſweetly invites to glorify God on account of this divine Perfection, by high Thoughts of God, and humble Acknowledgments of this adorable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, as well as by earneſt ſeeking of God, and placing our Happineſs in him alone, and not in the fleeting Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments of Time. O let us believe, ſtudy, and live to <hi>Eternity!</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> iv. 18. <hi>While we look not at the Things which are ſeen, but at the Things which are not ſeen: For the Things which are ſeen are Temporal, but the Things which are not ſeen are</hi> Eternal! Let us moſt firmly believe the <hi>Eternity</hi> of the divine <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Attributes,</hi> as well as of a future State of Rewards and Puniſhments, which will much influence our whole Life to Vertue and Goodneſs! Let us daily ſpend a little Time in meditating on <hi>Eternity,</hi> that we may apprehend ſomewhat of its awful Nature, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible Moment to us, either in our Salvation or Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and finally let us live to <hi>Eternity,</hi> let us think of it, ſpeak of it, intend it, and labour for it, above any Thing elſe. Let us work, and ſuffer, and pray for a happy <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. This, this</hi> is only worthy of our ſupream Affections and vigorous Purſuits. <hi>If we are riſen with CHRIST, let us ſet our Affections on the Things above.</hi>

            <p>But I proceed to diſcourſe upon the 4th divine <hi>Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute,</hi> which I obſerv'd was included, in the <hi>Words</hi> I AM, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Immutability</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> In treating upon which, I ſhall

            <p n="1">1ſt. The Scripture proves this many Ways, 1ſt. By re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving all Shadow of <hi>Change</hi> from God. <hi>Jam.</hi> i. 17. <hi>with whom there is no</hi> Change <hi>or Shadow of turning.</hi> The Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Words <hi>(parallage &amp; tropes apoſciaſma)</hi> here us'd, are a Metaphor borrow'd from the Sun, which as Aſtronomers ſay, has its Paralaxes or various Aſpects. It appears other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways at its riſing in the Eaſt, from what it does at its ſetting in the Weſt, it likewiſe appears differently at Mid Day, it hath alſo various Changes, ſometimes it ſhines, and ſome times its clouded with an Eclipſe. It likewiſe changes its Place moving from Eaſt to Weſt, from one Tropick to another, ſometimes it draws nearer to us, and ſome Times goes farther from us, cauſing a longer Shadow, but the Apoſtle aſſures us, <hi>that the uncreated Father of Light</hi> has none of theſe Alterations. And</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. Sometimes the Scriptures remove from God thoſe Things that imply a Change. <hi>e. g. Repentance</hi> Num. xxiii. 19. <hi>God is not a Man that he ſhould lie, neither the Son of Man that he ſhould repent.</hi> 1 Sam. xv. 29. <hi>And alſo the Strength of Iſrael will not lie, nor repent, for he is not a Man that he ſhould repent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3dly. Sometimes it <hi>aſſerts</hi> his <hi>immutability</hi> expreſly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> cii. 27. <hi>But thou art the ſame, and thy Years ſhall have no End.</hi> Some of the antient <hi>Fathers</hi> have ſpoken well upon this Head, particularly theſe following <hi>viz. Proclus</hi> in a Sermon concerning Faith ſayeth,
<q>That the Deity remains Superior to all Mutability. Change is a Paſſion of a fluent Nature, but Immutability is proper to an Eternal Nature that is always the ſame.</q>
               <hi>Hillarie</hi> in his Book concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Trinity ſays <q>I think not that God is changeable. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Vice, Amendment, Progreſs, or Loſs, happens to the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:005500_0139_1039652AB59FB110"/>
but what he is he always is.</q>
               <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in the Preface of his fourth Book concerning the Trinity ſayeth,
<q>that the divine Eſſence, hath nothing mutable, either in his <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Verity</hi> or <hi>Will.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And right Reaſon likewiſe gives its ſuffrage to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability of God, as appears by the following Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. God is a moſt ſimple Being, and therefore cannot be chang'd: For Change, being an altering Viciſſitude, would deſtroy his Being intirely, when that which is moſt ſimple is changed, nothing remains of what it was before, and thus it is deſtroy'd entirely. Thus you ſee, it is Atheiſm to aſcribe Change to the Almighty.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. God is a moſt perfect, yea infinitely perfect Being, and therefore cannot be chang'd, becauſe to that which is perfect, no Good can be added. If God be chang'd, it muſt be either into a worſe or better State, or into a Condition equal to what he was before. But he can't be chang'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a worſe State, for then he would be imperfect after the Change, and ſo no God. Nor into a better, for then he would be imperfect before the Change &amp; ſo no God. Nor can he paſs into an equal State to what he was before, for this implies an equal Proportion of Loſs and Gain, and thus there would be more infinitely perfect Beings than one, and ſo more Gods, which is impoſſible, and blaſphemous to imagine.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. Seeing the Almighty is abſolutely the firſt Being, he cannot be changed, for whatſoever is chang'd, is chang'd by one prior to itſelf, but this in reſpect of God is impoſſible, for none can be before the Firſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. Seeing the Almighty is incorruptible, he cannot be chang'd: For what is a Change of the beſt Being, elſe but a Corruption of it?</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. God is infinite and therefore cannot be changed by adding any Thing to him or diminiſhing any Thing from
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:005500_0140_10396528C138E978"/>
him; for if he were capable of Addition, he muſt be finite before the Change; and if of Diminution, he muſt be finite after it, and ſo neither Ways the true God. For as Infinity is an eſſential Character of God, ſo this is incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of more or leſs: For then there wou'd be an Infinite which was more than Infinite, and ſo an Infinite which is not Infinite; which is ridiculous! But I proceed to the</p>
            <p n="2">2d. Propoſed, which was to <hi>explain the Nature of God's Immutability.</hi> And here it may be obſerv'd, that God's <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability</hi> may be thus deſcrib'd, viz. <hi>That it is an eſſential Perfection of the divine Nature, whereby the Almighty is without all poſſibility of any Kind of Change.</hi> In order to explain this Diſcription, let the following particulars be conſidered.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. That when we call God's immutability a <hi>Perfection,</hi> we ſuppoſe his Goodneſs and Excellency, otherwiſe it would be no Perfection; but the Contrary to be immutable in Sin and Miſery is the higheſt pitch of both, which is the dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Caſe of damned Angels and damned Souls!</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. <hi>Immutability,</hi> in ſtrict propriety, belongs only to God. Hence it is ſaid, <hi>that he only hath Immortality,</hi> 1. Tim vi. 16. His <hi>immutability</hi> is underiv'd and independent, whereas the <hi>immutability</hi> of all Creatures is dependent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe deriv'd. It is borrow'd from the Power and meer Pleaſure of God, and therefore, its Duration is entirely and perpetually Subject thereto! The viſible Heavens of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate Beings ſeem to be the moſt free from Corruption, and even theſe are lyable to it. Pſal cii. 25.26. <hi>Of Old thou thou haſt laid the Foundations of the Earth and the Heavens are the Work of thy Hands, they ſhall periſh, but thou ſhalt endure, yea all of them ſhall wax old as a Garment.</hi> Yea the moſt noble Creatures in Heaven it ſelf are ſubject to change; the Angels are capable of new Additions to their
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:005500_0141_103965271B64AA30"/>
Happineſs, for new Object may be offer'd to incite their Praiſe, and this tends to increaſe their Felicity. The Angels doubtleſs know more now concerning the Myſteries of the Goſpel, than before the Incarnation of our Saviour; hence they are ſaid <hi>to know,</hi> by the Church, <hi>the manifold Wiſdom of God,</hi> Eph. iii. 10. and <hi>to deſire to look into theſe Things,</hi> 1 Pet. i. 11, 12. The Happineſs of all Creatures admits of Degrees, and ſo of Change, becauſe they are finite: But God is Infinite and ſo peculiarly <hi>immutable!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3dly. Creatures may be chang'd two Ways, either 1ſt. <hi>Outwardly,</hi> in reſpect of Time and Place: Things that are the Off-ſpring of Time, are ſubject to it and changed by it <hi>outwardly,</hi> they grow older: They are likewiſe chang'd <hi>outwardly</hi> when they move from Place to Place. 2dly. Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are likewiſe liable to change in reſpect of their <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Faculties;</hi> but the Almighty is capable of neither of theſe nor any other Change, as will appear by the following Induction of particulars. And 1ſt. The Almighty is not chang'd in reſpect of <hi>Place,</hi> becauſe he is Immenſe and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, and cannot be meaſured by Space. Nor 2dly. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of <hi>Time,</hi> becauſe he is Eternal, and ſo no ſubject of Time, as has been before obſerv'd. Nor 3dly. Can the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty be chang'd in reſpect of <hi>Accidents,</hi> becauſe they are not applicable to him, on account of the Simplicity of his Being. Hence every Thing that is in God is himſelf, he is <hi>true, juſt, wiſe,</hi> &amp;c. by his <hi>Eſſence.</hi> Neither</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. Can the Almighty be chang'd in reſpect of his <hi>Eſſence.</hi> For this ſuppos'd Change muſt be either effected by himſelf or another: not by himſelf, becauſe there is no tendency in his Nature to a Change, it being void of all Compoſition! Neither can it be reaſonably ſuppos'd that an infinitely Wiſe and perfectly Happy Being would Will a Change in his own Happineſs, ſeeing there is no Neceſſity
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:005500_0142_103965259869DCD8"/>
for ſuch a change, were it poſſible. Neither can another change the divine <hi>Eſſence,</hi> ſeeing that all are inferior to God; for he that changes another muſt be ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to him whom he changes. Nor 5thly. Is the Almighty chang'd in his <hi>Perfections</hi> or <hi>Faculties</hi> which are indeed in him the ſame with his <hi>Eſſence,</hi> altho' in our manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of them they are diſtinguiſh'd, to which God is pleaſed to accommodate himſelf in his Word, by aſſuming to himſelf an <hi>Underſtanding, Will, Affections,</hi> all which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf are by conſequence <hi>immutable.</hi> And</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. God is <hi>Immutable</hi> in his <hi>Underſtanding.</hi> A Change of Sentiments implies Weakneſs; to increaſe in Knowledge ſuppoſes Ignorance, and to decline in Knowledge is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to a ſtate of Ignorance, both which are equally incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Perfection of the divine Mind!</p>
            <p>The Knowledge of God is not deriv'd from outward Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as that of Creatures is, and ſo is not dependent on them, and by conſequence not altered by their Changes.</p>
            <p>Again, the Knowledge of Creatures is ſomething diſtinct, from the Faculty receiving, and ſo may be increas'd or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh'd: But in God it is himſelf or his Being, it is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than God knowing: And therefore if this were changed, the Being of God muſt be chang'd alſo, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.</p>
            <p>The ſacred Scriptures aſſure us, <hi>that God's Underſtanding is Infinite,</hi> Pſal. cxlvii. 5. And if ſo, it muſt be unchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, for what is Infinite admits of no degrees. More it cannot be, for Nothing can be greater than Infinite; nor leſs, for than it would not be Infinite. God knows all Things in Eternity in himſelf with one glance. Hence he is call'd <hi>the only wiſe God,</hi> 1 Tim. i. 17. and that <hi>all his Works are known to him from the beginning of the World,</hi> Act. xv. 18.</p>

God is <hi>unchangeable</hi> in his <hi>Will,</hi> altho' his Will is free, it is nevertheleſs Conſtant and Eternal. <hi>He is in one Mind and who can turn him,</hi> ſayeth <hi>Job</hi> Chap. 23.13. and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, <hi>tho' there be many deviſes in Man's Heart, yet the Council of the Lord that ſhall ſtand.</hi> Now the Truth of this will farther appear, if we conſider the following Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, viz.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. If the <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Purpoſe</hi> of God were chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, than the State of the beſt Men would be render'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding precarious and miſerable; for then the ſpecial Gifts of God vouchſafed at one Time, might be remov'd at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and then the Condition of the moſt Devout would be as perilous as that of Rope-Dancers, who are every Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in danger of breaking their Necks. But the ſacred. Scriptures aſſure us, <hi>that the Gifts and Calling of God are without Repentance,</hi> Rom. xi. 29. And</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. If the Will of God were not <hi>unchangable,</hi> than he would neither be the Object of Truſt or Fear; for then, from the mutability of his Nature, both his Promiſes and Threats might be revers'd, and ſo the former would not merit our Confidence, nor the latter our Dread! And thus Hope and Fear, the great Springs of Religion, would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. Inaſmuch as the <hi>Will of God</hi> is really himſelf, and is diſtinguiſhed from his <hi>Eſſence</hi> only in our Conception, (modaly) then if his <hi>Will</hi> was changed, it would follow neceſſarily, that himſelf was chang'd, which cannot be, for the Reaſons before mention'd. And,</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. Seeing that the Almighty <hi>Wills</hi> and <hi>Purpoſes</hi> with infinite Wiſdom and Council, upon a ſure and unalterable Foundation, whatſoever ſhall come to paſs, it cannot be that his Will ſhould Change. But to make this more Plain and Evident, let me offer the following induction of Particulars
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:005500_0144_103965224BACEC10"/>
to prove that none of thoſe Things that induce Men to change their Purpoſes, can be apply'd to God. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Sometimes Men are <hi>compell'd</hi> to change their Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes by the Threats of Superiors, or by ſome other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of coertion: But none is God's equal, much leſs his ſuperior, and therefore no conſtraint can be laid upon him! Iſa. xiv. 27. <hi>For the Lord of Hoſts hath purpoſed and who ſhall diſanul it? And his Hand is ſtretched out, and who ſhall turn it back?</hi> Pſal. cxv. 3. <hi>But our God is in the Heavens, he hath done whatſoever he pleaſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly, Sometimes Men change their Purpoſes for want of Power to compaſs them, this has rendered many well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed Schemes abortive! But the Deſigns of God cannot be mar'd thro' Impotency, becauſe he is infinite in Strength.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, Men ſometimes alter their Purpoſes, becauſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unforeſeen and unexpected happens, which gives ſuch a turn to the Scene of Affairs, as makes an Alteration ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. But to aſcribe this to God, is to deſtroy his Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and the infinity of his Knowledge; and ſo by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to deny him to be God.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly, Men change their Purpoſes ſometimes through a natural Fickleneſs and Inſtability, which makes them in a little ſpace of Time for and againſt a Thing, and proceeds partly from Ignorance, and partly from the moveableneſs of their Affections; none of which can de aſcrib'd to God, he being <hi>immutable</hi> in his Nature, muſt be ſo alſo in his Purpoſe or Will.</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. Men change their Purpoſes in promiſing, and not fulfilling what they promiſe, from the Corruption of their Nature: But God is invioably Holy, and therefore cannot Change in this reſpect.</p>
            <p n="6">6thly. Men ſometimes change their Purpoſes becauſe they were raſhly made, without a thorough Knowledge of Things
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:005500_0145_1039652048212570"/>
and due Conſideration upon them: But neither of theſe can be aſcrib'd to God, <hi>for as he is Infinite in Knowledge, ſo he Works all Things after the Council of his Will,</hi> as the Apoſtle obſerves, Eph. i. 11. But I proceed to the</p>
            <p n="3">3. Propos'd, which was to <hi>anſwer ſome Objections.</hi> And 1ſt. The <hi>Pelagians, Semipelagians, Jeſuits, Arminians</hi> and <hi>Remonſtrants,</hi> object, <hi>That by the aforeſaid</hi> Immutability <hi>our</hi> Free-Will <hi>would be deſtroy'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No! By no Means, becauſe the freedom of our Will conſiſts in a freedom from Force or Co-action, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of acting by Council or with rational Complacency, and not in any independent indifferency to contraries, which is not hurt by the <hi>Immutability</hi> of God, but rather eſtabliſhed. For God has purpoſed that every Agent ſhall act according to his Kind. Natural Agents neceſſarily <hi>(ad ultimum ſui poſſe)</hi> to the extent of their Power; thus Fire burns, and Water wets as much as they can. And rational Agents, voluntarily or freely. If Liberty conſiſted in indifferency to contraries, then God himſelf, Angels and glorified Saints, would be depriv'd of it, for they have an eternal contrariety to Sin, and an eternal propenſity to Holineſs! And to ſuppoſe Creatures independent in Willing or Acting, is to ſuppoſe them to be Gods, becauſe then they would not be under the Government of the Almighty. A Creature may as well exiſt of itſelf as act of itſelf. Second Cauſes muſt needs depend on the firſt in Being and Acting, for <hi>in him we live, move and have our Being.</hi> And as Divines juſtly obſerve, <hi>(operari Sequitur eſſe) Action follows the Kind of the Being it proceeds from.</hi> Independent Action follows an indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Being; and dependent Action, a dependent one, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Effect would exceed the Vertue of the producing Cauſe, which is abſurd! A</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="143" facs="unknown:005500_0146_1039651E65E64540"/>2d. Objection is this, <hi>That by the aforeſaid</hi> Immutability, <hi>God himſelf would not have a free Will, becauſe according to it, he could not alter a conceiv'd Reſolve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> God Almighty Wills, what he Wills, of rational Complacency, and therefore Wills it freely. He acts accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Nature, and therefore freely. To ſuppoſe that God can't Act freely without croſſing his Nature, is to deſtroy the Happineſs and Simplicity of God, and ſo by conſequence his very Being, and to aſſert, that Liberty conſiſts in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, which is a Contradiction. A</p>
            <p n="3">3d. Objection is, <hi>God threatens ſome Things which come not to paſs, as in the Caſes of</hi> Hezekiah <hi>and</hi> Nineveh, (2. <hi>Kings</hi> xx. i. <hi>Jonah</hi> iii. 4.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> God diſpenſeth his abſolute Purpoſes to his Creatures by conditional Promiſes and Threatnings; and tho' the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Faith and Repentance be not always expreſſed, yet they are imply'd. Jer. xviii. 7, 8. <hi>If I ſpeak concerning a Nation to deſtroy it, if that Nation againſt whom I have pronounced, turn from their Evil, I will Repent of the Evil I tho't to do unto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Objection 4. <hi>God is ſaid to repent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> It's elſe where ſaid, <hi>that he is not a Man that he ſhould repent,</hi> i. e. He can't repent as Men do by chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Purpoſe, and in being ſorry for what he has done. All that looks like Repentance in God, is an Alteration of the Courſe of his Providence towards his Creatures, and this is a change of the Work, not of the Workman, and its only on this Account that Repentance is aſcrib'd to God.</p>
            <p>Objection 5. <hi>God Wills and makes mutable Things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> He does ſo, but after an immutable Manner, even as by his Eternity, which is deſtitute of all Succeſſion, he directs ſucceſſive and mutable Things. Its true the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:005500_0147_1039651CE3F7BF98"/>
of God's Will may be changed, whereby that may be rendered a Duty at one Time which is not at another, as appears from the <hi>Ceremonial Law:</hi> But theſe Changes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before determined by God, make no Alteration in his Will, as <hi>Aquinas</hi> obſerves, <q>It's one Thing to change the Will and another to Will a Change.</q> As St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayeth, <q>The Change is in us, not in God, as Houſes and Trees ſeem to move to thoſe that are in a Ship, but the Ship moves and they ſtand firm.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Objection 6. <hi>The ſecond Perſon of the Trinity was made Man in Time, which he was not before, and ſo was chang'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer with <hi>Wendeline,</hi>
               <q>He aſſumed the human Nature, but was not changed into it, and this was but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to an Act of his Will from Eternity, and therefore he was not chang'd, for all poſitive change is by ſuffering.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Objection 7. <hi>God is ſaid to ſuffer Death.</hi> Act. xx. 28.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> He did ſuffer it, but not in himſelf, but in the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed human Nature, and ſo is not chang'd.</p>
            <p>Objection 8. <hi>God created the World in Time, which he did not from Eternity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> He did ſo, but by that Power which is Eternal and Immutable. Creation is nothing elſe but an Act of God's Will from Eternity that the World ſhould exiſt in Time. Here the Creature is altered, but not the Will of God. Neither does any Thing accrue to God by the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but a meer Relation, which infers no change in him!</p>
            <p>Object. 9. <hi>What God Wills is not always done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yes, what he Wills is done, but in the Manner he Wills. If he Wills only by commanding that the Thing Commanded be our Duty, then that is done: If he Wills by decreeing that any Thing ſhould exiſt, then it does exiſt.</p>
            <p>Object. 10. <hi>God loves ſome Men whom he before hated,</hi> viz. <hi>the Elect that are called, and therefore he is changed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="145" facs="unknown:005500_0148_1039651B6004B760"/>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Rational Affections are but Acts of the Will or its Poſtures to an Object, and theſe are ever the ſame in God. Love or Hatred, as they are Paſſions, can't be properly aſcrib'd to God, for ſuch would deſtroy his Happineſs, Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and Perfection, and therefore they intend no more but his Purpoſe to confer Benefits upon his Creatures in Time, or to puniſh them together with the Execution thereof, which is no more than an Act of his Will from Eternity, together with his Providence purſuant thereto in Time: Or they intend that Perſons who were before expoſed to the Curſe of the Law, are now according to God's eternal Purpoſe delivered therefrom, which makes a Change in the Creatures State but not in God.</p>
            <p>Object. 11. <hi>The Scriptures repreſent the Almighty as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Complacency in his People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Its true; but this ſhews only the Creatures confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to God's Nature, and therefore ſignifies a Change in it, but not in him. The Sun which was troubleſome to ſore Eyes, is pleaſant to them, being heal'd: Here the Sun is not chang'd, but the Eyes.</p>
            <p>Object. 12. <hi>If God be immutable, then what ſignifies Prayer, or the Uſe of any other Means?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Deſign of <hi>Prayer,</hi> is not to move God, but our ſelves, to expreſs our Allegiance to him, and get Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for the Mercies he offers. Moreover it may be obſerved, that Prayer is a mean in the Uſe of which God is wont to confer Mercy. Now he immutably Wills the Mean, as well as the End. But I proceed to the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now from what has been ſaid, we may learn, 1ſt. The <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Emptineſs</hi> of all Creatures, God alone is immutable, every thing under the Sun beſides him, is frail and fleeting, and hath no abiding! The World is a roling Wheel, and every thing in it, is ſubject to change and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:005500_0149_103965199C0971C8"/>
yea even thoſe Things, that ſeem moſt Specious and Stable, are in a continual Whirle-pool of Change, <hi>viz.</hi> Nobles, Princes, Kings common Wealths, Kingdoms and Empires: Both Scripture and Hiſtory inform us, of the Cataſtrophes, or Deſolations, every of thoſe is Subject to! Riches make to themſelves Wings oftentimes and fly away; Honour is but an inſtable blaſt, often times conferr'd with as little Judgment as it is remov'd; and Pleaſure has no ſtability: As for the Love of Friends, it often changes with the Wind: How fooliſh is it therefore to over love or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide in ſuch changeing Shadows of Good? God is the only Object worthy of our Love and Confidence! Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>uſe theſe Things as tho' we uſed them not,</hi> with due Weanedneſs and Moderation, and acquieſs in the immutable God only. And</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. Hence we learn the great ground of the <hi>Saints Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi> Is it any Thing in them, or any Thing reſolved or done by them? No, they are but Creatures, their Grace might fail, as appears from the fall of the Angels, and of our firſt Parents, and their Reſolutions might alter; but the immutability of God cannot. And this is the Ground of the Saints Perſeverance. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.6. <hi>I am the Lord: I change not, therefore the Sons of</hi> Jacob <hi>are not conſumed.</hi> God has fix'd his everlaſting Love upon them, he has made an everlaſting Covenant with them, and given his unchangeable Promiſe to them, <hi>that he will never leave them,</hi> and will he, can he go back, and ſuffer his Faithfulneſs to fail? No, its impoſſible.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, Hence we may learn, the awful Caſe of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally impenitent. That God is unchangable, who hath threatned to curſe and deſtroy them, and this they muſt everlaſtingly endure. After the Day of his Mercy expires, he will be inexorable to all the Cries and Importunities of the Wicked; their dreadful Doom ſhall never be reverſed; their intolerable and inexpreſſible Plagues, ſhall be immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:005500_0150_10396517E03C26C8"/>
and eternal! God is in every reſpect Immutable, viz. in his <hi>Eſſence,</hi> in his <hi>Attributes</hi> of <hi>Juſtice, Wrath,</hi> and <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred</hi> againſt Sin and Sinners; in his <hi>Threatnings</hi> as well as in the Execution of them, which ſhall have no Remiſſion in Degree, and know no End! O, ſhould not theſe ſolemn Conſiderations frighten Impenitents from Sin and Security, to God and Goodneſs!</p>
            <p n="4">4thly, Hence we learn alſo the great Ground Believers have to truſt and rejoyce in God in every Immergent. God is the only Object worthy of our Truſt, for he always remains the ſame, and will never fail them. He is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable Rock, the unſhaken Foundation upon which his Church is Built; againſt which the Gates of Hell ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver prevail. When we are perplex'd with a Sight and Senſe of our own Treachery and Weakneſs, compar'd with the Strength and Policy of our Enemies, or with a view of the many Viciſſitudes, Wars, Confuſions, Calamities, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſes, and Deaths, which mankind are involv'd in and expos'd to. What is a ſweeter Support than to think God is a Rock, whoſe Foundation ſtands ſure; <hi>the Lord knows who are his:</hi> That his ſaving Gifts are without Repentance, and that <hi>Jehovah</hi> in the midſt of thoſe Changes, will be unmov'd to his own, and preſent with them by his Strengh, that they may not be mov'd, that he will remain Immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in his Love and Grace, in his Purpoſe and Promiſes, which are ſo many and ſo great! And why then may we not with the pious Prophet triumphing ſay, <hi>Altho' the Fig Tree ſhall not Bloſom, neither ſhall fruit be in the Vines, the Labour of the Olive ſhall fail, And the Field ſhall yield no Meat, the Flock ſhall be cut off from the Fold, and there ſhall be no Herd in the Stalls; yet I will rejoice in the Lord and joy in the God of my Salvation!</hi> What tho' all beneath the Sun, were in a tumultuous Uproar: Our Rock <hi>Jehovah</hi> is unmov'd, and therefore let us truſt and joy in him!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="148" facs="unknown:005500_0151_1039651645408350"/>But in the laſt Place, let us be exhorted to glorify the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible and immutable God by our Thoughts, Speech and Practice. Let us think <hi>highly,</hi> and ſpeak <hi>reverently</hi> of this venerable Attribute of God, leaſt with the Gentile Philoſophers, while we profeſs our ſelves to be wiſe, we become Fools, and change the Glory of the incorruptible God! But eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially let us glorify God in life by avoiding all inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in our pious Purpoſes and Promiſes made in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant entred into at our Baptiſm, and renew'd at the Lords Supper: And O let us not be unſtable in our Profeſſion of CHRIST'S Truth! Or in love to him, or in the Practice of Piety! For by Levity and Inconſtancy we contradict the Example of the immutable God, in imitation of whom our Perfection con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts. Let us therefore be Stedfaſt in all the Duties we owe to God and Man: And particularly let us be immoveable in our adhering to the <hi>Truths of God,</hi> which are the <hi>Ground</hi> of all rational Religion. Without this, nothing remains but Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Enthuſiaſm and Nonſenſe! O Let us not <hi>he as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren toſſed about with every Wind of Doctrine, thro' the Craft and Jugling of thoſe that lye in wait to deceive!</hi> O let us beware of Wolves in Sheeps clothing!

                  <p>God is a Spirit, and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in Spirit and in Truth.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THESE Words are Part of our Lord's Anſwer to the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> concerning what ſhe had ſaid reſpecting worſhipping God upon a particular Mountain, by which our Saviour informs her, and us by her, that the Ceremonial and Typical Sanctity or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of Places, which obtain'd under the Jewiſh Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, is now under the New-Teſtament remov'd; and that ſincere Service or Worſhip, is accepted of by God every where, without any reſpect had to the Place where it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd.</p>
            <p>Now the Text we are conſidering contains three Things, 1ſt. A <hi>general Deſcription of God,</hi> viz. that <hi>he is a Spirit.</hi> God is call'd a Spirit, 1ſt. <hi>negatively,</hi> becauſe he is not a Body, 2dly. <hi>Analogically,</hi> 
               <q>becauſe there are many Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency's in ſpiritual Subſtances, which do more ſhadow forth the Divine Nature, than any Bodily Thing can.</q> As Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> obſerves in his <hi>Medulla.</hi> 3dly. God is call'd a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>eminently,</hi> inaſmuch as he is moſt remote from all manner of Compoſition. And altho' Angels and the Souls of Men, have a kind of Simplicity, yet the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty infinitely exceeds them therein: For whatſoever is
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:005500_0153_1039651331569D80"/>
affirm'd of God, which is communicable to Creatures, the ſame muſt be underſtood to be in him, in a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and ſingular Manner, and in an infinitely greater De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. The third Perſon of the Trinity is not only call'd a Spirit, <hi>hypoſtatically,</hi> and by Way of Apropriation, becauſe of his Proceſſion from the Father and the Son by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ineffable Breathing, but alſo every Perſon of the ſacred Trinity, is call'd Spirit, <hi>eſſentially,</hi> becauſe they all have the ſame immaterial Eſſence.</p>
            <p>But 2dly. We have in the Text before us, a <hi>Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>that Worſhip</hi> which is only acceptable to God, and this conſiſts of two Parts, <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Truth.</hi> 1ſt.

            <p n="1">1ſt. Spirits are <hi>impalpable,</hi> they cannot be felt, they are inacceſſible to our Senſes, which require a Bodily Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. The Reaſon is this, that which is felt, muſt be more groſs than our Animal Spirits, which feel it. But Angelical Subſtances are much finer than our ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Spirits, which are made of the Coarſe Elements, and therefore cannot be felt by them.

his Diſciples by this Argument of Senſe, that he was no Spirit. <hi>Luke</hi> xxiv. 39. <hi>Behold my Hands and my Feet, that it is I my Self, handle me and ſee, for a Spirit hath not Fleſh and Bones as ye ſee me have.</hi> And God himſelf is much more <hi>impalpable.</hi> And hence the Apoſtle Paul ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves in his Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> vi. 16. <hi>That the Lord of Lords only hath Immortality, dwelling in the Light, which no Man can approach unto.</hi> Tho' <hi>we live and move in God, and have our Being from him,</hi> yet we are inſenſible of his <hi>eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Preſence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly Spirits are <hi>inviſible Subſtances,</hi> 1ſt. They are <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances</hi> not Accidents, for Accidents are but Qualities clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to a <hi>Subſtance,</hi> which are therefore variable and Depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, as for Example, Whitneſs in the Wall: Whereas Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are Exiſtences by themſelves, and God who is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Spirits, Exiſts of himſelf abſolutely, 2dly. Spirits are <hi>inviſible,</hi> as well as <hi>intangible,</hi> and the Reaſon is, becauſe what is ſeen, muſt be groſſer than the Medium of Air, thro' which we ſee, and groſſer than the Animal Spirits by which we ſee; but Angelical <hi>Subſtances</hi> are finer than both, and therefore inviſible to us. Neither does their aſſuming in Antient Times human Bodies, or ſome groſs Matter in the Form of them, and appearing to <hi>Abram</hi> and others, in the leaſt contradict this: For it was the Body aſſum'd that was ſeen, and not they. And how much more is God himſelf inviſible, who infinitely exceeds all created Spirits, in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime Excellency. Hence he is call'd the <hi>King, Immortal, Eternal, Inviſible.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> i. 17.

And hence it is, <hi>that the Almighty is ſaid to dwell in ſecret.</hi> Mat. vi. 6.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. Spirits are in their <hi>Nature Immortal,</hi> having nothing in their Conſtitution tending to change or Corruption, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

they conſiſt not of various Parts, as Bodies do, which may be diſunited; and thus have their Form alter'd. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are Spirits, becauſe of the Subtilty and fineneſs of their Nature, ſo lyable to Impreſſions by inferior Beings, as Bodies are, but ſtill they are ſubject to the Controle of him, who gave them Being.

            </p>
            <p n="4">4thly. Spirits are the moſt <hi>perfect and excellent Beings.</hi> The Souls of Men and Angels, are much more noble than Bodies, and all Beings purely Material, and how infinitely does the bleſſed God exceed the ſublimeſt Seraphims, in Excellency and Perfection?</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. Spirits are the <hi>ſtrongeſt</hi> of <hi>created Beings,</hi> hence they are call'd <hi>Principallties</hi> and <hi>Powers</hi> and ſaid to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel in Strength. <hi>Pſa.</hi> ciii. 20. <hi>Bleſs ye the Lord his Angels, that excel in Strength.</hi> And hence the Weakneſs of Fleſh is oppos'd to Spirit. <hi>Iſa.</hi> xxxi. 3. <hi>And is not</hi> Jehovah <hi>wiſe in Heart, and mighty in Strength? Who has hardened him ſelf againſt God and proſpered?</hi> The combin'd Strength of all the Angels, together with the whole <hi>Poſſe</hi> of created Beings, is no more in Compariſon of the Power of God, <hi>than a Drop to the great Ocean, or a little Duſt in the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance with the whole Earth. The Almighty takes up the Iſles as a very little Thing, and all Nations before him are as No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and they are counted to him leſs than Nothing, and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> Iſa. xl. 15, 17.</p>
            <p n="6">6thly. Spirits are the moſt <hi>nimble</hi> in their <hi>Motions,</hi> and <hi>unwearied</hi> in their Actings, of all created Beings. One of them is ſaid fly from the third Heaven to the Earth in a few Hours (<hi>Dan.</hi> xxi. 22.) Now ſeeing God himſelf is a pure Act, muſt he not of Conſequence, be the moſt agile and active of all Beings, hence he is figuratively repreſented by the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> to ride upon a Cherubim, <hi>and fly upon the
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:005500_0157_1039650C62A070E0"/>
Wings of the Wind, Pſ.</hi> xviii. 10. And hence <hi>Iſaiah</hi> obſerves, that the <hi>Creator of the Ends of the Earth fainteth not, neither is weary. Iſa.</hi> xl. 28.</p>
            <p n="7">7thly. Spirits are endow'd with <hi>Underſtandings</hi> and <hi>Wills,</hi> &amp; are capable of putting forth Actions agreeable thereto, which Beings purely Material, have no Capacity for. <hi>e. g.</hi> The Sun tho' it be a Beautiful Creature, becauſe material, is not capable of Tho't or moral Action, both which Angels and the Souls of Men can exert. And hath not God himſelf an Underſtanding that is Infinite, and a Will which no created Power can control?</p>
            <p>But tho' there be ſome likeneſs between God and the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in ſome Things, yet it muſt be ſtill remembred, that he infinitely tranſcends their nobleſt Excellency's and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Things is unlike them <hi>Pſal.</hi> cxlviii. 13. <hi>Let them Praiſe the Name of the Lord, for his Name alone is excellent, and his Glory is above the Earth and Heaven.</hi> This leads to the</p>
            <p n="3">3d. General Head which was to ſhew the Diſſimulitude or Unlikeneſs been God and created Spirits, even of the higheſt order, which appears in the following Inſtances, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. The Excellencies of created Spirits are <hi>deriv'd</hi> from him to whom they owe their Beings, who is therefore ſtil'd the <hi>Father of Spirits, and the God of the Spirits of all Fleſh,</hi> Heb. xii. 9. But as the Almighty had no Beginning of Exiſtence, conſequently his Perfections muſt be unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd and Eternal.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. The Excellencies of created Spirits, are but <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative, viz.</hi> that they excell the beſt of material Beings in their Nature and Properties, whereas the Bleſſed God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells both material and immaterial.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. The Beings and Excellencies of created Spirits are <hi>limitted,</hi> their being Creatures proves them to be finite. He that made them muſt needs give Bounds to their Beings,
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:005500_0158_1039650A9E8C01E0"/>
ſo that they cannot fill all Places at once. And Infinite Excellency's cannot be poſſeſs'd by any Thing that is in its Nature finite. But as the Being of God is ſelf-exiſtent, and therefore unlimited, ſo his Perfections are infinite.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. The Excellencies of created Spirits are <hi>dependant</hi> &amp; alterable, becauſe deriv'd from another, they muſt depend on him who form'd them. Angels themſelves, who are the nobleſt of created Spirits, inaſmuch as they once were not, are capable of returning to their former Nonentity: They are alſo capable of the Impreſſions of Happineſs and Miſery; ſome of them have fallen from their original State of Holineſs &amp; Happineſs; but none of theſe Things are applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, he is far from the Shadow of Change, an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant God. Who tho' he is happy, can neither be made happy or miſerable. He only hath immortality.</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. Angels are <hi>under</hi> the <hi>Dominion</hi> of God, they muſt needs owe Subjection and Homage to him, who gave them their Exiſtence. And this their very Name <hi>Angel</hi> or <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger</hi> imports. But it is the unalienable and incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Prerogative of <hi>Jehovah</hi> alone to be ſupream and above all Control.</p>
            <p>But I proceed to the 4th general Head which was to open the Nature of that ſpiritual Worſhip, which we ought to perform to that God, <hi>who is a Spirit,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. It imply's <hi>ſpiritual Principles, viz. Experimental Knowledge</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>our Selves,</hi> ſuch as affects and humbles us, and makes us judge our ſelves, with holy <hi>Paul,</hi> to be <hi>leſs than the Leaſt of all Saints. Without Knowledge,</hi> ſays <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, the Mind cannot be good.</hi> And Indeed we cannot love rationally without ſome Knowledge of the Object we love.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. Another <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>ſpiritual Worſhip,</hi> is <hi>Love,</hi> tranſcendent Love to God in CHRIST, becauſe of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel'd and inexpreſſible Excellency, whereby we chooſe
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:005500_0159_10396508D7E7D7B0"/>
God as the only Portion of our Souls, and his Worſhip as our moſt agreeable Entertainment. (<hi>Joſ.</hi> xxiv. 15.)</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. Another Principle of <hi>ſpiritual Worſhip</hi> is <hi>Faith</hi> in the eternal God, Father, Son and Spirit, even ſuch <hi>Faith</hi> as renews the Heart, and reforms the Practice: For he that comes to God muſt <hi>believe that he is, and that he is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder of thoſe that unfeignedly ſeek him,</hi> But</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. <hi>Spiritual Worſhip</hi> implies a <hi>ſpiritual End,</hi> not our own Credit or worldly Intereſt, with the Phariſees of Old; but God's Glory, and in Subordination thereto, our own and our Neighbours Spiritual Good and Edification. This is to ſerve God with our Spirits, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſes it (<hi>Rom.</hi> i. 9.) If we ſhould refer all our natural and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil Actions to the Glory of God, how much more our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious? <hi>Whether in eating or drinking, or whatſoever we do we ſhould do it all to the Glory of God.</hi> See <hi>Col.</hi> iii. 22, 23. <hi>Not with Eye Service, ſuch as Men Pleaſers, but in ſingleneſs o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Heart fearing God. And whatſoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not unto Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3dly. <hi>Spiritual Worſhip,</hi> implies a <hi>ſpiritual Rule,</hi> not the Cuſtoms of the Age we live in, or the Inventions or Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Men, but the written Word of God, this is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>to make the Man of God Perfect, and thoroughly furniſhed to every good Work.</hi> To thoſe that walk according to this Rule, <hi>Peace be on them and on Iſrael of God. To the Law and to the Teſtimony, if they ſpeak not according to this Word, it is becauſe there is no Light in them.</hi> Iſa. viii. 20. As God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knows what Worſhip will be acceptable to him, ſo he only has a Right to preſcribe Acts of Worſhip, being the Creator and Lord of all, and therefore when Men add to the divine Inſtitutions, as they abridge their fellow Creatures of the Liberty God has graciouſly given them, ſo they u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurp the divine Prerogative, and injuriouſly reflect upon the
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:005500_0160_10396507268D6280"/>
Wiſdom and Fidelity of the great Legiſlator. Our Lord charged the Phariſees, with <hi>vain Worſhip</hi> becauſe they taught for Doctrines <hi>the Commandments of Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4thly. Spiritual Worſhip, implies a <hi>ſpiritual Manner</hi> of <hi>Performance,</hi> And this is when the Heart joyns with the outward Man in God's Service, when we do it out of Choice. (<hi>Joſh.</hi> vxiv. 15.) <hi>When we long for an abſent God, Pſ.</hi> xlii. 1. When we heartily lament his Abſence, with <hi>Job. O that I knew where I could find him!</hi> When we <hi>rejoyce</hi> in his Preſence! (<hi>Phil.</hi> iii. 3.) When under a Senſe of our Inability to perform Duty aright, without the Help of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit thro' CHRIST, and our Unworthineſs of that Help, we rely upon the Lord JESUS for Strength. Thus the Spouſe is ſaid <hi>to come out of the Wilderneſs, leaning on her Beloved.</hi> But I proceed to the Improvement of this Subject. And</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. From the ſpirituality of God, or from his Being a Spirit, we may infer his <hi>Simplicity.</hi> A Spirit, as all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, is an immaterial Being, and therefore a ſimple one. If it be objected, that Angels and the Souls of Men are called Spirits in Scripture, and yet they are not altogether ſimple. <hi>Anſ.</hi> They are ſo only in a diminitive Senſe, by Way of analogy, becauſe they come neareſt of all to the Spirituality of God. But God himſelf is moſt properly &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly a Spirit. The Holy Scriptures teach this <hi>Simplicity</hi> of God, ſo often as it repreſents him not in compounded or in concrete Terms, but in ſimple and abſtract ones. <hi>e. g.</hi> When he is therein call'd <hi>Love.</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> iv. 8. <hi>He that Loveth not, knoweth not God, for God is Love.</hi> 2dly. God is call'd <hi>Life.</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> v. 20. <hi>This is the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e God and eternal Life.</hi> 3dly He is ſaid to be <hi>Light in which there is no Darkneſs at all,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> i. 5. <hi>i. e.</hi> His Godhead has nothing of a different kind, which is not pure Godhead.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="158" facs="unknown:005500_0161_1039650569D0CDB0"/>And indeed the Simplicity of God, follows neceſſarily from many other of God's Perfections. e. g. 1ſt. From his <hi>Self-Exiſtence,</hi> by which he is abſolutely the firſt Being, if by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition there were different Things in God, then there would be many firſt Things, of which none would be abſolutely the firſt, becauſe not before the Parts join'd with it: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over if God were compounded, there muſt be one to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound him, who muſt exiſt before the firſt, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. And 2dly, The Simplicity of God follows from his Independency: For on the contrary, what is compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cannot be Independent, for then the whole depends upon the compoſing Parts, and the Union of thoſe Parts depends upon the Compoſer. 3dly, God is immutable and therefore a ſimple Being, for whatſoever is compounded, is liable to be diſolv'd into the Parts of which the Compoſition is made, and thus it is changeable. 4thly. The <hi>Eternity of God</hi> proves him to be a <hi>ſimple Being,</hi> for whatſoever has had a Beginning may have an End! To this we may farther add, his <hi>Infinity</hi> and <hi>Perfections.</hi> And 1ſt. If God be <hi>Infinite,</hi> as the Scriptures aſſerts when it informs us, <hi>That he fills the Heaven and Earth, and that the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain him,</hi> than he is a ſimple Being: For whatſoever is compounded is finite, the Parts compoſing muſt needs be finite, becauſe they are leſs than the Whole. And it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for a Number of finite Parts to produce Infinity. 2dly. If God be a moſt <hi>Perfect Being</hi> as the Scripture aſſerts Mat. v. 48. <hi>Be Perfect as your Heavenly Father is Perfect,</hi> then he is a ſimple one. Becauſe not only all Men acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that it is more Perfect to be Wiſdom itſelf, than to be Wiſe, to be Goodneſs it ſelf, than to be Good: But alſo the Notion of a Part involves a manifold Imperfection, inaſmuch as it has not the Perfection of the Whole, and pre-requires a Compoſer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="159" facs="unknown:005500_0162_1039650302D5EBF0"/>Now the <hi>Simplicity of God</hi> is a <hi>divine Property whereby he is void of all Compoſition, Mixture and Diviſion, being all Eſſence, ſo that whatſoever is in God, is God.</hi> The Almighty by his <hi>Simplicity</hi> is free from all Kinds of Compoſition, by which different Things unite. As particularly,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. From a Compoſition of <hi>quantitative</hi> or <hi>bulky Parts</hi> which belongs to Bodies; but God is a Spirit, as has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made evident.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, Of <hi>eſſential Parts,</hi> ſuch as Matter and Form, theſe belong only to Bodies, but God is immaterial.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, Of <hi>Subſtance</hi> and <hi>Accident.</hi> Seeing that all Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents are judg'd more imperfect than the Subſtances to which they belong, and are liable to change, as Whiteneſs in the Wall, they are therefore inconſiſtent with the divine Perfection.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. Of <hi>Eſſence</hi> and <hi>Exiſtence,</hi> ſeeing that <hi>Exiſtence</hi> is but an Act of the <hi>Eſſence,</hi> and nothing different from it, which might infer a Compoſition.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. Of <hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Difference,</hi> which every Species contains: God is a Being above Being, in nothing he agrees with others, but in all Things he differs from all. But on the Contrary, every Creature is ſubject to Compoſition, and conſequently to Diviſion. All Things which are created, are made by joining together into one, more Things than one, and ſo they conſiſt of divers Things. Some have a more groſs Compoſition of Parts, both Eſſential and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gral. As a Man, of Soul and Body; and the Body of Fleſh, Blood and Bones. Some have a finer Compoſition, <hi>e. g.</hi> an Angel is compounded of <hi>Subſtance</hi> and <hi>Accidents</hi> that cleave thereto. His Subſtance or Eſſence, his Faculties and Qualities are different Things. His Life is one Thing; his Will, Power, Wiſdom, Agility, or Nimbleneſs other Things. And the ſame may be ſaid of his Goodneſs, which
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:005500_0163_10396501586DF3B8"/>
the Scriptures inform us, ſome Angels have loſt and yet retain their Beings. And thus the Soul of Man and all other Creatures are made up of many Things joined together.</p>
            <p>But God is abſolutely <hi>Simple,</hi> without Parts or Accidents; his Eſſence and Attributes are all one Thing in him, tho' differently conceiv'd of by us! But here let it be carefully obſerved, that <hi>Simplicity,</hi> as it is oppos'd to <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> which is ſometimes the Senſe of the Word in Scripture (<hi>Pro.</hi> i. 22.) cannot without the greateſt Blaſphemy be aſcrib'd to God. It is therefore <hi>Simplicity</hi> only, as it is <hi>oppos'd</hi> to <hi>Mixture</hi> and <hi>Compoſition,</hi> that is to be aſcrib'd to God.
<q>That is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called <hi>Simple (ſays</hi> Zanchy) which is not compoſed of different Things. And by how much the leſs any Thing is compounded, ſo much the more Simple it is, and is call'd.</q> But</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. Is God a <hi>Spirit?</hi> Then we ſhould frame no reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of him in our Thoughts as tho' he were a material Being or had a Body! And far leſs ſhould we form Pictures and Images of God, either for Decency or Devotion. It is Folly with a Witneſs to pretend to draw the Lineaments or Form of an immaterial and inviſible Being. And indeed it is an idolatrous Practice, which the Almighty ſtrictly caution'd the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> againſt, Deut. vi. 12, 15, 16. <hi>And the Lord ſpake unto you out of the midſt of the Fire, ye heard the Voice of the Words but ſaw no ſimilitude; take therefore good Heed unto yourſelves, for ye ſaw no manner of Similitude in</hi> Horeb, <hi>leſt ye corrupt yourſelves and make you a graven Image, the Similitude of any Figure, the likeneſs of Male or Female.</hi> But</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. Is God a <hi>Spirit?</hi> Then he is the moſt ſuitable Good to our Souls, which are Spirits. As he is a ſpiritual Being, he ſuits their Nature and can communicate himſelf to them, And as he is All-ſufficient, he can fully ſatisfy their moſt
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:005500_0164_103964FFB79EEFF8"/>
extenſive Deſires. But on the Contrary, tho' earthly Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments may gratify our ſenſual Appeties, yet, becauſe of their groſs and elementary Nature, they cannot ſatisfy, and do not ſuit our Souls, neither in reſpect of their Nature and Dignity, or their Deſires and Duration. It was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore exceeding fooliſh in the rich Man to ſay to his Soul, in reſpect of ſuch Things, <hi>that it had much Goods laid up for many Years.</hi> Such Entertainments can no more ſatisfy the anxious Soul, than Huſks, Gravel-Stones, or the Eaſt Wind can ſatisfy the cravings of our Stomach! And it is with great Juſtice that the Scriptures aſcribe ſuch ignominious Epithets to all <hi>earthly Good,</hi> to ſignify in the ſtrongeſt Terms its inſufficiency to content the Mind.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. Is God a <hi>Spirit?</hi> This ſhews us then the ne-neceſſity of Spiritual Worſhip. This indeed is plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd in our Text. Such a Worſhip is ſuitable to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, and will be only accepted by him. The juſtneſs of this inference ſome of the Pagans diſcovered by the Dint of Natures Light. <hi>Cato</hi> ſpeaks excellently about it in his Diſticks, in the following Manner.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Sideus eſtanimus nobis ut carmina dicunt.</l>
               <l>Hic tibi precipue ſit pura mente colendus, i. e.</l>
            </q>
            <p>If God is a Spirit, as the Poets inform us, then our cheif Care, ſhould be to worſhip him with a pure Mind.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing this ſpiritual Worſhip is the Touch-Stone of true Chriſtianity, we ſhould be hereby enduced to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine ourſelves with all Speed and Seriouſneſs, whether we perform it or not, and that by an impartial and deliberate Application of what has been ſaid concerning it, in the doctrinal Part of this Diſcourſe. Now if upon Tryal we find the aforeſaid Characters of ſpiritual Worſhip in us, we may and ought to rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus, notwithſtanding our many defects, becauſe we are compleat in him. Sincere Intentions are accepted for Performances, eſpecially when an
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:005500_0165_103964FE0FD43348"/>
opportunity for Action does not preſent it ſelf. Thus it was in <hi>David</hi>'s Caſe, altho' he did not actually build the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, yet becauſe he honeſtly purpoſed to do it, the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty look'd upon it as done.</p>
            <p>But ſuch as are deſtitute of the aforeſaid Characters who worſhip God who is a Spirit, without Spirit; who draw near to God with their Lips, while their Hearts are far from him; who reſt in a dead Form of Devotion; who content themſelves with bodily Exerciſe, which profits little, and in the mean Time with their Minds ſerve themſelves, all ſuch are in a doleful Caſe, their ſpecious Worſhip being deſtitute of Spirit and Soul, is dead, and ſtinks before God as a dead Corps that is putrify'd does in our Noſtrils! Such Services <hi>Jehovah caſts as Dung upon their Faces, Mal.</hi> 23. Such in the Judgment of God are Hypocrits, and ſuch he pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces a Woe upon, <hi>Mat.</hi> xxiii. 25, 26. <hi>Wo unto you Scribes and Phariſees, Hypocrits, for ye make clean the out ſide of the Cup and Platter, but within they are full of Extortion and Exceſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5thly, Is God a Spirit? Then let us purify our Spirits or Hearts more and more from all ſpiritual Wickedneſs, and devote them to God. Now the Deſires or luſts of the Mind, which War againſt it, and ought to be purged away, are theſe, viz. <hi>Ignorance, ſpiritual Blindneſs, Pride, Infidelity, Hypocriſy.</hi> We ſhould be enduced to oppoſe ſpiritual Evils by the following Conſiderations, 1ſt. Becauſe they make us moſt like the Devils, who are ſpiritual Wickedneſſes.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. Becauſe Sin is ſtrongeſt in the Spirit, as its Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, Becauſe God who is a Spirit, as he is pleaſed with ſpiritual Services, ſo he is principally offended with ſpiritual Abominations! Beſides, thoſe Evils are eſpecially contrary to the Perfection of the ſpiritual Law of God. Now we ſhould

endeavour to purge our Hearts from the aforeſaid Evils, by Watchfulneſs in oppoſing the firſt evil Motions, by medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the divine Word, by repeated Acts of Faith upon CHRIST, and by earneſt Prayer. And we ſhould be incited to give our <hi>Hearts</hi> and our <hi>Spirits</hi> to God by conſidering 1ſt. That he requires it, <hi>my Son give me thine Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly, He has the beſt Right to it, for he has made it, he is the Father of Spirits.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, He beſt deſerves it alſo in Point of Gratitude, on Account of his preſerving, providing, and redeeming Love.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly, It ought to be given to him alſo in point of Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, for he can only ſatisfy it with ſuitable and enduring Good! Let us there commit our Spirits into his Hands, that he may <hi>iuſtify</hi> them by the Blood and Obedience of his Son, and <hi>ſanctify</hi> them by his Spirit, and at laſt receive them into his Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Is God a ſimple Being? Then let us glorify him upon the Account of this Attribute, by which he is ſo much exalted above all changeable and Compounded Beings! and let us with ſimplicity entirely depend upon him in all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity! He is <hi>Light</hi> to direct us, <hi>Power</hi> to ſupport us, <hi>Love</hi> to refreſh us, yea he is our <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Salvation!</hi> His ſimplicity makes him an Object worthy of Truſt and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, for he will not deceive the Expectations of the Poor. And ſhould not we Endeavour to imitate the Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of God in Heart and Converſation? Let us ſerve God, not with a double Heart, as Hypocrits, who look two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Ways; but with Simplicity, which includes theſe Things in it, viz. <hi>Purity, Sincerity,</hi> and <hi>Conſtancy.</hi> 1ſt. With <hi>Purity</hi> of Heart, Hence our Saviour pronounces a bleſſing upon thoſe <hi>who are pure in Heart, i. e.</hi> Who love, long for,

and labour after <hi>Holineſs</hi> in Heart, and do not habitually indulge the Contrary!</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, <hi>Sincerity,</hi> and that is when a Perſon by one direct Line, aims at God's glory in the general Courſe of all their Actions, <hi>Natural, Civil,</hi> and eſpecially <hi>Religious.</hi> Hence our Lord informs us, that <hi>if our Eye be ſingle our whole Body is full of Light,</hi> Mat. vi. 22.

            <p>THIS Text repreſents to us the Infinity of God's Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence or Being, and the Neceſſity of Honouring him on this Account. And 1ſt. we have a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the Infinity of the divine Being, more generally in theſe Words, <hi>great is the Lord</hi> or <hi>Jehovah.</hi> Here God, denominated by his Eſſence, is ſaid to be great: For the Name <hi>Jehovah</hi> intends his Eſſence or Being, that thus we might know his Eſſence is Infinite. The Word <hi>great</hi> muſt either refer to Quantity or Quality, if to Quantity, then either to Number or Magnitude; in reſpect of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber God is one, but ſo one, as eminently to include yea ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed all! In reſpect of Magnitude, God is great without Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, as he is good without Quality, <hi>i. e.</hi> As his Goodneſs is not any Thing added to his Being, as it is in Creatures; but is the ſame with it, ſo his Greatneſs does not conſiſt in the Bulk or Dimenſions of Bodys, ſuch as Heigth, Depth, Breadth, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But if the Word <hi>great,</hi> be apply'd to Quality, then it denotes the Excellency of a Thing or Perſon, together with an eminent Degree of that Excellency. And thus it is
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:005500_0169_103964F770FBBFC8"/>
with God, he exceeds all others in Excellency; but we have in the Words of our Text, a more Particular Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Infinity of the divine Being, in theſe Words. <hi>And his Greatneſs is unſearchable,</hi> or as the Words are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted by others, <hi>has no End,</hi> as that which is finite may be ſearched, ſo on the contrary that which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable muſt needs be Infinite, <hi>Job.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Which doth great Things and unſearchable, marvellous Things without Number.</hi> Rom. xi. 33. <hi>O the Depth of the Riches, both of the Wiſdom and Knowledge of God, how unſearchable ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Not only above Emperors, Kings, Princes and Magiſtrates, who are call'd Gods, becauſe they bear ſome Image of the divine Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, by their Superiority and Power of Government; <hi>but alſo above all</hi> falſe <hi>Gods,</hi> who are great in the Opinion of their Worſhippers. The Number of which in the Time of <hi>Heſiod,</hi> was above Thirty Thouſand, to every of which was aſſign'd ſome peculiar Perfection; without doubt then, he who is greater than all thoſe muſt needs be infinite, and ought to be praiſed as ſuch; which is the 2d.

                  <item>I. Endeavour to prove that God is infinite in his Eſſence.</item>
                  <item>II. Labour to explain the Nature thereof, And</item>
                  <item>III. Speak of his <hi>Immenſity</hi> or <hi>Omnipreſence,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults therefrom, and ſo proceed to the Improvement. And</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. The Scriptures aſſert the <hi>Infinity</hi> of God's <hi>Eſſence,</hi> not only in thoſe Places already mentioned, but alſo in theſe following <hi>viz. Job</hi> xxxvi. 26. <hi>Behold God is great, and we know him not, neither can the Number of his Years be ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out,</hi> Job. xi. 7, 8, 9. <hi>Canſt thou by ſearching find out God, canſt thou find out the Almighty unto Perfection, it is high as Heaven, what canſt thou do, deeper than Hell what canſt thou know? The Meaſure thereof is longer than the Earth, and broader than the Sea.</hi> And Reaſon alſo confirms the ſame Truth, as appears by the following Particulars, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. If God's Being and Perfections are incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as has been prov'd in this, and in a preceeding Sermon, then certainly they are infinite. The great Reaſon why Men and Angels cannot graſp the Knowledge of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Being is, becauſe it is too vaſt an Object for their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Capacities to compaſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. There is nothing in Creatures that argues an End or Defect, either in their Being, Power, Preſence, or Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for which they are call'd finite, which is not very alien or remote from God, and therefore he is Infinite.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. He created the World out of nothing, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd infinite Power, becauſe of an infinite Diſtance which was to be overcome, between nothing and ſomething.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. Seeing the higheſt Perfection, is neceſſarily includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Notion of a God, and this the Scriptures confirm, by calling him <hi>the moſt High,</hi> Pſal. xviii. 13. Then his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Attributes are Infinite: For ſomething higher and
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:005500_0171_103964F34E61C340"/>
more excellent than finite may be conceiv'd, <hi>viz.</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is Infinite. And</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. Seeing he is abſolutely the firſt Being he muſt of Neceſſity be Infinite, for thus there can be none before him, to limit his Being and Perfections. If his Being had any Bounds, it could not be abſolute. The Reaſon why Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are finite is, becauſe they are made by another, who has circumſcrib'd their Beings within certain Limits. Now that God is abſolutely the firſt Being, exiſting of himſelf, has been already prov'd in a preceeding Sermon.</p>
            <p n="6">6thly. Foraſmuch as all the various Perfections of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, both Angelical and Human in Heaven and Earth, are borrow'd from God. He who is the unexhauſted Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, from which they all flow, muſt be Immenſe and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite: For ſurely the Giver muſt be greater than the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Hence is that notable Scripture. <hi>Rom.</hi> xi. 35, 36. <hi>Who hath firſt given to him and it ſhall be recompenſed unto him again, for of him, and thro' him, and to him are all Things.</hi> I proceed to conſider the</p>
            <p n="2">2d. Propos'd which was to explain <hi>the Nature of God's Infinity, eſpecially in his Eſſence;</hi> which may be thus deſcrib'd, <hi>viz. That it is an incommunicable Property of</hi> Jehovah, <hi>whereby he is without all Bounds and Limitations in his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Perfections.</hi> The Infinity of God may be ſaid to reſpect, either his Attributes or his Being; as it reſpects his Attributes, thus his Juſtice, Power, Wiſdom, Holineſs, Grace, Mercy, and Duration, are ſaid to be Infinite in Scripture, that is without Bounds, Limits, or End. As it reſpects his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it ſignifies that it neither is, or can be bounded, neither outwardly by an encompaſſing Body, as material Things are, nor inwardly, by proper Limits, as created Spirits. All Creatures both Human and Angelical, as well as others are
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:005500_0172_103964F1C7416C00"/>
bounded by their Eſſences, the Form acting upon the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter limits it within its own Confines. But God is unlimited, and can't be <hi>ſearched out to Perfection. Job.</hi> xi. 7. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this is applicable to all that can be ſaid of him! Hence ſays the Pſalmiſt <hi>his underſtanding is infinite.</hi> And indeed infinity is the peculiar Glory of God, whereby he is diſtinguiſh'd from and far advanced above all ſecondary Beings.</p>
            <p>God is infinite not according to the Etimology of the Word, which reſpects an End only, for he is without Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and End. <hi>Zanchy</hi> obſerves,
<q>That a Thing is call'd <hi>privativly</hi> Infinite, which indeed hath not an End, but can have it. This is applicable to the nobleſt Creatures even to Angels and the Souls of Men.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And <hi>2dly.</hi> That that is <hi>negatively</hi> infinite, which neither has nor can have any End.</q> In this Senſe God only is infinite, yet when we ſay that God is negatively infinite, a poſitive Perfection is thereby intended.
<q>
                  <hi>Infinity</hi> (ſaith <hi>Gomarus</hi>) is an abſolute property of the Eſſence of God, which is not limitted or circumſcrib'd by any Terms, or Bounds of Cauſe or Meaſure.</q> To explain this, let it be obſerv'd, that every Creature hath a fourfold Limitation, <hi>viz.</hi> Of the <hi>Kind</hi> of <hi>Being, Degrees</hi> of Being, of <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And. 1ſt. Creatures are limitted as to their <hi>Kinds</hi> of <hi>Being,</hi> ſome are of one Kind, and ſome of another ſome are ſimple, ſome compounded, ſome have Bodies, ſome not, ſome have Life, ſome none, ſome have Senſe ſome none. The great Creator hath fix'd them in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Kinds and Orders, that ſo the whole Frame of Things may be beautify'd with variety. But God himſelf is not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to any kind of Being. He hath in himſelf all Kinds, not ſubjectively, but eminently.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. Creatures are limited to <hi>Degrees</hi> of <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> or Excellency, ſome have higher and ſome lower
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:005500_0173_103964F020930CE0"/>
Degrees, but the Being of God is abſolute perfect and infinite and ſo beyond all Degrees and Meaſures; and thus are all his Attributes which ſpring from his Being, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly differ there from in our Manner of conceiving.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly Creatures are limited as to <hi>Time</hi> or <hi>Duration</hi> they have a Beginning either with or in Time, and a Succeſſion in Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and either have or may have an End. But God is Eternal an Everlaſting Now, without Beginning, Succeſſion, or End.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. Creatures are limitted as to <hi>Place,</hi> they are includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a Place, and cannot be every where at once, but God is Immenſe and Omnipreſent. And thus I am led to ſpeak upon the</p>
            <p n="3">3d, Propos'd, viz. the <hi>Immenſity</hi> and <hi>Omnipreſence</hi> of God. Theſe Words repreſent the ſame Thing after a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Manner. <hi>Infinity,</hi> as it cannot be meaſured by Place, or any other Dimenſions of Length, Breadth, Depth, Height, is call'd <hi>Immenſity.</hi> As it exſiſts with every Creature, it is call'd <hi>Omnipreſence;</hi> and as it co-exiſts every where, it is call'd <hi>Ubiquity.</hi> This Attribute of God may be thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd, viz. <hi>That it is the Infinity of the divine. Eſſence, as that exiſts with all Space.</hi> By <hi>Space,</hi> we are to underſtand nothing more than where a Creature does or may exiſt, and therefore it is two Fold, viz. 1ſt. either a vacuum or void, where a Creature can exiſt, or a Place where it actually does exiſt. Therefore Space is properly no Being, much leſs a Body, for then when a Body is in a Place, one Body would be in another. Neither is it the ſame with a Body which is contain'd in a Place, for when a Body is remov'd the Place containing remain's. Neither are Breadth and Length, and other ſuch like Dimenſions, properly in Space; but in the Bodies which are or may be contain'd therein. Now the Almighty is not extended together with Space, or diffus'd thro' it, for theſe Things only belong to Bodies. <hi>Jehovah</hi>
               <pb n="171" facs="unknown:005500_0174_103964EE589F3900"/>
being without Matter or Parts, muſt be without Extenſion; and having no Matter he can have no Form, which belongs to Matter, and gives it the Dimenſions of Weadth and Length, &amp;c. The Almighty only exiſts together with all Space, not by Multiplication of himſelf, for he is one; nor by Diviſion by Parts, being partly in Heaven and partly on Earth, for he is moſt <hi>Simple</hi> and cannot be divided: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the Almighty be circumſcrib'd or bounded by Space, becauſe he is a Spirit; or limitted to a certain Place, becauſe he is Infinite. God exiſts with all Space by filling of it. Jer. xxiii. 24. <hi>Do not I fill Heaven and Earth, ſayeth the Lord.</hi> The Almighty indeed does not fill Space as Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies do, becauſe his Being there does not exclude the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Whereas two Bodies cannot occupy the ſame Place in the ſame Inſtant of Time. But <hi>Jehovah</hi> fills all Places in the following reſpects.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. So as not to be <hi>included</hi> in any <hi>Place</hi> or encompaſſed, for then he muſt be finite: <hi>But the Heaven of Heavens can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not contain him.</hi> And</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, So as not to be <hi>excluded</hi> out of any <hi>Place;</hi> and hence it is ſaid, Act. xvii. 27. <hi>That he is not far from every one of us.</hi> Even the Heathens, by the Light of Nature, could ſay,
<q>Jovis omnia plena; all Things are full of <hi>Jupiter.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3dly, So as to be <hi>without Motion from Place to Place:</hi> And therefore, when the Scriptures ſpeak of his <hi>deſcending from Heaven to Earth, his riding on a Cherub, and on the Wings of the Wind,</hi> it is only a form of Speech accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to our weak Way of conceiving of God and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Things, importing ſome ſpecial Manifeſtation of God in his Works of Providence.

            <p>The Holy Scriptures aſſert in ſtrong Terms, the <hi>Omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> of God, <hi>Pſa.</hi> cxxxix. from the 7th to the 10th Verſes, <hi>Whether ſhall I go from thy Spirit, or whither ſhall I flee from thy Preſence? If I aſſend up into Heaven, thou art there, If I make my Bed in Hell, behold thou art there. If I take the Wings of the Morning and dwell in the uttermoſt Parts of the Sea, even there ſhall thy Hand lead me, and thy right Hand ſhall hold me.</hi> Act. xvii. 28. <hi>For in him we live and move and have our Being.</hi> And indeed the <hi>Omnipreſence</hi> of God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follows from his <hi>Infinity,</hi> which we have before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered: For what is Infinite in Eſſence, cannot be reſtricted to any Place. It is contradictory to ſuppoſe that that which is boundleſs, ſhould be bounded; it is juſt in other Words to ſay, that that which hath no limits, nor poſſibly can have them, yet that it hath them; which is abſurd!</p>
            <p>Beſides, to be reſtrained by any to a Place, is as incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the <hi>Independency</hi> of God, as Motion from Place to Place is with his immutability or unchangableneſs!</p>
            <p>It likewiſe follows from the Almightyneſs of God, that he can Work every where, which could not be if he were limited to any Place.</p>
            <p>And how can we ſuppoſe, that a perfect Being, who is poſſeſs'd with all Perfection, can want that of Omnipreſence, without a manifeſt Contradiction? And that the various Perfections of God admit of no Degrees or Meaſures, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows neceſſarily from his <hi>Simplicity.</hi> Compounded Beings admit of Degrees and Dimenſions, but ſuch as are Simple, have none: Sweet Things have their Degrees, but Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs itſelf is above all Degrees!</p>

               <pb n="173" facs="unknown:005500_0176_103964EAF28A2028"/>But before I proceed to the Improvement of this Subject, I would have it obſerv'd, that altho' the <hi>Immenſity</hi> and <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipreſence</hi> of God, does in the firſt place, concern his Eſſence, yet that it doth alſo reſpect his <hi>Knowledge,</hi> his <hi>Operations,</hi> his <hi>Providence,</hi> by his <hi>Eſſence.</hi> Hence all Things are ſaid <hi>to be naked and open unto the Eyes of him with whom we have to do,</hi> Heb. iv. 13. And hence God is ſaid <hi>to uphold all Things by the Word of his Power,</hi> Heb. i. 3. Now in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of God's <hi>Operations,</hi> he is ſaid to be variouſly preſent with Creatures.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt In <hi>Heaven,</hi> he is preſent by his <hi>Glory:</hi> There he makes his divine Majeſty and Glory, peculiarly manifeſt to the equal Admiration and Delight of Saints and Angels! Hence that bleſſed Place is call'd <hi>the Throne of God,</hi> Iſa. lxvi. 1. And <hi>his dwelling Place,</hi> 2 Chron. vi. 21.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. On <hi>Earth,</hi> God is preſent by his Grace, enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, adopting, ſanctifying and comforting his People; hence the Spirit is promis'd for theſe Ends, <hi>Joh.</hi> xvi. 8.9.</p>

Good. I proceed to the Improvement of this Subject. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. The ſerious Conſideration of the Greatneſs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity of God, compar'd with the Nothingneſs of Mankind, may juſtly make us aſham'd of our Pride, and humble us before him! With what becoming abaſedneſs did <hi>Abram</hi> of old ſpeak to God upon this Account, Gen. xviii. 27. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold now I have taken upon me to ſpeak to the Lord, who am but Duſt and Aſhes!</hi> And do not the Angels, thoſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the Court of Heaven, for the very ſame Reaſon <hi>vail their Faces before him,</hi> Iſa. vi. God is Infinite in his Being and all his Attributes; and what are we but <hi>Shadows, Worms, Locuſts, drops in the Bucket, a little Duſt in the Balance,</hi> yea as <hi>Nothing</hi> and <hi>leſs</hi> than <hi>Nothing.</hi> For what Proportion is there between what is finite and infinity? How juſtly may we therefore uſe the <hi>Pſalmiſts</hi> Exclamation, Pſal. viii. 4. <hi>What is Man that thou art mindful of him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly, The Conſideration of the Infinity of God, ſhould incline us to Modeſty in our Thoughts of divine Myſteries, ſuch as the ſacred Trinity, the hypoſtatical Union of two Natures in the Perſon of Chriſt, and any other Difficulties we meet with in Scripture, to which our weak Underſtandings are not equal. In this Caſe it would be of excellent Uſe, humbly to call to Mind the Words of our Text, <hi>Great is the Lord and greatly to be praiſed, his Greatneſs is unſearcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> As well as the ſaying of <hi>Zophar,</hi> Job xi. <hi>Canſt thou by ſearching find out God, canſt thou know the Almighty to Perfection, it's higher than Heaven, what canſt thou do?</hi>

Who would not then make choice of ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a Being, for his Portion and Inheritance? For ſurely as the Pſalmiſt obſerves, <hi>Happy is the People who are in ſuch a Caſe, yea Happy is that People whoſe God is the Lord, Pſa.</hi> cxliv. ult. The Excellency's of poor Creatures are variable and limitted, and while here, ſtain'd with many Defects and Blemiſhes, they often deceive our Expectation! Hence the Perſon is curs'd <hi>who truſteth in Man, or maketh Fleſh his Arm!</hi> Sometimes they cannot, and ſometimes they will not help us in extremity. Let us therefore diſclaim all Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on them, all immoderate Love to them, and make the infinite <hi>Jehovah</hi> the only Foundation of our Religious Truſt, the only Object of our tranſcendent Reſpect and Love! But</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. Is <hi>Jehovah</hi> great? <hi>Then he is greatly to be prais'd,</hi> this is the <hi>Pſalmiſt's</hi> inference in our Text. If it be proper to make Panegyricks or commendatory Orations in the Praiſe of temporal Princes, on the Account of their Greatneſs, how much more ſo muſt it be to praiſe the <hi>King of Kings and Lord of Lords!</hi> He, and He only, is abſolutely great! <hi>Great</hi> of <hi>himſelf, independently Great, invariably Great:</hi> As his Greatneſs depends upon none, ſo it is Subject to no Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Likewiſe the Almighty is <hi>comparetivly</hi> and <hi>ſuperla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively Great:</hi> Great above all Gods, yea <hi>infinitely</hi> and <hi>inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſſibly Great; Great</hi> without <hi>Bounds,</hi> and <hi>beyond all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and Conception.</hi> Whereas the greatneſs of the moſt puiſſant Monarchs on Earth, is <hi>deriv'd, dependent, variable,</hi> and <hi>finite.</hi> Now we ſhould Praiſe the great God, 1ſt. In our <hi>Hearts,</hi> by thinking great Things of him, yea the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:005500_0179_103964E6451F8DD0"/>
ſeeing <hi>Jehovah</hi> tranſcends the higheſt flight of an Angels Thought; by a <hi>great Eſteem</hi> of him above all others and of his Preſence, Love, Promiſes, Worſhip. By a great and inſatiable <hi>Deſire</hi> after a Senſe of his Love, and conformity to his Nature, as well as after the Manifeſtation of his Glory and the Promotion of his Kingdom, Pſal. lxxxiv. 1, 2. <hi>How amiable are thy Tabernacles O Lord of Hoſts! My Soul long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, yea even fainteth for the Courts of the Lord, and my Fleſh cryeth out for the living God!</hi> And farther we ſhould Praiſe God in our Hearts, by <hi>Delight</hi> and <hi>Complacency</hi> in him, and in all his Ways of dealing towards us, as well as by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting to receive great Things from a great God! How condeſcending and amazing is that Place of Scripture men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by the Royal Prophet Iſa. xlv. 11. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord the Holy one of Iſrael, aſk me of things to come con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning my Sons, and concerning the Work of my Hands, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ye me. Jehovah</hi> delights to manifeſt the dazling Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his Greatneſs and Infinity, in compaſſing great Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for his People! And therefore as we may freely aſk great Mercy's from God, ſo we may ſafely expect them! For who can control Omnipotence, or ſet bounds to <hi>Infinity?</hi> and therefore when in our thoughts, we Queſtion his Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs, we turn back from God and tempt him, and limit the holy one of Iſrael, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.41.)</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, We ſhould praiſe God with our <hi>Lips,</hi> by decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring among others with a loud Voice, his infinite Greatneſs and Excellency, and exciting others to do the ſame, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> ciii. 8, 20, 21.) And,</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, We ſhould praiſe the great God by our <hi>Lives;</hi> by a profound Reverence of his Majeſty, and fear of offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, even in the ſmalleſt Things, by an earneſt Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to obey and pleaſe him, and by an infinite deſire, and ſteady Care to enjoy him here and forever! But,</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="177" facs="unknown:005500_0180_103964E49DF5E430"/>5thly, Is <hi>Jehovah</hi> Infinite? Then we may hence learn the dangerous Caſe of thoſe who ſlight God; but who are they, and what is their Miſery?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1ſt. All ſuch as ſay in the Pride of their Hearts with <hi>Pharaoh, who is the Lord that I ſhould obey him?</hi> Ex. ii. Or like thoſe whom <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks of, Job xxi. 14. <hi>They ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, depart from us, for we deſire not the Knowledge of thy Ways; what is the Almighty that we ſhould ſerve him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly, All ſuch as abuſe the Kindneſs and Long-ſuffering of God. Rom. ii. 4, 5. <hi>Or deſpiſeſt thou the Riches of his Goodneſs and Forbearance, not knowing that the Goodneſs of God leadeth to repentance, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p n="3">3dly, Thoſe ſlight <hi>Jehovah,</hi> who ſlight his Embaſſadors, (<hi>Luke</hi> x. 16.) And</p>

How can they endure his infinite Wrath, and which Way can they eſcape it? Not by Craft, for he is infinite in Wiſdom and Knowledge; not by Might, for he is infinite in Power. When he <hi>but touches the Mountains they ſmoke, yea the Hills tremble at his Preſence!</hi> Not by <hi>Flight,</hi> for he is every where Preſent. <hi>If they take the Wings of the Morning and fly to the utmoſt Ends of the Earth, if they aſcend the Top of</hi> Carmel <hi>or deſcend into the Deeps of the Ocean,</hi> yet they cannot eſcape the Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of God's Eye, or the reach of his Arm! <hi>He is wiſe in Heart and mighty in Strength, who hath hardned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt him and proſpered?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6thly. We ſhould be excited by the conſideration of God's infinite Greatneſs, to be <hi>bold</hi> and <hi>magnanimous</hi> in the Service of God, particularly in undertaking <hi>great Labours</hi> for God, and in encountering great Difficulties and Dangers in
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:005500_0181_103964E2DFBB7960"/>
the Way of Duty, ſeeing that God will be to us at laſt, as to <hi>Abram</hi> of old, <hi>an exceeding great reward.</hi> And far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſhould expreſs <hi>magnanimity</hi> in a generous Contempt of all worldly Gain and Grandeur, when compared with God and his Service. And in a frequent Meditation upon, and vigorous Proſecution of divine and heavenly Objects! We are the Sons of a great Prince, born to a great Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and we are redeemed by a great Price, no leſs than the Blood of the Son of God: Seeing that the great God is our Shield and Buckler, let us deſpiſe the Threats of Worms, that are cruſh'd before the Moth! But</p>
            <p n="7">7thly. Is God Immenſe, and every where Preſent? Tthis opens a Scene of ſweet Conſolation to God's People in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Danger and Difficulty, becauſe he is preſent with them, not only with his Eſſence, but by his Grace. What then tho' they ſhould <hi>walk thro' the Valley and ſhadow of Death,</hi> yet they need fear no Evil, <hi>for God is with them, and his Rod and Staff ſhall comfort them!</hi> Particularly if they are in Solitude, Baniſhment, in Priſon, under Perſecution, the Power of Deceaſes, or any other Calamity. How ſweet is it to think that <hi>God is at their right Hand, yea as a Wall of Fire about them!</hi> And therefore it may be ſaid to them as <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> ſpoke to the Ship-Maſter in the Time of a Storm, "<hi>Truſt to fortune,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>for</hi> Julius <hi>is in the Ship.</hi>" And as <hi>Alexander</hi> to a Soldier,

               <q>What Man ſhouldeſt thou fear who art plac'd in the Boſom of God,</q> This is well expreſs'd in the following Stanza.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Sic ubi Chriſtus adeſt, nobis vel aranea murus.</l>
               <l>Sic ubi Chriſtus abeſt, vel murus aranea fiet.</l>

               <pb n="179" facs="unknown:005500_0182_103964E115190FE0"/>O! how refreſhing is it to think that God is not only with his People, preſent by his <hi>Eſſence,</hi> but preſent by his <hi>Wiſdom, Power</hi> and <hi>Providence!</hi> to conduct, ſupport, protect and revive them in every Difficulty, and to ſanctify them to them. How careful ſhould we be therefore, that this great omnipreſent God, ſhould be ours in the Covenant of his Grace, by embracing the Mediator of the Covenant by a living Faith, and living to him that died for us. We may be ſeparated from our earthly Friends very far, but God is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where: He was with <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Den of Lyons; with <hi>Jonah</hi> in the Water; with the <hi>three Children</hi> in the Fire; with <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> in Priſon, and with <hi>John</hi> in the Retirements of <hi>Patmos!</hi> If we live humbly and watchfully, no human Art or Violence can ſeperate him from our Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces! Well might the Pſalmiſt ſay of him, <hi>that he is a preſent Help in the Time of Trouble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8thly, Is God <hi>Omnipreſent?</hi> Then his Eye is continually upon us, in our moſt retir'd Receſſes. This Conſideration ſhould excite us to deteſt and avoid all ſecret Sins, becauſe a holy God, a juſt Judge, and righteous Avenger of Sin continually beholds us! and is preſent with us in our moſt obſcure Retreats! The Darkneſs bides not from him, but the Night ſhines as the Day. Hence the Lord himſelf commanded the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to remove every filthy Thing out of their Camp, becauſe he walk'd in the midſt thereof leaſt he ſhould turn away from them, <hi>Deut.</hi> xxiii. 14. The atheiſtical Imagination that God is far off, and takes no Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of human Actions, is the fatal Source of Sin and Security! Hence ſome are induc'd to commit thoſe Evils in Secret, which they dar'ſt not do, in the Preſence of the meaneſt Witneſs, not conſidering that Conſcience is as a Thouſand Witneſſes, and that God is infinitely greater <hi>than our Hearts, and knoweth all things,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> iii. 20.
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:005500_0183_103964DF91185F90"/>
A Senſe of God's Omnipreſence and Omniſcience, is a moſt excellent Defenſative againſt ſecret Impiety, it was by this, that gallant and virtuous <hi>Joſeph,</hi> warded off the formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Aſſault of his lacivious Miſtreſs, Gen. xxxix. 9. <hi>How can I do this great Wickedneſs, and Sin againſt God?</hi> And by this <hi>Job</hi> repell'd Temptations to Idolatry, Job xxxi. 26, 27, 28. <hi>If I beheld the Sun when it ſhin'd, or the Moon walking in Brightneſs, and my Heart hath been ſecretly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed, or my mouth hath kiſsed my Hand, this alſo were an Iniquity to be puniſhed by the Judge; for I ſhould have denyed the God that is above.</hi> The following Council of a <hi>Pagan</hi> is worthy of Remark, "<hi>Turpe quod acturus te ſine teſte,</hi> i. e. <hi>If thou art about to do any Thing Baſe or Ignoble, be afraid of your ſelf, tho' there be no Witneſs.</hi> It was likewiſe a noble Anſwer of a Chriſtian to a heathen Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, who being aſk'd where his God was, reply'd,
<q>Let me firſt underſtand from you where he is not.</q>
But,</p>
            <p n="9">9thly, Is God <hi>Immenſe</hi> and <hi>Omnipreſent?</hi> Then we ſhould be hereby excited to ſecret Duty, and all manner of Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. The Lord is every where Preſent with us, <q>For God is all Eye, and continually beholds us; he is all Ear and inceſſantly hears us,</q> as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> obſerves. He bottles all our Tears, and records all our ſecret Sighs and Groans, none of our Wreſtlings will be loſt! For that God who now ſees in Secret, will by and by reward openly. Surely Solitarineſs ſhould neither embolden us to Sin, or hinder us from Duty. Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> in his Body of Divinity, tells the following Story of two religious Men, who took two contrary Courſes with two lend Women in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim them,
<q>The one came to one of the Women as deſirous of her Company, ſo it might be with ſecreſy, and when ſhe had brought him to a cloſe Room that none could pry into, then he told her that all the Bolts and Bars which were,
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:005500_0184_103964DDAD6CD478"/>
could not keep God out. The other deſired to accompany with the other Woman openly in the Street, which when ſhe rejected as a mad requeſt, he told her it was better to do it before the Eyes of a multitude than of God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In fine let us be exhorted to labour to walk ſincerely with God evermore, and every where as preſent with us; in Imitation of Enoch, <hi>Gen.</hi> v. 24. <hi>And</hi> Enoch <hi>walked with God:</hi> Of <hi>Noah</hi> Gen. vi. 9. Noah <hi>was a juſt Man and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in his Generations, and</hi> Noah <hi>walked with God:</hi> Of <hi>Abram,</hi> Gen. 17.1. This the Holy Scriptures many Ways require, when it urges us not only to <hi>walk with God,</hi> but <hi>to walk before him, after him in his Name,</hi> and <hi>by his Spirit.</hi> Let us therefore obandon all Hypocriſy, walk with Fear and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence as under the Eye of God; on the one Hand abſtaining-from every Evil, becauſe of a preſent God; and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hand embracing every opportunity to do preſent Good, without delay and without diſguiſe, <hi>not with Eye Service as Men pleaſers, but in ſingleneſs of Heart fearing God,</hi> that we may have the Teſtimony of our Conſciences here, and be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of by the great Omnipreſent and Omniſcient God hereafter; which may God grant for CHRIST'S ſake.</p>

            <p>THIS Text contains an admiring Exclamation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the tranſcendent Knowledge and Wiſdom of God, more eſpecially apparent in the Buſineſs of Redemption and Predeſtination, in which we may obſerve three Things <hi>viz.</hi> 1ſt. The Perſon exclaiming, <hi>Paul</hi> an Apoſtle, yea one of the moſt eminent of that Order. A Perſon of a piercing Genius, and polite Learning, bred at the Feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> a Perſon of great Advances in Grace and divine Knowledge, a Perſon peculiarly famous for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied and extenſive Labours to promote the Good of Mankind, and moreover one whom the Almighty was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to inſpire after an extraordinary Manner, to communicate the Knowledge of himſelf in his Son to a loſt World! Yet here we may behold this excellent Perſon maz'd and non-plus'd, and that in a Matter belonging to his own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, a Matter which he made the ſubject of his careful En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries! This leads to a 2d. Particular in the Exclamation,
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:005500_0186_103964DA9FF23CE8"/>
               <hi>viz.</hi> The Particle <hi>O!</hi> which is the <hi>Manner</hi> of it. This repreſents the Strength and vehemence of the Apoſtles pious Paſſion, in this and in the two preceeding Chapters, he had ſpoken of many profound Myſteries, and anſwered many critical Queſtions. But here he makes a Pauſe, and falls into an Admiration of God, in reſpect of his Wiſdom and Knowledge! He ſeems like a Man who wades in deep Waters, till he looſes Ground, and then cries out, O the Depth! And ſo proceeds no farther. Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> in his <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopſis</hi> juſtly obſerves,
<q>That the Words of our Text are an Epilogue or Concluſion of the whole preceeding Diſputation, by which he teaches that he had aduced ſome Reaſons of Election and Reprobation, but that he neither knew them nor had taught them perfectly. As if he had ſaid I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded theſe Things as I could; but I am ſwallow'd up in the Abyſs of the Councils of God, which cannot be ſearched to Perfection, but muſt be adored.</q> Now the</p>
            <p n="3">3d. Particular in the Exclamation, or Outcry is the <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of it <hi>viz.</hi> The Depth and Unſearchableneſs of the Riches of God's Wiſdom and Knowledge, in his Judgments and Ways. By the <hi>Judgments of God,</hi> the Context leads us to underſtand, his Decrees and Purpoſes! And by his Ways, the Execution of them in General, and more eſpecially that Inſtance thereof which appear'd in the Rejection of the Jews, and calling in of the Gentiles to their Priviledges. The Apoſtle declares concerning both, that they are Unſearchable <hi>i. e.</hi> they cannot be fully underſtood, and perfectly found out by any Creature, however intelligent he be, eſpecially in this World <q>It's a Metaphor (<hi>ſays</hi> Pool <hi>in his Annotations</hi>) taken from Hounds, who have no Scent of the Game which they purſue. Nor can Men trace the Lord, or find out the Reaſon of his Providential Actings
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:005500_0187_103964D8E12B8808"/>
and therefore ſhould forbear cenſuring them.</q> Tho' great Wiſdom and Knowledge attend the divine Purpoſes and Providences, yet it is ſuch a Depth, as cannot be ſounded thoroughly by the Line of human Reaſon. And this the Apoſtle aſſures us of in the Text, which is under our preſent Conſideration. <hi>O the Depth! The Wiſdom and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God exceed all Dimenſions,</hi> as <hi>Zophar</hi> elegantly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, <hi>Job</hi> xi. 8, 9. <hi>It is higher than Heaven, deeper than Hell, longer than the Earth and broader than the Sea!</hi> The Word <hi>Riches</hi> ſignifies an exceſs of Wealth, by which a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon has more than he needs. And therefore here it intimates the exceeding Abundance, and tranſcendent Eminence and Affluence of the divine Wiſdom and Knowledge, which we we can neither ſpeak or think highly enough of! Altho' God's Wiſdom and Knowledge be one and the ſame in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, yet in our Manner of conceiving of them they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh'd: For Knowledge is meerly ſpeculative, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds Things ſimply as they are; but Wiſdom diſpoſes them in a certain order to ſome valuable End.</p>
            <p>From the Text thus explain'd, two Propoſitions offer themſelves to our Conſideration, <hi>viz.</hi> 1ſt. That the <hi>Knowledge of God is deep, unſearchable and Infinite.</hi> And 2dly. <hi>That the Wiſdom of God is ſo alſo</hi> I return to the 1ſt. Propoſition which was as before deſcrib'd. Altho' <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> be put after <hi>Wiſdom</hi> in our Text, (perhaps by the Figure call'd <hi>hyſteron proteron</hi>) yet in the Order of Nature it ſeems to be before it: For we firſt behold Things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we diſpoſe them in any Order to a certain End. Now in diſcourſing upon this Subject, I ſhall labour to proſecute the following Order.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. Prove the Infinity of the divine <hi>Knowledge.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>II. Shew the Kinds thereof.</item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="185" facs="unknown:005500_0188_103964D75C632A88"/>III. Speak of the Properties of God's <hi>Knowledge.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>IV. Point to its various Objects, and laſtly improve the whole. And</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1ſt. The ſacred Scriptures fully aſſert this Truth, <hi>Pſ.</hi> cxxxix. 9, 10. <hi>If I take the Wings of the Morning, and dwell in the utermoſt Parts of the Sea, even there ſhall thy Right Hand lead me.</hi> 1 Sam ii. 3. <hi>The Lord is a God of Knowledge, and by him Actions are weighed.</hi> Pro. v. 21. <hi>The Ways of a Man are before the Lord and he pondereth all his Paths.</hi> Pro. xv. 3. <hi>The Eyes of the Lord are in every Place, beholding the Evil and the Good.</hi> Job xxxiv. 21, 22. <hi>For his Eyes are upon the Ways of Men, and he ſeeth all their Goings. There is no Darkneſs nor Shadow of Death, where the Workers of Iniquity may hide themſelves.</hi> Heb. iv. 13. <hi>Neither is there any Creature that is not manifeſt in his Sight, but all Things are naked and opened unto the Eyes of him, with whom we have to do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And right Reaſon aſſures us of the ſame Truth. For</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Seeing to know and underſtand is an Excellency involving no Imperfection in it, it cannot without a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, be deny'd to an infinitely perfect being. And</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. How can the ſupream Being be without Knowledge, ſeeing he is the Fountain and Original of all that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which intelligent Beings poſſeſs? <hi>It is in his Light, that they ſee Light. Shall not he that planted the Eye ſee, and he that form'd the Ear hear?</hi> And without Knowledge what would the Almighty be but an Idol of whom it is ſaid, <hi>Pſ.</hi> cxv. 6, 7. <hi>That they have Eyes and ſee not, Ears and hear not.</hi> But thus to imagine of God, is the baſeſt Blaſphemy! Now the infinite Extent of the divine Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, is evident from the following Conſiderations, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Becauſe it is the ſame with his Being, which his Simplicity aſſures us of. Now the Being of God has been
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:005500_0189_103964D57098DF48"/>
prov'd to be infinite in a preceeding Sermon, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Knowledge muſt needs be ſo, which coincides with it. And</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. Seeing God has given Being to all Things at Firſt, it cannot without a Contradiction be ſuppos'd, that he ſhould be ignorant of the Effects of his own Power. Muſt not a Workman know his Work? Beſides</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. As <hi>Jehovah</hi> by his Almightineſs has brought the whole Univerſe out of Nothing into Being, ſo he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ſupports the ſame, otherwiſe it would immediatley return to its primitive Non-Entity or Nothingneſs: <hi>For it is in him we live move and have our Being.</hi> As we could not at firſt begin to exiſt without God, ſo neither can we ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt a Moment, or think, or ſpeak, or act without him, who is the great Source of Being and Spring of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! And</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. As God upholds every Thing by his Power, ſo he governs. All by his ſovereign wiſe and unerring Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the beſt Manner, and to the nobleſt End. <hi>viz. His own Glory.</hi> Surely then the End and Means conducing thereto, muſt be known by him; and indeed if the Kingdom of God did not rule over all, as the Scriptures aſſert, all Nature would be in Confuſion, the diſcordant Elements would immediately break their preſent Harmony, and jum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble into the wildeſt Chaos, and conſequently diſſolve in a tumultuous and extenſive Ruin! The Innocenſe, the Lives, the Goods of intelligent Creatures would inſtantly be made an eaſy Prey to rapacious Luſts and reſiſtleſs Violence! The whole Globe would groan with a melancholy Train of ſucceſſive Tragedies, and ſoon be ting'd with a crimſon Flood!</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. Seeing the Almighty hath fixed a Deputy in our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms, I mean Conſcience, whoſe Buſineſs it is to obſerve and
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:005500_0190_103964D3ECBE3940"/>
regiſter our whole Behaviour, whoſe company we cannot ſhun, whoſe Cognizance we cannot eſcape! How much more then muſt the Almighty be acquainted with all our Ways? <hi>For he is greater than our Hearts, and knoweth all Things,</hi> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>John</hi> obſerves. Again</p>
            <p n="6">6thly. Methinks the Conſideration of the general Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, gives additional Evidence to the aforeſaid Truth, for how can <hi>Jehovah</hi> judge all, unleſs he knows all? The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle aſſures us, <hi>Rom.</hi> ii. 16. <hi>That God will bring every Work into Judgment, with every ſecret Thing, whether it be Good or whether it be Evil.</hi> Yea, Hiſtory both ſacred and prophane inform us, of God's bringing to publick Light crimſon Evils, before veil'd with the Curtains of obſcureſt Secreſy! But I proceed to the 2d. propos'd, which was to ſpeak of the <hi>Kinds</hi> of divine Knowledge. And here I may obſerve, that as it reſpects Creatures, it is two fold, <hi>viz.</hi> Either intuitive, or approbative, or as others phraſe it, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or ſpecial. Now God's general Knowledge, or his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Intuition is that Property of the Almighty, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he only knows, or beholds all Things. In this Senſe it is ſaid <hi>Acts</hi> xv. 18. <hi>That known unto God are all his Works from the Beginning of the World.</hi> And</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. God's approbative or ſpecial Knowledge, is that divine Perfection, whereby <hi>Jehovah</hi> knows ſo, as to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of, and delight in what he knows! Hence our Lord, <hi>Mat.</hi> vii. 22. commands the <hi>Wicked to depart from him,</hi> and tells them that he never knew them, that is ſo as to approve of them. But I paſs on to the</p>
            <p n="3">3d. Propos'd, which was to ſpeak of the <hi>Properties</hi> of God's Knowledge. And</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. The Knowledge of God is moſt <hi>Simple,</hi> inaſmuch as he beholds at once all Things in himſelf, without the Uſe of any of thoſe Methods, whereby human Knowledge is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd,
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:005500_0191_103964D2661D4B30"/>
               <hi>viz.</hi> The Compoſition of Things of the ſame Kind, the Separation of Things of a different Kind, the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of one Thing with another, and the inferring of one Thing from onother. Hereby the human Mind proceeds gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually in a Way of reaſoning, from the Knowledge of Things more known, to the Knowledge of Things leſs known, but it is the Weakneſs of our Underſtandings, that renders thoſe Meaſures neceſſary, and therefore they cannot conſiſt with the Perfection of the ſupream Being. If a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion in Duration be an Imperfection, as was prov'd in a preceeding Sermon concerning the Eternity of God, a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion in Knowledge muſt be ſo likewiſe: For as it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily infers Increaſe of Knowledge by Obſervation and Experience, ſo it as evidently ſuppoſes preceeding Ignorance, which to aſcribe to the Almighty is deteſtable Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy. And</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. The Knowledge of God is <hi>Independent,</hi> becauſe it is not in him as an <hi>Accident, Quality,</hi> or <hi>Idea,</hi> different and ſeparable from his Eſſence, as it is in Creatures: For then he would be compounded of different Things, as Creatures are, and ſo might in Time ceaſe to be. No, his Simplicity aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us, as I obſerv'd before, that his Knowledge is the very ſame with his Eſſence, it is no other than God knowing, and therefore muſt needs be independent. That the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God is independent, has been already proved in a preceeding Sermon. But to proceed</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. The Knowledge of God is <hi>Eternal,</hi> inaſmuch as he neither begins, or ceaſes to know, as the Things known by him begin or ceaſe to be in themſelves. The Reaſon of which is, becauſe he knows all Things by his own Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence or eternal Purpoſes, and not by receiving Species, or Images, or Ideas from Objects without himſelf, as Creatures do. Here obſerve that two Things are required to
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:005500_0192_103964D0C7FE3808"/>
conſtitute the Knowledge of Creatures, <hi>viz.</hi> 1ſt. The Images or Ideas of Things. And 2dly. the Speculation of them, which implies the receiving of thoſe Ideas thro' the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Senſes by the Fancy and Contemplation of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing receiv'd, which conſiſts partly in the Compariſon of a Compoſition, Diviſion, Affirmation, or Negation; and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Deductions, or Reaſonings, whereby we proceed from Things more known to Things leſs known. The Method of human Knowledge is by comparing, compounding, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding and ſubſtracting the Images of Things receiv'd; as alſo by conſidering their Connection and Dependance, and infering one Thing from another. But the Ideas of God are not borrow'd from outward Objects? For if ſo, Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures muſt exiſt, before the divine Knowledge; and then it would be temporary and finite, this cannot be without the Deſtruction of the divine Eſſence. Two Things indeed are neceſſary to the divine Knowledge in our Apprehenſion diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct. <hi>viz.</hi> The Preſence of Ideas and the Perception of them, ſo that it may be thus deſcrib'd to be a perfect Intuition of himſelf or his own Ideas, but without any receiving of them from without, and without any Compariſon, Compoſition, Diviſion, or Inferences, as was obſerv'd before, reſpecting the Knowledge of Creatures, for all ſuch Things, do manifeſty involve Imperfection. <hi>Ameſius</hi> in his <hi>Medulla</hi> ſayeth,
<q>That the Idea of God, is no other than his very Eſſence, as it is underſtood by him to be imitable, in the Creature, or ſo that the Image of that Perfection, may after ſome ſort be expreſs'd in Creatures.</q> The Idea in a Man, is deriv'd from the Things themſelves, and therefore the Things muſt firſt exiſt in themſelves, then they approach our Senſes, and from thence to our Underſtanding, where they conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute ſome Idea to direct a following Operation; but the Idea of the Almighty is the Model or Pattern, which firſt
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:005500_0193_103964CF22E63FF8"/>
exiſts, according to which, Things in Time are exactly form'd, which Idea as it is abſoloutely conſidered in Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God, is but one, becauſe it is his Eſſence; but as it is conſidered reſpectively, it is manifold, becauſe it denotes many reſpects to the Creatures, ſo that the Idea of one Creature, is not the Idea of another. Thus it appears that Things are known by God as they are, and that there is a Connexion and Dependance among the divine Ideas. Whence ſprings the Order of Prior and Poſterior, which we obſerve in Predeſtination and Providence? It is doubtleſs on the Account of the Manifoldneſs of the divine Idea, in the former Senſe, that his Knowledge receives various Names; in reſpect of the <hi>Truth</hi> of Things, 'tis call'd <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> in reſpect of its <hi>Extent,</hi> 'tis call'd Omniſcience, in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of <hi>Paſt Things</hi> 'tis calld <hi>Remembrance. (Pſal.</hi> xxv. 6, 7.) In reſpect of preſent Things <hi>Sight. (Heb.</hi> iv. 13.) In reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of future Things <hi>Fore-Knowledge. (Rom.</hi> viii. 29.) In reſpect of the <hi>divine</hi> ordering of Things to a good <hi>End,</hi> 'tis called <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> in reſpect of the Knowledge of the moſt fit and proper Seaſons for all Things, it is call'd <hi>Prudence.</hi> But</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. The Knowledge of God is <hi>immutable,</hi> he knows not one Thing more than another, neither does he know Things more now than formerly, or more formerly than now; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he beholds all Things in his immutable Eſſence or Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, and in his Eternity, by which he exiſts without any Succeſſion in Duration, altogether unmov'd in all the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Periods of Time.</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. The Knowledge of God is <hi>Infinite</hi> perfect and diſtinct, he knows all Things without Suſpicion of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or Error. His Knowledge is diſtinct and particular, not confus'd and general. Hence it is ſaid, that when he had finiſhed the Works of Creation, that he ſaw every Thing, <hi>and behold it was very good,</hi> that is, ſuited to anſwer
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:005500_0194_103964CD8355AB10"/>
the End intended for them, agreeable to the Idea or Plan reſpecting them, which was from Everlaſting in his own Mind. Beſides the Knowledge of God is <hi>certain and infallible,</hi> without any Heſitation or Poſſibility of Miſtake: And therefore exceedingly differs from the Knowledge of Creatures, who can but gueſs and conjecture at Things to come, according to the preſent Appearances, and probable Tendency of Things. This laſt Property of <hi>the divine Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> naturally leads to the 4th propos'd, which was to point to the various <hi>Objects</hi> of the Knowledge of God, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of which will be a farther Confirmation of it's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Extent, by an Induction of Particulars. And</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. God knows <hi>himſelf</hi> and his <hi>own infinite Mind.</hi> viz. What he has done, can do, or will do. <hi>Rom.</hi> xi. 34. <hi>For who hath known the Mind of the Lord, and who hath been his Counſellor, or who hath firſt given to him?</hi> Here it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, that tho' Creatures know not the Mind of God, yet he does himſelf, and of himſelf, without Aſſiſtance from others. Seeing it is an Excellency in an intelligent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to know himſelf, tho' but in an imperfect Degree, therefore ſelf Knowledge in the higheſt degree of Eminence, muſt be aſcrib'd to the Almighty, who is infinitely perfect, and if ſo, then the Almighty muſt needs know all Things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are included in his Power and Purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. God knows all Things <hi>poſſible.</hi> As the Power of God is unlimited, he certainly can do infinitely more than he does, or will do. This extent of his Power he muſt needs know, becauſe he knows himſelf, the Almighty can do all Things that do not involve a Contradiction, <hi>e. g.</hi> He could create, if he pleaſed, Millions of Worlds, and Millions of more Orders of Creatures in them than there be in this! We our ſelves, as free Agents, can do more than we do, and as intelligent Agents we know the Inſtances where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in:
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:005500_0195_103964CBDC3659E0"/>
And how much more muſt this be aſcrib'd to God, who is infinite in Power, and calls the Things that are not as tho' they were? When <hi>David</hi> enquired of God 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xxiii. 12. <hi>Will</hi> Saul <hi>come down, and will the Men of</hi> Keilah <hi>deliver me up? The Almighty anſwered they will.</hi> Which ſignifies that the Almighty knew they would, except they had been prevented by his Providence. This Knowledge of Things poſſible, is call'd by <hi>Zanchy</hi> and others
<q>The Science of ſimple Intelligence.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3dly. The Almighty knows all Things that have been, are, or ſhall be. This is call'd <hi>the Science of Viſion,</hi> which reſpects the Exiſtence of Things, And</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. The Almighty knows <hi>all Things paſt,</hi> for they were once preſent, nay they may be ſaid, in propriety of Speech, to be now preſent to God, becauſe he has no Succeſſion in Duration, one Day is with him as a Thouſand Years, and a Thouſand Years as one Day. To ſuppoſe that the Almighty forgets any Thing, is in other Words to ſay that his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is leſs perfect than it was, which cannot conſiſt with infinite Perfection. And</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. God knows all Things <hi>preſent,</hi> which the Reaſons before offered to prove the Infinity of his Knowledge ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently confirm. Seeing all Things depend upon his Power and Providence, they muſt be known by him, for his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Power cannot be ſeparated.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. God likewiſe knows <hi>all things future,</hi> or to come, whether they are produced by a neceſſary Cauſe, ſuch as Fire or Water; or a voluntary Cauſe, ſuch as Men who act by rational Complacency, or a contingent Cauſe, which by its Nature, or in it Self, is not determin'd to this or that Effect. The many Propheſies of the Prophets concerning Events, many Ages before they came to paſs, ſufficiently confirm this Truth. It was well obſerv'd by <hi>Tertullian</hi>
               <pb n="193" facs="unknown:005500_0196_103964CA5591C250"/>
againſt <hi>Marcion,</hi> 
               <q>That the fore Knowledge of God, has as many Witneſſes, as he has made Prophets.</q> Was not <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>'s betraying our Lord an Effect of a voluntary or free Cauſe? And yet this was propheſied of. (<hi>John</hi> vi. ult. <hi>Acts</hi> iv. 28.) Of the like nature was <hi>Iſraels</hi> Oppreſſion in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and yet this was foretold Four Hundred Years before it came to paſs. (<hi>Gen.</hi> xv. 13.) Was not <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Advancement a contingent and very improbable Event, and yet it was made known ſeveral Years before it came to paſs by his Dream. (<hi>Gen.</hi> xxxvii. 5.) What could be more contingent than <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Death by a Random-ſhot, and yet this was foretold before he entred the Field of Battle. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> xxii. 17, 34. Things are ſaid to be contingent and accidental, becauſe they happen or come to paſs unexpectedly to us, without our Deſign or Knowledge, and becauſe the Cauſes that produce them, are not in themſelves neceſſarily deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd to produce ſuch an Effect; but nothing can come to paſs without <hi>Jehovah</hi>'s Cognizance, and Purpoſe. And hence the Scriptures inform us, that the moſt minute Events, fall within the Care and Compaſs of his Providence, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it ſelf to the moſt inconſiderable Creatures, <hi>a Sparrow cannot fall to the Ground,</hi> without our Fathers Permiſſion, <hi>and the very Hairs of our Head are numbered. Mat.</hi> x. 29, 30. The Time would fail, if I ſhould relate all the Propheſies mentioned reſpecting CHRIST. I ſhall therefore rather chooſe to obſerve, in Addition to what has been ſaid, that Almighty God knows all that concerns intelligent Beings in particular, as may appear by the following Inſtances, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. He knows all their <hi>Actions Pſ.</hi> cxix. 168. <hi>For all my Ways are before thee. There is no Darkneſs or Shadow of Death, where the Workers of Iniquity may hide themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="194" facs="unknown:005500_0197_103964C893B02940"/>2dly. He knows all our <hi>Words,</hi> Pſal. cxxxix. 4. <hi>For there is not a Word in my Tongue, but lo, O Lord, thou knoweſt it altogether.</hi>

            <p n="3">3dly. He knoweth our <hi>Hearts,</hi> this he claims as his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Prerogative, <hi>Rev.</hi> ii. 23. <hi>And all the Churches ſhall know that I am he that ſearcheth the Reigns and Hearts.</hi> He knows the <hi>Thoughts</hi> of the <hi>Heart:</hi> Hence he is ſaid to <hi>know them afar off, i. e.</hi> From <hi>Eternity,</hi> as Divines gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally interpret; and hence he is likewiſe ſaid <hi>to tell unto Man his Thoughts,</hi> Amos iv. 13. He knows the Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Thoughts of the Heart. Gen. vi. 5. <hi>And God ſaw that the Wickedneſs of Man was great on the Earth, and that every Imagination of the Thoughts of his Heart was only Evil continually.</hi> By the Imagination of the Thoughts, we may underſtand Thoughts in their Embryo not fully form'd. He knows the <hi>Intention</hi> of the Heart, Heb. iv. 12. <hi>And is a diſcerner of the Thoughts and Intents of the Heart.</hi> He knows the <hi>Bent</hi> of the Heart, Hoſ. 11.7. <hi>And my People are bent to Back-ſliding from me, though they call'd them to the moſt high, none at all would exalt him.</hi> And the Knowledge God hath of what has been mention'd, and of every thing elſe, is certain and evident. Hence <hi>Zanchy</hi> pertinently obſerves.
<q>That Knowledge by the Underſtanding, is either Opinion, Faith or Science. Opinion, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> is neither a certain or evident Knowledge, but ſo aſſents to the affirmative or negative Part that it Doubts concerning the other. <hi>Faith, ſays he,</hi> is a certain, but not evident Knowledge! (Heb. <hi>xi. 1.</hi>) but Science is both a certain and evident Knowledge, this therefore up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both Accounts is truly and properly aſcrib'd to God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But againſt what has been offer'd in Confirmation of the Infinite and univerſal Extent of Gods Knowledge, the <hi>Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> object, 1ſt. That God is ſaid to

            <p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It's true they have not in themſelves, but they have in the Decree of God, <hi>who does all Things after the Council of his own Will,</hi> Eph. i. 11. But I proceed to the Improvement. And</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. The Conſideration of God's <hi>Omniſcience</hi> ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter us from ſecret Sins. Impenitent Tranſgreſſors are apt to ſpeak in the Language of <hi>Eliphaz, How doth God know? Can he judge thro' the thick Cloud?

<pb n="196" facs="unknown:005500_0199_10396614D8B25F58"/>
is no Darkneſs or ſhadow of Death where the Workers of Iniquity may hide themſelves.</hi> The Darkneſs is as the Light to God, and the Night ſhines as the Day. As <hi>Auguſtine</hi> obſerves, "Jehovah <hi>is all Eye,</hi>" he not only beholds ſecret Impieties with juſt Indignation, but records them in order to the laſt Judgment. Then will be made manifeſt the hidden Councils of Sinners Hearts: Then ſhall they be expos'd to all that Shame and Miſery, which their diſguiſed Impieties deſerve! And</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. The Conſideration of God's <hi>Omniſcience</hi> ſhould powerfully incite us to ſecret Duties, ſeeing our heavenly Father who <hi>ſeeth in ſecret will reward openly,</hi> Mat. vi. 4. Hypocrites love much outward Show and Oſtentation, as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> of old, who made Broad their Philacteries.— But truly pious Souls incline to ſcrene much of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion from others Obſervance, by a Vail of Modeſty. How comfortably does our Lord ſpeak to his Church in her Retirements. <hi>Cant.</hi> ii. 14. <hi>O my Dove, that art in the Clifts of the Rock, in the ſecret Places of the Stairs, let me ſee thy Countenance, let me hear thy Voice; for ſweet is thy Voice, and thy Countenance is comely,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3dly. This Subject alſo invites us to be <hi>ſincere</hi> both in our ſecret and publick Duties, and in all manner of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation after <hi>David's</hi> Example, 1 Chron. xxv. 17. <hi>I know alſo my God that thou tryeſt the Heart, and haſt Pleaſure in Uprightneſs.</hi> Seeing that the moſt retir'd Receſſes of our Souls are open to the All-penetrating Eye of God, let us watch our Hearts diligently and chiefly labour to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove our ſelves to him, who principally requires the Heart, without which all outward Service is but a ſpecious Kind of Mockry. And</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. The Conſideration of the <hi>divine Omniſcience</hi> ſhould make us aſham'd of our Ignorance; ſurely we are but
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:005500_0200_1039661316B9DF00"/>
of Yeſterday, and know nothing comparatively. What Reaſon have we to lament with <hi>Agur,</hi> that <hi>we are as brute Beaſts before God, and have not attain'd to the Knowledge of the Holy?</hi> If we have a little Knowledge, let us beware that we be not puff'd up with it; for the higheſt acquired Attainments in Knowledge here, are as nothing compar'd with what we are Ignorant of; and leſs than nothing when compared with the infinite <hi>Abyſs</hi> of <hi>divine Knowledge.</hi> If we have received any Thing from God, why ſhould we boaſt as tho' we had not received it, eſpecially conſidering that by thoſe Talents we are more deeply indebted to God as Stewards under him, who muſt give an Account. And,</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. Is God <hi>Omniſcient?</hi> Then if we are ſincere, we may hope and rejoice in him in every Difficulty, whether Perſonal or Publick! Are we reproached by our fellow Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? What then? Let us ſpeakin the Apoſtle's Language, 2 Cor. i. 12. <hi>For our rejoycing is this, the Teſtimony of our Conſcience, that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, not with fleſhly Wiſdom, but by the Grace of God, we have had our Converſation in the World, and more abundantly to you-wards. Are we in Poverty and Want? our heavenly Father know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that we need Support. (Mat.</hi> vi. 31.) <hi>Are we perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? our Father beholds the Miſchief and the Spite, and will requite it with his Hand,</hi> as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> expreſſes it. <hi>Are we in Deſertion, and ready to ſay that God hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten us?</hi> How ſupporting is it in ſuch a Caſe to think upon that ſweet Paſſage, Iſa. xlix. 15. <hi>Can a Woman for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get her ſucking Child?</hi> And that of the Apoſtle, 2 Tim. ii. 19. <hi>The Lord knoweth who are his.</hi> What tho' we be environ'd with Trouble, ſo that we can't ſee the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Paſſage open for an Eſcape; yet God knows how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his People: He can with the Temptation, ſend a Door of Deliverance! And what tho' the poor Church be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:005500_0201_1039661192BF4160"/>
with Clouds and Darkneſs, and every way encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs'd with Enemies and Diſtreſſes, ſo that a human Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is quite nonplus'd and cannot ſee how Relief ſhould come? Then it's comfortable to think that all Things are open to the Eye of God, and that he who ſits in Heaven, derides the Councils of his Enemies, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> ii.) and will bring them to Nought in his own Time, and that no Weapon form'd againſt <hi>Zion</hi> ſhall proſper.</p>
            <p>In fine let us glorify God on the Account of his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and cry out with the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in our Text, <hi>O the Depth of the Knowledge of God!</hi> And let us labour to imitate this divine Perfection, leſt we be as Brutes, in whom there is no Underſtanding, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> xxxii. 9) without divine Knowledge the Mind cannot be Good, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves. It was a pertinent Obſervation of Biſhop <hi>Beveridge,</hi> in his Thoughts on Religion, <q>That as God would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of blind Sacrifices under the Law, ſo neither will be of blind Services under the Goſpel.</q> Religion is a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Service and therefore it muſt be attended with Knowledge (<hi>Rom.</hi> xii. 1.) The Almighty complains by the Prophet, <hi>that his People were deſtroy'd for lack of Knowledge.</hi> Hoſ. iv. 6. Hence the Almighty promiſes to ſend <hi>Paſtors after his own Heart, which ſhould feed the People with Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Underſtanding</hi> Jer. iii. 15. Hence the Prieſts Lips are ſaid to preſerve <hi>Knowledge.</hi> But on the contrary its ſaid of the Phariſees, <hi>that they took away the Key of Knowledge,</hi> Luk xi. 52. And that the Ignorant and Inſtable wreſt the Scriptures to their own Deſtruction. Therefore let us earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeek the Knowledge of God in the uſe of all proper Means, for this is the Foundation of all reaſonable Religion.</p>

               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>YOU may remember that in the preceeding Diſcourſe, after an Explication of the Text, I obſerv'd theſe two Propoſitions from it, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>the Knowledge of God was Deep, Unſearchable, and Infinite.</hi> And 2dly, That <hi>the Wiſdom of God was ſo alſo.</hi> The firſt of which has been already diſcours'd upon; the 2d, therefore comes now to be conſidered. In Relation to which it will be neceſſary to ſpeak upon theſe four Particulars following, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>I. The <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>divine Wiſdom.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>II. <hi>It's Kinds.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>III. It's <hi>Properties</hi> or <hi>Qualities.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>IV. Its <hi>Diſplays.</hi> And laſtly improve the whole. And.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1ſt. The <hi>divine Wiſdom</hi> may be thus deſcrib'd, <hi>viz. That it is that pecular Virtue or Perfection of the divine Mind, whereby the Almighty knows by what Methods he can beſt compaſs and illuſtrate his own Glory in all his Works, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Creation, Redemption, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Providence.</hi> There is a twofold Act of Wiſdom, and both eminent in God. The firſt is <hi>Knowledge</hi> in the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Things,</hi> which is call'd
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:005500_0203_1039660E669F5C10"/>
               <hi>Science.</hi> The 2d. is <hi>Knowledge</hi> how to <hi>order</hi> and <hi>diſpoſe of Things</hi> in the beſt Manner, and to the beſt End, which is call'd <hi>Prudence.</hi> Tho' Wiſdom neceſſarily ſuppoſe. Knowledge, yet it contains more than Knowledge; for there may be but little Wiſdom where there is much Knowledge, tho' there can be no Wiſdom without Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge! <q>Knowledge, <hi>as Dr.</hi> Ridgely <hi>well obſerves,</hi> is as it were the Eye of the Soul, whereby it apprehends or ſees Things in a true Light, and ſo it is oppos'd to Ignorance, or not knowing Things; but Wiſdom is that whereby the Soul is directed in the ſkilful Management of Things, or in ordering them for the beſt. And this is oppos'd not ſo much to Ignorance or Error of Judgment, as to Folly, or Error in Conduct, which is a defect of Wiſdom.</q> In Wiſdom therefore there are theſe four <hi>Ingredients, viz.</hi> 1ſt. A <hi>fixing upon</hi> the nobleſt <hi>End.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly, A <hi>Choice of</hi> the beſt <hi>Means, viz.</hi> Such as directly conduce to attain the End deſign'd.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, An <hi>alloting</hi> of the <hi>fitteſt Seaſon</hi> for the Uſe of the aforeſaid Means, together with the Obſervation thereof.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly, A. <hi>Foreſight of,</hi> and <hi>Proviſion againſt all</hi> ſuch <hi>Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi> as may mar our Attainment of the End propos'd, or offer Occaſion for uneaſy Senſations, on the Account of Miſmanagement! Now every of the aforeſaid <hi>Ingredients</hi> are truly applicable to <hi>Jehovah:</hi> For 1ſt. he hath fix'd upon the beſt End in all his Works, <hi>viz. His own Glory.</hi> Hence it is ſaid <hi>that he made all Things for himſelf,</hi> Pro. xvi. 4. But here it may be enquired, what is the <hi>Glory</hi> of God? And how does it appear to be the beſt End?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The <hi>Glory</hi> of God may be thus deſcrib'd, <hi>viz. That is the Brightneſs of his infinite Eminence known and manifeſted.</hi> But how does this appear to be the beſt End?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="201" facs="unknown:005500_0204_1039660CC3805CC0"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> As God himſelf is the beſt Being, the Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of himſelf, muſt by Conſequence be the moſt excellent and noble End! And what is this but his declarative Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? Seeing that Creatures are deriv'd from him as their producing Cauſe, it is but reaſonable that they ſhould be referr'd to him, or his Glory as their End. Hence ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle, for of him, and thro' him, and to him are all Things!</hi> But ſeeing that God is of himſelf, he can have no other final Cauſe but himſelf. If he had any other Supream End but his own Glory, he would aim ultimately at ſomething below himſelf, which is abſur'd, and depend on ſomething beſides himſelf, which is impoſſible. From what has been ſaid it is evident, that the firſt Character or Ingredient of Wiſdom, <hi>viz.</hi> a fixing upon the nobleſt End, is juſtly applicable to Almighty God. I proceed to the</p>
            <p n="2">2d. Which was the <hi>Choice</hi> of the <hi>beſt Means</hi> directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to attain the End deſign'd. Now that this is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to God, will appear by the following Particulars. 1ſt. <hi>Jehovah</hi> hath made his Glory manifeſt or viſible, by engraving large and legible Characters thereof in his Word and Works, in both which we may eaſiy diſcern many Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps or Signatures of his adorable Attributes! Now with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this Manifeſtation, however Infinite and Tranſcendent, the eſſential Emminence or Perfection of God might be, yet it would not be perceived or celebrated by Creatures. And,</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, God hath made intelligent Creatures capable thro' his Aſſiſtance and Influence to perceive, acknowledge, and honour his Excellency and Glory, manifeſted as aforeſaid. Tho' irrational and inanimate Creatures may objectively glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy God. In this reſpect it is ſaid that <hi>the Heavens and Earth do ſhew forth God's Glory, i. e.</hi> They offer Occaſion to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teligent Beings to magnify God's Name, by ſhewing the
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:005500_0205_1039640BAB9FA5F8"/>
Power and other Perfections of God apparent in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. <hi>For the inviſible Things of him, from the Creation of the World are clearly ſeen, being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the Things that are made, even his eternal Power and Godhead; ſo that they are without Excuſe.</hi> Yet none but intelligent Creatures can actively and with Deſign, Glorify God. And</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, Becauſe ſome are either ſo Stupid or Negligent, that they cannot or will not, in a way of reaſoning, infer his Perfections from his Works; therefore the Almighty has implanted a <hi>Monitor</hi> in Mens Boſoms to inform them of their Duty, and repreſent the Danger of Neglect in the moſt convincing Manner. Hence it is ſaid that the <hi>Heathens</hi> not having the Law, <hi>i. e.</hi> The <hi>moral Law</hi> written, were a <hi>Law</hi> unto themſelves: Their Conſciences in the mean Time accuſing or excuſing one another. And</p>
            <p n="4">4thly, To add <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Force</hi> to the Inſtructions and Admonitions of Conſcience, and to enlarge our views of his Attributes, more obſcurely repreſented by his Works! <hi>Jehovah</hi> has added his Word, <hi>which he hath magnified above all his Name.</hi> But to proceed, the</p>
            <p n="3">3d, Ingredient of Wiſdom is likewſe applicable to the Almighty, for he hath appointed to every thing its Time and Seaſon, and made them beautiful therein: All his Ways are Judgment, calculated in every of their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances with the deepeſt Penetration! (<hi>Deut.</hi> xxxii. 4.) And</p>
            <p n="4">4thly, He hath guarded againſt all adverſe Occurrences, by his eternal and unalterable Purpoſes; his Almighty power and ſovereign Providence, which preſide over all Events: So that the Wrath of Man ſhall be conſtrain'd to praiſe him. He will in the Iſſue get himſelf Glory from all his Creatures, either in an <hi>objective, Active,</hi> or <hi>paſive Way.</hi> His Mercy or Juſtice will have a Tribute of Honour
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:005500_0206_1039660B218E06E0"/>
from all the intelligent Creation, either in their Salvation or Damnation! But I proceed to the</p>
            <p n="2">2d. Propos'd, which was to ſpeak of the <hi>Kinds</hi> of <hi>divine Wiſdom:</hi> Now the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God is twofold, <hi>viz. Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> and <hi>Perſonal,</hi> the <hi>perſonal Wiſdom</hi> of God is our Lord JESUS CHRIST, he is call'd <hi>the Wiſdom of God,</hi> by way of Appropriation, on Account of his mediatorial Office: Becauſe herein the <hi>divine Wiſdom</hi> has been moſt marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly manifeſted, <hi>In him,</hi> as Mediator for his Peoples Benefit, <hi>are hid all the Treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledge,</hi> Col. ii. 3. The <hi>eſſential Wiſdom</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is what is Common to all the Perſons of the ſacred Trinity, and is the Subject of our preſent Diſcourſe. I paſs on therefore to the</p>
            <p n="3">3d. Propos'd, which was to mention the Properties or Qualities of divine Wiſdom. And</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. It is <hi>Infinite</hi> as our Text aſſerts, <hi>O the Depth of the Wiſdom and Knowledge of God, how unſearchable are his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and his Ways paſt finding out!</hi> It muſt of neceſſity be Infinite, becauſe it is himſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. <hi>Original</hi> Wiſdom, of this the Royal Prophet ſpeaks in bold and noble Strains, Iſa. xl. 12, 13. <hi>Who hath mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured the Waters in the Hollow of his Hand, and meted out the Heavens with a Span, and comprehended the Duſt of the Earth in a Meaſure, and weighed the Mountains in Scales, and the Hills in a Ballance? Who hath directed the Spirit of the Lord, or being his Counſellor hath taught him?</hi> He is the great Fountain from which all created Beings derive their Streams; yea he is wiſdom it ſelf in the Abſtract, which his Simplicity proves! And</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. He is <hi>univerſal Wiſdom,</hi> John xxi. 17. <hi>Lord thou knoweſt all Things, thou knoweſt that I Love thee.</hi> And</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="204" facs="unknown:005500_0207_1039660979EF2958"/>4thly. He is <hi>unerring</hi> and <hi>infallible Wiſdom;</hi> this then is the Meſſage which we have heard of him, and declare unto you that <hi>God is Light, and in him is no Darkneſs at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5thly. He is <hi>immutable Wiſdom,</hi> and hence he is call'd the <hi>Father of Lights, with whom there is no Variableneſs nor Shadow of turning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6thly. He is <hi>incommunicable or unparallel'd Wiſdom,</hi> and hence he is call'd <hi>the only Wiſe God,</hi> Rom. xvi. 27. He is likewiſe ſaid to be <hi>wonderfull in Council, and excellent in Working,</hi> Iſa. xxviii. 29. There is indeed ſome faint Shadow of the <hi>divine Wiſdom</hi> in Creatures, but the <hi>eſſential Wiſdom</hi> of God cannot be communicated. The <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of all Creatures put together, is but as a ſingle Drop compar'd with the immenſe Ocean, of <hi>Wiſdom in God.</hi> But the</p>
            <p n="4">4th. Propos'd comes now to be conſidered, which was to ſpeak of the <hi>Diſplays</hi> of God's <hi>VViſdom</hi> in his <hi>VVorks.</hi> And</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. The <hi>Wiſdom of God appears with much Beauty,</hi> in the <hi>Works of Creation:</hi> How noble is the Harmony that ſubſiſts among the numerous Parts of this vaſt <hi>Machine,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the diſcordant Elements of which they are form'd? How amiable and amazing is the Order of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviency among its Parts, together with their general Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to promote the Good of the whole Frame?

our Admiration. Job. xxxviii. 31, 32, 33, 44. <hi>Canſt thou bind the ſweet influences of</hi> Pleiades, <hi>or looſe the Bands of Orion?

Canſt thou lift up thy Voice to the Clouds, that abundance of Waters may cover thee?</hi> How curious is the Structure of that little World <hi>the Body of Man,</hi> in reſpect of the Form, Number, and Situation of its Parts, both for Beauty and Service?

Is it not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable that among that vaſt Variety of Parts, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the World, that not one is Defective, not one Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, or Redundant, even the ſmalleſt Inſect loudly proclaims the Wiſdom of it's Former? For what leſs than infinite Wiſdom cou'd comprize all the Springs and Organs of Life, Senſe, and Motion in ſo ſmall a Compaſs? How juſtly may we Uſe the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s, and the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts</hi> Language? <hi>He hath made the Earth by his Power, he hath eſtabliſh'd the World by his Wiſdom, and ſtrech'd out the Heavens by his Diſcretion.

            <p n="2">2dly. Is not the <hi>Wiſdom of God diſplay'd</hi> in the <hi>Work</hi> of <hi>Redemption</hi> moſt gloriouſly, even to the juſt Aſtoniſhment of Men and Angels? Hence the Apoſtle calls it the <hi>mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Wiſdom of God,</hi> Eph. iii. 10. <hi>(polupocilos Sophia)</hi> This the Angels deſire to look into! <hi>Divine Wiſdom</hi> has found out a Way to ſatisfy <hi>divine Juſtice,</hi> which was wrong'd by the Creatures revolt from God, thro' the Sufferings of a Mediator in their Room; a <hi>Way</hi> to magnify the Law, and
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:005500_0209_103966061DB63380"/>
make it honourable by the perfect Obedience of the Son of God in the Tranſgreſſors Place: Hereby both the Precept and Penalty of the Law are fully anſwered, and a Door opened for the Manifeſtation of <hi>rich, pure</hi> and <hi>glorious</hi> Grace, in the Remiſſion and Salvation of fallen Mankind, without infringing upon the Rights of Juſtice, Truth and Holineſs: Surely ſuch a Deviſe as this, would have nonplus'd all the Creation. What leſs than <hi>infinite Wiſdom</hi> could bring the greateſt Glory to God, and the greateſt Good to Mankind out of the greateſt Evil, <hi>viz.</hi> Sin? Both which are directly contrary to the Nature of it! And this indeed is the true State of the Caſe; for as it is certain that Believers are now upon a more ſure Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, reſpecting their Happineſs, than our firſt Parents were before the Fall; becauſe their Stock is now in the Hands of the Mediator, which was before in their own, ſo we cannot ſee how the Grace and Mercy of God could have had ſuch marvelous and bright Diſplays, had not Sin been in the World! Thus out of the Eater <hi>divine Wiſdom</hi> hath brought forth Meat, and out of the Strong, Sweetneſs. It might be here likewiſe obſerved, that the deferring of the Meſſias coming in the Fleſh for a long Space of Time, is no inconſiderable Diſcovery of divine Wiſdom: For hereby Room was given for the Tryal and Exerciſe of the Faith and Patience of God's People, in depending on his Word, and waiting for the Accompliſhment thereof; for thus was <hi>Jehovah</hi> glorify'd, Heb. xi. 13. <hi>Theſe all died in Faith, not having received the Promiſes, but having ſeen them afar off, and were perſwaded of them, and embraced them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that they were Strangers and Pilgrims on the Earth.</hi> And indeed the Time of our Lords coming was moſt ſeaſonable; for then the Darkneſs of Impiety moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully prevail'd, and real Religion languiſh'd, and had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:005500_0210_10396604799A8948"/>
totally expir'd. It was proper therefore that then <hi>the Day ſpring from on High ſhould viſit a benighted World, and the Sun of Righteouſneſs ariſe upon them to turn away Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs from</hi> Jacob!</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. The <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is alſo wonderfully <hi>diſplay'd</hi> in his <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>Prividence!</hi> in Relation to the World in general, and to his Church and People in particular.</p>
            <p>The inſenſible Parts of the Creation are conducted by divine Providence to an End which they know not. The Sun obſerves his ſtated Periods of riſing and ſetting, and runs his wonted Round to enlighten and animate this low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Globe, and the Stars with exact Order atten'd their ſeveral Motions, many irrational Animals act with a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, like that of intelligent Beings, Jer. viii. 7. <hi>The Stork in the Heaven knoweth her appointed Times, and the Turtle, and the Crane, and the Swallow obſerve the Time of their coming. The Ant by prudent induſtry, lays up her Winter Store before it's Approach!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What elſe than a wiſe and watchful Providence keeps the whole Syſtem of Things in its proper Situation, ſo that the Elements do not break Looſe and deſtroy each other? And what but this bounds the Wrath of ſavage Men, and makes it turn to the divine Praiſe? But more particularly in Relation to the Church of God, how mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velouſly has the Wiſdom of God appear'd in his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence?</p>
            <p>In the Time of the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> while Men liv'd a long Space, God was pleaſed to inſtruct his People by immediate Revelation and Tradition; but when the Lives of Men were much contracted, and there was Danger, on that Account of the Corruption of Tradition, it pleaſed God to communicate his Mind and Will to his People by Writing; which is a Method leſs liable to the aforeſaid
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:005500_0211_10396602F4BC0000"/>
Inconvenience. Moreover in the written Word, the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty inſtructed his Church <hi>gradually</hi> in the Knowledge of the Goſpel, firſt more obſcurely by Types and Shadows; and afterwards more plainly by a clearer Revelation: Thus the Almighty treated them like Children, as they were able to bear it!</p>
            <p>And doubtleſs the <hi>harder</hi> and <hi>more coſtly Services</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, under the <hi>Jewiſh Oeconomy,</hi> tended to make Men long for, and more eagerly embrace an eaſier Diſpenſation!</p>
            <p>But the Wiſdom of God in his Providence towards his Church, has appear'd in nothing more eminently than in baffling the Contrivances and Attempts of her Enemies, and in turning them to her Advantage! A noble Inſtance of this we read of in the Book of <hi>Eſter,</hi> when <hi>Haman</hi> had cruelly devis'd the utter Ruin of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church and Nation, and had brought his malicious Plot almoſt to the fatal Period of Execution! How admirably was it fruſtrated, and the Tables turn'd in his own overthrow? While poor <hi>Mordecai,</hi> the Mark of his ambitious Rage, was honour'd and protected, and the Church eſtabliſh'd! The Incident that led to this ſurprizing Revolution of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, was truly aſtoniſhing, <hi>viz.</hi> The King's Reſtleſsneſs one Night, and reading in the Book of the <hi>Chronicles</hi> of <hi>Mordecai</hi>'s Services to the Kingdom!</p>
            <p>And indeed in all Ages it has pleas'd the all-wiſe God to make Perſecution of Service to his Church, ſo that there is good Ground for that antient and common Proverb, that <hi>The Blood of the Martyrs, is the ſeed of the Church:</hi> But in Particular the Perſecution at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is a memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Inſtance of this Kind, for the Chriſtians being thereby diſpers'd, were Means of ſpreading the Goſpel far and wide! And did not <hi>Iſrael's</hi> Oppreſſion in <hi>Egypt,</hi> prepare the Way for their happy Deliverance, by making them
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:005500_0212_103966015090FB68"/>
more deſirous after it, and more ready to embrace the Call of God, in abandoning their Captivity?</p>
            <p>And that I may ſay many Things in one, was not Satan and his Inſtruments overſhot, in their own Bow, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Crucifiction of Chriſt? What they deſign'd for Evil, has not God's Wiſdom turn'd to the greateſt Good? By <hi>Death, Life</hi> is brought to Believers, by the bittereſt <hi>Pain,</hi> the ſweeteſt <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> and by the <hi>baſeſt Ignominy,</hi> the <hi>higheſt</hi> Honour!</p>
            <p>An immemorial Inſtance of the Wiſdom of God, in his Providence in compaſſing a noble End, by contrary Means, we have reſpecting <hi>Joſeph</hi> his being ſold to the <hi>Iſhmalites,</hi> and impriſon'd in <hi>Egypt,</hi> were Occaſions introductory to his exalted Dominion over that Nation; and this the Occaſion of his Father's Family coming and reſiding there, and ſo of the fulfilment of the Propheſies, reſpecting <hi>Iſraels</hi> abode in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and Deliverance out of it, in after Time. The Wheels of Providence are full of Eyes. It may be truly ſaid of them, that <hi>(Non ceco impetu volvunter rote.)</hi> the Wheels of Providence are not govern'd by blind Chance. But the Time will not ſerve to relate any more Inſtances. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proceed to the <hi>Improvement</hi> of this Subject And</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. The Conſideration of the divine Wiſdom ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite us to Modeſty in our Meditations upon the Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which we ſometimes meet with in God's Word and Works! Tho' the Myſteries of Faith do not contradict human Reaſon, yet they in ſome Inſtances tranſcend its Reach! And there be ſometimes obſcure Texts in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God too difficult for us to ſolve. The <hi>Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty walks ſometimes in the great Deep, and his Footſteps are not known, he makes Darkneſs his Pavilion, and hides the Face of his Throne!</hi> In this Caſe let us conſider, <hi>that the Fooliſhneſs of God is wiſer than Men,</hi> and cry out with the
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:005500_0213_103965FF8F72E908"/>
Apoſtle in our Text, <hi>O the Depth of the Riches of the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Knowledge of God, how unſearchable are his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and his Ways paſt finding out?</hi> Let us beware of call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the divine Wiſdom to the Bar of our Reaſon, with the <hi>Socinians,</hi> 1 Cor. iii. 18. <hi>If any Man among you ſeemeth to be wiſe in this World, let him become a Fool that he may be wiſe.</hi> Not a Fool really, with <hi>Enthuſiaſts,</hi> who reject all uſe of Reaſon in Religion, but <hi>a Fool in his own Eyes,</hi> i. e. Let him be <hi>humble</hi> under a <hi>Senſe</hi> of his Folly and Weakneſs, and reject all Dependance upon his own Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. And</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. This Subject learns us the Reaſonableneſs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in every change of Circumſtance, ſeeing the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely wiſe God knows beſt what is beſt for us. If we were left to our own Choice, we ſhould certainly ruin our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, with what calm Confidence ſhould we then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our Way to God, that he may bring it to paſs. And</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. The Wiſdom of God offers <hi>Food for our Faith,</hi> and <hi>Comfort</hi> to our Souls under the darkeſt Appearances of divine Providence reſpecting the Church. We are ſure that he is the Ruler, and that he rules in Wiſdom, nothing hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens beſides his Purpoſe, or without his Providence. He can make the moſt contrary Things promote his Kingdoms Good, as was obſerv'd before, and he has promis'd that he will do ſo. (<hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 28.) And elſewhere he has ſaid, that <hi>no Weapon form'd againſt</hi> Zion, <hi>ſhall proſper.</hi> Then let us reſign our Wiſdom and Wills to God, let us believingly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Affairs of God's Kingdom into the Mediators Hands, and expect the fulfilment of his Word.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. Is God's Wiſdom diſplay'd in his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Works?</hi> Then let us <hi>meditate</hi> on them, with more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency and Care, and aſcribe to God the Glory of that
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:005500_0214_103965FDCA09CB30"/>
Wiſdom which appears in them, in the Sentiments of our Minds, by the Speeches of our Lips, and the Actions of our Lives. It is a juſt Obſervation of the <hi>Pſalmiſt, That the Works of the Lord are great, ſought out of all thoſe that have Pleaſure therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5thly. Is God Infinite in Wiſdom? Then 1ſt. <hi>Let us ask</hi> Wiſdom <hi>of him who giveth to all Men liberally and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braideth not, and it ſhall be given us.</hi> Jam. i. 5. And 2dly. Let us according to our Meaſure <hi>imitate the divine VViſdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. By <hi>fixing</hi> upon an <hi>End,</hi> in the Enjoyment of which we may be compleatly happy, <hi>viz.</hi> God's Glory and the Enjoyment of him. And</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. By the <hi>Choice</hi> of <hi>proper Means</hi> tending to that End, ſuch as Faith, Repentance and Holineſs, <hi>as God is Holy,</hi> ſo thoſe that expect to enjoy him, muſt be like him.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. By <hi>improving</hi> the <hi>preſent Seaſons,</hi> in the uſe of the aforeſaid Means. This is the Command of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. 1, 2. <hi>VVe then as VVorkers together with him, beſeech you alſo that ye receive not the Grace of God in vain. (For he ſaith, I have heard thee in a Time accepted, and in the Day of Salvation have I ſuccoured thee: Behold, now is the accepted Time; behold now is the Day of Salvation.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To <hi>this</hi> we ſhould be excited likewiſe, by conſidering the Shortneſs and Uncertainty of our Time and its Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, together with the vaſt Moment that depends upon the Improvement thereof. And</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. We ſhould guard againſt every Appearance of Evil, that tends to obſtruct us in the <hi>Purſuit</hi> of our chief End. The very contrary to the aforeſaid Particulars, conſtitutes the Folly of the ungodly World. They either fix upon ſome Enjoyment here as their chief End, or if
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:005500_0215_103965FC44CFB468"/>
they pretend a higher End, take contrary Meaſures to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it. They neglect the preſent Seaſons of Mercy, <hi>with the Fool they have a Price in their Hand, but no Heart to it. They likewiſe ruſh into Places of Temptation, and ſo are eaſily enſnared, and ſell their Salvation for a Thing of Nought.</hi>

            <p>IN the Words of our Text, we have a Summary of the Gracious Covenant, God was pleas'd to make with <hi>Abram</hi> of old, containing theſe two Things following, which deſerve our Notice, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. What God's Covenant People may <hi>expect him to be to them,</hi> in theſe Words, <hi>I am the Almighty God. (Elſhadai)</hi> 
               <q>This is the Name of God, (<hi>ſays Mr.</hi> Henery <hi>in his Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>) that is moſtly us'd throughout the Book of <hi>Job,</hi> at leaſt thirty Times in the Diſcourſes of that Book, in which <hi>Jehovah</hi> is us'd but once.</q> This Name (as Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> in his <hi>Synopſis,</hi> and other learned Men obſerve) ſignifies the Strength &amp; Sufficiency of God, <q>It ſpeaks (ſays <hi>Henery</hi>) the Almighty Power of God, either as an Avenger, or as a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, but it ſhould be eſpecially taken in the Latter Senſe.</q> as <hi>Druſius</hi> and others obſerve. In which it ſignifies God's <hi>Self-Sufficiency,</hi> and <hi>All-Sufficiency.</hi> He is able to perform all that he hath ſaid, reſpecting his People, he hath enough in himſelf, and of himſelf, for himſelf and for them; he hath all Things, and needeth nothing to compleat his own Perfection and Bleſſedneſs, and is able to confer on us a Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:005500_0217_103965F8A5248798"/>
as large as our Deſires, and as laſting as our Souls. And therefore this Word, ſeems to be better rendred in the old Engliſh <hi>Verſion,</hi> than in the preſent: For there it is thus expreſs'd. <hi>I am God all ſufficient.</hi> But</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. The Words of our Text inform us, what God <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects</hi> or <hi>requires</hi> his <hi>People to be to him.</hi> And this is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd in two Particulars, <hi>viz. Walking before him,</hi> and in <hi>being perfect. Walk before me.</hi> This Word by a Metaphor intends Men's Lives and Actions, (<hi>Pſ.</hi> i. 1.) Becauſe there is ſome Analogy or Reſemblance between them, and a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Way. <hi>Before me,</hi> i. e. Under a continual Senſe of my Preſence and Cognizance, as a Servant before his Lord. <hi>And be thou perfect. Simmachus</hi> renders the Word <hi>perfect,</hi> blameleſs, but according to the moſt of Interpreters, it ſignifies, Sincerity or Freedom from Deceit and Guile; and in this Senſe it is aſcrib'd to <hi>Abram, Noah, David</hi> and <hi>Job. (Gen.</hi> vi. 9. <hi>Pſ.</hi> xviii. 23. <hi>Job</hi> i. 1.) That is perfect in the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>'s Judgment, which hath all its Parts, tho' it be not perfect in Degrees. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> iii. 17. <hi>That the Man of God, may be perfect thoroughly furniſhed to all good Works.</hi> And ſuch as are more advanc'd in Knowledge and Holineſs than others, are call'd perfect <hi>comparatively. Phil.</hi> iii. 15. <hi>Let us therefore as many as be perfect, be thus minded.</hi> God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty therefore does not covenant with <hi>Abram,</hi> for an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Perfection of Degrees, as the Papiſts dream, who are herein follow'd by the whole Tribe of Enthuſiaſts; but he requires a Perfection of Parts, or Sincerity. <hi>viz.</hi> That he ſhould endeavour to conform his Practice, to all Parts of the divine Law, without Guile or reſerve. <q>I know no Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (ſaid excellent Mr. <hi>Mathew Henery</hi>) but <hi>Sincerity.</hi>

            <p>In diſcourſing upon this Text I ſhall ſpeak upon the three following Heads, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <pb n="215" facs="unknown:005500_0218_103965F707D4A768"/>
               <item>I. The Sufficiency of God.</item>
               <item>II. Walking before him.</item>
               <item>III. Sincerity.</item>
            </list>
            <p>And then apply the whole. The</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. General Head of Diſcourſe is God's <hi>Sufficiency, or All Sufficiency,</hi> which may be thus deſcrib'd, <hi>viz. That it is a Perfection of the divine Nature whereby Johovah hath enough in himſelf, for himſelf, and for his People in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</hi> This reſults from his Infinity in particular, as well as from his other Attributes in general, becauſe he exiſted not by the Will of another, therefore he is independent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite in his Eſſence and in all his Attributes and Being, ſo he muſt be conſequently perfect and all ſufficient. As his Simplicity aſſures us, that he can admit nothing of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kind, to perfect his Being, ſo his Eternity informs us, that he was happy in himſelf, when there was none beſides him. And ſeeing all the Excellencies of Creatures are deriv'd from him, he muſt poſſeſs the ſame eminently in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, otherwiſe he could not confer them upon others. Hence is that Beautiful Paſſage of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſ.</hi> xxxvi. 10. <hi>With thee is the Fountain of Life, and in thy Light ſhall we ſee Light. Theophilact</hi> gloſſeth pertinently upon this Place of Scripture in the following Manner. <q>As the Sun <hi>(ſays he)</hi> is alway<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> beheld full, and never leſſened as the Moon, ſo God always exiſts perfect, full of Wiſdom, Power, Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallity and all other good Things.</q> And the Scriptures aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert elſewhere, <hi>that God is perfect,</hi> Mat. v. 48. <hi>Perfect in Wiſdom, Power, Beneficence, and that he needs Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil or Help of none.</hi> Job. xxii. 2, 3 Rom. xi. 34, 35.</p>
            <p>But that the aforeſaid Deſcription of God's Sufficiency may be the better underſtood, let the following Particulars be conſider'd.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="216" facs="unknown:005500_0219_103965F583B6A348"/>1ſt. That the general Nature of this Attribute is <hi>Fullneſs,</hi> or enough of Excellency and Good. This is a Perfection oppos'd to Emptineſs and Defect, and is attended with the following Properties. <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. It is an <hi>underiv'd Fullneſs</hi> Rom. xi. 35, 36. <hi>Who hath firſt given to him, and it ſhall be recompenſed to him again, for of him, and through him, and to him are all Things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly. It is an <hi>independent Fullneſs:</hi> He hath no Depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon Creatures, neither can he receive any Good or Excellency from them, becauſe they have deriv'd their All from him. Now a Circulation of Cauſes and Effects is in the nature of Things impoſſible. <hi>Our Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs extends not to him, neither is it any Gain to the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that we are righteous,</hi> ſayeth Job. <hi>Who hath made thee to differ from another,</hi> ſayeth the Apoſtle Paul? <hi>And what haſt thou that thou didſt not receive?</hi> It was a noble ſaying of the Pagan <hi>Lucretius,</hi> reſpecting the divine Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ipſa ſuis valens opibus non indiga Noſtri.</hi> Which may be thus Engliſhed.</p>
            <q>
               <l>
                  <hi>Jehovah</hi>'s Wealth, does fully him ſuffice,</l>
               <l>Nor needs he, of his Creatures, a ſupply.</l>
            </q>
            <p n="3">3dly. It is a <hi>compleat</hi> and <hi>perfect Fullneſs,</hi> and that in three reſpects, <hi>viz.</hi> In regard of the Kinds, Degrees and Duration of all poſſible Excellency and Good. And 1ſt. the <hi>Fulneſs</hi> of God is Perfect in reſpect of the <hi>Kinds</hi> of Excellency, for the Almighty hath in him, not only all thoſe Excellencies, the Shadow of which is in created Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſuch as <hi>Wiſdom, Power, Holineſs, Juſtice, Goodneſs, Truth.</hi> But he hath alſo ſuch Excellency's in his Nature as there are no Footſteps or reſemblance of in Creatures, <hi>e. g. Simplicity, Immutability, Infinity, Incomprehenſibility,</hi> and <hi>Self-exiſtence.</hi> Which are therefore term'd by ſome Divines incommunicable Attributes! And</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="217" facs="unknown:005500_0220_103965F3A711B968"/>2dly. The <hi>Fullneſs</hi> of God is compleat and perfect in <hi>Degree,</hi> becauſe Infinite. The Excellencies of the nobleſt Creatures are limited and finite; but thoſe of <hi>Jehovah</hi> are without Bounds. The Almighty Poſſeſſes all the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of created Beings in a more ſublime and exalted Degree, than can poſſibly be attain'd by them, becauſe of their finite Natures. But</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. The <hi>Fullneſs</hi> of God is compleat and perfect in reſpect of <hi>Duration,</hi> the Excellencies of Creatures are Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities diſtinct from, and added to their Beings, and may be therefore ſeperated and extinguiſhed, while their Beings are preſerved, as appears by the doleful Apoſtacy of the Angels and our firſt Parents. If their Beings themſelves, becauſe deriv'd and dependant, may be deſtroy'd, how much more the good Properties that cleave thereto? But the Full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God is the very ſame with his Being, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inſeparable and eternal! He and he only is, <hi>Wiſdom, Juſtice, Goodneſs,</hi> and <hi>Truth.</hi> But to proceed</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. The <hi>Fullneſs</hi> of God is <hi>Invariable,</hi> equally unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Addition or Diminution, he can receive nothing from without, becauſe he is already Infinite, and to that nothing can be added. And from whom ſhould he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any Addition, it muſt be from Creatures if at all; but they can give him nothing but what is his own, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what they received from him, Acts xvii. 25. <hi>Neither is he worſhiped with Men's Hands, as tho' he needed any Thing, ſeeing he giveth to all Life, and Breath, and all Things!</hi> And as the Fullneſs of God cannot be increaſed, ſo neither can it be impair'd by the ſordid Violence of Creatures! For as our Goodneſs does not extend to God to benefit him, ſo neither can our Impieties do him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny real Injury, Job xxxv. 6, 7, 8, <hi>If thou ſinneſt, what doeſt thou againſt him? Or if thy Tranſgreſſions be multiply'd,
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:005500_0221_103965F224C43B40"/>
what doſt thou unto him? If thou be Righteous what giveſt thou him? Or what receiveth he of thine Hand? Thy Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may hurt a Man, as thou art, and thy Righteouſneſs may profit the Son of Man!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5thly. The <hi>Fullneſs</hi> of God is <hi>Overflowing</hi> and <hi>Immenſe:</hi> He has more than enough for all created Beings, the Riches and Affluence thereof, not only exceeds all their Neceſſities, but even their Thoughts and Deſires! Eph. iii. 20. <hi>Now unto him who is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we aſk or think.</hi> Pſal. xxxvi. 8. <hi>They ſhall be abundantly ſatisfy'd with the Fatneſs of thy Houſe, and thou ſhalt make them drink of the River of thy Pleaſures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6thly. The <hi>Fullneſs</hi> of God is <hi>Everflowing</hi> and <hi>Inexhauſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:</hi> The Ciſterns of created Good may be drawn dry; but God is a Fountain that cannot be exhauſted: He is the <hi>Alpha,</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the Beginning and the Ending from Everlaſting to Everlaſting, God. When Millions have drank of this Fountain the Streams are never the Leſs.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>ſpecial Nature</hi> of Gods <hi>Sufficiency</hi> appears in theſe two Particulars following, <hi>viz.</hi> 1ſt. In that <hi>Jehovah</hi> hath enough in himſelf for himſelf, or his own Happineſs; In this reſpect he is call'd <hi>Self-Sufficient.</hi> That God is Happy, appears from the Character of <hi>Bleſſed</hi> frequently aſcrib'd to him in Scripture. What is Happineſs but the Enjoyment of a ſufficient Degree of Good, ſuited to the Nature of the Being that enjoys it? Now it is certain the Almighty hath this, for he neither needeth, deſireth, or can receive more than he has. Dependant Creatures need a foreign Support to ſuſtain their borrow'd Beings; but he is independent and hath Life of himſelf, (<hi>Joh.</hi> v. 26) And therefore needs them not, neither doth he deſire more Happineſs then he hath; for than he would be imperfect and ſo no God. Before the Worlds Foundations were laid
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:005500_0222_103965F0A1733798"/>
he had Complaiſance in his own Glory and Perfection; neither did he make Creatures to increaſe his own Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, but of meer good Pleaſure: And as for Creatures acknowledging of his Excellency with Honour, it adds no more thereto than commending the Sun adds to its Luſtre, or praiſing a Fountain would increaſe its Streams, neither can the Almighty poſſibly receive any more Happineſs than he hath becauſe of his Infinity. To confirm and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate what has been now obſerv'd let the following Places of Scripture be conſidered, Pſ. l. 9, 13. <hi>I will take no Bullock out of thy Houſe, nor He-Goats out of thy Fold: For every Beaſt of the Foreſt is mine, and the Cattle upon a thouſand Hills. If I were Hungry I would not tell thee, for the World is mine and the Fullneſs thereof.</hi> And</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. The Almighty hath enough for all his Creatures to make them compleatly Happy: <hi>I am the Almighty God.</hi> Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> in his <hi>Synopſis</hi> obſerves <q>The Original Word is deriv'd of a Root that ſignifies a Breaſt, becauſe he nouriſhes all, for the ſame Reaſon the Heathens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented their <hi>Diana, Iſis and Ceres</hi> after the ſame Manner.</q> The Ability of God to make all his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Happy, is juſtly term'd by Divines, his All-Suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, and this in Relation to good People is ſet forth by ſeveral ſignificant Emblems or Similitudes. Hence he is call'd a <hi>Sun</hi> (Pſa. lxxxiv. 12.) As the Sun diſſipates the Gloom of Night by his enlightning and warming Rays, and thereby ſheds a Gladneſs over the Face of Things; thus the Almighty refreſheth his Peoples Hearts. The Lord is likewiſe call'd his Peoples Shield, Pſa. lxxxiv. They are expos'd in this tumultuous Scene to a thick Succeſſion of Dangers and Conflicts; but the Almighty protects them as by a Shield, <hi>He covers their Head in the Day of Battle. He that dwelleth in the ſecret Place of the moſt High, ſhall
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:005500_0223_103965EED783BEB0"/>
abide under the Shadow of the Almighty.</hi> The Almighty is call'd his Peoples <hi>Rock, Strength</hi> and <hi>Deliverer.</hi> He beſtows all Manner of ſpiritual and temporal Good upon them, (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> i. 3.) He abundantly recompences all their Services and Sufferings for him; and hence he is call'd <hi>an exceeding great Reward,</hi> Gen. xv. i. Phil. iv. 19. <hi>My God ſhall ſupply all your Need, according to his Riches in Glory by</hi> JESUS CHRIST. Particularly</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. There is enough in God to ſupply his Peoples Wants here: Enough 1ſt for <hi>Protection,</hi> Zech. ii. 5. <hi>For I, ſaith the Lord, will be a Wall of Fire unto her, round about, and will be the Glory in the midſt of her.</hi> Zech. ix. 12. <hi>Turn ye to the ſtrong Hold, ye Priſoners of Hope.</hi> Pſa. lxiii. 7. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt been my Help therefore in the Shadow of thy Wings will I rejoyce:</hi> Hence the Lord bids his People, <hi>not to fear for I am with thee, be not diſmay'd for I am thy God: I will ſtrengthen thee, yea I will help thee, yea I will uphold thee with the right Hand of my Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,—Fear not thou Worm</hi> Jacob, <hi>and ye Men of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>I will help thee ſayeth the Lord,</hi> Iſa. xli. 10—14. And does not <hi>Jehovah</hi> promiſe, that <hi>no Evil ſhall come nigh their dwelling,</hi> Pſa. xci. And was it not in Confidence of this Almighty Protection that the triumphant <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſays, Pſal. xlvi. and elſewhere, <hi>That tho' Mountains were toſs'd into the midſt of the Sea, and ten Thouſand roſe up againſt him, he would not be afraid.</hi> But</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. There is enough in God for <hi>Proviſion,</hi> Pſa. xxiii. <hi>The Lord is my Shepherd I ſhall not want.</hi> Hence the Almighty graciouſly promiſes to make his Peoples Bread and Water ſure.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. <hi>Enough</hi> for <hi>Honour,</hi> Pſa. iii. 3. <hi>But thou O Lord art a ſhield for me, my Glory and the lifter up of mine Head.</hi> God is the Fountain and Original of all true Honour.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="221" facs="unknown:005500_0224_103965ED15717C98"/>4thly. Enough for <hi>Pleaſures,</hi> for his loving Kindneſs, is as Marrow and Fatneſs that yields a rational and ſubſtantial Delight, <hi>yea he is far better than Life itſelf,</hi> Job xxii. 26. <hi>For then ſhalt thou have thy Delight in the Almighty, and ſhalt lift up thy Face unto God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5thly. Enough for <hi>Guidance,</hi> Pſa. xxxii. 8. <hi>I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct thee and teach thee in the Way which thou ſhalt go,</hi> I <hi>will guide thee with mine Eye.</hi> Is not <hi>Jehovah Wiſdom it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> and <hi>wonderful in Council,</hi> as well as excellent in Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? (Iſa. xxviii. 29.)</p>
            <p n="6">6thly. Enough for <hi>Sanctification,</hi> for with him is the Reſidue of the Spirit. Enough for <hi>Society,</hi> 1 John i. 3. <hi>That which we have ſeen and heard, declare we unto you, that ye alſo may have Fellowſhip with us: And truly our Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip is with the Father, and with his Son</hi> JESUS CHRIST. Enough for <hi>Example,</hi> Ephe. v. 1. <hi>Be ye therefore Followers of God as dear Children.</hi> Enough for <hi>Reward,</hi> Gen. xv. 1. <hi>Fear not Abram, I am thy Shield, and exceeding great Reward.</hi> But</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. There is enough in God to ſatisfy the <hi>Deſires</hi> of his People here and hereafter, Jer. 31.14. And <hi>I will Satiate the Soul of the Prieſts with Fatneſs, and my People ſhall be ſatisfied with my Goodneſs, ſayeth the Lord.</hi> Pſa. xvii. ult. <hi>As for me I will behold thy Face in Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I ſhall be ſatisfied when I awake with thy Likeneſs.</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah makes over himſelf in Covenant to his People as All-ſufficient, thus he did to <hi>Abram</hi> in our Text. Hence it is ſaid, Pſal. xxxiv. <hi>That tho' the young Lyons may ſuffer Hunger, yet thoſe that fear the Lord ſhall not lack any Good.</hi> Hoſ. xiv. 5, 6, 7. <hi>I will be as the Dew unto</hi> Iſrael, <hi>he ſhall grow as the Lilly, and caſt forth his Root as Lebanon. His Branches ſhall ſpread, and his Beauty ſhall be as the Olive Tree, and his ſmell as Lebanon. They that dwell
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:005500_0225_103965EB93136C40"/>
under his Shadow, ſhall revive as the Corn, and grow as the Vine. The Scent thereof ſhall be as the Wine of Lebanon.</hi> The People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſs had neither Bread nor Water, Proviſion nor Protection, yet having an all ſufficient God they wanted none of thoſe Things, Deut. xxxiii. 26,—28. <hi>There is none like the God of</hi> Jeſhurun <hi>who rideth upon the Heaven in thy Help, and in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency on the Sky: The eternal God is thy Refuge and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath are the Everlaſting Arms.</hi>—Iſrael <hi>then ſhall dwell in ſafety alone, the Fountain of</hi> Jacob <hi>ſhall be upon a Land of Corn and Wine, alſo his Heavens ſhall drop down Dew. Happy art thou O</hi> Iſrael, <hi>who is like unto thee O Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſaved by the Lord, the Shield of thy Help, and who is the Sword of thy Excellency.</hi> But I proceed to the</p>
            <p n="2">2d. General Head, which was to <hi>diſcourſe upon the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of walking before God,</hi> which may be thus deſcrib'd, viz. <hi>That it is a friendly Converſation with God:</hi> Now this is expreſſed by different Phraſes in Scripture, ſometimes it is call'd a <hi>walking before God,</hi> as in the Text, to ſignify the Senſe that we ſhould always have of God's Preſence upon our Minds. Sometimes a <hi>walking after God</hi> to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port our Need of imitating his Example, and of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating ourſelves to his various Dealings with us, whether Comfortable or Afflictive, (<hi>Deut.</hi> xiii. 4.) Some times it is call'd a <hi>walking with God,</hi> thus it is ſaid of <hi>Enoch, that he walked with God;</hi> this Phraſe eſpecially intends that ſweet Familiarity which paſſes between God and holy Souls. Sometimes it is called a <hi>Walking in the Name of God, (Mica.</hi> iv. 5.) to ſignify that in all our religious Practice, we ſhould have the divine Preſcription for our <hi>Rule,</hi> and the divine Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for our <hi>Mark.</hi> Sometimes a <hi>Walking</hi> in the <hi>Spirit, (Gal.</hi> v. 16.) importing the Senſe we ſhould always have of our Need of the Guidance and Aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt to
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:005500_0226_103965E9EFE4B630"/>
the Performance of acceptable Service, as well as our intire Dependance thereupon. But more particularly</p>
            <p>Walking before or with God, ſuppoſes and implies theſe Things following, <hi>viz,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. <hi>Reconciliation</hi> to God by accepting the Mediator through Faith: <hi>For how ſhall two walk together except they be agreed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly. It ſuppoſes <hi>ſpiritual Life,</hi> infus'd by Regeneration, for a dead Man cannot walk.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. It <hi>ſuppoſes</hi> the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> or Grace, by the quickning Operations of the Holy Spirit. A Man cannot walk that is aſleep. <hi>I will run the Ways of thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> ſaid the <hi>Pſalmiſt, when thou haſt enlarged my Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4thly. It ſuppoſes <hi>a Way</hi> in which, and this is twofold <hi>viz.</hi> either of God's <hi>Commands,</hi> or of his <hi>Providence,</hi> we muſt obey the Former and accommodate our ſelves to the Latter, <hi>i. e.</hi> When the Almighty frowns by Afflictions, we muſt mourn, and when he ſmiles by Comforts communicated we muſt rejoyce. And</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. It ſuppoſes an <hi>End</hi> to which, and this ought to be ever the ſame with what <hi>Jehovah</hi> intends, <hi>viz.</hi> The Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of his Glory; and in Subordination thereto our own and our Neighbours Happineſs. <hi>Whether in eating or drinking or whatſoever we do, we ſhould do it all to the Glory of God.</hi> But</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. Walking before or with God <hi>implies</hi> theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Particulars, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. <hi>Faith,</hi> he that walks with God, as well as comes to him, muſt believe that he is. In walking with God, <hi>Faith</hi> is neceſſary in three Reſpects. 1ſt. As an <hi>Eye</hi> to behold the great Prophet of the Church, the Guide of our Way, without whoſe Command we muſt not move a Foot, in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Deſart who ſtopp'd <hi>when the
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:005500_0227_103965E7E006CE88"/>
Pillar of a Cloud and of Fire did not go before them.</hi> 2dly. As a <hi>Conduit</hi> to convey Proviſion and Refreſhment in our Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, without which we muſt needs travel ſlowly and heavily. 3dly. As a <hi>Hand</hi> to help us to lay hold of, and lean upon the dear Redeemer in our Walking. Hence it is with Admiration obſerv'd concerning the Church, <hi>Cant.</hi> viii. 5. <hi>Who is this that cometh out of the Wilderneſs leaning upon the Beloved.</hi> Except we rely upon the Strength of God, we cannot walk with him. But</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. Walking before God, implies <hi>Fear,</hi> our Minds ſhould be continually poſſeſſed with an awful Reverence of God's Majeſty, as remembring the infinite Diſtance between him and us, in point of Dignity. Likewiſe we ſhould be ever afraid of offending God, and humbly jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of our own Hearts. Hence we are bid to <hi>ſerve God acceptably with Reverence &amp; Godly Fear.</hi> Heb. xii. 28, 29. And hence is that divine Expoſtulation. <hi>Mal.</hi> i. 6. <hi>If I be a Maſter where is my Fear?</hi> And</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. It implies <hi>Love</hi> to God, and Familiarity with him thereby. Such as behold by Faith the Amiableneſs of the divine Majeſty, and taſte his Love, love him again with a ſupream and tranſcendent reſpect! As Fear ballances Love ſo Love ſweetens Fear. <q>Fear without Love would be a painful Paſſion (<hi>as Dr.</hi> Bates <hi>juſtly obſerves</hi>) and Love without Fear would degenerate into an effeminate Fondneſs.</q> Now that Familiarity which ſubſiſts between God and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers by Love, contains in it theſe Things following, 1ſt. <hi>mutal Viſits,</hi> as God viſits his People by his Grace, ſo they viſit him with Repentance, Prayers and Tears. (<hi>Jam.</hi> iv. 2.) <hi>Mutual Embraces, (Cant.</hi> i. 2, 3.) A <hi>mutual Communication</hi> of Secrets. God opens ſecret Things to them. Hence the Secret of the Lord is ſaid to be with thoſe that fear him, (<hi>Pſ.</hi> xxv. 14.) And the People of God on the other Hand,
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:005500_0228_103965E659C6A5E8"/>
come to him, as a Father, and ſob after him <hi>Abba Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and open to him all their Hearts. (<hi>Pſ.</hi> xlii. 4.) A <hi>mutual Deſire of Union</hi> and <hi>Cohabitation.</hi> Hence CHRIST ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſts his Bride in the following Strains. <hi>Come with me from</hi> Lebanon <hi>my Siſter my Spouſe, look from the Top of</hi> Amana, <hi>from the Top of</hi> Shenir <hi>and</hi> Hermon <hi>from the Lyons Dens and from the Mountains of Leopards.</hi> And the Spouſe on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hand ſays, <hi>Come</hi> LORD JESUS <hi>come quickly; I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to he diſſolv'd and to be with</hi> CHRIST <hi>which is far better.</hi> 5thly. A <hi>friendly Conſultation</hi> for Advice and Direction. Hence the dear Redeemer is call'd <hi>his Peoples Counſellor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he leads them by his Council, (Iſa.</hi> ix. 6.) But</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. <hi>Walking before or with God implies Pains</hi> and <hi>Labour,</hi> natural Walking, to which this alludes, is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, eſpecially if it be for a conſiderable Space. And hence we are bid to ſtrive <hi>to enter in at the ſtrait Gate, and work out our Salvation with fear and trembling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5thly. It implies <hi>Progreſs,</hi> thoſe that walk in a natural Road make Progreſs, and thus thoſe that walk with God grow more humble, more weaned from this World, and more reſign'd to God's Will, and it is doubtleſs in general their chief Deſire, and endeavour to grow in Grace, and when they find not thus, it is their principal Grief.</p>
            <p n="6">6thly It implies <hi>Perſeverance,</hi> for walking is not a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Act, but a Courſe and Series of them, a continuance in our religious Diligence, until we come to the End of our Race, it is thoſe only who <hi>perſevere to the End, that ſhall be ſaved.</hi> We <hi>ſhould run ſo as to obtain.</hi> But I proceed to the</p>
            <p n="3">3d. General Head of Diſcourſe, <hi>viz. Sincerity,</hi> which may be thus deſcrib'd, <hi>viz. That it is a divine Vertue,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we really are, <hi>what we ſeem to be.</hi> Here an appearance
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:005500_0229_103965E496B53B80"/>
of Goodneſs is ſuppos'd, and theſe Things following are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, which conſtitute <hi>Sincerity,</hi> viz.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. That a Perſon labours to avoid all mixture of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and evil Intention; this is by our Lord call'd <hi>a ſingle Eye,</hi> and when Perſons have this, then their <hi>whole Bodies are full of Light,</hi> i. e. they are in a gracious and comfortable State.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. When Perſons habitually labour not only outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but chiefly inwardly, to be Holy contrary to the Practice of the Phariſees, who <hi>cleanſed the outſide of the Cup and Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter while the Inſide was neglected.</hi> And</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. When Men endeavour to be Holy, not only before Men, but chiefly before God, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> iii. 22. <hi>Not with Eye Service as Men Pleaſers, but with ſingleneſs of Heart fearing God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4thly. When Men do not habitually neglect known Duty, and expect not their Reward from Men, but from God, thus it is ſaid of <hi>Zachariah</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth, That they walk'd in all the Commandments of God blameleſs.</hi> It is likewiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded of <hi>Moſes, (Heb.</hi> xi. 27.) That by Faith he forſook <hi>Egypt,</hi> not fearing the Wrath of the King, for he endur'd, as ſeeing him who is inviſible.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Sincerity</hi> is twofold, <hi>viz. Moral</hi> or <hi>Spiritual. Moral</hi> is that which ſprings from Nature, poliſhed by a religious Education, together with reſtraining Grace; and principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aims at our own Intereſt. Such an Integrity had the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan <hi>Abimelech,</hi> and altho' this be not ſaving, yet it is the Way to obtain Mercy, and is of great Uſe in civil Society. It were to be wiſh'd that more meant as they ſpoke than do: But ſpiritual Sincerity follows after Converſion, &amp; aims chiefly at the Glory of God, above all. And it is either Imperfect, or Perfect. The Former is when, for the moſt Part Upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hath the Aſcendant, tho' attended with Struggle and
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:005500_0230_103965E3137C7AC8"/>
Combat. The Latter is when we are entirely free from all corrupt Intention, which is the Priviledge of the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> and not of the Way, when that which is Perfect is come, then that which is in Part ſhall be done away.</p>
            <p>But it will not be improper to add to what hath been ſaid, the following Marks of <hi>Sincerity,</hi> viz. 1ſt. If we do not cover and hide our Sins, but confeſs them and forſake them. 2dly. If we avoid all appearance of Evil, both as to Principle and Practice. 3dly. If in Proſperity, as well as in Adverſity, we cleave inviolably to the Truths and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Religion. 4thly. If in the Abſence as well as Preſence of Spectators, we endeavour to be Holy. 5thly. If we have the Light of God's Word, and are willing to have our States and Actions tried the reby. 6thly. If we are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of, and bewail the Remains of Hypocriſy that are in us, as the poor Man that cried <hi>Lord, I believe, help my Unbelief.</hi> But I proceed to the Application of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. And</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. What has been ſaid concerning God's Sufficiency, ſerves to inform us, how great the Portion of every Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is. It exceeds in Worth and Dignity, Millions of Worlds. The Lord himſelf is the <hi>Portion of their Inheritance and of their Cup! Their Lines have fallen to them in pleaſant Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they have a goodly Heritage!</hi> In having God they have more than all beſides him, yea infinitely more. <q>If the greateſt Princes ſhould bring all their Treaſures, <hi>(ſays Biſhop Hopkins)</hi> the pooreſt Chriſtian can produce a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that will beggar them all.</q> Juſtly then may the Church glory in him, <hi>Lam.</hi> iii. 24. <hi>The Lord is my Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſayeth my Soul, therefore will I hope in him! This is my Beloved, and this is my Friend! O Daughters of Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly. The <hi>All-Sufficiency</hi> of God, may convince us of the In-ſufficiency and Vanity of all Creatures, <hi>Ecleſ.</hi> i. 1.
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:005500_0231_103965E14A0F3DB8"/>
               <hi>Vanity of Vanities ſaith the Preacher, Vanity of Vanities all is Vanity!</hi> If God only be abſolutely Perfect and All-Sufficient, then every Creature is of it ſelf imperfect, and vain, becauſe of itſelf it has no Perfection, by which it can ſuffice itſelf or others, <hi>Jer.</hi> ii. 13. <hi>They are all broken Ciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns that can hold no Water!</hi> And if the Creature had any Sufficiency, it could be of no Service, unleſs apply'd and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by the firſt mover: If the Caſe be ſo, why ſhould we doat upon them, or confide in them? Or why ſhould we fear them, or immoderately bewail the loſs of them! And</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. We may hence learn the Folly of ſuch, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake God for the Creature. <hi>Jer.</hi> ii. 13. <hi>My People have committed two Evils, they have forſaken the Fountain of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Waters, and hewn out to themſelves Ciſterns, broken Ciſterns, that can hold no Water!</hi> Surely ſuch as purſue ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Vanities, forſake their own Mercies! And this they muſt expect, as their Reward, to be diſappointed in their Expectations, to be ſnar'd in the Work of their own Hands and at laſt to lye down in Sorrow! But</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. The All-Sufficiency of God miniſters ſtrong Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, to all that are ſincere, and walk with God. Now whether we be indeed ſuch, we may know by comparing our ſelves diligently and impartially with what has been before obſerv'd, on theſe Heads. What tho' we cannot ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice ourſelves, and what tho' all the World can't ſuffice us, this is no great Wonder: For the Soul of Man is endowed with an inſatiable Deſire: Well, but there is an All-Suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent God, who can ſuffice both himſelf and us! And this is, or ſhould be, all our Salvation, and all our Deſire. The Conſideration of God's All-Sufficiency may be a ſweet Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to us in all Manner of Diſtreſſes, whether of <hi>Mind, Body</hi> or <hi>Eſtate.</hi> Whether of Spiritual or Temporal Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, God is our Sun, our Shield and Buckler, who ſuffices
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:005500_0232_103965DF929A0238"/>
himſelf, and therefore can much more ſatisfy us, who need not ſo great Perfection. This Almighty God hath made many and gracious Promiſes, that he will be every where and evermore preſent with his People, and eſpecially in the Mount of Difficulty! Of whom then, or of what ſhould we be afraid? What is the Want that <hi>All-Sufficiency</hi> cannot ſupply, what is the Strait, that <hi>All-Sufficiency</hi> cannot ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount? <hi>David</hi> took encouragement from this Attribute, when he was in ſore Diſtreſs at <hi>Ziglag,</hi> when the Town was ſack'd, his Wives taken Captive, and himſelf like to be ſtoned to Death (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xxx. 6.) And it was this that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged <hi>Abram</hi> againſt all human Probability, to expect the Fulfilment of the divine Promiſe, concerning a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Poſterity. (<hi>Heb.</hi> xi. 19.) And</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. The aforeſaid Subject, ſerves to reprove all thoſe, who practically deny the <hi>All-Sufficiency</hi> of God; which is done 1ſt. By the Prophane, who having abandoned the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſerve divers Luſts and Pleaſures (<hi>Mal.</hi> 3.14.) 2dly. Secret Hypocrites, who tho' they abound in outward Acts of Obedience, yet will not <hi>give to God their whole Hearts,</hi> and that for this Reaſon, becauſe there be ſome Things which they look upon as neceſſary and profitable which they don't expect from God, and them they are reſolv'd to have from Creatures either Right or Wrong. (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> ii. 4, 5.) And 3dly. Even the Regenerate themſelves are liable to this Evil, of denying practically, the <hi>All-Sufficiency</hi> of God. Now this is done in the following Inſtances.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. When we uſe unlawful or deceitful Meaſures to attain what we think we can't get from God by lawful ones. An Example of this Kind we have in <hi>Jacob,</hi> reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Birth-Right. And</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. When we uſe unlawful Methods to eſcape immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Dangers. Thus <hi>David</hi> feign'd himſelf mad before King
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:005500_0233_103965DDED400BA0"/>
               <hi>Achiſh,</hi> and <hi>Abram</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> denied their Wives for fear they ſhould be ſlain on their Account. And</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. When we inordinately love Creatures, and imagine ſomething to be in them which is not in God, on this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count Covetouſneſs is call'd Idolatry. (<hi>Eph.</hi> v. 5.)</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. When we vainly confide in Creatures, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ourſelves ſomething from them, which we ſuppoſe the Almighty either cannot or will not confer. (<hi>Pſ.</hi> lxii. 9, 10.)</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. When we murmur at our preſent Condition, and deſire it to be otherwiſe than God has alotted it! This Diſcontent was the Occaſion both of the fall of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and our firſt Parents.</p>
            <p n="6">6thly. When we diſtruſt God's Power, Promiſes, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, with <hi>Moſes, Num.</hi> xi. 13, 14. <hi>Whence ſhould I have Fleſh to give unto all this People?</hi> With <hi>David</hi> 1 Sam. xxvii. 1. Who ſaid in his Heart, <hi>that he ſhould one Day pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh by the Hand of</hi> Saul. With <hi>Sarah,</hi> Gen. xviii. 12. Who when ſhe was told that ſhe ſhould have a Child in old Age, laughed through diſtruſt, which was diſpleaſing to God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it reflected upon his All-Sufficiency v. 13, 14. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto</hi> Abram, <hi>wherefore did</hi> Sarah <hi>laugh, is any Thing too hard for the Lord?</hi> With <hi>Gideon,</hi> who tho' he had the expreſs Command of God to war with the <hi>Midia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi> and a promiſe of Victory over them, yet heſitating ſays, <hi>Judg.</hi> vi. 15. <hi>O Lord wherewith ſhall I ſave them, for my Family is poor in</hi> Manaſſeh; and therefore he asked a Sign And</p>
            <p n="7">7thly. When we decline great Services, being thereto call'd by God, on account of pretended Unfitneſs,—With <hi>Moſes; Ex.</hi> iii. 11. <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaid unto God, who am I that I ſhould go unto</hi> Pharaoh?—<hi>And bring forth the Children of Iſrael out of</hi> Egypt. And with <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> who being call'd to publick Service, for God, excus'd himſelf thus, <hi>behold I cannot
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:005500_0234_103965DC202B3EA8"/>
ſpeak for I am a Child.</hi> Now the aforeſaid practical Deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of Gods All-Sufficiency involves in it Idolatry, and ſome degree of Apoſtacy; for thereby we turn from him to them, and expect from them, what we ſuppoſe is not in him; as this Evil obſtructs the Courſe of God's Favour to us, ſo it expoſes us to the dreadful Judgments of God. Hence it is ſaid, that JESUS could do no mighty Works among a certain People, becauſe of their Unbelief. And hence we read (2 <hi>Kings</hi> vii. 17.) of a Lord who would not believe <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s Propheſies of Plenty in <hi>Samaria,</hi> and was troden to Death in the Preſs! And was not <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> upon this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count depriv'd of the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Canaan? (Num.</hi> xx. 12.)</p>
            <p>Now from the Conſideration of God's <hi>All-Sufficiency,</hi> we ſhould be exhorted to the following Duties, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. To <hi>glorify God</hi> on this Account, with all our Souls, ſeeing that this is the Foundation of all his Glory and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. If we ſhould glorify God, becauſe of every of his Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, how much more on the Account, of this which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes them all. And</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. To enter into Covenant with him, by accepting of CHRIST, the Angel of the Covenant by a living Faith, <hi>Who is the Way to his Father,</hi> in whom we have Boldneſs of acceſs with Confidence by the Faith of him. In him all the Promiſes are <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen.</hi> And thus the <hi>All-Sufficiency</hi> of God will be ours, and without this it will profit us nothing; but on the contrary be engag'd againſt us. This Duty of Covenanting with God, our Text and Context points to. <hi>I am the Almighty God, walk before me and be thou perfect: and I will make my Covenant between me and thee.</hi> And</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. We ſhould be exhorted to Contentedneſs with our Lot, and to Beneficence towards others, in Imitation of the <hi>All-Sufficiency</hi> of God, in which our chief Excellency con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="232" facs="unknown:005500_0235_103965DA5F9FC788"/>4thly. We ſhould love the <hi>All-Sufficient</hi> God above all, purſue after him with the ſtrongeſt Deſire, and reſt in him with the ſweeteſt Complacency! ſeeing he is enough for us, and infinitely more than ſo in all reſpects! <hi>Pſ.</hi> xviii. 1, 2, 3. <hi>I will love thee O Lord my Srength, my Rock, my Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs and my Deliverer, my Buckler and the Horn of my Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5thly. We ſhould put our entire Confidence in him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he alone is All in All, Light to the Mind, Goodneſs to the Will, Order to the Affections, Gladneſs to the Heart, and Joy to the whole Soul, and Beauty and Immortality to the Body.</p>
            <p n="6">6thly. We ſhould hope in this <hi>All-Sufficient</hi> God in all Adverſity, whether perſonal or publick, what tho' Clouds and Darkneſs hang over the Horizon of the viſible Church, and the Hand of Pride ſcatters her Aſſemblies, and ſtains her Glory, yet we muſt not faint or fear, ſeeing ſhe has an <hi>All-Sufficient</hi> Protector. Surely ſhe is built upon a ſtable <hi>Rock, againſt which the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail.</hi> God in his own Time will make <hi>Edom</hi> deſolate, and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a praiſe in the Earth. And</p>
            <p n="7">7thly, While we compare our Emptineſs with the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty's Fullneſs we ſhould be humbled in the Duſt, and ſay with <hi>Eliphaz, Job</hi> iv. 17, 19. <hi>Shall Mortal Man be more juſt than God, ſhall a Man be more pure than his Maker, behold he put no Truſt in his Servants, and his Angels he charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Folly, how much leſs on them who dwell in Houſes of Clay, whoſe Foundation is in the Duſt, who are cruſhed before the Moth!</hi> It is a noble ſaying of <hi>Gregory</hi> 
               <q>That our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs brought to the Tryal of Juſtice, is Unrighteouſneſs. and that <hi>(ſays he)</hi> which ſhine in the Opinion of the Worker, is loathſome in the Sight of the Judge.</q> And ſhould we not obey diligently and worſhip reverently that <hi>All-Sufficient</hi>
               <pb n="233" facs="unknown:005500_0236_103965D8B2A09240"/>
God, who will be to us an exceeding great Reward <hi>Gen.</hi> xv. 1. and eſpecially Let us be entreated to walk with God, or before him, as our Text directs; to which we ſhould be mov'd by conſidering, 1ſt. The <hi>Dignity</hi> of this Practice, what can be more Honourable than to be the Friend of the King of Kings, and daily to converſe with him. If the Face of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſo ſhin'd with Beauty and Majeſty after he had been ſome Time on the Mount with God, that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> could not behold him, how much more the Soul that walks continually with God? 2dly. As this is the moſt Honourable, ſo it is the moſt Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Way of Walking: Hereby the Soul is ſatisfied with a ſuitable and All-ſufficient Good, and pleaſed with the noble proſpect of enduring felicity! Here the Good is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable to the Nature of the Soul, and equal to its vaſt Deſires and moſt diſtant Hopes! 3dly. This is the moſt <hi>profitable Way</hi> of <hi>Walking,</hi> for hereby an eaſy acceſs is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd to the King's Ear, which is the moſt important Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, for ſurely he will not deny his Friends requeſts! 4thly. This is likewiſe the moſt <hi>ſafe Way.</hi> For he <hi>that dwells in the Secret of the moſt High, ſhall abide under the Shaddow of the Almighty!</hi> From God, who is the beſt of Friends, we may expect not only Pity and Help in Adverſity, but a ſure Defence! For as he is <hi>Love</hi> itſelf, ſo his All-ſufficiency has all Creatures at it's Beck and Controle. And 5thly. It is a <hi>plain Way,</hi> Iſa. xxxv. 8. <hi>And an high Way ſhall be there,—it ſhall be call'd the Way of Holineſs, the unclean ſhall not paſs over it; but it ſhall be for thoſe, the Way faring Men, tho' Fools ſhall not err therein;</hi> but the Ways of Sin are Crooked and Intricate.</p>
            <p>Finally, dear Brethren, let us be exhorted to be ſincere in Heart, Speech and Practice, <hi>Walk before me and be thou perfect. Sincerity</hi> is the Quinteſſence the Life, the Soul of
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:005500_0237_103965D7153FD5A8"/>
all Vertue and Goodneſs! Without this neither our <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> or <hi>Services</hi> can find acceptance! From this, under God, ſprings our <hi>Peace, Joy</hi> and <hi>Security,</hi> and every other Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. Now may the All-ſufficient God enable us to walk before him, and to be Sincere, that ſo we may be approv'd of by him here, and admitted into his Kingdom hereafter, thro' the exceeding Riches of divine Grace in JESUS CHRIST our Lord, to whom with the Father and Bleſſed Spirit, be eternal Glory aſcrib'd by Men and Angels. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Amen.</hi>

            <p>WE have in theſe Words, the beginning of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s Prayer, the Occaſion of which was the Diſcoveries which <hi>Jehovah</hi> had made to him of his Purpoſe, to pull down the Nation, by putting it under the Juriſdiction of the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> King. The pious Prophet was impriſoned for declaring this Truth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the divine Direction, the City was in the mean Time beſieged by <hi>Nebucadnezar</hi>'s Army: A diſmal Cloud cover'd the whole Face of Affairs! The poor Prophet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a faithful Interceſſor for that People, was exceedingly diſtreſſed to behold the impending Stroak, the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ruin of his beloved Nation, he therefore knowing God to be infinite in Power and Mercy, takes his Flight to him in the aforeſaid gloomy and perplex'd State of Things, and puts up an interceſſory Supplication for them; which begins with a Recognition of God's infinite Power, made manifeſt in his Formation of the Heaven and Earth: Theſe vaſt Bodies being produced by a Word, and in a Moment, are inconteſtible Demonſtrations of an Almighty Cauſe or Efficient. God himſelf us'd this Inſtance, <hi>Chap.</hi> xxvii. 5.
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:005500_0239_103965D37B8628C0"/>
to confirm his Peoples Faith in his Ability, to do what he pleaſed. It is probable that the Prophet makes Mention of God's Omnipotence in the Inſtances before related, and farther expounds upon it by ſaying, <hi>That nothing was too hard for him,</hi> (in the beginning of his Prayer) with a Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Deſign, 1ſt. To affect his own Heart with an awful Senſe of the divine Majeſty. And 2dly. To ſupport his Faith in expecting the Mercies he prayed for. And 3dly. As an Argument to excite, as it were, Omnipotence to exert it ſelf in the Deliverance of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from the threatn'd De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. <hi>God is a preſent Help in Trouble,</hi> yea and a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful one, nothing is two hard for him, that does not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſome Weakneſs or Contradiction. It is therefore our wiſeſt Courſe, in Imitation of the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, to make ſpeedy and affectionate Supplication to him in all diſtreſſing Imergents, either reſpecting our ſelves or the Church of God! The Particle <hi>Ah!</hi> in the beginning of our Text, denotes the Depth and Vehemence of the Prophets mournful Paſſion! And indeed our very Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els ſhould bleed for poor <hi>Zions</hi> Tragedies, and our Lips move in the Prophets Strains; for <hi>Jeruſalems ſake I will not hold my Peace, and for</hi> Zion's <hi>ſake I will not be Silent, until the Righteouſneſs thereof go forth as Brightneſs, and the Salvation thereof as a Lamp that burneth.</hi> But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn: The Text I have read, conſidered abſtractly, preſents to our Meditations the <hi>Power</hi> of God. in diſcourſing upon which I ſhall conſider its <hi>Nature, Kinds, Properties</hi> and <hi>Effects,</hi> and then apply it. And</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. God's Power may be thus deſcrib'd, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That it is his eſſential Property whereby he can do all Things.</q> Thus excellent Mr. Vincent explains it. Or in other Words thus, <hi>That it is that divine Vertue, whereby Jehovah does what he Wills, and has ability to do what he Wills not.</hi> And hence
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:005500_0240_103965D1AB31F008"/>
it appears, that the Power of God is twofold, <hi>viz. Abſolute and Ordinate.</hi> The <hi>abſolute Power</hi> of God, is that whereby he can do all Things that are poſſible, even ſuch Things as never came to paſs, of this mention is made, Matt. iii. 9. <hi>God is able of theſe Stones to raiſe up Children unto</hi> Abram: This, according to our Conception, preceeds the Will of God, and coinceeds with the All-ſufficiency of his Eſſence. Epheſ. iii. 20. Rom. xi. 23. <hi>And they alſo if they bide not ſtill in unbelief, ſhall be graffed in, for God is able to graff them in again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly. The <hi>ordinate Power of God,</hi> is that whereby <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah</hi> effects what he Pleaſes; and therefore follows his Will, Pſa. cxxxv. 6. <hi>Whatſoever the Lord pleaſed that did he in Heaven and Earth, in the Seas and all deep Places.</hi> God's <hi>ordinate Power</hi> relates to his Efficiency, or to the Effects which he has, does or ſhall produce. It is not realy different from the former, but the former conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd as limitted by the divine Decree, which certainly fixes the <hi>Boundaries</hi> between what is meerly <hi>poſſible,</hi> and what is <hi>Future.</hi> Hence it is ſaid that our Lord could not do many Miracles, in his native Country, becauſe of their Unbelief, and that the Almighty could not deſtroy <hi>Sodom</hi> till <hi>Lot</hi> was out of it. The Power of God was bounded or limitted by his Purpoſe, which he could not counteract. Neither is it any Imperfection in the Almighty, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not contradict his own Nature; but on the Contrary, it is the higheſt Perfection!</p>
            <p>Nor are we to ſuppoſe, that Power belongs to God as diſtinguiſhed from Act; for then he would be at one Time idle, and at another employ'd in Labour, and ſo ſuffer a Change. No! the Almighty is a moſt pure Act. The aforeſaid Diſtinction is only aſcrib'd to God on the Account of Creatures, becauſe they undergo an Operation of God in
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:005500_0241_103965D028A1D718"/>
Time, which before they did not undergo, <hi>e. g.</hi> when Men are warm'd by the Sun now, who were before cold, the Change is not in the Sun, but in them.</p>
            <p>It ſhould likewiſe be conſidered, that the aforeſaid Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of God's Power into <hi>abſolute</hi> and <hi>ordinate,</hi> is only in reſpect of our Conception; for in God himſelf it is moſt Simple, and therefore but one, becauſe it is his Eſſence.</p>
            <p>But I proceed to conſider the <hi>Properties of God's Power,</hi> which was the third general Head. And</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. The Power of God is <hi>Infinite,</hi> and that in three reſpects, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Agent, Objects, Effects.</hi> The <hi>Agent God</hi> is <hi>Infinite</hi> in his Being, and with this his Power co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inceeds, or is the ſame. The <hi>Objects</hi> are likewiſe <hi>innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> which can be produc'd by him, and therefore Infinite, in ſome Senſe. And as <hi>Wendeline</hi> well obſerves, <q>God never produces an Effect ſo Excellent, but he can produce a more Excellent.</q> The ſacred Scriptures confirm the Infinity of God's Power, various Ways, 1ſt. <hi>Symbolically</hi> and <hi>Figuratively,</hi> when it aſcribes to him a <hi>ſtrong Hand, a ſtretched out Arm,</hi> 1 Chro. xxix. 12. <hi>In thine Hand is Power and Might.</hi> Our Text aſcribes to God, a ſtretched out Arm, and intimates, <hi>that thereby the Heaven and Earth were made.</hi> 2dly. <hi>Negatively,</hi> when it denies any Thing to be Difficult to him. Gen. xviii. 14. <hi>Is any Thing too hard for the Lord. At the Time appointed will I return unto thee, according to the Time of Life, and</hi> Sarah <hi>ſhall have a Son.</hi> Agreeable hereto are the Words of our Text, <hi>and there is Nothing too hard for thee.</hi> 3dly. <hi>Effectively,</hi> when it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the greateſt Effects to God's Power, ſuch as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of the Heavens and Earth, as the Text we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering doth, <hi>Ah Lord God! behold thou haſt made the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and the Earth by thy great Power!</hi> And likewiſe when
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:005500_0242_103965CEA5F1AF20"/>
it witneſſes that God can do all Things. Luk. xviii. 27. <hi>And he ſaid the Things that are impoſſible with Men, are poſſible with God.</hi> 4thly. <hi>Affirmatively,</hi> when it aſcribes great Power to him, as in the Words of our Text, and expreſly calls him the <hi>Almighty. (Rev.</hi> i. 8.) It is obſerv'd by ſome, that God's Almightineſs, or infinite Power, is aſſerted no leſs than Seventy Times in Scripture. Yea, no leſs than Thirty one Times in one Book, viz. <hi>Job.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And does not Reaſon likewiſe eſtabliſh the ſame Truth? For ſeeing Power is a Perfection, how can it be deny'd to him who is infinitely Perfect. And foraſmuch as Creatures derive all the Power they poſſeſs from God, as the firſt Cauſe, then ſurely he himſelf muſt poſſeſs eminently and infinitely what he communicates to others! Neither was there any before him, to limit this, or any other of his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, and therefore it is Infinite. If God were not Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in Power, his Determinations would be precarious and trifling, like thoſe of his Creatures: And his Promiſes and Threatnings in rewarding or puniſhing, would neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our Truſt or Fear: For then he could not ſay as he does, Iſa. xlvi. 11. <hi>I have ſpoken it, I will alſo bring it to paſs, I have purpoſed it, I will alſo do it.</hi> And</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. The Power of God is <hi>independant,</hi> he can Work by Means, without Means, and contrary to Means. 1 Sam. xiv. 6. <hi>There is no reſtraint to the Lord, to Work by many or by few.</hi> Dan. iv. 34, 35. <hi>And all the Inhabitants of the Earth are reputed as nothing, and he doth according to his Will in the Armies of Heaven and among the Inhabitants of the Earth, and none can ſtay his Hand, or ſay unto him, what doſt thou?</hi> 
               <q>The Pleaſure of God, (as Mr. <hi>Flavel</hi> obſerves) is the only Rule according to which divine Power exerts itſelf in the World.</q>
            </p>

               <pb n="240" facs="unknown:005500_0243_103965CCC9B371B8"/>But the Power of God is 3dly, <hi>Unparallel'd:</hi> Jehovah not only equals, but infinitely exceeds all created Beings in Strengh, Job xl. 9. <hi>Haſt thou an Arm like God, or canſt thou Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with a Voice like him.</hi> Men are wont to ſhew their Strength by their Arms; and hence Arms are metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally aſcribed to God. And even thoſe Things that are weak in us, when aſcrib'd to him exceed the combin'd Force of the whole Creation. How weak is one of our Fingers, yet God is ſaid <hi>by his Finger to caſt out Devils!</hi> Luk. xi. 20. Yea by his Finger, <hi>to make the Heavens.</hi> Our Words, our Breath, our Frowns, are trifling! But by a Word God made a World! Pſal. xxxiii. 9. <hi>He ſpake and it was done, he commanded and it ſtood faſt! The Almighty ſmites the Earth with the Rod of his Mouth, and with the Breath of his Lips he ſlays the Wicked, and they periſh at the Rebuke of his Countenance.</hi> Pſal. lxxx. 16. So that, as the Apoſtle obſerves, <hi>the Weakneſs of God is ſtronger than Man.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor</hi> i.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly The Power of God is <hi>irreſiſtible</hi> and <hi>ſupream,</hi> the whole Poſſe of Men and Angels, were there Millions more than there be, if their Strength was united cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand Omnipotence! <hi>Job</hi> xxiii. 13. <hi>But he is in one Mind and who can turn him, and what his Soul deſireth even that he doeth.</hi> The Almighty challenges the whole Creation to obſtruct his Providence, or defeat his Councils! <hi>Iſa.</hi> xliii. 13. <hi>I will work and who ſhall let it. Iſa.</hi> xiv. 27. <hi>For the Lord of Hoſts hath purpoſed, and who ſhall diſanul it, and his Hand is ſtretched out, and who ſhall turn it back?</hi> All Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Power is deriv'd from the Power of God, and is therefore dependant on it, and limitted by it. It was God that gave <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> that proud and potent Prince his Kingdom and his Power (<hi>Dan.</hi> ii. 37.) It is the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God that reſtrains the Wrath of Men and Rage

The Angels whether Good or Bad, are powerful Beings, and hence call'd <hi>Principalities</hi> and <hi>Powers;</hi> one of them is able to vanquiſh all the Strength of Fleſh and Blood; yet are they ſubject to the Controle of Omnipotence. And</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. The Power of God is <hi>incomprehenſible,</hi> it not only exceeds human Power, and human Probability, but ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes the Words and Thoughts of Men. The Power of God reaches the very Heart, which he turns as Streams in the South to anſwer his own eternal Purpoſes, i. e. ſuddenly. The Lord <hi>ſtills the Noiſe of the Sea, the Noiſe of the Waves, and theri Tumult of the People</hi> Pſ. lxv. 7. How ſoon did Jehovah turn the Heart of Angry <hi>Eſau,</hi> into kind Reſpect? When all human Help fails, and there is none ſhut up or left, then does the Lord exert his Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence, <hi>In the Mount of the Lord it ſhall be ſeen! Gen.</hi> xxii. 14. <hi>i. e.</hi> In extreme Diſtreſs when all human Probability of Relief expires, then the Power of God appears! And who is able to paint in human Language, the Infiniteneſs of the Strength of God, or form Ideas in his Mind equal to it; not one? (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> iii. 20.) God is able to do exceeding abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly above what we are able to ask or think. The fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Flight of our moſt exalted Thought falls infinitely ſhort of the vaſt extent of the divine Power. Hence is that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Paſſage in <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s Propheſy (lv. 8, 9.) <hi>As far as the Heavens are above the Earth, ſo are my Thoughts above your Thoughts, and my Ways higher than your Ways.</hi> The
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:005500_0245_103965C989FE74D8"/>
Lord often exceeds his Creatures Hopes, both in Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals and Spirituals. <hi>I had not Thought to ſee thy Face</hi> ſaid <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> to <hi>Joſeph, and lo God hath ſhew'd me thy Seed.</hi> Gen. xlviii. 11. The Debtor only deſir'd Patience, and the Creditor forgave the Debt. (<hi>Mat.</hi> xviii. 26, 27.) The Prodigal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd but the State of a Servant, but lo he is treated as a Son, with the greateſt Reſpect! His ungrateful Carriage is not ſo much as once mentioned, the fatted Calf is kill'd for his Entertainment, his Ears are delighted with muſical Sympho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, while Shoes are brought for his Feet, a Ring for his Finger, and the beſt Robe for his Back. But</p>
            <p n="6">6thly. The Power of God, is a <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>rightful Power. Power</hi> and <hi>Right</hi> in Creatures, are often ſeparated, they do that which they have no Right or Authority to do; but in God they are one and the ſame, what he can do, he has a Right to do, and what he has a Right to do, he can do. This Right is founded upon the Tranſcendant Eminence, and infinitely ſuperior excellency of his Godhead; as well as upon his creating, preſerving, providing and Redeeming Goodneſs. On theſe Accounts he hath a right to Rule over the Work of his Hands according to his ſovereign Pleaſure; and to diſpenſe his Gifts upon whom, when, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> what manner he pleaſes: For he is our Potter, and we but Clay in his Hands, which he may make to Honour or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, as ſeems good in his Eyes. And</p>
            <p n="7">7thly. The Power of God is <hi>Eternal, Rom.</hi> i. 20. <hi>For the inviſible Things of him, from the Creation of the World are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the Things that are made, even his eternal Power and Godhead.</hi> Albeit God from Eternity, did not produce Effects without himſelf, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs he poſſeſs'd Power from Eternity, by which, when he pleaſed he created the World; and by this he could have created the World from Eternity, if the World could

have exiſted from Eternity! And as God's Power was from Eternity, ſo it will continue to it. Hence it is ſaid <hi>Iſa.</hi> xl. 28. <hi>That the Creator of the Ends of the Earth fainteth not, neither is weary, and that his Arm is not ſhortned.</hi> Iſa. lix. 1. This the Church uſes as an Argument, in petitioning for Deliverance. <hi>Iſ.</hi> li. 9, 10. <hi>Awake, awake, put on Strength O Arm of the Lord, awake as in the Antient Days, in the Generations of old, art thou not he that cut</hi> Rahab <hi>in Pieces, and wounded the Dragon?</hi> But I haſten to the</p>
            <p n="4">4th General Head, which was to diſcourſe upon the <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects</hi> of divine Power. And 1ſt. The Power of God is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous in the <hi>Creation</hi> of <hi>the World,</hi> what Almightineſs was neceſſary to produce the vaſt Expanſe over our Head<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, and this Maſſy ponderous and prodigious Globe we tread upon, and that by a Word and in a Moment, out of no pre-exiſting Matter? And afterwards out of the rude and indigeſted Chaos, to form the various Ranks of Beings, which both the Heavens and Earth contain, and to Beautify them with ſuch Endowments as proclaim their Creators Glory! The very nobleſt Creature within the wide compaſs of the Univerſe, cannot produce the ſmalleſt Particle, of Matter out of Nothing; much leſs endow the various Species of Being, with thoſe Capacities in which they excel each other; No! To the Production of theſe Things, infinite Strength muſt concur. Thus the Things that are made are a plain and ſenſible Demonſtration of the eternal Power, and Godhead of their Former.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. The Almightineſs of God is no leſs viſible in the <hi>Works of Providence,</hi> viz. in ſupporting the ſtately Fabrick of the Univerſe, and in directing all the Beings it contains, in their various Motions, ſo as to anſwer his own eternal Purpoſes. Many ſurprizing and improbable Events and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions are brought to paſs, which nothing but divine
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:005500_0247_103965C66F0F16B0"/>
Power could Effect. By the Courſe of Providence we often ſee that Scripture verify'd, <hi>that the Battle is not to the Strong nor the Race to the Swift.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Almighty Power of God is <hi>marvelouſly apparent</hi> in the <hi>Preſervation</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> who comparatively are ſmall in Number, and for the moſt Part weak, in reſpect of Power and Policy, amidſt numerous, politick, potent and malicious Oppoſers: And that for ſo long a Tract of Time, againſt all the malignant Efforts of Hell and Earth! How does the Glory of divine Power appear in preſerving a few Sheep, amidſt vaſt herds of cruel Wolves, in preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the burning Buſh from being conſumed with the devouring Flames, with which it is encompaſs'd. And</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. The infinite <hi>Power</hi> of God is likewiſe <hi>diſcover'd</hi> in <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>divine Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. The exceeding Greatneſs of God's Power and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty working of it muſt be exerted to <hi>form Faith</hi> in any Heart, (Epheſ. i. 19.) Nothing but Almighty Strength can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the ſtrong Man arm'd, and pluck Sinners out of his Snare. And</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. The ſame Power is neceſſary to <hi>preſerve Grace,</hi> after it is <hi>form'd,</hi> from Being quite deſtroy'd by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied Aſſaults of Enemies, both inward and outward. Hence God's People are ſaid <hi>to be preſerv'd by the Power of God, thro' Faith unto Salvation,</hi> 1 Pet. i. 5.

            </p>
            <p>The Almighty Power of God was made manifeſt, and his Arm reveal'd, in the early Propagation of the Goſpel, thro' a great Part of the World, and that in a little Time, by il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate Men! That a Syſtem of Doctrines, contrary to Men's corrupt Inclinations, and not recommended by the Arts of

Perſuaſion, or Inflence of civil Power, or any View of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or Advantage in this World, ſhould be cordially em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd by Multitudes in the politeſt Nations, and adher'd to, in defiance of all Kinds of Ignominy and Suffering even to Death, cannot be reaſonably accounted for, otherwiſe than by aſcribing it to <hi>Almighty Power!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither does it in the leaſt derogate from the Greateneſs of God's Power, that he cannot do ſuch Things as are imperfect and contradictory. Here obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. God cannot Lye or Sin in any reſpect, (<hi>Heb.</hi> vi. 18.) or change his Mind; theſe Things are not the Object of Power, but the Effects of Weakneſs; and therefore it's God's Glory to be incapable of them! Nor 2dly. Can the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty do thoſe Things that imply a Contradiction, or are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible in the Nature of Things. God cannot make a Contradiction true, for this would overthrow the very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Things, and ſo deſtroy his own Wiſdom therein Aparent! He cannot make a Creature equal to himſelf, for then it would not be a Creature: God indeed can do what is impoſſible <hi>to Nature.</hi> i. e. he can exceed its ſtated Bounds and Limits, as appears by the miraculous Works he has wrought: But he cannot do <hi>what is impoſſible in Nature.</hi> Now that is <hi>impoſſible in Nature</hi> which involves a Contradiction, either on the Part of God, when the Work implies an Imperfection, in a moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Worker, or on the Part of Things, when they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw themſelves. Now both this Kind of Contradiction is impoſſible to God, becauſe it would infer that God ſhould deny himſelf (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 13) or that he ſhould ſay, that he is not God. A Contradiction ſeeing it cannot be, a Being cannot be a Work of Power, or the Object of Power. But I proceed to the Improvement of this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. And</p>

This <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> the <hi>Temanite,</hi> expreſſes in beautiful Language, <hi>Job.</hi> xv. 25, 26. <hi>For he ſtretcheth out his Hand againſt God, and ſtrengthneth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt the Almighty.

Who when he touches the Mountains they Smoke, yea the Hills tremble at his Preſence! At his Reproof the Pillars of Heaven ſhake, the Perpetual Hills do bow, and the everlaſting Mountains are ſcattered! Who is able to Screne your guilty Souls from the wrathful Strokes of the Arm of Omnipotence? Truly in vain is Salvation hoped for from the Hills, and from the multitude of Mountains. God <hi>is Wiſe in Heart, and Mighty in Strength: Who has hardened himſelf againſt him, and hath proſpered?

            <p>How will ye be able to bear the Weight of <hi>Jehovah</hi>'s angry Arm, the Reach of which ye cannot avoid. Is it not a fearful Thing to fall into the Hand of the living God? Can thine Heart Endure, or thy Hands be Strong in the Day that God deals with you? Surely he will magnify his Power in your Deſtruction, Rom. ix. 22. <hi>What if God, willing to ſhew his Wrath, and to make his Power known, endur'd with much Long-ſuffering, the Veſſels of Wrath fitted to Deſtruction?

            <p n="2">2dly. The Power of God ſpeaks <hi>Comfort</hi> to all penitent Believers in all their Troubles, of whatſoever Nature they be. Are you encompaſs'd with many Enemies and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, well God's Power is your Sanctuary, which is able to Protect you againſt the moſt formidable Foes, <hi>if God is for you, who ſhall be againſt you? The Name of the Lord is a ſtrong Tower, the Righteous run to it, and are ſafe!</hi> What tho' your Enemies be many and Mighty, one God is an overmatch for them all, Men and Devils can go no farther then the Length of their Chain: They can have no Power againſt us, except it be given them from above, as our Lord obſerved to proud <hi>Pilate,</hi> when he boaſted that he had Power to crucify or releaſe him, (<hi>John</hi> xix. 10.) The Power of God can ſoon put a Hook in their Jaws, and lead them by a Way they came not. When our Heart and our Strength fails, God is the Strength of our Heart and our Portion forever. How reviving is that Word of God by the Prophet, Iſa. xli. 10. <hi>Fear thou not for I am with thee, be not diſmay'd for I am thy God; I will ſtrengthen thee, yea I will help thee, yea I will uphold thee, by the right Hand of my Righteouſneſs.</hi> Tho' we be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced exceeding Low and have none on Earth to help us, God alone can deliver us, Iſa. lix. 16. <hi>He wondered that there was no Interceſſor, therefore his Hand brought Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto him, and his Righteouſneſs ſuſtained him.

               <hi>MOSES</hi> is enjoyned by <hi>Jehovah</hi> in the firſt Verſe of this Chapter, and alſo in that out of which our Text is taken, to deliver the ſummary of divine Laws to all the Congregation of the Children of <hi>Iſrael. Moſes</hi> muſt make known God's Statutes, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim them thro' the Camp, that ſo every one might hear and know his Duty, in order to practice the ſame. And hence we may learn, that the Devotion which ſprings from Ignorance, that that Religion which commends it, cannot be of God; becauſe it is directly contrary to the Method which God has taken with his reaſonable Creatures, reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the Affairs of Religion, in all the Ages of the Church, both under the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and Goſpel Diſpenſations! Now the Words of our Text contain two Things obſervable, <hi>viz.</hi> A <hi>Command,</hi> and a <hi>Reaſon enforcing</hi> it. And</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. There is a <hi>Command, ye ſhall be Holy,</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>The Word</hi> Holy, ſays Pool in his Synopſis upon the Place, and other learned Men, <hi>properly ſignifies to ſeparate,</hi> i. e. <hi>from a Common to a Religious Uſe</hi>
               </q> And hence the Temple and Tabernacle and many Things in both, were call'd <hi>Holy:</hi>
               <pb n="252" facs="unknown:005500_0255_103965B8DD0ED7C0"/>
And likewiſe the whole People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and many other Things, which it is needleſs to mention: The Word here ſignifies, <q>not only a Sepation from all the Defilements before mentioned;</q> as Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> obſerves, both in his <hi>Synopſis,</hi> and <hi>Annotations;</hi> but alſo an inward Averſion to all I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>urity and Sin, together with a habitual Devoted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to all moral Purity. <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s being diſtinguiſhed from all other People, by peculiar Laws, was to teach them the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of a real Separation from the World and the Fleſh, and of an entire Devotedneſs to God; and this is likewiſe the Law of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> i. 15.16. <hi>But as he who hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led you is Holy, ſo be ye Holy in all manner of Converſation; becauſe it is written, be ye Holy, for I am Holy.</hi> We are the Followers of the Holy JESUS, and therefore muſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Capacity, be conſecrated to God's Honour, and conform'd to his Nature and Will, <hi>ye ſhall be Holy;</hi> the Words are not a Propheſy or Promiſe, but a Precept, importing as much as this, <hi>be ye Holy.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> i. 15. Or <hi>ye muſt be Holy.</hi> It is as if God had ſaid, ye muſt take Care and Pains, to have the Habits or Principles of Holineſs, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in your Hearts, and to exerciſe and expreſs the ſame, in all your Speech and Practice! But</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. We have the <hi>Reaſon enforcing</hi> this Command, and that is twofold, viz. The Nature of God and his Relation to them, <hi>for I the Lord your God am Holy.</hi> And 1ſt. God in his Nature is Holy, yea Holineſs itſelf, the Fountain, Idea, and Patern of all Holineſs. (<hi>Iſa.</hi> lxiii. 15. <hi>Ezek.</hi> xx. 12.) It is therefore every Way reaſonable, that we ſhould ſeek Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of him, and conform ourſelves to his Example, ſeeing it is in itſelf Reaſonable and Noble, and without it we can have no Complacence in him here, or Enjoyment of him hereafter.

            <p>The Subject that offers it ſelf to our preſent Meditations, from the Text, which I have been labouring to explain, is that <hi>venerable Attribute</hi> of the <hi>divine Nature,</hi> viz. <hi>Holineſs:</hi> This is very frequently aſcribed to God in the ſacred Scriptures, thus he is call'd <hi>the Holy one,</hi> Iſa. xl. 25.

He is call'd <hi>thrice Holy,</hi> Iſa. vi. 3.—<hi>Rev.</hi> iv. 8. Or the Character of <hi>Holineſs</hi> is three Times repeated. Holineſs is aſcrib'd to all the Perſons of the Trinity, the Father is call'd <hi>the Holy one of Iſrael:</hi> The Son is call'd <hi>the moſt Holy,</hi>

            <p n="2">2dly. Without <hi>Holineſs</hi> he could not carry himſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently, or as it is fit and proper to himſelf; and ſo by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, he could not behave himſelf ſuitable to his Creatures, not govern them Holily and Well.

            <p n="3">3dly. Without <hi>Holineſs</hi> he could not be perfect in any Attribute: For as Mr. <hi>Scudder</hi> obſerves, <q>Holineſs is the Beauty of all God<hi>'s</hi> Attributes, without which his Wiſdom would be Sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And laſtly proceed to ſome practical Uſes.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Then ſeeing the Holineſs of God, as it is in him, is ſo Sublime and Tranſcendent, that it is inacceſſible to our weak and finite Minds; it will be neceſſary, firſt to behold it in its Emblem, or Effects, and from that to proceed to the producing Cauſe, or Prototype. Now the Image or Effect of the Holineſs of God, is that Holineſs, which Jehovah is pleas'd to form in intelligent Beings or Creatures. Holineſs therefore in its general Nature, may be thus deſcrib'd, <hi>viz. That it is the moral Goodneſs of a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Being.</hi> To underſtand which, let it be obſerv'd, that <hi>Goodneſs</hi> is <hi>two-fold, viz. Phyſical</hi> and <hi>Moral, Phyſical Goodneſs</hi> is likewiſe two-fold, <hi>viz.</hi> either of <hi>Being</hi> or <hi>Uſe;</hi> a Thing may be call'd Good <hi>phyſically</hi> or <hi>naturally</hi> either when its being is deſireable, or when it ſerves to anſwer the End deſign'd for it. In both theſe Reſects, all the ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimate and irrational Parts of the Creation are call'd Good by God himſelf, the beſt Judge of Things. <hi>Gen.</hi> i. ult. <hi>And God ſaw every Thing that he had made and behold it was very Good!</hi> But <hi>moral Goodneſs,</hi> is that which is adorn'd, with ſuch Manners, as become a God! and this is peculiar to reaſonable Creatures. Now the Holineſs of Creatures is
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:005500_0258_103965B35E7568B8"/>
three-fold, <hi>viz. Relative, Fedral,</hi> and <hi>Real,</hi> 1ſt. <hi>Relative,</hi> is that whereby Times and Places, and other Things are call'd holy, becauſe they relate to a Holy God, and are appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated by him, being ſeparated from a Common, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to a Religious Uſe by his Authority, which they have a Tendency to promote. In this Senſe the Sabbath, the Temple, and many Things in it, were call'd Holy. 2dly <hi>Federal Holineſs,</hi> is that whereby Perſons are ſeparated from the World, to be God's peculiar People, in order to the Study of Holineſs, when they profeſs this, and by their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion are in the Judgment of a reaſonable Charity, look'd upon as Saints or Holy Perſons. <hi>Deut.</hi> vii. 6. <hi>For thou art a Holy People unto the Lord thy God, the Lord thy God hath choſen thee to be a ſpecial People unto himſelf, above all People that are on the Face of the Earth.</hi> Num. xv. 40. <hi>That ye may remember, and do all my Commandments and be Holy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your God.</hi> In this reſpect the Whole Nation of Iſrael, were of old Holy to God (<hi>Ex.</hi> xix. 6.) They are therefore call'd <hi>a Holy Nation.</hi> (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> ii. 9. <hi>Num.</hi> xvi. 3.) And Scores of Times the whole Nation of Iſrael are call'd <hi>God's People</hi> in Scripture. <hi>Ex.</hi> iii. 10. <hi>That thou mayſt bring forth my People the Children of Iſrael out of</hi> Egypt. In this Reſpect the Children of believing Parents are Holy. (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vii. 14.) But 3dly. <hi>Real Holineſs,</hi> conſiſts in the Exerciſe and Growth of good Habits or pious Diſpoſitions infus'd, and is therefore twofold, <hi>viz. Habitual</hi> and <hi>actual. Habitual,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the inward <hi>Purity</hi> of the Will and Affections, whereby we are inclin'd to live to God; or it conſiſts, in the Infuſion of a Conſtellation, or Train of Graces, into the Soul, which turns its inward and general Bent into a ſpiritual and Heavenly Channel! By this the Soul of Man, is in ſome Sort conform'd to the Nature of God; <hi>Actual</hi> Holineſs conſiſts in the Exerciſe of the aforeſaid divine Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits,
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:005500_0259_103965B1A269A1A0"/>
eſpecially in our Speech and Practice, whereby, thro' God's gracious Concurrence, they are increas'd. Hereby the Life is conform'd to God's Will and Law: From what has been obſerv'd, it appears, therefore that Holineſs contains the four following Ingredients, or Particulars. <hi>viz.</hi> 1ſt. A <hi>Separation</hi> from a <hi>common</hi> or <hi>profane Uſe,</hi> in which Senſe, <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle, is ſaid to be <hi>ſeparated to the Goſpel of God.</hi> Rom. i. 1. And the Lord JESUS as Mediator, is ſaid <hi>to be ſanctified. John</hi> x. 36. And 2dly. A <hi>Dedication</hi> to a <hi>divine</hi> or <hi>religious Uſe,</hi> whereby we deliberately, unreſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly, and reſolutely <hi>devote</hi> ourſelves and our all to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Glory and Service. (<hi>Rom.</hi> xii. 1. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> viii. 5.) Firſt they gave their own ſelves to the Lord.—And 3dly. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a <hi>Repreſentation,</hi> of the <hi>Divine Holineſs,</hi> the <hi>Heart</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling the <hi>Purity</hi> of the divine <hi>Nature,</hi> and the <hi>Life</hi> the <hi>Purity</hi> of the <hi>Divine Law.</hi> And 4thly. Holineſs includes a <hi>Deteſtation</hi> of, and <hi>Flight</hi> from all <hi>Impurity. Pſ.</hi> xcvii. 10. <hi>Ye that love the Lord hate Evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the aforeſaid Image, or <hi>Emblem</hi> of Holineſs in Creatures, we may gather this Deſcription, of the Holineſs of God! <hi>viz.</hi> That it is his <hi>Moral Excellency,</hi> whereby <hi>he is ſeparated from every thing common or prophane, hereby he is inclind to ſeek himſelf, and his Glory above all. (Pro.</hi> xvi. 4. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> i. 11.) <hi>and is conform'd exactly to that Holineſs which is expreſs'd in the Moral Law in his Thoughts, Words and Deeds.</hi> And hence he often in his Word invites Men to an Imitation of his Holineſs. (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> i. 15, 16.) As God's <hi>Power</hi> is <hi>oppos'd</hi> to all <hi>natural</hi> Weakneſs, and his <hi>Wiſdom to Folly,</hi> ſo <hi>his Holineſs is oppos'd to all moral Blemiſhes,</hi> or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, which we call Sin. <hi>Hab.</hi> i. 13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Holineſs</hi> is a <hi>Diſpoſition,</hi> to ſeek the moſt excellent End, in the higheſt Degree, and to refer all to it. The beſt Good, certainly deſerves to be the laſt End! Now Jehovah
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:005500_0260_103965B0056C9878"/>
being himſelf, the beſt Good, infinitely ſuperior in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, to all Creatures, he muſt therefore conſequently be his own laſt End! Hence is that of the Prophet. <hi>Iſa.</hi> xlii. 8. <hi>I am the Lord, that is my Name, and my Glory will I not give to another, nor my Praiſe to Graven Images.</hi> And it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears farther to be reaſonable, that God ſhould ſeek himſelf as his own laſt End, becauſe he is Self-exiſtent, &amp; from no other! This <hi>Devotedneſs</hi> therefore of the Almighty to ſeek his own <hi>Glory, as his chief End,</hi> appears to be a very conſiderable <hi>Branch</hi> of the Holineſs of God. But for Creatures, who are but an inferior Good, and borrow their Beings from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother to make themſelves, or any thing that concerns them as ſuch, their laſt End, is a great Inſtance of Impiety: The very nature of Sin ſeems to conſiſt in this, <hi>viz.</hi> A <hi>Deviation</hi> or wandering in our <hi>Views, Deſigns</hi> or <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> from God's Glory, to ſome other End, <hi>as Chief</hi> and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream. Seeing that all Things are from God, as a creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or producing Cauſe, and thro' him alſo as a ſupporting Cauſe, therefore all ought to be directed to him, as a final Cauſe. (<hi>Rom.</hi> xi. 36.) The Holineſs of God ſeems to be the Harmony of his Attributes, as they are oppos'd to Sin! and therefore it's call'd the <hi>Beauty</hi> of the Lord! <hi>Pſ.</hi> xxvii. 4. <hi>One Thing have I deſir'd of the Lord, that will I ſeek after, that I may dwell in the Houſe of the Lord, to behold the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Lord.</hi>—Holineſs ſeems to put a Luſtre upon the other Perfections of the divine Nature, without which, they would be inglorious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe impure!</p>
            <p>Now the Holineſs of God, is either <hi>eſſential</hi> or <hi>declarative.</hi> The <hi>eſſential Holineſs of God</hi> is <hi>nothing elſe but the tranſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant and incomprehenſible Eminence of the divine Nature or Being, or his Purity and Glory.</hi> And hence he is ſaid <hi>to be glorious in Holineſs. (Ex.</hi> xv. 11.) The <hi>declarative Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God</hi> conſiſts in the <hi>Diſplays</hi> of the <hi>Former</hi> in God's
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:005500_0261_103965AE628C15F0"/>
               <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Works,</hi> they are diſtinguiſh'd only in our manner of Conception, and not in God. And thus I am led to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe upon the</p>
            <p n="2">2d. Propos'd, which was to ſhew the <hi>Properties of God's Holineſs.</hi> Now the eſſential Holineſs of God, has the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Properties, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. It is <hi>original Holineſs,</hi> it is the Source of all thoſe Stremes of Holineſs which appear in Creatures: It is the Subſtance and Prototype, their's but the Shadow and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py borrow'd from it! <hi>Jehovah</hi> has receiv'd it from none, but created Beings derive all theirs from this, Rom. xi. 35 —<hi>Who hath firſt given to him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly. It is <hi>ſimple Holineſs,</hi> i. e. It is the very Being of God, and not any Thing added to it: Hence God is ſaid to <hi>ſwear by his Holineſs,</hi> Pſal. lxxxix 35. Whereas Holineſs in Creatures is not their Nature, or Being, but ſome Diſpoſition or Quality added to it, and therefore ſeparable from it; and hence they are only call'd Holy, but not Holineſs: This laſt Term ſpeaks an Abſtract, ſimple and uncompounded Being! And</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. It is <hi>eternal Holineſs,</hi> and this it muſt needs be, ſeeing it is the ſame with his Eſſence; which has been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prov'd to be eternal, in a proceeding Sermon. As it is impoſſible in the Nature of Things, that ever God ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be, ſo it is equally impoſſible that ever he ſhould be without Holineſs, which is his Beauty and Glory, for then he would be no God; but a Being of a contrary Character. Now as the Holineſs of God had no Beginning, ſo by Conſequence it can have no End! Whereas on the Contrary the Beings of all Creatures, beginning with Time, or commencing in it, are Temporary; and their Holineſs, which could not exiſt before their Beings, muſt be of the like Kind: As it had a Beginning ſo it may have an End.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="259" facs="unknown:005500_0262_103965ACE0871E30"/>4thly. <hi>Immutable Holineſs:</hi> It is liable to no Change or Alteration, for the Reaſon aforeſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe it is him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: And hence it is ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> xv. 4. That <hi>God only is Holy, i. e.</hi> He is holy ſo as none elſe beſides him is; the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Excellencies of Creatures are liable to manifold Change, yea they may be entirely Loſt; witneſs the Apoſtacy of the Angels, and the fatal Fall of our firſt Parents. Hereby the Crown has fallen from our Heads, and we have come Short of the Glory of God!</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. <hi>Tranſcendent Holineſs, above all Degrees:</hi> It being abſolutely Perfect, can receive <hi>no increaſe:</hi> The Holineſs of all created Beings amaſſed together, would be but as a Drop compar'd with the Infinite Ocean of Purity in God: But the <hi>Holineſs</hi> of <hi>all Creatures</hi> is certainly <hi>Gradual</hi> on Earth, and poſſibly ſo in Heaven; for if the Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels increaſe in Knowledge, why may they not in Love, and other good Diſpoſitions! Hence God is ſaid to Charge his Angels with Folly, and that the Heavens are not clean in his Sight; by which, (by a Metonimy,) we may underſtand the Inhabitants of Heaven, whoſe <hi>Holineſs</hi> when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd with God, may be call'd <hi>Impurity!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6thly, It is <hi>Infinite Holineſs,</hi> it is without all Bounds, and is therefore term'd <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> it ſelf. (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> i. 5. and iv. 8.)</p>
            <p>Whereas the Angels, who ſeem to be the Pureſt of creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Spirits, vail their Faces in the immediate Preſence of God, as being aſham'd of their comparative Deformity; while they behold that radiant Beauty and burniſh'd Glory which appears with ſurprizing Blaze and venerable Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty in the <hi>Holineſs</hi> of God!

            <p n="2">2dly.

               </gap>im is juſt, that that which is the Firſt and Beſt in every Kind, is the Rule and Meaſure of the Reſt! <hi>(Primum et Optimum in unoquoque genere, eſt regula, &amp; menſura ceterorum.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3dly. <hi>Univerſal:</hi> As God's <hi>Holineſs</hi> is <hi>diffus'd</hi> thro' all <hi>his Attributes within himſelf,</hi> ſo it appears in his <hi>Word,</hi> and all his <hi>Works without,</hi> and that free from the leaſt Intermiſſion or Variation; the Truth of which will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear under the next general Head of Diſcourſe, <hi>viz.</hi> The</p>
            <p n="3">3d. <hi>Propos'd,</hi> which was to repreſent the <hi>Manifeſtations</hi> or Diſcoveries of <hi>God's Holineſs:</hi> And here we may juſtly obſerve, with the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> in General, That <hi>God is Holy in all his Works, (Pſal.</hi> cxlv. 17.) But it is peculiarly Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in thoſe following, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. In his <hi>eternal Decrees</hi> reſpecting his People: God has therein from everlaſting, purpos'd and ſecured upon a ſtrong and impregnable Foundation, the <hi>Holineſs</hi> of the Elect, and hence it is ſaid, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> i. 4. That <hi>he hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen us in him, before the Foundation of the World, that we ſhould be</hi> Holy <hi>and without Blame before him!</hi> 2 Theſ. ii. 13, <hi>Becauſe God hath, from the beginning, choſen you to Salvation, thro' Sanctification of the Spirit!</hi> And</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. The <hi>Holineſs of God, appears</hi> in the <hi>Creation of Man,</hi> in making him after his own Image in <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> (Epheſ. iv. 25.) Tho' Man has ſince found out many Inventions to his Shame and Loſs; yet, as <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerves, <hi>he was made at firſt upright!</hi> A perfect and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:005500_0264_103965A93986AB58"/>
Rectitude crown'd the human Nature in its primitive State, together with a freedom of Will and Power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere therein! God's Fore-knowledge and Purpoſe did not bereave Man of his Liberty of acting, or lay him under a natural Neceſſity of ſinning; for if ſo, then God would be the Author of Sin; which is blaſphemous to Imagine! And was it not the Deſign of God in making the irrational and inanimate Parts of the Creation, that thereby intelligent Beings might be excited to admire and adore the Perfections of their Former, and conform to him?</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. The <hi>Holineſs</hi> of <hi>God appears</hi> in <hi>his Works</hi> of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> eſpecially in his preſcribing to intelligent Creatures a Law to direct them in his Service, and in enforceing that Law by proper Sanctions of the moſt <hi>deſirable Rewards</hi> and <hi>formidable Puniſhments!</hi> Hereby repreſenting before them the unſpeakable Advantages of his ſincere Service, as well as on the Contrary, the dreadful Conſequences of a Neglect thereof! And has not Almighty God by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, in ſome ſignal Inſtances, manifeſted his holy Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure againſt Sin, by executing upon Tranſgreſſors, the Threatnings annex'd to the Violation of his Law? As the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> obſerves, Pſal. ix. 16. <hi>The Lord is known by the Judgments which he executeth: The Wicked is ſnared in the Work of his own Hands!</hi> It is true, Judgment is not always ſpeedily executed, and therefore the Hearts of the Sons of Men are fully ſet in them to do Evil! And the Reaſon is, becauſe the preſent State of Things, is a Time of Probation, and not of Recompence; which ſhews the Neceſſity of a future Judgment, when a righteous God ſhall render Vengeance and Recompence! However both Scripture and Hiſtory inform us, of ſome dreadful Diſplays of divine Severity, againſt obſtinate Tranſgreſſors, that the
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:005500_0265_103965A79C7AC198"/>
World may know there is a God who deteſts their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties! And</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. Has not the <hi>Holineſs of God had a moſt ſurprizing Diſplay</hi> in <hi>the Work of Redemption?</hi> Rather then Sin ſhould paſs unpuniſh'd, did not the Almighty Father puniſh it in his own Son? His only begotten and eternally beloved Son! Did not his Sword awake againſt the Man that was his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion? The darling of his Soul! And did he not afflict him with all the Waves of his intollerable Vengeance, which was due for the Sins of the elect World? Our deareſt Lord trod the Wine Preſs of his Fathers Wrath alone!— The Chaſtiſement of our Peace was laid upon him, that thro' his Stripes we might be healed. Our Redeemer under the Agonies of Deſertion for our Sins, referrs to the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God therein made manifeſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> xxii. 3. <hi>But thou art Holy O thou that Inhabiteſt the Praiſes</hi> of Iſrael! And</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. God's <hi>Holineſs appears</hi> in his <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>divine Grace,</hi> whereby he prepares his People here, for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of Himſelf hereafter. Hence effectual Calling, is term'd <hi>a Holy Calling.</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> i. 9. And we are ſaid to be called, <hi>not unto Uncleaneſs, but unto Holineſs.</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> iv. 7. And what is Regeneration, and Sanctification, but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of the Image of God's Holineſs in Man? And what is Glorification,? Does it not in a degree conſiſt in the perfecting of the aforeſaid Image in the Redeem'd? Then that which is in part ſhall be done away, <hi>Then ſhall our Lord preſent to himſelf, a Church holy and glorious, without Spot and Blemiſh.</hi> Eph. v. 27. Again</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. <hi>God diſcovers</hi> his <hi>Holineſs</hi> in his <hi>Word,</hi> every Page of which proclaims his Purity, and hence it is call'd <hi>Holy;</hi> by his Truth contain'd therein, <hi>we are ſanctified or made Holy. (John</hi> xvii. 17.) <hi>The Words of the Lord are pure Words, as Silver tried in a Furnace of Earth, purified ſeven Times.
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:005500_0266_103965A5F9CCFF40"/>
Pſ.</hi> xii. 6. <hi>The Law of God is holy, and the Commandment juſt and Good.</hi> Rom. vii. 12. And no Wonder, for it is the Image of the divine Purity, a Tranſcript of the divine Nature, as far as it is imitable; hence it is likned to a Glaſs. <hi>Jam.</hi> i. In this we behold God and ourſelves, <hi>For by the Law is the Knowledge of Sin.</hi> The Law of God, ſays the <hi>Pſalmiſt, is perfect, converting the Soul.</hi> Pſ. xix. 7. The <hi>Goſpel</hi> is <hi>Holy,</hi> and hence it is call'd, a <hi>holy Covenant. (Luke</hi> i. 72.) The great Deſign of it, is to promote Holineſs, by laying Men under more endearing and ingenuous Engagements there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. And</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. God does not only <hi>diſcover his Holineſs</hi> in his <hi>Works and Word;</hi> but alſo in his <hi>Worſhip;</hi> hence the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of <hi>Worſhip, viz.</hi> The Sacraments are call'd <hi>Holy,</hi> becauſe they tend to promote Holineſs, and likewiſe <hi>the Time and Place of Worſhip,</hi> are call'd <hi>Holy.</hi> God is ſaid <hi>to hallow the Sabbath (Ex.</hi> xx. 11.) The Temple of old was call'd Holy, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs is ſaid <hi>to become God's Houſe forever. (Pſ.</hi> xciii. v.) On this Account it is ſaid to be the Place, where God's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour dwells. (<hi>Pſ.</hi> xxvi. 8.) The Miniſters, and Attendants of Worſhip, are call'd <hi>Holy. Aaron</hi> was to wear on the Front of his Mitre, a Plate of Gold, with this Motto en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven on it, <hi>viz. Holineſs to the Lord.</hi> Ex. xxviii. 36. The <hi>Angels,</hi> thoſe Attendants of Worſhip, are call'd <hi>holy. Luke</hi> ix. 26. And is not Holineſs the great Deſign, and Tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Religious Worſhip? And Hence is that Word of God to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Ex.</hi> x. 3. <hi>I will be ſanctified in them, that come nigh me.</hi> But it is Time to proceed to ſome practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Uſes. And</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. If God be Holy, as has been prov'd, then we may hence learn, that he cannot be the Author of Sin, which is ſo contrary to his Nature, or of any Doctrines that tend to promote it. Now the following Doctrines of the <hi>Papiſts,
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:005500_0267_103965A41F91F090"/>
Antinomians,</hi> and <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> are of this Sort, and therefore ſhould be rejected with Abhorrence, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. The Doctrine of Indulgencies, or Pardons for Sin. This was oppos'd by <hi>Swinglius</hi> in <hi>Helvetia,</hi> and by <hi>Luther</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> in the Year 1516. and being defended by Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> became the Occaſion of the Reformation.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. The Popiſh Diſtinction of Sins into Venial and Mortal. The Former they ſay do not deſerve eternal Puniſhment, contrary to Scripture, (<hi>Rom.</hi> vi. 23.)</p>
            <p>To thoſe I might add their gainful Doctrine of Purgatory. And likewiſe their holding with the Phariſees of old, that the Law reſpects only outward Acts: Whereas the inward Principle from which thoſe flow, is more corrupt than any Act that proceeds from it. As the aforeſaid Doctrines are moſt abſurd in themſelves: For how can it be ſuppos'd with any Appearance of Reaſon, that any can forgive Sins, but that God againſt whom they are committed? I ſay as they are abſurd in themſelves, ſo they have a manifeſt Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to promote impiety, and therefore are not of God.</p>
            <p>To the Former Catalogue, may be added ſome <hi>Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Doctrines, which are not leſs unreaſonable and perilous, <hi>viz.</hi> Juſtification from Eternity, or from the Time of Chriſt's Death. That the Law is no Rule of Life to Believers; that there is no need of Repentance under the Goſpel; that Faith conſiſts in ſuch an Aſſurance, as is ſucceeded by no Doubts; That there is no preparative (of order) that goes before Faith. Thoſe Doctrines open a Door to all Impiety. They directly tend to make Chriſt a Miniſter of Sin, and his Goſpel an Inſtrument of Iniquity; and therefore cannot be from God. It is an Inſtance of the vileſt Ingratitude, to draw from the Doctrine of free Forgiveneſs, an Argument againſt Repentance!</p>
            <p>And indeed the <hi>Arminian</hi> Doctrine of Univerſal Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:005500_0268_103965A29B4F5D10"/>
has an awful Tendency to make Men ſecure in Sin. Of the like Nature is the Doctrine of all <hi>Enthuſiaſts,</hi> in oppoſing the ſtated Performance of Religious Duty. This, whatever falſe Guiſes is put upon it, tends to wear off the Senſe of God and divine Things, and to prepare Men for Deluſions in Principle and Iniquity in Practice. And</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. From what has been ſaid, in the Explicatory Part of this Diſcourſe, we ſhould be induc'd to examine ourſelves, in order to know whether we be truly Holy or not? Which we may know by an impartial comparing of ourſelves, with what has been already deliver'd on this Subject, to which I ſhall add the following <hi>Characters</hi> of true Holineſs, which duly conſider'd may aſſiſt the Examination of ourſelves. And</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. <hi>True Holineſs</hi> is <hi>Sincere,</hi> it Eyes God more than Man, and aims at his Glory above all, in the general Courſe of Action. And herein it is like the Holineſs of God himſelf, inaſmuch as it aims at the ſame End with him. (<hi>Mat.</hi> vi. 1, —6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> x. 31.)</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. It is <hi>internal chiefly,</hi> as it begins in the Mind and Heart, ſo it takes more Care of that, than the Outſide. (<hi>Pſ.</hi> li. 6.) directly contrary to this were the Phariſees of old in their Practice. (<hi>Mat.</hi> xxiii. 23.)</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. It is <hi>Evangelical,</hi> proceeding chiefly from that Faith in CHRIST, which is of the Operation of God, and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by Love. As God's People receive Strength from CHRIST to perform Acts of Holineſs, by a believing De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on him, ſo they are conſtrained or influenced by Love to him, to labour to be Holy. And their Attainments and Labours in Religion, are attended with a humble Senſe of their own Imperfection. <hi>Not as tho' I had already at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd,</hi> ſaid holy <hi>Paul, or were already perfect, but I preſs forward.</hi> And</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="266" facs="unknown:005500_0269_103965A0CAE66F90"/>4th. True Holineſs is <hi>Univerſal,</hi> and that both in regard of the <hi>Subject</hi> in which it is <hi>plac'd,</hi> and the <hi>Object</hi> about which it is <hi>exercis'd.</hi> The whole Soul in all its Powers is in ſome Meaſure renew'd, the <hi>Mind</hi> is <hi>enlightned, the Will bow'd, the Affections in their general Bent,</hi> and in the <hi>higheſt degree are turn'd towards God.</hi> And both Soul and Body ſeparated from the habitually governing Love of the World, and willingly devoted to God, together with all we poſſeſs, not reſerving to ourſelves any Thing with <hi>Ananias,</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phira,</hi> and the young Phariſee. (<hi>Rom.</hi> xii. 12. 1 <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſ.</hi> v. 23.) Some derive the Word <hi>Holy (hagios)</hi> from a Letter and a Word which ſignify to be void of Earth. Now as the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> is univerſally alter'd, in reſpect of the whole Number of its Parts, ſo is the <hi>Object univerſal alſo.</hi> True Holineſs includes in it, an Averſion not only to this or that impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with the Phariſees, but to all with every Appearance thereof. (<hi>Tit.</hi> xi. 12. <hi>Jud.</hi> 23.) And likewiſe an <hi>Inclination to,</hi> and <hi>endeavour after every good Work. Job.</hi> xiii. 18.</p>
            <p n="5">5thly <hi>True Holineſs</hi> is <hi>continual,</hi> it endures to the End, ſuch as have it, aim at, and labour for Growth in Goodneſs, and when they find not ſatisfactory Signs thereof, are griev'd!</p>
            <p>Now all ſuch <hi>who</hi> upon Examination find in themſelves, the preceeding Characters of Holineſs, may take Comfort to their Souls, whatever Circumſtances of Diſcouragement they may be in, from within or from without. And that for the following Reaſons. 1ſt. Becauſe it is not the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but Truth of Grace that evidences our Sanctification. 2dly. Becauſe our imperfect Holineſs, is accepted thro' Chriſt, in whom we are compleat. <hi>He is made of God to us Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification and Redemption.</hi> 3dly. He that has begun a good Work in us, has promiſed to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it on, <hi>to the Day of the Lord JESUS.</hi> God is Holy and
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:005500_0270_1039659F082845A8"/>
the Fountain of all Holineſs. God has promis'd to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the <hi>Stony Heart, and give us a Heart of Fleſh, to give us a new Heart and a new Spirit, and that he will cauſe us to walk in his Statutes. Ezek.</hi> xxxvi. 25, 27. 4thly. What tho' we at Times are afflicted with our Corruptions, it is no more than the Saints of God have been before us! <hi>Woe is me, ſaith</hi> Iſaiah, <hi>for I am a Man of polluted Lips. Iſa.</hi> vi. 5. Yea this is the Language of the Church. <hi>Iſ.</hi> lxiv. 6. <hi>But we are all as an unclean Thing and all our Righteouſneſſes, are as filthy Rags, and we all do fade as a Leaf, and our Iniquities, like the Wind have taken us away.</hi> The Pſalmiſt complains of the ſame Diſeaſe, and yet Hopes. <hi>Pſ.</hi> lxv. 3. <hi>Iniquities prevail againſt me, as for our Tranſgreſſions, thou ſhalt purge them away.</hi> And thus did the Apoſtle <hi>Paul. Rom.</hi> vii. 24. <hi>Who ſhall deliver me from this Body of Sin and Death? But God will blot out our Iniquities, as a thick Cloud, and will remember our Sins no more, Iſ.</hi> xl. 22. <hi>CHRIST hath given himſelf for his Church, that he might ſanctify it, by the waſhing of Water thro' the Word. Eph.</hi> v. 25, 26. And let us comfort ourſelves with this, in all our Troubles, that he who now ſanctify's us, will by and by glorify us, (<hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 30.)</p>
            <p>But on the contrary all ſuch as want the aforeſaid Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, are in a doleful Caſe! In the Gall of Bitterneſs and Bond of Iniquity. Such, ſo continuing, can have no Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with a Holy God here, nor enjoy him hereafter. (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> i. 6.—<hi>Heb.</hi> xi. 14.) And eſpecially how diſmal is the Caſe, how impious the Courſe, of thoſe who murmur at ſtrictneſs in Religion, and deride Holineſs. What do theſe in Effect, but riſe up in Arms againſt God himſelf, while they practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally deny his Holineſs. The Language of their Practice is, that they would cauſe <hi>the Holy One of Iſrael</hi> to ceaſe from among them. They would, if they could, deſtroy the divine Being; but by their impotent Malice, they will but
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:005500_0271_1039659D840D75D8"/>
ſecure and heighten their own Ruin. But I proceed to a Uſe of Exhortation. From the Conſideration of Gods Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, we ſhould be exhorted, 1ſt. To <hi>glorify God</hi> on the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this divine Attribute after the Example of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Angels. <hi>Iſa.</hi> vi. 3.—2dly. Let us ſeek the <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Sanctification</hi> from God, in the earneſt Uſe of all appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Means, paticularly by Meditation on its Excellency, and Neceſſity, by Prayer, reading and hearing the Word of God, and converſing with pious People. And 3dly. Let us <hi>exerciſe</hi> thoſe <hi>Principles,</hi> in all Holineſs of Converſation. Now we ſhould be excited to Holineſs, by the following Motives. 1ſt. God is Holy, yea Holineſs itſelf, and Wills our Sanctification. 2dly. Holineſs is his principal and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Perfection, and therefore by the Study of Holineſs we reſemble God in his chief Excellency. 3dly. He who is Holy, is the Lord, or Jehovah, and ſo able to compenſate the Labours we uſe to be like him. 4thly. He is our God, and ſo has given himſelf to us, and we ourſelves to him in Covenant, and therefore we are bound to be Holy, both by Gratitude for his undeſerved Love, &amp; by our own Promiſe. 5thly. Holineſs is exceeding excellent, it exalts and eno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles our reaſonable Nature, by conforming it to the Divine. 6thly. It is as neceſſary as excellent, in a twofold reſpect <hi>viz.</hi> Both of <hi>Command,</hi> and <hi>Mean.</hi> As God enjoyns it by his ſovereign Authority ſo it appears to be of abſolute Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, from the very Nature of Things. For without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to God, we can have no complacence in him, and ſo no Communion with him, either in this or a future World. And without Communion with God, there can be no Enjoyment of God. See <hi>Heb.</hi> xii. 14. 7thly. It is <hi>pleaſant. Solomon</hi> juſtly obſerv'd, <hi>That Wiſdoms Ways are Ways of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs, and all her Paths Peace.</hi> Hereby Fellowſhip with God is attain'd, which is the moſt ſweet Entertainment;
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:005500_0272_1039659BDDF94F30"/>
and our Hope of Glory confirm'd, which is the moſt ſupporting Proſpect. 8thly. <hi>Profitable. (Jer.</hi> ii. 31) <hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſerving God there is great Reward.</hi> Farther what is the great Deſign of our eternal Election, next to the Glory of God, but that we ſhould be Holy. <hi>Eph.</hi> i. And is not this the Scope of our Saviours Death, and of the Office of the Holy Spirit? Did not our Lord die <hi>to purchaſe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a peculiar People zealous of good Works?</hi> And to what Purpoſe, is our <hi>effectual Calling,</hi> but that we <hi>ſhould be holy in all manner of Converſation?</hi> As a holy Converſation is pleaſing to God, (<hi>Prov.</hi> xi. 20.) ſo it hath a noble Tendency, to promote his Kingdom among Men: Whereas the contrary diſhonours God's Name, grieves the Hearts of the Godly, and hardens the Hearts of the Wicked. Is not the Deſign of all the Parts of God's Word, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ther Doctrinal, Hiſtorical, Precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, Promiſory, Minatory, as well of the various Diſpenſations of Providence we meet with, to promote Holineſs? And are not all theſe loſt to us, if this be not obtain'd, Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Comforts are loſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yea and the Ordinances, are alſo loſt to us. Our Profeſſion and Prayers, yea and the Eyes of God, Men and Angels that are upon us, oblige us to be Holy. In this Way we may expect that God will be our Sun and Shield, and will give us Grace and Glory. <hi>Amen.</hi>

He ſummones the Attention of the inanimate Creation partly to reprove the Stupidity of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bear Witneſs to the Truth of what he was about to deliver to them in the following Song, either for their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction or Warning, as well as to witneſs to the Juſtice and Equity of the divine Proceedings againſt that unhappy Nation! <hi>Give Ear O Heavens and I will ſpeak, and hear O Earth the Words of my Mouth!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the 2d Verſe the devout Penman of this Song, wiſhes that the Inſtructions contain'd in it, may be refreſhing to and effectual upon his beloved Nation, as the Rain and Dew upon the Earth, <hi>my Doctrine ſhall drop as the Rain, my Speech ſhall diſtil as the Dew.</hi>—Theſe Words may be conſidered as a Prayer of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as if he had ſaid, <hi>O! That it might do ſo;</hi> thus Biſhop <hi>Patrick</hi> underſtands the Words. In the next Verſe he ſignifies his Intention to make known the Glory of God, and therefore excites them to <hi>aſcribe Greatneſs to him;</hi> which Intention he performs in the Words
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:005500_0274_103965983A965A20"/>
of our Text, wherein we have a Repreſentation of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Glory and Greatneſs apparent in the Perfection of his Works, and equity of his Government, in a Variety of Particulars, <hi>viz.</hi> 1ſt. He is call'd a <hi>Rock,</hi> to ſignify the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> of his <hi>Nature,</hi> the <hi>Firmneſs</hi> of his <hi>Councils,</hi> the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability</hi> of his <hi>Promiſes,</hi> and <hi>Almightineſs</hi> of his <hi>Power!</hi> In all which Reſpects he is a ſecure Shelter and unſhaken Foundation for our Reſort and Confidence.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. His <hi>Work is Perfect,</hi> 
               <q>His Work of Creation was ſo, all that he made in its original Conſtitution was very Good; his Works of Redemption and Providence ſhall be be ſo when the Myſtery of God is finiſhed.</q> 
               <q>God's Works are true, and cannot be blam'd, <hi>ſaith</hi> Ainſworth <hi>upon the Place,</hi> God never recalls his Councils, but perfects them. God's Work is call'd <hi>Perfect,</hi> becauſe he has fulfill'd what he promis'd to the Fathers.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3dly. <hi>All his Ways are Judgment, i. e.</hi> ſayeth Henery, <q>the Ends of his Ways are all Righteous, and he is Wiſe in the Choice of the Means in order to thoſe Ends,</q> By <hi>God's Ways,</hi> we are to underſtand all Gods Providential Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations towards intelligent Creatures, and by <hi>Judgment, Prudence,</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> (Hoſ. xiv. 9.)</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. <hi>He is a God of Truth,</hi> i. e. as Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> obſerves in his <hi>Synopſis,</hi> 
               <q>Faithful in his Promiſes; whoſe Word we may depend upon, for he cannot Lie.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5thly. <hi>Without Iniquity,</hi> he is perfectly Free from all moral Blemiſh and Defect. <q>He deceives none that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fides in him, and wrongs none that apply for Juſtice, and is hard upon none that caſt themſelves upon his Mercy.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6thly. <hi>Juſt and Right is he:</hi> God is Holy and Equal in his Diſtributions; as he is juſt in himſelf, ſo he is juſt in all his Dealings with Mankind, none can with Reaſon accuſe him of Inſincerity, Unrighteouſneſs, or Levity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="272" facs="unknown:005500_0275_1039659699E3F9B8"/>Now that <hi>Attribute</hi> or <hi>Perfection</hi> of God which is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally repreſented in our Text, by a beautiful variety of Expreſſions, is his <hi>Juſtice;</hi> this therefore is the Subject of our preſent Meditations. That God is <hi>juſt,</hi> the Scripture proves many Ways, particularly 1ſt. <hi>Metaphorically</hi> and <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratively,</hi> when he is therein call'd a <hi>conſuming, Fire, an angry Lyon, a Man of War. (Deut.</hi> iv. 24. <hi>Iſa.</hi> xxxviii. 13.)</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. <hi>Affectively,</hi> by attributing to him <hi>Zeal, Anger, Jealouſy, Fury. (Num.</hi> xi. 10. <hi>Exo.</hi> xx. 5. xxxii. 10.) The aforeſaid Affections ſuppoſe <hi>Juſtice</hi> in Creatures, and tho' they be Paſſions in them, they are in God but an Act of <hi>immutable Juſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3dly. <hi>Effectively,</hi> by ſhewing that he renders to every one according to his Works. (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xxvi. 23.)</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. <hi>Negatively,</hi> by removing from him all Injuſtice, and Iniquity, all reſpect of Perſons; and in a Word all the Cauſes and Effects of <hi>Injuſtice. (Job.</hi> viii. 3.) Doth God pervert <hi>Judgment,</hi> or doth the Almighty pervert <hi>Juſtice? (Dan.</hi> ix. 14. <hi>Rom.</hi> iii. 4.).</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. <hi>Poſſitively,</hi> by affirming and extolling his <hi>Juſtice</hi> by calling him a <hi>Revenger, Holy, Right. (Jer,</hi> xii. 1.) <hi>Pſ.</hi> xi. 7. <hi>For the Righteous Lord loveth Righteouſneſs, his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance doth behold the Upright.</hi> To theſe we may add the Words of our Text, then which nothing can be more Full and Expreſs, <hi>He is a Rock, his Work is Perfect, for all his Ways are Judgment: A God of Truth, and without Iniquity, Juſt and Right is he:</hi> And alſo that of the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt,</hi> Pſal. cxix. 137. <hi>Righteous art thou O Lord, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right are thy Judgments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And does not Reaſon comfirm the ſame Truth? For 1ſt. If God be not Juſt, whence is there any <hi>Juſtice?</hi> Either there would be no <hi>Juſtice</hi> at all, or if there was
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:005500_0276_103965948B6D9538"/>
any it would not proceed from God! Or if it did, it muſt proceed from one who had none; each of which Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars is abſurd. Beſides</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. Inaſmuch as the Lord is Governor of the whole Univerſe, he would degenerate into a Tyrant, if he was not Juſt. And</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. Seeing <hi>Jehovah</hi> is judge of all the Earth, how could he judge a right without being juſt himſelf? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it be otherwiſe but that God ſhould be juſt, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he is abſolutely Perfect: All confeſs Juſtice to be an Excellency, involving no imperfection in it, and therefore it cannot be wanting to that Being, who is abſolutely and infinitely Perfect!</p>
            <p>In diſcourſing upon this divine <hi>Attribute</hi> of God's <hi>Juſtice,</hi> I purpoſe to conſider its <hi>Nature, Kinds, Properties, Diſplays,</hi> and in the 5th Place to Anſwer ſome <hi>Objections,</hi> and then proceed to the Improvement. And</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. <hi>Juſtice</hi> in its general Nature may be ſaid <hi>to be an Agreement with Right and Rule:</hi> It is oppos'd to Crooked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Obliquity, by which any Thing declines from its proper Rule. Crookedneſs in Morals is the ſame with Sin; which the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> calls a <hi>Tranſgreſſion of the Law.</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> iii. 4. Or as the original Word, <hi>Anomia,</hi> may be rendered a Being without the Law, or a wandering from the Law. <hi>Juſtice</hi> does therefore coincide with Rectitude or Uprightneſs, <hi>Ecle.</hi> vii. 29. <hi>Lo this only I have found that God hath made Man Upright:</hi>—So that Juſtice includes two Things in it eſpecially, <hi>viz. Right,</hi> and an <hi>Agreement with that Right,</hi> 1ſt. I ſay it includes <hi>Right</hi> or that which belongs to every one, Luk. xx. 25. <hi>Render therefore unto</hi> Caeſar <hi>the Things that are</hi> Caeſar<hi>'s, and unto God the Things that are God</hi>'s. Rom. i. 32. <hi>Knowing the Judgment of God that they that do ſuch Things are worthy of Death.</hi>—It
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:005500_0277_10396592EA1DD470"/>
is from this <hi>Right</hi> that the very Name of <hi>Juſtice</hi> is deriv'd. And</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. It includes an <hi>Agreement with this Right;</hi> and in this the Form of <hi>Juſtice</hi> conſiſts: And the Contrary to this <hi>viz.</hi> A Diſagreement from Right, conſtitutes the Form of Injuſtice. From this general Deſcription it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that Juſtice admits of no Degrees, for a Thing either agrees with the Rule of Right or not; if the Former, it is Juſt, if the Latter, it is Unjuſt.</p>
            <p>Undoubtedly the <hi>Juſtice of God,</hi> as well as of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures conſiſts in an Agreement with Right, but with this difference, that the Creatures have their Rule of Right preſcrib'd by another; whereas the divine Nature is a Rule of Right to the Almighty. But let me paſs to the</p>
            <p n="2">2d. Propos'd, which was to ſpeak of the <hi>Kinds of Juſtice:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here it may be obſerv'd that Juſtice may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered under a threefold View, <hi>viz.</hi> As relating to God's <hi>Will, Word,</hi> and <hi>Deeds.</hi> And 1ſt. <hi>Juſtice,</hi> as it relates to the <hi>Will</hi> of God, is thus deſcrib'd by <hi>Wendeline, viz.</hi> 
               <q>That it is that whereby God is juſt in himſelf and without himſelf gives to every one their own by a conſtant Will.</q> 
               <q>Juſtice in Man, <hi>ſayeth Mr.</hi> Leigh, is a ſettled Will, to do Right in every Thing to every Perſon.</q> Thus God hath a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled Will to do Right, ſhall not the Judge of all the Earth do Right? This conſtant Will of God, to render to every one his own, Coincides with the divine Eſſence, and may be call'd his <hi>eſſential Juſtice,</hi> and is no other but the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Rectitude of his Nature. And that <hi>Juſtice of God,</hi> which reſpects his <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Deeds,</hi> may be call'd his <hi>declarative</hi> or <hi>relative Juſtice;</hi> becauſe it is a Manifeſtation of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and reſpects the Tranſactions of God with Creatures.</p>
            <p>But 2dly. The <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God, as it relates to his <hi>Words,</hi> is call'd, <hi>Truth, Faithfulneſs</hi> and <hi>Conſtancy;</hi> becauſe it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:005500_0278_10396591643184A8"/>
with the Rectitude of his Nature to ſpeak ſo and no otherwiſe. Faithfulneſs may be well call'd <hi>Juſtice;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a doing Juſtice to his Word.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. The <hi>Juſtice of God,</hi> as it reſpects his <hi>Deeds,</hi> is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, <hi>viz.</hi> Of <hi>Dominion</hi> and <hi>Juriſdiction.</hi> And 1ſt. God's <hi>Juſtice</hi> of <hi>Dominion,</hi> or, as ſome Divines term it, <hi>his diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Juſtice,</hi> is that whereby <hi>Jehovah,</hi> as the ſole Monarch and ſupream Lord of all, diſpoſes and governs every Thing in a juſt Order; and in Particular he diſpoſes his own Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, according to the Rule of Equity, requiring and prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting nothing but what is fit for intelligent Creatures, in right Reaſon to do and forbear. In a Word this Juſtice of Dominion conſiſts in governing reaſonable Creatures, agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the original Rectitude of their Natures.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. God's <hi>Juſtice</hi> of <hi>Juriſdiction,</hi> conſiſts in preſcribing to reaſonable Creatures their proper due, and in governing them accordingly: And this the Almighty doth by three Things, 1ſt. By preſcribing <hi>Laws,</hi> which are Rules tending to direct Mankind in their Duty to God and Man, agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his own Sanctity, attended with Rewards and Puniſhments. Jam. iv. 12. <hi>There is one Law-giver who is able to ſave and to deſtroy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly. By eſtabliſhing his Laws by proper <hi>Sanctions</hi> of Rewards and Puniſhments promis'd and threatn'd. (<hi>Deut.</hi> xxx. 15.) Now the Sanction conſiſts in Promiſes and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings. And</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. By <hi>fulfilling the Sanction,</hi> and that both as to the Reward and Puniſhment, the former is call'd <hi>Remunerative,</hi> and the latter <hi>Vindictive.</hi> And 1ſt. <q>The <hi>Remunerative Juſtice</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> is a moſt ready Will to perform Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</q> as <hi>Wendline</hi> obſerves. When God rewards the Obedience of his Creatures with a free Reward, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from his own pure and abounding Goodneſs, not for any
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:005500_0279_1039658F8E653DE0"/>
Worth or Condignity in his Peoples Works, as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> vainly Dream; but for the Sake of his gracious Promiſe, by which he makes himſelf a Debtor to them, Rom. ii. 6.7, 8. <hi>Who will render to every Man according to his Deeds; to them who by patient Continuance in Well-doing, ſeek for Glory, and Honour and Immortality, eternal Life: But to them that are Contentious and do not obey the Truth, Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Wrath.</hi> Luke xvii. 10. <hi>When we have done all that is commanded, we muſt ſay, that we are unprofitable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, we have done that which was (but) our Duty to do.</hi> Rom. xi. 35, 36. <hi>Or who hath firſt given to him, and it ſhall be recompenſed to him again? For of him, and thro' him, and to him are all Things.</hi> Altho there be no intrinſick Worth in Man's Obedience, to merit the Glory or Reward promiſed, yet God having promiſed it to the Creature, and having a Right and Power to confer it, it is juſt and right in him to perform his own Word. And certainly he would wrong his Truth if he did not. When Happineſs in Scripture is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as a reward, it is only to encourage or excite to Obedience, by ſhewing the inſeparable Connection between Grace wrought in us, and Glory conferr'd upon us: It cannot intend any merit in our Works; for if we ourſelves be leſs then the leaſt of God's Mercies, then the beſt Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons put forth by us muſt be ſo: For as Doctor <hi>Ridgly</hi> obſerves, <q>The Action cannot have more Honour aſcrib'd to it then the Agent.</q> Being God's Creatures we have deriv'd all from him, and conſequently can offer him no more than his own. And Being corrupt Criminals, our Services are Defective, and ſo cannot merit Good at the Hand of God; nay on the Contrary, for our Tranſgreſſions we merit his Wrath. And therefore in reſpect of us, the Reward of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs is wholly Gracious; but indeed in Reſpect of Chriſt, who has fully anſwered the Demands of Law for his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:005500_0280_1039658DC3BDFE18"/>
by his Obedience and Suffering, and thereby according to the Covenant Tranſaction between his Father and him, compleatly purchas'd for them everlaſting Life, it may be call'd an <hi>Act of divine Juſtice.</hi> Hence it is ſaid Rom. ii. 26. That <hi>he might be juſt, and the juſtifier of him that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves in Jeſus.</hi> But</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, The <hi>Vindictive Juſtice of God,</hi> is the Almighty's Will, to execute the Threatnings of his Law upon Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors, by puniſhing or inflicting on them Evils of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equal to their Crimes: This is call'd <hi>Wrath, Hatred, Revenge</hi> and <hi>Judgment.</hi> It is likewiſe term'd <hi>God's viſiting Iniquity,</hi> (Jer. 5.9.) <hi>His ſetting his Face againſt a Perſon,</hi> (Lev. xvii. 10.) Its call'd <hi>the Fire of God's Jealouſie,</hi> and thoſe that are expos'd to it, are ſaid <hi>to fall into the Hands of the living God.</hi> Some Divines uſe the Terms of reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Revenging Juſtice, inſtead of Remunerative and Vindictive.</p>
            <p>But here I would have it obſerv'd, that there is a leſs proper Senſe in which the Word <hi>Puniſhment</hi> is uſed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Thus when God corrects his People with his Rod, this is often call'd <hi>Puniſhment. (Pſal.</hi> lxxxix. 30, 33). And hence they are ſaid <hi>to bear the Indignation of the Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have ſinned againſt him.</hi> Mic. vii. 9. Theſe Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions are call'd <hi>Puniſhments,</hi> becauſe occaſion'd by Sin, and afflictive to Senſe: But they are not inflicted by God as a Judge, with any Demand of Satisfaction, for that was made by CHRIST, for thoſe that believe in him; and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is contrary to the Nature of divine Juſtice, to require a double Satisfaction for the ſame Crimes! No! the Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God's People ſpring from his Fatherly Love to them, and are ſent either to prevent or correct ſinful Diſorders. By theſe the Almighty humbles his People, by ſhewing them the Deſert of their Impieties; and by theſe he brings
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:005500_0281_1039658C21227BA0"/>
them nearer to himſelf, and deadens them more to a vain World, and all it's varniſh'd but empty Entertainments! Afflictions are the Medicines which the great Phyſician Uſes to cure his People's manifold Diſorders.</p>
            <p>But that what has been ſaid, concerning the Nature of divine Juſtice, may be farther explain'd and illuſtrated, let theſe Things following be conſidered. 1ſt. That Juſtice among Men is Two-fold, <hi>viz.</hi> Either <hi>Commutative</hi> or <hi>Diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butive. Commutative,</hi> reſpects Trade and Bargains among equals, and conſiſts in obſerving the Rules of Equity and Right therein. <hi>Diſtributive,</hi> is that which is exercis'd by a Superior towards his Inferiors, and conſiſts in the Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of their Adminiſtrations to rule and law, and therefore comprizes theſe four Things in it, <hi>viz.</hi> 1ſt. A <hi>Law</hi> to which the Acts of Government ſhould be conform'd. A Law, ſays <hi>Mareſius,</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>Eſt faciendorum &amp; fugiendorum nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, ſub Ratione praemii et Paenae. i. e.</hi> It is the Rule of Things to be done and avoided, on Conſideration of a Reward or Puniſhment.</q> All Juſtice and eſpecially Diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butive, has reſpect to a Law; this is the Foundation on which it is Built, and Rule according to which it muſt be ſquar'd and accommodated.</p>
            <p>Now the Law that is the Ground and Foundation of Juſtice among Men, muſt have the following Characters, viz. 1ſt. It muſt be bottom'd upon natural Equity, upon the Nature, Relation and Reaſon of Things: Otherwiſe it will be a crooked Rule, and ſo unworthy of Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. No human Authority can alter the intrinſick Goodneſs and Badneſs of Things; and therefore bad Laws (in a moral Senſe) are but a recommending and enforcing Iniquity by human Authority. And 2dly. The <hi>Law</hi> muſt be <hi>enacted</hi> by <hi>competent Power</hi> and Authority; becauſe Legiſlation, as well as the Execution thereof, are Acts of Government,
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:005500_0282_1039658A9EC57100"/>
which thoſe that exerciſe ſhould have a Right ſo to do, either originally or by Delegation: The Contrary to which tends to open a Scene of Confuſion and Blood. And hence it is well obſerv'd by ſome, that however juſt any Act of Government be in itſelf, yet it is unjuſt for thoſe to meddle with it that have no Right thereto, <hi>e. g.</hi> For a Judge to condemn one Guilty of a Capital Crime to Death is Juſt; but for a private Perſon diveſted of Authority to do it, is Murder!</p>
            <p>And 3dly. The <hi>Law</hi> muſt be <hi>promulgated</hi> that it may be known; <hi>for where there is no Law there is no Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion,</hi> Rom. iv. 15. But the</p>
            <p n="2">2d. Particular that Civil Juſtice, or Juſtice among Men includes, is <hi>Conformity</hi> to the Law in all Adminiſtrations. When a Judge doth this, in all his Enquiries and Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations reſpecting Caſes brought before him, he does his Duty, and otherways he perverts the Ways of Judgment. It is this Kind of Juſtice among Men, that is an Emblem or Shadow of the Juſtice of God, and therefore I have ſo long diſcours'd upon it! But to ſhew the Similitude, let me add a few Words more, and enquire what is God's Declarative or Relative Juſtice, but his Conformity to the Law, he has given his Creatures in his Tranſactions with them. Here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. 1ſt. That the Law which God gave to Man to direct him in his Service is grounded on natural Equity, or the nature and reaſon of Things; which appears by the Harmony of its Precepts among themſelves, and their direct Tendency to promote the Glory of God, and make the Creature happy in his Service. The Contraries to which tend to diſhonour God, debaſe our intelligent Nature, and deſtroy our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. The moral Law is but a Tranſcript of the divine Nature as far as it is imitable. And hence is the Apoſtles juſt commendatory Encomium concerning it. <hi>Rom.</hi> vii. 12. <hi>Wherefore the Law is Holy, and the Commandment Holy; and
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:005500_0283_10396589027FD8C8"/>
juſt and Good.</hi> And 2dly. That God had Authority to enact Laws, appears evidently from his creating all. As his infinite and eternal Excellency makes him worthy of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Sovereignty and Dominion, ſo his producing all by his Almightineſs, gives him an irrefragable Right thereto. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Power is deriv'd, delegated and limitted, but his is Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal and Abſolute. And 3dly. Almighty God having a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex'd the Sanction of Rewards and Puniſhments to the Law he has given his Creatures: His Truth ſtands engag'd to execute the ſame upon ſuitable Objects; which is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe neceſſary to anſwer the Deſign of Government. This Execution therefore of the Sanction of the Law, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity thereto, in the Dealings of God with his Creatures, is his declarative Juſtice, and with this even all his Acts of Sovereignty do really harmonize; which appears by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering,</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. The Properties of divine Juſtice, which are theſe following, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Divine Juſtice is <hi>impartial, with him is no Reſpect of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> in Judgment. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 10. <hi>For we muſt all appear before the Judgment Seat of CHRIST, that every one may receive the Things done in his Body, according to that he hath done whether it be Good or Bad.</hi> Juſtice will nor ſpare for the ſake of the Multitude, Greatneſs, or Nearneſs of the Guilty. Did not <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morha</hi> periſh by Fire, &amp; was not the whole Antidiluvian World drowned with Water? And what vaſt Multitudes of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may we ſuppoſe did the aforeſaid Cities, together with <hi>Zeboim</hi> and <hi>Adma</hi> contain? And how much more the whole World before the Flood; and yet all were deſtroy'd by a ſuddain and terrible Stroak of divine Juſtice. And when the Angels, thoſe Spirits of excelling Dignity, ſinned, did not divine Juſtice caſt them into an Abyſs of Woe? And does it not ſtill confine them in Chains of Darkneſs,
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:005500_0284_1039658718BFB568"/>
to the Judgment of the great Day? When <hi>Adam</hi> our feder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Head, had tranſgreſſed the Covenant, was he not baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from that Paradiſe of Pleaſure he before poſſeſs'd, and kept out of it by a flaming Sword. Divine Juſtice ſcatters Kings as Snow in <hi>Salmon;</hi> and before its adverſe Edge their pompous Armies <hi>flee apace! (Pſ.</hi> lxviii. 12, 14.) And were not <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>David</hi> tho' ſo near and dear to God puniſhed with awful Severity? Hence is that ſolemn and Soul affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Saying of the Prophet, <hi>Amos</hi> iii. 1, 2. <hi>Hear this Word that the Lord hath ſpoken againſt you, O Children of</hi> Iſrael!— <hi>You only have I known of all the Families of the Earth, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will puniſh you, for all your Iniquities.</hi> But di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice is</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. <hi>Univerſal,</hi> ſo that not one Sin can eſcape ſevere Puniſhment, either in the Sinner or Surety. <hi>Gal.</hi> iii. 10. <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all Things, that are written in the Book of the Law to do them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3dly. Divine Juſtice is <hi>inexorable,</hi> no Importunities can alter its Courſe. When once a Sinners Seaſon of Mercy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, Jehovah refuſes to be intreated. <hi>Ezek.</hi> xiv. 18, 20. Tho' <hi>Noah, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> were in it, <hi>As I live ſaith the Lord God, they ſhall deliver neither Son or Daughter, they ſhall but deliver their own Souls by their Righteouſneſs.</hi> This is twice repeated in that Chapter to ſhew the Infallible Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, and unſpeakable Importance of the Truth delivered. The Almighty cannot be corrupted or brib'd. But that which farther confirms this awful Truth, is the</p>
            <p n="4">4th. Propos'd. <hi>viz.</hi> The Diſplays of divine Juſtice; and here to be as brief as I can, I ſhall only mention two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances thereof. The Firſt of which, was the Sufferings our LORD endur'd, when he ſtood in a Sinners Room and Place: How unſpeakable were the Tortures he endur'd in his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Body, every Part of which was put to exquiſite Pain!
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:005500_0285_1039658593557298"/>
Deep Furrows were made in his ſacred Back by cruel Scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and his beauteous Face expos'd to contemptuous Blows, yea to Shame and Spitting, by the inſulting Herd, his vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Temples were pierc'd by Thorns, his Side and Heart by a Spear, the whole Weight of his Body, hung upon a few Sinewy and ſenſible Parts in his Crucifixion, and his Name was treated with the greateſt Ignominy and Scorn. But as Mr. <hi>Flavel</hi> juſtly obſerves, <q>The Soul of our Lord's Sufferings was his Sufferings in his Soul.</q> When he who knew no Sin, was made Sin for us. His Soul was made an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for Sin, his Soul became ſorrowful even unto Death. How unconceiveable muſt be the Anguiſh, which our LORD endur'd in his Soul, when at one Inſtant of Time, that whole Weight of Diſtreſs and Pain, which was due to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice, for all the Sins of the elect World was laid upon it? And in the mean Time deſerted by the Father in reſpect of his comfortable Preſence. This preſs'd a Bloody Shower from all the Pores of our LORD'S Body in the Garden of <hi>Gethſemane.</hi> This extorted that Heart-rending Out-cry on the Croſs, <hi>Eloi, Eloi, lama Sabachthani? My God, My God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> No wonder the Earths Foundations trembled, and the Dead awoke out of their long and ſilent Slumbers, and the Sun himſelf, that glorious Orb of Light and Beauty, put on a funeral Robe of Darkneſs and Obſcurity, to teſtify their Surprize and Sorrow on ſo awful an Occaſion, and to compleat the Train of Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. But!</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. The vindictive Juſtice of God, has a dreadful Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play in the Torments of the Damned, who are puniſh'd with everlaſting Deſtruction, from the Preſence of the Lord, and from the Glory of his Power. As the Damned are depriv'd of all the Honours and Comforts of the Heavenly Paradiſe. As they are burnt in a Lake of Fire, which is kindled by the
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:005500_0286_103965840EB5D6B0"/>
Breath of God, as by a River of Brimſtone! So their into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorable Tortures by God's inflam'd Jealouſy, by their own guilty Conſciences, by wicked Men and Devils, will know no Intermiſſion and no End. The ſmoke of their Torments aſcendeth up for ever and ever. But I haſten to the</p>
            <p n="5">5th. Propos'd, which was to anſwer ſome Objections offered againſt the Juſtice of God. And</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. It is objected by the <hi>Socinians,</hi> that according to our Doctrine God, puniſh'd the Innocent in the Room of the Guilty, namely our Saviour in the Place of Sinners.</p>
            <p>Anſ. <hi>Tho' our Saviour was perſonally innocent, yet he was with his own Conſent, and by his Fathers Imputation, guilty. And hence he is ſaid</hi> to be made Sin for us, <hi>he willingly became the Sinners Surety, and ſo aſſumed their Guilt, in order to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy for it, and ſave them from Ruin, and to a willing Perſon who had a Right to diſpoſe of his own Life, eſpecially ſeeing ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aluable an End was anſwered by it, as the Salvation of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, no Injury was done, by his Father in puting him to Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly. It is Objected that God ſometimes puniſhes the Sins of the Parents in their Children. <hi>Ex.</hi> xx. 5.</p>
            <p>Anſ. <hi>God never puniſhes the Sins of the Parents in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Children. As to the Sin of</hi> Adam <hi>he being the federal Head, or covenant Repreſentative of his whole Offspring, they ſinned in him.</hi> Hoſ. vi. 7. <hi>But they like</hi> Adam <hi>(as the Words ſhould be rendred) have tranſgreſſed the Covenant.</hi> Rom. v. 12. Wherefore as by one Man Sin entred into the World, and Death by Sin, and ſo Death paſſed upon all Men, for that all have ſinned (<hi>i. e. in</hi> Adam) <hi>And as to the Sins of private Parents, they are not puniſh'd in Children, unleſs they be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe to them, or imitate them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3dly. It is objected that God is a Reſpecter of Perſons in the Affair of Predeſtination, by diſpenſing unequal Things
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:005500_0287_103965826D52A558"/>
to thoſe that were in an equal State, chooſing one, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting another, without any Reaſon but his own Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Anſ. <hi>To reſpect Perſons, is when in Matters of Judgment, equal Things according to Law and Right are due to ſeveral Perſons, and yet we diſpenſe unequal: But this is not the Caſe with the Almighty.</hi> Who hath given to him, <hi>ſayeth the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> and it ſhall be repay'd, for of him are all Things. <hi>Rom.</hi> xi. 36. <hi>As to God's Grace, he owes it to no Creature as ſuch. He is Lord of his own Treaſures, and may do with his own what he pleaſes.</hi> Rom. ix. 18, 21. <hi>And therefore ſuch as Favour the Objection, do but reply againſt God, as the Apoſtle there obſerves. Predeſtination is but an immanent Act of God, which produces nothing without himſelf, and conſequently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes neither Good nor Evil, tho' it be the Pattern according to which his Providence diſpenſes all Things in Time. But if we conſider God's Providence, which diſpenſes Salvation and Damnation, that does not confer unequal Things upon thoſe that are equal. But it confers unequal Things upon thoſe that are unequal,</hi> viz. <hi>Believers and Unbelievers. For CHRIST's Sake Salvation to the Former, and for Sins Sake, Damnation to the Latter. If a Prince of a Number of Rebels, who all according to Law deſerve Death, purpoſes and paſſes an Act of Pardon upon ſome to ſhew his Clemency, and lets the Law take place upon others to ſhew his Juſtice, where is the Wrong? And that is the Caſe, for God in his Purpoſes look'd upon Men as fallen, and meriting his Diſpleaſure, he might have left the whole Race to periſh for their Sins with the Devils, who after their Fall had never an offer of Mercy. And becauſe Jehovah has choſen ſome, when he might have condemned all,</hi> ſhall our Eye be Evil becauſe God is Good?</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. It is objected that God ſuffers the Wicked to proſper, and the Pious to be afflicted and oppreſſed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="285" facs="unknown:005500_0288_10396580EB97D210"/>Anſ. <hi>This World is a Time of Probation, and not of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence. The Scales will turn at the Concluſion of this ſhort Scene, this tranſient Drama! Beſides the Miſeries of God's People are neceſſary Phyſick to cure their Maladies, to which End</hi> they are ſanctified by the Spirit of God. <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 29. <hi>They are alſo at Times ſweeten'd with the Love of CHRIST, and ſhall ſoon expire, and then an everlaſting Sabbatiſm ſhall commence. Whereas on the contrary, the abus'd Proſperity of the Wicked, tends but to ſecure and encreaſe their Deſtruction.</hi> But it is Time to proceed to the Improvement. And</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. This Subject ſpeaks <hi>Terror,</hi> to all Ungodly and Chriſtleſs Sinners of every Kind. How deplorable is their Caſe, <hi>Who muſt drink of the Wine of the Wrath of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is pour'd out without mixture into the Cup of his Indignation?</hi> O! Let the Secure and Impenitent Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, think on the following Particulars, 1ſt. That God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Account of his Juſtice and Judgments, is call'd the <hi>Great and dreadful God,</hi> Dan. ix. 4. likewiſe <hi>mighty and terrible.</hi> Deut. vii. 22. <hi>With God,</hi> ſayeth Job, <hi>is terrible Majeſty,</hi> Job. xxxvii. 22. 2dly. That <hi>the Wages of every Sin is Death,</hi> and that you have been guilty of a prodigious Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, attended with awful Agravations: Sins againſt Light &amp; Love, againſt Law and Goſpel, Mercy, and Judgments, your Iniquities for Number rival the Stars, &amp; for Agravation are red as Crimſon. And 3dly. That the Juſtice of God will not, cannot paſs by one of them, except ye repent; but will ſurely Proportion Pains equal to all their Number and Heinouſneſs. For as has been obſerv'd, it is <hi>impartial, univerſal, inexorable.</hi> And now ſeeing every Imagination of the Thoughts of your Hearts have been ſince your Birth till now, only evil continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and all your Words and Actions evil. <hi>For a corrupt Tree cannot bring forth good Fruit, neither can he that is in the Fleſh pleaſe God.</hi> How dreadful muſt that Wrath be which is proportion'd to them all?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="286" facs="unknown:005500_0289_1039657F3123B640"/>Surely it is 1ſt. <hi>Incomprehenſible Wrath;</hi> the moſt fearful Imagination cannot fully repreſent it by its moſt gloomy I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas, Pſa. xc. 11. <hi>Who knoweth the Power of thine Anger, even according to thy Fear, ſo is thy Wrath.</hi> 2dly. It's <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable Wrath. If we take the morning Wings and flee to the utmoſt Ends of the Earth, lo there God's allſeeing Eye will diſcern us, and his righteous Arm arreſt us. If we aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſend the Top of</hi> Carmel, <hi>or deſcend into the Deeps of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean, or ſeek to conceal ourſelves with the Curtains of obſcurity, darkneſs and retirement!</hi> Even then our Perſons and Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes will be open to the all penetrating Eye of God! For the <hi>Darkneſs is as the Light to him, and the Night ſhines as the Day!</hi> Sinners ye cannot eſcape by <hi>Policy,</hi> for God is Infinite in Wiſdom; nor by <hi>Power,</hi> for he is Infinite in Strength, as <hi>Job</hi> obſerves, ix. 4. <hi>He is Wiſe in Heart and Mighty in Strength, who hath hardened himſelf againſt God and proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</hi> Nor can ye eſcape by <hi>Flight,</hi> for <hi>Jehovah</hi> is Omnipreſent. 3dly. It is <hi>eternal Wrath,</hi> (Mat. xxv. ult.) It will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue as long as God endures, never, never, never ſhall it know a Period! O this gives it a dreadful and heart rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Accent! And 4thly. It is <hi>intollerable Wrath.</hi> If the Redeemer, who was perſonally Innocent and ſupported by the Godhead, cry'd ſo dolorouſly under this Wrath: How can your Hands be ſtrong or your Hearts endure, when a Jealous God deals with you, and pours out the Vials of his unmix'd Wrath upon you, who are full of real and crimſon Guilt, and ſhall have none to ſuccour you! And do you think that that juſt God, <hi>who ſpared not his own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son,</hi> when he but ſtood in Sinners Place, but ſmote him dead by the Sword of his Juſtice, and made all the Waves of his Almighty Vengeance beat upon him, and roll over him, will ſpare you who are cover'd all over with real and Scarlet Guilt? No! Friends, <hi>be not deceived, God is not
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:005500_0290_1039657D6ADBDCE0"/>
mock'd, that which a Man ſows that ſhall he alſo reap; he that ſows to the Fleſh, ſhall of the Fleſh reap Corruption!</hi> The Intollerableneſs of the divine Wrath, Anger and Hatred, as well as its terribleneſs, is repreſented in Scripture by a variety of bold and dreadful Images of thought! I ſhall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a few of them, and in the Name of the great God, charge the ungodly to think upon them. Deut. xxxii. 22, 23. <hi>For a Fire is kindled in my Anger, and ſhall burn to the loweſt Hell, and ſhall conſume the Earth with her increaſe, and ſet on Fire the Foundations of the Mountains. I will heap Miſchiefs upon them, I will ſpend my Arrows upon them.</hi> Job. ix. 5, 6, 7. <hi>Which removeth the Mountains and they know it not, which overturneth them in his Anger. Which ſhaketh the Earth out of her Place, and the Pillars thereof Tremble. Which commandeth the Sun and it riſeth not, and ſealeth up the Stars.</hi> Pſa. xi. 6. <hi>Upon the Wicked he ſhall rain Snares, Fire and Brimſtone, and a horrible Tempeſt, this ſhall be the Portion of their Cup.</hi> Elſewhere <hi>Jehovah</hi> threatens <hi>to wound the hairy Scalp of the Wicked, and to tear them in Pieces when there ſhall be none to deliver them. That he will tear and go away</hi> (Hoſ. v. 14.) <hi>That he will be to them as a Lyon and as a Leopard, and meet them as a Bear bereav'd of her Whelps, devour them like a Lyon, and rent the Caul of their Heart, Hoſ.</hi> xiii 8. And with what Magnificence and Grandeur of Diction, does the Prophet <hi>Nahum</hi> ſpeak upon this ſolemn Subject? Nahum 1. 2,—7. <hi>God is Jealous, and the Lord Revengeth; the Lord revengeth, and is Furious. The Lord will take Vengeance on his Adverſaries; and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth Wrath for his Enemies.—And will not at all acquit the Wicked, the Lord hath his Way in the Whirlwind, and in the Storm, and the Clouds are the Duſt of his Feet. He rebuketh the Sea and maketh it Dry, and dryeth up all the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</hi> Baſhan <hi>languiſheth, and</hi> Carmel <hi>and the Flower of</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banon

               <hi>languiſheth. The Mountains quake at him, and the Hills melt, and the Earth is burnt at his Preſence; yea the World and all that dwell therein. Who can ſtand before his Indignation, and who can abide in the Fierceneſs of his Anger? His Fury is pour'd out like Fire, and the Rocks are thrown down by him!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as the Conſideration of God's Juſtice and Wrath, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters <hi>Terror</hi> to all the ungodly in General, ſo eſpecially and particularly to theſe following. viz. 1ſt. <hi>Epicures,</hi> who indulge a ſenſual Security, and put the Evil Day far from them. Surely ſuch treaſure up to themſelves Wrath, againſt the Day of Wrath, and the Revelation of the Righteous Judgment of God! Surely the Day of the Lord will be to them, as the Prophet expreſſeth it, <hi>cruel with Wrath and fierce Anger! (Iſa.</hi> xiii. 9.) And 2dly. <hi>All unjuſt</hi> Perſons who are guilty of Fraud in Contracts and Dealings with Men, or reſpecting of Perſons in Judgment (Jer. xxii. 13) <hi>Woe to him that buildeth his Houſe by Unrighteouſneſs, and his Chambers by Wrong.</hi>—Pſal lxxxii. 2, 5. 3dly. All <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,</hi> ſuch as are unjuſt to God and their own Souls, they cover their inward Injuſtice with an outward ſhew of Piety, ſuch are an Abomination to God, and may expect to be cut aſunder by the Sword of <hi>divine Juſtice,</hi> (Mat. 24. ult.) 4thly. All <hi>Murmerers,</hi> who call in Queſtion the Juſtice of God in his Judgments, and kick with the Heel againſt the moſt High, under Frowns of Providence. For this the whole Congregation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> fell in the Wilderneſs, and never ſaw <hi>Cannaan,</hi> two excepted. (<hi>Num.</hi> xiv. 27,—30.) Now the Uſe that I would adviſe poor graceleſs Sinners of every Age and Order, to make of the Juſtice of God, is to be excited by it to fly to Chriſt for Security and Defence. <hi>He is a hiding Place from the Wind, and a Covert from the Storm, (Iſa.</hi> 23.) <hi>He was made Sin for us, that we might be
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:005500_0292_1039657A2B655C18"/>
made the Righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi> In him God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has declared his Righteouſneſs, (<hi>Rom.</hi> iii. 25.) And him he is willing to make Righteouſneſs to ſuch as accept of him. (1. <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 30.) Well ſeeing divine Juſtice muſt be ſatisfy'd for the Wrong done by our Offences, either by us or a ſurety in our Place, or elſe we muſt periſh eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally: Then ſeeing we ourſelves cannot ſatisfy, becauſe we are poor, imperfect and finite Creatures, let us haſten to Chriſt and receive him by Faith, as the Goſpel offers him, that ſo we may be juſtified by Faith, and ſecurely reſt on and rejoice in that JESUS, who has fulfiled the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Law for his People. (<hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 3.) But</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. This Subject ſpeaks Comfort to all Believers in every of their Troubles: For from this they may ſee that they are afflicted leſs then their Iniquities deſerve, that a Fathers Love is the Spring of them, who chaſtens them, leaſt they ſhould be condemned with the World: And particularly we may draw Comfort from this Subject, under Calumnies and Wrongs, when we think that we ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hence is the Apoſtles Query, Rom. viii. 34, <hi>Who is he that condemneth, it is</hi> CHRIST <hi>that dyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there are theſe following Duties, which from the Conſideration of divine Juſtice, we ſhould be exhorted to perform, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. That we beware of depending upon our own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, upon the one Hand with the <hi>Phariſee, (Luk.</hi> xviii.
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:005500_0293_1039657856900040"/>
11.) And of the Neglect of Duty on the other with the Slugard, whoſe Hands refuſe to labour; <hi>for without Holineſs no Man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> Heb. xii. 14. 2dly. Let us walk with humble Reverence and Child-like fear before the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God, as with a conſuming Fire, avoiding every Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Evil, and continually in all our religious Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, eyeing JESUS the Mediator and Interceſſor, who is only able to cover their Defects, and render them accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to his Father by his abundant Righteouſneſs. In whom alone we are compleat and ſafe from every impending Storm: For when in him, the flaming Sword of divine Juſtice, which before kept us out of Paradiſe, guards and aſſiſts our Entrance into it! And</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. Let us glorify God on the Account of his Juſtice of every Kind, whether <hi>Eſſential</hi> or <hi>Declarative, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Judicatory, Legiſlative, Remunerative,</hi> or <hi>Vindictive;</hi> for tranſcendent Beauty ſhines therein. Let us ſay with the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> Pſ. lxxxix. 24. <hi>Juſtice and Judgment are the Habitation of thy Throne.</hi> And with <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> xi. 33. <hi>O the Depth of the Riches of the Wiſdom and Knowledge of God, his Judgments are unſearchable, and his Ways paſt find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out!</hi> Such is the Strictneſs of divine Juſtice in all his Proceedings, that it is compar'd to Mountains and to the Abyſs, Pſ. xxxvi. 6. <hi>Thy Righteouſneſs is as the great Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains thy Judgments are a great Deep.</hi> And let us join with the Inhabitants of Heaven in celebrating the Juſtice of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> xix 1.2. <hi>And after theſe Things I heard a great Voice of much People, in Heaven, ſaying</hi> Haleluja, Salvation, <hi>and</hi> Glory, <hi>and</hi> Honour, <hi>and</hi> Power <hi>unto the Lord our God, for true and Righteous are his Judgments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In fine, Let us labour to imitate the Juſtice and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God, by ſeeking the Righteouſneſs of CHRIST to our Juſtification, in the manner before expreſſed. Alſo by
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:005500_0294_10396576ABEA66B0"/>
ſeeking the Inherent Righteouſneſs which it pleaſed God at firſt to implant in our Natures by Creation (<hi>Ecleſ.</hi> vii. 29.) which we have loſt by Sin. I ſay let us fervently and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently cry to God by humble Supplications, in the Name of CHRIST, that he would be pleaſed to implant or infuſe into our Souls, by Regeneration, the Habits or Principles of that Righteouſneſs: And having the ſame implanted, let us exerciſe them in our whole Practice, 1ſt. <hi>Towards God,</hi> by rendering to him his Due, <hi>viz.</hi> our ſelves, and all that Honour, Love, Truſt and Service which he requires in his Word. And 2dly. <hi>Towards</hi> our <hi>Neighbour,</hi> In all Matters of Government, Judgment and Commerce, ruling without Oppreſſion, judging without reſpect of Perſons, and dealing without Fraud, Falſhood or Impoſition. And 3dly. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>ourſelves,</hi> in a right Improvement of the Seaſons of Mercy, thereby ſecuring our Salvation. And alſo in not ſufferring ourſelves to be wronged in our temporal Intereſt. A great Part of the Image of God and Beauty of Religion, conſiſts in Juſtice; and as the Bleſſing of God reſts upon ſuch here, ſo they ſhall receive from the juſt Judge of Heaven and Earth, a Crown of Righteouſneſs hereafter, which ſhall never fade away. That this may be the Happy Lot of us all, may God grant for CHRIST Sake. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>AFTER the Prophet had in the Preceeding Verſes, repreſented the bad Characters of the People of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> under the Similitude of an adulterous Wife, as well as the low Condition, they ſhould be reduc'd to on this Account, by their Captivity and other Inſtances of God's controverſy with them: He in the Words of our Text, propheſies of a bleſſed Reformation; that ſhould be wrought upon them <hi>in the latter Days.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the <hi>latter Days</hi> we are to underſtand the Days of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> or the Time of the Goſpel Diſpenſation, and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the latter Part of this Time: Then we are told, that the Jews ſhould reverence God, <hi>becauſe of his Goodneſs.</hi> We muſt admire and adore the Goodneſs of God, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did when this Name was proclaimed. (<hi>Ex.</hi> xxxiv. 6.) <q>And fear the Guilt of unkind Returns.</q> The Conſideration of God's Goodneſs, ſhould make us afraid of offending him, which ſo groſly violates the Laws of Gratitude. And hence the Pſalmiſt obſerves, <hi>that there is Forgiveneſs with God, that he may be fear'd.</hi> Pſ. cxxx. 4. This Propheſy had its Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment in the early Times of the Goſpel, when thro' the Bleſſing of God, upon the Miniſtry of the Apoſtles,
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:005500_0296_103965736923A1A8"/>
great Numbers both of Jews and Gentiles were brought to believe in JESUS. And hereby to fear God, becauſe of his <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> more eſpecially apparent in the Redemption of Mankind, by the Sufferings and Obedience of the Son of God the ſpiritual <hi>David!</hi> But ſome do probably (at leaſt) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a farther Accompliſhment of this Propheſy, in Time coming, agreeable to the Words of the Apoſtle, <hi>When the Fullneſs of the Gentiles is brought in, then all Iſrael ſhall be ſaved.</hi>

                  <item>II. Upon the <hi>Fear of God.</hi> And then proceed to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement.</item>

            <p>That God is truly and ſupreamly Good, the ſacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Teſtify various Ways, <hi>viz.</hi> 1ſt. <hi>Effectively,</hi> when it aſſerts that all the Works of God are good. <hi>Gen.</hi> i. 31. <hi>And God ſaw every Thing that he had made and behold it was very good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly. <hi>Figuratively,</hi> when it commemorates and commends the Riches of his Goodneſs. (<hi>Rom.</hi> ii. 4.)</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. <hi>Negatively,</hi> When it denies that there is any Evil in him. <hi>Pſ.</hi> xcii. 15. <hi>He is my Rock and there is no Unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in him. (Deut.</hi> xxxii. 4.)</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. <hi>Affirmatively,</hi> by expreſſly, aſſerting his Goodneſs. <hi>Pſ.</hi> xxv. 8. <hi>Good and upright is the Lord, therefore will he teach Sinners in the Way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Reaſon likewiſe confirms the ſame Truth, by aſſerting 1ſt. That God is a Being, and therefore Good: For <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Good</hi> are concertible Terms among Philoſophers: Yea that he is the firſt and chief Being, and therefore the firſt and chief Good. And 2dly. By aſſerting that God is perfect, and therefore deſirable and communicative, in which the Sum of Goodneſs conſiſts. Beſides as God is the Author of all that Good that is in
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:005500_0297_103965715EC68658"/>
Creatures, (for none of them has his Goodneſs of himſelf.) So he contains all the Kinds of Good in him, <hi>viz.</hi> Pleaſant, profitable, honeſt. In reſpect of <hi>pleaſant Good,</hi> the Pſalmiſt bids us <hi>taſte and ſee that he is good,</hi> Pſ. xxxiv. And he tells us <hi>that in his Preſence is fullneſs of Joy, and at his Right Hand Pleaſures for ever more, Pſ.</hi> xvi. 11. In reſpect of <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Good,</hi> he diffuſes his Kindneſs among his Creatures, and in poſſeſſing him we poſſeſs all beſides him, and more than all! In reſpect of <hi>honeſt Good,</hi> God is by his Sanctity the original Rule and Pattern, of all that Holineſs that is in Creatures. Hence ſayeth <hi>Auguſtine</hi> 
               <q>God only is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutably Good, he only is the Good of all Good, he only is the Cauſe of all Goodneſs, to all that are Good. There would be no communicable good Things (ſaid he) if there was not an incommunicable Good.</q> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God is Good in three Reſpects, viz. 1ſt. By his <hi>Eſſence,</hi> that is originally, the Foundation of Goodneſs, whereas Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are only good by Participation, as Streams running from the Fountain. 2dly. God is good by <hi>Efficiency,</hi> inaſmuch as he only can communicate Good independently, whereas Creatures only ſo far as they are aſſiſted by his Power, and excited by his Influence. 3dly. God is good by <hi>Exiſtence,</hi> inaſmuch as he only is a Good neceſſarily exiſting, whereas all Creatures are but contingently good, and exiſt by the meer Will and Pleaſure of God. This Truth the Gentile Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers acknowledged. <q>There is no good Mind without God, ſayeth Seneca.</q>
               <q>Vertue is not in us by Nature, but by divine Providence, ſayeth <hi>Plato.</hi>
               </q> The Jews were likewiſe of the ſame Sentiment. Hence <hi>Philo, one is good</hi> meaning God, who was wont to be call'd by them <q>one without Addition.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In diſcourſing upon this <hi>Attribute</hi> of divine Goodneſs, I ſhall enquire into its <hi>Nature, Kinds</hi> and <hi>Properties,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:005500_0298_1039656FDB4C9238"/>
the Force of ſome <hi>Objections</hi> againſt it, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the <hi>Improvement,</hi> after ſome brief Hints premis'd, reſpecting the other general Head of Diſcourſe, <hi>viz. The Fear of God,</hi> And</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. <hi>Good</hi> according to <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Definition, is that which all deſire. But it is more accurately defin'd by others, thus, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That it is that which for the Perfection of its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deſerves to be deſired, and is communicative of itſelf.</q> So that three Things are included in it <hi>viz.</hi> 1ſt. An eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial <hi>Excellency</hi> or Perfection, for which it merits Deſire and purſuit. 2dly. A <hi>Faculty</hi> of communicating this Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to others, on this Account its call'd profitable. And 3dly. The <hi>Relation</hi> of both the Former to the Appetite or Deſire, on which Account it is call'd deſireable. And hence ſome learned Men obſerve that Good is threefold, <hi>viz. Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical, Phyſical, Ethical.</hi> Or in more plain Terms, it may be call'd a <hi>Good</hi> of Being, Uſe and Manners. And 1ſt. <hi>Metaphyſical Good,</hi> or the Good of Being, is that Perfection, which is communicated to every Being by its Cauſe, or it is that Excellency which every Being obtains, as it is a Being: For which it may be deſir'd. This has no Evil oppos'd to it, and only ſerves to ſhew the Pre-eminence of Exiſtence, to Non-Exiſtence, or Being to no Being. 2dly. <hi>Phyſical Good,</hi> or the Good of Uſe, is that Perfection or Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, by which any being deſign'd for another's Uſe, is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for it, whether the Uſe be General or Particular! Every Creature in its original Conſtitution was fitted for this two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Uſe, it not only ſerv'd to compleat and adorn the whole Syſtem of Things, but alſo for Food, or Medicine, or ſome of the Uſes of human Life: And in this Senſe all Things at their Creation were call'd <hi>Good;</hi> and to this Kind of Good is oppos'd, whatſoever is Un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it, Unprofitable, or Hurtful. 3d. <hi>Ethical</hi> or <hi>moral Good,</hi> or the Good of Manners, conſiſts
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:005500_0299_103966BEF7D117D0"/>
in the <hi>Rectitude</hi> of a reaſonable Creature, or in its <hi>Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> to <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Law;</hi> and to this Vice and Sin is oppos'd: And hence we call a holy Man, a <hi>good Man:</hi> and on the Contrary one who goes on in a Courſe of Sinning a <hi>Bad-Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having offer'd theſe few Hints concerning the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Nature of Good, I proceed to obſerve more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerning the divine Goodneſs, that it is no other then his Perfection, by which he can communicate himſelf, and for which he deſerves and ought to be deſir'd, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it includes theſe three following Particulars in it, namely 1ſt. His infinite <hi>Perfection,</hi> which appears to us from all his Attributes, by which he is ſufficient for himſelf, and his Creatures, and that to infinite Bleſſedneſs. (<hi>Gen.</hi> xvii. 1.) By this he is good in himſelf, yea Goodneſs itſelf. (<hi>Pſa.</hi> xxv. 8.) And free from every Evil. (<hi>Deut.</hi> xxxii. 4.) And 2dly. A <hi>Faculty</hi> to <hi>communicate himſelf</hi> when and how he pleaſes: Hence he is call'd <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Beneficient,</hi> (Pſa. cxix. 68.) <hi>Thou art Good and doeſt Good, teach me thy Statutes.</hi> 3dly. A <hi>Relation</hi> or <hi>Suitableneſs,</hi> which ariſes from the two former Particulars mentioned, for which the Almighty deſerves to be ſought after, and deſir'd by all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Beings, with the utmoſt Intenſeneſs and Vehemence. <hi>Pſ.</hi> lxiii. 1.2. <hi>O God thou art my God, early will I ſeek thee, my Soul thirſteth for thee.—To ſee thy Power and thy Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as I have ſeen thee in the Sanctuary.</hi> But I proceed to conſider the</p>
            <p n="2">2d. Propos'd, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Kinds of divine Goodneſs.</hi> And here it may be obſerv'd, that the Goodneſs of God is Two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, viz. <hi>Imanent,</hi> and <hi>Tranſient,</hi> or <hi>Eſſential</hi> and <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</hi> Now God's <hi>Imanent</hi> or <hi>eſſential Goodneſs,</hi> is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then his perfect Eſſence or Being. Whereas the <hi>tranſient Goodneſs</hi> of God, conſiſts in the Manifeſtation of the Former to, or in created Beings, and is Three-fold
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:005500_0300_103966BD572FBAE0"/>
               <hi>viz, Univerſal, Common</hi> and <hi>Special.</hi> And 1ſt. The <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal tranſient Goodneſs</hi> of God, is that whereby he cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates, ſupports, governs, and beautifies all Creatures, Pſa. cxlvii. 8.9. <hi>Sing unto the Lord with Thanksgiving, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oereth the Heaven with Clouds, who prepareth Rain for the Earth, who maketh Graſs to grow upon the Mountains. He giveth to the Beaſt his Food, and to the young Ravens which Cry.</hi> Pſa. xxxvi. 6, 7. <hi>O Lord thou preſerveſt Man and Beaſt, how excellent is thy loving Kindneſs O God! Therefore the Children of Men put their Truſt under the Shadow of thy Wings.</hi> 2dly. God's <hi>Common Goodneſs</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in conferring common Benefits upon the Children of Men without Diſtinction, whether they be Elect or Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates: And hence God is call'd the Saviour of all Men, eſpecially of thoſe that believe. (1 Tim. iv. 10. See alſo Rom. ii. 4.) And 3dly. The <hi>ſpecial Goodneſs</hi> of God conſiſts in diſpenſing ſaving Gifts upon the Elect. Epheſ, i. 3, 4. <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord</hi> JESUS CHRIST <hi>who hath Bleſſed us with all ſpiritual Bleſſings in heavenly Places in Chriſt, according as he hath choſen us in him, before the Foundation of the World, that we ſhould be Holy, and without Blame before him in Love.</hi> And hence we read in Scripture of the Faith of God's Elect, and the Things that do accompany Salvation. The</p>
            <p n="3">3d. Propos'd comes next to be conſidered, which was to diſcourſe upon the <hi>Properties of divine Goodneſs:</hi> Now the <hi>imanent,</hi> or <hi>eſſential Goodneſs</hi> of God, hath the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Properties, <hi>viz.</hi> 1ſt. It is <hi>Great, Nehe.</hi> ix. 25. <hi>So they did Eat and became Fat, and delighted themſelves in thy great Goodneſs.</hi> Whereas the Goodneſs of Creatures, is but as the Drop of a Bucket, Iſa. xl. 15. 2dly. The Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God is <hi>Unlimited</hi> and <hi>Infinite,</hi> equally uncapable of Addition, as of Diminution, tranſcending the utmoſt Verge
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:005500_0301_103966BB89B5A050"/>
of our Speech or Thought! Whereas the Goodneſs of all Creatures is finite and limited. And hence the Love of CHRIST is ſaid to <hi>paſs Knowledge,</hi> and he is ſaid to be <hi>able to do abundantly above all that we aſk or think. Epheſ.</hi> iii, 19.20. Pſa. lvii. 10. <hi>For thy Mercy is great unto the Heavens, and thy Truth unto the Clouds.</hi> 3dly. The <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Goodneſs</hi> of God is without <hi>Beginning, Succeſſion</hi> and <hi>End:</hi> Whereas the Goodneſs of Creatures as it hath a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, ſo it hath Succeſſion in Duration, and either has or can have an End. 1 Chron. xvi. 34. <hi>O give thanks to the Lord, for he is Good, for his Mercy endureth forever!</hi> 4thly. The <hi>imanent Goodneſs</hi> of God is moſt <hi>Simple,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Mixture of Imperfection or Defect, it is pure Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs without the leaſt Alay: And hence he is ſaid to <hi>be Light, in which there is no Darkneſs at all,</hi> 1 Joh. i. 5. Whereas in Creatures there is no Goodneſs without Imperfection, at leaſt Comparative. 5thly. The <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant,</hi> becauſe it is his Being, and hence he is call'd <hi>the Fountain of Life,</hi> Pſa. xxxvi. 9. Whereas the Goodneſs of Creatures is ſomething added to their Being, and ſo acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and ſeparable. God is Good originally by his own Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; whereas all Creatures are good by Participation: They have but a deriv'd Dependant, and precarious Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: They themſelves are like <hi>to Vanity, whoſe Days are as a Shadow, that paſſeth away, Pſ.</hi> cxliv. 4. And how can their Goodneſs. which is but a quality ſuperaded to their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, be more Stable then they on whom it depends? But</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. The <hi>Tranſient Goodneſs</hi> of <hi>God</hi> which is the Cauſe of all that Goodneſs which exiſts in Creatures, may be ſaid to have the following Properties, <hi>viz.</hi> 1ſt. It is <hi>Efficient,</hi> inaſmuch as every Creature receives its Goodneſs therefrom. <hi>Jam.</hi> i. 17. <hi>Every good Gift, and every perfect Donation, is from above, and cometh down from the Father of Lights,
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:005500_0302_103966B9E46A76C8"/>
with whom is no Variableneſs or Shadow of turning.</hi> 2dly. The <hi>tranſient Goodneſs</hi> of God, is <hi>exemplary;</hi> as it is the Fountain from which all created Goodneſs flows, ſo it is the <hi>Patern</hi> according to which it is to be regulated: And hence we are bid to <hi>be Merciful as our heavenly Father is Merciful. Jehovah</hi> repreſents his infinite Perfection as it were by Parts in his Works; as reaſonable Creatures bear its Image, <hi>Gen.</hi> i. 26. So even the irrational Creation car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry more obſcure Footſteps, as it were, thereof! 3dly. The <hi>tranſient Goodneſs</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is <hi>Final,</hi> Pro. x. vi 4 The Lord <hi>hath made all Things for himſelf,</hi> ſays <hi>Solomon. Of him, and thro' him, and to him are all Things,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, Rom. xi. 36. All created Beings do either Labour after God, or are directed to his Glory paſſively. But I paſs on to the</p>
            <p n="4">4th. General Head, which was to conſider ſome <hi>Objections</hi> againſt this Attribute. And 1ſt. It is objected, that God hath ſaid he will ſhew himſelf froward with the Froward <hi>Pſ.</hi> xviii. 26. <hi>Anſ.</hi> the Scope of the Place is only to ſignify that God will accommodate his Righteous judgments, to the perverſe Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of obſtinate Tranſgreſſors. He will proportion Pains to their Preſumptuous Impieties, and thus wherein they dealt proudly he will be above them.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. It is objected, that God is not deſired by all, nay that many labour to baniſh the Thoughts of him out of their Minds. <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is true, but the Reaſon why he is not ſought after by all intelligent Beings, is not any want of Goodneſs in him, but the <hi>Blindneſs</hi> of Creatures, whereby they diſcern not his Tranſcendent Amiableneſs, or their <hi>Guilt,</hi> whereby they fear and ſhun him, as Criminals an avenging Judge! A</p>
            <p n="3">3d, Objection is this, That God does not impart his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to all, to Reprobates; whereas Goodneſs is communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of itſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="300" facs="unknown:005500_0303_103966B7EC4CCA30"/>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> He does communicate his Goodneſs to all, but freely, according to his own good Pleaſure, in reſpect of the <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>degree</hi> of <hi>Good.</hi> He is Lord of his own Treaſures, and may do with them what he pleaſes, without being account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to any. For as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> obſerves, <hi>Who hath firſt given to him, and it ſhall be recompenſed to him again?</hi> God is ſo far Good to all, that he ſupports, preſerves and nouriſhes them ſo long as they continue, and confers upon them whatever they enjoy, and that without their demerit. But he is by his Eſſence Good, and therefore cannot but be averſe to evil, and thoſe that are under the Government of it: And therefore cannot have Fellowſhip with them, while they continue ſuch. But it is time to conſider the</p>
            <p n="2">2d General Head of Diſcourſe, viz. <hi>the Fear of God.</hi> Which may be thus deſcrib'd, viz. <hi>That it is a Reverence of God, ariſing from a View of his Attributes, and a Senſe of his Love, diſpoſing us to honourable Sentiments of Jehovah in our Minds, as well as to expreſs the ſame by our Lips, and eſpecially by the courſe of our Practice, to do thoſe Things that we know are pleaſing to him, and carefully to avoid the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</hi> Here obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. That there can be no true <hi>Fear of God</hi> without the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of him. And this Knowledge muſt be experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental and practical, ſuch as is formed in us by the Holy Spirit's ſpecial Concurrence, with the uſe of proper Means. Such as proceeds from Faith in God thro' a Mediator, and has influence upon the Mind and Life! When we have a believing View of the infinite Excellency of the ſupream Being by Faith, then, and not before, we are inclin'd to entertain high and becoming Thoughts of God, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the ſame in our Speech and Behaviour. And</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. It ſhould be obſerv'd, that <hi>Love</hi> is another <hi>Principle</hi> of the true <hi>Fear of God.</hi> Our Love to God proceeds partly
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:005500_0304_103966B6692ED8C0"/>
from a view of his Excellency, and partly from a Senſe of his Love to us. Hence the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> obſerves, that <hi>we love him, becauſe he loved us firſt.</hi> Now a tranſcendent Love to God, ſweetly conſtrains us, by the ingenuous Bonds of Gratitude, to <hi>fear God</hi> becauſe of his Goodneſs, as our Text aſſerts. But particularly in the</p>
            <p n="3">3d Place it may be obſerv'd, that there be two ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients in the aforeſaid <hi>Reverence of God,</hi> viz. a <hi>fear to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend</hi> him by any Sin, and a <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to pleaſe</hi> him by every Duty; on which Account the whole Worſhip of God is ſometimes in Scripture ſignify'd by <hi>the fear of God.</hi> Hence it is ſaid of <hi>Job, that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eared God, and eſchewed Evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the <hi>fear of God</hi> is twofold, viz. either <hi>Servile</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Filial.</hi> The <hi>Servile Fear of God,</hi> is when we are afraid to offend God, chiefly becauſe of the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> conſequent upon it. And this, when it is attended with ſome Hope of Mercy, is profitable, as a preparative of Order to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, but when accompany'd with Deſpair, it is hurtful. But a <hi>filial fear</hi> ariſes from Love, and ſweetly allures us to ſerve God, and makes us afraid of his Anger as ingenuous Children. The Characters of this Kind of Fear, are theſe following. 1ſt. It makes thoſe that have it Conſcientious in the general Courſe of their Practice, to avoid every Evil, ſecret as well as open, ſmall as well as great, faſhionable and creditable Evils, as well as thoſe that are more ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous! Yea <hi>to avoid the very Appearance of Evil,</hi> and to ſeek the Mortification of Sin in the Heart; and all this from a hatred of Sin, chiefly becauſe of its vile Nature, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety to God. 2dly.

it makes Perſons that have it, to long after, and labour for a Perfection of Holineſs: From purſuing which they will not be deter'd by the Fear or Hope of any Creature, or of any Evil! 3dly. Thoſe that fear God make mention of his Name and Attributes with religious Reverence, and read his Word with pious Solicitude. 4thly. The <hi>Fear of God</hi> is not a tranſient <hi>Pang</hi> or <hi>ſuddain flaſh of Devotion,</hi> but a <hi>fixed good Temper of Mind,</hi> a habitual Devotedneſs to God and his Service, which runs thro' the general Courſe of our Affections and Actions.</p>

(<hi>Mat.</hi> xxv. 41.) It is <hi>Sin</hi> that robs the Soul of the good Image of God, with which it was at firſt adorn'd, and renders it evil and indiſpos'd to any good. It is <hi>Sin</hi> that inclines thoſe that are under its Government, to prefer the imaginary Goodneſs of the Creature, to the true and infinite Goodneſs of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor! It is by <hi>Sin,</hi> that we requite the chief good from whom all ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Reſpect. If we regard ſmall Rays and Drops of the Divine Goodneſs in Creatures, how much more ſhould we regard the Sun itſelf and love with all our Souls that infinite and unexhauſted Fountain of Goodneſs that is in God. <q>Love, ſaith <hi>Anſelm,</hi> the one Good, in whom are all Good Things, and it ſhall ſuffice thee.</q> Now our Love to the good God ſhould expreſs itſelf, in longing after Union to, communion with, and the Enjoyment of God in this and the next Life, as well as in acquieſcing in his Goodneſs, as in our All, and only Good, not deſiring the Almighty to be in any Reſpect otherwiſe than he is. <hi>Pſ.</hi> lxxiii. 25. <hi>Whom have in I Heaven but thee, and there is none upon Earth that I deſire beſides thee.</hi> Our Love ſhould likewiſe diſpoſe us to devote all our good to God, and employ it for him, as well as to remove all moral Evil from his Sight, that ſo he may make all his Goodneſs paſs before us. (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> viii. 5. <hi>Iſa.</hi> i. 16. <hi>Ex.</hi> xxxiii. 19.) And ſeeing Jehovah is truly Good, our Love to him ſhould be ſincere, not in Speech and Carriage only, but in Heart, <hi>Love out of a pure Heart and Faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned, Love in Deed and in Truth,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it. For nothing but this will avail us at laſt; and ſeeing God is the only Good, <hi>ſuperlatively, independently, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutably</hi> and <hi>efficiently Good.</hi> Therefore we ſhould neglect and contemn every other Good, ſo far as it ſtands in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with him. <hi>Cant.</hi> viii. 7. <hi>Many Waters cannot quench Love, neither can the Floods drown it. If a Man would give all the Subſtance of his Houſe for Love, it would be utterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned.</hi> And we muſt love the ſuperlative Good ſuperla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, or in the higheſt degree, <hi>with all our Soul and Strengh,</hi> above any Thing in Heaven or Earth, becauſe Jehovah is the chief Good infinitely tranſcending every other Good. And ſhould not we love him <hi>independently,</hi> i. e. for himſelf alone, and not for any Thing elſe chiefly, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch
<pb n="305" facs="unknown:005500_0308_103966AFCAD12E28"/>
as he is an independent Good, who has made all Things for himſelf. Moreover ſhould not that good Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, be lov'd <hi>conſtantly</hi> with an invariable and unfailing Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; who is himſelf far from the Shadow of Change? And ſhould not our Love to Jehovah be <hi>operative</hi> and <hi>effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,</hi> not in Word and Tongue only, but in Deed and Truth? Seeing he is a good Communicative of himſelf to his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures! Now in order to obtain ſuch a Love to God, as has been hinted, it would be of ſpecial Service, to meditate frequently upon the Goodneſs of God, which fills the Earth and reaches up to Heaven, which appears with wonderful Luſtre in the Works of Creation, Redemption and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence? Is not the Miſers Love to Gold enflamed by a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent viewing of it? And let us dear Brethren humbly pray, and earneſtly labour to be more and more firmly fix'd, in the believing Perſwaſion of God's infinite Goodneſs; that ſo CHRIST may dwell in our Hearts by Faith, that being rooted and grounded in Love, <hi>we may be able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the Breadth, and Length, and Depth, and Height, and to know the Love of CHRIST, which paſſes Knowledge, that we may be filled with the Fullneſs of God.</hi> Eph. iii. 17,—19.

Do we need <hi>Honeſt</hi> and <hi>ſaving Good, Faith, Hope, Charity, &amp;c.</hi> Is not God the Father of Lights, from whom every good Gift is deriv'd? Let us not therefore dear Brethren, turn to empty Creatures, and <hi>make to ourſelves Ciſterns that can hold no Water,</hi> and ſay, <hi>who ſhall ſhew us any Good?</hi> But to the living God, and from him let us labour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive all the Good we need for Life and Godlineſs, by Faith in the Mediator, in whom all the Promiſes are <hi>Yea and Amen,</hi> and likewiſe by earneſt Prayer and humble Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence as well as by a ſweet Complacence in, or content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs with the Good, that God is pleaſed to diſpence to us, by the Courſe of his unerring Providence. In God's Goodneſs our Happineſs is to be only ſought: For indeed it can be only found therein. Here we may behold our <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective</hi> Happineſs, or that Good that makes us happy: Not a created Good as ſome <hi>Philoſophers</hi> of old, have vainly dream'd. No! But an uncreated, independent and infinite Good, who as a <hi>Shield</hi> can turn away all Evil from us, and as a Sun can communicate all Good to us. And here we may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe behold our <hi>Formal</hi> Happineſs, which conſiſts in Union to, Communion with, and the Enjoyment of this chief and infinite Good. Hence the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> pronounces <hi>that People bleſſed whoſe God is the Lord.</hi> (Pſal. xxxiii. 12.) And how ſweetly does devout <hi>Heman</hi> triumph, on this Account, Pſa. lxxii. 25. <hi>Who have I in Heaven but thee, and there is none upon Earth that I deſire beſides thee.</hi> The chief Good hath certainly the chief Dignity and Excellency, and therefore deſerves the firſt Place in our Thoughts, Deſires and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. And is not ſecuring of Happineſs the great Deſign
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:005500_0310_103966AC73DB5460"/>
Life, next to the Glory of God, after which there is in all a natural Deſire. Now is it not evident from the very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Things, that that cannot be found in any created Good? Becauſe it is groſs and limited, and ſo unequal to the Nature and Deſires of the Soul. Surely therefore all the Lines of Life, that do not tend to God as their Center are crooked, and beſides the Mark. Let us then turn our Eyes and Hearts from Creatures to the great and good God, and ſeek for Reſt and Happineſs in him alone; his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs can only yield the ſolid Satisfaction we in vain ſeek and expect elſewhere.</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. The infinite Goodneſs of God, affords Occaſion of glorifying him after the Example of many of his moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Servants, particularly of <hi>David,</hi> Pſa. cvi. 1. <hi>Praiſe ye the Lord, O give Thanks unto the Lord, for he is good, for his Mercy endureth forever.</hi> Of <hi>Aſaph, Heman, Jeduthun,</hi> who with their Sons and Brethren, by Cymbals, &amp; Trumpets, and other Inſtruments of Muſick, ſounded forth the Praiſes of the divine Goodneſs. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> v. 12, 13. <hi>And it came to paſs as the Trumpeters and Singers were as one, to make one Sound to be heard in praiſing and thanking the Lord, and when they lift up their Voice with the Trumpets and Cymbals, and praiſed the Lord ſaying, for he is good for his Mercy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth for ever; that then the Houſe was filled with a Cloud, even the Houſe of the Lord.</hi> And is there not Reaſon why we ſhould praiſe God for his Goodneſs, when we conſider that it is a Property, whereby he eſpecially communicates and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends himſelf to Creatures, a Property which moſt nearly touches us, &amp; therefore ſhould conſtrain us to grateful Emotions. Hence ſaith <hi>Auguſtine,</hi>
               <q>Seeing that God is Good. and hath made all Things Good, and ſeeing that he who made all Things, is infinitely better than the Things which he made, you will not be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="308" facs="unknown:005500_0311_103966AAF2173E00"/>
To the ſame effect ſpeaks <hi>Bernard</hi> thus, <q>As there is not a Moment in which we enjoy not God's Goodneſs; ſo let there be no Moment in which we do not remember God as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</q> Is not the Praiſes of God for his Goodneſs the ſweeteſt Employment of the Saints in Heaven or Earth? Says <hi>Auguſtine</hi> 
               <q>I am ſeiz'd with Sweetneſs while I think upon the good God.—If therefore we Praiſe any other Thing, we therefore Praiſe it becauſe it is Good; there can be no greater, better or firmer Cauſe of Praiſing God, than becauſe he is Good.</q> Now in order to glorify God, it is neceſſary that we know his Goodneſs, in its <hi>Nature, Kinds, Degrees, Effects.</hi> And likewiſe that we taſte, behold and admire the ſame! that ſo what we feel in our Hearts, we may expreſs with our Lips, in the <hi>Pſalmiſts</hi> Language. Pſal. ciii. 2. <hi>Bleſs the Lord O my Soul, and forget not all his Benefits!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in the next Place, let me intreat you, my dear Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, to imitate the Goodneſs of God. The Pſalmiſt gives us a ſummary of the divine Goodneſs, Pſal. cxix 68. <hi>Thou art Good and doeſt Good,</hi> i. e. Good by an intrinſick and imanent Perfection, in which reſpect God is lovely and lov'd by himſelf, as well as communicative of himſelf, and ſo to be deſired by all. Beſides he does Good, he diſtributes his Goodneſs among Creatures both Good and Evil, tho' in a different Manner and Degree. Now let us endeavour to imitate this noble Example. 1ſt. By being Good, i. e. fit for the uſe to which we were created; and what was that Uſe, but to <hi>know, love</hi> and <hi>glorify</hi> our Creator here, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to enjoy him eternally! And what does <hi>fitneſs</hi> for it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in, but in the Image of God, after which Man was at firſt created, <hi>viz.</hi> The Wiſdom of the Underſtanding, the Holineſs and Righteouſneſs of the Will, and Harmony of the Affections! (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> iv. 24) Now this Image of God
<pb n="309" facs="unknown:005500_0312_103966A931517918"/>
or original Righteouſneſs being loſt, by our Violation of the Covenant of Works, we are thereby render'd <hi>unprofitable Servants,</hi> unfit for our Uſe, and ſo altogether Evil. And therefore before we can imitate God aright, we muſt obtain, by Regeneration, the Image of God, which we have loſt by Sin. And being Regenerated we muſt more and more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon Evil, and learn to do Well, by progreſſive Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. 2dly. After we are made Good, we muſt endeavour to do Good, agreeable to the Deſign or Uſe of our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Towards God,</hi> by fearing of him, truſting in him, by Love and Obedience: <hi>Towards our Neighbour,</hi> by diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing our Goodneſs upon all, Good and Bad, Friends and Enemies, but not in a like Degree: By this Imitation of the divine Goodneſs, we ſhall ſhew ourſelves to be the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Children of our Father which is in Heaven: By this we ſhall have a certain Argument within ourſelves, of our Reſtoration to the divine Image: And by this we ſhall reſemble the bleſſed God in his moſt perfect Property, and ſo be made Partakers of the divine Nature! By this we ſhall glorify Jehovah's Name, and many Ways promote his Kingdom: And by this, thro the gracious Promiſe of God, our Comforts will be encreaſed in this Life, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of our Happineſs in that to come.</p>
            <p>What was ſaid before concerning the <hi>Fear of God,</hi> ſhould excite you my dear Brethren, to examine yourſelves impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially thereby: for thus you will know your preſent State towards God, whether it be good or bad, which ye cannot but know is of great importance, both to your Comfort and Safety.</p>
            <p>I muſt beſeech you, Sirs, as a Meſſenger of God, and command you in his Name and by his Authority, to fear Jehovah. To this ye may be excited by the following Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, 1ſt. It is equal and Reaſonable: If Reverence and
<pb n="310" facs="unknown:005500_0313_103966A72C8E99D8"/>
Fear belongs to any, ſurely much more to the greateſt and beſt of Beings! 2dly. It is <hi>Safe.</hi> He that fears God need f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> none elſe! 3dly. It is <hi>proffitable:</hi> This is <hi>the Beginning of ſaving Wiſdom,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerves, and the Root and Spring of all Vertue and Goodneſs. To this the Promiſes of God are made, and to ſuch his Mercy and Goodneſs is extended! 4thly. It is <hi>generous</hi> and <hi>grateful.</hi> His Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs muſt induce us to fear walking unworthy of it, if we are not loſt to all Senſe of Gratitude! Now the Means that are helpful to the aforeſaid Diſpoſition are theſe, 1ſt. A fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent <hi>Meditation</hi> upon the Majeſty and Goodneſs of God. 2dly. Upon our <hi>Corruption</hi> and propenſity to Sin againſt him. 3dly. Upon the <hi>Baſeneſs</hi> of the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> and its <hi>dreadful Conſequences!</hi> 4thly. Upon the <hi>Omniſcience, Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipreſence, Power</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God, as an avenger of Sin. O may it pleaſe Almighty God to fullfil in us all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Promiſes our Text contains, that we may ſo <hi>fear the Lord and his Goodneſs in the latter Days:</hi> That having ſerved our Generation according to the Will of God, during the Space appointed for our Reſidence in this Vale of Sorrow, we may be at laſt tranſlated to that Kingdom of Peace, of Love, of Light, of Purity, of Reſt, where divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs appears in all its native Majeſty, in all its inexpreſſible Beauty, without an intercepting Glaſs, that ſo we may be forever with the Lord. <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>

            <p>IN the preceeding Verſes we are inform'd, that the Lord commanded <hi>Moſes</hi> to hew out two Tables of Stone, like to the firſt, which were broken, and to come to Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> with them the next Morning. <hi>Moſes</hi> readily obey'd the divine Injunction, and had a gracious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview of God. No ſooner had he reach'd the Top, the ſummit of <hi>Sinai's</hi> Mount, but the Lord deſcended in a Cloud, and proclaimed his Name! The Cloud was doubtleſs ſome ſenſible Symbol or Token of the divine Preſence! Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Jehovah made a Cloud his Pavilion in order to affect <hi>Moſes</hi> with with an awful Reverence of his Majeſty and Glory, and to let him know, that tho' ſomewhat of God was reveal'd to him, yet that much more was conceal'd from him! But from the whole we may learn this profitable Leſſon, viz. <hi>That it is only in the Way of Obedience that we can reaſonably expect the Intimations of God's gracious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence!</hi> In the Words of our Text it is more particularly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, <hi>that the Lord proclaimed his Name:</hi> Doubtleſs this Repetition is to ſignify to us, the great Importance of the Thing ſpoken. Now in the Proclamation two Things may
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:005500_0315_103966A3E8D44540"/>
be taken Notice of, viz. the <hi>Manner</hi> and <hi>Matter</hi> of it. And 1ſt. As to the <hi>Manner</hi> or Time, it was while <hi>the Lord paſſed by before him.</hi> The Apprehenſions we have of God in this World are ſhort and tranſient, full and fixed Views are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd for a future State. But 2dly. The <hi>Matter</hi> of the Proclamation contains a Repreſentation both of the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Goodneſs of God. And 1ſt. We have an Account of the Greatneſs of God in theſe Words, <hi>The Lord, the Lord God.</hi> As God hath his Being of himſelf, and is the Fountain of Being to all Creatures, ſo he is a Strong God, the great Original of all Power. This Declaration of God's Self-Exiſtence and Almightineſs, is prefix'd before the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of his Goodneſs, to excite a Fear and Reverence of God's Majeſty, and thereby to deter from an abuſe of his Mercy. In the 2d Place, we have an Account of God's Goodneſs, in three noble Inſtances, namely, of <hi>Mercy, Grace</hi> and <hi>Long-Sufferring.</hi> As God's Greatneſs is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to incite Fear, and prevent the abuſe of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: ſo is his Goodneſs diſplay'd to incite Hope, which is the Spring of Action, and to allay the Terror of his Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! The firſt Manifeſtation of divine Goodneſs here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd is Mercy; he is <hi>Merciful,</hi> this ſpeaks his compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Tenderneſs over poor miſerable Creatures, like that of a Father to his Children. This is put firſt, becauſe it is the firſt Wheel in all the Inſtances of God's good Will to fallen Man, whoſe Miſery makes him an Object of Pity, <hi>Jud.</hi> x. 16. 2dly. He is <hi>Gracious:</hi> This ſpeaks the Freeneſs of God's Goodneſs to his Creatures, and that it is vouchſaf'd entirely becauſe of his own good Pleaſure, and not for the Sake of any Thing in them. It is oppos'd to the Payment of a Price (<hi>Exo.</hi> xxi. 11.) as well as to Juſtice and Merit. (<hi>Pſal</hi> xxxv. 7, 19. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xix. 5.) 3dly.

to anger, and his deferring the Execution of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Vengeance upon Tranſgreſſors. Thus God waits to be Gracious to us, and wants to be exalted that he may have Mercy upon us! The Almighty now perform'd what he had but a little time before promiſed to <hi>Moſes.</hi> Ex. xxiii. 18 <hi>And he ſaid, I beſeech thee to ſhew me thy Glory, and he ſaid I will make all my Goodneſs to paſs before thee, and I will Proclaim the Name of the Lord before thee, and will be Gracious to whom I will be Gracious, and will ſhew Mercy on whom I will ſhew Mercy.</hi> By which we may ſee, that God's Goodneſs is his Name and Glory! that by which he will be known by his intelligent Creatures, as Men are by their Names, and that in which he Triumphs and has Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency! God had before made himſelf known to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Glory of his Self-Exiſtence and Self-Sufficiency, by the Name I AM THAT I AM; and now he makes himſelf known by the Glory of his <hi>Mercy, Grace</hi> and <hi>Long-ſuffering.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that I may diſcourſe diſtinctly upon thoſe <hi>three Attributes</hi> of God, which our Text contains, I ſhall begin with the firſt, which is <hi>his Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Holy Scriptures frequently aſſert the Mercy of God. Thus he is call'd <hi>the Father of Mercies,</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 3.) He is likewiſe ſaid <hi>to be abundant in Mercy,</hi> (1 Pet. i. 3.) <hi>Rich in Mercy,</hi> (Eph. ii. 4.) <hi>Of tender Mercy,</hi> (Pſ. xxv. 6.) <hi>to have Bowels of Mercy,</hi> (Pſa. xl. 11. Luk. i. 78.) Seeing that Mercy among Men, is among the Number of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and Perfections, in which Perſons of a more generous Mind and Temper generally excell; it cannot with any ſhadow of Reaſon be denied to God, who is not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely Perfect in himſelf, but alſo the Author of all that Good, that Creatures Poſſeſs! If any ſhould object and ſay,
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:005500_0317_103966A047B6C310"/>
               <hi>That Mercy is oppos'd to Juſtice, and therefore cannot be aſcrib'd to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I deny it, it is not op<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s'd to Juſtice, as the Verſe following our Text ſhews, <hi>keeping Mercy for Thouſands, and yet will by no Means clear the Guilty.</hi> God never ſhews Mercy contrary to Juſtice, as he never exerciſes Juſtice contrary to Mercy; yea the Almighty ſeldom or never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutes Juſtice without ſome Preceeding Expenſe of Mercy, and therefore by pitying the miſerable, the Lord doth not contradict his Juſtice, but as it were exceed it. As if a Creditor gave a Debtor a Hundred Pounds, who owes a Thouſand. It is in this Senſe that the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, <hi>That Mercy rejoyceth againſt Judgment, (Jam.</hi> ii. 13.) 2dly. Some do object, <hi>That Mercy cannot be aſcrib'd to God, becauſe it implies a Senſe of anothers Miſery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is true, Mercy is not in God, as it is in Men, by Way of Quality or Paſſion! For then his Simplicity and Happineſs would be deſtroyed. However ſuch a Knowledge of the Miſery of Creatures belongs to God, as inclines him to relive them! This <hi>Anſelm</hi> ſpeaks pertinently upon in the following Manner,
<q>Thou art Merciful O God according to us, and according to thee.—When thou beholds our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries we feel the Effect of Pity, but thou doſt not feel the Affection of Pity!</q>
            </p>
            <p>In diſcourſing upon this divine Attribute of Mercy it will be neceſſary to ſpeak upon its <hi>Nature, Kinds</hi> and <hi>Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi> And</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Mercy, in reſpect of its <hi>Nature,</hi> may be thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd, <hi>viz. That it is the Goodneſs of God, extended to the Miſerable.</hi> Here good and bad Angels are excluded. The Good becauſe they are not miſerable, and the Bad becauſe they are wholly given up to Juſtice, 2 Pet. ii. 4. <hi>But God ſpared not the Angels that ſinned, but caſt them down to
<pb n="315" facs="unknown:005500_0318_1039669EC554DE40"/>
Hell, and delivered them into Chains of Darkneſs to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd unto Judgment.</hi> Or the Mercy of God may be thus deſcrib'd, viz. <hi>That it is that Property of the Supream Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereby he is inclin'd to ſuccour his Creatures in Miſery, together with its kind Effects upon them.</hi> Here obſerve 1ſt. That the ſpecial Object of Mercy, is the Creature in Miſery, and thus it is diſtinguiſh'd from other Attributes. Goodneſs conſiders it's Object as <hi>Indigent,</hi> and ſo commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates needed Benefits; but Mercy conſiders its Object as <hi>Miſerable,</hi> becauſe of Sin: And therefore tho' an Innocent Creature be the Object of divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Bounty, it's only a fallen and ſinning Creature, that is the proper Object of God's Mercy. Grace, <hi>is Mercy or Goodneſs freely diſpens'd,</hi> and therefore it conſiders its Object, not only as Miſerable, but Unworthy! Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Long-ſuffering conſiſts in the Suſpenſion of merited Vengeance, and the Communication of immerited Benefits! Thus you may ſee that all theſe Attributes of the Deity, import the Communication of ſome Good to the Creature, and are only diſtinguiſh'd in Relation to the Objects upon which they are exercis'd! Miſery is the Foil of Mercy, it can have no other Object; hence it is ſaid <hi>Jud.</hi> x. 16. That <hi>his Soul was griev'd for the Miſery of</hi> Iſrael! Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly the Vertue of Mercy was in God from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but there was no Room or Occaſion for its Diſplays, till the Creatures fatal Fall from God and Miſery conſequent upon it, provided it an Object to be exercis'd upon. Man by Sin robb'd himſelf of his Beauty and Happineſs, and expos'd himſelf to all the manifold Miſeries of this and the next Life. All which are included in the Sentence of Death annex'd to the Breach of the firſt Covenant. As Man by Sin had loſt all Right to Happineſs, and on the contrary, rendered himſelf lyable to all the Threats of the divine Law;
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:005500_0319_1039669D06810618"/>
ſo by this he likewiſe became <hi>altogether unprofitable,</hi> (Rom. iii. 12.) having loſt all his original Power to glorify God by active Obedience, and thus he had no ground from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to expect the divine favour.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. Seeing the Miſery of fallen Mankind is Two-fold, <hi>viz.</hi> Of Sin and Puniſhment, conſequently the Operations of Mercy conſiſt in affording ſuitable Succours under theſe Maladies. In reſpect of Sin the Mercy of God ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours in the following Inſtances.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. In <hi>reconciling Sinners to himſelf, by the Blood of his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten Son</hi> 2 Cor. v. 18. <hi>For the Purchaſe of which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, the eternal Father gave his beloved Son to Shame Pain and Death.</hi> John iii. 16. And for the Application there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he confers Faith upon the Elect, whereby they are ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to accept of and rely upon the bleſſed JESUS as Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator and Reconciler. And</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. By renewing Sinners by his Spirit, hereby the Tyranny and Dominion of Sin is broken, and the People of God enabled to overcome Sin, and triumph over it. <hi>Rom.</hi> vi. 12. <hi>Let not Sin reign in your Mortal Bodies, that ye ſhould obey it in the Luſts thereof.</hi> Rom. vii. 25. <hi>I thank God thro' JESUS CHRIST our Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In reſpect of Puniſhment, divine Mercy Succours in the following Manner.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. By bearing with the Sinner for a Time before Judgment is inflicted. <hi>Rom.</hi> ix. 22. <hi>What if God willing to ſhew his Wrath, and to make his Power known, endur'd with much long ſuffering, the Veſſels of Wrath fitted to Deſtruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly. By threatning Puniſhments againſt the Impenitent, in order to reclaim them from their Treſpaſſes. God warns before he wounds, and ſends his Servants to ſlay Sinners by his Word, before he ſlays them by his Sword.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="317" facs="unknown:005500_0320_1039669B82CCACC0"/>3dly. By pointing to a Remedy, whereby the impend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Stroke of divine Judgment may be averted. <hi>Jer.</hi> xviii. 7, 8. <hi>At what Inſtant I ſhall ſpeak concerning a Nation, and concerning a Kingdom to pluck up, and to pull down, and to deſtroy it, if that Nation againſt whom I have pronounced turn from their Evil, I will repent of the Evil I thought to do unto them.</hi> If Sinners repent of the Evil of Sin, God will avert the Evil of Judgment.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. By inviting of, and expoſtulating with Sinners to accept of the Remedy propos'd. <hi>Iſa.</hi> i. 18. <hi>Come now and let us reaſon together, tho' your Sins be as Scarlet, they ſhall be as white as Snow, tho' they be red like Crimſon, they ſhall be as Wool.</hi> Jer. ii. 5. <hi>Thus ſayeth the Lord, what Iniquity have your Fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after Vanity and become vain?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5thly. By receiving into Favour thoſe that comply with the Remedy, how great ſoever their Treſpaſſes have been, by forgiving their Sins, ſanctifying and ſweetening their Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and ſupporting them under them by his Spirit, Love, Power. <hi>Pſal.</hi> ciii. 3. <hi>Who forgiveth all thine Iniquities, who healeth all thy Diſeaſes.</hi> 2 Cor. xii. 9. <hi>And he ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, my Grace is ſufficient for thee.</hi> 2 Cor. i. 3, 4. <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be God even the Father of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, the Father of Mercies and the God of all Comfort, who comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us in all our Tribulation.</hi> And</p>
            <p n="6">6thly. Such as do not accept of the Remedy offered, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Almighty has ſuſpended the Execution of Juſtice, until there be no Remedy. When he begins to inflict de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Judgment (in General,) he doth it by Degrees, firſt he ſends lighter Calamities, and when thoſe do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the Sinner, he ſends heavier. In the Day of God's rough Wind, He ſtays his Eaſt Wind. Firſt Rods are try'd, and if thoſe do not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Johovah does not all at once, ſtir <hi>up all his Wrath. Pſal.</hi> lxxviii. 38. But the</p>
            <p n="2">2d. Propos'd was to ſpeak <hi>of the Kinds of Mercy.</hi> Now the Mercy of God, may be ſaid to be Two-fold, <hi>viz.</hi> Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>common</hi> or <hi>ſpecial. Common Mercy</hi> conſiſts in confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring without Diſtinction, upon the Children of Men, the Outward Comforts and Conveniencies of Life, and hence the Almighty is ſaid to <hi>cauſe his Sun to riſe upon the Evil and the Good, and to ſend his rain upon the Juſt and the Unjuſt.</hi> Mat. v. 45. But the <hi>ſpecial Mercy</hi> of God, conſiſts in conferring upon the Elect, ſuch Things as do accompany Salvation, and that thro' Chriſt, in the Channel of the New Covenant, <hi>Eph.</hi> i. 3. <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, who hath bleſſed us with all ſpiritual Bleſſings, in Heavenly Places in CHRIST.</hi> But I proceed to the</p>
            <p n="3">3d. <hi>Propos'd,</hi> which was to diſcourſe upon <hi>the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of divine Mercy.</hi> And</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. It is <hi>eternal, Pſal.</hi> ciii. 17. <hi>The Mercy of God is from everlaſting to everlaſting.</hi> It is repeated Twenty-ſix Times in one Pſalm, <hi>that his Mercy endureth forever.</hi> Pſal. cxxxvi. And this may juſtly enhanſe our Eſteem of it, and deſire after it. Tho' God may hide <hi>his Face for a little Moment,</hi> yet with <hi>everlaſting loving Kindneſs</hi> will he return to his People. And</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. God's <hi>Mercy is great,</hi> and hence God is ſaid <hi>to be plentious in Mercy,</hi> Pſal. lxxxvi. 5. <hi>Rich in Mercy,</hi> Eph. ii. 4. And in <hi>Pſal.</hi> li. 1. We read of the Multitude <hi>of his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Mercies.</hi> And in (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> xxiv. 14.) his Mercies are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſaid <hi>to be great.</hi> But methinks the greatneſs of God's Mercy appears eſpecially, by conſidering theſe two Things, <hi>viz.</hi> What is the Sinners <hi>Due</hi> according to ſtrict Juſtice, and the <hi>Mitigation</hi> thereof, which he enjoys in this World.
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:005500_0322_10396697E5F72590"/>
Surely <hi>the Wages of Sin is Death.</hi> Rom. vi. 23. which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all the Miſeries of this preſent Life, as well as the Pains of Hell hereafter. Now, therefore every Mitigation of thoſe Miſeries, every Comfort the Sinner enjoys is Mercy, it is what the Sinner has forfeited a Right to, it is what he deſerves not.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. The Mercy of God is <hi>incomparable,</hi> Jer. iii. 1. <hi>They ſay if a Man put away his Wife, and ſhe go from him, and become another Man's, ſhall he return unto her again?— But thou haſt played the Harlot with many Lovers, yet return unto me ſaith the Lord!</hi> The Merciful God exceeds his Creatures both in giving and forgiving. And</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. In giving: Our Donations are often extorted from us, but he gives of his own accord, without any incentive, but what is in his own Boſom. (<hi>Iſa.</hi> lxv. 1.)</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. We give but ſmall Gifts, but he gives the greateſt, viz. <hi>Himſelf,</hi> his <hi>Son,</hi> his <hi>Spirit,</hi> his <hi>Kingdom. Joh.</hi> iii. 16.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. We give to our Friends, but Jehovah confers ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Donations on his Enemies. (<hi>Mat.</hi> v. 45.)</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. We are ſoon weary of giving, but ſo is not God, he is unwearied in his Mercy (to the Penitent) <hi>he giveth li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally and upraideth not,</hi> Jam. i. 5. And</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. The Merciful God exceeds his Creatures, in forgiving.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Men are revengful to thoſe that wrong them, but God is <hi>merciful and gracious, long ſuffering,</hi> as our Text aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts. How remarkable to this Purpoſe are theſe Words of the Prophet <hi>Hoſ.</hi> xi. 9. <hi>I will not execute the Fierceneſs of mine Anger, I will not return to deſtroy</hi> Ephraim, <hi>for I am God and not Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly. Men are difficultly drawn to forgive, and cannot forgive often, <hi>God but is ready to pardon</hi> Neh. ix.17. <hi>And do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s multiply Pardons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="320" facs="unknown:005500_0323_10396696637024C0"/>3dly. Sometimes Men forgive when it is not in their Power to revenge themſelves, but Sinners are always under God's Controle, and within the reach of his Arm. But</p>
            <p n="4">4th. The Mercy of God is <hi>ſure,</hi> and infallible, <hi>Iſa.</hi> lv. 3. <hi>Incline your Ear, and come unto me, hear and your Soul ſhall live; and I will make an everlaſting Covenant with you, even the ſure Mercies of</hi> David. And hence it is, <hi>that the Gifts and Calling of God are</hi> ſaid to be <hi>without Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and that the Foundation of God ſtands ſure. The Lord knoweth who are his.</hi> God's ſpecial Mercy to his People is built upon the ſure and invariable Foundation of his Purpoſes and Promiſes, as well as the Satisfaction and Interceſſion of CHRIST. And</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. God's Mercy is <hi>free Epheſ.</hi> i. 11. <hi>In whom al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo we have obtained an Inheritance, being predeſtinated ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Purpoſe of him, who worketh all Things after the Counſel of his own Will.</hi> Albeit the Vertue of Mercy belongs to God, in reſpect of his Being, yet the Diſpenſation of it depends entirely upon God's good Pleaſure, and hence the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> informs us, <hi>That it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth Mercy</hi> and that <hi>he hath Mercy upon whom he will have Mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth,</hi> Rom. ix.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe when ſuch Things as are really or ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly contrary, are put together, they illuſtrate each other. It may not be improper before I proceed to the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Subject to diſcourſe upon the Severity of God in his Judgments, which is ſeemingly oppos'd to his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Of this mention is made <hi>Rom.</hi> xi. 22. and in many other Places of Scripture; and of this there be many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples upon ſacred Record, ſuch as the Inſtances of the fallen Angels, our firſt Parents, the old World, <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> the Egyptians, <hi>Korah, Dathan, Abiram, Achan, Ananias,</hi>
               <pb n="321" facs="unknown:005500_0324_10396694E1970F60"/>
and <hi>Saphira,</hi> and many others. From which we may gather, that God's Judgments which he exerciſes by his Severity, are no other than ſingular Puniſhments inflicted for ſingular Offences. The meritorious Cauſe of them, is ſome agravated Iniquity, the Nature of which, is often pointed out by the Puniſhment inflicted, which is not common but ſingular. <hi>Adonibezeck,</hi> who had cut off the Thumbs and Great-Toes of Threeſcore and Ten Kings, was ſerved ſo himſelf. (<hi>Judges</hi> i. 6, 7.) And hence <hi>Samuel</hi> ſayeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Agag, That as his Sword made Women Childleſs, ſo his Mother ſhould be Childleſs among Women.</hi> 1 Sam. xv. 33. Hence the Lord elſewhere threatens, <hi>that thoſe who ſhed the Blood of others, ſhould themſelves have Blood to drink.</hi> Thus you ſee that the Puniſhment does often reſemble the Sin that procur'd it. Now the Judgments of God, are of various Kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> Spiritual or Bodily, Private or Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. <hi>Spiritual Judgments</hi> are ſuch as theſe, <hi>viz. A Famine of the Word,</hi> Amos viii. 11, 12. <hi>Leaneſs of Soul and Back-ſlidings.</hi> Rev. ii. 5. <hi>Errors in Judgment.</hi> 2 Theſ. ii. 10, 11. <hi>And for this Cauſe, God ſhall ſend them ſtrong Deluſion, that they ſhould believe a Lie.</hi> Corporal Judgments are War, Peſtilence, Famine, Drowth &amp; the like. Now the procuring Cauſes of publick and epidemical Judgments, are ſuch as theſe following, <hi>viz. Ingratitude againſt God,</hi> Iſa. i. 3. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of his Word,</hi> Iſa. xlii. 24. <hi>Who gave</hi> Jacob <hi>for a Spoil, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>to the Robbers, did not the Lord, he aganſt whom we have ſinned,: For they would not walk in his Ways, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were they obedient unto his Law.</hi> Another Cauſe of Judgments, is <hi>ſlighting</hi> of <hi>the Miniſters</hi> of God. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxxvi. 16. <hi>But they mocked the Meſſengers of God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpis'd his Word, and miſus'd his Prophets, until the Wrath of the Lord aroſe againſt his People, til there was no Remedy.</hi> Beſides <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi> are procuring Cauſes, of divine
<pb n="322" facs="unknown:005500_0325_10396692F9244FA8"/>
Judgments. <hi>Iſa.</hi> ii. 11. <hi>The lofty Looks of Man ſhall be humbled, and the Haughtineſs of Men ſhall be bro't down</hi> Jer. ii. 13, 14. Likewiſe the following Evils againſt our Neighbour, are Cauſes of divine Judgments. <hi>viz Oppreſſion</hi> of the <hi>Poor</hi> Iſa. iii. 14. <hi>The Lord will enter into Judgment with the Antients of his People, and the Princes thereof: For ye have eaten up the Vineyard, the Spoil of the Poor is in your Houſes</hi> 2dly. <hi>Wronging</hi> the <hi>Widow</hi> and <hi>Fatherleſs</hi> Iſa. i. 23. <hi>They judge not the Fatherleſs, neither does the Cauſe of the Widow come before them.</hi> 3dly. <hi>Cheating</hi> the <hi>Labourer</hi> of his Hire. Jer. xxii. 13. <hi>Woe unto him that buildeth his Houſe by Unrighteouſneſs, and his Chambers by Wrong, that uſeth his Neighbours Service without Wages, and giveth him not for his Work.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> mentions a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Cauſes together in the Fourth Chap. of his Book, 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. verſes. <hi>Hear the Word of the Lord ye Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>for the Lord has a Controverſy with the Inhabitants of the Land, becauſe there is no Truth, nor Mercy, nor Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God in the Land. By ſwearing and lying, and kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſtealing, and commiting Adultery, they break out, and Blood toucheth Blood therefore ſhall the Land mourn.</hi> To the aforeſaid Cauſes of divine Judgments I may add, <hi>Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>Hypocriſy.</hi> Iſa. v. 8, 13. <hi>Woe unto them that joyn Houſe to Houſe.—Therefore my People are gone into Captivity.</hi> Iſa. x. 6. <hi>O</hi> Aſſyrian, <hi>the Rod of mine Anger—I will ſend him againſt a Hypocritical Nation.</hi> Here it may be obſerv'd, that Judgments are not always ſent, except the aforeſaid E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils become general, and are attended with Impudence, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter various Warnings (<hi>Jer.</hi> v. 1. <hi>Iſa.</hi> iii. 9. <hi>Pſ.</hi> xcv. 10.11.) Now the Judgements of God are always juſt, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times unſearchable and wonderful: For ſometimes he not only ſends them on the Ungodly, but upon his own Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Yea as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> obſerves. <hi>Judgment begins
<pb n="323" facs="unknown:005500_0326_103966911A3F4CA0"/>
at the Houſe of God.</hi> The Lord threatned his People of old; <hi>that them only he had known of all the Families of the Earth, and therefore he would puniſh them for their Iniquities.</hi> Hence <hi>David</hi> tells us, <hi>that his Fleſh trembled for fear of God,</hi> and <hi>that he was afraid of God's Judgments.</hi> I may add, that the End of God's Judgments, is the glory of God's Holineſs, the Converſion and Humiliation of ſome, and the harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of others.

            <p n="1">1ſt. We ſhould be cautious of abuſing God's Mercy, let us beware that we ſuck not Poiſon out of that ſweet Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. To take encouragement to go on in Sin, becauſe of God's Mercy, is the vileſt Inſtance of Ingratitude, and juſtly expopoſes to an agravated Condemnation, abus'd Mercy turns into enrag'd Fury and Vengeance, <hi>Deut.</hi> xxix. 19. <hi>If he bleſs himſelf ſaying, I ſhall have Peace, tho' I walk after the Imagination of my Heart, to add Drunkeneſs to Thirſt.

            <p n="2">2dly. The Mercy of God offers Encouragement and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to the People of God in all their Diſtreſſes, whether outward or inward! Are they afflicted with outward Straits? The Merciful God who is their Shepherd, will not ſuffer them to want, but <hi>make their Bread and Waters ſure!</hi> He that hears and feeds the Ravens, will ſurely hear and help his Children! Have they backſliden from God, and are they labouring to be ſorrowfully ſenſible hereof? Then may they encourage themſelves in this, that <hi>all God's Ways are Mercy and Truth,</hi> and that the Mercy of Jehovah <hi>endureth forever!</hi> He will begin and end with Mercy, and ſuch as are under the firſt Convictions of Sin, may take Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

from the Mercy of God, which is great above the Heavens, and moſt freely diſpenſed upon the vileſt Creatures! Mercy conſiders not what one deſerves, but what he needs! God is more inclin'd to Mercy than Wrath; <hi>Juſtice and Judgment is his ſtrange Work, but Mercy is his Delight.</hi> Mic. vii. 18. <q>It's delightful to the Mother, <hi>ſayeth</hi> Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome, to have her Breaſts drawn; ſo it is to God, to have the Breaſts of his Mercy drawn.</q> 
               <hi>The Almighty is ſlow to Anger, but ready to forgive,</hi> Pſal. lxxxvi. 5. Let us therefore entertain honourable Thoughts of God's Mercy, and <hi>truſt in it forever,</hi> (Pſal. lii. 8.) What greater En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement can there be to believe, than the Mercy of God. Mercy is one of the moſt orient Pearls of the Crown of God; he reckons it his <hi>Glory</hi> to be conferring Pardons upon penitent Tranſgreſſors! And therefore he invites poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to come and lay hold on his Mercy, Rev. xxii. 17. <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever will, let him come and take of the Water of Life free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly!</hi> Mercy woo's Sinners in the moſt importunate moving and condeſcending Strains. Iſa. lv. 1. <hi>Ho every one that thirſteth, come ye to the Waters, and he that hath no Money come ye, buy and eat; come, buy Wine and Milk, without Money and without Price!</hi> And what Joy does the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty expreſs when Sinners accept of the Propoſals of his Mercy, when the Prodigal Son return'd from his Wandrings how much did it pleaſe the indulgent Father, who made a Feaſt to expreſs his Joy on that Occaſion?</p>
            <p>We ſhould be induced to enquire into the State of our Souls, in order to know whether we have an <hi>Intereſt</hi> in the ſpecial Mercy of God or not!

            <p>I return to conſider the firſt <hi>propos'd,</hi> which was to <hi>explain the Nature of the Grace of God.</hi> Now the Word <hi>Grace</hi> ſignifies ſomething that is free, as was obſerv'd in the preceeding Sermon, and it is taken two Ways, eithe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> for an <hi>Attribute</hi> of God, which is in God, or for the <hi>Gif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> of God, which is from God. In the firſt Senſe the Grace of God ſignifies his free and ſovereign Benevolence, by which he peculiarly favours and doth Good to his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whence God is call'd <hi>Gracious</hi> as in our Text, <hi>i. e.</hi> Endow'd with Grace. As from his Goodneſs he is call'd <hi>Good,</hi> and from his Juſtice <hi>Juſt.</hi> The Gifts of God, which are the Effects of the Grace that is in him, are metoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micaly call'd Grace, eſpecially ſuch of them as are Peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar and Special, <hi>i. e.</hi> Such as are confer'd upon ſome, rather than others. Hence ſome Divines obſerve, that the Word <hi>Grace</hi> intends either 1ſt. The Grace freely <hi>Giving,</hi> (Matt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> xi. 26.) Which they term <hi>(Gratiam gratis dantem,)</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the free Favour of God, or the Grace freely <hi>given,</hi> (which they call <hi>Gratiam gratis datam.</hi>) And this imports any Kind of Benefit which the Almighty confers upon his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whether Good or Bad, which makes them not in the leaſt the more acceptable to God. Or thirdly the Grace which makes acceptable, (which they term <hi>Gratiam gratu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  </gap> undeſerved Kindneſses upon his Creatures freely, and in a ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Way.</hi> The Diſpenſations of Grace have no Depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon any Dignity, or Merit of Creatures upon whom Benefits are confer'd. (<hi>Rom.</hi> xi 6.) But the whole Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="329" facs="unknown:005500_0332_103966875E1F4208"/>
thereof is the good Pleaſure of God's Will, (<hi>Mat.</hi> xi. 26.) which reſpects all Creatures, even to the nobleſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. Whatever any of theſe enjoy, they have it of Grace, for who among all created Beings, has firſt given to God, <hi>and it ſhall be reompenſed to him again</hi> Rom. xi. 35. In the mean Time, theſe Things are more properly and peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſcrib'd to Grace, which are different from Nature. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Grace ſhould not be confounded; ſuch Things as by the kind Conſtitution of God, belong to every Creature according to their different kinds, are not uſually call'd Grace, becauſe, tho' they be undue, yet they belong to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But to make this more plain, let us conſider the</p>
            <p n="2">2d. <hi>Propos'd,</hi> which was to ſpeak of the <hi>Kinds</hi> of <hi>Grace;</hi> and here it may be obſerv'd, that Grace is Three-fold, <hi>viz. Univerſal, common,</hi> and <hi>ſaving.</hi> And</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. <hi>Univerſal Grace is that, whereby Jehovah diſpenſes natural Things upon all his Creatures,</hi> and hence he is call'd <hi>the Saviour of all Men.</hi> 1 Tim. iv. 10. And is ſaid to <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Man and Beaſt.</hi> Pſa. xxxvi. 6. He cauſes his Sun to <hi>riſe upon the Fields of the Evil and the Good, and ſends his Rain upon the Juſt and Unjuſt:</hi> He gives to Man Life, Health, Strength, and all the Supports he enjoys therein, all which being undeſerv'd, may be call'd Grace; but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Uſage of Scripture and Antiquity, they ſeldom and leſs properly bear that Name.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. <hi>Common Grace conſiſts in the Communication of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good Things upon Men promiſcuouſly, whether they be good or bad, elect or not elect, ſuch as natural Wiſdom and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and all the Train of moral Vertues,</hi> in which even ſome Pagans have excell'd. And to theſe we may add, all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward religious Priviledges and Means of Grace; together with thoſe tranſient Effects which are ſometimes produced, by them upon the Unregenerate, ſuch as ſome kind of Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
<pb n="330" facs="unknown:005500_0333_10396685DBE18AF0"/>
and Stirrings of religious Affection. In a Word all thoſe common Operations of the Holy Spirit, which are not follow'd by a habitual and ſaving Change, muſt be aſcrib'd hereto. Of theſe mention is made <hi>Heb.</hi> vi. 4. 5, 6. and alſo in the Parable of the Sower, <hi>Mat.</hi> xiii. 20, 21. <hi>But he that received the Seed into Stony Places, the ſame is he that heareth the Word, and anon with Joy receiveth it, yet hath he not Root in himſelf, but dureth for a while, for when Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation or Perſecution ariſeth, becauſe of the Word, by and by he is offended.</hi> But</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. <hi>Saving Grace is that undue or undeſerved Lve of God, whereby he confers upon the Elect only, ſaving Benefits, of his own meer good Pleaſure.</hi> Here obſerve</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. That it is <hi>Love,</hi> or the kind Inclination or Propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of God's Will to communicate good to his Elect.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. It is <hi>undue, undeſerved Love.</hi> The Objects of this Love, conſider'd as Creatures, can merit no Good at the Hand of God, ſeeing they have receiv'd their All from him, ſurely they cannot put the Almighty in their Debt, by giving him what is his own; and conſider'd as Sinners, who by their voluntary Tranſgreſſion, have fallen ſhort of his Glory, they deſerve his high and dreadful Diſpeaſure.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. It is <hi>diſtinguiſhing Love,</hi> manifeſted to the Elect in a ſovereign Way, <hi>according to the good Pleaſure of God's Will.</hi> Epheſ. i. 9. That is given to one which is denied to another, and only becauſe it is God's Pleaſure. Hence is that Querry of one of CHRIST'S Diſciples. <hi>John</hi> xiv. 22. <hi>Lord how is that thou wilt manifeſt thy ſelf to us, and not to the World</hi> And does not our Lord himſelf, thank his eternal Father for the Diſplays of his Sovereignty in this Reſpect, <hi>Mat.</hi> xi. 25, 26. <hi>I thank thee O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, becauſe thou haſt hid theſe Things from the Wiſe and Prudent, and revealed them unto Babes, even ſo
<pb n="331" facs="unknown:005500_0334_10396683C86F5510"/>
Father, for ſo it ſeemed good in thy Sight.</hi> It is but a few, a Remnant of the fallen Race of Mankind, upon whom God is pleaſed to vouchſafe, and in whom he is pleaſed to glorify, his ſpecial Grace <hi>Luke</hi> xiii. 24. <hi>Rom.</hi> ix. 2, 7. Eſaias <hi>cryeth alſo concerning</hi> Iſrael, <hi>tho' the Number of the Children of</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, <hi>be as the Sand of the Sea, a Remnant ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4thly. It is <hi>efficacious Love,</hi> which confers ſaving Benefits, hence it is call'd <hi>the Grace of God, which bringeth Salvation. Tit.</hi> ii. 11. And the Bleſſings it vouchſafes, are term'd Things that <hi>accompany Salvation Heb.</hi> vi. 9. And hence the Pſalmiſt prays, <hi>Pſ.</hi> cvi. 4. <hi>Remember me O Lord, with the Favour that thou beareſt unto thy People. O viſit me with thy Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! that I may ſee the Good of thy Choſen, that I may rejoyce in the Gladneſs of thy Nation, that I may glory with thine Inheritance.</hi> And here it may be neceſſary to obſerve par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly that divine Love confers freely upon the Elect, or Concerts, for them the following important Benefits, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. <hi>Election, this is free</hi> and <hi>gracious,</hi> without Faith or Works foreſeen <hi>Rom.</hi> xi. 5. <hi>Even ſo then, at this preſent Time alſo, there is a Remnant according to the Election of Grace.</hi> Epheſ. i. 5. <hi>Having predeſtinated us, unto the Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Children, by</hi> JESUS CHRIST <hi>to himſelf according to the good Pleaſure of his Will. If it be by Grace it is no more of Works, otherwiſe Grace would be no more Grace, and Works would be no more Works.</hi> Rom. xi. 6. To the ſame Effect the Apoſtle elſewhere obſerves <hi>That it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth Mercy,</hi> Rom. ix. 16. It is inconſiſtent with the Independency and Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability of God, to ſuppoſe that any Thing without him, ſhould alter or incline his Will.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. <hi>Redemption</hi> is likewiſe of <hi>Free Grace.</hi> The contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of this Scheme of Happineſs, as well as the ſending of the bleſſed Son of God to effect it, by his Obedience and
<pb n="332" facs="unknown:005500_0335_10396681C776B888"/>
and Sufferings were marvellous Diſplays of the Fathers pure Affection to a miſerable World! 1 <hi>John</hi> vi. 10. <hi>Herein is Love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and ſent his Son to be the Propitiation for our Sins.</hi> And to what elſe than <hi>Free Grace,</hi> can we aſcribe God the Father's Acceptance, of the Suretyſhip of CHRIST in the Sinners Room and Place? Strict Juſtice certainly demands perſonal Satisfaction; and does not the Love of CHRIST paſs Knowledge, in that he who is over all God bleſſed for ever came into a State of the loweſt Abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, voluntarily to ſave worthleſs Duſt from perpetual Ruin? How ſweetly does the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak to this Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> viii. 9. <hi>For ye know the Grace of our Lord JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST that tho' he was Rich, yet for your Sakes he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Poor, that ye thro' his Poverty might be Rich.</hi> Beſides it may be here obſerv'd, that Redemption by the Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of CHRIST, is frequently in Scripture reſtrain'd to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Number, who are call'd the <hi>People</hi> of God, the <hi>Sheep</hi> of CHRIST, and ſuch as were <hi>given</hi> to him by his Father <hi>Mat.</hi> i. 21. <hi>John</hi> x. 15. xvii. 9.</p>
            <p>Albeit the Blood of the Son of God be of infinite Value, and therefore the Satisfaction made by it, may in this reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect be ſaid to be univerſal; yet inaſmuch as it was neither the Deſign of the Father, nor the Son, that it ſhould be ſpent for all, ſo as to be ſaved by it. It is therefore to be referred to ſingular Grace. Moreover</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. The <hi>Application</hi> of <hi>Redemption</hi> in all it's Branches, is of <hi>Free Grace,</hi> as may appear by the following In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Particulars, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="333" facs="unknown:005500_0336_103966804499A490"/>3dly. <hi>Converſion is not of Fleſh, or Blood nor of the Will of Man but of God.</hi> None of theſe Graces which I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, are the Fruits of Free Will: <hi>For we are not ſufficient to think any Thing as of ourſelves, but our ſufficiency is of God.</hi> 2 Cor. iii. 5. <hi>No they are all the Fruits of the Spirit.</hi> Gal. v. 22. Who produces them not by moral Swaſion like poor Creatures, but by an Almighty creating Power, taking away <hi>the Stony Heart, and giving a Heart of Fleſh.</hi> (1 Cor. iii. 5, 6. Pſ. li. 10. Ezek. xxxvi. 26, 27.) And</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. <hi>Juſtification,</hi> whereby an elect Sinner is freed from the Guilt of Sin, and hath a Right to eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is of <hi>free Grace.</hi> Rom. iii. 24. <hi>Being juſtified freely by his Grace, thro' the Redemption that is in</hi> CHRIST JESUS.

            <p n="5">5thly. Our <hi>Adoption</hi> or <hi>Right</hi> to the important Priviledges of Children, and joint Heirſhip with CHRIST is alſo of <hi>pure Grace, Epheſ.</hi> i. 4, 6, <hi>Having predeſtinated us unto the Adoption of Children by</hi> JESUS CHRIST <hi>to himſelf, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the good Pleaſure of his Will, to the Praiſe of the Glory of his Grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6thly. Our <hi>Salvation,</hi> in regard of the Right thereto, is of <hi>Grace.</hi> And hence eternal Life is ſaid to be the <hi>Gift of God, thro'</hi> JESUS CHRIST <hi>our Lord, Rom.</hi> vi. 23. And elſewhere we are ſaid expreſly to be <hi>ſav'd by Grace, Epheſ.</hi> ii. 8. In the mean Time it ſhould be remembred, that good Works are the Way to the Kingdom, tho' they be not the Cauſe of our reigning, as <hi>Barnard</hi> of old obſerv'd. Tho' our Right to Happineſs is of Grace, as was before obſerv'd, yet the Almighty hath by his gracious Conſtitution, ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:005500_0337_1039667EC0688DA0"/>
the Matter, that good Works are neceſſary to the Poſſeſſion of it. (<hi>Mat.</hi> xxv. 21, 34, 35.) I proceed to the</p>
            <p n="3">3d. Propos'd, which was to mention ſome Conſiderations ſerving to manifeſt the <hi>Sovereignty</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of God's Grace. And 1ſt. Methinks the Glory of divine Grace appears by conſidering the <hi>Author</hi> of it, who is a Being infinitely and invariable Happy in himſelf, as well as eſſentially and eternally Glorious: And ſo neither needs the Services of Creatures, nor can be benefited by them. Our Goodneſs extends not to him, neither is it any Gain to the Almighty that we are Righteous. To acknowledge God's Glory, adds no more to its Luſtre than ſpeaking well of the natural Sun adds to its Beauty.</p>
            <p>It may be here alſo obſerv'd, that <hi>Jehovah</hi> would have had Millions of Angels to celebrate his Praiſe and execute his Pleaſure, altho' he had made his Juſtice triumph in the Ruin of the whole human Race; which certainly he might have done. Or he could have form'd innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Creatures of a more noble Order, than any of the Creation to celebrate the Glory of his Attributes, if it had ſo pleas'd his Majeſty: For he is Almighty in Power, hath the reſidue of the Spirit, and can raiſe up Children even out of the Stones to <hi>Abram.</hi> But</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. Let us conſider the <hi>Object</hi> upon which this divine Grace is conferr'd, and we ſhall find</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. That it is <hi>Man,</hi> not Angels. Our Saviour took not on him the Nature of Angels, but the Seed of <hi>Abram;</hi> becauſe he deſign'd to ſave the one, and to reſerve thoſe that fell of the other, in Chains under Darkneſs, unto the Judgment of the great Day. What is Man but Duſt and Aſhes? A Worm that is cruſh'd before the Moth, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unworthy of the kind Notice of the great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="335" facs="unknown:005500_0338_1039667CE98EE2B0"/>
God! How amazing is the diſtinguiſhing Grace of God in paſſing by Creatures of a higher Order, and fixing his Love upon Man?</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. It is <hi>Sinners,</hi> upon whom divine Grace is confer'd. Man by Creation was but Duſt, but by Sin he is become polluted Duſt, and ſo Odious and Loathſome, as well as Wretched and Miſerable! And this doleful State he has wilfully brought himſelf into, and wilfully continues in againſt all the Remonſtrances of Conſcience, againſt all the kind Importunities of a condeſcending God and Saviour! Man by Sin has brought this twofold Miſery upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, 1ſt. That he deſerves no Good. And 2dly. That he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves all Evil! How can theſe deſerve Good at the Hand of God, whoſe Perſons and Performances are cover'd with Deformity and Pollution? Indeed we deſerve not the leaſt common Mercy, how much leſs then can we merit ſpecial Benefits? <hi>Gen.</hi> xxxii. 10. <hi>I am not worthy of the leaſt of all the Mercies, and of all the Truth which thou haſt ſhew'd unto thy Servant!</hi> Men in a State of Nature are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable Creatures, they are neither prepar'd to receive Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, nor able to prepare themſelves, ſeeing they are dead in Sins and Treſpaſſes. And by their multiply'd Impieties they deſerve the divine Diſpleaſure, and provoke him to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict it. As they are Children of Wrath by Nature, ſo they weary the Almighty by continued Iniquities in Practice, (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> ii. 3. <hi>Iſa.</hi> xliii. 24.) And</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. The Perſons to whom divine Grace is given, are Enemies to God, both in their Minds and Lives, Rom. viii. 7. <hi>The Carnal Mind is Enmity againſt God, for it is not Subject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be!</hi> Now Enmity imports a high Degree of ſixed and implacable Spite, O dreadful State! This inward Enmity, unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Sinners bewray by their Rebellion againſt God, in
<pb n="336" facs="unknown:005500_0339_1039667B0C333EC8"/>
Practice and cruel Confederacies with his declared Enemies Col. i. 21. <hi>And you that were ſometime allienated, and Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in your Mind by wicked Works, yet now hath he recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4thly. It is generally the poorer and meaner Sort of Men, that are favour'd with divine Grace, while the Rich, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, and Great are paſſed by. Many who make a conſiderable Figure in the World by the Keeneſs of their natural and acquired Endowments, and by the Splendor of their outward Circumſtances, who are entirely deſtitute of ſpecial Grace, while others who are Poor and deſpis'd are favour'd therewith! This Subject the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes largely upon, 1 Cor. i. 26,—28. <hi>Not many Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not many Noble are call'd, but God hath choſen the fooliſh Things of the World, to confound the Wiſe, and the Weak Things of the World, to confound the Things that are Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and baſe Things of the World, and Things which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d, hath God choſen; yea Things that are not, to bring to nought Things that are.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5thly. Many of thoſe to whom divine Grace is given, were before Converſion notorious Sinners, ſome Blaſphemers, Perſecutors, and Injurious: Theſe Things the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> aſcribes to himſelf, he ſhut up many of the Saints in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, conſented to their Death, Puniſh'd them in every Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue, compell'd them to Blaſpheme, and being exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mad againſt them, he perſecuted them to ſtrange Cities (<hi>Act.</hi> xxvi. 10.11. 1 Tim. i. 13, 15.) Some, before Converſion, have been Idolaters, as the <hi>Epheſians.</hi> Some <hi>Fornicators, Adulterers, Effeminate, Abuſers, of themſelves with Mankind, Thieves, Covetous, Drunkards, Revilers, Extortioners,</hi> ſuch were ſome of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and yet they were <hi>waſh'd, ſanctifi'd</hi> and <hi>juſtifi'd</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. 9.11. O rich and glorious Grace! How admirable is the Grace
<pb n="337" facs="unknown:005500_0340_1039667987F819A0"/>
of God, in the Inſtance of <hi>Manaſſeh</hi>'s Converſion? Who tho' a Conjurer a Murderer, and one who deſpis'd God, and bid defiance to Heaven in Proſperity, yet when in Adverſity he humbled himſelf and made Supplication to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah, was graciouſly heard and accepted. (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxxiii. 9, 12, 13.) I ſhall only add the famous Inſtance of <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> who was a notorious Sinner. This poor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man loved much, becauſe much was forgiven her; her Heart was ſo melted with a Senſe of divine Goodneſs, that ſhe could waſh our Lords Feet with her Tears! (<hi>Luke</hi> vii.)</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. The Glory of divine Grace appears not only from it's <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Object,</hi> but alſo from the <hi>Seaſon</hi> in which it is vouchſaf'd. The Almighty beſtows Benefits upon his People, at ſuch Seaſons, when they are moſt ſuitable. <hi>In the Mount of Difficulty and Diſtreſs, the Lord is ſeen, yea he is a very preſent Help in Trouble.</hi> When Sinners have wearied themſelves in the greatneſs of their Way, and thro' a Series of Diſappointments are brought to the laſt Extremity, the bleſſed God manifeſts his Grace and Mercy! And thus when gracious Perſons are encircled with manifold Miſeries, outward and inward, and their ſorrowful Hearts are ready to ſink into Deſpondency, with a long continu'd oppreſſive Weight of Woe, from which they can hardly ſee any way of Deliverance; they are deſolate and afflicted, their Hearts almoſt overwhelm'd, then Jehovah ſends Deliverance! (<hi>Pſa.</hi> xxv. 16, 17.) <hi>And they are as thoſe that dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> When the compaſſionate Jehovah returns to his People, after their ſinful Wandrings from him. O! It makes them admire the pure and glorious Riches of divine Grace! And truly the Lord teaches his People more and more of this Doctrine, namely, the freeneſs of his Grace, while they are in the World. And</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="338" facs="unknown:005500_0341_1039667803D4F500"/>4thly The freeneſs of divine Grace appears likewiſe from the <hi>Manner</hi> in which divine Benefits are confer'd <hi>e. g.</hi> we contribute nothing to the Change wrought upon us by Converſion. The natural Byaſs of our Wllls is againſt it, and this Reluctance and Oppoſition remains, until it be overcome by the Almighty Power of God, who is hence ſaid to <hi>make his People a willing People in the Day of his Power.</hi> Pſal. ciii. That Alteration of Diſpoſitions which is imply'd in Converſion, is not deſir'd by the Sinner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it; tho' unregenerate Sinners deſire to be deliver'd from Miſery, yet they do not deſire to be deliver'd from Sin the Cauſe of it! For that is as their right Eye, and right Arm! Well then ſeeing thoſe Benefits whereby the Soul is ſanctified are undeſerv'd, undeſir'd, yea oppos'd by the unconverted, ſurely then they muſt be freely vouchſaf'd. But</p>
            <p n="5">5thly, The Riches of divine Grace appear from the <hi>Nature</hi> of the Benefits confer'd; which are attended with theſe two following Properties, <hi>viz. Freedom</hi> from the greateſt <hi>Evils,</hi> and a <hi>Right to, and Poſſeſſion of,</hi> the greateſt <hi>Good.</hi> Sinners while in a State of Unregeneracy are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers'd in, and expos'd to the greateſt Evils, both moral and penal. They are under the Dominion of Sin, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ainted by it; and by Reaſon thereof they are expos'd to the Curſe and Wrath of God, in this and the next World. They are in a Dungeon of Darkneſs and Diſtreſs, in a Pit in which there is no Water! Bound and ſhackled with the heavy Curſe of God, void of Light and Beauty, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with the baſeſt Deformity! Now the Benefits of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace, bring the Sinner from this Depth of Woe, looſe his Shakles, and releaſe him out of Priſon! Hereby he is freed from the Guilt of Sin, thro' the Righteouſneſs of CHRIST imputed to him, and hereby he is freed from the Dominion of it, thro' the ſanctifying Influences of the
<pb n="339" facs="unknown:005500_0342_103966760F256160"/>
Holy Spirit; and as he is thus freed frrom the greateſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils by divine Grace, ſo he is thereby entitled to, and made a Poſſeſſor of the greateſt Good, both Phyſical and moral, being made a Partaker of the divine Love, and beautified with the Divine Image, <hi>viz.</hi> Holineſs. By the former he is refreſh'd, and by the latter adorn'd. And as he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the unerring Conduct and Almighty Protection of God here, ſo he is entitled to the perfect Enjoyment of God hereafter; which is the greateſt Good, that it is poſſible for a Creature to receive. I proceed to the</p>
            <p n="4">4th. Propos'd, which was to conſider, what is <hi>really</hi> and <hi>ſeemingly oppos'd</hi> to the Grace of God. Now the Things that are <hi>oppos'd really,</hi> are theſe two, <hi>viz, Nature</hi> and <hi>Merit.</hi> And</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. <hi>Nature. Hereby we are Children of Wrath, being dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins,</hi> Eph. ii, 1, 3. By Nature we have blind Minds, and ſtony Hearts, neither diſcern the Things that be of God, nor are willing to be ſubject thereto, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ii. 14. <hi>The natural Man underſtands not the Things of the Spirit of God, nither can he diſcern them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned,</hi> Rom. viii. 7. <hi>The carnal Mind is En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt God, it is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be.</hi> Nature in its preſent fallen and corrupted State, fights againſt the Grace of God, as long as it can. And therefore the Citadel of Man's Heart, muſt be taken by Storm, if the King of Glory takes Poſſeſſion of it. And</p>
            <p n="2">2dly The <hi>Papal Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Merits</hi> of <hi>Works,</hi> in the Buſineſs of Juſtification, directly oppoſes the Grace of God: For Grace is undue and undeſerved Love, as was ſhewn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Rom.</hi> iii. 28. <hi>We conclude that a Man is juſtified by Faith, without the Deeds of the Law. If it be of Works, it is no more of Grace, otherwiſe Works would be no more Works, and Grace would be no more Grace.</hi> But to proceed.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="340" facs="unknown:005500_0343_1039667418799830"/>3dly. The <hi>Wrath</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is <hi>ſeemingly oppos'd to Grace.</hi> Now the Wrath of God is no other, than his vindicative Juſtice, or Diſpoſition to puniſh the Guilty; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes three Things in it.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. A <hi>Purpoſe</hi> of <hi>puniſhing</hi> the <hi>Tranſgreſſor,</hi> Rom. i. 18. <hi>For the Wrath of God is revealed from Heaven, againſt all Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs and Unrighteouſneſs of Men, who hold the Truth in Unrighteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p n="3">3dly. It includes the <hi>Execution</hi> of the <hi>Threatnings,</hi> by all Kinds of Revenge and Judgments. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> v. 6. <hi>Let no Man deceive you, with vain Words, for becauſe theſe Things, cometh the Wrath of God upon the Children of Diſobedience,</hi> i. e. <hi>Fruits and Effects of Wrath in divine Judgments.</hi> Sin wrongs the Almighty by inſulting his Sovereignty and Legiſlative Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, by contradicting his unſpotted Holineſs, and by ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Riches of his Goodneſs. By Sin God is wrong'd, and rob'd of that Tribute of Honour and Service which is due to him, from all created Beings, by the ſtrongeſt claims of Right, <hi>viz.</hi> Creation, Preſervation, Proviſion. And ſome are under the additional Engagement of redeeming Love. It is Sin therefore, that ſtirs up the divine Wrath, and becauſe there be various Aggravations of Sin, therefore there are various Degrees of Wrath excited thereby, and proportion'd thereto. And hence the Scriptures ſpeaking after the manner of Men, make mention of God's hot Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, Fury, and Rage, <hi>Pſ.</hi> vi. 1. <hi>Ezek.</hi> viii. 18. <hi>Therefore will I alſo deal in Fury, mine Eye ſhall not ſpare, neither will

They ſerve therefore only to repreſent the great contrariety of the Nature of God to Sin, as well as the more dreadful Effects of his Wrath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on heinous Tranſgreſſors! But in the mean Time, it may be obſerv'd, that the Wrath of God in every Inſtance of it is terrible, and irreſiſtable; becauſe it proceeds from an infinite and Almighty God. And hence it's compar'd to a <hi>burning Fire,</hi> and to <hi>a Whirlwind, that ſweeps all before it.</hi> Zeph. i. And except Repentance intervene, it will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual and eternal.</p>
            <p>Altho' the Doctrine of <hi>Free-Grace</hi> has been abus'd into Licentiouſneſs, by ſome ſordid Spirits, which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> mentions with great Abhorrence! <hi>Rom.</hi> vi. 1, 2. <hi>Shall we continue in Sin that Grace may abound, God forbid!</hi> Yet it's Deſign and Tendency is to promote the Contrary. And indeed nothing more powerfully incites an ingenuous Mind to Holineſs, than the Conſideration of God's free and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing <hi>Grace.</hi> And here it is to be noted, that tho' Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, gives his Grace freely, that ſo no Creature <hi>ſhould have Occaſion of boaſting or glorying in his Preſence.</hi> Yet ordinarily he vouchſafes it in the Uſe of appointed Means; that ſo there may be no Umbrage for Negligence, but on the Contrary, all that excitement to Duty, which can conſiſt with the divine Sovereignty! Theſe Things are excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently repreſented in the xxxvith chap. of <hi>Ezek.</hi> from the xxvith to the xxxviith verſe there. Tho' the Almighty promiſes to confer ſaving Benefits, yet he tells them, that <hi>for all theſe Things, he will be enquired of by them.</hi> But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p n="2">2dly. We ſhould examine ourſelves whether we are Partakers of God's ſpecial Grace, in the Inſtances before mentioned, of <hi>effectual Calling,</hi> Faith, Juſtification, Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Adoption; have we by theſe Things been brought to a high prizing of CHRIST above all others, to a Child-like Familiarity with God, to a habitual holy, humble, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and loving Temper of Mind, and Courſe of Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, if ſo, let us rejoyce in CHRIST JESUS in all outward Diſtreſſes, let us ever admire the Sovereign and diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace of God; and give to God the Glory of it in Heart, Speech, and Practice.</p>
            <p>But ſuch of you as have not found the aforeſaid Experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>rejoyce not for Joy, as other People, for ye have gone a whoring from God!

            <p>Is the Grace of God free?

            <p>And methinks the Doctrine of <hi>Free Grace</hi> ſhould power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully induce us to Humility, ſeeing that it is God only, who has made us to differ from others, and that we have nothing but what we have receiv'd. We are his Debtors, for all we have in <hi>Hand</hi> or <hi>Hope.</hi> The Nature of Grace ſuppoſes the Object, upon whom it is vouchſaf'd, unworthy of it. A continued humbling Senſe of this, would as much conduce to our Benefit, as Ornament.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing the good God is pleas'd to heap many unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Kindneſſes freely upon us, why ſhould we not imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate his Grace, by conferring Benefits upon our fellow Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, without any regard to Dignity, or Hopes of a reward from them: By this we ſhould glorify God and convince others that we are his Children.</p>
            <p>In fine, let me in the Name of the gracious God my Lord and Maſter, earneſtly beſeech poor Sinners of every Order to haſten as for their Lives to that Fountain of Grace that is in CHRIST. Think not to put the Almighty in your Debt by your doings, for if Grace be not Free it is not Grace. Sinners abuſe not the Grace of God by Delays, and other Impieties, or expect his inflam'd Wrath to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge the Ingratitude! <hi>Let the wicked Man forſake his Way, and the unrighteous Man his thot's, and turn unto God and he will have Mercy on him, and to our God for he will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly Pardon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I add no more at preſent, may the Almighty and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God bleſs his Word, that has been offer'd in his Name to our ſpecial and enduring Benefit. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p n="1">1ſt. Propos'd, which was to ſpeak of the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>divine Patience.</hi> Here it may be obſerv'd, that tho' Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Long-ſuffering in Creatures differ realy, for the former ſeems only to ſignify our inability to puniſh an Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the latter our Unwillingneſs to do it, when in our

Power, but in God they are the ſame, and can be only diſtinguiſh'd, as to the Degree of Duration or Continuance. Long-ſuffering is only a Suſpenſion of Wrath for a longer Time: This being the Caſe I ſhall not therefore treat of them diſtinctly, but proc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d to obſerve, that the Patience of God may be thus deſcrib'd, viz. <hi>That it is a Branch of his Mercy whereby he long defers deſerved Wrath, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates the Executions of it in this World towards guilty Creatures.</hi> Here obſerve 1ſt. That the <hi>Object</hi> of God's <hi>Patience,</hi> is guilty Creatures. <q>An innocent Creature cannot be the Object of it, becauſe avenging Juſtice has no Demand upon him, he may be the Object of Goodneſs, but not of Long-ſuffering and Forbearance: For Puniſhment cannot be ſaid to be defer'd where it is not due.</q>
2dly The <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Patience,</hi> are 1ſt. God's defering the Execution of deſerv'd Wrath for a Time: And this proceeds neither from the Want of Power or Opportunity to puniſh Tranſgreſſors: For they are always under the Cognizance of God's Eye, and within the Reach of his Arm. He can in an Inſtant ſpeak them to nothing by a Word, or ſtrike them dead and damned at a Blow, when and where he pleaſes! No, his Patience is the Fruit of his Goodneſs, or rather as the Scripture Terms it, <hi>a Diſplay of his Power.</hi> And hence he is ſaid, <hi>to be ſlow to Anger and great in Power,</hi> Nahum i. 3. and Rom. ix. 22. God is ſaid <hi>to make his Power known in enduring with much Long-ſuffering, the Veſſels of Wrath fitted to Deſtruction.</hi> And hence ſome deſcribe God's Patience, to be <hi>a Power of defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Execution of his Wrath.</hi> 2dly. Another Act of <hi>Patience</hi> conſiſts in the Moderation of Puniſhments when inflicted, ſo that they are not equal to the deſert of Sin. Pſal. ciii. 10. <hi>He hath not dealt with us after our Sins nor rewarded us according to our Iniquities.</hi> The Almighty ſtirs
<pb n="346" facs="unknown:005500_0349_10396669D6ABF480"/>
not up all his Wrath at once, but puniſhes gradually. He ſtays his rough Wind in the Day of his Eaſt Wind, and trys Rods before he ſends Scorpions. But 3dly. The Place were God exerciſes his Patience, is this World, which is a ſtate of Probation or Tryal, whereas the next is a ſtate of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Puniſhments. The Damned cannot be ſaid to be the Objects of God's Patience, becauſe they endure the Viols of God's Vengeance, in a degree proportioned to their demerit. And altho' the Devils are not expos'd to ſo great a Weight of Woe and Vengeance as they will be after the general Judgment; which is intimated, by their being <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in chains under Darkneſs to the Judgment of the great Day.</hi> Jud. 6. As well as by their Queſtion to our Saviour, Mat. viii. 29. <hi>Art thou come to torment us before our Time?</hi> Yet this leſs degree of Puniſhment inflicted on them, has no where in Scripture the Denomination of <hi>Patience:</hi> It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains therefore that Men are the only Objects of it, and that while in this World. But</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. The <hi>Time</hi> wherein <hi>Patience</hi> is exerciſed, is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally a long Duration, tho' not always: The juſt God makes quick Work with ſome, and lets his terrible ſeverity ſuddainly triumph in their ruin, as in the Caſe of <hi>Kora<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> and his Accomplices, <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> and others. But for the moſt Part Jehovah ſuſpends the falling Blow for a conſiderable Seaſon, even till there be no remedy! In civil Courts of Judicature, there is uſually but a little Space between the Sentence and Execution, and it is but Juſt it ſhould be ſo. But Jehovah mercifully waits, and is not ſpeedy in coming out againſt the Sinner. Eccleſ. viii. 11. <hi>Sentence againſt an evil Work is not ſpedily executed.</hi> The Almighty expoſtulates the Caſe and uſes a variety of Methods to reclaim impenitent Tranſgreſſors, before he lets his Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance light upon them to deſtroy them. This is well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented

in the following Places of Scripture, Jer. ii. 5. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, what Iniquity have your Fathers found in me, that they have gone ſo far from me, and have walked after Vanity and become vain?</hi> Jer. viii. 6. <hi>I hearkned and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eard, but they ſpake not aright, no Man repented him of his Wickedneſs, ſaying what have I done. Every one turned to his Courſe, as the Horſe ruſheth into the Battle!</hi> I proceed to conſider <hi>the Riches of divine Patience;</hi> which was the</p>
            <p n="2">2d. Propos'd. Now the following Particulars ſerve as Foils to illuſtrate the Greatneſs of God's Patience, in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing to execute his Vengeance upon Tranſgreſſors. And</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Let it be conſidered, that God is Infinite and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoted in Holineſs, and inflexible in his Juſtice, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot but abhor Sin with an unalterable and eternal Antipathy. And</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. How great is the Offence committed againſt God by every Sin? Seeing that the Sinner hereby interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, prefers Creatures, yea his Luſts before the Bleſſed God! And therefore as much as in him lies, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to dethrone the Almighty. The exceeding contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Sin to the untainted Purity of the divine Nature, is ſet forth in ſtrong Terms, accommodated to our Manner of Conception in the following Places of Scripture, Amos ii. 13. <hi>Behold I am preſs'd under you, as a Cart is preſs'd that is full of Sheaves.</hi> Ezek. vi. 9. <hi>I am broken with their whoriſh Heart, which hath departed from me!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3dly. The Heighnouſneſs of ſome Sins above others, ſerve to heighten our Conceptions of the divine Patience: All Iniquities are not equally aggravated, ſome are of a ſlighter Tincture, and ſome of a crimſon Hue; a deep a double Dye, (Iſa. i. 18.) And ſuch are Sins againſt Light, Love, covenant Engagements, and Rebukes of Providence; and more eſpecially our ſlighting and neglecting of the Lord
<pb n="348" facs="unknown:005500_0351_103966668E9F1678"/>
JESUS CHRIST. Hereby the deareſt Love is undervalu'd and the yearning Bowels of the moſt compaſſionate pity ſpurn'd againſt; yea the precious Blood of the adorable <hi>Imanuel</hi> trod under Foot, O aſtoniſhing monſtrous Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude! And more amazing Patience, that forbears executing deſerv'd Vengeance upon ſuch Tranſgreſſors! And</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. What a prodigious Number of Sins are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted every Moment, yea of the vileſt Kind? Surely innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Evils do compaſs us about, <hi>if the Tongue be a World of Iniquity,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> obſerves, (Jam. iii. 6.) <hi>what then ſhall be ſaid of all the Members together;</hi> which are as ſo many Fountains of Impiety? Who then can underſtand his Errors? If the moſt Patient Man alive was to behold at once the Multitude of Evils which God beholds together with their Filthineſs: Surely if it was in his Power the World would not ſtand many Moments! And yet the All-knowing infinitely holy God forbears bringing Judgment to the Plumet! I ſay forbears to ſweep obſtinate ungrateful Tranſgreſſors off the Stage of Time into a deluge of endleſs Woe and Ruin, O aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Patience! Patience worthy of a God, and which none but he can exerciſe! Tho' Sinners as it were fly in the Face of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> run upon the thick Boſſes of his Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, bid Defience to Omnipotence, baſely trample upon his Authority and his Love, and by every impious Art try to provoke a God to Arms, as if they were ſtronger than he: Yet notwithſtanding all this, <hi>Jehovah</hi> forbears to give the fatal Blow, behold and be aſtoniſh'd ye Heavens and Earth at this! And</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. It adds Weight to this Argument, when we conſider the Almightineſs of the God of Patience, how eaſily, ſpeedily, and fully can he avenge all the Affronts that are caſt upon his Honour, all the Invaſions that are
<pb n="349" facs="unknown:005500_0352_10396664ECEC6D60"/>
made upon the Rights of Heaven? It coſt him but a Word to make the Heavens and Earth exiſt, one Word of <hi>Jehovah</hi> would ſpeak the Offender Dead, or make him ceaſe to be! The Lord has a Sovereign Empire over the whole Univerſe, when he ſpeaks all Nature trembles before him, the Thunder of his Power who can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand! <hi>Conſider this therefore ye that forget God, leaſt he tear you in Pieces when there ſhall be none to deliver. Pſ.</hi> l. 22.</p>
            <p n="6">6thly. Moreover the many Meaſures which divine Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy uſes to reclaim the Impenitent by the <hi>Word, Spirit Providence,</hi> in its proſperous and adverſe Aſpects, may help us to admire the more at that Patience, which endures the Abuſe of all. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 20. <hi>Now then we are Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors for</hi> CHRIST, <hi>as tho' God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in</hi> CHRIST<hi>'S ſtead, be ye reconcil'd to God!</hi> And</p>
            <p n="7">7thly. We may add to what has been ſaid, the inu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Benefits which the indulgent God without any Demerit oftentimes heaps upon the vileſt Tranſgreſſors. <hi>Pſ.</hi> lxxiii. 12. <hi>Behold theſe are the ungodly who proſper in the World, they increaſe in Riches!</hi> Yea how Precious and Important is the Treaſure of Time which is confer'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all? Beſides many other Benefits which the Seaſon for this exerciſe would fail to innumerate! Reſpecting all which we may accoſt the impenitent Sinner in the Language of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans</hi> xxiv. 5. <hi>Deſpiſeſt thou the Riches of his Goodneſs and Forbearance, not knowing that the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God leadeth thee to Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8thly. The quick Diſpatch that divine Juſtice has made with ſome, witneſs <hi>Uzza, Nadab, Abihu, Achan, Herod,</hi> and divers others, who perhaps all Circumſtances conſidered have not committed greater Evils than we, is a great Illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of God's Long-ſuffering towards us, Rom. xi. 22.
<pb n="350" facs="unknown:005500_0353_103966631DB7F4B8"/>
               <hi>Behold the Goodneſs and Severity of God on them which fell Severity; but towards thee, Goodneſs, if thou continue in his Goodneſs, otherwiſe thou alſo ſhall't be cut off!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9thly. Once more me thinks the Length of the Time that Patience has been exercis'd towards us, is a pregnant Argument of the Greatneſs and Riches of it. Has not <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah</hi> reſtrain'd the Execution of his Wrath, and waited to be Gracious to ſome of us, this <hi>Twenty, Thirty, Forty, Fifty,</hi> or <hi>Sixty</hi> Years? While in the mean Time we have been trampling upon his awful Authority, and ſlighting the dear Caraſſes of his manifold Mercy, O amazing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience! When the Angels ſin'd, they were quickly caſt down to Hell, and made Monuments of divine Vengeance, and behold we who have been Tranſgreſſors from the Womb are yet ſpared! Surely it had been nothing but an Act of Juſtice in God to have caſt every Soul of us into utter Darkneſs, many a Year agone: And yet we are alive, and on this ſide the burning Lake, and have the Offers of Mercy and Salvation made to us, O the unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd Patience of God! O may his Long-ſuffering lead us to Repentance, and be Salvation to us!</p>
            <p>But that I may farther illuſtrate this Argument of the <hi>Riches</hi> of <hi>divine Patience,</hi> it will not be a miſs to add the following Diſplays thereof.</p>
            <p>When our firſt Parents had revolted from their Duty and Allegiance to God, by Tranſgreſſing the Covenant of Works, and we in them. Might not God in Juſtice have made them and their Off-ſpring immediately and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally Miſerable, without any Hopes of a Retrieve? Yes ſurely! To what then can we aſcribe the Delay of Juſtice and Expenſe of Goodneſs to them and us, but to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Long-ſuffering?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="351" facs="unknown:005500_0354_103966619A242380"/>And after the fatal Shipwreck of our firſt Parents, when in ſucceeding Time the <hi>Antidiluvian</hi> World had ſunk into ſuch dreadful Degeneracy, that all Fleſh had corrupted their Way; and the Almighty was hereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd to threaten a Deludge of Judgment, as extenſive as the moral Contagion that procur'd it: Yet before it was inflicted, the God of Patience allowed them <hi>One Hundred</hi> and <hi>Twenty</hi> Years warning, by <hi>Noah</hi> a preacher of Righteouſnes; dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which Space the Long-ſuffering of God waited on them. (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> iii. 20. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> ii. 5.) And had not the Church of the Jews great Experience of the Patience of God? Tho' the Power and Love of God were marvelouſly manifeſted, in delivering that People from the moſt oppreſſive Bondage in <hi>Egypt,</hi> as well as in preſerving of them, and providing for them in their Way to <hi>Canaan.</hi> The whole was effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the mighty Hand, and outſtretched Arm of God, by a Series of moſt aſtoniſhing Miracles! Yet after all, what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, Idolatry, Murmurings and Perverſeneſs, was that People ſo highly favoured guilty of, and yet were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd? Hence the Almighty is ſaid to <hi>ſuffer their Manners in the Wilderneſs forty Years, Acts</hi> xiii. 18. And tho' their Idolatries afterwards were ſcandalous to the laſt degree, yet Patience was exercis'd, Deliverers many Times rais'd up for them, and Judgments but ſlowly executed, and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a mixture of Mercy: And even after they had bro't their crimſon Impieties to the moſt horid Criſis, by crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Son of God! A Prodigy of Wickedneſs, which the Sun himſelf refus'd to behold! An Impiety at which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious Earth trembled with Horror and Regret! Yet did divine Patience ſpare them for a conſiderable ſpace of Time, till they had the Offers of Life repeatedly made to them by the primitive Preachers of the Goſpel, as well as repeated Warnings of their juſt and approaching Ruin! It was a
<pb n="352" facs="unknown:005500_0355_1039665FE3311C08"/>
matter of Forty Years after, that unhappy and ungrateful Nation, had judged themſelves unworthy of eternal Life, by rejecting the Apoſtolical Warnings and Invitations before their Metropolis was ſack'd, and themſelves diſpers'd and almoſt wholly deſtroy'd by the Sword of <hi>Titus Veſpaſian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Jewiſh Church and Nation, are not the only Sharers, of the rich Expence of divine Patience. The Gentiles alſo tho' guilty of the moſt infand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ous Iniquities, directly contrary to Natures Light, have had large Experience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And hence God is ſaid, <hi>in Time paſt to ſuffer all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to walk in their own Ways, and to give them Rain from Heaven, and fruitful Seaſons, filling their Hearts with Food and Gladneſs,</hi> Acts xiv. 16, 17. Yea and it is no inconſiderable Inſtance of the Long-ſuffering of God, that it has been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to falſe Teachers, who have endeavour'd to ſeduce and corrupt the Church of God. Theſe likewiſe have had a <hi>Space given them to repent, tho' they repented not, Rev.</hi> ii. 21. But to proceed,</p>
            <p>Methinks the Methods of the divine Proceedings, even in inflicting of Judgments upon Tranſgreſſors, if cloſely attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, may aſſiſt our Conceptions of the Riches of God's Patience.</p>
            <p>Before Judgment is executed, the gracious God doth ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally give by his Servants, plain and frequent Warning. And hence it is ſaid, <hi>that he hew'd the People of Iſrael by his Prophets, and ſlew them by the Words of his Mouth. He ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth once, yea twice, but Man perceiveth it not, that he may withdraw Man from his purpoſe, and hide Pride from Man.</hi> Job. xxxiii. 14, 17.</p>
            <p>And when Sinners ſlight the divine Warnings, obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuſing to be reclaim'd, and ſo render the inflicting of Judgment neceſſary to vindicate the Honour of God's Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Behold the long-ſuffering God uſes a Gradation
<pb n="353" facs="unknown:005500_0356_1039665E3ACFB9A0"/>
herein, by ſending a Succeſſion of leſſer Judgments, before more awful Calamities are inflicted. And hence the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God are compar'd to the <hi>Light that goeth forth;</hi> that is the Morning Light, which by degrees increaſes to a perfect Day, the Morning Sun gradually aſcends to his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian Height, or to the Vertex of the Horiſon (<hi>Hoſ.</hi>

               </gap>i. 5.) Thus the Prophet <hi>Joel</hi> relates a Series of divine Judgments, which were inflicted upon the People of Iſrael, (<hi>Joel</hi> i. 4.) Firſt the <hi>Palmer Worm,</hi> then the <hi>Locuſt,</hi> after that the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker-Worm,</hi> and then the <hi>Caterpiller</hi> devoured the Fruits of the Earth. And <hi>Amos</hi> obſerves likewiſe, that God ſent firſt a Famine, <hi>and afterwards overthrew ſome of them as Sodom and Gomorha,</hi> (Amos iv. 8, 11.)</p>
            <p>The Almighty in executing of his Judgments, doth ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally moderate them, ſo that they are not equal to the Demerit of Sin. Of this the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, <hi>Iſa.</hi> xxvii. 7, 8. <hi>Hath he ſmitten him, as he ſmote thoſe that ſmote him, or is he ſlain according to the Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of them that are ſlain by him?

he wept over it! ſaying, <hi>If thou hadſt known,</hi> or as ſome render the Words, <hi>O that thou hadſt known, in this thy Day, the Things that concern'd thy Peace, but now they are hid from thine Eyes</hi> Luke xix. 41 But it's Time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the</p>
            <p n="3">3d. Propos'd, which was to ſpeak of the Reaſons of God's Patience. And</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. One Reaſon is, God's <hi>good</hi> and <hi>beneficent Nature,</hi> which is more prone to Mercy than Judgment. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is his Delight, but the latter is his ſtrange Work. And hence it is ſaid <hi>Lam.</hi> iii. 33. <hi>That he afflicts not willingly, or grives the Children of Men.</hi> Jer xxxi. 20. <hi>Is Ephraim my dear Son? Is he a pleaſant Child?

I will ſurely have Mercy upon him ſaith the Lord.</hi> God's Goodneſs and Long-ſuffering are doubtleſs eminent Branches of his manifeſtative Glory: For when <hi>Moſes</hi> deſired a Sight thereof, this Name was proclaimed. <hi>Ex.</hi> xxxiv. 6. <hi>The Lord, the Lord, merciful and gracious, long ſuffering, and abundant in Goodneſs.</hi> And theſe the Almighty claims as his peculiar Prerogatives, as appears by that famous Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Hoſ</hi> xi. 9. <hi>I will not execute the Fierceneſs of my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, for I am God and not Man.</hi> Man is impatient and full of Reſentment. It is a juſt Obſervation of Mr. <hi>Bolton,</hi> 
               <q>That if any tender Hearted Man, ſhould ſit one Hour in the Throne of God Almighty, and look down upon the Earth, as God doth continually; and ſee what Abominations are done in that Hour, he would undoubtedly in the next ſet all the World on Fire.</q> But the Lord is God and not Man, his Patience has no Parallel among all created Beings.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. Another Reaſon of divine Forbearance, is the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of God's <hi>Glory.</hi> Jehovah is not only induced to Patience, by the Kindneſs of his Nature, but likewiſe by the
<pb n="355" facs="unknown:005500_0358_1039665B08F0AA70"/>
Glory of his Name. <hi>Iſa.</hi> xlviii. 9, 11. <hi>For my Name ſake will I defer mine Anger, and for my Praiſe will I refrain from thee, that I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ut thee not off. For mine own Sake, even for mine own Sake will I do it. For how ſhould my Name be polluted, and I will not give my Glory to another.</hi> An Example of this we have in <hi>Pharaoh, Ex.</hi> ix. 16. <hi>And in very Deed for this Cauſe have I rais'd thee up, for to ſhew in thee my Power, and that my Name may be declar'd through out all the Earth.</hi> And</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. The Lord exerciſes Long-ſuffering becauſe of his Promiſe made to pious People, and their Offspring. <hi>Gen.</hi> xvii. 7. <hi>And I will eſtabliſh my Covenant between me and thee, and thy Seed after thee in their Generations, for an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant to be a God unto thee, and to thy Seed after thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4thly. Another Reaſon of God's Patience is, that ſome may be hereby induced to repent of their evil Ways. <hi>Rom.</hi> ii. 4. <hi>Or deſpiſeſt thou the Riches of his Goodneſs, Forbearance and Long-ſuffering, not knowing that the Goodneſs of God leadeth thee to Repentance.</hi> And indeed Men are loſt to all Senſe of Humanity and Gratitude, if the Conſideration of God's Goodneſs and Long-ſuffering, does not excite their Sorrows for their Offences againſt him. Memorable are the Words of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> upon this Subject. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> iii. 9. <hi>The Lord is not ſlack concerning his Promiſe, as ſome Men count Slackneſs, but is long-ſuffering to usward, not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5thly. The Almighty forbears to execute Vengeance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Mixture of good People with bad in this World, and from the Regard he bears to the Prayers of the Former. <hi>Gen.</hi> xix. 21, 22. <hi>And he ſaid unto him, ſee I have accepted thee concerning this Thing alſo, that I will not overthrow this City; for the which thou haſt ſpoken, Haſte thee eſcape thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="356" facs="unknown:005500_0359_10396659471F3248"/>
for I cannot do any Thing till thou become thither; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the City was called</hi> Zoar. The Holy Seed, <hi>i. e,</hi> pious People, are the Subſtance, the Support of Places where they are. (<hi>Iſa.</hi> vi. 13.) And hence it is ſaid, <hi>Iſa.</hi> xix. <hi>Except the Lord of Hoſts had left unto us a very ſmall Remnant, we ſhould have been as</hi> Sodom,—<hi>and like unto</hi> Gomorah.</p>
            <p n="6">6thly. Another Reaſon of God's Patience, is to continue, and propagate his Church in the World. <hi>Rev.</hi> vi. 10, 11. <hi>And they cried with a loud Voice ſaying, how long O Lord Holy and true, doſt thou not judge and avenge our Blood on them that dwell on the Earth?—And it was ſaid unto them, that they ſhould reſt, yet for a little Seaſon, until their fellow Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and Brethren,—ſhould be fulfilled,</hi> i. e. until their Number was compleated. The Church could not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued from Age to Age, if God was ſpeedy in the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Wrath. Many of the Elect are doubtleſs in the Loyns of impious Parents, who are ſpar'd for their Sakes. Again</p>
            <p n="7">7thly. Patience is exercis'd, to render Sinners who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in their Impenitence inexcuſable; and to vindicate the Juſtice of God in their final Ruin. (<hi>Rom.</hi> ii. 1, 2, 4.) The long continuance, and rich Expence of divine Patience towards impenitent Sinners, bereave them of all Apology in their own Favour! <hi>This, this</hi> will make them wholly ſpeechleſs, before the Judgment Bar of the incarnate God! they will not be able to offer one Plea in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. The</p>
            <p n="4">4th. Propos'd comes now to be ſpoke upon, namely, the conſiſtency of divine Patience, with God's vindicative Juſtice, and this will appear by conſidering the following Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt As there is an equal neceſſity of glorifying the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of Patience, as of God's other Perfections, ſo there is no Time for this but in the preſent World. Neither the
<pb n="357" facs="unknown:005500_0360_10396657A31CE440"/>
Sav'd or Damn'd are Objects of Patience, the former need it not, and the latter are paſt it. Then either it muſt be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted here or not at all; but there will be ſufficient Room for the Terrible Diſplays of Juſtice in another World.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. Seeing that the Deſign of avenging Juſtice is either to manifeſt God's Holineſs, or to ſecure the Rights of his Sovereignty, then if both theſe can be anſwered, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Exerciſe of Patience, there is ſurely a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency and Harmony between them, and that this is the very Caſe appears thus: God's Holineſs is manifeſted in his Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings againſt Tranſgreſſors, the Execution of which his Truth ſtands engaged to ſecure. The juſt <hi>Jehovah</hi> has ſaid, That <hi>he will rain upon Sinners Snares, Fire, and Brimſtrone, and an horrible Tempeſt, and this ſhall be the Portion of their Cup! For the Lord loveth Righteouſneſs, Pſa.</hi> xi. 6, 7. And tho' this be a Time of Probation, yet in order to vindicate God's Holineſs and Juſtice, there be ſome Executions of Wrath. Hence the Lord is ſaid <hi>to be known by the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which he executes, and that the wicked are ſnared in the Work of their own Hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither does a temporary Suſpenſion of the full Executions of Juſtice, give any Occaſion to Sinners to inſult the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Sovereignty; nay, to ingenious Minds, it is rather an Inducement to ſubmit to the divine Government, ſeeing he is ſo full of Clemency. Slow Proceedings in Judgment, and Reprieves granted to Malefactors, are no Reproach; but an Honour to civil Governments; and why ſhould the ſame mild Meaſures be reckon'd an Impeachment upon the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine? But I haſten to the Improvement of this Subject. And 1ſt. We may learn from it the exceeding Preciouſneſs of the Souls of Men. Our Lord, who is the beſt Judge of the Worth of Things, eſteems one of them worth more <hi>than the whole World, Mat.</hi> xvi. 29. And this he has teſtify'd
<pb n="358" facs="unknown:005500_0361_10396655F964B020"/>
by the Price he has laid down for them, which was no leſs than his own moſt precious Blood, (1. <hi>Pet.</hi> i. 19.) As well as by the importunate Methods he uſes in order to apply this Redemption, and particularly by the Expence of his Patience in waiting to be Gracious to poor Sinners. And why then ſhould we not value our own Souls, and expreſs this by ſuitable Solicitude, and Labours to ſecure their Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs? And</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. From the Patience of God we may learn this Leſſon, that it is better for us to be at the Mercy of God than of any Creature: Tho' <hi>Moſes</hi> was meek above all Men upon the Face of the Earth, yet the Impieties of the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> put him in a Rage againſt them, ſo that he accoſted them in the following Language at <hi>Meriba, You Rebels</hi> ſaid he, <hi>muſt I draw Water for you out of the Rock?</hi> The Prophet <hi>Jonah</hi> ſeem'd to be more concern'd about his Credit, than about the Lives of the great City <hi>Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h;</hi> yea he was diſpleas'd and very Angry at the Kindneſs of God, in ſparing that ſinful Place upon their Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and acoſted the Almighty in very undecent Language on this Occaſion: yea he reſented the Kindneſs of God to that Place in ſuch a Degree, that he choſe Death rather than Life on this Account! O ſtrange and unaccountable Conduct! (<hi>See Jona</hi> iv. 1.2.3.) But</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. Another Uſe that may be juſtly drawn from this Subject of divine Patience, is of Encouragement to all Sinſick Souls; ſuch ſhould be induc'd hereby to caſt away their deſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nding Fears, and to come to JESUS CHRIST with Hopes of obtaining Mercy. To this he invites them in a compaſſionate Manner, <hi>Mat.</hi> xi. 28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy Laden, and I will give you Reſt:</hi> And ſurely our dear Lord will be as Good as his Word. The Enemy of Souls labours to diſcourage awakned Sinners
<pb n="359" facs="unknown:005500_0362_10396653E8C66E48"/>
in their Motions to CHRIST by many dreadful ſuggeſtions ſuch as theſe following, <hi>viz.</hi> That they have committed the unpardonable Sin; but how can that be while they bewail Sin and ſeek Deliverance from it? Or by inſinuating that the Seaſon of Mercy is paſt, and that God is ſo ſevere that he will have no Compaſſion on them. But theſe are falſe Suggeſtions, how can the Day of Mercy be paſt when God is enlightning the Mind and humbling the Heart by his gracious Influences? No! It is then a ſpecial Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Mercy, the Door of Hope is yet open, and the golden Scepter of Pardon and Peace is held forth by the King of Glory. God is not waiting for an Opportunity to deſtroy the Sinner, but for an Opportunity to exalt his glorious Grace in ſhewing them Salvation: Poor Sinners, ye are going to a God of Mercy, Grace and Patience, a God who glories in the Freeneſs of his Love! Surely if his Patience bore with you in your obſtinate Courſe of unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting Impieties, it will much more ſo when you are humbled under a Senſe thereof: Therefore be encouraged to attend with Hope upon the Means of Grace, and to venture your guilty Souls by believing on an all-ſufficient and compaſſionate Redeemer, who is able to ſave to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt all that come to the Father by him, and who has himſelf aſſur'd us, that ſuch as come he will by no Means caſt out. But I proceed</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. To a Uſe of Exhortation in the following Particulars And</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Dear Brethren, let us admire and adore the Patience of God towards ourſelves! And to this we may be juſtly excited by conſidering the Number, Importance and Long-continuance of the Favours of God towards us, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the inumerable and heighnous Iniquities which we have preſumptuouſly and ungratefully committed againſt
<pb n="360" facs="unknown:005500_0363_10396652664881B0"/>
all the dear Obligations of divine Love! If God ſhould mark Iniquities who could ſtand before him? How juſtly therefore, and how eaſily might the Almighty have made us Miſerable, beyond a Remedy long before now? And yet <hi>Jehovah</hi>'s Patience waits. Sometimes Men defer the Execution of their Anger, becauſe they are not able to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it: This was King <hi>David</hi>'s Caſe in ſuſpending <hi>Joab</hi>'s Puniſhment. The Sons of <hi>Zeruiah,</hi> as he himſelf acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, were too hard for him, they had got ſo great a Party of the Nation upon their Side, that it was perilous to try to bring them ſpeedily to publick Juſtice: But God is Almighty in Power, and eaſily able at any Time, in an Inſtant, to ſubdue the moſt Proud and Potent of his Enemies. It may juſtly melt our Hearts into Admiration and Gratitude, when we think how juſtly every Soul of us here preſent might be this Moment enduring the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of eternal Fire, paſt all Hopes of ever obtaining Mercy; and that yet notwithſtanding of all our crimſon Provocations we are on this ſide Ruin, and have the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of Salvation made to us. But in the</p>
            <p n="2">2d. Place let us beware that we abuſe not the Patience of God by taking Encouragement therefrom to perſiſt in ſinning againſt him. This alas is the ungrateful Uſe which ſome make of this adorable Attribute, <hi>Ecleſ.</hi> viii. 11. <hi>Becauſe Sentence againſt an evil Work, is not ſpeedily executed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Heart of the Sons of Men is fully ſet in them to do Evil.</hi> The Baſeneſs of which Ingratitude and Impiety, no Tongue can expreſs, no Mind can conceive fully: And ſurely the Puniſhment will be at laſt proportioned to it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Repentance intercept the Stroke of Juſtice! <hi>How ſhall ye eſcape who neglect ſo great Salvation? It ſhall be more tolerable for</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorah <hi>in the Day of Judgment than for you.</hi> Do not imagine Sinners that Forbearance is
<pb n="361" facs="unknown:005500_0364_10396650C0653A10"/>
Payment. <hi>Be not deceived, that which a Man ſows that ſhall be alſo reap, he that ſoweth to the Fleſh, ſhall of the Fleſh reap Corruption.</hi> Conſider ſolemnly and ſpeedily thoſe dreadful Words of God himſelf, Pſal. l. 21, 22. <hi>Theſe Things haſt thou done and I kept Silent, thou thoughteſt that I was altogether ſuch a one as thy ſelf, but I will reprove thee and ſet them in Order before thine Eyes. Now conſider this ye that forget God, leaſt I tear you in Pieces and there be none to deliver!</hi> And how unjuſt, as well as ungrateful, is the Inference which ſome impenitent Tranſgreſſors draw from the expenſe of divine Patience, <hi>viz.</hi> that therefore there is no Providence which preſides over human Affairs; and hence they deride all Religion! The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> long ſince prophecy'd of this herd of hardned Mortals. (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> iii. 4.) But where is the Senſe of this Cavil, for will not Reaſon it ſelf ſuggeſt, that there ſhould be a Time of Probation before that of Recompence?</p>
            <p>But that I may come more cloſely to the Conſciences of my Hearers, may I not ſafely aſſert, that all you that neglect to improve the preſent Seaſon of Mercy, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to embrace the Lord JESUS CHRIST, are abuſers of God's Patience! Dear Friends, conſider, that in ſo doing ye deſpiſe the Goodneſs and Long-ſuffering of God, and likewiſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and aggravate your own Ruin. (<hi>Rom.</hi> ii. 4.) Hear with Trembling what God ſaid to his antient People, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos iii. 3. <hi>You only have I known of all the Families of the Earth, therefore I will puniſh you for all you Iniquities!</hi> I haſten to the laſt Uſe, which is of Exhortation, which is threefold: Methinks the Patience of God invites us to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it, in Relation to God, our Neighbours, and ourſelves. And 1ſt. We ſhould improve it in Relation to our Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our towards God, in a Patient enduring of his fatherly Chaſtnings, which are ſo much to our Advantage, and ſo
<pb n="362" facs="unknown:005500_0365_1039664EA68E4CE0"/>
much leſs than our demerit. We ſhould likewiſe patiently wait for the Anſwer of our Prayers, as well as for the Time of our Diſſolution; <hi>for God hath not ſaid to the ſeed of</hi> Jacob, <hi>that they ſhould ſeek his Face in vain.</hi> The Time of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture is fixed, and cannot be reverſed, let us therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve with <hi>Job,</hi> to wait with Patience till our Change come.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. In Relation to Men. Let us bear Injuries and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches from them with Patience, without meditating Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, ſeeing the great God has ſo long bore with worſe Treatment from us! Let us patiently wait for the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of unconverted Friends and Relatives: God's Power is great, his Grace is free, ſome he Converts at one Time and ſome at another! Jehovah waits and why ſhould not we with Patience and Hope.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. In Relation to ourſelves. O for God's ſake let us improve the preſent Seaſon of divine Patience! <hi>Behold now is the accepted Time, behold now is the Day of Salvation!</hi> Grieve the Spirit of God no more, and try his Patience no longer; for ſurely if ye perſiſt, divine Patience towards you will have its Period, and then ye are undone forever. Think on theſe Words, Pro. i. 24, 25, 26. <hi>Becauſe I called and ye refuſed, I ſtretched forth my Hand and no Man regarded, therefore will I laugh at your Calamities, and mock when your fear cometh.</hi>

            <p>THIS Pſalm was compos'd either when David was in great Diſtreſs, or ſometime afterwards in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of it, and of the Kindneſs and Truth of God, apparent in delivering him therefrom. The Matter of the Pſalm, which conſiſts of Prayers and Praiſes, of Hopes and Fears, ſeems to ſuggeſt what has been obſerv'd to be Occaſion of it's Compoſure; but we can't certainly determine what thoſe Troubles were to which the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> refers herein: Some learned Men, particularly <hi>Muis</hi> from <hi>David Kimchi,</hi> whoſe Opinion Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> in his <hi>Synopſis</hi> favours, do not improbably Conjecture, that it was compos'd when <hi>David</hi> fled from <hi>Saul.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> had, in the preceeding Verſes, mention'd ſome Diſtreſs he was in, ſome diſguis'd Contrivance which his Enemy's had ſecretly form'd to enſnare him, as well as ſpoken honourably of the divine Power in a Variety of metaphorical Terms, and earneſtly implor'd Guidance in Perplexity, and Protection in Danger, he in confidence thereof, doth in the Words of our Text, calmly commend himſelf to the divine Care, being hereunto encouraged by the Conſideration of what God had done for him in diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
<pb n="364" facs="unknown:005500_0367_1039664B826572F8"/>
heretofore, and believing God was engaged to do the like for him in future Time. <hi>Into thine Hand I commit my Spirit, for thou haſt redeemed me, O Lord God of Truth!</hi> So that in theſe Words, we have two Things, viz. An Account of the Pſalmiſt's Act, together with the Reaſons of it. And 1ſt. His Act was his committing his Spirit into the Hands of God. By <hi>Spirit</hi> we are doubtleſs to underſtand his Soul, it was in this Senſe that our Lord us'd theſe Words upon the Croſs. (<hi>Luk.</hi> xxxiii. 46.) By the <hi>Hand</hi> of God, we are to underſtand his Care and Cuſtody, the metaphorical Expreſſion of Arm, when apply'd to God in Scripture, intends his Strength, ſo that to be taken into the Hands of God in a Way of Mercy, ſignifies a Perſon's Being cover'd with Almighty Protection! <hi>Committing ourſelves into the Hands of God,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes in it theſe three Things eſpecially <hi>viz.</hi> 1ſt. A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting all other Dependencies. 2dly. A firm Truſt in God that he can and will do all well for us. And 3dly. A voluntary Reſignation of ourſelves intirely to his Care and Kindneſs. But</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. The Reaſons of the <hi>Pſalmiſt's</hi> Act are theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> 1ſt. The Remembrance he had of God's <hi>Kindneſs</hi> to him formerly, in delivering him out of Troubles: <hi>For thou haſt redeemed me.</hi> And 2dly. The Conſideration of the Truth of God's <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Word, O Lord God of Truth,</hi> as if he had ſaid, thou haſt promiſed O Lord, that thou wilt be preſent with thy People in Diſtreſs, and help them; and ſurely thou wilt be as good as thy Word, for thou art the God of Truth. The Remembrance of paſt Mercies and Deliverances, both Spiritual and Temporal is of great Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity in our Chriſtian Courſe, both to excite our Gratitude to God, and encourage our Truſt in him. If we do not remember the <hi>Hill-Mizar,</hi> the <hi>Peniels,</hi> the <hi>Piſgas,</hi> the
<pb n="365" facs="unknown:005500_0368_10396649DB91B958"/>
               <hi>Bokims</hi> that we have met with, how ſhall we love our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors and hope in him? And without Love and Hope how can we perform the Duties required of us with Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence? Encounter the Dangers we are inviron'd with, without Courage, or ſuſtain the Difficulties we are expoſed to, with Patience? Was not our Lord offended with his Diſciples that they ſo ſoon forgot the Miracle about the Loaves? How peircing and upbraiding was the reproof of CHRIST on this Occaſion? <hi>O ye Fools and ſlow of Heart to believe, do ye not remember the Miracle of the Loaves?</hi>

            <p>The Subject that I purpoſe to diſcourſe upon from the Text, is, <hi>the Truth of God.</hi> This <hi>Attribute</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> is frequently aſcrib'd to God in Scripture. Hence (1) He is expreſly ſaid <hi>to be True,</hi> Jer. x. 10. <hi>But the Lord is the True God</hi> (2) It is likewiſe ſaid, <hi>that he cannot lie or repent,</hi> 1 Sam. xv. 29. <hi>And alſo the Strength of</hi> Iſrael <hi>will not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e or repent, for he is not a Man that he ſhould repent.</hi> Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly (3) In his <hi>Words,</hi> he is True yea Truth itſelf. Joh. xvii. 17. <hi>Sanctify them thro' thy Truth, thy Word is Truth.</hi> (4) In his Works, thus <hi>all the Ways of the Lord are</hi> ſaid to be <hi>Mercy and Truth, unto ſuch as keep his Covenant.</hi> Pſal. xxv. 10.</p>
            <p>And it muſt needs be that God is True, if we conſider the following Particulars, 1ſt. If God were not true, there could be nothing True, or no Truth; for how can there be a ſecond Truth without a firſt? But there is ſuch a Thing as Truth, therefore God is true. It is equally abſurd to ſuppoſe, either that the Creature has any Vertue, which it has not deriv'd from God the firſt Cauſe of all Being and Goodneſs, or that it ſhould derive it from one who had it not. 2dly. All falſehood and deceit ſprings from ſome Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, either of Ignorance or perverſe Intention. Men often miſtake thro' Ignorance or Inadvertency; they think
<pb n="366" facs="unknown:005500_0369_10396648384B7020"/>
of Things otherwiſe than they are, either thro' want of a competent meaſure of Knowledge or thro' neglect of due Deliberation upon Things, neither of which are compatible to that God who is infinite in Wiſdom, and Acts by Council.</p>
            <p>Again Men deceive others of Purpoſe, thro' an evil Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Nature, the Root of which is in all the Poſterity of <hi>Adam!</hi> But God is perfectly Pure and Holy, entirely free from every corrupt Byaſs. And hence is that antitheſis or contrariety between the divine Nature, and the Human in its degenerate and fallen State; which is mentioned Rom. iii. 4. <hi>Yea let God be True, but every Man a Lyar; as it is written, that thou mighteſt be juſtify'd in thy ſayings, and mighteſt overcome when thou judgeſt.</hi> When therefore God is ſaid <hi>to deceive the Prophet, Ezek.</hi> xiv. 9. It only ſignifies the Almighty's diſappointing him by the Courſe of his all-governing Providence, of the fond Expectations he had from ſecond Cauſes, and his ſuffering the Prophet to impoſe upon himſelf by wrong Conjectures. Men may be influenced by the vicious Propenſities of their own Natures, or by the Inſtigations of Satan to deceive. But it is directly contrary to, and incompatible with the infinite untainted and inviolable purity of the divine Nature to be any Ways ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſuch abhored Impiety. <hi>It is impoſſible for God to lie,</hi> as the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> juſtly obſerves, (<hi>Heb.</hi> vi. 18.)</p>
            <p>Men do not always adhere with conſtancy to their Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Declarations, either, 1ſt. Becauſe they were raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and precipitantly made, without a juſt View of Things, and mature Deliberation upon them. Or 2dly. For want of Power to put their Deſigns into Execution, or 3dly. Becauſe of ſome unforeſeen Changes that are brought to paſs by divine Providence, which put their Affairs into a different Situati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               </gap> what they were before; and from what they firſt had in View. But neither of theſe Imperfections can be aſcrib'd without Blaſphemy to God. As his Wiſdom is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable, ſo his Power is Infinite, and his Happineſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variable and eternal. All Futurity is open to his all pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating Eye, and all Things poſſible are included within the Compaſs of his Almightineſs. <hi>He is of one Mind and who can turn him, and what his Soul deſireth even that he doeth.</hi> Job xxiii. 13. No change of Affairs can be produc'd beſides his Purpoſe or without the Interpoſition of his ſovereign Providence, and therefore he cannot be thereby neceſſitated to change his Purpoſe, or fall from his Declarations. And hence <hi>Philo</hi> well obſerves, <q>That all the Words of God are Oaths.</q> i. e. moſt ſacred and certain. And <hi>Fulgentius</hi> ſayeth truly concerning the ſupream Being, viz. <q>That he is Truth without Fallacy, Goodneſs without Malice, and Happineſs without Miſery.</q> 
               <hi>Pythagoras</hi> being ask'd what made Men like to God, anſwered, <hi>cum vera loquntur</hi> i. e. when they ſpeak Things that are true.</p>
            <p>In diſcourſing upon this Subject, I purpoſe to ſpeak
<list>
                  <item>I. Upon the <hi>Kinds</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> of divine <hi>Truth.</hi> And</item>
                  <item>II. To anſwer ſome <hi>Objections</hi> againſt it, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to ſome <hi>Improvement</hi> And</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. It may be obſerved, that Truth in its general Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, conſiſts in Agreement, and is Three-fold, <hi>viz.</hi> Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, Logical, and Moral. <hi>Phyſical Truth,</hi> conſiſts in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, which ſubſiſts between the Appearence of a Thing, and the Thing itſelf. This kind of Truth is by ſome term'd eſſential, and by others metaphyſical.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. <hi>Logical Truth</hi> is when we conceive of a Thing in our Minds, as it really is in it ſelf. As the Former is oppos'd to Paint, and all falſe Appearences, ſo this is oppos'd to Error and Miſtake in Judgement.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="368" facs="unknown:005500_0371_10396644F64F2ED8"/>3dly. <hi>Moral Truth</hi> conſiſts in ſpeaking as we think, this is oppos'd to lying, the Nature of which conſiſts in going againſt the Mind, according to the old and true Saying, <hi>mentire eſt contra mentem ire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now each of theſe Kinds of Truth, that I have mentioned belongs to God truly and tranſcendently: For</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. He has what appertains to true Godhead by his Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence without any Diſguiſe. <hi>John</hi> xvii. 3. <hi>This is eternal Life, to know thee the only tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> God, and JESUS CHRIST whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> Jehovah hath a real Subſiſtence, and gives Being to all Creatures; whereas the falſe Gods of the Heathen, have nothing divine, they only carry a deceitful Appearance, or obtain it in the Minds of their Worſhippers. <hi>They are only dumb Idols which have Eyes and ſee not, Ears and hear not, neither ſpeak they thro' their Threats! They are nothing but Vanity and a Lie, They that make them are like to them, and ſo is every one that truſteth in them</hi> Pſal. cxv. 5, 8. And</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. The Mind of God exactly agrees with the Nature of Things, becauſe he beholds all Things in himſelf. <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any Creature that is not manifeſt in his Sight, but all Things are naked and open unto the Eye of him, with whom we have to do.</hi> Heb. iv. 13.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. The Declarations of God's Word exactly agree with the Conceptions of his Mind, and Reſolutions of his Will, in all the Parts thereof whether Hiſtorical, Prophetical, Promiſory, Minatory, Perceptive. Hence the Word of God is ſaid <hi>to be pure, Pſ.</hi> cxix. 140. i. e. Its free from all Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Deceit and Falſhood. And hence it is likewiſe ſaid to be <hi>try'd,</hi> 2 Sam. xxii. 31. <hi>As for God his Way is perfect the Word of the Lord is try'd, he is a Buckler to all that truſt in him.</hi> Pſal xii. 6. <hi>The Words of the Lord are pure Words, as Silver try'd in a Furnace of Earth, purified ſeven-times.</hi> And</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. All the Works of God exactly agree with his Purpoſe
<pb n="369" facs="unknown:005500_0372_103966435175BDE8"/>
and Declaration, <hi>Deut.</hi> xxxii. 4. <hi>He is a Rock his Work is perfect for all his Ways are Judgment, a God of Truth and without Iniquity juſt and right is he.</hi> And hence the Almighty is ſaid to be <hi>faithful,</hi> 1ſt. In the Works of <hi>Creation,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> iv. 19. <hi>Wherefore let them that ſuffer according to the Will of God commit the keeping of their Souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.</hi> 2dly. In the Work of <hi>Redemption,</hi> Heb. ii. 17. <hi>Wherefore in all Things it behoved him to be made like unto his Brethren, that he might be a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful and faithful high Prieſt.</hi> 3dly. The Almighty is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the Works <hi>of Grace,</hi> and hence <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> are ſaid to come <hi>by JESUS CHRIST,</hi> John i. 17. 4thly. He is likewiſe faithful in the Works of <hi>Providence,</hi> more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the Preſervation of his Church, <hi>Rev.</hi> xix. 11. <hi>And I ſaw Heaven opened, and behold a white Horſe, and he that ſat on him was called faithful and true, and in Righteouſneſs he doth judge and make War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Univerſal Truth of God, that has been menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, entirely excludes, and is directly oppos'd to every Error in Judgment, as well as to all Falſhood, and lying in Speech and to all Hypocriſy and Deceit in Practice. And therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> juſtly obſerves, <hi>Prov.</hi> vi. 16, 17, 19. <hi>That ſix Things the Lord Hates, yea that ſeven are an Abomination unto him!</hi> Among which he names <hi>a lying Tongue, and a falſe Witneſs.</hi> Tit. i. 2 <hi>In hope of eternal Life which God that cannot lie promiſed before the World began.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in order to open the Nature of divine Truth more fully, I think it may be thus deſcribed, viz. <hi>That it is that Property of the divine nature whereby the Almighty conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and inviolably adheres to his eternal Purpoſe both in his Word and Works.</hi> When God is in Scripture call'd <hi>the true God, or the only true God;</hi> theſe Phraſes do not ſignify any diſtinct Perfection of the divine Nature, but the whole God-head, in Oppoſition to all that are call'd God's, but are not
<pb n="370" facs="unknown:005500_0373_103966414E4C89A8"/>
ſo by nature. But when he is call'd <hi>the God of Truth,</hi> as in our Text, it intends a particular Attribute or Perfection of Jehovah, even ſuch as has but now been deſcrib'd. Which Deſcription that it may be the better underſtood, let the following particulars be conſidered viz.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. That God hath from everlaſting purpoſed or deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to permit or effect whatſoever comes to paſs in Time. i. e. He has before all Time decred, to permit the Evil that is done in Time, without which it could not come to paſs, except we deny the Omnipotence of God, which is blaſphemous. And he has likewiſe purpos'd to effect the Good, which cannot be brought to paſs without his Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Influence. And hence we are told <hi>Acts</hi> xv. 18. <hi>That known unto God are all his Works from the Beginning of the World.</hi> This Fore-knowledge neceſſarily ſuppoſes his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for what is not certainly determin'd, cannot be certainly foreknown. But the Purpoſe of God, which is no other than an imanent or eternal Act of his Will, reſpecting his Works of Efficiency, is more expreſſly ſpoken of, <hi>Epheſ,</hi> i. 11. <hi>In whom alſo we have obtained an Inheritance being Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated according to the Purpoſe of him who works all Things after the Council of his own Will.</hi> And as the Purpoſe of God is eternal, in reſpect of its Riſe and Orignal, ſo it is abſolute and invariable in its Nature. The Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Things in the decree, are only therein conſider'd as Means determined to compaſs the End deſign'd, <hi>Prov.</hi> xix. 21. <hi>There are many Devices in Man's Heart, nevertheleſs the Council of the Lord that ſhall ſtand.</hi> Job xxiii. 13. <hi>But he is in one Mind, and who can turn him, and what his Soul deſireth even that he doeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly. God hath been pleas'd to reveal ſome Part of his eternal Purpoſe in his Word. I ſay ſome Part, becauſe there are ſecret Things which are known only to God.
<pb n="371" facs="unknown:005500_0374_1039663FA5D1DE98"/>
The Almighty has reveal'd as much of his Purpoſe in his Word, as his Wiſdom judged neceſſary for us to know.</p>
            <p>Now the Revelation we have of God's Purpoſe in his Word, appears eſpecially in theſe Things following, viz.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. In the Hyſtorical Part of it, that contains a true and juſt Relation of Matters of Fact, which have been brought to paſs exactly agreeable to the eternal Plan of the divine Purpoſe. And</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. In Propheſies of Things to come, many ſuch are contain'd in Scripture, both of a publick and perſonal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And how gloriouſly does the Truth of God ſhine forth in the punctual accompliſhment of many of them? Here I ſhall only mention a few, in Relation to our Lord CHRIST. <hi>Jacob</hi> propheſied of the Time of his Birth, viz. <hi>That it ſhould be after the Scepter was departed from Judah.</hi> Gen. xliv. 10. And thus it happened, for <hi>Herod</hi> who ſway'd the Scepter at that Time, was of an <hi>Idumean</hi> Extraction. The Prophet <hi>Micah.</hi> foretold, that the Place of his Birth ſhould be <hi>Bethlehem. Mica</hi> v. 2. <hi>But thou Bethlehem Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, out of thee ſhall come forth,—that is to be the Ruler in Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, whoſe Goings forth have been from of old, from Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> And thus it came to paſs. <hi>Mat.</hi> ii. 1. <hi>Now when JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the Days of</hi> Herod <hi>the King. Iſaiah</hi> propheſied that his Parent ſhould be a Virgin, <hi>Iſa.</hi> vii. 14. <hi>Behold a Virgin ſhall conceive and bear a Son, and ſhall call his Name Imanuel.</hi> And this the Event anſwered. (<hi>Mat.</hi> i.) <hi>Zachariah</hi> propheſied of the humble Circumſtances of his Life, in the ixth Chapt. of his Book, and the 9th Verſe. <hi>Rejoyce greatly O Daughter of Zion, ſhout O Daughter of Jeruſalem, behold thy King cometh unto thee, He is is juſt and having Salvation, lowly, and riding upon an Aſs, and upon a Colt the Foal of an Aſs!</hi> And do not the Evangeliſts aſſure us, that this was fulfilled to a Tittle? <hi>Iſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>
               <pb n="372" facs="unknown:005500_0375_1039663E216EE238"/>
graphically delineates his miraculous Works, <hi>Iſa.</hi> xxxv. 56. <hi>Then the Eyes of the blind ſhall be opened and the Ears of the Deaf ſhall be unſtopped, then ſhall the lame Man leap as a Hart, and the Tongue ſhall ſing.</hi> And theſe Things we are aſſur'd did come to paſs by all that Evidence of credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and harmonious Teſtimony, which the Nature of ſuch paſt Facts can admit of, and it is unreaſonable ſurely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire more! <hi>Daniel</hi> foretells his Death in the ixth Chap. of his Book, and 26th Verſe. <hi>The Meſſiah ſhall be cut off, but not for himſelf.</hi> And the Pſalmiſt <hi>David</hi> foretels the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it ſo particularly, as if he had ſtood at the Croſs and beheld it. <hi>Pſ.</hi> xxii 16,—19. <hi>The Aſſembly of the Wicked have inclos'd me, they pierced my Hands and my Feet. I may tell all my Bones, they look and ſtare upon me, they part my Garments among them, and caſt Lots upon my Veſture.</hi> And is not the Burial of our Lord in the Tomb of a rich Man ſpoken of by <hi>Iſaiah? Iſa.</hi> liii. 9. <hi>And he made his Grave with the Wicked, and with the Rich in his Death.</hi> Which was accordingly fulfilled. <hi>Mat.</hi> xvii. 59, 60. And does not the Pſalmiſt prophecy of his Reſurrection, of which <hi>Jonah</hi> was a Type? <hi>Pſ.</hi> lxviii. 18. <hi>Thou haſt aſcended on high, thou haſt led Captivity Captive, thou haſt received Gifts for Men.</hi> Of the accompliſhment of which, the Evangeliſt <hi>Luke</hi> informs us, (<hi>Luke.</hi> xxiv. 51.) But I proceed</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. The Almighty reveals his eternal Purpoſes in his Word, by Precepts; by theſe God ſhews to Man his Duty and the Way to obtain the divine Favour, in which his Happineſs conſiſts; and this the Almighty purpoſed to do from Eternity. And hence it is called the <hi>Council of God. Acts</hi> xx. 27.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. The Almighty likewiſe reveals his Purpoſe in his Word by Threatnings againſt his Enemies. Theſe are as fiery Barriers about his Law, to preſerve it from Contempt
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:005500_0376_1039663C99974CD0"/>
and Inſult! As his unſpotted Holineſs is delineated in the Precepts of his Law, ſo his dreadful Juſtice is diſplay'd in the Penalties annexed to the Breach thereof, which render Jehovah moſt juſtly an Object of Fear, as the Former of Love. Now the Threatnings of God's Word, are no other than a Revelation of thoſe Judgments, which God had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd from everlaſting to inflict, upon finally impenitent Tranſgreſſors <hi>Iſa.</hi> xxx. ult. <hi>For Tophet is ordain'd of old; for the King it is prepar'd, he hath made it deep and large, the Pile thereof is Fire and much Wood. The Breath of the Lord like a Stream of Brimſtone doth kindle it.</hi> And</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. God reveals his eternal Purpoſe in his Word, by Promiſes of Spiritual and Temporal good Things to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; which he ſincerely makes, and punctually performs; and on this Account, he is more eſpecially call'd, <hi>the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful God, who keepeth Covenant and Mercy with thoſe that love him and keep his Commandments, to a Thouſand Generations.</hi> Deut. vii. 9. As the Threatnings of God excite Fear, ſo his Promiſes encourage Truſt and Hope. Tho' God is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make us happy, yet we have no Ground to expect his Goodneſs except it be engag'd to us by Promiſe: For the Almighty is under no natural Obligation, to magnify his Mercy upon us. But when he is pleas'd to engage his Truth in our Favour by promiſe, it renders the Bleſſings promiſed moſt certain; and ſo miniſters ſtrong Conſolation to all that fear God, ſo that they may reaſonably rejoyce in Hope of eternal Life, whatever Difficulties, and threatning Appearances ſeem to obſtruct their attainment of it. Now the Promiſes of God either reſpect Mankind in general, or the Church in particular, or truly pious Perſons in ſpecial. Some Benefits promis'd to Mankind in general are theſe, viz. That the World ſhall be preſerved to the ſecond coming of our Lord, from another Deluge by Water, the Sign of which
<pb n="374" facs="unknown:005500_0377_1039663A3AFEA940"/>
is God's Bow in the Clouds. And likewiſe that the ſtated and regular Courſe of Nature, in reſpect of Seed Time, and Harveſt, Cold and Heat, Summer and Winter, Day and Night ſhall not ceaſe. (<hi>Gen.</hi> ix. 11.) The Promiſes made to the Church, reſpect its Protection, Increaſe, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Preſence, in their Religious Aſſemblies. Thus the Almighty hath ſaid, <hi>that no Weapon form'd againſt Zion ſhall proſper, and that the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt her.</hi> He hath alſo promiſed, <hi>that to Shiloh or the Meſias ſhould be the gathering of the People.</hi> i. e. the Gentiles. <hi>Gen.</hi> xlix. 10. And <hi>that he would multiply them and they ſhould not be ſmall,</hi> Jer. xxx. 19. And Jehovah has promis'd, <hi>that in all Places where he records his Name, he will come to his People and bleſs them,</hi> Ex. xx. 24. The Almighty has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo made gracious Promiſes, ſuited to all the various Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies of his People in particular, e. g. He has promiſed to <hi>guide them with his Eye and by his Council, to ſupport them by his Power and to refreſh them by his Love,</hi> Pſ. xxxii. 8. Iſ. xli. 10. <hi>Fear thou not for I am with thee, be not diſmay'd for I am thy God, I will ſtrengthen thee, yea I will help thee, yea I will uphold thee by the right Hand of my Righteouſneſs.</hi> Iſ. lvii. 19. <hi>I create the Fruit of the Lips, Peace, Peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near ſayeth, the Lord and I will heal him.</hi> Moreover God has promiſed, <hi>that thoſe who wait upon him ſhall renew their Strength,</hi> Pſ. lxxxiv. 7. Iſa. xl. 31. and finally, <hi>obtain eternal Life.</hi> John x. 28. <hi>I give unto them eternal Life, and they ſhall never periſh.</hi> Now every one of theſe Promiſes has been fulfilled, the World has been freed from a ſecond Deluge, the ſucceſſive Viciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of the Year are continued, the Church preſerved and propagated, and particular Believers directed, ſupported and reliev'd. This leads me to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="375" facs="unknown:005500_0378_10396638B5B636B0"/>3d. Particular, which is this, <hi>viz.</hi> God's adhering to his Purpoſe, reveal'd in his Word by his Works. I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready obſerv'd, that God hath determined all Things from Eternity, and that he hath revealed this Purpoſe or Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination in his Word, <hi>various Ways:</hi> I am now to ſhew that God performs by his Works what he hath declared in his Word: As there is a Truth which conſiſts in a Conformity between the <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Tongue,</hi> which is call'd <hi>Sincerity:</hi> ſo their is a Truth which conſiſts in an Agreement between <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Deeds,</hi> which is call'd <hi>Fidelity</hi> or <hi>Faithfulneſs.</hi> The Almighty not only Purpoſes to do what he declares, but he adheres to and purſues his Declaration with invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable Conſtancy. He does all Things that he hath ſpoken, and exactly as he hath ſpoken: He does not in the leaſt come ſhort of his Word in his Works. Numb. xxiii. 19. <hi>God is not a Man that he ſhould lye, or the Son of Man that he ſhould repent: Hath he ſaid, and ſhall he not do it? Hath he ſpoken, and ſhall he not make it Good?</hi> How expreſs and Noble is the Teſtimony of <hi>Moſes</hi> upon this Head? 1 King viii. 56. <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord that he hath given reſt unto his People</hi> Iſrael, <hi>according to all that he hath promiſed, there hath not fail'd one Word of all his good Promiſe which he promis'd by the Hand of</hi> Moſes <hi>his Servant.</hi> I have already ſhewn how exactly the divine Propheſies and Promiſes have been fulfilled: And I may here add, that <hi>Jehovah</hi> has often manifeſted and magnified his Truth in the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Threatnings. And hence he is ſaid <hi>to be known, i. e.</hi> In the Glory of his Truth and Juſtice, <hi>by the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which he executes.</hi> All the Inſtances of divine Judgment upon the old World, <hi>Sodom, Gomorha, Zeboim, and Adma,</hi> and upon the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> which we have upon Record in Scripture, are ſo many Confirmations of the Truth of God. I proceed to the</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="376" facs="unknown:005500_0379_1039663718D2DBC0"/>2d. Propos'd, which was to anſwer ſome Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Truth of God. And</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. It is objected that CHRIST is ſaid <hi>to die for the whole World. (Joh.</hi> i. 29.) How doth this conſiſt with the Truth of God, ſeeing that elſewhere, (<hi>viz. Rom.</hi> ix. 22.) It is ſaid that <hi>ſome are Veſſels of Wrath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Word <hi>World,</hi> is taken either in a limited Senſe, for the World of the Elect. Thus CHRIST is ſaid <hi>to take away the Sin of the World,</hi> John i. 29. Or in a more large Senſe, for both Elect and Reprobates. And thus 2dly. it may be obſerv'd, that CHRIST dyed ſufficiently for all, but not intentionally and effectually, <hi>i. e.</hi> The Value of Chriſts Blood was enough for all, but its Vertue was only deſign'd for, and is only apply'd to thoſe that believe. Hence God is ſaid <hi>to be the Saviour of all Men, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of thoſe that believe.</hi> A</p>
            <p n="2">2d. Object. is, that tho' God threatned our firſt Parents that in the Day they eat of the forbidden Fruit they ſhould ſurely dye; yet this threatning was not executed, for <hi>Adam</hi> lived after this nine Hundred and thirty Years.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> They did die the ſame Day in ſeveral Reſpects, <hi>viz.</hi> 1ſt. <hi>Legally,</hi> they were dead in Law, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd by the Law they broke, to a temporal and eternal Death: And this in a forenſick Senſe is often call'd <hi>Death (See Rom.</hi> viii. 10.) <hi>The Body is dead becauſe of Sin, i. e.</hi> It is expos'd to Death, as a Conſequence of Sin, by Reaſon of the Sentence of the Law againſt Tranſgreſſor not that it is actually dead. And 2dly our firſt Parent died <hi>Spiritually</hi> the ſame Day: They immediately loſt the divine Image, and that Bleſſed Conſequence of it, Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God. And hence they are ſaid <hi>to come ſhort of his Glory, Rom.</hi> iii. 23. And they may be ſaid to die <hi>naturally</hi> the ſame Day, in ſome Senſe <hi>viz.</hi> Not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="377" facs="unknown:005500_0380_1039663576C0A9A0"/>
they were under a Neceſſity of enduring, in after Times, the Separation of the Soul from the Body, by Vertue of the Sentence of the Law before mentioned, but alſo becauſe, in all probability, the original craſis and juſt temperature of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours in their Bodies being broke, there was a direct tendency in this judicial Diſorder of their very Frame, to a Diſſolution. A</p>
            <p n="3">3d. Object. is, That tho' <hi>Niniveh</hi> was threatned to be deſtroy'd in forty Days; yet the Threatning was not executed till forty Years after.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Poſſibly forty prophetical Days, which are Years, were intended, tho' <hi>Jonah</hi> underſtood it not, and if ſo the Propheſy was exactly fulfill'd: But in my Opinion the following Anſwer is more ſatisfactory, <hi>viz.</hi> That there was a Condition imply'd in, and annex'd to the Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which was intended to be publiſhed to the <hi>Ninivites;</hi> namely, that they ſhould be deſtroy'd in forty Days, if they did not repent. It appears by the <hi>Ninivites</hi> humbling themſelves that they underſtood the Prophet in this Senſe. For if the Threatning had been abſolute, the Uſe of Means would have been to no purpoſe, either by the People or the Prophet: But we ſee that both did uſe Means, he preach'd, and they humbled themſelves, and therefore there was certainly a Condition annex'd to the Threatning: And thus the Objection evaniſhes.</p>
            <p>Object. 4. The <hi>Pelagians, Papiſts, Socinians, Arminians, Remonſtrants</hi> and <hi>Lutherans</hi> ſay, that the Doctrine of the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> reſpecting the Decrees, argues God to be Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true and Inſincere; becauſe while they Teach, that God wills the Salvation of all, that yet notwithſtanding, he in in the mean Time wills and decrees the Damnation of ſome: And that tho' God offers the Redeemer to every one, and invites them by many Arguments to accept him; yet that he in the mean Time does not will that they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and repent, and be ſav'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="378" facs="unknown:005500_0381_10396633AEBC5EE8"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The <hi>Calviniſt</hi>'s on the Contrary do ſolemnly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt in the Preſence of God, that they believe God to be True in every Thing, and that his Words do anſwer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly to, or agree with both the Things ſpoken of, and his own Mind, and therefore that God always wills what he ſays he wills; but after that Manner that he wills, <hi>i. e.</hi> If he declares that he wills an <hi>Event,</hi> then that Event moſt certainly comes to Paſs. If he declares that he wills that this or that ſhould be our <hi>Duty, i. e.</hi> That we ſhould do or omit this or that, then it certainly is our <hi>Duty,</hi> whether it be perform'd or not: To this Purpoſe they diſtinguiſh the Will of God into <hi>Legiſlative</hi> and <hi>Decretive;</hi> the former they ſay is that whereby he determines and wills only concerning Right and Rule, <hi>viz.</hi> What we ought to do or omit; but determines nothing concerning the Event: The latter is that whereby God wills and determines concerning the Event which ſhall be; but does not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern Right and Rule reſpecting what ſhould be. Upon this Account they aſſert, that God wills many Things by his Legiſlative Will which do not come to paſs, <hi>e. g.</hi> Thus he will'd that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> according to Right, ſhould let the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> go, <hi>i. e.</hi> He will'd that to be <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roh</hi>'s <hi>Duty;</hi> but this he did not will decretively or according to Fact, or in Reſpect of the Event; for if ſo the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty's Purpoſe was fruſtrate in that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did not let them go at the firſt Demand; but this is impoſſible, the Council of God ſhall ſtand. Now from what has been ſaid the following <hi>Anſwer</hi> may be given to the Objection. <hi>viz.</hi> 1ſt. That God does not will the Death of a Sinner by a legiſlative Will, in as much as he really wills that there ſhould be a Connection between the Converſion of the Sinner and his Salvation, and therefore he ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly invites every one to Converſion: And to ſuch as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted he promiſes Life; tho he does not in the mean Time
<pb n="379" facs="unknown:005500_0382_10396631DEFA5BE0"/>
will decretively to give to all Grace and Salvation. 2dly. The <hi>Calviniſts</hi> acknowledge that God wills all to be ſav'd in the Senſe of <hi>Auſtin;</hi> who by the Word <hi>All,</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood ſome of all Sorts, not every Individual: As in the Ark God is ſaid <hi>to ſave all the living Creatures;</hi> but every Bird and Beaſt was not ſav'd, for many periſh'd in the Waters: But <hi>All,</hi> that is, ſome of every Kind, were ſav'd; ſo God will have all to be ſav'd, that is ſome of all Nations. The Almighty wills Faith and Repentance to be the Duty of All and Singular, but he does not will decretively the Salvation of All and Singular, for then they would be ſav'd: But the Scriptures aſſure us, that but a few are ſav'd. Salvation is offer'd according to the <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> Syſtem, only to thoſe that believe and repent, and to them it is given; and where then is the Inſincerity? If they reply and ſay, that ſuch are invited to come to CHRIST, according to our Doctrine, who are decreed to Deſtruction?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> What then? ſeeing the Decree does not force or influence the Will. Are not ſuch invited to come to CHRIST according to their Scheme, whom God foreknows ſhall Periſh? Does not certain Fore-knowledge fix the Event as much as the Decree? Let them remove this Difficulty which croſſes their own Scheme, and they will anſwer their own Objection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 5. Some Promiſes made to the People of God, reſpecting temporal and ſpiritual Bleſſings, are not perform'd; namely, ſuch as reſpect Growth in Grace, Comfort, Victory over Temptation, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Lord may ſometimes delay the Performance of a Promiſe, but he will not deny. God's Promiſe may lye a long Time, as Seed under Ground, but at laſt it will ſpring up. The Viſion is for an appointed Time, tho' it taries, wait for it, it will come it will nottary i. e. beyond God's appointed Time. God promiſed to deliver Iſrael from the
<pb n="380" facs="unknown:005500_0383_103966305D0736A0"/>
Egyptian Bondage, but this Promiſe was Four Hundred Years in Travail, before it brought forth the determin'd Event. God promiſed to <hi>Abraham</hi> a numerous Offspring, but Twenty Years elapſed before he had a Son, and then was commanded to ſlay him. How dark and dreadful was this Providence! But notwithſtanding of the Delays and contrary Appearances, the Promiſe was accompliſh'd in its appointed Seaſon!</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. God may change his Promiſe, but he will not break it: He may turn a Temporal Promiſe into a Spiritual. <hi>Pſ.</hi> lxxxv. 12. <hi>The Lord ſhall give that which is good.</hi> Tho' this be not fulfill'd in a Temporal, yet if it be in a Spiritual Senſe, the Promiſe is made good, yea the Almighty may be ſaid to be herein better than his Word, when he gives that which is greater in Worth, tho' not the ſame in Kind, which was expected.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. There are no Promiſes of God, but what are made good in Kind in ſome Inſtances. And this is a manifeſt Vindication of the divine Truth therein engag'd, ſeeing the Benefits promiſed are conferred on ſome. And</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. God never promiſes any Benefits in ſuch a Manner as to infringe upon the Rights of his Sovereignty. No, all Bleſſings are promis'd with this Reſerve, viz. That if God thinks it neceſſary for his Glory and their Good, he will compaſs their Salvation another Way. The Almighty by ſpiritual Deſertions and Temptations, doth try the Faith and Patience of his People, as well as humble them, and make them prize CHRIST and his Comforts the more afterwards. And thus theſe Things, yea and their very Blunders are (contrary to their natural Tendency) over rul'd for their Good; which is more than an equivalent for the Loſs of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Joy and Comfort for a Time. And therefore there is hereby no Occaſion given to reflect upon the Truth and Faithfulneſs of God. But</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="381" facs="unknown:005500_0384_1039662E9D513BD8"/>5thly. All the Promiſes of God ſhall be accompliſhed in the next World to the greateſt Advantage. The Joys of that glorious Paradiſe, will ſufficiently compenſate our preſent momentary and medicinal Sorrows and Miſeries. But it's Time to proceed to the Improvement of this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. And</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. We may learn from what has been ſaid, the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and dreadful Caſe of all impenitent Sinners in general, and more particularly of ſuch, who are guilty (habitually) of Lying, Falſhood, Equivocation, and Deceit of any Kind. As they hereby directly oppoſe the Nature and Law of the God of Truth, as well as contradict the Genius of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who are Children that will not lie; ſo they verge to the Temper of the Devil, the ſworn Enemy of God, who was a Lyar and a Murderer from the Beginning, and abode not in the Truth, who is a Lyar and the Father of it. All ſuch do exclude themſelves from Communion with God, in this Life, and the Enjoyment of him in the next; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote themſelves to a dreadful and interminable Deſtruction, <hi>Rev.</hi> ii. 1, 27. <hi>And there ſhall in no wiſe enter into it, any Thing that defileth, neither whatſoever worketh Abomination, or maketh a Lye.</hi> Pſ. v. 6. <hi>Thou ſhalt deſtroy them that ſpeak leaſing, the Lord will abhor the bloody and deceitful Man.</hi> God is a God of Truth, and therefore will execute his Threatnings upon the whole Tribe of Impenitents. The Threatnings are a flying <hi>Roll</hi> againſt Tranſgreſſors, in which is written nothing but Mourning, Lamentation and Woe. Jehovah hath ſaid, <hi>That he will wound the hairy Scalp, of every one that goeth on ſtill in his Treſpaſſes,</hi> Pſ. lxviii. 21. <hi>That he will judge Adulterers: That he beholds Miſchief and Spite, to requite it with his Hand,</hi> Heb. xiii. 3. Pſ. x. 14. <hi>That he will rain upon the Wicked Snares, Fire and Brimſtone, and an horrible Tempeſt, &amp; that this ſhall be the Portion of their Cup,</hi> Pſ. xi. 6. And he will ſurely be as good as his Word.
<pb n="382" facs="unknown:005500_0385_1039662D189F5840"/>
               <hi>The Heavens and Earth may paſs away,</hi> but not a Word that God hath ſpoken, ſhall paſs without its accompliſhment. Let not therefore unconverted Sinners preſume or harden themſelves in their Impieties, becauſe <hi>Judgment is not ſpeedily executed,</hi> for Delays are no Payment. Let them not vainly conclude, <hi>that the Bitterneſs of Death is paſt,</hi> becauſe their Houſes are ſafe from Fear, neither is the Rod of God upon them. Notwithſtanding of all this, they may aſſure themſelves <hi>that the Wicked are reſerved for the Day of Deſtruction, they ſhall be brought forth to the Day of Wrath,</hi> Job xxi. 9.30. Let any who expect Impunity in a Courſe of Rebellion againſt the great God, ſeriouſly and ſpeedily conſider that dreadful Threatning. <hi>Deut.</hi> xxix. 19.20. <hi>And it cometh to paſs, when he heareth the Words of this Curſe, that he bleſs himſelf in his Heart, ſaying, I ſhall have Peace, tho' I walk in the Imagination of mine Heart, to add Drunkenneſs to Thirſt. The Lord will not ſpare him, but then the Anger of the Lord and his Jealouſie ſhall ſmoke againſt that Man, and all the Curſes that are written in this Book ſhall ly upon him and the Lord ſhall blot out his Name from under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> I ſhall only mention one other Scripture, under this Uſe, and it is <hi>Pſ.</hi> l. 20, 21, 22. <hi>Thou ſitteſt and ſpeakeſt againſt thy Brother, thou ſlandereſt thine own Mother's Son, theſe Things haſt thou done, and I kept Silence, thou thought'ſt that I was altogether ſuch an one as thy ſelf, but I will reprove thee, and ſet them in order before thine Eyes. Now conſider this ye that forget God, leaſt I tear you in Pieces, when there ſhall be none to deliver.</hi> But</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. The Truth of God ſpeaks much Comfort to his People under all their Troubles. What tho' Jehovah hides his Face, yet let not Believers deſpond: For he will ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>return with everlaſting Loving-kindneſs.</hi> His Faithfulneſs cannot fail, <hi>he will ever be mindful of his Covenant.</hi> Pſ. cxi. 5. The gracious God hath made many precious Promiſes
<pb n="383" facs="unknown:005500_0386_1039662B35F82598"/>
of important Benefits, ſuited to all the various Difficulties which his People labour under in this Life, ſome of which have been already mentioned in this Sermon, every of which his Truth ſtands engaged to ſecure. 1 <hi>Theſ</hi> v. 24. <hi>Faithful is he that calleth you, who alſo will do it.</hi> Heb. vi. 18. <hi>That by two immutable Things, in which it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for God to lie, we might have ſtrong Conſolation, who have fled for Refuge, to lay hold on the Hope ſet before us,</hi> 1 Sam. xvi. 25. <hi>And alſo the Strength of Iſrael will not lie or repent, for he is not a Man that he ſhould repent.</hi> And hence the <hi>Gifts of God</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>without Repentance,</hi> and his Mercies are called, <hi>the ſure mercies of David.</hi> (Rom. xi. 29. Acts xiii. 24. 2 Sam. xxiii. 5.) <hi>Altho' my Houſe be not ſo with God, yet he hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant, ordered in all Things, and ſure.</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>Tho' I fail much in that Purity God requires, yet this is my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that God hath made an everlaſting Covenant with me.</hi> Let us therefore be exhorted to the following Duties, namely,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Let us truſt in God, and expect from him the Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filment of all his Promiſes to the Church in general, and to ourſelves in particular, (if we be his) what tho' Clouds and Darkneſs cover her Horizon, yet the faithful God has promiſed <hi>to be the Glory and Defence of Zion, and to make her a Praiſe in the Earth.</hi> And what tho' ourſelves are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with, and ſometimes led captive by our Corruptions God has promiſed, <hi>to ſubdue our Iniquities,</hi> Mic. vii. 19. And ſurely the Truth of God in his Promiſes is a ſufficient Foundation for our Faith. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 13. <hi>If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful, he cannot deny himſelf. He is abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant in Truth,</hi> Ex. xxxiv. 6. That is, he is ſo far from coming ſhort of his Word, that he will be better than his Word. <q>We are not, ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> to belive our Senſes ſo much as we are to believe the Promiſes, for they may fail us, but the Promiſes cannot, being built
<pb n="384" facs="unknown:005500_0387_10396629974342E0"/>
upon the Truth of God.</q> And ſurely he that believeth not, has made God a Lyar: i e. He implicitly charges ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the God of Truth. 1 <hi>John</hi> v. 10.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. Let us <hi>commit ourſelves to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator,</hi> 1 Pet. iv. 19. Or as our Text expreſſes it, <hi>Let us commit our Spirit into his Hand, for he has redeemed us.</hi> What tho' we be encompaſſed with Diſtreſſes, let us truſt, <hi>that he who hath delivered, and doth deliver, that he will deliver us,</hi> 2 Cor. i. 10. <hi>That he who hath begun a good Work in us, will perform it, untill the Day of</hi> JESUS CHRIST, Phil. i. 6. Let us avoiding all diſtreſſing Anxiety about fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Events, calmly and firmly reſt upon the Promiſes of a faithful God. And finally let us imitate the God of Truth, in Speech and Practice, hereby we ſhall be conform'd to the God of Truth, and evidence our being living Members of the Church militant, <hi>which is the Pillar and Ground of Truth.</hi> 1. Tim. iii. 15. As well as the certainty of our being at laſt admitted into the Church Triumphant. (Pſa. xv.) It is for a Lamentation that many who profeſs Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, fall ſhort of <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> in reſpect of Truth and Fidelity, and ſo give Ground for this doleful Diſtick.—
<q>
                  <l>Multis annis jam peractis, nulla fides eſt in pactis.</l>
                  <l>Mel in ore, verba lactis, fel in Corde, fraus in factis.</l>
               </q>
Which may be thus Engliſh'd.</p>

            </q>
            <p>And ſurely there is nothing more diſhonourable to God, and detrimental to the Intereſts of Religion, than ſuch Practices; therefore let every one that nameth the Name of God depart from them.</p>

            <p>THIS Book of <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> contains a Repetition of much of the Hiſtory and Laws which were men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the three preceeding Books, and therefore the <hi>Greek</hi> Interpreters, have juſtly given it the Name <hi>Deuteronomy;</hi> which ſignifies the ſecond Law, or the ſecond Edition of the Law. This Repetition <hi>Moſes</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered a little before his Death, not only by Writing, that it might be the better preſerv'd as a continual Memorial and Director in all Time coming, but alſo by Word of Mouth, that it might have the greater Influence upon the People's Affections for the Preſent. The Men of that Generation, to whom the Law was firſt given, were all Dead, and a new Generation being ſprung up in their Place, it was neceſſary that it ſhould be repeated to them by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and eſpecially a little before his Departure from them, that it might make the deeper Impreſſion on them, and as they were juſt going to take Poſſeſſion of the promis'd <hi>Canaan,</hi> it was but neceſſary they ſhould be told upon what Terms they might expect to hold and enjoy that Land. To this End <hi>Moſes</hi> tells them what they were to believe and do, and among other Things of principal Importance he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends to their Attention, Aſſent and Conſideration,

Altho' the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> by the Light of Nature, have been led to acknowledge, that the proper Object of Worſhip muſt be a God; yet how ſtrangely have they been miſtaken, confus'd and divided in their Choice of him, by their vain Imaginations?

to after Death, viz. As the Reward of Vertue, or in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of the Good, that they had done to the World in their Life, either by the Invention of profitable Arts, Succeſſes in Wars, or ſome other kind of Service to their Country. It is true, among the Romans, ſome had the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of an <hi>Apotheoſis</hi> or being reckon'd among the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Gods, at the Requeſt of their ſurviving Friends. And this was done after the Time of <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> by the Decree of the Senate, who at the ſame Time likewiſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the Rites of Worſhip that ſhould be paid to them. And indeed ſome of the Emperors of Rome were carried to that pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch of Vanity and Arogance, that they obliged the Senate to deify them while they were alive. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> diſcovers his Belief of one ſupream Deity, by ſeveral Paſſages in divers Parts of his Works, to the following Effect.</p>
            <p>He aſſerts, <q>That there is a God, who is the firſt Cauſe or Beginning of all Things, and that he was from Eternity, or in the Beginning, and that Time took its Riſe from him, and that he is the Fountain of Life, and the beſt of Beings. That he is Self-ſufficient, the chief Good, and ſtands in no need of, or can receive any Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from any, and that by him all Things conſiſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Several of the Gentile Philoſophers diſcover their Belief of the divine Unity, by aſſerting, <q>That there was one ſupream God, ſuperior to all others, whom they call the Father of the God's and of Men. Him they call the Beginning, the End, and Author of all Things, who was before, and is above all Things.</q> 
               <hi>Morneus,</hi> brings Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this Kind, from the Writings of <hi>Plotinus, Proclus, Phorphery, Plutarch</hi> and others; from all which it appears that the wiſer Sort among the Pagans, acknowledged the Unity of the ſupream Being. And therefore that what they ſpoke or did in Oppoſition hereto, was only from a ſordid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
<pb n="391" facs="unknown:005500_0394_1039661D13B4B168"/>
with the prevailing Cuſtom of their reſpective Countries, to prevent Aſperſions on their Characters, or Danger to their Perſons. It is probable that they paid only an inferior Kind of religious Worſhip to their Gods, like to what the Papiſts give to their Saints. It is true, herein they were Idolaters; but this they were induced to, in order to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape popular Odium. I am not here labouring to extenuate the Pagan Idolatrys; but only to prove that a Number of the more Judicious of them, were led by the Light of natural Reaſon to acknowledge the Unity of God.</p>
            <p>Now that natural Reaſon demonſtrates this fundamental Article of Religion, namely, the divine <hi>Unity,</hi> will more fully appear, by the following Conſiderations, viz.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Reaſon teaches us, that in the Subordination of Things, which we behold in the World, we muſt proceed to ſome firſt Cauſe, which is of it ſelf, and abſolutely the firſt, before which Nothing could exiſt, and with which Nothing could exiſt of the ſame Nature: For then it would not be firſt. All Number begins in a Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to ſay there are two firſt Beings, is a Contradiction in the very Nature of Things. The Multitude of ſecond Beings proves that that there is a firſt Being, otherwiſe they could not exiſt: For they can't give Being to themſelves: Where there is no firſt, there is no Order, and where there is no Order, there is no Goodneſs, except Confuſion be ſo called, which is abſur'd; and where there is no Goodneſs, there is nothing: For <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> are convertible Terms. Now that Being which is firſt is chief in reſpect of Dignity, and therefore he only is God, for Equality and Priority, are inconſiſtent to the ſame Subject. The very Idea of a God, implies a Supremacy in all poſſible Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency.</p>
            <p>That there is but one Being, who is without Beginning, and gave Being to all others, appears thus. If there were
<pb n="392" facs="unknown:005500_0395_1039661B917B9600"/>
more Gods, they muſt derive their Being from him, and then they are a Part of his Creation, and conſequently not Gods: For God and the Creature are infinitely oppos'd to each other. Well then ſeeing there is but one Self-exiſting independent Being, there can be but one God.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. Reaſon proclaims that God is infinite in all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and that becauſe he is not limitted by a prior Cauſe, he muſt therefore poſſes all Being and Goodneſs, either formally or eminently. Now the very Idea of God's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity not only ſpeaks his own Perfection to be boundleſs, but likewiſe that he bounds and limits the Perfections of all others. And thus being limitted they cannot be infinite and ſo the Poſſeſſors thereof cannot be God.</p>
            <p>And as infinite Perfection implies in it all Perfection, ſo it cannot be divided among many, for then the Parts would be leſs than the whole, and ſo not infinite: Upon this Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition there would be no God at all, becauſe infinite Excellency is neceſſarily implied in the Idea of a God.</p>
            <p>There is but one infinite Being and therefore but one God. <hi>Jer.</hi> xxiii. 24. <hi>Do not I fill Heaven and Earth ſayeth the Lord.</hi> If there be one infinite Being filling all Places at once, how can there be any Room for another Infinite to ſubſiſt?</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. Reaſon demonſtrates, that the firſt Being is. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty in Power, and therefore there is no other God, that can hinder or withſtand his Operations. If they can, then he is not Omnipotent, and ſo not God? If they cannot then they are not Omnipotent and ſo not God? If there were two Omnipotents, then we may reaſonably ſuppoſe that there would be a conteſt between them, that which one would do, the other Power being equal, would oppoſe, and ſo all Things would be brought into Confuſion. But that conſtant and uniform Order which we behold in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the World, is a ſufficient Confutation of this,
<pb n="393" facs="unknown:005500_0396_10396619AEAE5140"/>
and Proof of the contrary, viz. That there is but one God. If there were more God's than one, all of them muſt be ſaid to be able to do all Things, and then the ſame indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Power which is exerted by one muſt be exerted by all, which is abſurd and in the Nature of Things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. Reaſon likewiſe teaches, that if there be more Gods than one, then either they muſt be all equal to one another or unequal, if equal then none of them can be the chief Good, becauſe another is as good as he, and ſo none of them can be God; becauſe to be the chief Good is an eſſential Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of God, which is by this ſuppos'd equality deſtroy'd. If they are unequal then the Inferior cannot be God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is imperfect and dependant. Supremacy is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs an unalianable Prerogative of God, he is over all God bleſſed forever.</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. Abſolute Sovereignty, and univerſal Dominion are eſſential to a God, he being the Author and Original of all other Beings, has by conſequence a Right to give Laws to all, but is ſubject to no controle himſelf, becauſe he is Self-exiſtent and independent. Now if there were more God's than one, then every one could not have abſolute Sovereignty and univerſal Dominion: They might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and forbid oppoſite Things, and ſo controle the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of each other. The ſame Thing might therefore become both Sin and Duty, in reſpect of the Subjects, becauſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by one and forbid by the other, and thus there could be no certain Rule of Right, every Thing would be confus'd.</p>
            <p n="6">6thly. We may farther obſerve, that all the divine At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes prove God to be one. If none be God but he that hath all thoſe Attributes which Scripture and Reaſon aſſign to God, then there can be but one. Altho' there be ſome
<pb n="394" facs="unknown:005500_0397_103966180D2AD1B0"/>
faint Emblem of ſome of God's Attributes in Creatures, as particularly of his Holineſs and Goodneſs, &amp;c. yet Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have them not abſolutely or in the higheſt Degree, they may be Good, Holy, but cannot be Holineſs and Goodneſs; and thus the Attributes which are call'd communicable, can in their own Nature, properly and abſolutely, belong but to one. And as to God's incommunicable Attributes, ſuch as his immenſity, &amp;c. it is impoſſible they ſhould be mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply'd, if there be two Immenſity's, they muſt neceſſarily confine each other, and ſo neither be immenſe. Once more</p>
            <p n="7">7thly. Seeing that God is the Creator of all, it is but juſt and right that he ſhould be the End of all, of him and thro' him, and therefore to him are all Things. As the firſt Being muſt needs be the Beſt, and in this Senſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be the laſt End of all, ſo he has a juſt Claim of Right to it, having produced all by his Power, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and ſupported all by his Goodneſs; and therefore the Creature is under a natural and indiſpenſable Obligation to pay this Debt of Homage to his Creator, Preſerver and Benefactor, namely, to love him with ſupream Reſpect and to make his Glory his laſt End in all his Actions, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Natural, Civil or Religious, all which is utterly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with a multiplicity of Gods: For we can give our higheſt Love but to one, and make his Honour our higheſt Mark, which is the Natural Reſult of the Former.</p>
            <p>In the mean Time it ought to be maintain'd, that theſe Things following do not oppoſe the Unity of God, viz.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. A plurality of <hi>Names,</hi> ſeeing they ſignify no more but one God. Nor</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. A plurality of <hi>Attributes,</hi> ſeeing they do but repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the infinite Perfection of the divine Nature, which is but one in it ſelf, in a Way accommodated to our weak and inadequate Conceptions, Nor</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="395" facs="unknown:005500_0398_103966165D596D80"/>3dly. A Trinity of Perſons, ſeeing that among the three Perſons there is but one Eſſence, and three Modes of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting; from which Reſults not three Gods, but <hi>Three,</hi> who are one God. This leads me to the</p>
            <p n="2">2d. Propos'd, which was to explain the <hi>Nature of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Oneneſs.</hi> And here it may be obſerv'd that the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty is one.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Not by a <hi>Unity</hi> of <hi>Subject</hi> and <hi>Accident,</hi> namely ſuch as belongs to all created Spirits, Angels and the Souls of Men. Nor</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. By a <hi>Unity</hi> of <hi>compounded Parts,</hi> in which Senſe the Soul and Body conſtitute one Man. Nor</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. By a <hi>Unity</hi> of <hi>Species,</hi> which admits more Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals of the ſame Name and Nature.</p>
            <p>But poſſitively God is one by a <hi>ſingular Unity</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> which excludes all <hi>Compoſition</hi> of every Kind: He is ſo one as to be undivided in himſelf, and indiviſible into more of the ſame Name and Nature, and therefore the Unity of God is not an <hi>Arithmetical Unity</hi> which is the Beginning of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but it is an <hi>eſſential</hi> and <hi>tranſcendent Unity,</hi> whereby God is one in his Nature: And hence <hi>Baſil</hi> ſayeth truly, <q>Non unum inquit Deum numero ſed Natura confitemur. i. e. We confeſs not a God one in Number, but in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</q> And undoubtedly Oneneſs is aſcrib'd to God, in Oppoſition to the falſe God's of the <hi>Pagans,</hi> as has been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obſerv'd, as well as in Contradiſtinction to all titular God's.</p>
            <p>King's are call'd God's, becauſe their Royal Scepter is an Emblem of his Power and Authority; and Judges are likewiſe ſo call'd, becauſe they are ſet in God's Place to do Juſtice; but they are dying God's. Pſa. lxxxii. 5.7. <hi>I ſaid ye are Gods; but ye ſhall dye like Men.</hi> I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is in this Senſe that the Apoſtle obſerves, that <hi>there are God's many and
<pb n="396" facs="unknown:005500_0399_1039673A1DE83060"/>
Lord's many;</hi> but to us ſayeth he, <hi>there is but one Lord.</hi> 1 Cor. viii. 5.6. But that the Unity of the divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may be the better apprehended, let it be farther ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. That the various Perfections of the Deity are not in him, as ſo many Ingredients which conſtitute his Being to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; for then each would have but a partial Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and there would be ſomething in God leſs than God, which is abſurd. Nor,</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. Are the divine Perfections different from each other in him, as the Parts and Properties of Creatures are, <hi>e. g.</hi> Wiſdom in Men is realy different from Juſtice. But the ſupream Being hath no Parts, and his Perfections are not ſo diſtinguiſh'd as the qualities of Creatures; for if ſo, there would be as many diſtinct infinite Beings in God, as there are Attributes. Nor</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. Are any of the divine Perfections accidental to him. No, they are all his very Being. That is ſaid to be acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, which a Subſtance can ſubſiſt without. But to ſuppoſe the Almighty bereav'd of any one of his Attributes, is to ſuppoſe him Imperfect, and ſo no God. Therefore</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. The divine Perfections are repreſented as many and diſtinct, becauſe of the different Objects which the divine Perfection fixes upon, and the different <hi>Effects</hi> it produces in Creatures, as well as in condeſcention to their weak and finite Minds, which can conceive of the divine Nature, but as it were by Parts. But notwithſtanding, it is evident from both Scripture and Reaſon, that the divine Nature is Simple and Uncompounded, and that whatever is in God is God. We ſhould therefore be careful that while we compare the divine Perfections with the faint Emblems thereof that be in Creatures, to aſſiſt our Conceptions of them, that we do
<pb n="397" facs="unknown:005500_0400_1039673875AFE580"/>
in the mean Time ſeparate from them every Thing that argues imperfection.</p>
            <p>The Improvement of this Subject remains. And</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. The Conſideration of the <hi>Unity</hi> of the ſupream Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may juſtly excite in us an Abhorrence of all Idolatry, whether of a more craſs or ſubtile Kind; for by both the divine Unity is deny'd. The Polytheiſm of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> is but a ſpecious Sort of Atheiſm; they that Worſhip more than one God, do in Effect worſhip no God at all; becauſe they give him not that ſupream undivided Reſpect which is his due. 2 King xvii. 33.34. <hi>They feared the Lord, and ſerved their own God's, after the Manner of their Nations.—They fear not the Lord.</hi> How deteſtable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the Idolatry of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who reverence with a Religious Worſhip, Saints and Angels, yea Images and Relicts? What Reaſon have we to bleſs God while we live, that we are deliver'd from that <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bondage? And ſhould not the Unity of God incline us to deteſt all ſpiritual Idolatry, which conſiſts in giving our Hearts to, truſting in, and ſerving of divers Luſts and Pleaſures, <hi>viz.</hi> The Luſt of the Eye, the Luſt of Fleſh, and the Pride of Life. Some make a God of Pleaſure, 2 Tim. iii. 4. <hi>Lovers of Pleaſures more than Lovers of God.</hi> Moſt certainly, whatever we love more than God, we make a God: Others there be that make Money their God, they make Gold their Hope, and ſay to the fine Gold, <hi>thou art my Confidence,</hi> Job. xxxi. 24. Others make a God of their Belly. Philip iii. 19. <hi>Whoſe God is their Belly. Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> writes of a Fiſh <hi>"That hath its Heart in its Belly."</hi> This Fiſh is a proper Emblem of Epicures, for their Heart may be ſaid to be in their Belly; they cheifly mind their Gratification of their ſenſual Apetite. This is the Evil which God forbids in the firſt Command; and which, in ſome Reſpect,
<pb n="398" facs="unknown:005500_0401_1039673659842E48"/>
ſeems to exceed in Baſeneſs all the Reſt which are forbid by the other Precepts: Whatever we put in the Room of God, we may expect will prove a Devil to us.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. If there be but one God, their can be but one Religion, that is true in the World: And hence the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> obſerves, Epheſ. iv. 5. That <hi>there is one Faith, one Lord, one Baptiſm, one God and Father of all, who is above all, and thro' all, and in you all.</hi> If there were many God's, there might be many Religions, every God would be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip'd in his own Way: But it is unreaſonable to ſuppoſe that that God, who is one in his Being, ſhould appoint ſeveral Religions whereby he would be worſhiped. The Reaſon of the Heathens different Rites, was their adoring divers God's, whom they ſuppoſed they muſt Worſhip in a different Manner: Tho' there be many Ways to Hell, there is but one Road to Heaven, and that is the Path of Faith and Holineſs, without which no Man ſhall enjoy God. It is as Dangerous to ſet up a Religion, fundamentaly Falſe, as to ſet up a falſe God; for indeed the one ſuppoſes the other. But</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. We ſhould be excited to enquire, whether this one God be ours in a Covenant Way? Without which we can reaſonably take no Comfort in meditating upon this, or any other of his Attributes. Now this we may know by the following Particulars, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. If we fear this one habitually more than all; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is infinitely Greater and Mightier than all. (<hi>Mal.</hi> i. 6.)</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. If we deſire him habitually more than all; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is infinitely better than all beſides him (<hi>Pſ.</hi> lxxiii. 25.)</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. If we generally delight in him more than in all
<pb n="399" facs="unknown:005500_0402_10396734D5EA4678"/>
beſides him, becauſe his loving Kindneſs exceeds all other Enjoyments, yea even the Sweets of Life itſelf. (<hi>Pſa.</hi> iv. 6.7.)</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. If we truſt and hope in him more than all (ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally;) becauſe he excells all in Wiſdom and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, (<hi>Joſhua.</hi> xxiii. 14.)</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. If we from Love generally obey him before all; becauſe he is infinitely higher than all. The Sovereign Lord, the everlaſting King, who ſways the Scepter over the whole Univerſe, (<hi>Acts</hi> iv. 19.)</p>
            <p n="6">6thly. If we bewail the Abſence of this one God more then all other Loſſes. <hi>Pſ.</hi> xlii. 5. <hi>Why art thou caſt down O my Soul, why art thou diſquieted within me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7thly. If increaſe of Conformity to him in Mind and Life be the principal Object of our Deſire, Care and Labour. <hi>Philipi.</hi> iii. 13.14. <hi>I preſs forwards towards the Mark!</hi> If upon enquiry we find in ourſelves the aforeſaid Characters, truly we have great Reaſon to <hi>rejoyce,</hi> whatever outward Diſtreſſes we endure; becauſe in having one God for our Portion, we have more then all beſides him, infinitely more! His Wiſdom is Unſearchable, his Power Infinite, and his Goodneſs Incomprehenſible! As his Wiſdom can eaſily deviſe a Way for his People's Deliverance in their moſt Perplexing Immergency's, ſo his Power is able to effect it, Maugre all Oppoſition of Hell and Earth! And his Goodneſs as well as Promiſe engages his Wiſdom and Power in his Peoples behalf. Add to this, that his Immutability ſecures their Safety upon an unalterable Foundation! Surely then to uſe the <hi>Pſalmiſt's</hi> Language, <hi>Bleſſed are the People who are in ſuch a Caſe; yea bleſſed is that People, whoſe God is the Lord!</hi> Well then when our Minds are divided and diſtreſs'd with a Variety of Fears and Cares, ariſing from a View of the Wars, Debates, and Confuſions in the State and Church, as well as in Families and Neighbourhoods,
<pb n="400" facs="unknown:005500_0403_10396733311E3418"/>
let us bewail Sin, which has introduced all this Confuſion into the World, by breaking that Bleſſed Unity which once ſubſiſted between God and us, and thence enſu'd a Breach between Man and Man, between Man and himſelf. And having lamented Sin, the Source of Diſcord, let us give our whole Heart to one God, who is the Fountain of Sweetneſs, Concord and Unity, and humbly rejoyce in him as our All! And earneſtly aſk of him, that according to the Tenor of his gracious Covenant, he would be pleas'd to give to his People every where one Heart, that they may be one as <hi>Jehovah</hi> is one, and his Name one. (<hi>Ezek.</hi> xi. 19. <hi>Zecha.</hi> xiv. 9.)</p>
            <p>But how doleful is the Caſe of all ſuch who want the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid Characters; as they are without God ſo they are without <hi>Hope, Poor, Blind, Miſerable</hi> and <hi>Naked, (Epheſ.</hi> ii. 12. <hi>Rev.</hi> iii. 17.) without true Comfort, and without Defence; in the Fullneſs of their Sufficiency they are in Want; yea all the Perfections of God are engag'd againſt them. (<hi>Job</hi> ix. 4.) As thoſe that have God for their Portion are Happy in him, in Want of all other Things, ſo thoſe that want this Portion are Miſerable in the Poſſeſſion of all beſides him.</p>
            <p>Again from the Doctrine of God's <hi>Unity</hi> we may learn how Wicked the Practice of ſuch is, who when they have loſt Goods ſeek to Wizards and familiar Spirits how they may get their Goods again, this is expreſly condemn'd by the Law of God. (<hi>Deut.</hi> viii. xi.) There ſhall not be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that conſults with familiar Spirits. 2 Kings. i. 6. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, is it not becauſe there is not a God in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>that thou ſendeſt to enquire of</hi> Baal-zebub, <hi>the God of</hi> Eckron. Such who go to the Devil for Council, renounce the true God, and their baptiſmal Dedication to him!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="401" facs="unknown:005500_0404_10396731ABBE16F0"/>Is there but one God? What Reaſon then have we to be thankful that we have the Means of knowing him, while Multitudes who are alike to us by Nature are periſhing for Lack of Viſion? Our Lines have fallen to us in pleaſant Places, we have Line upon Line, and Precept upon Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept! The Harbingers of God are frequently proclaiming in our Ears, <hi>Hear O</hi> Iſrael, <hi>the Lord thy God is one Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is there but one God? Then let us, reduce our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from their vain Wandrings, and divided Courſes, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter other Lords and Lovers, and fix them in a united Chanel, and with intenſe Vehemence upon the Bleſſed God as their Center! Let <hi>Jehovah</hi> be the Object of our higheſt Regard, and the Foundation of our Truſt and Confidence! Let us devote ourſelves and our All to his Glory and Service! Surely he has the beſt right to our Love and Obedience who is the Author of our Beings! He beſt deſerves them who is the Fountain of all our Benefits, and he is beſt able to requite both, being infinite in Power and Goodneſs! O let us endeavour to pleaſe the One great and glorious God, by loving, believing, univerſal and ſteady Obedience! For this is the main Thing we have to mind in this preſent World! This reflects Honour upon our Profeſſion, brings Comfort into our own Minds, and tends to eſtabliſh the Kingdom of CHRIST among Men.</p>
            <p>And finally, Brethren, ſeeing there is but one God, let his People endeavour to be One as God is one: Let us endeavour to be One in <hi>Judgment</hi> and One in Affection: And hence the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts the Corinthians, <hi>to be all of one Mind,</hi> 1 Cor. i. 10. And it is ſaid, Acts iv. 32. <hi>That the Multitude that believed were of one Heart and one Soul.</hi> Nothing is more amiable in it ſelf, and ſerviceable to the Church of God, then <hi>for Brethren to dwell together in Unity,</hi> Pſal. cxxxiii. 1. <hi>This is like Hermons Dew</hi> and the

fragrant <hi>Ointment</hi> pour'd on <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Head! <hi>This Unity</hi> was what our Lord himſelf pray'd for, John xvii. 21. <hi>That they all may be One.</hi> Upon which Words <hi>Athanaſius</hi> gloſſeth thus, <q>Even as <hi>(ſays he)</hi> the Father and the Son are One in Eſſence, ſo we by ſome imperfect reſemblance are made One while we behold him. One among ourſelves, by mutual concord of Mind and unity of Spirit.</q> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> urgeth this Unity by various arguments, Epheſ. iv. 4, 5, 6. <hi>Endeavouring to keep the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace.</hi> We are all <hi>one myſtical Body,</hi> and every one of us Members of it, among which what is more advantageous than Harmony? There <hi>is one Spirit</hi> by whoſe Aſſiſtance we are baptiſed <hi>into one Body,</hi> 1 Cor. xii. 12, 13. There is <hi>one Hope of our Calling,</hi> viz. eternal Glory and Happineſs, Heb. xii. 22, 23. <hi>One Lord</hi> JESUS, <hi>one Faith in him, one Baptiſm, one God and Father of all.</hi> Let us therefore care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully avoid all ſchiſmatical Doctrines and Practices, which are ſo exceeding prejudicial to Religion. To this End let us Labour to be of a humble, charitable and forgiving Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, <hi>Charity hopes all Things, it ſuffers long, is kind, and is not eaſily provok'd.</hi> Let us earneſtly pray to the great God, that he would heal the Breaches of Zion, which are wide as the Sea, and cauſe his People to be one as he is one. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.

                  <p>But the Lord is the true God, he is the living God, and an everlaſting King: At his Wrath the Earth ſhall tremble and the Nations ſhall not be able to abide his Indignation!</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>IT is probable that the Prophecy contain'd in this Chapter, was delivered after the firſt Babyloniſh Captivity, becauſe it has a double Reference; the firſt Part reſpects thoſe that were carry'd Captive; and the latter Part reſpects thoſe that remain'd in the Land of <hi>Paleſtine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prophet in the Beginning of this Chapter, firſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes thoſe who were carry'd Captive into the Idolatrous Country of the Caldeans, and ſeriouſly cautions them againſt the Infection of it, verſe 1, 2. <hi>Thus ſayeth the Lord, learn not the Way of the Heathen.</hi> In the following Verſes the Prophet expoſes the Vanity of the Pagan Idolatry, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſuch ſort of Gods were but the Work of Men's Hands, and had neither Life nor Motion, he therefore ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes them in the 7th verſe, <hi>to cleave to the God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Temptation to the Contrary.</hi> This Advice he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forces in the Words of our Text, by repreſenting ſome of his Perfections, in Oppoſition to the Idols of the Heathen, <hi>But the Lord is the true God.</hi> The God's of the <hi>Pagans</hi> are vanity and a lye, counterfeit and impoſture; but <hi>Jehovah</hi> is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and really God, as well as the God of Truth a God who
<pb n="404" facs="unknown:005500_0407_1039672C6B091700"/>
cannot lie or deceive. <hi>He is the living God.</hi> The <hi>Pagan</hi> Idols are dumb dead Things, that have neither Life, Breath or Motion: But <hi>Jehovah</hi> is <hi>the living God,</hi> i. e. as <hi>Calvin</hi> juſtly explains, <q>He himſelf is endowed with Life, and is to others the Fountain of Life.</q> Pſal. xxxvi. 9. <hi>It is in him we live, and move and have our Being. Act.</hi> xvii. 28. God is Life it ſelf, has Life in himſelf, and is the Original of all that Life which Creatures enjoy. <hi>And an everlaſting King.</hi> He has a Right to rule, and has exercis'd Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion from everlaſting, and will to everlaſting; whereas the Idols of the <hi>Heathens</hi> are but of Yeſterday, and will ſoon ceaſe to be.—<hi>At his Wrath the Earth ſhall tremble, and the Nations ſhall not be able to abide his Indignation.</hi> The <hi>Prophet</hi> had obſerv'd in the 5th Verſe of this Chapter, that the <hi>Pagan</hi> Idols could do neither Evil or Good, they are poor impotent ſorry Shams, and Trifles of no Moment, unworthy of either Love or Fear! But on the Contrary the Wrath of <hi>Jehovah</hi> is dreadful, at this the Earth trembles, his Angry frown makes the Worlds Foundations ſhake and the Pillars of Heaven tremble, and the Nations, were all their Strength united, are as unable to reſiſt his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Indignation, as they are to endure it! <hi>Jehovah</hi> is the God of Nature, the Fountain of Being and Power and therefore all Nature is at his Diſpoſe and Controle, his Empire is Univerſal, Abſolute, Eternal; <hi>The Lord ſhall reign forever, thy God O</hi> Zion <hi>to all Generations!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Subject I purpoſe to ſpeak upon from this Text is <hi>the Life of God, he is the living God.</hi> In diſcourſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which I deſign</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>To prove the Life of God.</hi> And</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>To explain its Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then proceed to the <hi>Improvement.</hi> And</p>

               <pb n="405" facs="unknown:005500_0408_1039672AE82870F8"/>1ſt. I am to <hi>prove that God lives.</hi> To this End it may be obſerv'd, that the ſacred Scriptures frequently aſcribe Life to God, and aſſure us, that he is the Author of Life to all that poſſeſs it: And hence he is call'd <hi>the living God. (Iſa.</hi> xxxvii. 17. <hi>Dan.</hi> vi 34. <hi>Pſa.</hi> lxxxiv. 2. <hi>Mat.</hi> xvi. 16.) And in many other Places which it is needleſs to mention. The Almighty is likewiſe ſaid <hi>to be Life it ſelf. (Col.</hi> iii. 4. 1 <hi>John</hi> v. 20. And <hi>the Fountain of Life, Jer.</hi> ii. 13. <hi>Pſ.</hi> xxxvi. 10.) In him we are ſaid to <hi>live, move, and have our Being. (Act.</hi> xvii. 28.) The Oath which the Fathers us'd, was <hi>the Lord liveth, (Jer.</hi> v. 2.) And <hi>Jehovah</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſwears by nothing but by his Life and Holineſs: This Oath is us'd fourteen Times in the Propheſy of <hi>Ezekiel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover Life is not only attributed to God <hi>eſſentially,</hi> but <hi>perſonally</hi> to each of the ſacred Three, to <hi>God the Father,</hi> John v. 26. <hi>For as the Father hath Life in himſelf, ſo hath he given to the Son to have Life in himſelf.</hi> To God the Son, Joh. xiv. 19. <hi>Becauſe I live ye ſhall live alſo.</hi> Hence he is call'd <hi>the Prince of Life,</hi> and that not only becauſe he has Life in himſelf, by the Father as Mediator, but is alſo our Life, and poſſeſſes the Power of an endleſs Life (<hi>Joh.</hi> i. 4. <hi>Col.</hi> iii. 4. <hi>Heb.</hi> vii. 16.) Hence it is ſaid of him, <hi>Rev.</hi> i. 17, 18. that <hi>he is the firſt and the laſt;</hi> that <hi>he liveth and was dead, and behold he is alive forevermore; and that he hath the Keys of Hell and Death.</hi> Tho' his human Nature ſuffered Death to purchaſe Life for his People, yet his divine Nature cannot dye, but lives forever. Life is alſo attributed to <hi>God the Holy Ghoſt</hi> 2. Cor. iii. 3. And hence he is call'd <hi>the Spirit of Life,</hi> Rom. viii. 2.</p>
            <p>Reaſon likewiſe aſſures us of this Truth, <hi>that God lives,</hi> by the following Conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. It appears from the Effects of Life. God <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands, wills, loves,</hi> therefore he truly lives: Theſe are the
<pb n="406" facs="unknown:005500_0409_1039672922973980"/>
Effects of Life, and Effects demonſtrate the Being and Nature of their Cauſe; therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> juſtly and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently concludes from this, <q>That becauſe God underſtands all Things, he therefore lives a Bleſſed Life.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly. Thoſe Things live, which move, and ſtir them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Now God doth all Things of himſelf, he is the Firſt, and moſt perfect Cauſe of all, he is moſt Active by his Eſſence, yea a ſimple Act, he knows, diſcerns, wills, works, altogether of himſelf, and therefore muſt needs live.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. Life is a certain Perfection, which involves no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection in it. Thus thoſe Things that live are reckon'd more perfect than ſuch as do not, and therefore it cannot with any Shadow of Reaſon be deny'd to a Being, that is infinitely Perfect of, and in himſelf as <hi>Jehovah</hi> is.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. God is the Fountain of Life to all living Creatures. (<hi>Pſa.</hi> xxxvi. 10.) And this he could not be if he had not Life himſelf; for what one has not he cannot give. Here obſerve 1ſt. That God is the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Nature;</hi> and hence he is ſaid to <hi>breath into Man's Noſtrils the Breath of Life. (Gen.</hi> ii. 7.) And in him we are ſaid <hi>to live and move. (Act.</hi> xvii. 28.) And 2dly <hi>Jehovah</hi> is the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Grace.</hi> Epheſ. ix. 10. <hi>Not of Works leaſt any Man ſhould boaſt: For we are his Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, created in</hi> CHRIST JESUS <hi>unto good Works,</hi>—3dly. The Almighty is likewiſe the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Glory.</hi> Rom. vi. 23. <hi>For the Wages of Sin is Death, but the gift of God is eternal Life thro'</hi> JESUS CHRIST <hi>our Lord.</hi> Again</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. If God did not live, all the reſt of his Attributes, and he himſelf, would be Vain, and would not differ from the Idols of the <hi>Gentiles, who have Eyes and ſee not, Ears and hear not;</hi> and no wonder for they are dead. What would avail all the reſt of God's Perfections
<pb n="407" facs="unknown:005500_0410_1039672767D9C840"/>
without Life, ſeeing that without that, they cannot Act? I proceed to the</p>
            <p n="2">2d. Propos'd, which was to explain <hi>the Nature of the divine Life;</hi> which may be thus deſcrib'd, <hi>viz. That it is an eſſential Property of the divine Nature, whereby he is able to perform an infinite Variety of Action to a certain known and valuable End, with Council and Complacency.</hi> Epheſ. i. 11. <hi>Who worketh all Things after the Council of his own Will.</hi> That the aforeſaid Deſcription may be the better underſtood, let the following Particulars be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. That the <hi>Life of God</hi> is his Nature, Being or very Eſſence; and therefore he is call'd <hi>Life,</hi> as was obſerv'd and prov'd before: Whereas Creatures are only <hi>living,</hi> their Life is but a certain Faculty of their Being, and therefore different from it; but the <hi>Life of God</hi> co-inceeds with his Eſſence.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. The divine Life conſiſts in a Power of Action with Complacency: By a Power of Action we intend to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify an Ability in God to produce more Effects without himſelf then he doth, and not that the Almighty is at any Time Inactive. No, the Almighty is in continual Action, otherwiſe he would ſuffer a Change which is impoſſible; and therefore divines generally and juſtly obſerve, that <hi>the Almighty is a ſimple Act.</hi> This will farther appear by conſidering that thoſe Things are ſaid to live, who act of themſelves without being acted, or mov'd either by ſecond Cauſes, (in this ſenſe Life belongs to Creatures) or without any prior moving Cauſe at all, and ſo God himſelf Lives: The Life of Creatures ſprings from ſome Compoſition, <hi>e.g. Natural Life</hi> from the Union of the Soul with the Body, which being broke all Power of natural Action ceaſes: <hi>Spiritual Life</hi> from the Union of the Soul to original Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
<pb n="408" facs="unknown:005500_0411_10396725C63BDEF8"/>
which being broken all Power of working Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ceaſes. Rom. viii. 8. <hi>Thoſe that are in the Fleſh can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pleaſe God.</hi> And <hi>eternal</hi> Life ſprings from a perfect Union with God, as the chief Good; which being broken the Soul cannot enjoy God, or rejoyce in him.</p>
            <p>Moreover their is a fourfold Life in Creatures, <hi>viz.</hi> Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getative, Senſitive, Rational, and Mixt. 1ſt. A <hi>Vegetative Life</hi> is that whereby Things are able to do that which is requiſite for acquiring and conſerving the full Strength of their Nature, and the Propogation of their Kind; this is the Life of Herbs. 2dly. A <hi>ſenſitive Life</hi> is that Faculty whereby Creatures are enabled to diſcern Things that are hurtful to them, and Things that are good for them, and to ſhun the one and ſeek the other; this is the Life of Beaſts: Theſe are imperfect Kinds of Life which the meaneſt Beings enjoy, and therefore cannot be aſcribed to God. But 3dly. There is a more noble kind of Life call'd <hi>Rational,</hi> by which the Poſſeſſor of it is enabled to act with Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and reaſonable Complacency. And 4thly there is a <hi>Mixt Life</hi> which reſults from the two firſt Kinds of Life only, and this belongs to brute Animals, or from all the Three and Exiſts in Men.</p>
            <p>Now we muſt not conceive in God any ſuch imperfect Thing as <hi>Growth</hi> or <hi>Senſe,</hi> for he is a ſimple, ſpiritual, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial and perfect Being. The moſt <hi>perfect Kind of Life</hi> muſt therefore be aſcrib'd to him, <hi>viz. Rational,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Being of God is conceiv'd by us, as active Simply of itſelf; when in our Ideas of God we adjoin <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Action,</hi> we have a juſt Notion of his Life.</p>
            <p>It may be here farther obſerv'd, that a Man hath four Kinds of Faculties in the Exerciſe of which he liveth, and Life in him is an Ability to exerciſe them: He hath an <hi>Underſtanding, Will, Affections,</hi> and a <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>move</hi> and <hi>work outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi>
               <pb n="409" facs="unknown:005500_0412_10396723CFB81410"/>
all theſe the Almighty aſcribes to himſelf in his Word. But</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. Another Particular, conſiderable in the aforeſaid De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Life of God, was this, viz. <hi>His acting to ſome known and valuable End,</hi> this is but a neceſſary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent of acting rationally; an intelligent Agent muſt have ſome End in View, and ſuch an End as is worthy of his Choice. Now the End that God propoſes both Scripture and Reaſon inform us, is his own Glory, or the Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his divine Excellency. And hence <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerves, <hi>Pro.</hi> xvi. 4. <hi>That he made all Things for himſelf.</hi> This is certainly the moſt noble End, becauſe it moſt nearly relates the beſt of Beings; and therefore it muſt be ſuppos'd to be the End which the Almighty has chiefly in View in all his Actions, ſeeing he ever acts with unerring Council.</p>
            <p>But tho' there be ſome Analogy between the Life of God and that of intelligent Beings, as has been obſerv'd, yet they differ in many Things very widely, as will appear by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the following Properties of the divine Life, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring them with the Properties of the Lives of Creatures. Now the Divine Life is</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. <hi>Eſſential,</hi> viz. His Nature or Being, as has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd before, whereas the Life of Creatures is but a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Property, of their Beings, And</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. The Life of God is <hi>Neceſſary,</hi> this reſults unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably from the former Property, if the Being of God exiſts neceſſarily of it ſelf, as it certainly does, as the Name <hi>Jehovah</hi> ſignifies, and truly without this he could not be God, and if the divine Life is the ſame with it, (as has been obſerv'd) then it muſt be <hi>Neceſſary</hi> alſo; and hence the Almighty is ſaid to have Life in himſelf: Whereas all Creatures have but a borrow'd precarious and dependant Life communicated to them by God who is the Source of Life.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="410" facs="unknown:005500_0413_10396722296C33C8"/>3dly. The Life of God is <hi>Perfect,</hi> he has the full and perfect Poſſeſſion of an interminable Life at once, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Life of Creatures is imperfect, growing by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Days, Months and Years, our Life glides away in a continual Flux and Succeſſion of Moments; but the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Life is an <hi>everlaſting NOW,</hi> without any Succeſſion in Duration.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. The Life of God is <hi>Infinite,</hi> without Beginning or End, hence he is ſaid <hi>only to have Immortality.</hi> (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> vi. 16.) The Immutability of the divine Nature, as well as his Self-exiſtence, ſhew the impoſſibility of his ſuffering a Change by Death. But on the contrary, the Life of all Creatures had a Beginning, and in reſpect of the moſt of them, it will have an End. I proceed to the Improvement of this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, And</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt the Subject that has been diſcours'd upon, offers Matter of Reproof to all ſuch who behave towards God, as if he were a dumb Idol, that neither ſaw, heard or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, or could reward or avenge what is done in the World, and who therefore do not love, or fear, or worſhip him, as if he could neither do them <hi>Good or Hurt, Zeph.</hi> i. 12. And in their Straits they are ſo full of Diſtruſt and Dejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as if they believ'd there was no God in Heaven who liv'd and ſaw their Miſeries, and was able to ſend them Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours ſuited to them! What can ſuch Perſons expect who thus make an Idol of God? But that by the Executions of his Wrath, he will make them know to their dreadful Coſt, <hi>that he is the Lord.</hi> Ezek. xxxv. 9. But to proceed</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. Let us examine ourſelves, by propoſing the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Queſtions, viz.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Do we content ourſelves with having a Name to live when we are dead? If ſo our Caſe is dreaful! Or</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="411" facs="unknown:005500_0414_1039672086E726A0"/>2dly. Hath the living God quickned <hi>us, when we were dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins?</hi> Epeſ. ii. 4, 5.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. Does the ſuppos'd ſpiritual Life in us, produce Senſe, Breath, Motion, Warmth? Are we at Times ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſenſible of the inward Diſorders of our Souls? Does our Unbelief and other Corruptions afflict us? And do we know what the Abſence of God means, as well as his Preſence, by our own Experience; do we breath after God in the General above all others? (<hi>Pſ.</hi> lxxiii. 25.) Is it our chief Care and Study for the moſt Part to grow in Grace? And does our principal Zeal and Warmth generally run in a religious Channel?</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. Do we generally labour to ſerve the living God in a living Way? i. e. Not only with rais'd Affections, but approaching to him thro' CHRIST the new and living Way, <hi>the Way, the Truth and the Life?</hi> Heb. x. 20.</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. Have we ſorrow'd for the great Evil <hi>of forſaking the living God, the Fountain of living Waters, and running to broken Ciſterns?</hi> Jer. ii. 13. And do we watch over our Unbelief, <hi>that we depart no more from him?</hi> Heb. iii. 12.</p>
            <p n="6">6thly. Is God the Foundation of our Hope and Truſt, and nothing elſe beſides him? (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> vi. 17.)</p>
            <p>To ſuch as can anſwer in the Affirmative to the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Queſtions, (the firſt excepted) this Subject miniſters Comfort in every Diſtreſs, being perſwaded that our Redeemer lives, and that he is the Strength of our Life, particularly (1ſt.) in the <hi>Difficulties</hi> of a <hi>Natural Life,</hi> if Sickneſs threatens an End of it, if Poverty removes the Supports of Life, if Enemies ſeek it, and lay Snares to deſtroy it, if the Fear of Death and Horror of Putrifaction and Pain perplex us? What yields a ſweeter Support, in thoſe and ſuch like Caſes, than to think that our God and Redeemer lives, yea that he is Life it ſelf, and the Fountain thereof: As he
<pb n="412" facs="unknown:005500_0415_1039671EDE576520"/>
has given Life, ſo he can preſerve it in the midſt of all Dangers, and againſt the Force of all Enemies, yea he can reſtore it when loſt, <hi>for he is the Reſurrection and the Life!</hi> Again,</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. In the <hi>Difficulties</hi> of the <hi>ſpiritual Life,</hi> when we find ourſelves cold and dead, unfit for, and unable to perform the Duties of Religion, how ſupporting and ſweet is it to think <hi>that as the Father hath Life in himſelf, ſo hath he given to the Son to have Life in himſelf, that we might have Life in him.</hi> 1 John iv. 9. <hi>Yea that he is our Life.</hi> Col. iii. 4. And</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. In the <hi>Difficulties</hi> of <hi>Eternal Life:</hi> When the Fear of Death and the Body of Death pain us, ſo that we are oblig'd to ſigh and ſay, <hi>who ſhall deliver us?</hi> Men and Brethren what ſhall we do to inherit eternal Life? In this Caſe how ſweet is it to think that God lives, and is the great Source of Life; and likewiſe that the Redeemer lives, and is our Life? Yea that to this End he was given by his Father, that <hi>we ſhould not periſh but have eternal Life</hi> (To this Purpoſe was his Death, that <hi>he might purchaſe Life for us</hi>) And alſo that the Holy Spirit is a Spirit of Life who quickens? (<hi>Joh.</hi> vi. 63.)</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. The Conſideration of the infinite or immortal Life of God, may juſtly humble us who carry our Breath, our Life, in our Noſtrils, and are liable to ſuch a manifold Death, <hi>viz.</hi> Temporal, Spiritual and Eternal, who may be ſpeedily depriv'd of Life by the meaneſt Infects, the moſt inconſiderable Incidents, as both Scripture and Hiſtory in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, and who have brought ourſelves into this mortal State by Sin! 2 Sam. xiv. 14. <hi>For we muſt needs die, and are as Water ſpilt on the Ground, which cannot be gathered up again.</hi> Pſal. cxliv. 3.4. <hi>Lord what is Man that thou takeſt Knowledge of him. Man is like to Vanity, his Days are as a Shaddow that paſſeth away.</hi> Our Life is like a Flower
<pb n="413" facs="unknown:005500_0416_1039671D32BE91F0"/>
of the Graſs, <hi>which flouriſhes in the Morning, but in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening is cut down and withereth,</hi> Pſal. xc. 5.6. <hi>What is our Life,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle James, <hi>but a Vapour which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears for a little time, and then vaniſheth away. Man that is born of a Woman,</hi> ſays <hi>Job, is of few Days and full of Trouble, he cometh forth like a Flower and is cut down, he fleeth alſo as a Shadow and continueth not.</hi> As <hi>Bernard</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, <q>In theſe Words is deſcrib'd the ſhortneſs, certainty, frailty and manifold Adverſity of our Life.</q> How much therefore may we be humbled, when we compare our Life with the Life of God? What are we but Duſt and Aſhes? And if our Life be ſo ſhort and uncertain, how vain muſt all the Enjoyments of Life be? Seeing they cannot be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to us than that on which they depend! O therefore let us be wean'd from the dying Things of Time and Breath after Immortality! Let us earneſtly ſeek it in the immortal God, that when our Heart and Fleſh fails, he may be the Strength of our Heart, and our Portion for Ever!</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. The Conſideration of the Life of God ſhould excite us to glorify him in Imitation of the heavenly Hoſt. Rev. iv. 9.10. <hi>When thoſe Beaſts gave Glory and Honour and Thanks to him, that ſat on the Throne, who liveth for ever and ever. The Four and Twenty Elders fall down before him that ſat on the Throne, and worſhip him that liveth for ever and ever, and caſt their Crowns before the Throne.</hi> I ſay we ſhould glorify God, not only becauſe he has Life, which is a Primary Perfection of Mankind, but by the Help of which all their Faculties are actuated, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which they would be Vain: Thus the Life of God actuates all his other Attributes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But becauſe he is Life it ſelf, yea ſuch a Life as is Independent, Infinite, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Immutable, and the Author of all that Life which
<pb n="414" facs="unknown:005500_0417_1039671B907C4E70"/>
every Creature enjoys: It's on theſe Accounts that God doth ſo often glory of his Life, as well as ſwear by it, and thereby diſtinguiſh himſelf from falſe God's who are but dead Idols.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing that Jehovah is the original of our natural and ſpiritual Life, and is to be ſo of our eternal likewiſe, to purchaſe which he gave his only begotten Son to Death, let us ever retain a grateful Senſe of this in our Minds, and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the Praiſes of God for it in Speech and Action!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally,</hi> The Conſideration of <hi>the Life of God,</hi> ſhould incline us to live to him! Which conſiſts principally in the following Particulars, <hi>viz.</hi> 1ſt. In <hi>directing</hi> all our <hi>Actions,</hi> whether Natural, Civil or Religious, <hi>to his Glory,</hi> as our higheſt Mark. 1 Cor. x. 31. <hi>Whether therefore ye Eat or Drink, or whatſoever ye do, do all to the Glory of God.</hi> 2dly. In <hi>conforming our Actions</hi> according to his <hi>revealed Will.</hi> 1 Pet. iv. 2. <hi>That he no longer ſhould live the reſt of his time in the Fleſh, to the Luſts of Men, but to the Will of God.</hi> 3dly. It conſiſts in <hi>living by the Power of God,</hi> i. e. when we being ſenſible of our inability to do what is pleaſing to God, depend upon his Aſſiſtance and Influence. (<hi>Gal</hi> ii. 19.20.) Now the <hi>Life of God</hi> affords a manifold Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of living to him. For 1ſt. Our God lives, and in his Life conſiſts his chief Perfection, and ours in Imitation of it. 2dly. He is the Author of our Life, and therefore it is but reaſonable it ſhould be referred to him. 3dly. Our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer has Life in himſelf, is our Life, yea <hi>has died that we might live; not to ourſelves but to him that has dyed for us.</hi> 2 Cor v. 15. 4thly. The <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> is a Spirit of Life, who quickens poor dead and ſtupid Sinners, by Virtue of his Office. (<hi>Joh.</hi> vi. 63.) O! therefore while we do live, let us live to the living God, and labour to be fervent and and lively in his Service; in this Way we may expect, in
<pb n="415" facs="unknown:005500_0418_10396719C7CC8178"/>
due Time, to be tranſlated thro' divine Grace, into a State of immortal Life and Glory. And ſuch as are under the Power of ſpiritual Death, which you may know by your being without ſpiritual Senſe, Breath and Motion, I exhort in the Language of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> chap. v. 14. <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt, ariſe from the Dead and Chriſt ſhall give you Light! What meaneſt thou O Sleeper! Ariſe call upon thy God if ſo be that he will pitty you that you periſh not!</hi> While you are thus ſpiritually Dead, you can have neither Communion with the living God here, nor enjoy him hereafter, but are under his Curſe and Wrath. The Law you have broken condemns you, Gal. iii. 10. <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all Things that are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Book of the Law to do them.</hi> The Goſpel alſo which you believe not likewiſe rejects you! Mark xvi. 12. Heaven is ſhut up againſt you, and Hell is open to receive you! Your Services muſt needs be loathſome becauſe they are Dead! Poor, poor Sinners! ye are every Moment in Danger of everlaſting Miſery; and how ſoon ye may be engulph'd in it ye know not! And will ye be eaſie and unconcern'd in ſuch a ſttate of extream and inexpreſſible Danger? God forbid! O think frequently and ſolemnly of your doleful Caſe and cry fervently and unweariedly to the living God for ſpiritual Life, without which you muſt eternally feel the Power of the ſecond Death.</p>
            <p>Poor Sinners! Are not the plain Signs of Spiritual Death upon you? For is not your Eyes cloſe ſhut? You have no affecting apprehenſion of your Diſeaſe and Danger, nor of the Remedy a gracious God has provided for periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Souls!</p>
            <p>You hear not, to any purpoſe, the dreadful Thunders of the Divine Law, nor the gentler Wiſpers of the Goſpel of Grace and Salvation! And as you have Eyes and ſee
<pb n="416" facs="unknown:005500_0419_1039671843A0D158"/>
not, Ears and hear not the Things that belong to your Peace, ſo you have Hearts and feel not! when the Heraulds, the Harbingers of God denounce aloud the dreadful Curſes of <hi>Jehovah</hi> againſt you from <hi>Ebal</hi>'s Mount! When we unvail the Diſmal Vault of Hell, and ſet it before you in all it's flaming Terrors, yauning Wide to devour you! When we repreſent the Vengeance of Omnipotence hanging over your Guilty Heads, as a gloomy Cloud, Pregnant with woe and Ruin, every Moment ready to break upon you in a formidable reſiſtleſs Torrent, and drown you in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction! When we take the Sword of God and point it at your Hearts, alas ye do not feel the Thruſt, or grieve o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver your Miſery! When we bend the legal Bow and ſhoot at your Boſoms, the Arrows rebound as if they ſtruck on a Wall of Marble, and make no abidding Impreſſion!</p>
            <p>And when we ſpeak in ſofter Strains of the humble Charms of divine Grace and Love, and pronounce Bleſſings upon all believing Penitents from the Summit of <hi>Gereſim!</hi> Alas ye feel it not, but are as inſenſible as Stones, as dead Corps! As the former did not alarm your Fear, ſo neither does this incite your Love! When we labour to open the inexpreſſible Beauties of JESUS, of Holineſs, of Paradiſe, and ſet them in their proper Light, alas ye are not affected! The Condeſcention of the Son of God in aſſuming our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, under its preſent ruinous Circumſtances, his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Form of a Servant, <hi>who was God over all bleſſed for ever,</hi> his becoming poor, that we might be made rich, in a Word his being expos'd to all the Inſtances of Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Ignominy and Contempt in Life, and at laſt to a moſt painful and ſhameful Death, is enough to affect any who have the leaſt Spark of Life! But what leſs than Almightineſs can effectually affect the Dead?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="417" facs="unknown:005500_0420_103967167925A768"/>And are there not ſome among you, who find yourſelves without Taſte and Savour of Spiritual Things, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent yourſelves with a ſpiritleſs Form or Round of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Duty, without any Growth in Grace, you think you have got as much as will do for Heaven, and are therefore ſatisfied? O! this is a plain Sign, that you are ſtark blind, and ſtone dead.</p>
            <p>Awake poor Sinners! in the Name of God out of your damnable Sleep, before your Caſe be paſt all Remedy, there is no Hopes of your Converſion and Salvation, while ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in this Sleep and Death; ye muſt be awakned or damned, it is the Loſt that CHRIST is only come to ſeek and ſave. <hi>The Whole need no Phyſician, but the Sick.</hi> If you ask what you ſhall do to get awakened into this Life? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, firſt try by Examination to get a thorough Knowledge of your dead and damnable State: For if you fail in this, you are never like to be deeply affected with the Miſeries of your Condition: Ye ſhould likewiſe think often with the utmoſt Seriouſneſs, upon <hi>Death, Judgment,</hi> and <hi>Hell-Fire,</hi> in all the Forms of Terror, in which Scripture and Reaſon do repreſent them! Attend diligently upon the Word <hi>Faithfully</hi> diſpens'd; for this is a principal Mean of divine Appointment of bringing the Dead to Life. By the Fooliſhneſs of Preaching God ſaves thoſe that believe. Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God. Cry frequently and vehemently to God for the awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Influencies of his Holy Spirit, and beware of quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them by <hi>Sloth, preſumptuous Hopes,</hi> or <hi>ſining againſt Light.</hi> Ye ungodly Sinners of every Age and Order, I charge you in the Name of the living God, and adjure you by his Authority, to awake, elſe you muſt be burnt for ever in the Flames of Hell! Don't think that your dead Devotions, unperform'd Reſolutions, ineffectual Affections,
<pb n="418" facs="unknown:005500_0421_10396714B34313D0"/>
or external Priviledges, <hi>viz.</hi> Baptiſm, and the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, will ſtand you inſtead when arraign'd before the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bar of the dreadful God! For neither Circumciſion or Uncircumciſion, avails any Thing but the New-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. You that are in the Fleſh cannot pleaſe God by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Thing you do: <hi>A corrupt Tree,</hi> as our Lord obſerves, <hi>cannot bring forth good Fruit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Awake poor Sinners! for the Guilt of all your Sins lies like Mountains of Lead upon your wretched Souls! And conſider I beſeech you, that all ye have been doing ſince ye were born, is in ſome reſpect Sin, in a greater or leſſer Degree; ye have been going aſtray from the Womb like wild Aſſes Colts, and every Imagination of the Tho'ts of your Hearts have been only Evil continually; ye have been ſinning againſt Light and Love, againſt Law and Goſpel, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Mercies and Judgments: Thus you may ſee that your Sins rival the Stars for Multitude, and are red as Crimſon in their Agravations; and you may aſſure yourſelves, that God's Juſtice will oblige him to Proportion your Pains accordingly, O then! How Inexpreſſible and Exquiſite muſt your eternal Tortures be, if ye continue in this impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent Security. Poor Sinners! Me thinks the Songs, the Shouts, the harminious Hoſanahs of all the Hoſts of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven invite you to <hi>awake,</hi> without which ye cannot be admitted into their honourable and happy Society, and join in their delightful Anthems with greatful Accents, beſides the dolorous Groans and hideous Scrieks of damned Men, and damned Angels, in the flaming Furnace of Tophet, may juſtly alarm you out of your accurſed Stupor: For after a few Moments, ye muſt roar with them, except ye repent! Nothing but the abus'd Patience of God and the ſlender Thread of your Life, keep you from plunging down into that flaming Lake, that burning Main! And for what you

know the Patience of God may expire towards you before the next Mornings Light, and then you are undone! un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done! undone forever! O if the Thread of your Life breaks while you remain in this dead State, you are gone paſt all Hopes forever, Dead and Damned at once, yea Damned to all Eternity! And how many Accidents are you inviron'd with? Are not many carry'd off ſpeedily and unexpectedly? And why may not this be your Caſe? I beſeech you Friends by all the Happineſs of Heaven, by all the Torments of Hell, for the Sake of God the Father, Son and Spirit, by all the Regard you owe to your Deathleſs Souls, your Reaſon, your Conſcience, as well as the Ambaſſadors of CHRIST a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, that ye would <hi>awake.</hi> I beſeech you as a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of the great God, as on my bended Knees, by the Groans, Tears, and Wounds of CHRIST, that you would <hi>Awake.</hi> Yea I charge you by all the Curſes of the Law, and Bleſſings of the Goſpel, that ye would <hi>Awake.</hi> My Friends, you are witneſſes againſt yourſelves, that I have ſet Death and Life before you, O chooſe Life that ye may live! <hi>Let the wicked Man forſake his Way, and the unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Man his Thoughts, and turn to God and he will have Mercy upon him, and to our God for he will abundantly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don!</hi> O Sirs! conſider theſe Things, as ye will anſwer it at the Tribunal of CHRIST at the laſt Day.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Doctrine of the Trinity, is undoubtedly of the higheſt Importance in Chriſtianity: For the whole Scheme of Redemption is built upon this funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Point, namely, That God the Father did from all Eternity purpoſe to ſend his only begotten Son in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World to aſſume human Nature that therein he might ſatisfy divine Juſtice, by his Suffering and Obedience. That the Son of God in the fulneſs of Time, did as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, obey his Father's Injunctions, in enduring that Weight of Wrath, which was due for the Sins of the Elect World, and that it is the Office of the Holy Spirit to make effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Application of the Purchaſe of CHRIST to them. Now if the Diſtinction of Perſons in the Trinity be remov'd, theſe Things cannot be conſiſtently ſupported: For it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to ſuppoſe, that the ſame Perſon ſhould ſend himſelf, and ſatisfy himſelf, &amp;c. And thus the whole Fabrick of Chriſtianity in reſpect of its grand Peculiars would ſink, its Foundation being deſtroy'd, and the Religion of Nature take Place of reveal'd.</p>
            <p>But tho' the Doctrine of the Trinity, be of the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance in the Chriſtian Syſtem, yet it is incomprehenſible!
<pb n="421" facs="unknown:005500_0424_1039670FA7930310"/>
Neither ſhould this be wondred at, ſeeing there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Things in Nature, which we cannot fully conceive of or explain, ſuch as the Reaſon of the Growth, and different Colours, as well as Shapes of Vegetables, and of the various inſtincts of brute Animals. Not to mention the Nature of our own Souls, their Union with our Bodies, and Way of acting upon them. If Things that are of a finite Nature do thus poze and nonpluſs our weak Underſtandings, is it ſtrange that the infinite Perfections of the divine Nature ſhould tranſcend the Comprehenſion of a finite Mind? The Diſtance being ſo vaſt between the Object, and our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.</p>
            <p>Neither is it unreaſonable to believe, what we have no equal or adequate Ideas of, elſe we muſt believe in none of the divine Attributes: For every of thoſe ſurpaſs the higheſt Flight, the utmoſt Verge of a Creatures Thought. e. g. Altho' natural Reaſon aſſures us, that there is a God, and that Self-exiſtence is neceſſarily included among the Number of his unalienable Perfections, yet how imperfect is the Idea we form of it? We are likewiſe aſſured by the cleareſt Dictates of unbias'd Reaſon, that God is immenſe without Extention, and eternal without Succeſſion in Duration. But what poſitive Image can our Minds form of ſuch Things? Are not our Thoughts ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up and loſt in Obſcurity when we try to graſp ſuch ſublime and incomprehenſible Objects? We may be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore truly ſaid to believe more concerning God, than we do or can comprehend; otherwiſe indeed, we do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Being of a God at all: For whatever our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings graſp, cannot, but like it ſelf, be finite, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is finite is not God. That there are certain Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in God, both Scripture and Reaſon inform us, but how theſe are in God, we cannot fully conceive or expreſs!

but this Knowledge admits of various Degrees; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it reaches no farther than the Proof of the Exiſtence of Things, together with ſome negative Ideas or Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of what they are not; and ſometimes it extends to the Manner of their Exiſtence, and therefore it is ſo far from being abſurd, that it is neceſſary, for the Reaſon aforeſaid, to believe that there is ſomething in God, which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not graſp.</p>
            <p>Seeing then the Doctrine of the Trinity, is ſo important and intricate. It was well obſerv'd by <hi>Auſtine</hi> of old re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting it, <q>That in nothing Men are apt to err more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily and dangerouſly.</q> 
               <hi>(In nihilo facilius, et periculoſius erratur)</hi> But how contrary to this, is the unreaſonable Notion of ſome Moderns, who plead for the innocency of Errors of the groſeſt Kind, at leaſt of thoſe that are ſincere Enquirers after Truth, who are notwithſtanding far from it? As tho' their Endeavours would entitle them to Happineſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Knowledge of Fundamentals.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But ſurely, it is not the Sincerity of our Enquiries after important Truths, but the Succeſs thereof, that is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded in this, as well as other Means that are us'd to obtain ſo valuable an End, we may as well ſuppoſe, that ſincere Endeavours to obtain many of thoſe Graces that accompany Salvation, ſuch as Faith, Love to God, and Evangelical Obedience, will ſupply or attone for the Want of them, as aſſert that our inſucceſsful Enquiries af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the great Doctrines of Religion will excuſe our Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance thereof, eſpecially when we conſider that Blindneſs of Mind, as well as hardneſs of Heart, is included among thoſe ſpiritual Judgments, which are the Conſequence of our fallen State. And alſo that God diſplays the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of his Grace, as much in leading the Soul into all neceſſary Truth, as he does in any other Things that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
<pb n="423" facs="unknown:005500_0426_1039670C5B373578"/>
to Salvation. However it is not our Buſineſs to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, the final States of Men, but rather to pray that the Ignorant and Erronious may be brought to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the Truth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean Time we may truly ſay, that Errors in Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, (eſpecially when they touch the Foundation of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) are very perilous, as well as Errors in Practice. And hence we read of damnable Hereſies. But how far Error in Opinion may conſiſt with a gracious State, we cannot preciſely and peremtorily determine. It is therefore extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary, to attend with the utmoſt Care and Caution to what the ſacred Scriptures relate concerning the Trinity, and to beware of giving a lawleſs Looſe to our own Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations: For it is better, as one well obſerves <q>To be Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the Depths of it, than not to retain the Limits of Truth concerning it. <hi>Melius eſt neſcire Centrum, quam non tenere circulum.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Text I have choſen to diſcourſe upon, gives us an excellent Deſcription of the important Point under our preſent Conſideration in three Particulars; for 1ſt. Here we have a Trinity of Perſons aſſerted, mention is made of <hi>Three,</hi> and a perſonal Action aſcrib'd to them, namely, that of <hi>bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Witneſs; There are Three that bear Record in Heaven.</hi> Now the Matter of this Witneſs or Teſtimony is, that JESUS is the Son of God, and the Meſſiah promis'd, as appears from the 1ſt. 5th. and 9th. Verſes of this Chapter, the <hi>Manner</hi> rather than the <hi>Place</hi> of the Teſtimony, is ſignify'd by thoſe Words, <hi>in Heaven.</hi> The Sacred Three have and do bear Witneſs in a majeſtick and glorious Way to the aforeſaid Truth: Thus the Father teſtify'd of the Man JESUS, by an immediate Voice from Heaven, at his Baptiſm, this <hi>is my beloved Son hear ye him,</hi> the eternal Word own'd it's perſonal Union with the aſſum'd human Nature, on the
<pb n="424" facs="unknown:005500_0427_1039670AB4838EC8"/>
Mount of Transfiguration, by that divine Glory wherewith it was there cloth'd. Joh. i. 14. <hi>And we beheld his Glory, the Glory, as of the only Begotten of the Father full of Grace and Truth.</hi> And the Holy Spirit likewiſe witneſſed by deſending viſibly upon him like a Dove at his Baptiſm. And 2dly. The Names of the ſacred Three are expreſs'd, <hi>viz.</hi> the Father, Word, and Spirit. The firſt Perſon of the Trinity is call'd Father, to ſignify his eternal Generation of the Son. The ſecond Perſon is call'd the Word in our Text, and in other Places of Scripture. (<hi>See John.</hi> i. 1. 1 <hi>John</hi> i. 1.) To expreſs not only his Office in the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of his Fathers Will to us, (<hi>Mat.</hi> xi. 27.) but alſo his ineffable Generation, as a Word is begotten in our Thoughts and is the expreſs Image of them. The Third Perſon of the Trinity is call'd <hi>Ghoſt</hi> or Spirit to ſignify his Perſonal Property, which is to proceed from the Father and the Son, the Manner of which ſeems to be ſhadow'd forth by breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for as much as the Word Spirit is deriv'd of a Verb, which ſignifies to breath. <hi>(pnewma a pneo ſpiro)</hi> Now the Bleſſed Spirit is call'd <hi>Holy,</hi> to ſignify what is his peculiar Office in the divine <hi>OEconomy,</hi> reſpecting the Salvation of the Elect which is to make them Holy by his efficacious Influences.</p>
            <p>But before I proceed to diſcourſe farther upon this Text, I think it neceſſary to offer ſomething concerning its divine Original. It is true ſeveral learned Men acknowledge, that it is not found in divers ancient Manuſcrips, and Verſions drawn from them. But what then, it is found in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as <hi>Beza</hi> obſerves, <hi>Jerom</hi> aſſerts in his Letter to <hi>Euſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius,</hi> That <hi>it was contain'd in all the</hi> Greek <hi>Copies of his Time,</hi> and complains <hi>that it was omitted thro the Negligence of the Latin Interpreters.</hi> Now it is certain that <hi>Jerom</hi> was one of the moſt learned of the Fathers, in reſpect of the Languages and Church Hiſtory. What tho' this Text
<pb n="425" facs="unknown:005500_0428_1039670913EC7E90"/>
was omitted in Writings of the Fathers of the fourth Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary, it might be wanting in the Copies they conſulted, and be in others notwithſtanding: But methinks it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſatisfy us in this Point, that it is not only menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd frequently by the Writers of ſucceeding Ages, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by ſome of the third Century, particularly by <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Tertulian. Cyprian</hi> wrote before the Birth of <hi>Arius,</hi> in the third Century, and endur'd Martyrdom in the Year 260: And it is certain that he had not ſuch an allegorical or myſtical Turn of Mind, as <hi>Origen</hi> and ſome others, and therefore his Teſtimony is the more to be depended upon. In his Epiſtle concerning the Unity of the Church he hath theſe Words, <hi>viz. The Lord ſayeth, that I, and the Father are one; and again it is written, concerning the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, and theſe Three are one. (dicit Dominus, ego et Pater unum Sumus, et itrum de patre et filio. et ſpiritu ſancto Scriptum eſt, et hi treſ unum ſunt.)</hi> Now the moſt antient Manuſcript extant in the World, which ſome ſay is at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> is not ſuppos'd by any to reach ſo far back as the third Century. It is likewiſe thought by ſome learned Men, that <hi>Tertulian</hi> in his Book againſt <hi>Praxeas,</hi> refers to this Text in theſe Words, <hi>which Three are one. (qui tres unum ſunt)</hi> 
               <q>To what has been ſaid, I may add, that Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> obſerves in his <hi>Synopſis, that</hi> Athanaſius <hi>in his firſt Book to</hi> Theophilus <hi>and</hi> Idacius <hi>who flouriſh'd in the Year</hi> 308 <hi>under</hi> Theodoſius, <hi>produc'd this Place of Scripture againſt the</hi> Arians.</q> This Verſe might be omitted in ſome Manuſcrips thro' the Careleſneſs of the Tranſcriber, but could not be added without an evil Deſign; which it is unreaſonable to ſuppoſe in this Caſe, becauſe it could not be anſwered by ſuch an Addition, ſeeing the Trinity is elſewhere fully aſſerted, as I ſhall afterwards prove: It is therefore much more probable, that the <hi>Arians</hi> have
<pb n="426" facs="unknown:005500_0429_103967076E516430"/>
corrupted this Place of Scripture, than the Orthodox, ſeeing that it ſo directly overſets their Hereſy; whereas the oppoſite Doctrine is ſufficiently confirm'd by other Places; and both <hi>Ambroſe (de fide)</hi> and <hi>Socrates</hi> in his eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Hiſtory, do witneſs, that the <hi>Arians</hi> were Guilty of this Kind of Fraud; neither was it difficult for them to effect it, when ſome of their Number, namely, <hi>Conſtantius</hi> and <hi>Valens,</hi> poſſes'd the imperial Throne and baniſh'd the Orthodox; and in the mean Time fix'd <hi>Arian</hi> Biſhops almoſt over the whole Chriſtian World. I might add, if it was neceſſary, that the Genuineſs of this Text might be defended from it's Conection with the preceeding Verſes, and the Scope of the Place. But it's Time that I ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to propoſe a Method of diſcourſing upon the Subject our Text contains, which ſhall be as follows, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. I ſhall offer ſome Conſiderations ſerving to prove and explain <hi>a Trinity in the Godhead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. I ſhall labour to prove, by divers Arguments, <hi>their Unity therein, or that each of the ſacred Three is truly and properly God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. Anſwer the moſt <hi>important Objections.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then proceed to the Improvement of the whole.</p>
            <p>That there be Three in the Godhead the Scripture teaches ſo often as it makes mention of more who are God, and this is done in all thoſe Places wherein the Almighty ſpeaks of himſelf in the plural Number. (<hi>See Gen.</hi> i. 26. <hi>and</hi> iii. 22. <hi>and</hi> xi. 7.) <hi>Let us make Man, &amp;c.</hi> Neither is the Cavil of the modern Jews, reſpecting thoſe Places of Scripture, of any Validity, viz. That God ſpeaks to the Angels, or to the Heaven or Earth, or Elements, and calls them to a Partnerſhip in the Creation, or that he ſpeaks of himſelf alone after the Manner of great Men: But how Ridiculous is it to ſuppoſe that Angels, or any other
<pb n="427" facs="unknown:005500_0430_10396705C1DB8660"/>
Creature, ſhould be call'd to any Fellowſhip in Creation, which is a Work of Almighty Power, or that infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhould be nonplus'd, and need Council of Creatures! Neither does the Stile of the Modern great ones ſuit the Scriptures, or Cuſtom of the eaſtern Nations; it was two late receiv'd by the weſtern World to determine this Point! It may be further obſerv'd, that the aforeſaid Phraſe does not exactly agree with the Cuſtom of the Moderns; for they ſay not we Kings of <hi>England,</hi> or we <hi>George's,</hi> but <hi>we</hi> George <hi>the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides thoſe Places of Scripture whereby <hi>Jehovah</hi> is diſtinguiſh'd from <hi>Jehovah,</hi> do proclaim a Plurality of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the God-head (<hi>See Gen.</hi> xix. 24. <hi>Ex.</hi> xxxiv. 5. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> xii. 24.25.) Surely <hi>Jehovah</hi> is not diſtinguiſh'd from <hi>Jehovah</hi> by his Eſſence, ſeeing there is but one God; (<hi>Deut.</hi> vi. 4.) or by Accidents, for ſuch do not belong to the Almighty, and therefore the Diſtinction muſt be perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. A Trinity of Perſons is likewiſe ſignifi'd in thoſe Places of Scripture, where the Name of God is divers Times repeated in the ſame Sentence, which it would be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane to ſuppoſe was Tautological. (<hi>See Deut.</hi> vi. 4. <hi>Exo.</hi> iii. 15. <hi>Iſa.</hi> vi. 3.) <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord of Hoſts;</hi> but in the New-Teſtament this Truth is more expreſly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, <hi>Mat.</hi> iii. 16.17. <hi>And JESUS when he was Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd, went up ſtraitway out of the Water,</hi> (or as the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Word <hi>Apo,</hi> is elſewhere juſtly render'd by the ſame Interpreters <hi>from the Water) and lo the Heavens were open'd unto him, and he ſaw the Spirit of God deſending like a Dove and lighting upon him, and lo a Voice from Heaven, ſaying this is my belov'd Son in whom I am well pleas'd.</hi> This Place is ſo expreſs to the Point, that it was a common ſaying among the Antient Fathers, viz. <hi>Go to</hi> Jordan <hi>and you will ſee the Trinity,</hi> Mat. xxviii. 19. <hi>Go therefore teach all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="428" facs="unknown:005500_0431_10396703F24A9688"/>
in the Name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Surely we ſhould not be baptiz'd in the Name of one who is not God. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> xiii. 14. <hi>The Grace of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, and the Love of God, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Holy Ghoſt, be with you all Amen.</hi> Here three diſtinct Bleſſings are deſir'd for the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> from the ſacred Three in the God-head, namely, <hi>Love</hi> from the Father, <hi>Grace</hi> from the Son, and <hi>Communion</hi> from the Holy-Ghoſt. Now that thoſe ſacred Three are diſtinct Perſons, appears by the following Conſiderations, The Word <hi>Hypoſtaſis,</hi> ſignifies as much as Subſiſtence or Perſon, and this is expreſly apply'd to the Father, of which the Son is ſaid <hi>to be the expreſs Image, Heb.</hi> i. 3. And what can this intend but that he is a Perſon alſo? Now by a a Parity of Reaſon the ſame muſt be likewiſe ſaid of the Holy Ghoſt: But ſeeing the Father's perſonallity is not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, it will be only neceſſary to add ſomewhat concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Perſonality of the Son and Holy-Ghoſt. To this End it may be obſerv'd, that perſonal Characters are aſcrib'd to the ſecond Perſon of the Trinity: Hence he is call'd a <hi>Son,</hi> which denotes a diſtinct Perſon from the Father. He is likewiſe ſaid <hi>to be ſent into the World by his Father;</hi> which cannot, without the greateſt Impropriety, be apply'd to a mere Relation or Quality: He is likewiſe call'd a <hi>Surety &amp;c.</hi> And three Offices are aſcrib'd to him as ſuch, by each of which he is call'd. It may be alſo farther obſerv'd that ſome of the aforeſaid Characters are never aſcrib'd to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the other Perſons of the Trinity; beſides the Second, the Father and Holy Spirt, are never call'd the Son, are never ſaid to be made fleſh, or to become Sureties for periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tranſgreſſors: Not to add that the perſonal Characters, He, Thy, Thou, are apply'd to the Son. <hi>Pſ.</hi> cx. 7. <hi>He ſhall drink of the Brook in the Way.</hi> Verſe 3. <hi>Thy People
<pb n="429" facs="unknown:005500_0432_1039670251D29B58"/>
ſhall he willing in the Day of thy Power.</hi> V. 4. <hi>Thou art a Prieſt forever, after the Order of</hi> Melchizedeck.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, it appears likewiſe, that the Holy Ghoſt is a divine Perſon from the perſonal Properties aſcrib'd to him in Scripture, thus he is ſaid <hi>to act by ſovereign Pleaſure. Act.</hi> xv. 18. <hi>it ſeem'd good to the Holy Ghoſt and to us.</hi> He is alſo ſaid <hi>to conſtitute Officers in the Church of God. Act.</hi> xx. 28. <hi>Take heed therefore unto yourſelves, and to all the Flock, over the which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you overſeers.</hi> He is likewiſe ſaid <hi>to inſtruct them. Mark</hi> xiii. 11. <hi>To ſend them. Act.</hi> xiii, 4. <hi>To dwell in them.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. 19. See that famous Place of Scripture, <hi>Joh.</hi> viii. 16.17.18. What tho' in the poetical Parts of Scripture ſometimes perſonal Characters are aſcrib'd to Things which are not Perſons. It will not follow that many Hundreds of Places reſpecting the Trinity, where no lofty Expreſſion is us'd, ſhould be taken without any Neceſſity, without any Notice from the Context in the ſame Senſe. Surely fundamentals in Religion are plainly expreſs'd, and not perpetually immur'd and vail'd in Tropes and Figures, and ſo rendered inacceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to a vulgar Underſtanding, otherwiſe we ſhould be left to the greateſt Uncertainty in the moſt important and momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Points, notwithſtanding of the Revelation given us, which can hardly conſiſt with the Divine Goodneſs. If perſonal Characters, when apply'd to Men and Angels, are taken in a proper Senſe, why ſhould they not when ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to the ſacred Three, who tho' they have not diſtinct Beings, yet have an Underſtanding and Will, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are capable of Perſonality, and indeed to take the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid Places of Scripture, and all the reſt that relate to the Perſonallity of the Son and Holy Ghoſt in a figurative Senſe, manifeſtly tends to overthrow the Perſonallity of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is prov'd by the ſame Method's.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="430" facs="unknown:005500_0433_10396700418EF0E8"/>But to make the Way more plain, for what may be afterwards offered, it may be here obſerv'd, that by the Word <hi>Trinity,</hi> we mean no more, than that the divine Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, which is one, is common to three Perſons, namely, <hi>the Father, Son, and Spirit,</hi> who are diſtinguiſh'd by three Manners of ſubſiſting. Altho' the Word <hi>Trinity</hi> is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſly mentioned in Scripture, yet what is thereby ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is agreeable thereto, as appears from what has been, and what may be (God willing) farther offered, and therefore its proper that the Term be retain'd, until a better be found to ſupply the Room thereof. By Eſſence we underſtand what the Scriptures term the Nature of God, <hi>(Phuſis) Gal.</hi> vi. 8. the Form of God <hi>(Morphe) Phil.</hi> ii. the Godhead <hi>(Theotes) Coloſ.</hi> ii. 9. In ſhort the divine Eſſence is that whereby God, is God: For that whereby any Thing is what it is, is call'd its Eſſence. The Word Perſon or Subſiſtence (which is the ſame) is a ſcriptural Term, <hi>Heb.</hi> i. 3. Our Text affirms that there are <hi>Three that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Then there are three Somethings in the Godhead, but what are they, not three diſtinct Subſtances, or Eſſences, otherwiſe there would be unavoidably three Gods, which is blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous to imagine; not three Accidents, for theſe belong not to God, becauſe of his Simplicity and Immutability, not three Relations, for theſe cannot act or bear witneſs. What then can they be but Perſons? If any don't like this ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Name, let them produce a better if they can.</p>
            <p>The Word Perſon, ſome deſcribe to be <q>a rational in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable Subſtance.</q> And others, <q>an individual Subſiſtence of a rational Being.</q> A Beaſt is an individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, but without Reaſon, a Soul hath Reaſon, but is not an individual; and therefore neither of theſe can be a Perſon. Now every manner of Being makes a diſtinct Perſon in God, becauſe his Eſſence being indiviſible muſt be in every
<pb n="431" facs="unknown:005500_0434_103966FE8BF02AE8"/>
of them. An ingenious Writer repreſents a Perſon in the Trinity thus. viz. <q>That it is a ſpiritual infinite Agent, which muſt not be conſidered as abſtracted from, but as truly ſubſiſting in the divine Nature, and as mutually, eternally, and inſeparably related to the other co-eſſential Perſons in the Godhead, from whom he is ſufficiently and only diſtinguiſh'd by ſome Perſonal, and as ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable Properties.</q> As this Deſcription guards againſt the Hereſy of <hi>Sabellius</hi> on the one Hand, who ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined a divine Perſon to be but a Quality or Accident. So it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually militates againſt the <hi>Hereſie</hi> of the <hi>Tritheiſts</hi> who dream that the Perſons of the Trinity are three abſolute Beings that exiſt ſeparately, &amp; thus a Medium is opened, between two dangerous Extreams. It is neceſſary to retain the Word <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> reſpecting the Trinity, in order to ward off the <hi>Sabelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Error, which is, that the Diſtinction among the ſacred Three is only nominal, and that there is but one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; who becauſe of his different Operations, was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times called <hi>Father,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Son,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Holy-Ghoſt.</hi> Yet in the mean Time, it muſt be obſerv'd, that there is a wide Difference, between human and divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, in the following Reſpects, namely</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Human Perſons proceed from each other in Time, but whatever outward Order there be among the ſacred Three, yet there can be no Firſtneſs or Priority of Nature, Time or Dignity among them, they muſt be all co-equal and co-eternal, otherwiſe they could not be God.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. Human Perſons have their own proper Beings diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly from each other, and from every other Creature, but the Perſons of the Trinity have all one and the ſame Being or Eſſence. The Godhead of the <hi>Father, Son</hi> and <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> is the very ſame, otherwiſe there would be three Gods. Tho' one human Perſon is of the ſame Species with another,
<pb n="432" facs="unknown:005500_0435_103966FD05E60E38"/>
or has a Nature like the reſt of his own Order, yet it is not the ſame individual Nature which another poſſeſſes, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Faculties and Exerciſe thereof would be the very ſame in two Perſons, which is certainly falſe. But in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Godhead, tho' each Perſon be diſtinct from the other, yet each poſſeſſes the very ſame individual divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, otherwiſe each could not be ſaid to be truly and really God.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. Human Perſons are ſeparated from each other, one might be, tho' the other ſhould never exiſt: Created Beings are deriv'd precarious and dependant, whereas on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the Perſons of the Trinity have an In-being in one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>John</hi> xiv. 10. <hi>Believeſt thou not that I am in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Father in me?</hi> And undoubtedly they have a neceſſary Exiſtence, and independent Perſonality, otherwiſe each of them could not be infinitely perfect, and ſo not God.</p>
            <p>I ſhall here beg leave to mention Mr. <hi>Flavels</hi> Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Perſon of the Trinity, which I think is as ſafe and intelligible, as any that I have met with, which is this, viz. <q>That it is the Godhead diſtinguiſh'd by perſonal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, each Perſon having his diſtinct perſonal Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</q> (<hi>Heb.</hi> i. 3.) To explain which let the following Particulars be conſider'd. namely</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. That all the ſacred Three poſſeſs the ſame Godhead, and hence they are ſaid to <hi>be One</hi> in our Text; and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, that <hi>they are in each other,</hi> as has been but now mentioned, they have a Communion in the ſame Eſſence: Foraſmuch as the divine Eſſence is Infinite, it can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to more than one, and hence they muſt needs have Commuion in the ſame eſſential Attributes, ſuch as Omnicience, Almightineſs, Eternity, Self-exiſtence. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever perſonal Self-exiſtence does peculiarly belong to the
<pb n="433" facs="unknown:005500_0436_103966FB84BF9F38"/>
               <hi>Father, (John</hi> v. 26.) Yet an eſſential Self-Exiſtence, muſt belong to all the ſacred Three, that is, the Son and Spirit muſt be of themſelves, as well as the Father, otherwiſe they could not be God, and from this Communion in Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Attributes, neceſſarily reſults a Communion in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Worſhip, which equally belongs to all. (<hi>John</hi> v. 23.)</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. The Godhead is diſtinguiſh'd, not divided, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Eſſence being ſimple and infinite, is therefore indiviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble into more of the ſame Kind, but tho' it cannot be divided, yet it may be diſtinguiſh'd by perſonal Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>Now the Perſonal Property of the Father, <hi>is to beget the Son,</hi> Pſ. ii. 7. <hi>I will declare the Decree, the Lord hath ſaid unto me, thou art my Son this Day have I begotten thee,</hi> Eph. i. 3. <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, who hath bleſſed us with all ſpiritual Bleſſings, in Heavenly Places in CHRIST.</hi> Begetting is not an Eſſential Act, otherwiſe it would be common to all, but we do not find that it is common to all, the Son is never ſaid in Scripture to beget the Father, or the Holy Ghoſt the Son; and therefore the Act is Perſonal, on this Account altho' the Father cannot be called properly the Fountain of the Deity, yet he is by ſome call'd the Original of the Perſons.</p>
            <p>That the Generation of the Son was eternal, is evident from the following Places of Scripture, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> iii. 14, 15. <hi>For this Cauſe I bow my Knees unto the Father of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, of whom the whole Family in Heaven and Earth is named,</hi> Prov. viii. 22, 24. <hi>The Lord poſſeſſed me in the Beginning of his Way, before his Works of Old. I was ſet up from Everlaſting.—Or ever the Earth was, when there was no Depths I was brought forth, while as yet he had not made the Earth.</hi> Mic. v. 2. <hi>Whoſe Goings forth have been from of Old, even from Everlaſting.</hi> See alſo <hi>Pſ.</hi> ii. 7. The
<pb n="434" facs="unknown:005500_0437_103966F9B2BE7698"/>
eternal Generation of the Son is confirm'd by the Titles gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to him in Scripture, thus he is call'd abſolutely the <hi>Son of God (Mat.</hi> xvi. 16.) <hi>A Son begotten by God</hi> (Acts iv. 25, 26.) <hi>His own Son.</hi> (Rom. viii. 32.) <hi>The firſt begotten Son.</hi> (Heb. i. vi.) <hi>The only begotten Son</hi> (John i. 14.) This eternal Generation ſome Godly and learned Divines ſay, "conſiſts in the Communication of the ſame Eſſence." <hi>John</hi> v. 26. And others, <q>in the Communication of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonality.</q> Or in other Words, <q>That the Perſon of the Father, begat the Perſon of the Son from Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ineffably, but undividedly.</q> Altho' it is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neceſſary inviolably to maintain the eternal Generation of the Son, becauſe it is aſſerted by Scripture and Antiquity, and the Denial of it ſeems to have a bad Tendency to weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en our Belief of the Doctrine of the Trinity, by oppoſing the perſonal Properties of the Father and Son, which are the principal Ground of the Diſtinction between thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perſons. Yet we muſt confeſs with <hi>Juſtin,</hi> and a Cloud of other Witneſſes, that the Manner thereof is incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible, and inexpreſſible. And hence the Antient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were wont to ſay concerning it, <q>That it was incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible, without the Viciſſitude of Time, without Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, and without Change or Paſſion, either in the Father or Son.</q> 
               <hi>Prov.</hi> viii. 22, 23. <hi>Mic.</hi> v. 2. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> i. 17. <hi>John</hi> i. 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> xiv. 10, 11. Which they expreſs'd in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Words, <hi>acataleptoos, achronoos, achoriſtoos, apathoos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Second Perſon of the Trinity, is only the Son of God, on the Account of his eternal Generation, altho' his Sonſhip be manifeſted by his Incarnation, <hi>Rom.</hi> i. And hence he is call'd <hi>the Brightneſs of his Fathers Glory, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Image of his Perſon,</hi> Heb. i. 3. Coloſ. i. 15. He is ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Son of the Father, in a Senſe different from any meer Creature in Heaven or Earth, otherwiſe he could not
<pb n="435" facs="unknown:005500_0438_103966F8089C50B0"/>
be call'd <hi>the only begotten Son of God, and equal to God.</hi> Phil. ii. 6. And therefore it muſt be by eternal Generation: He had the Character of a Son before he aſſum'd human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. (<hi>John</hi> iii. 16.) And therefore that Aſſumption could not be the Cauſe of his Sonſhip, to ſuppoſe that the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Lord, is the Cauſe of his Sonſhip, is to deſtroy the Paternal Relation of the firſt Perſon to him: For thus the third Perſon might be call'd his Father as well as the Firſt; and as to the ſeeming Abſurdities that are objected, it may be in general replied, that thoſe take Place only in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Generations, not ſupernatural.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, the perſonal Property of the Son, is to <hi>be begotten by the Father,</hi> Prov. viii. 24, 25. John i. 14. <hi>We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held his Glory, the Glory, as of the only begotten of the Father.</hi> Heb. i. 5. <hi>For unto which of the Angels ſaid he at any Time, thou art my Son, this Day have I begotten thee.</hi> As <hi>active Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration</hi> is the Manner of the Fathers ſubſiſting, ſo <hi>paſſive Generation</hi> is the Manner of the Son's.</p>
            <p>Again, the perſonal Property of the Holy Ghoſt is, <hi>to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the Father and the Son,</hi> John xiv. 26. <hi>But the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter which is the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will ſend in my Name, he ſhall teach you all Things.</hi> And chap. xv. 16. <hi>But when the Comforter is come, whom I will ſend unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of Truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he ſhall teſtify of me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus it appears that the ſacred Three are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd by their perſonal Properties; and by the Order of ſubſiſting, and acting conſequent thereupon.</p>
            <p>The perſonal Properties ſhew that they are ſo diſtinguiſh'd, that one cannot be the other. The Father cannot be the Son, or the Son the Father, <hi>Yet he that hath ſeen the Son, hath ſeen the Father alſo.</hi> John xiv. 9. As to the Order of their ſubſiſting, the Father is the firſt Perſon, who ſubſiſts entirely of himſelf, the Son the ſecond Perſon, begotten by
<pb n="436" facs="unknown:005500_0439_103966F662DD27D8"/>
Father, the Spirit is the Third, who proceeds from both the Father and Son. This Order ſhould not be inverted, tho' in the mean Time we muſt not conceive that there is any real Priority, as to <hi>Nature, Time,</hi> or <hi>Dignity</hi> but of order only, in reſpect of their Original. The Father conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd as ſuch, is firſt in order before his Son, but the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Generation of the Son, and Proceſſion of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, is to us, as has been before obſerv'd, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible! Hence is that of the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> liii 8. <hi>Who ſhall declare his Generation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again the Perſons of the Trinity are diſtinguiſh'd, as was before hinted, by their Order of acting, which is agreeable to that of their ſubſiſting, the Father worketh of himſelf, by the Son and Holy Ghoſt, the Son from the Father, by the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit from the Father and Son, by himſelf, <hi>John</hi> xvi. 13. <hi>Howheit when the Spirit of Truth is come, he will guide you into all Truth, for he ſhall not ſpeak of himſelf, but whatſoever he ſhall hear, that ſhall he ſpeak.</hi> John v. 19. <hi>Then anſwered Jeſus and ſaid unto him, verily verily I ſay unto you, the Son can do nothing of himſelf, but what he ſeeth the Father do, for what Things ſoever he doth, theſe alſo doth he likewiſe.</hi> Undoubtedly the Power of working is only one, and therefore common to all the Three, but the Order and Object of working is different; and hence the firſt Work, namely Creation, is aſcrib'd to the Firſt Perſon; and the ſecond Work, viz. Redemtion to the Second; and the Third Work, namely, Sanctification to the third Perſon of the Trinity. This by many Divines is termed the OEconomy of the Perſons of the Godhead; which may be thus deſcrib'd, viz. <hi>That it is ſuch an Order of acting, as directly tends to manifeſt the perſonal Glory of the Father Son and Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho' all the Works of God, are aſcrib'd to every Perſon of the Trinity, becauſe all the divine Attributes equally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
<pb n="437" facs="unknown:005500_0440_103966F4DF2C02D0"/>
to them, and therefore every Work muſt be equally produc'd by them. Yet ſeeing there are diſtinct Perſons in the Godhead, it is but reaſonable that their perſonal Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhould be peculiarly Manifeſted. Now this the ſacred Scripture Points to, by that different Order of acting, which it aſcribes to the ſacred Three. Hence the Work of our Salvation in reſpect of its <hi>Projection,</hi> is firſt aſſign'd to the Father, in regard of its <hi>Purchaſe</hi> to the Son, and in reſpect of its <hi>Application</hi> to the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>It is of the laſt neceſſity that under this Head, we care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully avoid <hi>Sabellianiſm</hi> on the one Hand, which allows of no Diſtinction among the Perſons of the Trinity, but what is meerly nominal, and aſſerts that one and the ſame Perſon becauſe of his different Operations, is ſometimes called Father, ſometimes Son, and ſometimes Holy Spirit, and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that we with equal Care avoid the <hi>Tritheiſm</hi> of <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus,</hi> who deem'd that there were Three eternal Spirits, unequal to each other, and different in Eſſence, and ſo by conſequence that there were three Gods: Some to avoid the Hereſy of <hi>Sabellius,</hi> have held that the Perſons of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty differ from each other <hi>really,</hi> but that ſeeming to verge to Tritheiſm, others to avoid that extream, have held that they only differ <hi>modally,</hi> as one manner from another, but ſome thinking that the modal Diſtinction, is too ſuperficial and that it verges to <hi>Sabellianiſm</hi> do obſerve, that the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction is <hi>real-Modal,</hi> this ſeems to guard beſt againſt both Extreams. But if thoſe ſcholaſtick Diſtinctions do not ſatisfy, it will be enough to ſay, that the Perſons of the Trinity dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer as Three, or that they are ſo diſtinguiſhed, by perſonal Properties, that the one cannot be the other.</p>
            <p>Here I ſhall beg leave to cite the Words of famous Mr. <hi>How,</hi> in his Diſcourſe upon the Trinity, pag. 540 which run thus, <q>Since therefore there is a Neceſſity apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of acknowledging three ſuch Somewhats in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
<pb n="438" facs="unknown:005500_0441_103966F35D51EF88"/>
both becauſe the Word of God, who beſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands his own Nature, doth ſpeak of three in it, ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that without notorious Violence, it cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood otherwiſe, and becauſe it affirms ſome Things of one, or other of them, which it affirms not of the reſt, it will therefore be neceſſary to admit a true Diſtinction between them, otherwiſe they can't be three, and ſafe to ſay, there is ſo much, as is requiſite to found the diſtinct Affirmations which we find in God's Word concerning this or that apart from the other, otherwiſe we ſhall in Effect deny what God affirms; and modeſt to confeſs, that how great the Diſtinction is, with preciſe and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Limitation, we do not know, nor dare we enquire or determine; only that as it cannot be leſs then is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſuſtain ſuch diſtinct Predicates or Attributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo it cannot be ſo great, as to intrench upon the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Godhead.</q> Thus far he</p>
            <p>It may be here added, that the Perſons of the Trinity are diſtinguiſh'd from the Eſſence, as one from Three, or as that which is communicable from that which is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable. I proceed to the</p>
            <p n="2">2d. Propos'd, which was to prove <hi>the Unity of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Three, in the Godhead. And theſe Three are One,</hi> One God equal in Power and Glory. There is no need of ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Time in attempting to prove the Godhead of the Father, ſeeing it is queſtioned by none but Atheiſts. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proceed to prove the Godhead of the Son; which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from this, that all the Peculiars of Divinity are aſcrib'd to him, as is evident from the following Induction of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, viz.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. The <hi>Names of God</hi> are aſcrib'd to him: Thus he is call'd <hi>God. Heb.</hi> i. 8. <hi>But unto the Son he ſayeth, thy Throne O God is for ever and ever, likewiſe the mighty God. (Iſa.</hi> ix. 6.) <hi>The True God.</hi> (1 <hi>Joh,</hi> v. 20.) <hi>God Bleſſed forever.
<pb n="439" facs="unknown:005500_0442_103966F1B6E3AA90"/>
(Rom.</hi> ix. 5.) <hi>The Lord of Glory.</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ii. 8.) <hi>Lord of Lords, and King of Kings. (Rev.</hi> xvii. 14.) The Name <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah</hi> appears to be the peculiar Name of God. <hi>Pſ.</hi> lxxxiii. 18. <hi>That thou whoſe Name alone is</hi> Jehovah, <hi>art the moſt high over all the Earth. Exo.</hi> iii. 14 <hi>Thus ſhalt thou ſay to the Children of</hi> Iſrael, I AM (<hi>or</hi> Jehovah) <hi>hath ſent me unto you; this is my Memorial unto all Generations.</hi> Now that the Name <hi>Jehovah</hi> is aſcrib'd to the ſecond Perſon of the Trinity, appears from the following Places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>viz. (Numb.</hi> xxi. 5.6.7.) There the People, after the awful Judgment of the fiery Serpents was ſent among them, confeſs'd that they had ſin'd againſt the Lord, or <hi>Jehovah.</hi> Now this Paſſage we find expreſly apply'd to CHRIST by the Apoſtle in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> x. 9. <hi>Neither let us tempt Chriſt as ſome of them alſo tempted, and were deſtroyed of the Serpents, Iſa.</hi> xl. 3. <hi>The Voice of him that cryeth in the Wilderneſs, pepare the Way of the Lord, or</hi> Jehovah, <hi>make ſtrait in the Deſart a high Way for our God.</hi> (See this apply'd to Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> iii. 3.11.) Another notable Place of Scripture to the ſame Purpoſe is, <hi>Iſa.</hi> vi. 1.2. <hi>Mine Eyes have ſeen the King the Lord, or</hi> Jehovah: This is likewiſe apply'd to CHRIST, <hi>Joh.</hi> xii. 40.41. Our Lord likewiſe aſſumes the Name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> as appears by his telling the <hi>Jews</hi> thus, <hi>before</hi> Abraham <hi>was,</hi> I AM; many other Proofs might be brought, but what have been mention'd, if duly conſider'd, may, I hope, ſuffice. But</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. The <hi>Attributes of God</hi> are aſcrib'd to CHRIST, as particularly,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>Omniciency,</hi> John. xxi. 17. <hi>Lord thou knoweſt all Things.</hi> And elſewhere it is ſaid, that <hi>he knew from the Beginning who they were that believed not, and who ſhould betray him. John.</hi> vi. 64. and <hi>John</hi> ii. 24.25. It is ſaid,
<pb n="440" facs="unknown:005500_0443_103966F01175A678"/>
JESUS <hi>did not commit himſelf unto them, becauſe he knew all Men, and needed not that any ſhould teſtify of Man, for he knew what was in Man.</hi> Beſides, <hi>Rev.</hi> ii. 23. He is ſaid <hi>to ſearch the Reins and Heart.</hi> Such Knowledge as this, is ſurely beyond the Reach of Men and Angels.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) <hi>Omnipotency</hi> is aſcrib'd to CHRIST, <hi>Rev.</hi> i. 8. <hi>I am the</hi> Alpha <hi>and</hi> Omega, <hi>the Beginning and Ending, ſayeth the Lord, which is, which was, which is to come, the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty. Philip.</hi> iii. 21. <hi>Whereby he is able to ſubdue all Things to himſelf:</hi> And hence he is call'd <hi>the mighty God,</hi> and ſaid <hi>to uphold all Things by his Power. (Iſ.</hi> xi. 6. <hi>Heb.</hi> i. 3.)</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) <hi>Eternity</hi> is aſcrib'd to CHRIST: And hence he is call'd <hi>the Everlaſting Father. (Iſ.</hi> ix. 6.) And ſaid <hi>to live for ever and ever. (Rev.</hi> x. 6.) And that <hi>his goings forth have been from of Old, from Everlaſting. (Mic.</hi> v. 2.)</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) <hi>Omnipreſence</hi> is likewiſe aſcrib'd to CHRIST. <hi>Mat.</hi> xviii. 20. <hi>Where two or three are gather'd together in my Name there am I in the midſt of them;</hi> this is a manifeſt Evidence of the God-head of our Lord; for ſurely a Creature cannot be in two Places at once. To imagine that the aforeſaid Place of Scripture intends only the Preſence of our Lords Authority, is to ſuppoſe a Tautology in the Words which is abſurd; for to be <hi>gather'd together in his Name,</hi> ſignifies his Authority: ſurely it is but reaſonable to take this Place of Scripture, in the ſame Senſe with that Parallel one, <hi>Exo.</hi> xx. 24. <hi>In all Places where I record my Name, I will come unto thee, and I will bleſs thee.</hi> See likewiſe Matt. xxviii. ult. <hi>Lo I am with you always unto the End of the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">(5.) <hi>Independency</hi> is aſcrib'd to CHRIST. <hi>Rev.</hi> i. 8.17. <hi>I am</hi> Alpha <hi>and</hi> Omega, <hi>the Beginning and Ending ſayeth the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency is likewiſe imply'd in the name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> which is given to CHRIST; as has been prov'd before.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="441" facs="unknown:005500_0444_103966EE6B3084C0"/>(6.) <hi>Equality with God</hi> is likewiſe aſcrib'd to Chriſt: And hence it is ſaid, <hi>that he was in the form of God, and thought it no Robery to be equal with God. Philip.</hi> ii. 5.6.7. For this Reaſon he is juſtly call'd <hi>the Fellow of God.</hi> Zec. xiii. 7. And all that the Father hath are ſaid to be his. (<hi>Joh.</hi> xvi. xv.)</p>
            <p n="7">(7.) <hi>Immutability in Eſſence</hi> is aſcrib'd to our Lord. <hi>Pſ.</hi> cii, 27, 28. <hi>But thou art the ſame and thy Years ſhall have no End, the Children of thy Servants ſhall continue, and their Seed ſhall be eſtabliſh'd before thee.</hi> Compar'd with <hi>Heb.</hi> i. 12. <hi>As a Veſture thou ſhalt fold them up, and they ſhall be changed, but thou art the ſame, and thy Years ſhall not fail.</hi> And in a Word there is no Attribute belongs to the Father, but what is alſo aſcrib'd to the Son. Again</p>
            <p n="3">3dly the <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>God</hi> are aſcrib'd to CHRIST, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) The Work of <hi>Creation,</hi> Joh. i. 3. <hi>All Things were made by him, and without him was not any Thing made that was made. Col.</hi> i. 16. <hi>For by him were all Things created that are in Heaven and that are in Earth, viſible and inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> Now Creation is certainly a Work which requires Almighty Strength, a Work which none but a God can perform.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The Work of <hi>Providence</hi> is attributed to our Lord: And hence it is ſaid, that <hi>by him all Things conſiſt, and are upheld by the Word of his Power. (Col.</hi> i. 17. and <hi>Heb.</hi> i. 3.) Theſe words of our Lord to the <hi>Jews John</hi> v. 17. are applicable to the ſame Purpoſe, <hi>viz, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) <hi>Miraculous Works</hi> are aſcrib'd to CHRIST, <hi>John.</hi> v. 21. <hi>For as the Father raiſeth up the Dead, and quickneth them, even ſo the Son quickneth whom he will.</hi> An Inſtance of this we have <hi>John</hi> xi. 43, 44. Where we are told that our Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="442" facs="unknown:005500_0445_103966ECC7343148"/>
               <hi>Lazarus to come forth,</hi> after he had been four Days dead, and that this was immediately obey'd, <hi>the dead came forth, bound Hand and Foot, with grave Cloths.</hi> Our Lord likewiſe rais'd himſelf from the Dead. (<hi>John</hi> x. 18.) Many other Inſtances might be produc'd, but I muſt not perſiſt.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> are in like Manner attributed to the Lord JESUS; ſuch as,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>Election,</hi> John xiii. 18, <hi>I ſpeak not of you all, I know whom I have choſen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) <hi>Juſtification, Iſa.</hi> liii. 11. <hi>By his Knowledge ſhall my righteous Servant juſtify many,</hi> Mat. ix. 6. <hi>But that ye may know that the Son of Man hath Power on Earth to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) <hi>Regeneration,</hi> Epheſ. ii. 1. <hi>And you hath be quickned who were dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins.</hi> And hence CHRIST is ſaid <hi>to be the Author and Finiſher of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">(4.) <hi>Salvation,</hi> Mat. i. 21. <hi>And ſhall bring forth a Son, and thou ſhalt call his name</hi> JESUS, <hi>for he ſhall ſave his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from their Sins.</hi> Hence he is call'd <hi>the Captain of our Salvation;</hi> and we are told that <hi>in his Name alone Happineſs is to be had, Act.</hi> iv. 12. To what has been ſaid under this Head, we may add our Lords <hi>Miſſion of the Holy-Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Inſtitution of ſacred Ordinances,</hi> Joh. xvi. 7. <hi>If I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you, but if I depart I will ſend him unto you.</hi> Mat. xxviii. 18.19. <hi>All Power is given unto me in Heaven and Earth. Go therefore and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son and Holy-Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4thly. The <hi>Worſhip due to God only</hi> is aſcrib'd to CHRIST: And hence Men are enjoyned to <hi>honour the Son even as they honour the Father, Joh.</hi> v. 22.23. Particularly</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) We are enjoyn'd to <hi>adore</hi> him, Heb. i. 6. <hi>And when he bringeth in the firſt Begotten into the World, he ſayeth,

            <p n="3">(3.) We are to be <hi>baptis'd</hi> in his Name, as well as in the Name of the Father. <hi>Mat.</hi> xviii. 19.</p>
            <p>Again I add, that our Lord did aſſert his Godhead in divers Conferrences with the <hi>Jews. (See John</hi> v. 16. to the 19th. Verſe.) The <hi>Jews</hi> ſought to ſlay him, becauſe he made himſelf equal with God. Now our Lord does not in Anſwer hereto endeavour to clear himſelf of that Charge; which ſurely he would have done had he not been God, otherwiſe he would be Guilty of the greateſt Impiety. When the People of <hi>Lyſtra</hi> attempted to worſhip <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas, they rent their Cloaths, and ran among them, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out Sirs, why do ye theſe Things? We alſo are Men of like Paſſions with you, Act.</hi> xiv. 14.15. But our Saviour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of rejecting the Charge, notwithſtanding of ſome Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages that reſpect his human Nature, aſſerts his Divinity, by ſhewing that <hi>he quickned whom he pleas'd, as well as the Father;</hi> likewiſe that <hi>all Judgment was committed to him,</hi> and that <hi>all Men ſhould honour him as they honour the Father;</hi> that <hi>he had Life in himſelf, and ſhould raiſe the Dead at the laſt Day.</hi> At another Time, <hi>Joh.</hi> viii. 53. to 58. After the <hi>Jews</hi> had enquir'd, <hi>art thou greater than our Father</hi> Abraham?— He reply'd, <hi>your Father</hi> Abraham <hi>rejoyc'd to ſee my Day, and he ſaw it and was glad. Then ſaid the</hi> Jews <hi>unto him, thou art not yet fifty Years Old, and haſt
<pb n="444" facs="unknown:005500_0447_103966E995A5C750"/>
thou ſeen</hi> Abraham: To this our Lord anſwered, <hi>before</hi> Abraham <hi>was, I</hi> AM! At this Time the <hi>Jews</hi> were enrag'd, and took up Stones to throw at him, ſuppoſing that he had ſpoken Blaſphemy, in preferring himſelf to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and making himſelf equal to God. It is certain that being ſton'd to Death, was a Penalty denounc'd by the judicial Law againſt Blaſphemers; the aforeſaid Sentence of our Lord, ſeems to be Parallel with that of the Prophet, reſpecting the the Eternity of God, <hi>viz. Iſa.</hi> xliii. 13. <hi>Yea before the Day was, I</hi> AM <hi>he.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another very memorable Conference we have, <hi>Mat.</hi> ix. from the 2d. to the 6th. Verſe. Our Lord declar'd to one ſick of the Palſy, that <hi>his Sins were forgiven him;</hi> on which Occaſion the <hi>Scribes</hi> murmured, and charged him with <hi>Blaſphemy.</hi> JESUS knowing their Thoughts reply'd, <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore think ye Evil in your Hearts? For whether is it eaſier to ſay, thy Sins be forgiven thee, or to ſay ariſe and walk; but that ye may know the Son of Man hath Power on Earth to forgive Sins, he ſayeth to the Perſon Sick of the Palſy, take up thy Bed, and go into thine Houſe.</hi> Proving by this Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle his Divinity; which they oppos'd, and conſequently his Power to forgive Sins.</p>
            <p>Tho' Miracles do not argue the Divinity of the Perſon that Works them from any viſible Circumſtance contain'd in them; yet they effectualy prove it, in Caſe this be the Thing conteſted, and an explicite Appeal be made to the divine Power to confirm it by Miracles.</p>
            <p>Our Lord had at the aforeſaid Conference as good an Opportunity, and as loud a Call as could be deſir'd to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim all Pretence to Divinity, if the Caſe was really ſo; but inſtead of this he aſſerts and proves his Godhead, maugre the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rage, which Practice could not conſiſt with Integrity if he were not God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="445" facs="unknown:005500_0448_1039640D3805CFE8"/>And now I ſhall proceed to offer a few practical Reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſo conclude at preſent. And 1ſt. What has been ſaid informs us of the following Particulars, <hi>viz.</hi> 1ſt. Of the true <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Manner</hi> of worſhiping God, and that is in the Son and by the Spirit, Joh. xvi. 23. <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall aſk the Father in my Name, he will give it you. Epheſ.</hi> vi. 18. <hi>Praying allways with all Prayer and Supplication in the Spirit.</hi> Surely it is by the Son, we ſhould come to the Father in our Supplications, and hence CHRIST is call'd <hi>the Way, John</hi> xix. 6. And we are ſaid to <hi>have Boldneſs to enter into the Holieſt by the Blood of</hi> JESUS <hi>by a new or liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Way, which he hath conſecrated for us, that is to ſay his Fleſh, Heb.</hi> x. 19, 20. Thoſe are therefore to be ſuſpected as Guilty of the Hereſy of <hi>Sabellius,</hi> who do not according to the Scriptures, ordinarily come to the Father by the Son in their Prayers, but uſually addreſs the Son, as tho' he were the Father, and do not give to each of the ſacred Three, their diſtinct perſonal Glory in their Acts of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but ſo frequently addreſs the Son, as if there were no other Perſon but he in the Trinity.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, How <hi>Happy</hi> is the <hi>State</hi> of all regenerate Perſons who have this three—one <hi>God,</hi> in all his Glory and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency for their ſure Portion here, (<hi>Jer.</hi> xxxi. 33.) and ſhall be continually delighted, with beholding the diſtinct Benefits receiv'd from each of the ſacred Three hereafter. <hi>Rev.</hi> i. 5. <hi>And from</hi> JESUS CHRIST, <hi>the Faithful Witneſs unto him that lov'd us, and waſhed us from our Sins in his Blood.</hi> And does it not increaſe their Felicity, that the Charter of the Holy Scripture, by which the aforeſaid Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made over, is confirm'd by the united Teſtimony of the ſacred Trinity from Heaven, as our Text informs us, <hi>There are Three that bear record in Heaven, and theſe Three are One.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="446" facs="unknown:005500_0449_103966E7D4674828"/>3dly. How much ſhould our <hi>Souls be affected</hi> by thinking on the Fathers Love, in giving his Son to be a Propitiation for our Sins. Herein is Love, indeed without Peer or Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel, (<hi>John</hi> iv. 10.) in that a Son was given for worthleſs Rebels, to Shame, Miſery and Death it ſelf, of the moſt hideous Kind! A Son not by Creation as the Angels, nor by Adoption as Believers, but by eternal Generation. His <hi>own, beloved, dear, only begotten Son, in whom he was well pleas'd. (Rom.</hi> viii. 32. <hi>Mat.</hi> iii. 17. <hi>Col.</hi> i. 13. <hi>Joh.</hi> i. 14.18.) And that to prevent the eternal Periſhing of poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. (<hi>Joh.</hi> iii. 16.)</p>
            <p>And what ſhall we ſay of the Kindneſs of the Son of God, in ſtooping ſo low to ſave guilty Worms from eternal Woe and Ruin; tho' he had the Form of God, yet he willingly aſſum'd the Form of a Servant, that we might be made the Sons of God. He that had the Heavens for his Throne, was contented with a Manger for his Cradle; tho' he was Rich he became Poor, that we thro' his Poverty might be made Rich; was crown'd with Thorns; endur'd the Death of the Croſs, and was laid in the Boſom of the Grave; that we might be crown'd with immortal Glory, deliver'd from the ſecond Death, and embrac'd in the Boſom of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Boſom of God.</p>
            <p>And how much ſhould we be affected, likewiſe with the Kindneſs of the Holy Spirit in enlightning our Minds, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing and comforting our Hearts by his divine Influences, without which we could have no ſpecial Benefit by the Death of CHRIST, no Communion with God here; or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of him in a future World.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, me thinks the Conſideration of the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Son of God, is one of the moſt pregnant and powerful Incentives poſſible to Admiration, Love, Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Obedience: How ſublime the Theme? How ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing
<pb n="447" facs="unknown:005500_0450_103966E650532F18"/>
the Thought that the eternal Father ſhould give his co-equal Son, the darling of his Soul, out of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of his Boſom, to bleed a Victom on the accurſed Tree, to purchaſe Peace, Pardon and Life for worthleſs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels! O the amazing Heights, the interminable Depths of this ſtupenduous dear Affection! This is Love infinitely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing the narrow Bounds of human Thought or Language. Love that none but a God is equal to! And how Strange, is it that the bleſſed God ſhould become incarnate, the Antient of Days become an Infant of Time, the Majeſty of Heaven ſtoop to aſſume the Infirmities of Humanity! O my Brethren! did not reſt himſelf become weary to give the weary Reſt? And the Fountain of Conſolation <hi>become a Man of Sorrows,</hi> to bring his People to unceaſing Joys and Triumphs!</p>
            <p>When we contemplate upon the Dignity of the Perſon of the Son of God, together with the Depth and Deſign of his Abaſure, what can more powerfully conſtrain us to Humility and Affection, both to God and Man! For therein we may behold the great God deſending from his Throne, to teach us thoſe amiable Vertues by his own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, as well as the Excellency of univerſal Obedience to the divine Law. The Godhead of CHRIST beautifies all the Inſtances of his Abaſure with the moſt tranſcendant Charms, unrivald Ornaments, and amiable Atractives! This is the Object of our Adoration and religion Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; this fires our Affections, and is the Foundation of our Hopes; this, this ſtrikes the Springs of our Ingenuity and Gratitude, and raiſes our admiring Thoughts into Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſy and Raviſhment! While we with Attention view the inutterable, unparallel'd, and incomprehenſible Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of divine Affection in the Mediation of the Son of God! But if with the <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Arians</hi> we deny his proper
<pb n="448" facs="unknown:005500_0451_103966E4A9BED038"/>
Deity, our Admiration ceaſes, our Love Languiſhes, and our Devotion dies for the Gift of a meer Creature: And his Sufferings are inconſiderable Things, not worthy to be once mention'd, in Compariſon of the Gift, and Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcention of a God! The Object of our Worſhip is removed; the Ground of our Hopes unhing'd, and the whole Scene of the Goſpel deſtroy'd at a Stroke. Dreadful Thought!</p>
            <p>Let us therefore be entreated equally to love, honour, and obey each Perſon of the ſacred Trinity. Let <hi>all Men honour the Son, as they honour the Father, John</hi> v. 23. Our Lord as Man obey'd his Father, and how much more ſhould we. (<hi>Joh.</hi> iv. 34.) Let us alſo <hi>kiſs the Son leaſt he be Angry, and we periſh from the Way; and ſeeing the Spirit of God hath made us. Job.</hi> xxxiii. 4. Why ſhould not he be ador'd by us.</p>
            <p>But the Time being elaps'd I muſt conclude, in the mean while aſcribing all Glory to the Trinity in Unity, and Unity in Trinitiy; the Three in One, and One in Three; the Father, Word and Spirit, let Men and Angels ſay <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>THE Doctrine of the ever bleſſed Trinity, is purely an Object of Faith. The Line of Reaſon is too ſhort to fathom this Myſtery, and therefore where Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon cannot wade, there Faith muſt ſwim, but tho' this ſublime Foundation Doctrine, be above Reaſon, yet it is not contrary to it. This I think the learned Mr. <hi>How,</hi> has made evident in his Diſcourſe upon the Poſſibility of a Trinity in the Godhead. In my laſt Diſcourſe upon the Doctrine of the Trinity, you may remember that I propos'd the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Method, viz.
<list>
                  <item>I. I was to offer ſome Conſiderations ſerving to confirm and explain it.</item>
                  <item>II. I was to prove by divers Arguments, the Unity of the ſacred Three, or that each of them is truly and really God, And</item>
                  <item>III. I propos'd to anſwer the moſt important Objections, and then proceed to the Improvement of the Whole.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt general Head was diſcuſs'd, and under the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, I offered what Arguments I judg'd ſufficient to prove the Godhead of the Son. It remains now that I prove the Godhead of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="450" facs="unknown:005500_0453_103966E154139A48"/>This I think is evident not only from his Being number'd with divine Perſons, as one with them as our Text aſſerts; but alſo from this Conſideration, that all the Peculiars of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity are aſcrib'd to him, as well as to the Father and Son, which will be manifeſt by the following Induction of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, namely</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. <hi>Divine Names</hi> are aſcrib'd to him, thus he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſly called <hi>God, Act</hi> v. 3, 4. Peter <hi>ſaid,</hi> Ananias, <hi>why hath Satan fill'd thine Heart to lie to the Holy Ghoſt, thou haſt not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto Men, but unto God.</hi> He is likewiſe called <hi>Lord:</hi> Now the Lord is that Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberby, here it may be obſerv'd, that the <hi>Seventy</hi> Interpreters generally render the Name <hi>Jehovah</hi> by that of <hi>Lord (Kurios)</hi> he is alſo called <hi>Jehovah</hi> as appears by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring <hi>Iſa.</hi> vi. 8, 9. <hi>Alſo I heard the Voice of the Lord ſaying, and who will go for us, then ſaid I, here am I, ſend me, and he ſaid go and tell this People hear ye indeed, but underſtand not, and ſee ye indeed, but perceive not.</hi> Now it is plain, that it is the Lord or Jehovah that ſpeaks in this Place of Scripture, but this we find expreſſly apply'd to the Holy Ghoſt <hi>Acts.</hi> xxviii. 25, 26. <hi>well ſpake the Holy Ghoſt, by</hi> Eſaias <hi>the Prophet unto our Fathers, ſaying, go unto this People, and ſay, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ye ſhall hear, and ſhall not underſtand, and ſeeing ye ſhall ſee and not perceive.</hi> The ſame Truth appears by compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Ex.</hi> xvii. 7. <hi>And he called the Name of the Place Maſſah and Meribah becauſe they tempted the Lord, or Jehovah,</hi> this we find apply'd to the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> iii. 7, 8. <hi>Wherefore as the Holy Ghoſt ſayeth—harden not your Hearts, as in the Provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Day of Temptation in the Wilderneſs, when your Fathers tempted me, prov'd me and ſaw my Works.</hi> More Proofs of the Name <hi>Jehovah</hi> aſcrib'd to the Holy Ghoſt, we have in the following Places of Scripture, viz. <hi>Jer.</hi> xxxi. 31. compar'd with <hi>Heb.</hi> x. 15, 16. <hi>Levit.</hi> xvi. 2 compar'd with <hi>Heb.</hi> ix. 78.</p>

            <p n="2">2dly. <hi>Almightineſs</hi> and independent Power, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 4, 6, 11. <hi>Now there are diverſity of Gifts, but the ſame Spirit, but it is the ſame God which worketh all in all, but all theſe worketh, that one and the ſelf ſame Spirit, dividing to every one ſeverally as he will.</hi> Compare <hi>Luk.</hi> xi. 20. with <hi>Mat.</hi> xii. 28. <hi>But if I with the Finger of God caſt out Devils, no doubt the Kingdom of God is come among you, but if I caſt out Devils by the Spirit of God, then the Kingdom of God is come unto you.</hi>

            <p n="4">4thly. <hi>Immenſity</hi> is alſo aſcrib'd to him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> cxxxix. 7.10. <hi>Whither ſhall I go from thy Spirit, or whither ſhall I flee from thy Preſence.

            <p n="3">3dly. <hi>Divine Operations</hi> are aſcrib'd to the Holy Spirit, ſuch as,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. <hi>Creation,</hi> Gen i. 2. <hi>The Spirit of God mov'd upon the Face of the Waters.</hi> By the Spirit of God, cannot be meant the Air or Wind, as ſome ſuppoſe: For that was not created till the ſecond Day, when God made the Firmament, the aforeſaid Place of Scripture is explain'd and illuſtrated, by <hi>Job.</hi> xxxiii. 4. <hi>The Spirit of God hath made me.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="3">3dly. The Unction of our Lord by the Holy Ghoſt is another Argument of his Divinity, compar'd <hi>Iſai.</hi> lxi 1. with <hi>Luk.</hi> iv. 18. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, becauſe he hath anointed me to preach good Tydings unto the Meek.</hi> The Unction of our Lord, alludes to a Uſage which obtain'd under the Jewiſh OEconomy, namely, of anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Kings, Prophets and Prieſts with Oyl, to ſignify their Authority and Fitneſs, to execute their ſeveral Offices, and therefore it plainly ſignifies that our Lord was authoriz'd, and qualified to perform the mediatorial Work, by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, which is no inconſiderable Argument of his Deity.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. The ſupernatural Works of Conviction, Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Sanctification, and Conſolation are likewiſe aſcrib'd to the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>John</hi> xvi. 8, 9. <hi>And when he is come he will reprove the World of Sin,</hi> John iii. 5. <hi>Except a Man be born of Water, and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</hi> On the Account of ſanctifying Influence, he is call'd <hi>the Holy Spirit,</hi> and in reſpect of his comforting Influence, <hi>the Comforter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5thly. The Holy Spirit did likewiſe Commiſſion Perſons for the Miniſtry, and in a ſovereign Way order as to the Places where they are to exerciſe it. Which is an unalia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Prerogative of the Crown of Heaven, and therefore an

inconteſtible Evidence of his Deity. See <hi>Act.</hi> xiii. 2. <hi>The Holy Ghoſt ſaid, ſeparate me</hi> Barnabas <hi>and</hi> Saul, <hi>for the Work whereunto I have called them,</hi> Acts xvi. 6, 7. They were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden of the Holy Ghoſt, to preach the Word in <hi>Aſia, they eſſayed to go into</hi> Bithinia, <hi>but the Spirit ſuffered them not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4thly The Holy Ghoſt is the <hi>Object</hi> of <hi>religious Worſhip,</hi> and hence Believers are ſaid <hi>to be his Temples,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> iii. 16, 17.

And hence <hi>equal Honour with the Father</hi> is aſcrib'd to him, (<hi>John</hi> v. 23.) From whence we may eaſily infer, that the Son is leſs than the Father, and yet equal to him in different Reſpects: He is equal to God the Father in regard of his Eſſence, and leſs than him, not only in reſpect of his human Nature, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in regard of his mediatorial Office. By becoming the Sinners Surety, he deriv'd their Guilt upon him, and ſo became Subject to the Father as a Debtor: He is likewiſe repreſented in Scripture as a Servant of God, on Account of his Mediation; becauſe he undertook it according to his Fathers Order, and is to be conſider'd in

the whole of this as acting in Purſuance thereof, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviency thereto: To which ſome add, <q>That he may be ſaid to be leſs than the Father, in reſpect of the Relation of Sonſhip, by which, in human Affairs, the Son is ſaid to be leſs than the Father, altho', as to the Being of Humanity, he be equal to him, yea, in Regard of Gifts, Wiſdom, Goodneſs, &amp;c. above him.</q>

it may be likewiſe obſerv'd, that in ſeveral Places of Scripture the Gifts, and Graces of the Holy-Ghoſt, and eſpecially the extraordinary Gifts are thus term'd.

That he knoweth the deep Things of God:</hi> But probably it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends this, that the Holy Spirit would communicate no other Doctrines, than what Chriſt had before reveal'd in the Goſpel; beſides the aforeſaid Phraſes ſeem to ſignify that the Order of the Holy-Spirits acting, is agreeable to the Order of his ſubſiſting, namely, that as he proceeds from the Father and the Son, ſo he acts from them, but without any Imperfection or Dependance in reſpect of his Eſſence, Exiſtence, or Action.</p>
            <p>But I may add, that it is objected againſt the Doctrine of the Trinity in general, namely, <q>That it is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Reaſon, and therefore ought not to be believ'd.</q>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That it is above Reaſon we confeſs, but that it is contrary to it we deny. Now a Doctrine may be truly ſaid, to be contrary to Reaſon, when it contradicts ſome of the firſt Principles of reaſoning, which are ſelf Evident, and univerſally acknowledged, ſuch as that a Thing can be, and not be at the ſame Time, that the whole is greater than a Part, &amp;c. A Doctrine cannot be truly call'd Unreaſonable,
<pb n="461" facs="unknown:005500_0464_103966CECCF1A8E0"/>
meerly becauſe it oppoſes unjuſt Deductions from firſt Principles; but we know not that the Article of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity contradicts any of thoſe firſt Principles before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, or others Parallel to them.</p>
            <p>It is alledg'd that this is an Inſtance of Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which ſome ſuggeſt, namely, <q>
                  <hi>That while we aſſert that</hi> there is but one God; <hi>in the mean Time we ſay, that</hi> there are three Perſons in the Godhead, and that each of theſe is God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But herein there is no Contradiction, becauſe we ſay not that the ſacred Three are diſtinct Gods; the Diſtinction reſpects their Perſonality, and not their God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head: And when we ſay there are three Almighties we mean not that theſe Perfections are diſtinct, but the very ſame in them all. Neither is the Conſequence valid from human to divine Perſonality, <hi>i. e.</hi> becauſe human Perſons are diſtinct Beings, that therefore the Divine muſt be ſo. If indeed the divine Perſonality were finite, like that of the Creature, then it might be reaſonably requir'd that a finite Mind ſhould account for it; but ſince it is not ſo, it muſt therefore be incomprehenſible, and thus our not being able to Graſp it ſhould be no Bar to our Belief of it. Surely ſeeing Almighty God knows beſt the Manner of his own Exiſtence, it is but reaſonable we ſhould believe the Account which he has given of it, in that Revelation which bears the Characters of a divine Original.</p>

juſtly infers, that <hi>he that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father. See</hi> v. 23. The ſame Truth is elſewhere aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> ii. 23.) Hence <hi>Paul</hi> concludes the <hi>Gentiles</hi> who were without CHRIST to be <hi>Atheiſts. (Epheſ.</hi> ii. 12.) And is not he an <hi>Atheiſt</hi> who denys religious Worſhip to him who is the true God. (<hi>Rom.</hi> i. 21.) And on the other Hand is he not an Idolater who offers religious Worſhip to one whom he believes not to be God. What Hope can we have of the Remiſſion of Sins, without Satisfaction be made for Sin, equal to its Demerit, which muſt be Infinite; becauſe Sin is objectively ſo, being committed againſt a Being of infinite Perfection? Now is it not utterly impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for a meer Creature, who is neceſſarily finite, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this infinite Taſk. To ſuppoſe Sin may be pardon'd without equal Satisfaction, is to confront the rectoral Juſtice of God as well as his Truth, which ſtands engag'd to iſſue the Threats of the firſt Covenant upon the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors thereof, either upon themſelves perſonally, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Surety in their Room and Place: And without Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don what can enſue but utter and irreparable Ruin? And what Ground have we to expect the Regeneration of Men who are dead in Sins and Treſpaſſes, without the Intervention of the Almighty Energy of the Holy-Spirit? And can this be exerted by one who is not God? And pray what is Religion without well grounded Hopes of the Remiſſion of Sins, and Regeneration, but Preſumption, Formality, and Deſperation? From all which it evidently appears, that the denial of the Godhead of the Son and Holy-Spirit, as well as of the Father, ſaps the very Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Chriſtian Religion, and exceedingly endangers the Salvation of Mens Souls.</p>

Religious Worſhip is certainly due to all the ſacred Three, as appears from what has been already ſaid before, and unleſs we know this, how can we perform it, and how can we expect <hi>Fellowſhip with the Father, and with the Son</hi> JESUS CHRIST, <hi>and the Communion of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> (1 John i. 3. 1 Cor. xiii.) except we know that there be ſuch Perſons? What can be of more Moment to us, than to be ſtrengthned in our Perſuaſion of the divine Original of the Holy Scriptures? And to this End is not our Knowledge of <hi>the Three that bear Record in Heaven</hi> peculiarly ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able? <hi>Surely to know the only true God and</hi> JESUS CHRIST <hi>whom he hath ſent is Life eternal</hi> John xviii. 3. <hi>And if any Man have not the Spirit of CHRIST, he is none of his,</hi> Rom. viii. 9.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. We ſhould glorify the ſacred Trinity in Imitation of the ſeraphick Doxology, <hi>Iſa.</hi> vi. 3. <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of Hoſts, the Heavens and Earth are full of the Majeſty of his Glory.</hi> Becauſe therein ſhines forth the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Happineſs of the ſupream Being, apparent in the endear'd Fellowſhip, mutual Knowledge and Complacence of the ſacred Three, (<hi>Prov.</hi> viii. 30. <hi>Mat.</hi> iii. 17.) There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is likewiſe conſpicuous the infinite Perfection of Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah: For thus the Attributes of Three Perſons unite in one Eſſence common to all, and are we not hereby taught, how the Father, Son and Spirit do mutually glorify each other, (<hi>John</hi> xvii. 4, 5, 22.)</p>
            <p>But the Conſideration of the Part which each Perſon of the ſacred Trinity performs in compaſſing of our Salvation, ſhould eſpecially invite our grateful Hoſanna's, together with that of the divine Goodneſs in revealing this Myſtery to us, which has been hid from Ages. (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> vii. 10.)</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. Let us ſeek with all earneſtneſs, Communion with the ſacred Trinity, ſeeing that this is an attainable and
<pb n="464" facs="unknown:005500_0468_103966C766EFFCB0"/>
moſt important Priviledge, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 4.) in this is our chief Excellency, our greateſt Happineſs and Security. (1 <hi>John</hi> ii. 2.) And hence the Prieſt of old was requir'd to bleſs the People, after the Trinity was diſtinctly mentioned, (<hi>Num.</hi> vi. 23, 24, 25.) No Comfort on Earth is equal to that of Fellowſhip with the Father, Son, and Spirit. Now to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this Communion, we muſt forſake Sin, which alienates us from God, and by a living Faith accept the Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that being thereby united to him, we may thro' him ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Communion with the Father, and Holy Spirit. <hi>He will pray the Father for us, and he will give us another Comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that he may abide with us forever, even the Spirit of Truth.</hi> (John xiv. 16, 17.) And having obtain'd Communion let us perform.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. The Offices we owe to the ſacred Trinity, ſuch as <hi>Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> being baptiz'd in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, let us keep our Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Engagements. We ſhould expect every ſalutary Bleſſing from all the Perſons of the Trinity, ſeeing they all by Council and Office, equally conſpire to promote our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. (<hi>Num.</hi> vi. 24, 27.) Having obſerv'd the Order of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring every Benefit, which is from the Father by the Son &amp; Spirit. (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> ii. 18.) In the mean Time we ſhould ask the Benefit peculiar to each Perſon, according to the divine OEconomy, particularly of him, namely, <hi>Love</hi> from the <hi>Father, Grace</hi> from the <hi>Son,</hi> and <hi>Communion</hi> from the <hi>Spirit.</hi> And on the other Hand, let us faithfully render that oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Duty we owe to each Perſon, namely, to the <hi>Father Reverence,</hi> to the <hi>Son Faith</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and to the <hi>Holy Spirit, Obedience.</hi> And in all our Prayers and Praiſes, let us after the Example of the primitive Church make diſtinct mention of all the Perſons of the Trinity; that ſo their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Glory may be ſuitably manifeſted by us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="465" facs="unknown:005500_0469_103966C5C7415C60"/>Finally that bleſſed Unity and Love, which ſubſiſts among the ſacred Three, invite our Imitation, <hi>let us therefoe keep the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace,</hi> becauſe hereby we ſhall in our Meaſure, in ſome Sort reſemble the ſacred Trinity. <hi>John</hi> xvii. 21. <hi>That they all may be One, as thou Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther art in me and I in thee;</hi> in this our greateſt Glory con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, <hi>John</hi> xvii. <hi>And the Glory which thou gaveſt me, I have given them, that they may be one, even as we are.</hi> With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Endeavours after Union to, and loving Communion with ſuch whom, from their Principles and Practice, we have Reaſon to think are the Saints of God, how can we expect Communion with the ſacred Trinity, or to be one in them. In a Word, the Beauty, Strength, Increaſe and Comfort of religious Societies, depend upon their <hi>Union</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they evidence to the World that they <hi>are Diſciples of CHRIST indeed,</hi> let us be therefore Followers of God as dear Children, and walk in Love, as CHRIST alſo hath lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us, and given himſelf for us, an Offering and a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to God of a ſweet ſmelling Savour. Now to God the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, the ſacred and venerable Three One, who bear Witneſs from Heaven, to the divine Original of that Religion we profeſs, be all Glory aſcrib'd by Men and Angels, throughout all Eternity. <hi>Amen</hi> and <hi>Amen.</hi>
