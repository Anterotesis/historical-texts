            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>That I might properly and faithfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this part of Divine Service, aſſigned to me, by the late <hi>Honourable Houſe of REPRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SENTATIVES,</hi> I have read theſe Words of the inſpir'd Royal <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> very naturally leading us to the Buſineſs of the Day: nor will it be thought unfit immediately to apply

our ſelves thereto; ſince for this Purpoſe we are called together: Eſpecially having ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a Teacher and Guide, to aſſiſt our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation as this Royal Prophet, who furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the entire Deſign, and very much the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials of our Diſcouſe, in the particulars which compoſe and compleat the Character of the Perſons, whom he deſigned to take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Adminiſtration of the Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in general, eſpecially in <hi>Council.</hi> This Honourable and Great Aſſembly will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be pleaſed to allow me, with ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planations, to refreſh their Minds and Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries thus ſeaſonably, with the recital of thoſe things, with which this admirable good Ruler did his own; that, like him, you may more fully diſcharge your high Office and Truſt of electing and fixing the moſt eminent Perſons in the important Office of His MAJESTY's <hi>Council.</hi> In order whereto, you will make proper Obſervations on the People of the Land, that you may diſcern and promote the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in it.

all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> having in the courſe of Providence, experienc'd a great Variety of Proſperity and Adverſity. And if it be thus, certainly it was but a very becoming Acknowledgement and Return made to the great Ruler of the World, in whoſe Hands his own times were, and by whom his Changes were ordered, to go into the general Reſolve he here makes, which is the Imitation of the Divine Clemency and Chaſtiſement to him and his People, by fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling up his own Adminiſtration <hi>with Mercy and Judgment,</hi> as Occaſions therefor ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

But becauſe he needed COUNSELLOURS to adviſe, and other <hi>Officers</hi> to aſſiſt him, he reſolves on the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Character of the Perſons on whom he would fix his Eye, and lay Authority, as the effectual, ſucceſsful Inſtruments of ſo great &amp; good a Work: which general Circumſtance and Occaſion is increas'd by what is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed had lately occur'd, at a time when he was moving the <hi>Ark,</hi> the Reſidence of God, to his own City and Houſe; for <hi>Uzza,</hi> who beheld the Ark trembling and tottering, contrary to the expreſs Prohibition of God, touch'd it and dy'd; which gave Occaſion to this good

On which, I need not ſay to this Audience, how applicable, the great Variety and Succeſſion of merciful and afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Providences to this <hi>Province,</hi> have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred theſe Words to our ſelves at this Day. In general, on the <hi>Text,</hi> I would obſerve the Character here given of the <hi>Candidates</hi> for Government and Council: For tho' it be in a ſingle Term, is very comprehenſive, as the original Word, tranſlated <hi>faithful,</hi> imports. And indeed Fidelity and Truth, more ſtrictly taken, are very great Vertues; much more when conſidered as attended with all others. Theſe were the <hi>Objects</hi> of the King's Eyes, which, tho' the <hi>Tranſlators</hi> have taken the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to turn only <hi>forward,</hi> doubtleſs the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the thing leads to the <hi>paſt</hi> and <hi>preſent</hi> as well as future time. For, without Queſtion, he had long ſince tho't on the matter; his preſent thought was upon it; and for the ſame Reaſon ever ſhould be. And as he had frequent Opportunity to ſee his People, at their publick Solemnities, &amp; in his own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs and Circuit, he would ſingle out the beſt qualified, inveſting them with proper Power and Authority.</p>

Agreeably whereto, at this time, we may do theſe following things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. Unfold the <hi>Character</hi> here given, <hi>deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> of the proper Candidates for Election.</item>
               <item>II. Conſider the proper Buſineſs and Office of the Electors, deſcribed <hi>by having their Eyes on theſe Faithful of the Land.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>III. Preſent ſome <hi>Arguments</hi> and <hi>Motives,</hi> to induce hereto, that they may prefer the Faithful alone. And finally,</item>
               <item>IV. Make ſome more particular <hi>Application</hi> on the whole.</item>
            </list>
            <p>I. Let us open the <hi>general Character</hi> here given, of the Perſons proper to be elected.</p>
            <p>In general, <hi>They ſhould be faithful and true Men;</hi> for they ſtand oppos'd to the Vicious, and Ill-qualified, whom he Names with deſign to reject and exclude them. 'Tis obſerved, the Perſons, whom he reſolves not to employ, are not the moſt ſcandalous and groſs Sinners; for the putting ſuch into Authority was too bare-fac'd to be done in any Government, where Vertue and Order have any tolerable Influence: but Perſons of a far leſs undeſirea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Character; who yet, by their real Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſecret Deſigns and Practices, were
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003417_0009_0FF839AC0617D850"/>
unfit for a publick Truſt. Now the <hi>Faithful</hi> muſt deſign a Character the reverſe of both theſe: and that the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſo meant, is very evident on the bear reading of the Pſalm. They muſt be Perſons of real good Abilities, of apparent and viſible Vertue; not groſsly Vicious, ſuch as Drunkards, Adulterers, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicators, Murtherers, Blaſphemers, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Swearers. For it would be an Inſult on God Almighty for ſuch to repreſent Him. They ſhould be Perſons of real and inward Vertue, as well as apparently fober, juſt and good. To which we muſt add, they were to be very much of King <hi>David'</hi>s Spirit, Ability and good Life; wearing his own Character. This appears from his Deſign in promoting them, which was, as he expreſſes it, <hi>to dwell with him:</hi> which very good Expoſitors inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret, <hi>to ſit in his Council,</hi> adviſing, and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Adminiſtration; ſo that the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars he mentions of himſelf, as well as thoſe pertaining to ſuch whom he renounces, as unfit for Office, are juſtly to be conſidered in the Deſcription. I ſhall therefore, agreeably hereto, mention two Things which generally enter into it.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. They are deſcribed from the place of their Nativity, Education and Abode.</item>

Theſe are the Men who love the Country as their Native Soil, as well as for its being a good and pleaſant Land, which the Lord their God hath given their Fathers and themſelves: and who, therefore, will concern themſelves for the publick good, as Members of the ſame Body, and in Truſt for Poſterity in all ſucceeding Generations. Thus the ancient Law by which King <hi>David</hi> govern'd, forbid Strangers ruling over his People, which is but the agreed Senſe of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. And therefore a Government by Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, was threatned as a Judgment to the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites,</hi> and oft times hath proved fatal to many flouriſhing Countries: For which Reaſon, <hi>the Faithful in the Land,</hi> were the Perſons whom this excellent Ruler accounted proper for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion.</p>

But 2. We are to conſider ſome ſpecial <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Vertues</hi> and <hi>political Excellencies,</hi> which render Perſons faithful, and are peculiarly eyed by this Royal Prophet.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Faithful are Perſons of eminent Skill and Wiſdom: which good Qualities firſt enter into the Character of a Counſellor. Such therefore ſhould be remarkably diſtinguiſhed in the Powers and Faculties of their Mind; the Compaſs and Extent of their Knowledge; the clearneſs and method of it; the turn and quickneſs of their Thought; it's Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Penetration and Sagacity: For readineſs and juſtneſs of Thought are great Perfections of the humane Mind, very needful for Rulers, particularly on Emergencies, and where the publick Affairs reſemble a <hi>Labyrinth.</hi> They ſhould be Men underſtanding the Times, knowing what their People ought to do. Like <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> they ſhould be Men of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior and Incomparable Wiſdom, to diſcern Things which are obſcure, unriddle what is doubtful, deſcry what is diſtant, clearly ſeeing through the Artifices, Colours and Pretexts, which, as a Cloak, wrap up ſecret Deſigns, &amp; cover deſigned publick Miſchiefs. They ſhou'd be very well acquainted with the frame of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature; with it's Capacities, Weakneſſes, Appetites, Paſſions, Humours, Diſadvantages, Conveniences and Dependances. In ſhort, with it's Vertues, Vices, Wants and Supplies.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:003417_0012_0FF8108D28019B90"/>
They ſhould know the Law of Nature and Nations; the preſent Policy and Power, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and Courſe of the World; eſpecially of thoſe on whom they border and depend, and with whom they Trade. They ſhould have an exact Knowledge of the civil and religious Conſtitution of their own Country, it's Riſe and Planting, Changes, Intereſts, and the like; peculiarly of the preſent Scituation, Aſpect and tendency of Affairs; and of the Perſons whom they ſerve and adviſe, and with whom they are aſſociated. To this purpoſe we may remember the Words of King <hi>Solomon</hi> the Preacher, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 5. <hi>Counſel in the Heart of Man is like deep Water, but a Man of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding will draw it out.</hi> Theſe things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſhould very plainly be opened, fully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, exactly compared and adjuſted, and, to this end, be cloſely and often conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd; by which means, good Deſigns may be laid, wiſe Schemes formed, ſuitable Laws enacted, and anſwerable Endeavours and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct apply'd, for the happy Iſſue of Affairs: <hi>For Wiſdom is profitable to direct.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. They are Perſons of inflexible Juſtice &amp; Impartiality. Otherwiſe their Skill will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate into Craft and Cunning, which, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being Serviceable, will be of pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conſequence. For there is ſomething due to every Man in the Community, which ſhou'd be rendred to him in particular. Therefore
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:003417_0013_0FF839B3D101E990"/>
the buſineſs of the Ruler is to conſider and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt the proportion, ſeaſon and manner, and then make a Diſtribution. This is the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Government to Perſons and Caſes; for which ſome have ſpecial Powers and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, which they ſhould improve, by framing ſuitable Laws and Orders for proportioning Rewards and Penalties; the adviſing whereto is one eſpecial Office of the Counſellour. Thus Honour, Fear, Cuſtom and Tribute will be rendred to all, who reſpectively may claim them; but without this there can be no Truth or Fidelity, in the Adminiſtration; for which Reaſon, a moſt ſtrict regard ever ſhould be had to it, and ſuch Council given as hath an evident and ſtrong Tendency to diſtribute it; for we read, <hi>He that ruleth over Men muſt be juſt:</hi> not being byaſs'd by any thing but ſtrict Equity and Juſtice: and therefore in all the Advice they give, and Aſſiſtance they afford, they ſhould aim wholly at what is ſtrictly juſt: This we are taught by <hi>David</hi> in this <hi>Pſalm, v.</hi> 3 <hi>I hate the Work of them who turn aſide, it ſhall not cleave to me.</hi> And before this, <hi>I will ſet no wicked thing before mine Eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. They are Perſons of inviolable Truth &amp; Veracity. Not allowing a Thought, much leſs a Word, leſt of all any Action oppoſite to the Truth. They will not injure the Name and Reputation of any, tho' it could be done ever ſo ſecretly and cloſely. Thus the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:003417_0014_0FF839B686FFF248"/>
ſpeaks, <hi>Context v</hi> 5, 7. <hi>Whoſo privily ſlandereth his Neighbour, him will I cut off: He that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Deceit ſhall not dwell within my Houſe; be that telleth Lies ſhall not tarry in my ſight.</hi> They will not reproach any, nor ſupplant them, with deſign to make room for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or others, much leſs allow themſelves in any Falſhood: for what Truſt can be put in ſuch, or what Credit given to their Report or Advice? They will therefore repreſent Perſons and Things, as they truly are, without any Artifice or Diſguiſe. They are ſuch as have great regard to the publick Faith and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, tho' made to private and meaner Perſons: not adviſing or conſenting to the Violation thereof, without a juſt Compenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the Damages that may ariſe to the whole Body, or any of it's Members. They will not diſſemble and diſguiſe their Principles, Views and Compliances; but declare and act openly. They are not aſhamed, nor afraid, the publick ſhould know, what themſelves are, deſign, maintain, and will proſecute: for they will abide by their diſintereſted Views. They are of ſuch Truth and Fidelity, that they will not defraud the Government to whom they are engag'd, of their Time, Skill and Strength. Their Faith differs from the publick only in degree and extent; not in kind and quality. They do not fear the ſtricteſt Enquiry into their Councils and Meaſures, nor the moſt publick Inſpection and Examination. For as
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:003417_0015_0FF839B991019B70"/>
the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> elſewhere ſays, <hi>They ſpeak the Truth from their Heart, Pſal.</hi> 15. 2. Their whole Action and Management is an exact Tranſcript of their Mind and Heart. They are not of a double Heart and Tongue. Nor do they conform their Temper, Diſcourſe, Principles and Converſation, to the change of Times and Company into which they fall; but preſerve an Harmony in their intire Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and Management, without acting the part of publick Hypocrites, who trim and ſhift Sides and Parties, as they apprehend their Intereſt may be promoted by it. But this leads me to ſay,</p>
            <p n="4">4. They are of a publick Spirit, which is but Juſtice and Fidelity to the Government, and their own Office. They make not their private Intereſt their <hi>End,</hi> nor Self the <hi>Center,</hi> to which all things in the Circle and Compaſs of their Ability, Authority, Influence and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, tend. They readily unclothe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of all private narrow Views, and put on a moſt enlarged Spirit; not regarding their own Profit in preference, much leſs in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the common Intereſt, which engroſſeth their <hi>own.</hi> They diſdain ſo mean a Thought as this, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> I have, by various Artifices, Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries and Compliances, wrought my ſelf into the Favour of thoſe who have promoted me to a publick Station, now therefore I will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove all my Skill, Strength and Opportunity
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003417_0016_0FF839BB1B7C29D0"/>
to encreaſe Honours on my ſelf and Family, and to carve out an handſome and growing Eſtate. They are ſuch whoſe perſonal Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit will not be the Spring and Motive of their Projections and Proſecutions, much leſs will they cloak their ſelfiſh Deſigns with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and ſhew of publick Zeal, that they may not be expoſs'd to the Obſervation and Cenſure of the World. They are ſuch who will make their own Fortune a Noble Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God and the common Wealth. And who, diſcerning a contracted Spirit in others, are ſo far from kindling the Sparks of it in their own Boſom, that they quench it. They are ſuch who divinely deſire the proſperity of the Body Politick, never converting it's Strength to the Head, or any particular Members, however Honourable or leſs Comely, ſo as to deprive the others of their juſt meaſure of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, Nouriſhment or Protection; but ſay with the <hi>Pſalmiſt, v.</hi> 3. <hi>I will ſet no wicked thing before mine Eyes, I hate the Work of them that turn aſide, it ſhall not cleave to me.</hi> This will render them Benefactors, while they ſeek not their own Wealth, but that of others.</p>
            <p n="5">5. They are Perſons of indefatigable Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and Induſtry. Who account their Office a Calling, in which, therefore, they muſt employ not divert themſelves. Their Station muſt be preſerved and maintain'd, the proper Buſineſs of it being continually done,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:003417_0017_0FF839BCA7F80288"/>
they muſt be reſolute to do their part of it, whatever Difficulties may ariſe, or attend them: not ſhrinking from any Service to which their Office leads, whatever Perplexities are forſeen, however long the Seſſions, or vaſt the multiplicity, and increaſe of Affairs. They muſt proportion their Induſtry to its proper Occaſions, and be early and conſtant, ready and chearful, whenever they are called, or Summon'd, to go and give the beſt Advice they can. Like King <hi>David, ſerving their Generation by the Will of God,</hi> till they fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep, or are decayed by Age and Infirmities, or otherwiſe are providentially diſcharged. Nor will they eat the Bread of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without Labour for it, it may be, more than proportionable; but imitate the great God, by unceaſing Care and Diligence; ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to be in Labours abundant, more than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others; continually turning their Eyes, and Thoughts on the publick Concerns; ever imploying their Heart and Hands in them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. They have riſing Courage and fixed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. Such preſence of Mind, &amp; ſtrength of Spirit, as not to be moved by any thing. So fixed in their Poſt, that neither can Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſoften, nor Frowns and Menaces affright them: reſolute to ſacrifice their Life, Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Eſtate, as well as Office and Influence, to the publick Weal. They, with Zeal, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd and ſoftned with Modeſty, and a becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:003417_0018_0FF839BFB9A8A690"/>
Defference to others, maintain and adhere to that, which, to them, appears juſt and fit; tho' differing from any, or all others: and therefore dare ſpeak their own Senſe, and act their own Judgment, tho' the ſubtil and mighty ſhould be on the other ſide of the Board. They are not unſtable as <hi>Reuben,</hi> not oppreſs'd with the Proſpect of gathering and impending Storms, nor are their Joynts looſed with the terror of the Mighty, but nobly ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain themſelves and their Station. They will knit their Brow againſt the Deſigns of the Wicked; diſcountenance Vice, Diſorder and Injuſtice, whenever they behold them; and ſcatter away Iniquity with their Eyes. They will, with the excellent King in our Context, <hi>drive away all the Wicked from their preſence,</hi> and Company; <hi>cut off all wicked doers from the City of the Lord, and early deſtroy all the Wicked of the Land:</hi> many of whom, with their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Vices, <hi>David</hi> expreſsly mentions, in this Pſalm, with Abhorrence, and a fixed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution and Courage, to break and deſtroy them. In fine, like <hi>Pillars</hi> in the State-houſe, they'll endeavour to be immoveable.</p>
            <p n="7">7. They are Perſons of very great Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Patience, Meekneſs and Condeſcention; who have Rule over their own Spirit, ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to the Diſcipline of Vertue. They cool and moderate their Paſſions and Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and raiſe themſelves above the Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:003417_0019_0FF839C1C384AE38"/>
Scorn and Contempt, yea, above the Malice and Spite of any. They give no place to Wrath; not deſire, nor ſeek to cruſh thoſe who oppoſe their Views or Intereſts. They are not of an ambitious and haughty Spirit, for ſuch an one this Prince would not ſuffer; <hi>nor him that hath a froward Heart.</hi> They ſtrive to temper their Powers and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, with goodneſs, gentleneſs and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which will render their Perſons very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible, and very much the Delight of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; for by this means, they more eaſily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Affections of the People, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der every Perſon about them eaſy, and all Buſineſs pleaſant and delightful. They are content others ſhould offer and enjoy their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, as well as themſelves: and ſo do not take upon them to dictate to all about them; nor are they uneaſy, if they are not permitted to do ſo. They endeavour that others may enjoy the Benefit of their Abilities, and rejoyce if any others are ſo happy, as to ſuggeſt any thing more pertinent and agreeable then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have done.</p>
            <p n="8">8. They are Men of ſtrict, and exemplary, perſonal Vertue and Devotion: in whom all moral Vertues are very Conſpicuous; abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Vice, but admiring Vertue. Their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration is known to all Men. They are cautious of what is doubtful, or of ill Report. Their Appetites are bridled. They are Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:003417_0020_0FF839C34DCF4B28"/>
on whom the divine Image is evidently impreſs'd, and viſibly repreſented, in their Spirit, Deſign and Life. They continually <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ar &amp; reverence the great God in their Heart, and ever are awed with the Senſe of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. They apply to him, the Fountain of Knowledge and Wiſdom, and of every Grace and Vertue; being aſſured, <hi>he will give them liberally, and not upbraid them,</hi> either with their Unworthineſs, or great Importunity. They are as ſenſible of their entire Dependance on the Almighty, as they would have others on them, and infinitely more. They are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that his Power, and Providence, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule every thing pertaining to themſelves and their People. And then beſides, they will not go into the evil Principles and Cuſtoms of this preſent World, or the Vices proper to the Age or Place where they live. They will not conſume their Skill, Time and Subſtance, in Sport and Games; much leſs in unlawful or ſuſpicious ones. They will not compell the World to believe they are, or deſign to be unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in another Man's Affairs, by being ſo in their own; for as it juſtly has been obſerved, He that will throw away his private Eſtate, will not ſcruple Bartering away the publick. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, they will be Patterns of all goodneſs: much concerned that themſelves be Vertuous, that all about them may become ſo. They are alſo careful in the Education, Government, Order, and Diſpoſal of their Families. And
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:003417_0021_0FF839C50BC31FA8"/>
herein they ſtrive to imitate the noble Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Royal <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> in our <hi>Context,</hi> who being deſirous of God's gracious preſence with him and his, would admit none into his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily that were Vicious, or if unawares they had crept in, he would immediately diſmiſs them; as he declares in 2d. &amp; 7th. verſes, <hi>I will behave my ſelf wiſely in a perfect way. O! when wilt thou come unto me. I will walk with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my Houſe with a perfect Heart. He that worketh Deceit, ſhall not dwell within my Houſe: he that telleth Lies, ſhall not tarry in my ſight.</hi> For he conſidered well the great danger of <hi>one</hi> infectious Member in his Family, and would not countenance and employ ſuch, leſt they ſhould prove unhappy Inſtruments to promote and proſecute ill Deſigns. For by being the Servants of Sin, he knew they neceſſarily were Rebels to God. Again, they will maintain divine Worſhip in their Houſes, and diligently attend the Devotions of God's Houſe. And beſides, they have very much at Heart the <hi>Morals</hi> of their People, ſeeking their ſecular Proſperity by their real Vertue. To this end, they endeavour the Government of Almighty God may be ſupported, his Worſhip main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, his reverend Name hallowed, his Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths ſanctified, his Word and Council regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and his Inſtitutions duly obſerved. Once more, they commend Religion and Devotion by their own good Example; themſelves <hi>walking in all the Commandments and Ordinances
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:003417_0022_0FF839C875A4E130"/>
of the Lord blameleſs.</hi> Their own Dwellings are Oratories, and their Families Churches. And beſides, they will never countenance, much leſs aſſociate, with looſe and vain Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who, by being ſo, affront the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, violate its Laws, break its Hedges, and diſturb the publick Peace. In ſhort, like <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, they are Men after God's own Heart, ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with a perfect Heart, and a willing Mind:</hi> Endeavouring that his Kingdom may come, and Will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven. And particularly in their own Land, purging it of the Wicked, that the City of the Lord may flouriſh, as in the 8th. verſe of our <hi>Context,</hi> wherein <hi>David</hi> ſhews that his greateſt Concern was to promote pure and undefiled Religion. And elſewhere he ſays, <hi>Depart from me, ye evil doers, for I will keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of my GOD.</hi> But at the ſame time they will ſpeak comfortably to the Lord's Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, endeavouring their Labours be duely Rewarded, and their Office and Perſon held in high Reputation, being defended, and protected from the Inſults of bold, deſigning and prophane Perſons.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Which is the laſt Thing here to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, They ſhould be ſuch as have approv'd themſelves able and faithful heretofore, either in that Office, into which they may now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain be elected, or in ſome other Station, in which divine Providence hath placed them.
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:003417_0023_0FF839CB18C26CB8"/>
Such a proof, wiſe Men are apt to ſeek. And this naturally and powerfully draws the Eyes of the Elector, and procures his Voice; which we may learn from the true Reading of the Text. But this leads me as naturally to the next general Head, which is,</p>
            <p>II. To conſider the proper Buſineſs and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the <hi>Electors,</hi> as it is deſcribed in the <hi>Text,</hi> by <hi>having their Eyes on theſe faithful of the Land, that they may dwell with them.</hi> The varying from the <hi>Text</hi> in the Number of the <hi>Electors,</hi> is a Circumſtance, not of material, but minute Conſideration. Their Eyes are here named, as the Inſtruments uſed by the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Powers: and their being turned on the Faithful of the Land, ſuggeſts theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Electors make themſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the People; more eſpecially with ſuch, who, it is probable, may be promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to publick Truſt; and among theſe, the beſt qualified, that they may certainly know their true and juſt Character. For which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, they ſhould obtain, as they are able, a perſonal Knowledge of them, not depending wholly or chiefly on Report and Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which of neceſſity would leave the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector very doubtful and uncertain. <hi>If a Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler hearken to Lies, all his Servants are wicked:</hi> and if he hearken, many Miſ-repreſentations
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:003417_0024_0FF839CCA355E600"/>
will be made to him. King <hi>David</hi> was aware of this, therefore reſolves in <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>He that worketh Deceit ſhall not dwell within my Houſe, he that telleth Lies ſhall not tarry in my ſight.</hi> And again, <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>Whoſo privily ſlandereth his Neighbour, him will I cut off.</hi> Doubtleſs, he had felt the Miſchief of partial Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of Perſons and Things, wherefore he would uſe his own Eyes, make all the perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Obſervation he could, that he might act with the cleareſt Knowledge, and greateſt Safety. He had known many of his People, eſpecially the principal Perſons, and had born their Names and Vertues in Mind and Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that he might advance them as there were Vacancies or Neceſſity. Electors are in great danger of having the Vertuous and Faithful ſlurr'd by the diſaffected, and the Mean and Vicious commended by falſe &amp; deſigning Men. Hence as Mr. <hi>Henry</hi> naturally obſerves, The Country muſt be ſearch'd for the beſt Men, and indeed, there is much Occaſion for it; for ſuch are modeſt, and do not urge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon the Government, but wait for the Obſervation, and Choice, and Call of their Rulers. The moſt forward are not uſually the moſt fit Perſons for publick Offices.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That they actually make Choice of ſuch, and thoſe alone; to which purpoſe, their Knowledge of them ſerveth, &amp; muſt be applied: without it they betray their Truſt. Hence

and their Opportunities with their Abilities; their publick Honours and Rewards being commenſurate to both, that all the Land may ſee the Value and Preference given to the Faithful in it. From which I paſs to the third general Head, which is,</p>
            <p>III. To preſent ſome Arguments and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to perſwade hereto, that they may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Faithful alone. And in the firſt place,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let it be conſider'd how much the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Almighty God, the great Ruler of the World, is concerned herein. There is but one God the Father of all, and one Lord Jeſus Chriſt, eſpecially to us Chriſtians. <hi>The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is the Lords, and he is the Governour among the Nations.</hi> His Supremacy is undoubted; for by him Kings reign, and Princes decree Righteouſneſs. Wiſdom and Counſel are his; yea, ſound Knowledge and Underſtanding. Earthly Rulers are his Miniſters, and for good to his People. As his Servants, they are qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, commiſſioned, cloathed, aſſiſted, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, and rewarded by him. His Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they muſt regard ſincerely, and obey them ſtrictly and ſteadily. His Kingdom &amp; Glory ſhould be their chief Concern; for of him, and thro' him are all things; to him therefore all the Glory and Praiſe ever ſhould be aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. His Name is put upon them, which they may not defile. Now who but the Faithful
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:003417_0028_0FF839D4C7F07880"/>
can, or will give him the Glory which is his due? If Rulers fight againſt GOD, prophane and blaſpheme his ſacred Name, diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance Religion, and encourage Vice, they here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by reproach his Government, and diſhonour his Name, which they wear as their civil Stile: and many will be apt to think God himſelf is altogether ſuch as his Servants on Earth; ſo that in their ſecret Thought, they will be tempted to charge him with Male-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, inaſmuch as his Providence per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits ſuch to be gods over his People. What higher Motive than this, of the divine Glory, which ſhould be the chief deſign of Man, can I poſſibly preſent to you? or what Argument equal to it?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let it be conſidered, how much they ſhould be moved hereto, on the account of Government it ſelf: the due Adminiſtration whereof cannot be expected on any other grounds than thoſe we have laid. For what can be well done without theſe good Qualities in Rulers? eſpecially this Care of thoſe, whoſe Buſineſs it is to diſpoſe of publick Offices? Without this there will be no due Circulation of the Blood, nor Transfuſion of the Spirit, Life and Strength of the whole Body; but every thing will ſtagnate, languiſh and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy. If due Regard be had to this divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of King <hi>David,</hi> the Eyes in the Head will be cleared, the Hands ſtrengthen'd, every
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:003417_0029_0FF839D75418F948"/>
Member will flouriſh and thrive in its due proportion; do its Office, maintain its Station, and perfect the Conſtitution: the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of which very much depends on a proper Adminiſtration, and this on the Perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with it; and that theſe be ſuitable, depends on thoſe who elect and appoint them. For undue promotions in proceſs of Time, will bring great Weakneſs and Convulſions, and it may be, iſſue in a Diſſolution: to be ſure, the Benefits deſign'd from Government will not be enjoy'd by them; upon which the People will be apt to deſpiſe it, trample on Authority, and think it an Artifice to ſerve ſome dark Deſigns, and particular Perſons. Doubtleſs the Decays into which States and Kingdoms hath fallen, till at laſt total Ruine hath come upon them, are much to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, to Supineneſs, Cunning or Wickedneſs, the Selfiſhneſs or tyranous Ambition, of thoſe who have had the publick Offices in their Hands, and led into the Councils and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which have been taken. This brings on a corruption and degeneracy of Principles and Manners, which provoke GOD Almighty to leave them to their own Councils, and take the Fate they have choſen; giving them Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to Rule over them, or ranging Bears to devour them. A healthy Conſtitution, by good Conduct, and prudent Care, may be preſerved Athletick, and be ripen'd by the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity and Ability of the Officers under it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:003417_0030_0FF839D96AA655C0"/>
But the decay thereof muſt gradually enſue, as there is a Neglect of filling up all Stations with the beſt Officers; or if there be ſuch an intermixture of the feeble, falſe, and wicked, as to give too many bad Examples, neither doing any good themſelves, nor aſſiſting or conſenting others ſhould do it. Hence a civil Conſtitution, however perfect and adapted to a Country, is but uſeleſs, unleſs it be anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and exerciſed with the Life and Spirit of its Members, eſpecially of the Head, Heart and Hands: It is but a Notion, not the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Government, in which the Fruits and Effects muſt be anſwerable to the Deſign of it. Wherefore the viſible Danger, and Deſtruction of the Form of a People's Government, ariſing from their not preferring the Faithful, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king proper pains to obſerve and promote them, is a ſtrong and affecting, becauſe a very near Motive.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The reformation of a People's Manners ſhould be a quickning Conſideration hereto. Reformation ever was, and will be a neceſſary Work: for in the Land of Uprightneſs many will deal perverſely. Sin, and Immorality u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually are too flouriſhing, oftimes bold and rampant. Hence the Temper, Deſign and Adminiſtration of earthly Rulers ſhould an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer their Title, <hi>for they are gods:</hi> and in Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of God the great King, they ſhould be a Terror to Evil-doers, praiſing and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:003417_0031_0FF839DB839B6A88"/>
ſuch as do well. They ſhould acquaint their People with their publick and prevailing Diſorders, warning and charging againſt them. They ſhould do Execution on bold Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours, and as the Royal <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> reſolves, <hi>cut off and deſtroy them.</hi> They ſhould alſo diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute and impart their Powers and Vertues, among their People: eſpecially by Example, which will greatly influence to a happy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation: for Vertue or Vice will very much ebb or flow, as it is in the Fountain of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: Theſe in their People will very much be accounted to their Leaders. And therefore if all who are in Government be not faithful, how will an effectual Stand be made againſt Diſorder and Wickedneſs? For can it be thought a vicious Ruler can have Zeal, or ſo much as the Face, to puniſh Vice in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, or his own particular Vice coppied by others, and this publickly? Who can have ſuch little Conduct, while they know the Vice and Sentence upon it, will inſtantly be retor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and rebound on the guilty Judge? Poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly no Age of the Chriſtian World, ſince the Reformation, more needed the revival of that Work than the preſent, nor any Day, of any particular Age, more than this. Wherefore, the moſt faithful Perſons ſhould have the Power and Authority to effect it, put into their Hands; and ſuch alone, that one publick Officer may not wink at the Crimes which another puniſheth, nor openly violate the Laws
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:003417_0032_0FF839DD0F815470"/>
which all ſhould ſupport. For we know that <hi>one Sinner will deſtroy much good.</hi> Therefore the greateſt Gravity, Sobriety, Self-denial, Circumſpection and Zeal, become all thoſe who are Guardians of the Vertue of a People, deſigning to lead them back to the Life of God. But this leads in the laſt place,</p>
            <p n="4">4. To obſerve the revival and flouriſhing of Religion requireth this. For if the Wicked are exalted the Righteous mourn, and well may they do ſo; but if the Righteous are promoted there is rejoycing; for then may they <hi>live quiet and peaceable Lives in all Godlineſs and Honeſty.</hi> And then beſides, the Enacting good Laws, and their due Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are herein greatly concerned; therefore the promotion of faithful Men is of the firſt Conſideration, and greateſt Moment. For Religion is the Life of a People, the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of humane Nature, and therefore its <hi>trueſt Life.</hi> If this be diſcouraged, neglected, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned and ſtarved, gradually all will decay. Civil Government will looſe its chief Support and Security; for the ſtrength and vertue of <hi>Oaths,</hi> which uſually are the great dependance of States, have their intire foundation and force in Religion. Wherefore it is but their Self-Intereſt to promote Religion; ſince the profit is their own. Nothing contributes to the civilizing and thriving of a Country like it: nothing truly without it. Hence ſome
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:003417_0033_0FF839DF9C147DE8"/>
really irreligious Men fondly ſupport it among their People, knowing they will be more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ruled, and themſelves more ſecure in the Adminiſtration. The Miniſters of Religion do very much to better the <hi>Morals</hi> of a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> they teach &amp; enjoyn Vertue in a very taking manner, and declaim with equal force againſt all Vice. In the Name of GOD, their great Maſter, they command Obedience to lawful, civil Power, urging it with ſtronger and more perſwaſive Motives than Civil Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers themſelves can, that is to ſay, with ſuch as are taken from the next World. They alſo pray both for <hi>Rulers</hi> and their <hi>People:</hi> and which is of great Influence and Conſequence, give good Example of Life; going before their Flocks in all Vertue and Goodneſs, thereby teaching them in the beſt manner how to Obey thoſe who are over them. From all which Reaſons, it appears that Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment owes very much, in Juſtice and Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, to the Paſtors of our Churches, and the Religion which it is their buſineſs and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to promote. Hence their Perſons, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, Order and Adminiſtrations, cannot rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be too much encouraged, defended and ſupported. Not that I deſign to ſay, it is the Buſineſs of the Magiſtrate, <hi>as ſuch,</hi> to define the Faith, determine the Worſhip, and adminiſter the Offices and Diſcipline of the Church; any more than it is the Paſtors Right, <hi>as ſuch,</hi> to Enact civil Laws and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:003417_0034_0FF839E1CE9667D0"/>
them, for theſe Officers are in their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture very different. There is no publick Conſcience, nor infallible humane Guide in the Church, much leſs in the State: for Jeſus Chriſt alone is Lord of Conſcience, and by his infallible Spirit of Truth, leads his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples into all Truth, teaching them all things: Yet the civil Ruler ſhould be careful that his People be humane and moral, practice the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Nature, obſerve the Decalogue, and protect and incourage the Chriſtian in his Faith, Worſhip and Diſcipline; provided he maintain, no Principle, propagate no Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor go into any Practice, ſubverſive of the rights of Mankind, the publick Peace and Proſperity: but the ſuppreſſion of Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Licentiouſneſs, Intemperance, Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Pride, Prodigality, Covetouſneſs, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Curſing, Swearing, and the like, evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is his Province, and greatly tends to the flouriſhing of Religion. Now faithful Men alone will do theſe things; wherefore, for the ſake of the Religion of this People, which certainly is the very beſt Thing we have, ſuch Perſons alone ſhould be elected. To all which Arguments and Motives, I might add the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Law of Almighty God; the Character he gives of Rulers; the Choice he has made of them; with the Advice and Charge he has given to thoſe who may elect them; the Principles and Examples of good Rulers, ſuch as <hi>Joſeph, Moſes, Jethro, Samuel</hi> and <hi>David,</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:003417_0035_0FF839E364A49D80"/>
particularly in this <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and elſewhere: Alſo what wiſe States have Inſtituted, preſcribed and Practiſed; the deſire and expectation of all Mankind; the great deſign of all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; with the good Fruits and great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages ever deriving from the good manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it. Nor did any People ever yet flouriſh, however happy their Conſtitution was, but by this Care and Fidelity. For which we need look no where elſe than into the Hiſtory of the <hi>Britiſh Empire,</hi> where ſome of the greateſt Proofs of it are moſt legible; not to ſpeak of our ſelves. But a particular Conſideration thereof, muſt, for Brevity's ſake, be omitted. And thus I have inſenſibly alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy entred upon the laſt Thing propounded, which was in the fourth place,</p>
            <p>IV. To <hi>apply</hi> theſe things more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to this Honourable, <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>General Court</hi> and <hi>Aſſembly</hi> now preſent. But much of what uſually has been ſaid on ſuch Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in the cloſe of the Sermon, has been thought fit, ſhould be the firſt Buſineſs of it. Only with your leave and patience, which I very much need, I would Congratulate my Native Country with its great Happineſs this Day, that I come, as it were, with your own Words, and am your Mouth to all the People of the Land, declaring on your behalf, as Holy <hi>David</hi> in our Text. Yourſelves of this Land are intruſted with this Power, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:003417_0036_0FF839E56F803F70"/>
with the Faithful of it; for whom alone, we truſt, you will give your Voice. It ſhould be remembred that, once and again, we have ſeen the <hi>chief Chair</hi> of Government, with other Poſts, reſerved to be filled by the <hi>King's moſt Excellent MAJESTY,</hi> by his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Favour, filled with Perſons of principal Note and Figure, taken from among ourſelves: I muſt remember it at this time in gratitude to His Majeſty's paternal Goodneſs and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention, eſpecially in obſervance to the Government, who have publickly and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully acknowledged it. For which, the leaſt we can do, is, to <hi>approve</hi> ourſelves <hi>religious</hi> to God, <hi>loyal</hi> and <hi>dutiful</hi> to the King, and by both, <hi>wiſe</hi> for ourſelves: praying down, with moſt fervent Devotion, the beſt of Bleſſings on the <hi>King's MAJESTY,</hi> our moſt <hi>gracious QUEEN,</hi> and their <hi>illuſtrious Iſſue</hi> and <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,</hi> as we have done this Day, and ever ſhall do. And as this People ſhould be thus ſenſible and loyal in their intire Body, ſo more eſpecially will it increaſe the Occaſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, for yourſelves, our Honourable Rulers, to give us to ſee the happy Event of this Day in your making Application, of what has been offer'd for your Aſſiſtance, to your ſelves. Your EXCELLENCY, hath the Happineſs which this <hi>Text</hi> repreſents, not only to be honoured with the chief Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion over your Native Land, and the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Power of approving your Council; but
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:003417_0037_0FF839E853A28128"/>
in order to the management of that Truſt, by Virtue of the publick Circumſtances into which your Birth, Education, Acquaintance, and publick Offices have brought you, are very well acquainted with your People, and which among them you moſt ſafely may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and appoint, for the Royal Honour and Intereſt, which, in Obedience and Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, muſt ever very nearly affect you, and for the welfare of this whole People, now yours. Your HONOUR's alſo, of each Houſe in the Legiſlature, at leaſt many of you, by the ſame means but now mentioned, and by reaſon of your Dwelling in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of the Land, have a very happy Advantage to know, obſerve, nominate and elect ſuch this Day, as are faithful. You are, or may be acquainted with their Perſons, Principles, Capacities and Inclinations, with their diſintereſted View of the publick Good. And we aſſure ourſelves, nothing will influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence you, to wink at any thing unbecoming, to open your Eyes on the diſ-qualified, much leſs to fix them on ſuch, or ſhut them againſt the eminent and approved. Many things, in particular, your own ſuperior Powers and Skill, can ſuggeſt, which may move to a moſt exact and careful Diſcharge of your impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Truſt. But becauſe your Deſire hath commanded ſome more cloſe Application of my Thoughts of late to this Subject, I ſhall now take the liberty, humbly, and with great
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:003417_0038_0FF839E9F8587BF8"/>
Defference, to remind you of ſome near Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations which may unite with the Current of your publick Thoughts this Day. The <hi>Royal Charter</hi> and <hi>Truſt,</hi> with the good <hi>Laws</hi> of the Land, ſtill ſubſiſting, very much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, and urge your following the good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution which this <hi>Text</hi> exhibits. So doth the Royal <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> Example and Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; to which we cannot but add the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Deſire, &amp; great Expectation of this good and loyal People. For what Province, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Crown, more values the Royal Family and Succeſſion, or more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly and heartily prays for the King? to which our wiſe and good Governours have not failed to bear their honourable and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Teſtimony. This good People, I ſay, have their Eyes upon their Rulers, eſpecially on Thoſe, whom they have choſen to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them, on this great Occaſion, to act their Power, that they faithfully perform this weighty Truſt. And here, particularly, it ſhould be conſidered of how great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance a Seat in <hi>His Majeſty's Council,</hi> in this Province, is: For the Council being a Branch, an eminent Branch of the <hi>Legiſlature;</hi> parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, as it were, of the King and People, in whom both meet and unite, moderating mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters between them, renders them very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable and important. They have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable intereſt in framing Laws, paſſing Acts and Orders, and their Concern is great
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:003417_0039_0FF839ECC25FE130"/>
in filling up civil Offices of every kind; particularly, Judges and Juſtices, the Offices for Probate of Wills, and ſettlement of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtate Eſtates, being of their Approbation; and together with the Governour, finally ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to their Deciſion; the Overſight of our Colleges partly under their Care; the advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on Emergencies of Government, ſpecially during this Court's Receſs, when oft times but a few of this Order can be preſent; the Hand they have alſo in diſpoſing of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Treaſure, &amp; <hi>c.</hi> Theſe things, ſingly, how much more together, may be ſuppoſed to give a vaſt Weight to this Order. And when to all theſe, we add the Conſideration, that the <hi>Royal Charter</hi> has very much left it with the People of the Land, to chooſe out the moſt accompliſhed and faithful, (which certainly argues very great Wiſdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the King) theſe things, which, I doubt, I have very imperfectly expreſs'd, will give new Force and Conduct, for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of your Truſt, that you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ay have and exerciſe a becoming Care in it. And we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but expect the better Iſſue, ſince not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Number of <hi>Electors</hi> do daily increaſe, but we have alſo a continual growth of <hi>Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi> of Diſtinction, Education and Subſtance; which yield an increaſe of Candidates for the Council Board, as well as for all other Offices. Nor can we forget here the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the Times and publick Affairs; the
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:003417_0040_0FF839EE4CB63DF0"/>
mention whereof is ſufficient for me. Unto all which I would add, We may well remind ourſelves of the original Purchaſers, Planters and Magiſtrates of this Country, who made this Rule of King <hi>David'</hi>s their own; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in giving the beſt Example to all their Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. For by this means they laid the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of that Growth and Perfection unto which, at preſent, we are arrived. And if ſo, we can't think any other, but that our full Maturity muſt ariſe from the ſame eſſential Principles, which hitherto have preſerv'd and ripen'd us.</p>
            <p>If I do not miſtake, we are <hi>now,</hi> in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of this <hi>Day,</hi> entring on the <hi>ſecond Century</hi> of chuſing our Magiſtrates, within this Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the ancient <hi>Maſſachuſetts.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, on this Occaſion, to call to mind our Fathers <hi>publick Spirit,</hi> and the good Succeſs of it, is a proper Reverence for their Perſons, Principles and Proceedings: and the juſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement we are to make of it, is our ſtrict Imitation of them. This is due to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, Purchaſe, Piety and Prayers, and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone fit Diſcharge of that Truſt thereby com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to each ſucceeding Generation. What we have, we ſhould account the purchaſe of their Money, yea, of their very Lives; Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd with their Tears; Sanctified by their extraordinary Vertue, Example and Prayers to God; tranſmitted by their ſolemn Charge
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:003417_0041_0FF839F0DB4AE870"/>
to their Children; inrich'd &amp; ſealed with their Toil and Blood, which was ſhed by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſpitable and mercileſs <hi>Heathen:</hi> wherefore we ſhould be as careful and tender of our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelves and Succeſſors, as they were.</p>
            <p>But to be more particular,</p>
            <p>Your EXCELLENCY hath drawn the Eyes of this People upon you, in your many Declarations and Reſolutions, moſt publickly made, on behalf of Vertue and Religion. You very well know the great and growing dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy of this Land, and will therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit us to expect a happy Reformation in the ſuppreſſion of all Vice, and encouragement of Vertue and good Men.</p>
            <p>And as we thank God for the good Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, you long ſince gave, in your Perſon and Family, and in our Churches, of which, you are ſo happy, as to be a very Honourable Member, by Birth, Baptiſm and Choice; ſo we hope it will have a great and becoming Influence on all about you, and whom you employ: eſpecially while you are careful to continue and brighten your good Example, it may, more particularly, have an happy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on our Families, and on thoſe of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Figure, to provoke and prevail with them to Conſecrate themſelves to the Lord, and their Houſes to be <hi>Bethels:</hi> an emulation
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:003417_0042_0FF839F2668D9930"/>
of you, in which, we truſt, will very much pleaſe you, as we are ſure, it will greatly Honour you. And then beſides, as Your EXCELLENCY, is advanced to the chief Seat of Honour and Dignity among your Brethren, and have either <hi>alone,</hi> or in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with your <hi>Honourable Council,</hi> a Power, to diſpoſe of many Offices, of very great Conſequence to this People; ſuch as <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Military</hi> Poſts; we truſt you will never impower or employ any in theſe Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who evidently fight againſt God and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or are ſlack in their own Principles and Lives: but will ever remember and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Reſolution of King <hi>David,</hi> in the latter part of the Verſe, where our <hi>Text</hi> lies, and which exactly ſuits to my purpoſe, <hi>He that walketh in a perfect way, he ſhall ſerve me,</hi> that is to ſay, in ſome Station and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Honour, which the original Word deſigns.</p>
            <p>And now, as for the <hi>Honourable Perſons</hi> who may this Day be elected: The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, which has already been given, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficently ſhews, what our Expectation from them muſt be, namely, That they faithfully diſcharge all the Duties of their Office; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, conſidering of how vaſt Importance it is, of which we have heard before, and by how much more critical the Times, and Affairs of the <hi>Province</hi> are, or may be.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="unknown:003417_0043_0FF839F520F220B8"/>
In a word, There is very great need of Wiſdom, Zeal, Steadineſs and Courage, in the whole Government at this Day; conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the great Decays, into which Religion, I do not mean, that of a Party, (for true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion diſdains ſuch limits, the Name and Thing) but <hi>Vital</hi> and <hi>Catholick</hi> Religion; the deep Decays into which that is fallen and falling.</p>
            <p>And here ſuffer me, with a becoming Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, to put you in mind, That the <hi>Paſtors</hi> of our Churches need much Countenance; it may be more ſtill, and more effectual mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, for their Support, that ſuch Pariſhes, which, to ſay the beſt of them, have neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the Inſtruction and Reſolve iſſued by this Court, a few Years ſince, may find the <hi>Legiſlature</hi> was as ſincere and fixed <hi>fully</hi> to perform and effect that juſt and neceſſary Deſign and Work, if that more mild and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Method did not take the deſired Effect. Again, it is evident, that Numbers among us will carry off the <hi>Exciſe</hi> laid on a ſingle Gallon of Strong Liquor with one Draught: the Concluſion therefore is open, That if <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance</hi> muſt be reformed, (and all agree that it is neceſſary) it ſhould be clog'd with Penalties and Difficulties which equal or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the ſtrength of the vicious Appetite: and that the <hi>Exceſs</hi> ſhould ſtrictly be
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:003417_0044_0FF839F9495C2DE0"/>
obſerved, and puniſh'd by all proper Officers. Once more, Pride, with other riſing faſhiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Luſts, Swearing, Curſing, Sabbath-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Idleneſs, Laſciviouſneſs, Covetouſneſs and Prodigality, ſhould be treated with great Severity; but eſpecially I muſt obſerve, on behalf of God Almighty, that, while we ſet a very great Value on our own Name, and wou'd recover vaſt Damages for the Injuries done to it, we ought not, in <hi>common Decency,</hi> to ſet <hi>His</hi> at a lower rate, permitting the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt Breath to ſully it, almoſt unpuniſh'd. And now this would carry on the Addreſs to all the civil Officers of the Land, that they be faithful; otherwiſe our good Laws will fail of Execution, and certainly ſap the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of Vertue, Religion, and the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Nor will it be leſs fatal if any Perſons are promoted to Office, meerly for the ſake of their Family, Relations, Acquaintance, Education and Eſtate, or indeed for any other Reaſon, beſide their Fidelity.</p>
            <p>I might, in the next place, ſpeak to all the People in the Land, could I reach them; but this being practicable only by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable their <hi>Rulers,</hi> and eſpecially their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives,</hi> I would only ſay, It is hoped your Honours will ever Influence your Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipals to elect ſuch as have been deſcribed, into the ſeveral Offices proper to the Affairs of your Towns, Diſtricts and Courts: and

               </gap> own good Principles and Practices, eſpecially your Conduct and Faithfulneſs this Day, draw their Eyes upon you. For the neglect of making a due Choice in our ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Societies, gradually will bring on great Corruption, and in the end it may be, Confuſion and a Diſſolution.</p>
            <p>And now before I conclude, there is an Application of this Subject, ſo naturally ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from all I have ſaid, to the <hi>Youth</hi> of the Land, and of ſuch Importance, that I may by no means be allowed to omit it. For nothing can be more ſuitable, than, on this Occaſion, to put you in mind of your excellent Parents and Progenitors; that, like them, you may be faithful to God, to Religion, to your Country and Families: but mine Eyes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly are upon ſuch, whoſe temporal Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, Deſcent and Education, open a proſpect of their being called to publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. It would therefore be very happy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if the young People among us, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Gentry, would ſeriouſly conſider this matter, and endeavour every way to conform themſelves, to the Temper and Life here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed: not preſuming to expect any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance or Promotion without it; but with it you may ſtand fairly among the Candidates for Authority. Wherefore, be ambitious of ſerving God in your Generation, and being beſt qualified for it. This will render your
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:003417_0046_0FF839FD88B199E8"/>
Perſons honourable and lovely, your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement univerſally acceptable, and your Adminiſtration, juſt and eaſy. But more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſhould Thoſe regard this Advice, whoſe Predeceſſors or Anceſtors have been thus pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly honoured, that you may riſe up in your Fathers ſtead, and, if it may be, with ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Accompliſhments. So the Eyes of the People ſhall feed upon you. And as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Motive hereto, conſider Degeneracy and Corruption in the Youth procures and portends nothing but Diſgrace to their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and the Land. For if the Vicious and Un-qualified ſhould deſire, and have the Face to ask, or ſeek, and be permitted to ſuſtain publick Offices, it would ſecretly ſpread, and anon become common: from all which the utter Diſſolution of Manners muſt enſue. Therefore it is highly incumbent on their Parents, Guardians and Inſtructors, very watchfully to obſerve them, that they may diſcover their Principles, Spirit, Appetites, Deſigns, Diverſions and Company; forming them for future Service, unto which the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Vertue, Safety and Proſperity, of their Houſes, as well as the publick Weal, are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and powerful Inducements. Let the Royal <hi>Preacher'</hi>s Exhortation to the Youth, with all <hi>his</hi> and <hi>its</hi> attending Circumſtances, be Ingraven on the Hearts of your Children, and be very legible in their Univerſal Life.</p>

I come now to obſerve. That agreeably to the uſual Form of the Diſcourſes of the Day, I ſhould have applied my ſelf to the Reverend, the <hi>Miniſters of the bleſſed Goſpel of GOD</hi> our Saviour; intreating the Elder as Fathers, and the Younger as Brethren; but, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, I am happily prevented by the Sermon to the <hi>Clergy</hi> of late Years, following the Day after this Solemnity; performed by ſuch as are every way my <hi>Fathers.</hi> But that I might not aſſume too much to my ſelf, and abruptly omit all Notice of ſo excellent a Body, as the Paſtors in this Land are: I would humbly take the liberty to remind them of a few <hi>Texts,</hi> which turn on the important <hi>Term</hi> of our Text, and are of as great Note and Conſequence in <hi>their</hi> Character, as <hi>in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates.</hi> For by our high and holy Office we are <hi>Stewards of the Myſteries of God, and of Chriſt,</hi> the Myſteries of the Goſpel. Now of ſuch it is required, <hi>that a Man be found faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi> We truſt he hath counted us faithful, therefore hath he put us into the Miniſtry. <hi>Who then is a Faithful and Wiſe Servant, whom his Lord hath made Ruler over his Houſhold, to give them their Meat in due ſeaſon; Bleſſed is that Servant, whom his Lord when he cometh ſhall find ſo doing. Verily I ſay unto you, He ſhall make him Ruler over all his Goods.</hi> Hear we then the Voice of the great Shepherd, <hi>Be thou faithful unto Death, and I will give thee a

Crown of Life. He that hath an Ear to hear, let him Hear what the Spirit faith unto the Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To cloſe all, and reſume the great deſign of this Diſcourſe, we the Lord's <hi>Miniſters,</hi> the Paſtors of the Churches, under your <hi>civil</hi> Juriſdiction, are equally concerned, in our private and publick Capacity, with any of the Land in the common Proſperity. We there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore come together, on ſuch Occaſions as this, to bear our publick Teſtimony to the faithful and acceptable Words, that are ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, by any of our Order, whom you are pleaſed <hi>Annually</hi> to invite, to lay the ſacred Councils before you. We come with our beſt Wiſhes, and moſt hearty Prayers, thereby commending your Honourable Perſons, Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Adminiſtrations, to the great &amp; good God. We do therefore now moſt ſincerely wiſh you a Bleſſing out of this Houſe of the Lord; where you uſed to be Bleſs'd. We pray God may be with you, <hi>this</hi> and <hi>all</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Seſſions; and <hi>this</hi> Day peculiarly, giving you Wiſdom and Fidelity, Union, Unanimity and Succeſs:—That he will graciouſly preſerve your Perſons, Families, and the Cities of your People, while you are abſent from them; and render your Return and Journeying homeward, your Tabernacles, and more eſpecially the Churches of our God, proſperous:—That this may be the happy

beginning of a ſecond Century of Elections, and that the beſt of Bleſſings may now, and ever, deſcend, and reſt on the <hi>Britiſh Empire,</hi> and on the KING. And now with whoſe Words, and among all his, with which more ſuitable, can I ſhut up all, than thoſe of this admirable good King, who gave them in our <hi>Text:</hi> May you therefore with him, always <hi>have your Eyes on the faithful in the Land:</hi> And when you have ſerved your Generation according to the Will of God, and fall aſleep, have an open Entrance miniſtred unto you abundantly into the everlaſting Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, where you ſhall ſtand and Miniſter before him for ever. Which <hi>God grant of his Infinite Grace, through our bleſſed Redeemer, unto whom,</hi> that is, <hi>unto the Father and Son, with the Holy Ghoſt, be aſcribed all Honour and Glory, World without End.
