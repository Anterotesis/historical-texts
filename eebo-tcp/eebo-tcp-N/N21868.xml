            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>TO preſent, at one view, a ſeries of the moſt remarkable events, tranſactions, and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents which have occurred in ancient and modern times, and to tranſmit to poſterity the names and atchievements of great men, particularly of thoſe by whoſe exertions, under Divine Providence, the United States enjoy their preſent happy form of government, has been the principal deſign con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated in the preſent publication.</p>
            <p>Through the whole of the following pages, the editor has ſelected his articles from hiſtorians of the firſt rank, and from the moſt authentic An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naliſts; hence he hopes, that his performance will be found uſeful to every claſs of readers—To the ſtudent it may frequently ſave the trouble of turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over a number of volumes to refreſh his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; and to thoſe whoſe leiſure cannot admit of the peruſal of many books, it may contain both entertainment and inſtruction. It will alſo be a remembrance to thoſe who have forgotten what they have read, and may ſerve as an epitome of univerſal hiſtory, particularly of that part which reſpects America.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:028800_0005_0FDD4ABC846DC618"/>To obviate the confuſion which would be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by blending all tranſactions, &amp;c. toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the editor has claſſed the different ſubjects under ſeparate heads, each ranged in alphabetical order, which mode of arrangement he hopes will, in various reſpects, be found more convenient than the other.</p>
            <p>Through every part of the work, the editor can with confidence aſſert, that he has anxiouſly endeavoured to render the information contained as intereſting and accurate as poſſible. Where he has ſailed in either of theſe reſpects, which he hopes has been ſeldom the caſe, he ſolicits the indulgence of a candid public.</p>

It was peopled by the natives of Germany, who croſſed the Rhine to invade the Gauls. The aſſemblies called the States General, firſt met 1302, and continued till 1614. This country had long been ſubject to the moſt deſpotic government, and their national debt had become ſo enormous, that it was impoſſible to pay the intereſt. The clamours of the public creditors and of the people at large, arreſted the attention of the court, and to appeaſe them, a meeting of repreſentatives of the Clergy, Nobility, and people was called, who convened at Paris, May 5, 1789. The <hi>Tiers etats</hi> or repreſentatives of the people, after uſing various effects to obtain an union with the clergy and nobility, without ſucceſs, declared themſelves the <hi>National Aſſembly,</hi> and proceeded to buſineſs, June 17, following; and on the 19th they were joined by a majority of the Clergy. On the 20th the repreſentatives of the people, were repulſed from the door of their uſual place of meeting, by an armed force ſent thither, by order of the court. Determined to perſevere in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation of France, they then aſſembled in a Tennis court, where, in the midſt of applauding thouſands, they took a ſolemn oath "never to ſeparate, till the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution ſhould be completed," on the 23d the king held, <hi>a royal ſeſſion,</hi> when he declared <hi>null</hi> the deliberations and reſolves of the 17th, and <hi>ordered</hi> the deputies im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to ſeparate and to appear before him next day.

When the king retired, he was followed by the nobility and a part of the clergy; but the deputies of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons remained on the benches, and declared "that they were there by the voice of the people, and that nothing ſhould expel them but the power of the bayonet." The Baſtille was taken by the national guards, and the governor and a number of other officers killed by the populace, on account of their perfidy, July 14. In November the Aſſembly aboliſhed the uſe of <hi>Lettres de Catchet,</hi> and the diſtinction of orders; on the 4th Feb. 1790, the king <hi>voluntarily</hi> appeared before the National Aſſembly, and declared, "that he would defend the new conſtitution to the laſt moment of his exiſtence;" and on June 20, 1791, as a proof of his ſincerity, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted privately with his family, from Paris, with a view, as was univerſally believed, of levying war againſt his country, and left a paper behind him, revoking all his proteſtations of attachment to the new conſtitution. He was, however, intercepted at Varennes and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted back to Paris, June 25; on July 17, a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of people aſſembled in the Champ de Mars, with the profeſſed deſign of petitioning, againſt the re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the king. Theſe were however diſperſed by the National guard under La Fayette, but not before 12 men were killed, and 50 or 60 wounded; on Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember 13, the king appeared in the Aſſembly and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly ſwore, "to be faithful to the nation and to the law, and to employ the powers veſted in him for the maintenance of the conſtitution, and the due execution of the law." The Aſſembly ſoon after paſſed a decree authoriſing the baniſhment of nonjuring prieſts, and another for the eſtabliſhment of a camp in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of Paris, to both of which the king gave his conſtitutional <hi>veto.</hi> From this unpopular meaſure, his flight, &amp;c. his attachment to the new order of things was much queſtioned; hence petitions were preſented to the aſſembly for his depoſition on 3d, 6th, and 7th of Auguſt 1792, in conſequence of which, and of the maſſacre at the Thuillieries on the 10th following, of

               <p>Switzerland, was formerly inhabited by the Helvetii who were ſubdued by Caeſar 57 B. C. It remained ſubject to the Romans, till it was conquered by the Alemans from Germany 395. Theſe, however, were driven out by Clovis I. of France 496, and Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land became part of the kingdom of Burgundy. Their mountainous, uninviting ſituation formed a better ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for their liberties, than their forts or armies, hence their ſubjection to Burgundy and Germany, was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, rather than real, till about the year 1300, when the Emperor Albert I. treated them with ſo much rigour, that they petitioned him againſt the cruelty of his governors. This, however, was ſo far from obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the deſired effect, that it only tended to double the hardſhips of the people, and one Greſsler an Auſtrian Governor, carried his tyranny ſo far, that he ſet up a hat upon a pole, to which he ordered the people to pay the ſame obeiſance as to himſelf. Incenſed at this treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Swiſs revolted, under William Tell, and formed a government for themſelves, on republican principles, 1315, which was ratified by the different powers of Europe 1649.</p>

               <p>United States of America. At the concluſion of the war in 1763, between Britain and France, the Britiſh colonies of North America, were in a ſtate of high po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:028800_0182_0FDD4C59B1756C38"/>
proſperity. Their population, commerce and wealth advanced with a rapid pace. Their internal go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was conducted with a degree of ſteadineſs, frugadity and wiſdom, which have been ſeldom, or, perhaps never equalled. But the war was ſcarcely finiſhed, when Britain attempted to reduce theſe colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to a ſtate of the moſt unconditional ſervitude. In March 1764, a bill was paſſed in the Britiſh parliament, by which heavy duties were laid on commodities im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, by the coloniſts, from ſuch Weſt India Iſlands, as did not belong to Britan, and another bill was ſoon ſoon after paſſed, to reſtrain the currency of paper money. The conſtant plea of the Americans, during the whole courſe of the controverſy, reſted upon this doctrine, that <hi>taxation without repreſentation,</hi> was but another name for ſlavery. Their complaints were loud; but the Britiſh parliament was ſo far from redreſſing their grievances, that on March 22, 1765, the ſtamp act followed. The pretended reaſon of theſe taxations was, that a ſum might be produced, ſufficient for the defence of the colonies againſt a foreign enemy. To this, the Americans anſwered, that they were fully able to defend themſelves, and that, at any rate, as they were not repreſented in the Britiſh parliament, that body had no right to tax them. To this reaſoning, however, the Britiſh miniſtry were inattentive; hence a tempeſt of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation burſt out, at once, all over the colonies: non-importation agreements were univerſally embraced, and, in conſequence of the general alarm, the firſt <hi>American Congreſs</hi> was held at New York 1765. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded at this oppoſition, the Britiſh cabinet ſhrunk from its uſurpation, and the ſtamp act was repealed. They, however, iſſued a declaratory bill, ſetting forth the authority of Britain, to bind the colonies, by laws and ſtatutes, in all caſes whatever. And in June 1767, a bill laying a duty on tea, paper, painted glaſs, and colours, was paſſed by parliament. This act excited ſtill more univerſal alarm and indignation, all over the continent, than even the ſtamp act itſelf. Troops arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:028800_0183_0FDD4C5B40BD25E0"/>
at Boſton, and it appeared to be the deſign of the Britiſh government, to <hi>dragoon</hi> the Americans, by mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary logic, into ſuch meaſures, as they thought proper. The coloniſts, however, remained firm, and the miniſtry repealed all the other parts of the obnoxious act, except the duty of 3<abbr>d</abbr> per lb. on tea: and this was left, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, what was called, <hi>the dignity of the crown.</hi> Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances multiplied, particularly in Maſſachuſſetts, and petitions, in the moſt reſpectful terms, were preſented to the king, which, however, were treated with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. In the midſt of this confuſion, three ſhips, laden with tea arrived Boſton and as, according to the act of parliament, it was ſubject to a duty of 3<abbr>d</abbr> per lb. 340 cheſts were deſtroyed by the populace, in November 1773. On March 25, 1774, the Boſton port-bill was paſſed by parliament, by which bill, that port was to be ſhut, from and after the firſt June enſuing, till ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction ſhould be made to the Eaſt India company for the tea deſtroyed. The Miniſtry had expected, that the other ſeaport towns, the commercial rivals of Boſton, would rejoice in her calamity, and that by having this opportunity of aggrandizing themſelves, the whole country would ſoon be reduced to ſubmiſſion. But here they were ſadly diſappointed, for contributions poured in from every quarter, and the whole continent of America was thrown into a ferment. On September 5, 1774, deputies met at Philadelphia, from the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent colonies, as the firſt General Congreſs, and, in November following, petitoned the king for a repeal of grievances, to which, it is unneceſſary to add, that no attention was paid. The firſt action between the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans and king's troops was, at Lexington, April 19. 1775. On May 20, following, the colonies agreed on Articles of confederation and perpetual union. June 16, General George Waſhington, was unanimouſly appointed commander in chief of the American army. July 6, Congreſs publiſhed a declaration, ſetting forth the cauſe and neceſſity of their taking up arms; and on July 4, 1776, in conſequence of the repeated provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:028800_0184_0FDD4C6177EA1258"/>
which the colonies had received from Britain, Congreſs declared theſe colonies to be free, ſovereign and independent, under the name of the UNITED STATES. The different battles they fought, to obtain their liberty, have been mentioned, under the head of <hi>battles, ſages, &amp;c.</hi> We ſhall, therefore only mention, that, after the ſurrender of Cornwallis, the reduction of America appeared impracticable to the Britiſh, and that, in conſequence, an addreſs was preſented to the king, againſt the further proſecution of offenſive war in America. On May 5, following, Sir Guy Carleton arrived at New York, with powers to treat of peace. On November 30, proviſional articles of peace were ſigned at Paris, between the American and Britiſh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, by which, the United States were declared, by the king of Britain to be free, ſovereign and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, and the definitive treaty was ratified by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, January 4, 1784. During the war, the articles of confederation had ſerved to keep the States united; but upon the return of peace, the general government was found, by no means to poſſeſs thoſe powers, which are neceſſary for the right adminiſtration of a well regulated republic. In 1785, Mr James Madiſon, at preſent a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative in Congreſs, brought forward a motion in the houſe of Delegates of Virginia, to appoint commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, who, in concurrence with others, to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the different States, ſhould form a ſyſtem of commercial regulations, to be recommended for adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the different State legiſlatures. In conſequence of this recommendation, commiſſioners from ſeveral of the States met at Annapolis in 1786; but finding that the States were generally not repreſented, and that the authority, given by ſuch as were, fell far ſhort of the objects to be accompliſhed, they agreed to requeſt of Congreſs, to recommend to the different States, to ſend deputies to a general convention, to be held at Philadelphia, in the following year, for the purpoſe of deviſing ſuch a form of government, as would beſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the welfare and happineſs of their conſtituents. In

May 1787, the Federal convention aſſembled, and on September 17, recommended to the different States the new conſtitution, or preſent ſyſtem of federal go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. This conſtitution underwent the moſt ſevere examination, and after a full diſcuſſion, in the different State conventions, was at laſt adopted by all. The new government was organized at New York, March 3, 1789, and George Waſhington was the firſt Preſident, John Adams the firſt Vice Preſident, and Frederic Auguſtus Muhlenburg the firſt ſpeaker of the houſe of repreſentatives. Under this excellent and hitherto wiſely adminiſtered conſtitution, the citizens of the United States have experienced a degree of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial and agricultural proſperity, unknown to other nations, and while the different governments of Europe, are at preſent convulſed to the very foundation, by the firm and temperate conduct of our Executive, we have ſtill enjoyed, that greateſt of all bleſſings, peace. One circumſtance alone has tended to interrupt our tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, viz, the inſurrection which broke out in the counties of Allegany, Waſhington, Fayette, and Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moreland in Pennſylvania, on account of the exciſe, in 1794, This, however, was happily ſuppreſſed by the prudence of the Preſident of the United States, and the good conduct of the militia, who, at his call, readily ſtepped forth in ſupport of the violated laws of their country, and order was reſtored without bloodſhed. Having given this curſory view of the foundation of the general government, we now proceed to the indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual States, taking them according to their geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical order, from North to South.</p>

A convention met for ſettling a conſtituion, September 1, 1779, and continued by adjournment until March 2, 1780, when they agreed on a conſtitution which was afterwards ratified by the general court, in June following.

We may add, that the Pennſylvania Society has the <hi>glory</hi> of having originated this ſyſtem of oppoſition to the traffic and commerce of our fellow creatures; and that from a very extenſive and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular correſpondence kept up between it, and thoſe founded on ſimilar principles, in the different parts of the world, there is every reaſon to believe that their efforts will be finally crowned with complete ſucceſs. The French conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has already declared liberty to all men without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Long debates have taken place in the Britiſh parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament on the ſame ſubject, and it is likely, that, by that government, the trade will be ſpeedily aboliſhed. In ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the American ſtates there are few, and in others no ſlaves. That there ſhould be any under a government of equal liberty, and which declares that all men are born alike free, muſt to the thinking part of mankind, excite aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but the preſent citizens of the United States are too enlightened, for a much longer time, to tolerate ſuch an enormity, which experience has confirmed to be ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of juſtice and morality, incompatible with ſound po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, repugnant to the principles of a republican govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and contradictory to the benevolent ſpirit of the Chriſtian religion.</p>

               <p>Plague, almoſt the whole world viſited by one 767 B. C.; one ſo dreadful at Rome, as to carry off 10,000 people in a day, 78; a terrible one all over Europe, Aſia, and Africa, which laſted near fifty years, 577; in England, which carried off 30,000 people, 772; in Scotland, which ſwept away 40,000 inhabitants, 954; in England 1025, 1247, and 1347; in Germany, which cut off 93,000 peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, 1348; in France and England very dreadful, 1362: again 1379; in London, which killed 30,000 perſons, 1407; again 1477 and in 1499, which cut off 30,000 people; throughout England ſo terrible, that half the people died, 1517; in London, which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried off 30,578 perſons, 1604; at Conſtantinople, when 200,000 perſons died, 1611; at London, which carried off 35,417 inhabitants, 1625; again 1631; at Lyons, in France, which carried off 60,000 peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, 1632. The great plague, as it was emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally called, at London, was brought there in ſome Levant goods, which came from Holland, about the cloſe of the year 1664. Theſe goods were carried
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:028800_0214_0FDD4CB61F1E4B18"/>
to a houſe near Drury Lane, where they were firſt opened, and here two Frenchmen died in a few days after. The diſorder ſpeedily communicated to other houſes in the neighbourhood, when ſeveral of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, being ſtruck with terror, removed to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent parts of the city, and thus the plague began to ſpread. Its further progreſs was checked by a hard froſt, which ſet in this winter, and continued till the month of March 1665, when its virulence again revived. As ſoon as the magiſtrates ſound that the contagion extended into different parts of the city, an order was iſſued for ſhutting up infected houſes, to ſtop the communication of the diſorder. Theſe houſes had red croſſes painted on the doors, with this inſcription, <hi>Lord, have mercy upon us!</hi> and watchmen were placed before them, to hand the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, neceſſaries and medicines, and to prevent them from coming abroad, until 40 days after their reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. But notwithſtanding every caution, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion continued to ſpread; ſo that in the firſt week of July the bills of mortality roſe to 725; the next week to 1089; the third week to 1843; and the next week to 2010: in Auguſt the deaths amounted to between 8 and 10,000 per week. Towards the fall, the diſorder became leſs frequent, and yielded to the force of medicine; and in the winter this great enemy of mankind received an effectual check. According to the bills of mortality, the number of burials this year was 97,306; of which number 68,596, were attributed to the plague. The regiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were, however, very inaccurately kept; and it was the opinion of eye-witneſſes, that at leaſt 100,000 periſhed by the plague.</p>
               <p>The great plague at Marſeilles, in France, was brought there from Syria, in May 1720; its progreſs was at firſt extremely ſlow, and the phyſicians, who had opened ſome dead bodies, and declared the dangerous nature of the diſorder, were inſulted by the rabble: nor was it, till the end of July, that the inhabitants began to perceive their danger. A variety of expedients were
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:028800_0215_0FDD4CB789CF8150"/>
then adopted to prevent the ſpreading of the diſtemper, as well as the progreſs of famine, which, likewiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſtare them in the face. Fires were kindled in different parts of the city, but, from experience, at Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles and other places, fires appear rather to have the effect of ſpreading, than checking the progreſs of conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious diſorders. On the 21ſt of Auguſt the number of dead increaſed ſo prodigiouſly, that the magiſtrates found it impracticable to get them carried out of town to be thrown into the pits: they were, therefore, under the neceſſity of getting the aſſiſtance of the galley ſlaves, and having them buried in the vaults of the church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards. In the month of September the diſeaſe raged with unabated fury; in the month of October, it began to decreaſe without any viſible cauſe. In November the contagion continued to decreaſe; and by the firſt of December, the danger was ſuppoſed to be at an end. It was not, however, entirely removed till the month of March following. The deaths were eſtimated at be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 50 and 60,000.</p>

The plague raged in the Levant, 1786; again 1791; carried off 300,000 people in Egypt, 1792; at Algiers, which carried off ſeveral of our <hi>American brethren,</hi> 1794; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the laſt accounts from Europe, it at preſent, 1795, rages in Turkey and Poland.

It began in Auguſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till the middle of September, when it totally diſappeared; during which ſhort time it cut off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 2 and 300 people.

our readers may not have had an opportunity of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſing the volumes which have been written on that diſorder, we ſhall here ſubjoin the following ſhort ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>account, which, we truſt, will prove acceptable to our readers.</p>
               <p>This diſorder made its firſt appearance towards the latter end of July, in a lodging houſe in North Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet; and for a few weeks ſeemed entirely confined to that vicinity. Hence it was generally ſuppoſed to have been imported, and not generated in the city. This was the opinion of Doctors Currie, Cathrall, and many others. It was however combated by Dr. Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin Ruſh, who aſſerts, that the contagion was genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the ſtench of a cargo of damaged coffee, which had been landed near the ſame place where it firſt made its appearances, on a ſuppoſition that vegetable putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction might produce ſuch a diſorder. For this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion he has given his reaſons at large, in a volume of which he has lately publiſhed the ſecond edition.</p>
               <p>As the moſt eminent phyſicians have differed on this ſubject, we ſhall not offend by hazarding an opinion. To thoſe who wiſh for particular information, we refer to their reſpective writings.</p>
               <p>But from whatever fountain we trace this poiſoned ſtream, it has deſtroyed the lives of many thouſands— and many of thoſe of the moſt diſtinguiſhed worth. Its characteriſtic or leading ſymptoms were ſudden debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the voluntary powers, oppreſſive pain, giddineſs, ſenſe of fullneſs and diſtention in the veſſels of the fore part of the head, and an oppreſſive weight about the heart and lungs, accompanied with great anguiſh and reſtleſſneſs. During the month of Auguſt, the funerals amounted to upwards of three hundred. The diſeaſe had then reached the central ſtreets of the city, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſpread on all ſides with the greateſt rapidity. In September its malignance increaſed amazingly. Fear pervaded the ſtouteſt heart; flight became general, and terror was depicted on every countenance. In this month 1400 more were added to the liſt of mortality. The contagion w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="217" facs="unknown:028800_0223_0FDD4CD3C6A556F8"/>
end of the month, 90 and 100 died daily. Until the middle of October, this mighty deſtroyer went on with increaſing havoc. From the 1ſt to the 17th, upwards of 1400 fell as victims to the tremendous malady. From the 17th to the 30th the mortality gradually decreaſed. In the whole month, however, the dead amounted to upwards of 2000—a dreadful number, if we conſider that at this time near one half of the inhabitants had fled. Before the diſorder became ſo terrible, the garlic which many chewed as a preventative, could be ſmelled at ſeveral yards diſtance; whilſt others hoped to avoid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection by a recourſe to ſmelling bottles, handkerchiefs dipped in vinegar, camphor bags, &amp;c. ſo that few indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals could be ſeen in the ſtreets without one or other of theſe applied to his noſtrils.</p>
               <p>At laſt, however, experience had proved that theſe were inefficacious. A reliance on Divine Providence ſucceeded, and in the moſt terrible ſtage of the diſorder the citizens diſcovered the moſt decent fortitude and the greateſt reſignation. Theſe imaginary preventatives were therefore thrown aſide.</p>
               <p>From the 1ſt to the 7th of November, the mortality gradually decreaſed. On the 9th, the burials, which had hitherto been ſo exceedingly numerous, were redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſix. The fugitive citizens now began to return, and the ſtreets reſumed their wonted life and activity.</p>
               <p>During this awful calamity, as has been already obſerved, terror and diſmay generally pervaded the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens. Some were found, however, who, at the riſque of their own lives, were highly inſtrumental in ſaving the lives of their fellow creatures. An hoſpital was erected at Buſhhill, at the diſtance of about one mile from the inhabited part of the city. Thither the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected were ſent in great numbers, but from? want of cleanlineſs and good order, the hoſpital and the grave were nearly the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>A committee had been appointed to aſſiſt the guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians of the poor in the legal diſcharge of their duty. It was one of the firſt objects of their care to remedy this evil. To ſearch into the horrors of this diſmal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:028800_0224_0FDD4CD4AFCF26A8"/>
required the fortitude of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>Howard.</hi> Men, however, ſtepped forth, and voluntarily undertook the arduous taſk. <hi>Stephen Girard,</hi> a native of France, a wealthy merchant of this city, and <hi>Peter Helm,</hi> a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Philadelphia, both members of the committee, offered their aſſiſtance. Thanks to Heaven! their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable lives were preſerved, and their generous la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours crowned with ſucceſs. The poor now no longer conſidered Buſhhill as the anti-chamber of the grave; but as a humane proviſion for the neceſſitous ſick: and now many recovered.</p>
               <p>So great a mortality of courſe left a great number of orphans in very deſtitute circumſtances. Here again was a large field of labour open for the benevolent. The children were to be provided with nurſes, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and other accommodations. The committee, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to their former burthens undertook this, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the Loganian library, which was fitted up as an orphan-houſe, where about two hundred children were admitted, ſixty of whom were infants.</p>
               <p>The accumulating expences of this inſtitution, with that of Buſhhill and many others, obviouſly required conſiderable ſums of money. Liberal contributions were ſent from different quarters, amounting in the whole to 29,085 dollars.</p>
               <p>During this melancholy period the city loſt ten of her moſt valuable phyſicians, and moſt of the others were ſick at different times. The number of deaths in all, amounted to about 5000.</p>
               <p>To omit recording the names of thoſe by whoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent exertions, under Divine Providence, the city was ſaved from utter deſtruction, would be highly culpable in any annaliſt. To perpetuate the <hi>falſely</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired fame of thoſe who have made themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous by butchering thouſands of their fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſtatues have been often erected; but what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, what ſtatues, what language can ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the merits of thoſe, who, at the imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of their own invaluable lives, have ſo eminently conduced to the ſafety of a great city?
