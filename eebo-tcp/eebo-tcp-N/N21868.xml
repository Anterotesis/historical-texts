            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>TO pre≈øent, at one view, a ≈øeries of the mo≈øt remarkable events, tran≈øactions, and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents which have occurred in ancient and modern times, and to tran≈ømit to po≈øterity the names and atchievements of great men, particularly of tho≈øe by who≈øe exertions, under Divine Providence, the United States enjoy their pre≈øent happy form of government, has been the principal de≈øign con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated in the pre≈øent publication.</p>
            <p>Through the whole of the following pages, the editor has ≈øelected his articles from hi≈øtorians of the fir≈øt rank, and from the mo≈øt authentic An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nali≈øts; hence he hopes, that his performance will be found u≈øeful to every cla≈øs of readers‚ÄîTo the ≈øtudent it may frequently ≈øave the trouble of turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over a number of volumes to refre≈øh his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; and to tho≈øe who≈øe lei≈øure cannot admit of the peru≈øal of many books, it may contain both entertainment and in≈øtruction. It will al≈øo be a remembrance to tho≈øe who have forgotten what they have read, and may ≈øerve as an epitome of univer≈øal hi≈øtory, particularly of that part which re≈øpects America.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:028800_0005_0FDD4ABC846DC618"/>To obviate the confu≈øion which would be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øioned by blending all tran≈øactions, &amp;c. toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the editor has cla≈ø≈øed the different ≈øubjects under ≈øeparate heads, each ranged in alphabetical order, which mode of arrangement he hopes will, in various re≈øpects, be found more convenient than the other.</p>
            <p>Through every part of the work, the editor can with confidence a≈ø≈øert, that he has anxiou≈øly endeavoured to render the information contained as intere≈øting and accurate as po≈ø≈øible. Where he has ≈øailed in either of the≈øe re≈øpects, which he hopes has been ≈øeldom the ca≈øe, he ≈øolicits the indulgence of a candid public.</p>

A new Empire, called the Parthian, was, however, founded on its ruins by the Per≈øians, under Arbaces 250 B. C.

               <p>Poland was once the country of the Vandals, who left it to invade the Roman empire. It was originally divided into many ≈ømall ≈øtates or principalities, almo≈øt independent of each other, though they generally had ≈øome prince, who was paramount over the re≈øt. About the year 700, the people, through the oppre≈ø≈øion of their petty chiefs, gave the ≈øupreme command, under the title of Duke, to Cracus, the founder of the city Cracow. This title was retained till the year 999, when Bole≈ølaus a≈ø≈øumed the appellation of king. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, no country has been more di≈øtracted by party or more injured by foreign influence than Poland. In the year 1773, it was partitioned by the combined

de≈øpots of Pru≈ø≈øia, Ru≈ø≈øia and Germany. From this di≈ømemberment, Poland found her≈øelf reduced to a humiliating ≈øtate of dependence on Ru≈ø≈øia, from which the patriots had, at different times, wi≈øhed to extricate their country.

               <p>United States of America. At the conclu≈øion of the war in 1763, between Britain and France, the Briti≈øh colonies of North America, were in a ≈øtate of high po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:028800_0182_0FDD4C59B1756C38"/>
pro≈øperity. Their population, commerce and wealth advanced with a rapid pace. Their internal go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was conducted with a degree of ≈øteadine≈øs, frugadity and wi≈ødom, which have been ≈øeldom, or, perhaps never equalled. But the war was ≈øcarcely fini≈øhed, when Britain attempted to reduce the≈øe colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to a ≈øtate of the mo≈øt unconditional ≈øervitude. In March 1764, a bill was pa≈ø≈øed in the Briti≈øh parliament, by which heavy duties were laid on commodities im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, by the coloni≈øts, from ≈øuch We≈øt India I≈ølands, as did not belong to Britan, and another bill was ≈øoon ≈øoon after pa≈ø≈øed, to re≈øtrain the currency of paper money. The con≈øtant plea of the Americans, during the whole cour≈øe of the controver≈øy, re≈øted upon this doctrine, that <hi>taxation without repre≈øentation,</hi> was but another name for ≈ølavery. Their complaints were loud; but the Briti≈øh parliament was ≈øo far from redre≈ø≈øing their grievances, that on March 22, 1765, the ≈øtamp act followed. The pretended rea≈øon of the≈øe taxations was, that a ≈øum might be produced, ≈øufficient for the defence of the colonies again≈øt a foreign enemy. To this, the Americans an≈øwered, that they were fully able to defend them≈øelves, and that, at any rate, as they were not repre≈øented in the Briti≈øh parliament, that body had no right to tax them. To this rea≈øoning, however, the Briti≈øh mini≈øtry were inattentive; hence a tempe≈øt of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation bur≈øt out, at once, all over the colonies: non-importation agreements were univer≈øally embraced, and, in con≈øequence of the general alarm, the fir≈øt <hi>American Congre≈øs</hi> was held at New York 1765. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded at this oppo≈øition, the Briti≈øh cabinet ≈øhrunk from its u≈øurpation, and the ≈øtamp act was repealed. They, however, i≈ø≈øued a declaratory bill, ≈øetting forth the authority of Britain, to bind the colonies, by laws and ≈øtatutes, in all ca≈øes whatever. And in June 1767, a bill laying a duty on tea, paper, painted gla≈øs, and colours, was pa≈ø≈øed by parliament. This act excited ≈øtill more univer≈øal alarm and indignation, all over the continent, than even the ≈øtamp act it≈øelf. Troops arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:028800_0183_0FDD4C5B40BD25E0"/>
at Bo≈øton, and it appeared to be the de≈øign of the Briti≈øh government, to <hi>dragoon</hi> the Americans, by mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary logic, into ≈øuch mea≈øures, as they thought proper. The coloni≈øts, however, remained firm, and the mini≈øtry repealed all the other parts of the obnoxious act, except the duty of 3<abbr>d</abbr> per lb. on tea: and this was left, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, what was called, <hi>the dignity of the crown.</hi> Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances multiplied, particularly in Ma≈ø≈øachu≈ø≈øetts, and petitions, in the mo≈øt re≈øpectful terms, were pre≈øented to the king, which, however, were treated with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. In the mid≈øt of this confu≈øion, three ≈øhips, laden with tea arrived Bo≈øton and as, according to the act of parliament, it was ≈øubject to a duty of 3<abbr>d</abbr> per lb. 340 che≈øts were de≈øtroyed by the populace, in November 1773. On March 25, 1774, the Bo≈øton port-bill was pa≈ø≈øed by parliament, by which bill, that port was to be ≈øhut, from and after the fir≈øt June en≈øuing, till ≈øatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction ≈øhould be made to the Ea≈øt India company for the tea de≈øtroyed. The Mini≈øtry had expected, that the other ≈øeaport towns, the commercial rivals of Bo≈øton, would rejoice in her calamity, and that by having this opportunity of aggrandizing them≈øelves, the whole country would ≈øoon be reduced to ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion. But here they were ≈øadly di≈øappointed, for contributions poured in from every quarter, and the whole continent of America was thrown into a ferment. On September 5, 1774, deputies met at Philadelphia, from the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent colonies, as the fir≈øt General Congre≈øs, and, in November following, petitoned the king for a repeal of grievances, to which, it is unnece≈ø≈øary to add, that no attention was paid. The fir≈øt action between the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans and king's troops was, at Lexington, April 19. 1775. On May 20, following, the colonies agreed on Articles of confederation and perpetual union. June 16, General George Wa≈øhington, was unanimou≈øly appointed commander in chief of the American army. July 6, Congre≈øs publi≈øhed a declaration, ≈øetting forth the cau≈øe and nece≈ø≈øity of their taking up arms; and on July 4, 1776, in con≈øequence of the repeated provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:028800_0184_0FDD4C6177EA1258"/>
which the colonies had received from Britain, Congre≈øs declared the≈øe colonies to be free, ≈øovereign and independent, under the name of the UNITED STATES. The different battles they fought, to obtain their liberty, have been mentioned, under the head of <hi>battles, ≈øages, &amp;c.</hi> We ≈øhall, therefore only mention, that, after the ≈øurrender of Cornwallis, the reduction of America appeared impracticable to the Briti≈øh, and that, in con≈øequence, an addre≈øs was pre≈øented to the king, again≈øt the further pro≈øecution of offen≈øive war in America. On May 5, following, Sir Guy Carleton arrived at New York, with powers to treat of peace. On November 30, provi≈øional articles of peace were ≈øigned at Paris, between the American and Briti≈øh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øioners, by which, the United States were declared, by the king of Britain to be free, ≈øovereign and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, and the definitive treaty was ratified by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈øs, January 4, 1784. During the war, the articles of confederation had ≈øerved to keep the States united; but upon the return of peace, the general government was found, by no means to po≈ø≈øe≈øs tho≈øe powers, which are nece≈ø≈øary for the right admini≈øtration of a well regulated republic. In 1785, Mr James Madi≈øon, at pre≈øent a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øentative in Congre≈øs, brought forward a motion in the hou≈øe of Delegates of Virginia, to appoint commi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øioners, who, in concurrence with others, to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the different States, ≈øhould form a ≈øy≈øtem of commercial regulations, to be recommended for adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the different State legi≈ølatures. In con≈øequence of this recommendation, commi≈ø≈øioners from ≈øeveral of the States met at Annapolis in 1786; but finding that the States were generally not repre≈øented, and that the authority, given by ≈øuch as were, fell far ≈øhort of the objects to be accompli≈øhed, they agreed to reque≈øt of Congre≈øs, to recommend to the different States, to ≈øend deputies to a general convention, to be held at Philadelphia, in the following year, for the purpo≈øe of devi≈øing ≈øuch a form of government, as would be≈øt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the welfare and happine≈øs of their con≈øtituents.

May 1787, the Federal convention a≈ø≈øembled, and on September 17, recommended to the different States the new con≈øtitution, or pre≈øent ≈øy≈øtem of federal go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. This con≈øtitution underwent the mo≈øt ≈øevere examination, and after a full di≈øcu≈ø≈øion, in the different State conventions, was at la≈øt adopted by all. The new government was organized at New York, March 3, 1789, and George Wa≈øhington was the fir≈øt Pre≈øident, John Adams the fir≈øt Vice Pre≈øident, and Frederic Augu≈øtus Muhlenburg the fir≈øt ≈øpeaker of the hou≈øe of repre≈øentatives. Under this excellent and hitherto wi≈øely admini≈øtered con≈øtitution, the citizens of the United States have experienced a degree of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial and agricultural pro≈øperity, unknown to other nations, and while the different governments of Europe, are at pre≈øent convul≈øed to the very foundation, by the firm and temperate conduct of our Executive, we have ≈øtill enjoyed, that greate≈øt of all ble≈ø≈øings, peace. One circum≈øtance alone has tended to interrupt our tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, viz, the in≈øurrection which broke out in the counties of Allegany, Wa≈øhington, Fayette, and We≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moreland in Penn≈øylvania, on account of the exci≈øe, in 1794, This, however, was happily ≈øuppre≈ø≈øed by the prudence of the Pre≈øident of the United States, and the good conduct of the militia, who, at his call, readily ≈øtepped forth in ≈øupport of the violated laws of their country, and order was re≈øtored without blood≈øhed. Having given this cur≈øory view of the foundation of the general government, we now proceed to the indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual States, taking them according to their geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical order, from North to South.</p>

That there ≈øhould be any under a government of equal liberty, and which declares that all men are born alike free, mu≈øt to the thinking part of mankind, excite a≈øtoni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but the pre≈øent citizens of the United States are too enlightened, for a much longer time, to tolerate ≈øuch an enormity, which experience has confirmed to be ≈øubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øive of ju≈øtice and morality, incompatible with ≈øound po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, repugnant to the principles of a republican govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and contradictory to the benevolent ≈øpirit of the Chri≈øtian religion.</p>

               <p>Plague, almo≈øt the whole world vi≈øited by one 767 B.

The≈øe goods were carried

to a hou≈øe near Drury Lane, where they were fir≈øt opened, and here two Frenchmen died in a few days after. The di≈øorder ≈øpeedily communicated to other hou≈øes in the neighbourhood, when ≈øeveral of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, being ≈øtruck with terror, removed to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent parts of the city, and thus the plague began to ≈øpread. Its further progre≈øs was checked by a hard fro≈øt, which ≈øet in this winter, and continued till the month of March 1665, when its virulence again revived. As ≈øoon as the magi≈øtrates ≈øound that the contagion extended into different parts of the city, an order was i≈ø≈øued for ≈øhutting up infected hou≈øes, to ≈øtop the communication of the di≈øorder. The≈øe hou≈øes had red cro≈ø≈øes painted on the doors, with this in≈øcription, <hi>Lord, have mercy upon us!</hi> and watchmen were placed before them, to hand the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, nece≈ø≈øaries and medicines, and to prevent them from coming abroad, until 40 days after their reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. But notwith≈øtanding every caution, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion continued to ≈øpread; ≈øo that in the fir≈øt week of July the bills of mortality ro≈øe to 725; the next week to 1089; the third week to 1843; and the next week to 2010: in Augu≈øt the deaths amounted to between 8 and 10,000 per week. Towards the fall, the di≈øorder became le≈øs frequent, and yielded to the force of medicine; and in the winter this great enemy of mankind received an effectual check. According to the bills of mortality, the number of burials this year was 97,306; of which number 68,596, were attributed to the plague. The regi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were, however, very inaccurately kept; and it was the opinion of eye-witne≈ø≈øes, that at lea≈øt 100,000 peri≈øhed by the plague.</p>
               <p>The great plague at Mar≈øeilles, in France, was brought there from Syria, in May 1720; its progre≈øs was at fir≈øt extremely ≈ølow, and the phy≈øicians, who had opened ≈øome dead bodies, and declared the dangerous nature of the di≈øorder, were in≈øulted by the rabble: nor was it, till the end of July, that the inhabitants began to perceive their danger. A variety of expedients were
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:028800_0215_0FDD4CB789CF8150"/>
then adopted to prevent the ≈øpreading of the di≈øtemper, as well as the progre≈øs of famine, which, likewi≈øe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ≈øtare them in the face. Fires were kindled in different parts of the city, but, from experience, at Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeilles and other places, fires appear rather to have the effect of ≈øpreading, than checking the progre≈øs of conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious di≈øorders. On the 21≈øt of Augu≈øt the number of dead increa≈øed ≈øo prodigiou≈øly, that the magi≈øtrates found it impracticable to get them carried out of town to be thrown into the pits: they were, therefore, under the nece≈ø≈øity of getting the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of the galley ≈ølaves, and having them buried in the vaults of the church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards. In the month of September the di≈øea≈øe raged with unabated fury; in the month of October, it began to decrea≈øe without any vi≈øible cau≈øe. In November the contagion continued to decrea≈øe; and by the fir≈øt of December, the danger was ≈øuppo≈øed to be at an end. It was not, however, entirely removed till the month of March following. The deaths were e≈øtimated at be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 50 and 60,000.</p>

our readers may not have had an opportunity of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ru≈øing the volumes which have been written on that di≈øorder, we ≈øhall here ≈øubjoin the following ≈øhort ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>account, which, we tru≈øt, will prove acceptable to our readers.</p>
               <p>This di≈øorder made its fir≈øt appearance towards the latter end of July, in a lodging hou≈øe in North Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtreet; and for a few weeks ≈øeemed entirely confined to that vicinity. Hence it was generally ≈øuppo≈øed to have been imported, and not generated in the city. This was the opinion of Doctors Currie, Cathrall, and many others. It was however combated by Dr. Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin Ru≈øh, who a≈ø≈øerts, that the contagion was genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the ≈øtench of a cargo of damaged coffee, which had been landed near the ≈øame place where it fir≈øt made its appearances, on a ≈øuppo≈øition that vegetable putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction might produce ≈øuch a di≈øorder. For this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion he has given his rea≈øons at large, in a volume of which he has lately publi≈øhed the ≈øecond edition.</p>
               <p>As the mo≈øt eminent phy≈øicians have differed on this ≈øubject, we ≈øhall not offend by hazarding an opinion. To tho≈øe who wi≈øh for particular information, we refer to their re≈øpective writings.</p>
               <p>But from whatever fountain we trace this poi≈øoned ≈øtream, it has de≈øtroyed the lives of many thou≈øands‚Äî and many of tho≈øe of the mo≈øt di≈øtingui≈øhed worth. Its characteri≈øtic or leading ≈øymptoms were ≈øudden debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the voluntary powers, oppre≈ø≈øive pain, giddine≈øs, ≈øen≈øe of fullne≈øs and di≈øtention in the ve≈ø≈øels of the fore part of the head, and an oppre≈ø≈øive weight about the heart and lungs, accompanied with great angui≈øh and re≈øtle≈ø≈øne≈øs. During the month of Augu≈øt, the funerals amounted to upwards of three hundred. The di≈øea≈øe had then reached the central ≈øtreets of the city, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ≈øpread on all ≈øides with the greate≈øt rapidity. In September its malignance increa≈øed amazingly. Fear pervaded the ≈øtoute≈øt heart; flight became general, and terror was depicted on every countenance.

end of the month, 90 and 100 died daily. Until the middle of October, this mighty de≈øtroyer went on with increa≈øing havoc. From the 1≈øt to the 17th, upwards of 1400 fell as victims to the tremendous malady. From the 17th to the 30th the mortality gradually decrea≈øed. In the whole month, however, the dead amounted to upwards of 2000‚Äîa dreadful number, if we con≈øider that at this time near one half of the inhabitants had fled. Before the di≈øorder became ≈øo terrible, the garlic which many chewed as a preventative, could be ≈ømelled at ≈øeveral yards di≈øtance; whil≈øt others hoped to avoid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection by a recour≈øe to ≈ømelling bottles, handkerchiefs dipped in vinegar, camphor bags, &amp;c. ≈øo that few indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals could be ≈øeen in the ≈øtreets without one or other of the≈øe applied to his no≈øtrils.</p>
               <p>At la≈øt, however, experience had proved that the≈øe were inefficacious. A reliance on Divine Providence ≈øucceeded, and in the mo≈øt terrible ≈øtage of the di≈øorder the citizens di≈øcovered the mo≈øt decent fortitude and the greate≈øt re≈øignation. The≈øe imaginary preventatives were therefore thrown a≈øide.</p>
               <p>From the 1≈øt to the 7th of November, the mortality gradually decrea≈øed. On the 9th, the burials, which had hitherto been ≈øo exceedingly numerous, were redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ≈øix. The fugitive citizens now began to return, and the ≈øtreets re≈øumed their wonted life and activity.</p>
               <p>During this awful calamity, as has been already ob≈øerved, terror and di≈ømay generally pervaded the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens. Some were found, however, who, at the ri≈øque of their own lives, were highly in≈øtrumental in ≈øaving the lives of their fellow creatures. An ho≈øpital was erected at Bu≈øhhill, at the di≈øtance of about one mile from the inhabited part of the city. Thither the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected were ≈øent in great numbers, but from? want of cleanline≈øs and good order, the ho≈øpital and the grave were nearly the ≈øame thing.</p>
               <p>A committee had been appointed to a≈ø≈øi≈øt the guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians of the poor in the legal di≈øcharge of their duty. It was one of the fir≈øt objects of their care to remedy this evil. To ≈øearch into the horrors of this di≈ømal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle

               <p>The accumulating expences of this in≈øtitution, with that of Bu≈øhhill and many others, obviou≈øly required con≈øiderable ≈øums of money. Liberal contributions were ≈øent from different quarters, amounting in the whole to 29,085 dollars.</p>
