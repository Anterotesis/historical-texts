            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>In the time of the revolution war I lost two houses by fire, from accidents; and living on a navigable river, the house in which I then resided was beset in the night by a number of armed men. Their numbers could not be known, nor could they be repelled from within, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than by first opening the door. They were let in upon terms. The house was badly constructed for defence; and I always disliked the common mode of building, with combustible materials, without reserve, especially in the roofs. The annexed drawing, of a plan and elevation, may afford hints to persons who would build near rivers, or would effectually guard against fire. It is not here the intention to give a design to be particularly followed; but <hi>principles</hi> only on which others may build to suit themselves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Delicate people, used to dry warm houses of the towns, seldom take a cold on sleeping in log pens or houses having <hi>damp earthen floors,</hi> when they travel in the frontier of the country.</p>
            <p>Court houses and other stone or brick buildings, which are not airy, when shut up for some time, contain a somewhat stagnant unelastic damp air, which is also un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholesome: but this is not at all the case of <hi>inhabited, much-frequented,</hi> or <hi>airy</hi> houses; when the air has some degree of current, and is all <hi>alive.</hi>

               </gap> houses of the ancient civilized world had, and most of the Asiatic and African houses on the coast of the Mediterranean sea, still have platform roofs. The houses in Algiers are all so, and of one height; so that the ladies visit from house to house and street to street, by walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the roofs of the houses. Platform roofs are cheaper than common ridge-roofs, shingled; and are safer against fire inside and out, and against the pressure of wind. Most houses burnt in country places take fire in the roofs whilst the family is gone on visits or to church. Then it is that children or servants take candles or light-wood to rummage closets, cuddies, and cock-lofts, which usually are lumbered with combustibles: or flakes of burning soot fall on the shingled roof.</p>
            <p>A platform roof may be thus constructed. Joists 12 or 13 inches deep at the big end, are to rest on the middle wall, and from thence slope two-tenths of an inch per foot to the smaller end on the exterior wall. Their thickness 2 5-10 or three inches. The distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them 12 or 14 inches, from centre to centre. Or the joists may be equally deep from end to end; and bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens which slope are to be fixed on the joists, for forming the platform roof with the said degree of slope. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the joists, at every five or six feet, fix to the joists at right angles, pieces of plank, nearly the depth of the joists. These would add to the strength of the joists, as so many braces, preventing their weakness laterally. Stout,

This covering is so light, that very little timber is requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the roof."</p>
            <p>Objections readily occur to new projects; and it is right that they should be well weighed and considered. It is said platform-roofs may answer in southern climates; but that in our more northern country, the weight of snow would be too great to be borne. This objection has the less force with me, who have had some experience on this head. I covered a house, thirty-six feet square, with a flat roof which sloped about a quarter of an inch to a foot The joists of poplar were two feet apart; nine inches deep at the upper end (the ridge of the roof) and about six and a half inches at the small end, where they rested on a wall. From the ridge to this wall was ten feet in length, and the joists from thence continued taper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing further eight feet, where they rested on a plate sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by brick pillars. Pine sawed laths, inch thick, were nailed across the joists. Common weak oyster-shell mortar, from old Indian collections of shells, was laid on the laths, three-fourths of an inch thick. Tiles six quarters of an inch thick were bedded in the mortar. The joints were filled with tar and sand; and the tiles and joints were covered and filled with half stuff, on which sand was strewed thick and rolled A gust of wind carried off most of the sand. Then again half-stuff and sheath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paper were laid on, and upon the paper half-stuff, sand and pebbles. Gusts of wind blew most of the paper off. It remained only on the roof over one of the rooms; which was tight, excepting in one place, where rains poured through, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>The leaking in this experiment was the more excessive, from the mortar being made of rotten shells; which made an imperfect cement: and moreover, too much was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from tar and pitch, as resisters of water; when in fact they let it through rapidly; until mixed with fish-oil, which proved to be a perfect corrector: neither was the paper properly fixed; for it could not be nailed down. Though the joists were of a brittle wood, slender and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant from each other, yet the span from wall to wall was but about nine feet.</p>
            <p>In the annexed plan is a main partition wall, across where the chimney is, from whence the joists extend 21 feet to the exterior wall. The weight of extraordinary quantities of snow and heat often repeated in the course of a winter, is to be guarded against. If there was no chance of omission to shovel off the snow every time it should fall, less strength would be requisite: but there probably would be neglect in this; or the house might happen to be uninhabited during some winter or other; I would therefore have the joists strong and numerous, and the joists immediately below those of the roof, should be made to bear some portion of the weight, by planks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the lower and upper joists; which are to be about two feet, the depth of the space <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

So that if one story requires a wall 1 brick thick, two stories may have the basement 1 ½, and three stories 2 bricks thick: or say 1 ½, 2, 2 ½ bricks thick, the basement or first stories. The foundation wall should be three feet in the ground, for gaining firmness and to be out of the reach of severe frost.</p>
            <p>It may be sufficient for some families, and best suit their purposes to have but <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two</hi> stories of rooms. The lower the walls the stronger. It would be no great task to force water up, every evening in summer, for cooling the roof and other purposes. At Algiers, much of the women's work is done on the roof, where water is always at hand. They especially wash and dry their linen there. In Spain, they have their cloacas on the platform roof; where also are two cisterns of water: one for the use of the cook, the other for more common purposes, washing, &amp;c. From this the pipes of the cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas are sluiced. At Cadiz, water is received into the cis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns on the tops of the houses, from reservoirs or heads of water on the hills out of the town. Water might be raised to a head at the top of Mr. Morris's Quarry Hill, on the Schuylkill, for supplying reservoirs on the tops of the houses in Philadelphia. Consult ingenious men. The tide falling eight feet; and running 2 5-10ths miles in an hour, at least equal to the walking of horses in mill-work, could not works be so constructed that the impetus of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of that river should move a wheel (I think a horizontal

            <p>Construction of chimnies to the best advantage is very important; yet, till lately, the principles have been but little understood. Mr. Peale, of the Museum in Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, has given me some account of the fine effects of his patent improvements, and says, that
<q>Fire-places which were used to smoke, on his principles are cured of smoking; and such entire command is had of the draught of air, that with but little of attention to the state of the fire, as to its burning clear or not, by moving the sliding mantle downward for increasing the draught, then returning it for letting the heat into the room, and closing the valve in the throat of the chimney, just far enough for carrying off the watery particles of the fuel, only a small portion of the heat is suffered to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape up the chimney: consequently with very little consumption of fuel, even large rooms may be kept comfortable in the coldest seasons, as during the last winter he continually experienced; and the house is perfectly secure from any fire left in the fire-place at night.</q>
I have in the late winter seen one of Mr. Peale's fire-places in its improved state, where the room was uncommonly large, 26 by 25 feet square and 15 feet
<pb n="13"
                   facs="unknown:033435_0016_0FF74754A8B6C678"

high. On inquiry, it was ascertained to me that during the winter only small fires were kept burning from the morning, about seven o'clock till nine or ten at night, when it was let go down, and the family left the room to go to bed; that it preserved a warmth, not less than 48 of Farenheit, in the room till the fire was renewed next morning; and this was the case in the coldest nights, when out of doors the thermometer was at 10 degrees. That in the day the heat was steadily kept at about 60 degrees. There is, next door to mine, a fire-place very noted for smoking. After many vain attempts to cure it, it was closed up with brick-work, plaistered over, and so remained till lately, when Mr. Peale directed his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements to be applied to it. Now it is perfectly free from smoking in the very worst of winds and weather. What further proved to me the due portion of heat hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been steadily preserved in Mr. Peale's above room, during the winter, was the high perfection in which, in March, I saw in it a collection of green house-plants, oranges, &amp;c. that had stood there the winter through. The room had two windows fronting westerly, and two south<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly, and I never saw green house-plants more perfectly kept.</p>
