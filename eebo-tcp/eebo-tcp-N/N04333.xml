            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE Epiſtle, out of which I have taken the Text, was ſent by <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus.</hi> It would take up too much of the Time allow'd me, to enter upon the Character of this eminent Servant of GOD; eſpecially in his Capacity as an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer in the Church of CHRIST, under which Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and not as a private Chriſtian, he is here wrote to.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only ſay, he was one of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Converts, a Fellow-Labourer with him in the Kingdom and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of JESUS CHRIST, and his Companion in Travels. It was with <hi>Paul</hi> that he went to <hi>Crete</hi>; and by him he was left there to ſerve the Ends of the Goſpel. Some ſay, he was now conſtituted <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Crete</hi>; but 'tis remarkable, he is not ſpoken of as the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of this Place, by any of the Fathers within the three firſt Centuries: Nor does the Scripture at all favour ſuch
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005357_0005_101728E237873D90"/>
a Notion. It rather repreſents him as tarrying here on ſome <hi>temporary</hi> Occaſion, than as a <hi>fixt Officer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Story is thus,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> upon their coming to <hi>Crete,</hi> found Things in a very unſettled State. For though conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Numbers had embraced Chriſtianity, they had too much neglected <hi>Order.</hi> They had few or no <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained</hi> Elders among them; and, perhaps, were not as yet formed into diſtinct Churches: Or, if this was the Caſe, they had not got into a <hi>regular State,</hi> without which 'tis impoſſible Societies ſhould ſubſiſt long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out falling into Confuſion. Now, <hi>for this Cauſe</hi> it was, that <hi>Titus was left in Crete, that he might ſet in Order the Things that were wanting, and ordain Elders in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry City:</hi> Which, when he had done, the more ſpecial End of his Continuance in this Place was anſwered, and he might travel elſewhere, as in all Probability he did.</p>
            <p>But however this be, his being at <hi>Crete,</hi> in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of CHRIST, and under peculiar Circumſtances of Difficulty, was the Occaſion of <hi>Paul</hi>'s writing this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to him; in which, many are the Advices he gives him for the Direction of his Conduct, as one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the Management of the Affairs of CHRIST's Kingdom.</p>
            <p>He is very particular in minding him of the <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Qualifications</hi> for the ſacred Office, that he might put none into it, who were not fit for ſo important a Truſt. And he the rather choſe to enlarge upon this Head, as <hi>many unruly and Vain-talkers and Deceivers</hi> were ſcattered up and down, <hi>ſubverting whole Houſes, and teaching Things they ought not for filthy Lucre's Sake.</hi> It may ſeem ſtrange, that, in the Days of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> there ſhould be ſuch Numbers of <hi>falſe Teachers</hi>: But ſo it was in Fact; yea, and they were grown to ſuch
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005357_0006_101729368F552FA8"/>
an Height in <hi>Impudence,</hi> even in thoſe primitive Times, that they could exalt themſelves above the very <hi>Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles.</hi> And in Order to this, they were ſo far Maſters in the Art of Deceit, as to <hi>transform themſelves into Angels of Light:</hi> Nor did they ſtick at any Thing, ſo they could but leſſen the <hi>Apoſtolic</hi> Reputation, and wind themſelves into the Affections of the Populace. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſeems very ſollicitous, that the Church might be rid of theſe <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>dangerous Teachers</hi>; and, as the beſt Expedient to this End, directs, that none might have committed to them the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel, but <hi>well qualified</hi> Perſons; one eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Requiſite in whoſe Character he has declared muſt be that, <hi>able, by ſound Doctrine, both to exhort and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the Gainſayers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon which it is natural to remark, if none are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to be intruſted with the Miniſtry but thoſe who have <hi>Ability to convince Gain-ſayers,</hi> it muſt certainly be the Duty of ſuch, when they are in the Miniſtry, to make Uſe of this <hi>Ability</hi> againſt thoſe, who <hi>teach Things which they ought not.</hi> How elſe will they anſwer one of the expreſs Ends of their being put into the ſacred Office? And to what Purpoſe is it, that this <hi>Ability</hi> muſt be found in them, if 'tis not their Duty to make Uſe of it, as the Occaſion of the Church ſhall render it needful?</p>
            <p>But among all the Directions given to <hi>Titus,</hi> for his Conduct as a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> there is no one of more Weight than that in the Text, <hi>Let no Man deſpiſe thee.</hi> And 'tis of common Obligation on all, whom it has pleaſed God to put into the Miniſtry. They ſhould all behave ſo as not to be deſpiſed, ſo as to give no <hi>juſt Occaſion</hi> to be ſo. That's the Meaning of the Words. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, Miniſters would have a hard Taſk indeed. Their Duty would be an utter Impoſſibility. For 'tis not in their Power, though they ſhould be <hi>as wiſe as
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005357_0007_101728E418C40AC8"/>
Serpents, and harmleſs as Doves,</hi> to paſs through the World, and not be deſpiſed, They may, through the Supply of the SPIRIT of JESUS CHRIST, behave ſo circumſpectly and inoffenſively, as that none may have Reaſon to treat them with Contempt; but they can't command the Wills of other Men, they have not the Government of their Paſſions, or Prejudices, or Luſts. The GREAT SAVIOUR himſelf, though a Prophet of unſpotted Innocence, was yet <hi>deſpiſed of Men.</hi> And <hi>ſhall the Diſciple be above his</hi> LORD? Shall the World vilify the MASTER, and the <hi>Servant</hi> be better treated? The Spirit of too many is ſuch, that we may expect, be we as cautious as we will, to be derided. And this indeed ſeems to be implied in the Text it ſelf. The Exhortation, <hi>Let no Man deſpiſe thee,</hi> plainly ſuppoſes a too great Proneneſs in People to treat Miniſters with Contempt; and their Duty lies, not in People's not deſpiſing them, but in not deſerving their Contempt, in doing nothing that may lay a juſt Foundation for it.</p>
            <p>In further ſpeaking to the Text, I ſhall,</p>
            <p n="1">I. Say ſomething of that <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> there is in <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> to deſpiſe the Miniſters of CHRIST.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Show wherein they ſhould take Care to avoid the <hi>Occaſions</hi> of Contempt.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Repreſent the <hi>Obligations</hi> which lie upon them to ſuch a Care.</p>
            <p>The whole will then be followed with ſome ſutable <hi>Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. I am, in the firſt Place, to ſpeak of that <hi>Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> there is in <hi>People</hi> to deſpiſe the Miniſters of CHRIST. Not that I would inſinuate, as if they were generally faulty in this Reſpect. Many there are, GOD be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who acknowledge the ſpecial Relation they bear to JESUS CHRIST, and treat them as <hi>Stewards of the Myſteries of GOD; eſteeming them highly in Love,</hi> both
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005357_0008_101729382DFE98E0"/>
for their <hi>Office,</hi> and <hi>Work's Sake.</hi> And ſome, it may be, think more highly of them than is meet. Thoſe, to be ſure, do ſo, who have their <hi>Perſons in Admiration</hi>; blindly receiving all they ſay, as though it were infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Truth. This is doing them too much Honour; yea, 'tis placing them in the Room of CHRIST, and calling them <hi>Maſter</hi> in Oppoſition to the <hi>one Maſter in Heaven. Brethren,</hi> we renounce all claim to ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due Reverence. We don't pretend to <hi>have Dominion over your Faith,</hi> but only to be <hi>Helpers of your Joy.</hi> And inſtead of an implicit Faith in our Dictates, we commend to you the Example of the noble <hi>Bereans,</hi> who <hi>ſearched the Scriptures daily,</hi> to ſee whether the Things taught them were the Truths of GOD, yea, or nay: Nor dare we adviſe you to <hi>hold faſt</hi> what we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver to you, in the Courſe of our Preaching, only as you perceive it to be <hi>good,</hi> upon full <hi>Proof</hi> from the Word of CHRIST. <hi>To the Law, and to the Teſtimony:</hi> If what we ſay does not agree herewith, there is no Light nor Truth in it.</p>
            <p>You may, perhaps, have conceiv'd ſo high an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the uncommon Sanctity of ſome particular Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, in Diſtinction from others, and the divine Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings they are under, as to ſuppoſe them to have got beyond all Danger of Miſtakes; you may be ready to think it impoſſible you ſhould err, while you follow the Inſtructions of Men filled with ſuch extraordinary Meaſures of the HOLY GHOST: But you ought to remember, 'tis not always thoſe who make the greateſt Pretences to the SPIRIT, who are moſt favoured with his <hi>real</hi> Influences; nor are any ſince the Days of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, ſo led by the SPIRIT as to be infallible. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las! the beſt qualified Miniſters are but Men; Men of <hi>like Paſſions</hi> with your ſelves: And of this they too often give Proof by the Errors they run into, in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple as well as Practice. They may not therefore be depended on, as though you could not be miſguided by
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005357_0009_101728EEF100F7B8"/>
them. Be their Gifts, or Graces, or Zeal, what they will; or let their Pretences to the <hi>immediate</hi> Conduct of the Divine SPIRIT be as peremptory as they will, you muſt not believe this, or the other Thing, to be the Truth, as it is in JESUS, upon their Authority: No, but you muſt bring what they ſay, with an unprejudic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mind, to the HOLY BIBLE; cloſing in with it, or rejecting it, as you find it, upon Trial, to agree or diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with that <hi>one only Teſt</hi> of all religious Truth: Nor will you otherwiſe be able to excuſe your ſelves ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Day. It won't then ſuffice to plead, that you were told this, or that, by thoſe you eſteemed Men <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily</hi> aſſiſted by the SPIRIT; for you had the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to repair to, and might have examined what they ſaid by that ſacred and unerring Rule: Which, if you neglected to do, believing <hi>Man</hi> rather than GOD, how will you hold up your Heads? 'Twon't leſſen, but aggravate your Fault, to pretend you ſubmitted your Conſciences to meer humane Dictates; for it will then appear, that your embracing any Thing for a Truth of GOD, upon any Authority ſhort of his, was ſetting up that Authority in his Throne, and paying that Honour to the Creature, which is due only to the Creator.</p>
            <p>But if there are ſome, who riſe too high in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to Miniſters, are there not others, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Extreme, who fall as much too low? And is not this the Spirit evidently prevailing at this Day? Are there not many who vilify the Office it ſelf, treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with Sneer and Ridicule? And what Wonder, if the Perſons of Miniſters don't eſcape the Scorn and Contempt of ſuch? They have indeed a pitiful Tho't of all of this Profeſſion; and ſpare none, though of the moſt ſhining Accompliſhments. If they know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more of a Man than that he is a Miniſter, 'tis enough with them to finiſh his Character: This alone will give them a low mean Opinion of him; though without either Candour or Juſtice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:005357_0010_1017293CAF107A28"/>Not but that there have been, among the <hi>Clergy,</hi> both <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>vicious</hi> Men. It would be a ſtrange Thing indeed if their hadn't. But why muſt the whole Order ſuffer Reproach on this Account? Is this fair? Is it thought to be ſo in other Profeſſions? If there are any who make themſelves vile, let them bear all the Indignity they deſerve: But where is the Equity of blaming the Innocent with the Guilty? Are there not Men of Worth in the ſacred Function, as well as in other Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments? Men of Capacity and Integrity, yea, and of extenſive Uſefulneſs, through their abundant La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in the Cauſe of GOD? And ſhall they all, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, be condemned, and by the Lump too, as a Parcel of ſimple, or elſe crafty and deſigning Men?</p>
            <p>This, I know, has ſometimes been ſuggeſted, if not plainly ſpoken out, to the Prejudice of their Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and with all the Embelliſhments of Wit and Railery. But if Men, profeſſedly of no Principles, are Enemies to thoſe, whoſe Buſineſs it is to plead the Cauſe of Virtue and true Religion, what is it more than might be expected? Nor would they act up to their Character, if, rather than not aſperſe them, they did not make a handle of any Thing; and inſtead of ſolid Argument exert themſelves in prophane Banter.</p>
            <p>I may not impertinently add here, 'Tis not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong atheiſtical vicious Men that Miniſters are treated with Contempt. They have appear'd ſtrangely prone to deſpiſe one another, and to take all Occaſions to do ſo; and this has been too much their Way, in all Places, and Ages of the World. If ſome Miniſters han't had Light to think, or ſpeak, juſt as ſome others would have them, how commonly have they been the Objects of their Contempt? What Names of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny and Reproach have been caſt upon them? And how has the Spirit of Contempt been propagated from Miniſters to People, to the great Hindrance of the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005357_0011_101728F090524C88"/>
Goſpel? Perhaps, ſome of the Miniſters of CHRIST, and it may be as faithful Miniſters as any in the Goſpel-Church, have ſuffered more from their own Brethren, and ſuch among the People as have been ſet on Fire by them, than they ever have, even from foul-mouth'd Infidels. Says the excellent Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> ſpeaking of the Sectaries of his Day, <q>They have quite out-ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the <hi>profane Scorners</hi> of the Miniſtry.—By ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Years Experience in converſing with theſe Men, I can ſpeak it knowingly, that the chiefeſt of their Zeal is let out againſt the faithful Miniſters of CHRIST. He is the ableſt of their Preachers, that can rail at them in the vileſt Language. It is their moſt common Diſcourſe, in all Companies, both god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and profane, to vilify the Miniſtry, and make them odious to all; partly, by Slanders, and partly by Scorns. Is this the Way to win Souls? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as formerly they thought, that if a Man were won to a Love of the Miniſtry, and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he was in a hopeful Way of being won to God; now theſe Men are diligent to bring all Men to ſcorn them, as if this were all that was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the ſaving of their Souls, and he only ſhall be happy, that can deride at Miniſters and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. He adds, If any Man doubt of the Truth of what I ſay, he is a Stranger in <hi>England.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I will not go about to draw a Parallel between the late Times in this Land, and thoſe referred to by this pious and learned Writer; but thus much I may be allow'd to ſay, that the <hi>Body of the Miniſters</hi> were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver treated with more Inſult and Contempt than by Multitudes, and of thoſe too, who once eſteemed them the Glory of <hi>New-England</hi>: Nor were they ever more hardly cenſured than by ſome of their <hi>own Order,</hi> from whom they might have expected better Things. It will not be denied, that they have had all Manner of Evil ſpoken againſt them, and this, in the Face of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005357_0012_101728F25FCFE3F0"/>
crowded Auditories. And are there not Numbers, in many Places, who have learned, from their admired Teachers, to give them no better Names than <hi>Phariſees, blind Leaders of the Blind, Oppoſers of</hi> CHRIST, and what not? And han't this Contempt been thrown upon as valuable Miniſters as any the LORD JESUS CHRIST has in the Country, of as known <hi>Soundneſs in the Faith,</hi> and as <hi>exemplary a Walk</hi> in Conformity to the Precepts of the Goſpel?</p>
            <p>Let us not be diſcouraged, my <hi>Brethren</hi>; what tho' we are deſpiſed, not only by Men of no Religion, but thoſe who pretend to a great Deal? This was the Lot of <hi>inſpired Apoſtles</hi>; yea, of JESUS CHRIST himſelf: And it has often been the Lot of his moſt faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ever ſince. Meerly our being deſpiſed, is not our <hi>Fault,</hi> tho' it may be our <hi>Unhappineſs.</hi> The Fault is, to deſerve Contempt; and we cannot, it muſt be own'd, be too much upon our Guard, that there may be no juſt Reaſon to charge it upon us: Which leads me to the next Thing, namely,</p>
            <p n="2">II. To ſhew wherein Miniſters ſhould take Care to give no <hi>Occaſion</hi> of Contempt. And their Care ſhould be expreſt in the following Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If they would not be deſpis'd, they ſhould ſee to it that they ben't <hi>ignorant.</hi> It was required under the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Oeconomy, that the <hi>Prieſt's Lips ſhould preſerve Knowledge,</hi> becauſe the People were to <hi>aſk the Law at his Mouth</hi> And the ſame Thing is equally neceſſary, under the Diſpenſation by JESUS CHRIST. Goſpel-Miniſters ſhould be as <hi>Scribes inſtructed unto the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>; they ſhould be like the <hi>good Houſholder, who can bring out of his Treaſure Things new and old.</hi> 'Tis mentioned by the <hi>inſpired Paul,</hi> as an <hi>eſſential Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of a Guide to Souls, that he be <hi>apt to teach,</hi> and <hi>able, by ſound Doctrine, both to exhort and convince the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005357_0013_101728F6B5AD45A0"/>
Gainſayers.</hi> And can the Miniſter be thus fitted for his Office, without conſiderable Degrees of Knowledge? He ought, certainly, to be a Man above the common Level for natural Capacities: Nor is this enough; but his Powers ought to be well cultivated by a good Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. He ought to have Skill in the learned Arts and Languages, ſo as to be ready to make uſe of them in the Service of the Sanctuary, as Occaſion may call for it: Nor otherwiſe will he riſe above juſt Contempt.</p>
            <p>It may reaſonably be expected of Miniſters, that they ſhould have made conſiderable Attainments, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in the Knowledge of <hi>Divinity.</hi> How elſe ſhould they be Teachers of others in this noble Art? Shall Men be ignorant in their own Profeſſion? How in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous is this? What can more ſtrongly tend to render them deſpicable? What will actually bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them greater Contempt?</p>
            <p>Not but that illiterate Men are ſometimes mightily cried up; raw ignorant Novices highly applauded and admired: But 'tis only among ſuch as have need to <hi>abound yet more and more in Knowledge and Judgment:</hi> As for others, who, by Reaſon of Uſe, have <hi>their Senſes exerciſed to diſcern both Good and Evil,</hi> they readily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Inſufficiency of Teachers, <hi>underſtanding nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what they ſay, nor whereof they affirm.</hi> Nor would it be ſtrange, if, in their Behaviour, they ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the low Opinion they entertain of them. And the Contempt due to ſuch <hi>blind Guides</hi> will, with Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, be reflected on others of the ſame Order, if they appear forward to invite them into their Pulpits; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, if they do it to the Neglect of thoſe who are of known eſtabliſhed Merit, and hereby baulk their own Judgment to fall in with the popular Humour.</p>
            <p>It may be worth Conſideration, We live in an Age, wherein there is ſome Learning as well as a great deal
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005357_0014_1017293FDCC7D7F8"/>
of Ignorance: And there are, among our Hearers, a conſiderable Number, eminent for their good Senſe and acquired Accompliſhments: And it muſt needs be diſtaſteful to ſuch, to behold thoſe ſet up for <hi>publick Teachers, who need themſelves to be taught which be the firſt Principles of the Oracles of GOD.</hi> They can't help conceiving a mean Thought of ſuch Medlers with what they are neither qualified for, nor called to; and their being careſſed, not only by the <hi>Populace,</hi> (which is no Wonder) but by thoſe cloathed with the <hi>ſacred Character,</hi> is a Damage to Miniſters in general. It makes their Credit run low; and in vain will they complain, if they are treated as a Set of Men knowing very little, though they pretend to know a great Deal.</p>
            <p>It will, doubtleſs, be here ſaid, the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the firſt Preachers of the Goſpel, were a Set of ordinary Men, deſtitute of the Advantage of Learning. And 'tis readily own'd, the moſt of them were ſo. But then 'tis obſervable, they were not allow'd to go forth from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to teach the Nations, <hi>'till they had been endued with Power from on High.</hi> i. e. 'till the HOLY GHOST had, in a miraculous Manner, fitted them for their Work. So that 'tis a Miſtake to think the Apoſtles commenc'd Preachers, while unfurniſh'd for the ſacred Employment. 'Tis true, they did not paſs thro' a Courſe of Study preparatory to their Miſſion as Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; but 'tis as true, that the Want of this was abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly made up, by the Effuſion of the HOLY GHOST upon them in miraculous Gifts; enabling them not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſpeak with Tongues, but without previous Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, and ſo as to be <hi>infallible Guides</hi> to Men, in the Way to Salvation.</p>
            <p>Some, perhaps, while they are meer Novices, may take upon them the Office of the Miniſtry, expecting the Beſtowment of the SPIRIT, in <hi>extraordinary</hi> Gifts; as in the Days of the Apoſtles. But they herein err,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005357_0015_101728F9A7FD6188"/>
not conſidering the Difference between the State of Things <hi>now,</hi> and when the Goſpel was <hi>firſt</hi> made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. It was neceſſary the Chriſtian Revelation ſhould be <hi>approved of GOD, by Signs, and Wonders, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, done in the midſt of the People</hi>; and that it ſhould alſo be infallibly delivered to the World, as the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rule of Men's Faith and Practice, which, it could not have been, if holy Men had not ſpoken, and wrote it, as mov'd and inſpired by the HOLY GHOST: Whereas, there is no Need of the like <hi>extraordinary</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the Divine SPIRIT, <hi>now</hi> that Chriſtianity has received its Confirmation and been eſtabliſht, in the World, as a Religion coming from GOD. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, the Way of becoming qualified to be Miniſters of this Religion is, not by any miraculous Interpoſition of Heaven, but by Attendance to Reading, Meditation and Prayer. In this Way, we may hope, thro' the Bleſſing of GOD, to be furniſht with all ſutable miniſterial Gifts: But if, inſtead of Labour and Pains, in the Uſe of <hi>ordinary</hi> Means, we expect the Deſcent of the HOLY GHOST in <hi>Tongues of Fire,</hi> or depend on <hi>extraordinary Revelations,</hi> or <hi>immediate Impreſſions,</hi> we ſhall only ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our ſelves meet Objects of Contempt. Who have all along been the ableſt Defenders of Chriſtianity? Who have ſet its Doctrines in the cleareſt and moſt conſiſtent Light? Who have explain'd and urg'd its Precepts, in the moſt inſtructive and convincing Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? Who have been the grand Supporters of its Worſhip and Order? Can this Honour be claimed by your Pretenders to <hi>immediate Revelations,</hi> and <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Influences</hi> from above? Muſt it not rather be given to thoſe, who, by hard Study, and a conſiderable Stay at the School of the Prophets, have, through a Divine Bleſſing on their Endeavours, got their Minds furniſht with deſirable Meaſures of Knowledge and good Underſtanding? There is no Room for Debate on the Matter. No Man, ſince the Days of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, was ever ſutably qualified for the Miniſtry, but in
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005357_0016_10172942CEB94980"/>
the Way of Labour and Pains, in an Attendance on the <hi>ordinary</hi> Means of Inſtruction: And thoſe who have left this Way of GOD's Appointing, in Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>extraordinary</hi> Supplies from the SPIRIT, have too commonly, ſooner or later, run wild, to the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, not only themſelves, but the whole Miniſtry, yea, Religion it ſelf, to Contempt.</p>
            <p>But poſſibly, it will be further urged, does not GOD ſometimes take Occaſion, from the Labours of Men of ſmall Parts, and little Learning, to ſerve the Ends of his own Kingdom? And if GOD approves of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of ſuch a Character, why ſhould not we? The Anſwer whereto is eaſy. A Diſtinction ought always to be made between GOD's Approbation of a Thing, and his taking Occaſion from it to do Good: Nor can the former be at all collected from the latter. 'Tis readily allow'd, the alwiſe merciful GOD may over-rule the Miniſtrations of weak ignorant Men for ſpiritual Advantage to Souls; but it cannot be argued from hence, that he looks upon ſuch Perſons as fit to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the ſacred Miniſtry. In Order to know his Mind in this Matter, the great Queſtion ought to be, what are the <hi>Qualifications</hi> the BIBLE, that public, ſtanding, authentic Revelation of the Divine Will, makes neceſſary to be found in thoſe who would be Goſpel-Miniſters? And if it appears, that it requires <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and <hi>conſiderable Degrees</hi> of it, thoſe only are fit to be put into <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e Miniſtry, who are thus qualified. There is, no Doubt, a Latitude in this Caſe. A Man may be qualified for the Miniſtry, tho' he ſhould not be furniſht with Knowledge in the higheſt Degrees: But then, he muſt have Knowledge in <hi>ſuch a Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as to anſwer the Scripture Demands,</hi> or he is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an unſutable Perſon to be employed as a Miniſter.</p>
            <p>And this is a Matter of greater Importance than many may be ready to imagine. For 'tis remarkable,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005357_0017_101728FE534A89A0"/>
when GOD would repreſent a People as in the moſt deplorable Circumſtances, 'tis in ſuch Language as that, Iſa. lvi. 10, 11. <hi>His Watchmen are blind: They are all ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant; they are dumb Dogs, they cannot bark. — They are Shepherds that cannot underſtand.</hi> On the contrary, when he is returning to a backſliding People, in a Way of Mercy, and would beſtow the richeſt Bleſſings on them, that is mentioned as one of the greateſt, Jer. iii. 15. <hi>I will give them Paſtors according to mine own Heart, which ſhall feed them with Knowledge and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</hi> And again, Chap, xxiii. 4. <hi>I will ſet up Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds over them, which ſhall feed them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Miniſters, if they would not be deſpiſed, muſt not ſet a <hi>bad Example.</hi> The Deſign of their Office is to diſengage Men from their Vices, and perſwade them to a ſober, righteous and godly Life, in Conformity to the Precepts of the Goſpel. And ſhall they, whoſe profeſſed Buſineſs it is, to turn Men from the Power of Sin and Satan, be the Servants of Unrighteouſneſs? How unſeemly is this? Thou that ſayeſt, a Man ſhould not commit this, or the other evil Deed, doſt thou do the ſame thy ſelf? Thou that magnifieſt the Law in thy preaching, doſt thou in thy Practice diſhonour GOD by breaking it? How ſhocking is ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct? And what but Contempt can be the Effect? 'Tis obſervable, when the <hi>Jewiſh Prieſts,</hi> in the Days of <hi>Malachi,</hi> departed from the Way of the LORD, and corrupted his Covenant, <hi>The LORD of Hoſts ſaid unto them, Therefore have I made you</hi> CONTEMPTIBLE, <hi>and</hi> BASE <hi>before all the People.</hi> And the like may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by all Miniſters, who behave after the ſame ill Manner. 'Twould be juſt in GOD to give them up to Contempt: Nor if they were baſe in the Eyes of the People, would it be beyond their Deſert. A vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Man, and yet a Preacher of Righteouſneſs, how groſs the Inconſiſtency! A Man of GOD, and yet vain, or proud, or covetous, or intemperate, or idle
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005357_0018_10172946038D7450"/>
and unfaithful, how palpable the Abſurdity! There is not, on the Earth, a more meet Object of Reproach. He has forfeited all Right to the good Opinion of Men; and ſhould he claim their Reverence, in Virtue of his Office, he would only render himſelf ſtill more contemptible.</p>
            <p>Nor may it be thought, that ſuch an one would be likely to do much good. Who would believe, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, what he ſaid? He would rather harden Men in Sin, than recover them from it. He would rather make them ſuſpicious of the Truth of Religion, than concerned to become the Subjects of it. There are, in one Word, no ſuch effectual Hinderers of the Goſpel, and Obſtacles in the Way of its Succeſs, as wicked Miniſters: And the greater the Contempt they meet with, the better.</p>
            <p>Only let it be remembred, thoſe only ought to be eſteemed <hi>wicked</hi> Miniſters, who <hi>viſibly</hi> appear to be ſo. If there is an agreeable Harmony between the Manner of their <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> they ought not to be loaded with bad Names, and treated with the Contempt due to abandoned Sinners. This, it may be feared, has been too common a Practice in theſe Times; but it's being a common Practice won't make it a Chriſtian one. We ought not to look into the <hi>Hearts</hi> of Miniſters inſtead of their <hi>Lives,</hi> and judge them to be <hi>Phariſaical</hi> and <hi>unconverted,</hi> from a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Knowledge of their inward Principles and Springs of Action. This is to aſſume to our ſelves the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of GOD, who only has an Inſpection into hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Hearts, and allows us to judge of one another only from what is <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>viſible. By their Fruits ſhall ye know them.</hi> This is the Rule out SAVIOUR has given us; and 'tis a Rule particularly refering to the Caſe of <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and the only one by which we may
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005357_0019_101728FFD97FC560"/>
form a Judgment of their Character. 'Tis true, they may not be the Men <hi>inwardly,</hi> they appear to be <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly</hi>; but this is none of our Buſineſs. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of Men's State, does not belong to us, but to JESUS CHRIST, who, when he comes in the Glory of his Father, will bring to Light the hidden Things of Darkneſs, and manifeſt the Counſels of all Hearts.</p>
            <p>I may add to what has been ſaid, Miniſters, if they would command Reſpect, muſt be <hi>Men of exemplary Holineſs.</hi> They muſt not think it enough, if they keep at a Diſtance from every Thing mean and baſe; if they abſtain from all groſs and notorious Crimes: But they ſhould expreſs a Care to ſhew out of a good Converſation their Works with Meekneſs of Wiſdom. It ſhould not content them, that they are blameleſs as the Stewards of GOD, not ſelf-willed, not ſoon angry, not given to Wine, not given to filthy Lucre; but they ſhould be Lovers of Hoſpitality, Lovers of good Men, ſober, juſt, holy, temperate: In all Things ſhewing themſelves Patterns of good Works, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the Believers, in Word, in Converſation, in Charity, in Spirit, in Faith, in Purity. This was the Direction PAUL gave TIMOTHY, as that which would not only ſet him above Contempt, but procure for him all ſutable Reſpect: Nor could he have advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to a more effectual Expedient to beautify his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and ſecure a good Reputation. There is a ſtrange Power in <hi>exemplary Virtue</hi> to command Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. It will, beyond the fineſt Accompliſhments of Learning, or the greateſt Eloquence in Preaching, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Miniſter amiable in the Eyes of People; they can't but love and honour him; yea, even profane Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, if not given up to a reprobate Mind, will treat him with a decent Eſteem, while they behold his good Converſation in CHRIST. And this alſo will give a ſingular Energy to his Preaching. A <hi>bad Life</hi> will turn the Edge of the keeneſt Diſcourſes, delivered from
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:005357_0020_1017294A5B973798"/>
the Pulpit; but when the Miniſter exhibits, in his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, a Pattern of what he preaches, his Doctrine will be likely to ſtrike the Mind with a divine Force, and anſwer the ſaving Ends to which it is deſigned.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Miniſters, if they would not be deſpiſed, muſt not expoſe themſelves by an undue Performance of the <hi>public Offices</hi> of their Station. 'Tis juſtly expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they ſhould manage theſe with a becoming Dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for they profeſs to have Ability to do ſo. And if they are <hi>Blunderers</hi> wherein they pretend to be <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> how ſhould it be but that they ſhould ſink in the Eſteem of Mankind? 'Tis thus in all other Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Nor will the Sacredneſs of the miniſterial Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter prevent its being ſo here. Miniſters may want the Art of managing in the common Buſineſſes of Life, and not be thought the worſe of; becauſe they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to no Skill in Affairs of ſuch a Nature: But they do pretend to have Skill in managing the <hi>public Offices</hi> of Religion. Praying, and Preaching, and over-ſeeing the Affairs of GOD's Houſe, are the proper Duties of their Calling; and if they are really wanting in a Faculty decently to perform theſe Duties, their Character muſt run low in the Opinion of all ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Judges. But to be diſtinct here.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Miniſters ſhould take Care to manage their <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Prayers</hi> ſo as not to expoſe themſelves to Contempt. It is not indeed to be expected, they ſhould all be able, in the like eaſy, natural, flowing Language, to lead in the Addreſſes of a Congregation to the Divine Majeſty. Some, it has pleaſed GOD to furniſh with the Gift of Prayer, to an eminent Degree. They never ſhine brighter, than when they are called, and it may be on a ſudden, to repreſent ſome ſpecial Caſe before the Throne of Mercy. Their Mouths are fill'd with Arguments, and they can utter themſelves to the Raviſhment of the devout praying Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:005357_0021_10172902C880BE18"/>
But though all are not alike gifted; yet all, methinks, ſhould be able to go out of the common Road, as Occaſion may call for it, without rambling, or ſtammering, or running into Tautologies. If any are wanting in ſuch an Ability, it may be fear'd, whether they have taken that Pains, in the Uſe of Means, which is proper, in Order to their attaining the Gift of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Or, if it ſhould be the Caſe of ſome, that they are born down with Over-modeſty of Temper, or poſſeſs not the Faculty of conceiving quick enough for a ready Utterance, they might do better to pray by ſome well-compos'd Form, than to run the Hazard of falling into Contempt by diſguſtful Heſitations.</p>
            <p>Nor is it enough that Miniſters pray well as to <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi> They ſhould take Heed to the <hi>Manner</hi> alſo, that it be with Seriouſneſs, in Oppoſition to all Levity and Airineſs of Temper; with an apparent Awe and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of Spirit, and with ſuch an awakened Fervour and Devotion, as ſhall make it evident, they realiſe the Worth, eſpecially of thoſe ſpiritual and eternal Bleſſings, which they aſk at the Hands of the great and good GOD.</p>
            <p>I ſhall add here, they ſhould be particularly careful not to mingle their own Paſſions and Prejudices with their Prayers: Nor ſhould they oblige a whole Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to be of their Mind, in Matters of doubtful Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, or elſe come to an undeſired Pauſe in their Devotion. Miniſters, when praying in publick, are to be conſidered as the Mouth of the Congregation; and as ſuch, there is a manifeſt Impropriety in their going into the Uſe of ſuch Petitions, or Thankſgivings, as a great Part of the Congregation can't, in Faith, join with them in offering up to GOD. I the rather mention this, becauſe it may have been too much a Practice, among ſome Miniſters, more eſpecially in the late Times, to expreſs themſelves in Language,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:005357_0022_1017294BE22ED2F0"/>
they could not but know, if they allowed themſelves to think, a conſiderable Number of thoſe they were praying with could not give their hearty Amen to. What others may think I know not; but to me, it appears a Matter of no ſmall Importance, that there be an Agreement between thoſe who pray, reſpecting the Things they pray for. And our SAVIOUR himſelf ſeems to have taught as much, in that Declaration of his, Matth. xviii. 19. <hi>I ſay unto you, that if any two of you ſhall agree on Earth, as touching any Thing that they ſhall aſk, it ſhall be done for them of my Father which is in Heaven.</hi> And it is as ſutable an <hi>Aſſembly of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping Chriſtians</hi> ſhould be agreed, reſpecting what they aſk of GOD in Prayer, as that <hi>two private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> ſhould: Nor otherwiſe may they encourage a hope, that it ſhall be done for them according to what they deſire. And if this was more thoroughly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, it might put Miniſters upon greater Care, ſo to adapt their Prayers, as that all might harmoniſe in ſending them up to the Throne of Mercy.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Miniſters ſhould take care that their <hi>Preaching</hi> be ſuch as may give no Occaſion of Contempt. And here ſuffer me, with an honeſt Freedom and Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, to mention ſome of the many Things which call for the Care of Miniſters, if they would not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed.</p>
            <p>And to be ſure, they ſhould not in their Preaching <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the Province of others.</hi> Their Work does not lie at large, but is reſtrained within proper Bounds. They are Paſtors to particular Flocks: Theſe are their ſpecial Charge; they have taken the Overſight of them, and ſhould employ themſelves in feeding them with Knowledge and Underſtanding. Not that they are ſo confin'd, that they may not preach but to their own People. This they may do; but it ſhould always be within the <hi>Rules of Order.</hi> They ſhould not go into other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:005357_0023_101729049D4C6D60"/>
to keep up an unreaſonable Diſaffection in Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to their own Miniſters: Neither ſhould they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to preach there, truſting in themſelves that they are righteous, but harbouring in their Breaſts unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Suſpicions of their Brethren, as carnal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted.</p>
            <p>It may look like Zeal for CHRIST, and a vehement Deſire to do good to Souls, for Miniſters to go about from Pariſh to Pariſh, ſpending themſelves and being ſpent, through their abundant Labours: And they may be careſſed on this Account by many Perſons, as having more of the Spirit of CHRIST and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> than their Brethren. But whatever Charity may be diſpoſed to hope, GOD only knows the true Spring of ſuch a Conduct. It may, poſſibly, be Pride and Self-Conceit, or a vain Itch to be admired and applauded: And among all who aſcribe it to ſuch a Cauſe, (as there are many that will) they will be contemned. But be the Motive what it will, ever ſo Chriſtian, or Noble, the Practice, I believe, is bad; as tending, in the natural Courſe of Things, to introduce Confuſion and Diſorder: Nor has it ever yet fail'd of ſinking the Credit of the Miniſtry, in a leſs or greater Degree.</p>
            <p>But after all, if any are fond of going about from Place to Place, thinking they ſhall hereby have Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of doing GOD good Service; why won't they go where they will invade no Man's Right, nor occaſion Schiſms and Separations. Are there not thoſe, even in this Province, and among the Engliſh too, (to our Shame be it ſpoken) who are deſtitute of the Goſpel, in the Miniſtry of it? And are there not vaſt Numbers, in the neighbouring Governments of VIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GINIA and NORTH-CAROLINA (not to ſay any Thing of the Natives) who live almoſt in heatheniſh Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? And would it not diſcover as much Love to Souls, and as diſintereſted Zeal to ſerve the Redeemer's
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:005357_0024_1017294F1A17DEE0"/>
Kingdom, for Miniſters to travel up and down, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel to theſe People, as to go about from Place to Place, where the Goſpel is preached every Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-Day, and by Perſons call'd to the Work, qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for it, and fixed in it? <hi>There</hi> is Room for <hi>itinera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>: And the more abundant any are in it, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er will be their Glory: Nor will any one be diſpos'd to withhold from them the Praiſe that is their juſt Due.</p>
            <p>Miniſters alſo ſhould take Care, that their Preaching may ſavour of <hi>Pains</hi> and <hi>Induſtry.</hi> Not that they may'nt preach, if they han't had Time to labour a Diſcourſe. Neceſſary Avocations, or the Suddenneſs of a Call to ſpeak, may juſtify their going into the Pulpit, when their Preparations have been more haſty than they would have choſen: And, at ſuch Times, a tolerable Meaſure of Candour in Hearers would make the Allowances that may reaſonably be expected. But, <hi>ordinarily,</hi> their Sermons ſhould appear to be the Fruit of <hi>Labour</hi> and <hi>Study.</hi> The wiſe Man ſays, <hi>The Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſought to find out acceptable Words.</hi> He is ſpeaking of himſelf, who, though he excelled all Men in Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, yet did not turn People off with any Thing that came next to Hand; but took Pains to expreſs himſelf in agreeable Language. And he is herein to be imitated by all Preachers. Not that fine Turns of Wit, high rhetorical Flights, calculated chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to entertain the Fancy, need be any Part of their Care; but yet, they ſhould endeavour to cloath their Diſcourſes in a becoming Dreſs. Their Language ſhould be far from low and vulgar, yet eaſy and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral: Their Words fitly ſpoken, and ſuch as may be likely to pleaſe Men to their Edification. And they ſhould the rather be concern'd about this, as wiſely cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Words, according to what follows in the next Verſe, are as <hi>Goads and Nails faſtened by the Maſters of Aſſemblies.</hi> i. e. "There is the like Power in them to
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:005357_0025_101729090B8C3128"/>
excite and ſtir up the Minds of ſlothful Men to the Practice of Virtue, that there is in a <hi>Goad</hi> to prick the Ox forward: Nor do they only ſting and move the Mind for the preſent; but are apt to ſtick as faſt in the Memory as Nails do, when they are driven into a Board."</p>
            <p>Nor ought Miniſters to think it enough, if they are careful about the Language of their Sermons; but the <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Method</hi> alſo ſhould be the Effect of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation and Study. Their Buſineſs is, <hi>rightly to divide the Word of truth.</hi> 'Tis the <hi>Word of GOD,</hi> and not the <hi>Traditions</hi> or <hi>Commandments of Men</hi>; 'tis the <hi>Faith once delivered to the Saints,</hi> and not <hi>Lectures of meer Reaſon,</hi> they ſhould bring their People. The <hi>Matter</hi> of their Preaching ſhould be the pure Goſpel of CHRIST. And they ſhould <hi>rightly divide</hi> it. i.e. They ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it in due Order; giving its Truths their proper Place and diſtributing them to the proper Perſons. And this they ſhould do like Men of Skill; and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to it, ſhould apply themſelves to their Work with Care and Diligence. So <hi>Paul</hi> adviſed <hi>Timothy</hi>; call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon him to <hi>ſtudy,</hi> if he would <hi>approve himſelf to GOD a Workman that needed not to be aſhamed.</hi> And he elſewhere recommends to him <hi>Reading</hi> and <hi>Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that <hi>his profiting might appear to all Men.</hi> And if ſuch an <hi>extraordinary</hi> Perſon as <hi>Timothy</hi> was obliged to the Uſe of Pains and Study, much more is this a Duty in the <hi>ordinary</hi> Officers of the Church.</p>
            <p>Not that a Miniſter, if he has tolerable Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for his Work, need be at much Pains to make Sermons that will pleaſe ſome ſort of Hearers. But e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven theſe Hearers ought to be <hi>edified</hi> as well as pleas'd. And though through want of Judgment, they may'nt be able to diſtinguiſh between an <hi>extempore</hi> Diſcourſe, and one that has coſt the Preacher a great Deal of hard Study; yet the latter, if as it ought to be, will be much
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:005357_0026_101729522AA622F8"/>
better adapted to promote their ſpiritual Profit; and there is more Reaſon to expect a divine Bleſſing will accompany it to this End. Beſides, a proper Reſpect ought to be paid to all Hearers; to the <hi>ſtrong</hi> as well as the weak, to the <hi>knowing</hi> as well as the ignorant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And this there may be, where ſutable Care has been taken to prepare what is to be delivered in public; for it may be accommodated to the Capacity of thoſe who are <hi>illiterate,</hi> and yet ſo contrived as to fall in with the Reliſh of the more <hi>intelligent:</hi> Whereas, if it is crude and indigeſted, though it may not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik'd by the weak and injudicious, it will be deſpis'd by thoſe of better Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>It will, perhaps, be ſaid, thoſe Miniſters who take little or no Thought before-hand what they ſhall ſay, are the Men who depend on the SPIRIT of GOD; and the Help they obtain from him more than makes up for the Want of Preparation by Study. None, I would hope, will eſteem Preparation by Study an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the Want of a juſt Dependance on the SPIRIT; for ſo far is this from the Truth of the Caſe, that they who are moſt careful to make ſutable Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, take the Method in which they may moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably expect the divine Influences; and they are the moſt likely Perſons to be favoured with them: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, it may be fear'd, thoſe, who venture into the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit without Fore-thought, preſume upon the SPIRIT rather than truſt in him; and 'tis too often apparent, that they receive no great Help from him. For who more confus'd, many Times, in their Diſcourſes? Who more raſh and unguarded in their Expreſſions? Who more vain and arrogant in their Boaſtings? Who more wild in their Imaginations? And, in a Word, who deliver the Truths of the Goſpel with a greater Mixture of Miſtake and Error? And ſhall it be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that ſuch Preaching is the Effect of <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> Communications from the Spirit? 'Tis a groſs
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:005357_0027_1017290D5F9F8CF0"/>
Reflection on the bleſſed SPIRIT of GOD to ſuppoſe ſuch a Thing.</p>
            <p>It may take with ſome People to be told by Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, they knew not the Text they ſhould preach from, till they came into the Pulpit; and they may be ready to think the Men inſpir'd; eſpecially, if they are able to deliver themſelves with Freedom and Zeal. But People ought to know, there may be great Warmth and Volubility in Speech, without any extraordinary Help from the SPIRIT. And the plain Truth is, the SPIRIT of GOD does not aſſiſt Miniſters <hi>now,</hi> as in the <hi>firſt</hi> Days of the Goſpel. He did it <hi>then</hi> by <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Revelation</hi>; he does it <hi>now</hi> in a Way more <hi>humane,</hi> by his Bleſſing on their Studies. And while Miniſters, in this Way, depend on his Help, they may humbly hope to obtain it: Whereas they will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves, and impoſe on People, if they go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to excuſe their Neglects in the Uſe of <hi>ordinary</hi> Means, pretending to <hi>extraordinary</hi> Communications from above.</p>
            <p>Miniſters likewiſe ſhould preach as thoſe who are in <hi>earneſt.</hi> The Buſineſs they are engaged in is the moſt ſolemn that can be. They have to do with Souls, one of which is of more worth than the whole World: And 'tis their <hi>Salvation</hi> or <hi>Damnation</hi> they are to treat with them upon. And ſhall they be cold and lifeleſs in an Affair of ſuch infinite Importance? Matters of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life and Death ſhould not be ſpoken of, in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Diſcourſe, but with a becoming Sollicitude: Much more, when Miniſters beſpeak Men in the Name of GOD, upon the Concerns of Heaven and Hell, ſhould they do it with all Solemnity of Spirit. And if, when they are talking upon theſe aſtoniſhing Truths, they ſpeak as if they were aſleep, or had not upon their Minds a ſerious Senſe of their awful Weight and Reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, how can it be that they ſhould affect the Hearts of
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:005357_0028_10172956820E4E60"/>
their Hearers? They will rather be diſpoſed to ſlight both them and what they ſay? Tho', that they might not do this injuriouſly, they ſhould be very careful they don't run into Miſtakes, taking that for <hi>Dulneſs</hi> in ſome, and an <hi>awakened Fervour</hi> in others, which may be no certain Indication of either. The Tempers of Miniſters are very different, and ſo are their Organs of Speech; inſomuch, that if they had all the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern about ſpiritual and divine Things, they would not be alike in the Manner of its Diſcovery. And it ought to be particularly notic'd, <hi>meer Loudneſs of Voice</hi> is no Sign at all of a ſutable Frame of Mind. There may be the <hi>ſtill ſmall Voice,</hi> and the Heart, at the ſame Time, ſeriouſly and thorowly warm'd with a Senſe of eternal Things; as on the other Hand, there may be a <hi>noiſy boiſterous Fervency,</hi> that is only <hi>hiſtrionical</hi> and <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected:</hi> And it very ill becomes the Miniſter, and tends rather to harden Sinners than do them any ſpiritual Good. There is very little therefore to be collected meerly from the Voice of the Preacher. The <hi>Manner</hi> is more to be regarded: And if he really feels what he ſays, be his Voice great or ſmall, it will ordinarily be perceived by diſcerning Hearers. And he ſhould always endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſpeak, not as tho' it were a Taſk, and he cared not what he ſaid; but as having upon his Mind an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened Senſe of the Worth of Souls, and the Weight of everlaſting Concerns.</p>
            <p>Further, Miniſters, in their Preaching, ſhould apply to the <hi>Underſtandings</hi> of their Hearers, and not lay out all their Endeavours to work on their <hi>Paſſions.</hi> Not that 'tis improper to ſpeak to the <hi>Affections</hi>; for they have their Uſe in Religion, and it may ſerve a great many good Purpoſes to excite and warm them. But then, it ought to be remembred, the <hi>Underſtanding</hi> is the leading Power in Man, and ought, as ſuch, in the firſt Place, to be applied to. To be ſure, the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ought not to be neglected. Light and Heat
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:005357_0029_1017290EE664C028"/>
ſhould always go together, and keep Pace with each other: Nor unleſs there is a due Proportion of the former, will it turn to any good Account, if there be ever ſo much of the latter: Nay, Heat in the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, without Light in the Mind, will ſerve rather to make Men wild, than religious; as has been too often verified by ſad Experience. Whenever the Paſſions therefore are addreſt to, a good Foundation ought to be firſt laid in the Underſtanding: Or otherwiſe, the Diſcourſe ſhould be manag'd ſo as to inform the Mind, at the ſame Time it kindles the Affections. And now the Preaching is ſuted to work, in a regular Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, upon the Powers of humane Nature; and if the Effect is not the ſpiritual Edification of Hearers, they can reaſonably reflect the Blame no where but on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>A rambling incoherent Diſcourſe delivered in terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Language, and with great Vehemence of Voice and Action, will have, I am ſenſible, a more powerful Tendency to diſturb the Paſſions, eſpecially of ſome People. But where is the Advantage of throwing the Paſſions into a Tumult? Of what Service can it be to raiſe them to ſuch a Height, as that the due Exerciſe of the reaſonable Nature ſhall be obſtructed? 'Tis true, Men may, in this State, appear to be religious, and this to an extraordinary Degree; but their Nature all the while is inverted, thoſe Powers got to be uppermoſt which were made to be kept under Reſtraint: And while they continue in this Condition, under the Government of their <hi>Paſſions,</hi> inſtead of their <hi>Underſtandings,</hi> they are in extreme Hazard; for there is no Wildneſs, whether in Theory or Practice, but they are liable to be driven into it. The ſhort of the Matter is, as Men are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Creatures, they are to be preached to as ſuch. The Addreſs ſhould be made, not ſo much to their Paſſions as to their Underſtandings; at leaſt, all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Care ſhould be taken to enlighten the Mind, and
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:005357_0030_10172958098977A0"/>
convince the Judgment, as well as to move the Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And if inſtead of ſpeaking to the <hi>Minds</hi> of Men, Miniſters will lay out all their Pains to work upon their <hi>Paſſions,</hi> as though herein lay the whole Value of Religion, they will certainly expoſe themſelves to all, who have any tolerable Acquaintance with the Frame of humane Nature.</p>
            <p>Moreover, Miniſters in their Preaching ſhould inſiſt upon the great and <hi>important Truths</hi> of Religion, and not beſtow their greateſt Pains upon leſs neceſſary Points; the <hi>Circumſtantials</hi> and <hi>Externals</hi> of Divine Worſhip: Much leſs ſhould they ſpend their Breath about needleſs Queſtions, which <hi>miniſter to Strife,</hi> rather than <hi>godly Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying.</hi> Theſe are not the Things which ſhould take up their Thoughts and Labours, unleſs they intend to bring themſelves into Contempt. If they would acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Honour, they muſt dwell upon thoſe Truths, which have a near and cloſe Connection with the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Men's Souls; ſuch as the undone State of Man by his Apoſtacy from God, and the Method of his Recovery, as reveal'd in the Goſpel. And as 'tis by JESUS CHRIST, and him alone, that a new and living Way has been open'd for the Entrance of Sinners into the holy Place, HE ſhould be the great Subject of all our Sermons. Their main Scope ſhould be, to unfold the Myſtery which was hid from Ages and Generations, but made manifeſt in theſe laſt Days, by the Incarnation of our JESUS, and the ſeveral Offices he has ſuſtained and executed, in our Nature, and in Order to effect our Salvation.</p>
            <p>I may obſerve here, the Scripture ever takes notice of three Things with Reference to the Affair of Man's Redemption. The firſt is the <hi>Grace</hi> of GOD <hi>purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> it. It's particular in its Care to fix our Thoughts on the Good-will and free Mercy of GOD, as the true, original, eternal Source of this Bleſſing. Next to the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:005357_0031_1017291204FD82F8"/>
Grace of GOD, it gives all due Honour to the <hi>Merits</hi> of the LORD JESUS CHRIST. 'Tis with a View to him, for his Sake, and on his Account, that the Sinner is ſpoken of as juſtified and ſaved. Theſe great Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Favours are granted to him, not for any Works of Righteouſneſs which he has done, but in Conſideration of the mediatorial Performances and Sufferings of the LORD JESUS CHRIST. This Righteouſneſs of the Redeemer is conſidered as the Ground and Reaſon, that on the Account of which he is intereſted in the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of GOD to eternal Life. But beſides the Grace of GOD, and the Merits of CHRIST, there is what the Scripture calls a <hi>Meetneſs</hi> for the Inheritance, a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paredneſs in the Frame of the Sinner's Heart for the heavenly Glory, wrought in him by the Power of the HOLY GHOST. And without this, 'tis as impoſſible he ſhould be happy as that Light ſhould have Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Darkneſs, or CHRIST with Belial. He muſt be chang'd from a Servant of Sin, to a Servant of Righteouſneſs; he muſt be made to put off the old Man, and to put on the new Man, or he cannot inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the Kingdom of GOD.</p>
            <p>And now, theſe are the Things which ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the Sum of our Preaching; and the rather, becauſe, in their proper Place, they are all neceſſary, and equally neceſſary, in order to Salvation. Had it not been for the infinite Compaſſions of the All-mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful GOD, he never would have purpoſed, or accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed our Redemption. Had it not been for the LORD JESUS CHRIST, what he did and ſuffered in our Nature and Stead, we ſhould have had no Title to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, no Righteouſneſs that would have been a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Ground for the Beſtowment of this Mercy. And if we are not transformed by the renewing of the HOLY GHOST; if we are not made holy in the internal Frame of our Minds, in Conformity to the Image and Will of GOD, neither the Grace of GOD, nor Merits of the
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:005357_0032_1017295B1857F2E8"/>
REDEEMER will be of any Avail to our Salvation: For while under the Dominion of Sin, and in Slavery to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Paſſions and corrupt Inclinations, we harbour Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in our Breaſts; and could we be ſuppoſed, in this Condition, to have a Right to Heaven, and to go there, we ſhould really carry the very Seeds of Hell along with us: Nor could we be happy, as reaſonable Creatures, even in that Place of Bleſſedneſs.</p>
            <p>Some, perhaps, may think it enough, if, in their Preaching, they magnify the Grace of GOD, and do honour to the Righteouſneſs of CHRIST; but 'tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary alſo that they explain to Men, and urge upon them, that Holineſs of Heart and Life, without which they cannot ſee the Lord; together with the <hi>Office</hi> and <hi>Influence</hi> of the HOLY SPIRIT in the Work of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. Theſe Things are all inſiſted on in the <hi>Bible,</hi> and ſeverally repreſented as having a neceſſary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with Salvation: And they ſhould, in like Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, be inſiſted on by Miniſters in their Preaching. There is no Inconſiſtency between the Truths, but a perfect and glorious Harmony. Men may, 'tis true, confound them in their Thoughts; they may place their own Holineſs in the Room of CHRIST, or the the Grace of GOD; making it ſerve a Purpoſe it was never intended to, nor is ſufficient for: And ſo, under the Notion of exalting the Grace of GOD, or the Righteouſneſs of the REDEEMER, they may entertain a Thought of inherent perſonal Holineſs, as a Thing almoſt inſignificant. But in either of theſe Caſes, they abuſe the Doctrine of the Goſpel, conceiving amiſs of theſe Truths. For they <hi>all</hi> have their Uſe in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair of Salvation; yea, in their proper Place, they are <hi>all</hi> neceſſary: Nor can there, be Salvation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them <hi>all.</hi> And People ſhould be told ſo by Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. 'Tis indeed the Buſineſs of their Office to ſet theſe Truths in a clear and diſtinct Light; and to this End ſhould their Preaching be mainly calculated.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:005357_0033_1017291575925330"/>Only, as there is Danger leſt proud Man ſhould aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe too little, in the Affair of Salvation, to the Grace of GOD, and depend upon his <hi>own Works</hi> inſtead of the <hi>Righteouſneſs by Faith,</hi> Miniſters ſhould be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in guarding againſt this Fault: Tho' they ſhould take Care, in the doing of it, that they don't run into the contrary Extreme; ſpeaking after ſuch a Manner of perſonal evangelical Holineſs, as to make it of very little Service: Whenas 'tis a Matter of ſuch Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that without it we are barr'd Entrance into the Kingdom of Heaven, both by the Appointment of God, and the Frame of our own Natures. And they ſhould the rather be conſtant in affirming, that they which have believed in GOD might he careful to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain good Works, becauſe 'tis too common a Thing for profeſt Chriſtians to be negligent of a good Life; yea, it would be well, if they were not ſometimes in a Temper of Mind to take Occaſion, even from the Grace of GOD, to continue in Sin.</p>
            <p>Moreover again, Miniſters ſhould be <hi>uniform</hi> in their Preaching; making it appear that they are Men of fixed and ſteady Principles. Not that they may not change their Minds, if they have unhappily fallen into Error, and juſt Grounds of Conviction are laid before them. It would be to their Honour, in this Caſe, to own their Miſtake; and no wiſe Man would think the worſe of them for it, but the better. But a Change of Sentiment, ariſing from a thorow deliberate Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is a Thing quite different from a fluctuating and inconſtant State of Mind: And if, from ſuch a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Diſpoſition, Miniſters are pepetually wavering in their Thoughts, to Day of this Mind, and to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of another, it will very much tend to weaken their Credit: Nor may they expect any Thing ſhort of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, if they <hi>temporiſe</hi> in their Sermons, ſpeaking one Thing to one People, and another Thing to another, on Purpoſe to ſute their Humours, and recommend
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:005357_0034_1017295D404E3770"/>
themſelves to the ſeveral Parties there may be among them. Such a <hi>Man pleaſing</hi> Conduct is beneath the <hi>Man,</hi> much more the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> moſt of all the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</hi> How much more becoming is it to deliver our Minds, at all Times, and before all People, as we may be call'd, with an open Frankneſs, an honeſt Freedom and Simplicity? It may, for the preſent, 'tis true, be of ſome Diſſervice to our Intereſt; but, in the End, it will bring us into Eſteem, and ſecure for us a laſting good Reputation: Whereas, if we ſhift and change, to gain the Applauſe of this, and the other Party, we ſhall not only act a mean and baſe Part, but take the ready Way to expoſe ourſelves to Contempt: And it ſeldom happens, but ſuch <hi>Servility</hi> meets with its juſt Deſert, ſooner or later.</p>
            <p>In fine, Miniſters ſhould not be wanting in a Care about the <hi>external Manner</hi> of their Preaching. This indeed is a Matter of the leaſt Importance; though, perhaps, moſt recommending to the Generality of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: For which Reaſon, it would not be miſpent La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, if Miniſters took ſome Pains that they might be Maſters of a <hi>good Pronunciation,</hi> and <hi>becoming Geſture</hi>: To be ſure, they ſhould avoid diſagreeable <hi>Tones</hi> and <hi>Whines</hi>; as alſo unnatural <hi>Diſtortions of Countenance,</hi> and <hi>Motions of the Body</hi>: Neither ſhould they turn <hi>Mimicks,</hi> endeavouring to <hi>ſpeak</hi> and <hi>act,</hi> not like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but thoſe they admire: They may herein Aim at being more agreeable, but they really make themſelves ridiculous. Above all, they ſhould take Heed of ſpeaking and acting as if they were beſide themſelves; for, in this Caſe, People will be apt to take them to be ſo, and treat them with the Contempt due to ſuch.</p>
            <p>Theſe now, and ſuch like are the Inſtances, in <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> which ſhould employ the Care of Miniſters, if they would not be deſpiſed. I go on, and ſay,</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:005357_0035_10172919D0CC1838"/>(3.) They ſhould be equally careful they don't expoſe themſelves by an undue Conduct, in Point of <hi>Church-Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi> Government is as neceſſary in <hi>Church</hi> as State; tho' the Ends to which it is deſigned, and the Manner of Adminiſtration may be different. And ſo far as it lies with Miniſters to preſerve <hi>Order</hi> in the Churches, they ſhould be religiouſly careful to do it; at all Times diſcountenancing ſuch a Behaviour, in the Houſe of GOD, a tends to Confuſion. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> has ſet a noble Example in this Kind. When there were, among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> thoſe who left their own Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and took upon them the Work that was proper to <hi>Miniſters,</hi> he exhorted and commanded them <hi>to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide every Man, in the ſame Calling wherein he was call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>; aſſuring them, that all were not <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> or <hi>Teachers.</hi> And when they ſpake many at once, in the Place of Worſhip, ſo as to endanger its being ſaid they were <hi>mad,</hi> he corrected this Abuſe; minding them that GOD was not the <hi>Author of Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but of Peace, as in all the Churches of the Saints</hi>; and directing, that <hi>all Things ſhould be done decently and in Order.</hi> The preſent Miniſters of CHRIST, 'tis true, may'nt pretend to determine in Matters of this Nature with the Authority of Apoſtles: Or if they ſhould, they would only expoſe themſelves to Contempt. But yet, they may adviſe and rebuke, and back their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and Reproofs, with ſuch Arguments from Scripture and Reaſon, as are ſuted to inform the Underſtanding, and convince the Judgment: Nor ſhould they ſuffer the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, in this, or any other Uſe of them, to lie by neglected, where Perſons break in upon the Rules of Decency, or otherways walk in a diſorderly Manner. They ſhould uſe them indeed with Prudence and Caution, and a becoming Tenderneſs and Compaſſion: but with a due Concern alſo for the Honor of CHRIST, and the Well-Being of the Church: And when theſe make it neceſſary, they ſhould, ſo far as it belongs to them, exerciſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:005357_0036_101729630688CA60"/>
               <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> and not be mov'd from their Duty here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, neither thro' daſtardly Fear, on the one Hand; nor a criminal Reſpect of Perſons, on the other. If <hi>Diſcipline</hi> is an Ordinance of JESUS CHRIST, it ought to be made Uſe of, in Obedience to him, upon all ſutable Occaſions: Nor may Miniſters expect any other than to be <hi>baſe</hi> in the Eſteem of People, if they ſneak &amp; cringe, and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute this Inſtitution of the Son of GOD to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, Paſſions, or Humors of Men. 'Tis <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> my <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Brethren,</hi> not the meer Name, but the vigorous and impartial Execution of the Thing, that muſt preſerve and eſtabliſh our Churches. Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers found the Advantage of it in their Day; and it would be of like Service in ours, wiſely and faithfully adminiſtred, both for the Credit of the Miniſtry, and the Edification of theſe Churches in Peace and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In the laſt Place, Fourthly, Miniſters ſhould take Care they don't hurt their Character, by an undue Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the <hi>more private Duties</hi> of their Calling. Their Duty is not confin'd to their <hi>public</hi> Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: They have a great Deal to do in <hi>private</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their People. They muſt viſit the ſick, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the Mourners, inſtruct the ignorant, warn the wicked, reduce the wandring, ſtrengthen the feeble-minded, bind up the broken-hearted; and, in ſhort, ſute their Counſels, and Warnings, and Conſolations, to the reſpective Caſes of thoſe they have to do with. And they ſhould be always in Readineſs to attend <hi>theſe Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of their Station; not ſpending ſo much of their Time about ſecular Employments, or in Studies foreign to their Office, as to take them off from the faithful Diſcharge of them: Neither ſhould they be partial in their Reſpects; but endeavour, by all Means, to do Good to <hi>all,</hi> preferring no one before another.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:005357_0037_1017291B56604198"/>In a Word, Miniſters will unavoidably have frequent Occaſions to converſe with their People: and they ſhould ever be careful to do it, after ſuch a Manner as not to be thought moroſe, haughty, or unſociable; yet ſhould they keep at a Diſtance from every Thing light, and vain, or mean. They ſhould be condeſcending, but not ſervile; they ſhould be pleaſant and affable, yet ſolid and grave; and though they ſhould not be backward to religious Diſcourſe, yet they ſhould take Care that it be brought in ſo as not to look forc'd and affected: And the whole of their Converſation ſhould be ſuch, as may have a Tendency to preſerve in the Minds of People, both a Love to them, and a Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them.</p>
            <p>And having thus, in a plain, though imperfect Manner, conſidered a few of the many Inſtances, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Care of Miniſters is neceſſary, if they would not expoſe themſelves to Contempt; I now go on,</p>
            <p n="3">III. In the laſt Place, to repreſent the Obligations which lie upon them to expreſs this Care. And theſe are ſolemn and weighty. The <hi>Honour</hi> of CHRIST calls for it; the <hi>Succeſs of their own Miniſtry</hi> depends very much upon it; Nor can they otherwiſe give a <hi>good Account of themſelves another Day</hi>: To which I might add the Regard they owe to the <hi>Credit of the Clergy in Common.</hi> Theſe are the Particulars the Time will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me but briefly to touch upon.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Honour</hi> of CHRIST is concerned in the Care of Miniſters not to be deſpiſed. They are his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, as they act in his Name, and by Authority de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from him. And ſhall they eſteem it a ſmall Thing, whether they are baſe, or honourable in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of Mankind? If they are deſpiſed, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt comes through their own Faulty Imprudences, will not the Diſgrace, however unjuſtly, be reflected on
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:005357_0038_101729648BEA4EE8"/>
him who ſent them? What greater Abuſes have been offered to the Name of CHRIST, than thoſe which have been occaſioned by the Follies and Vices of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters? And ſhall the Thought of being thus inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to our LORD and SAVIOUR ſit eaſy on our Minds? Shall we be unmindful of our Character, and take no Pains to act up to the Dignity of our Office, when our MASTER will ſuffer ſo much through our Neglect? Whoſe Honour ſhould we be tender of, if not his who has ſeparated us from our Brethren, and called us by his Grace to the Miniſtry of the Goſpel? The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the REDEEMER ſhould lay near our Heart: And yet, what more diſtant from it, while our Conduct is ſuch as tends to make us contemptible; for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt will finally, though injuriouſly, be turn'd upon CHRIST himſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Succeſs of our Miniſtry</hi> depends very much upon our not being held in Contempt. If People have a deſpicable Thought of us, of what Advantage will our Preaching be to them? They will conceive the ſame Opinion of our Sermons, as they do of our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; And ſhould we preach the pure Truths of GOD, and do it with the Eloquence of Angels, it would have little or no good Effect upon them. The <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> of old ſeem, in this, to have been well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with humane Nature. For when they would obſtruct the Miniſtry of our SAVIOUR, it was by baſe Attempts to leſſen his Reputation. <hi>Is not this,</hi> ſay they, <hi>the Carpenter's Son</hi>? And they wickedly miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented him to the People as one of a bad Character, a Profaner of the Sabbath, a Friend to Publicans and Sinners; and, in ſhort, a Perſon of no Religion himſelf, and that would keep them from having any too, if they minded what he ſaid; rightly judging, that, if they could but deſtroy his Credit, they ſhould, at the ſame Time, render his preaching inſignificant: And ſo it unhappily prov'd, in reſpect of Multitudes, in that Day.
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:005357_0039_1017291E8C65B8A8"/>
And the Effect will be the ſame <hi>now,</hi> and in all <hi>future Time</hi> to the End of the World. There is indeed no ſuch Thing as preaching ſo as to anſwer any good End, where Miniſters have loſt their Reputation, and inſtead of Reſpect are tho't of with Contempt by People. <q>We may obſerve (as One expreſſes it), when Men are prepoſſeſt in Favour of any one, every Thing almoſt which he ſpeaks, appears weighty and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant. Opinion gives Luſtre to, and begets a high Eſteem even of his Weakneſſes. When Opinion hath raiſed a Man up to a great Height, there muſt be ſomething ſublime and extraordinary in all his Performances. On the contrary, when a Man's Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit is ſunk and under Water, what little Regard is paid to what he ſays? He is under ſuch an unhappy Diſadvantage, that if he could ſpeak like an <hi>Oracle,</hi> it would hardly ſtick and make an Impreſſion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And what a powerful Argument is this to engage our Care that we don't expoſe our ſelves to Contempt? Are we content to live uſeleſs? Are we willing to go on in a Round of attending the Duties of our Calling, and do no good? Thus 'tis likely it will be, if we do not look to our ſelves, and take ſutable Care to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a good Character. It is this that muſt prepare Men's Minds for a favourable Reception of what we preach.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If we do not uſe did proper Meaſures to keep from Contempt, we ſhall not be able to give a <hi>good Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our ſelves another Day.</hi> Not but that it may be our Lot to be deſpiſed, notwithſtanding the moſt faithful Endeavours to deſerve the Eſteem of People: In which Caſe, the greater the Contempt we have paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through, if we have behav'd well under it, the brighter will be our Crown in the Day of CHRIST. But if we have brought Contempt on our ſelves, by our Follies and Vices, the Fault is our own. And if
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:005357_0040_101728DE26A520A0"/>
by thus rendring our ſelves deſpicable, we have not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hindered the Efficacy of our Miniſtry, but unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been the Occaſion of the Ruin of thoſe Souls, we might have ſaved; how dreadful will be the Account we muſt give up unto GOD! Should the People of our Charge accoſt us at the Bar of CHRIST; We were ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at your Imprudences; we were unhing'd, in our religious Sentiments, by your Unſteddineſs; we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came indifferent to the Practice of Piety, through your Want of Zeal in recommending it to us; we gradually loſt all ſerious Senſe of Divine Things, hardened our ſelves in Sin, and ſettled in Profaneſs and Infidelity, from the looſe, vain, evil Example you ſet before us: I ſay, ſhould our People thus beſpeak us, before the Tribunal of Judgment, how would it cut us to the Heart, and pierce our very Souls? Should they go on, and ſay; Had you behav'd ſo as to gain our Eſteeem and Reverence; had you preached, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed, and lived, ſo as to render Religion amiable in our Eyes; had you been faithful in your Warnings, ſkilful in your Counſels, and watched for our Souls as thoſe who were earneſtly deſirous of their everlaſting Salvation, it had not been with us, as it is at this Day. To you it is, in a great Meaſure owing; to your Negligence and Unſaithfulneſs; to your Want of Love to our Souls, and Care of their everlaſting Well-Being, that we are now plac'd at the left Hand of CHRIST, and muſt be doom'd to a Departure from him, into the Place of weeping, and wailing, and gnaſhing of Teeth. Would not ſuch a Charge as this make every Joint of us to tremble? Should not we be ſtruck with Horror to be thus challeng'd by the Souls committed to our Overſight, in the great and terrible Day of the LORD? There is no Guilt like that of the Blood of Souls. It crieth for Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance: And O who can conceive the Weight of Vengeance we muſt ſuffer, when Multitudes of loſt
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:005357_0041_1017292016F86AB8"/>
Souls ſhall riſe up, and call for it to be poured out upon us!</p>
            <p>But beſides the Souls of our <hi>own proper Charge,</hi> we ſhall, if we make our ſelves mean, be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for all the Damage that may herefrom ariſe to Religion in general; which will be greater than we can well imagine. Contempt will eaſily and naturally be derived from our <hi>Perſons</hi> to the Cauſe we are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging; inſomuch, that if we are <hi>baſe</hi> in the Opinion of the World, Religion will be ſo too. When <hi>Eli</hi>'s Sons, by their ſhameful Miſconduct in the <hi>Prieſt's Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> had <hi>made themſelves vile,</hi> the next Thing we hear of is, that <hi>Men abhorr'd the Offerings of the LORD.</hi> And the Effect will be the ſame now. If Miniſters behave ſo as to forfeit their Credit, it will make Way for the Prophanation of divine Ordinances, or a Neglect to attend on them; and from Careleſſneſs about the Things of Religion, Men will proceed to violate its ſacred Laws, and from one Degree of Wickedneſs they will go on to another, 'till they have made themſelves abandoned Sinners. And do we think the Blame of this no Ways belongs to us? It will <hi>all,</hi> if we have juſtly expos'd our ſelves to Contempt, be charged on us, to the aggravating our Condemnation, in the Day of reckoning. And better would it have been for us, if we had never been born. In vain ſhall we plead that we have propheſied in CHRIST's Name, that we have broken the Bread of Life, and poured forth the Wine of Salvation;—It will rather expoſe us to the more angry Reſentments of our Judge: Nor will any of the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> drink deeper of the Cup of the LORD's fiery Indignation. I may add, in the laſt Place,</p>
            <p n="4">4. We are bound to the Uſe of all proper Care not to fall into Contempt, becauſe of the <hi>Damage</hi> which may hereby accrue to the <hi>Miniſtry in Common.</hi> Were the Hurt confined to our ſelves, the Obligation would be
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:005357_0042_1017296A96E0A8B0"/>
the leſs; but it will probably ſpread from our <hi>Perſons</hi> to the <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> and <hi>all</hi> in general will ſuffer through our Miſmanagement. This, it muſt be owned, is very unfair. The Body of the Clergy ought not to be tho't the worſe of, becauſe ſome may make themſelves vile. But ſuch is the Temper of the World, that they will not reſtrain their Contempt to the <hi>particular</hi> Miniſters who may deſerve it, but will extend it to <hi>all</hi> of the ſame Order. And very ſevere have been the Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the <hi>whole Clergy,</hi> as occaſion'd by the ill Conduct of a few. It is too common, indeed, upon the Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of one, to hear it ſaid, they are all alike; and ſometimes the <hi>Office</hi> it ſelf muſt be aſperſed, and even the Wiſdom of GOD called in queſtion for eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. And ſhall not a Regard to the <hi>miniſterial Order</hi> make us careful of our Credit? We ſhould certainly take heed, we do not expoſe our ſelves to Contempt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if we do, it will not reſt on our own Perſons, but will more or leſs affect the <hi>whole Body of Miniſters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The APPLICATION remains. And</p>
            <p n="1">1. We learn from what has been ſaid, that the Work of Miniſters is <hi>very difficult.</hi> The Pains they muſt take to keep from being deſpiſed ſhows it to be ſo. How hard a Thing is it to attend the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Duties of our Office, ſo as to deſerve the Eſteem of People, and Preſerve in their Minds a becoming Reſpect for us? Unleſs we are Men of good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Abilities, and acquired Accompliſhments; at the ſame Time, maintaining a Care of good Works, it is impoſſible: And even in this Caſe, what Caution and Prudence, what active Zeal and Diligence, what Reſolution and Courage, are neceſſary? <hi>O who is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for theſe Things!</hi> If an <hi>Apoſtle</hi> of JESUS CHRIST cried out under the Weight of Care that lay upon him, how much more Reaſon have we to do it, who are not endowed with his <hi>Graces</hi> or <hi>Gifts</hi>? We can't be too
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:005357_0043_10172925E5419518"/>
ſenſible of the Need we ſtand in of divine Help: Nor can we too frequently repair to the Throne of Grace, that we may obtain Mercy, and find the Grace that may be ſufficient for us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What Reaſon have Miniſters to be <hi>humbled,</hi> that they have taken no more Care to preſerve themſelves from Contempt? Who of us can ſay, that our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct has been unexceptionable? That we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hav'd in our Office ſo as to give no Occaſion of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach? Dare we, any of us, the beſt of us, lay our Hands upon our Hearts, and juſtify our ſelves before GOD? We have all, at one Time or another, acted below our Character, in a leſs or greater Degree: And the more ſenſible we are of it, and humbled for it, the more worthy we ſhall be of Reſpect and Honor. And have we not, ſome of us, ſo expos'd our ſelves as that <hi>human Frailty,</hi> cannot be our Excuſe? Are we none of us, by criminally neglecting our Studies, leſs know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Things pertaining to the Kingdom of CHRIST, than we might and ought to have been? Have we none of us too often ventured into the Pulpit, when we have had nothing to ſay there, but what, through Want of previous Meditation and Care, has been crude and indigeſted, and ſitted rather to bring us into Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit with judicious Hearers, than to profit their Souls? Have we, none of us, been too careleſs of our Lives, behaving after ſuch a Manner as to prejudice People againſt Religion, rather than recommend it to their Love and Practice?</p>
            <p>I ſay not theſe Things to ſuggeſt Evil of the <hi>Body of the Miniſters of this Generation</hi>; for I really believe, and would take this Opportunity to declare it, that they are as pious, and faithful, and laborious a Set of Men, as any Part of the Chriſtian World is favoured with. I am indeed ſenſible they are too commonly deſpiſed at this Day, and to as great a Degree as was ever known in the
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:005357_0044_1017296EE9959970"/>
Country; but I truſt in GOD, the Contempt is injurious. Not that I think it is ſo, in Reſpect of them all: And 'tis, perhaps, principally owing to <hi>ſome of our own Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> that the Credit of the Miniſtry runs ſo low. Are there none among us, whoſe Conduct, in the late Day of Trial, has led People into a mean Thought of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in general? Did we all diſcover that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the World, and of the Frame of human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and act with that prudent Forecaſt, which might have been expected of Men of our Character? Did we all ſtand up for the <hi>Order of the Goſpel,</hi> and in <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence</hi> of its <hi>Truths</hi> and <hi>Ways,</hi> with the Courage and Faithfulneſs which became the Servants of JESUS CHRIST? Have we, none of us, too much connived at thoſe <hi>Errors in Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>Irregularities in Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,</hi> which have had a dreadful Tendency to ſink the Credit of the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> yea, and of <hi>Religion</hi> too, in the Land? Have we, none of us, invited into our Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits Men of mean Parts, and no Learning, at whoſe Performances we our ſelves have been aſhamed? Have we, none of us, taken Part with thoſe, who have treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the beſt Miniſters in the Country with Neglect, to ſay nothing worſe? Have we, none of us, had the <hi>Perſons</hi> of ſome particular Miniſters <hi>in Admiration,</hi> to the reflecting an unjuſt Odium on others? Have we not flattered them beyond all Bounds of Modeſty, and by our Flatteries ſtrengthened their Influence to hurt the Reputation, and together with it the Uſefulneſs of the <hi>Minſtry,</hi> GOD has ſet up in <hi>theſe Churches?</hi> And what is worſe than all this, have we, none of us, acted in the proper Charges of our Brethren, ſo as to leaven the Minds of their People with evil Surmiſings againſt them, though Men of as good Reputation for their miniſterian Gifts and Faithfulneſs, as our ſelves? Have we not ſpoken of them in a Manner ſo cenſorious and uncharitable, as to bring them into Diſeſteem, in their own Pariſhes? Have we not ſided with People in the Diſgrace they have heaped upon them? Have we not
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:005357_0045_101729707017B8C8"/>
encouraged them in their Alienations, Diſaffections and Separations? Or, if we have had too much Policy, or too little Courage, to be <hi>open</hi> in theſe Things, have we not by <hi>ſecret Whiſpers,</hi> and <hi>Cloſet-Inſinuations,</hi> done the Buſineſs as effectually? I charge nothing upon any in particular; but GOD knows, and we all know, that there has been great Guilt as to theſe Things: And ſo far as we are any of us, Sharers in it, we have Reaſon for deep Humiliation before GOD. A <hi>deſpiſed</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry will be a <hi>uſeleſs</hi> one. Wherein therefore we have had a Hand in bringing our Brethren into undeſerv'd Contempt, we have done great Diſſervice to the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the REDEEMER; nor could we, in any Thing, have more pleas'd the Enemy of all Righteouſneſs: For his Kingdom is never more likely to be in a flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing State, than when the Miniſtry of a Land is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriouſly held in Contempt. The good LORD humble and pardon us all, wherein we have been faulty! And may we be more upon our Guard in Time to come!</p>
            <p n="3">3. Miniſters ſhould do what they can to <hi>keep one another from being deſpiſed</hi>; not by countenancing one another in Wickedneſs; nor yet by ſtanding up for each other, in that which is a Diſhonour to Men of our Character. This would be to bring, both our ſelves, and the whole Miniſtry, into Diſgrace. But we ſhould be tenderly concerned for the Reputation of our <hi>Fellow-Labourers</hi> in the LORD, and ready, in all ſutable Ways, to advance it. We ſhould be diſpoſed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer our Brethren in Love, to hope well, and believe well, and ſpeak well of them, ſo far as there is Reaſon to do ſo. And if it is the Unhappineſs of any to be treated with Diſreſpect, not becauſe they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves worthleſs; or have acted a mean and baſe Part, but becauſe they have to do with ſuch as are unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably prejudiced againſt them, we ſhould both pity them, and uſe our beſt Endeavours, as we may have Opportunity, to wipe off the Dirt that is thrown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:005357_0046_10172928D9FF0780"/>
them. To be ſure, we ſhould not encourage <hi>Buſy-Bodies</hi> in coming to us with their idle tatling Stories; neither ſhould we ſtrengthen <hi>contentious</hi> Men in their Alienations and Diſaffections; much leſs ſtill may we allow our ſelves in <hi>ſecret Whiſpers</hi> to the Diſadvantage of our Brother, while we dare not tax him to the Face, with the Evil we inſinuate behind his Back.—Miniſters may do a great Deal to ſupport the Reputation of one another; and if they would heartily endeavour to do it, ſo far, I mean, as they might with Reaſon and Juſtice, we ſhould ſoon ſee the <hi>Clergy</hi> in better Repute than they enjoy at this Day.</p>
            <p n="4">4. How careful ſhould Miniſters be to <hi>introduce none into the ſacred Office</hi> who are like to be deſpiſed? We are the Perſons to whom it belongs, according to the Appointment of JESUS CHRIST, to ſeparate Men to the Work of the Miniſtry: And we ought to be cautious on whom we <hi>lay Hands</hi> for this Purpoſe. We ſhould not <hi>ſuddenly</hi> do it in an Affair of ſuch Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; nor indeed at all, till firſt ſatisfied, that the <hi>Qualifications</hi> of the Perſons are ſuch, as that there is no Proſpect of their falling into Contempt. And in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to this, there ſhould be ſome <hi>Trial</hi> of them before they are intruſted with the Care of Souls. It might be beſt, if we countenanced none in <hi>preaching</hi> 'till they had firſt been <hi>examin'd.</hi> I know it has been a long Cuſtom for <hi>young Men</hi> to go into the Pulpit, when they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves think fit to do ſo. Perhaps, the Churches in this Land are the only ones, who take ſo little Care in a Matter of ſuch Conſequence to the Intereſt of the Kingdom of CHRIST. 'Tis high Time it was rectifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And if, as a Means to ſo good an End, Miniſters would be peremptory in refuſing their Pulpits to <hi>all</hi> Candidates, 'till they had paſs'd their <hi>Trials</hi> before proper Judges, it might be of ſingular Service.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="unknown:005357_0047_101729736226FF08"/>To be ſure, all reaſonable Care ſhould be taken, that none be ſet apart for the Service of CHRIST, in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Miniſtry, but <hi>faithful Men</hi>; ſuch as are both <hi>apt,</hi> and <hi>able to teach</hi>; ſuch as are of <hi>good Behaviour,</hi> and have a <hi>good Report without.</hi> Raw, ignorant, unfurniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men, ought never to have committed to them the Adminiſtration of divine Ordinances. Says the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, 1 Tim. iii. 6. <hi>Not a NOVICE, leſt being lifted up with Pride, he fall into the Condemnation of the Devil.</hi> And if, in Oppoſition to his Advice, we are active in the Ordination of ſuch Perſons, or taking them into our Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, how can we excuſe ourſelves before GOD? Should they ſink into Contempt, as in all Probability they ſoon will, the Reproach would reach us; nor can it be but we ſhould be accountable for the Scandal hereby brought upon the Miniſtry.</p>
            <p n="5">5. We ſee, from what has been ſaid, the Reaſon we have to be thankful for the <hi>Means of Education</hi> among us. Not but that ſome, in theſe Days, have expreſſed a mean Opinion of <hi>Learning,</hi> and of the <hi>Colleges,</hi> where are the beſt Means for the Acquirement of it. It is a Pity any in <hi>holy Orders</hi> have been ſo unadviſed as to lead People into this Thought. They are herein very unlike to our pious <hi>Fore-Fathers,</hi> who had ſuch a Senſe of the Neceſſity of <hi>Learning</hi> as a Qualification for the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> that they ſoon founded a <hi>College</hi> in the midſt of a thouſand Straits and Difficulties; from whence, through the Smiles of Heaven, our Churches have, all along, been ſupplied with <hi>able</hi> Miniſters; Men who have been a Credit to the ſacred Function, and, I may ſay, an Honour to the Country. And ſhall this, and the other School of the Prophets more lately erected, be now ſlighted and neglected? We ought rather to rank them amongſt the richeſt Bleſſings, which call for our Thankfulneſs to Almighty GOD: Nor can we lay ourſelves out too much to ſtrengthen the Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:005357_0048_1017292A60E93390"/>
and Uſefulneſs; eſteeming them the beſt Security againſt an <hi>ignorant,</hi> and therefore a <hi>contemptible</hi> Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>And it were to be wiſhed, the young Men, in theſe Schools, would wiſely improve the Price put into their Hands to get Wiſdom and Underſtanding. And let me adviſe the <hi>Candidates of the Miniſtry,</hi> thoſe in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular who may be here preſent, not to ruſh too haſtily into the <hi>ſacred Employment,</hi> leſt they expoſe not only themſelves, but Religion alſo to Contempt. Give your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Reading, Meditation and Prayer; and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in theſe Things, 'till you have attained, under the Divine Influence, a ſutable Furniture, both of <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Graces,</hi> for the Service of the Sanctuary. And don't truſt your own Judgments in a Matter of ſo great Importance. And, if you ſhould be urg'd to enter upon Preaching, by thoſe who know not whether you are qualified for the Buſineſs, be not overcome to yield to their Entreaties; but wait 'till you are declared <hi>fit,</hi> by ſuch as are proper Judges in the Caſe. And don't be diſcouraged from Labour and Pains to get furniſh'd with conſiderable Meaſures of <hi>Learning,</hi> both <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Humane,</hi> becauſe, as the Times are, it may be of little Service to recommend you to the Eſteem of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny People. The State of Things, it is to be hop'd, won't always continue as at preſent: or however, you will find the Advantage of previous hard Study, thro' your whole Life; beſides that you will be hereby qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to be greater Bleſſings, in your Day, wherever the Providence of GOD ſhall fix your Place of Labour.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>People</hi> ſhould learn, from what has been ſaid, not to deſpiſe Miniſters, nor do any Thing that may tend to bring them into Diſcredit. I mean not, <hi>Brethren,</hi> to blame any of you for entertaining a mean Tho't of Miniſters, or expreſſing the low Opinion you have of them, when, by their Behaviour, they have forfeited a Right to your Regards. 'Tis fit and proper your Sentiments of, and
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:005357_0049_1017297524538B98"/>
Conduct towards us, ſhould be adjuſted to our <hi>viſible</hi> Character? And if we make our ſelves <hi>contemptible,</hi> we ought to be <hi>baſe</hi> in your Eſteem. But then, you ſhould take Care you don't deſpiſe us, when we give you no ſufficient Occaſion to treat us with Contempt. You ſhould not watch for our Halting, nor aggravate every Infirmity we may be betray'd into; but be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to make all reaſonable Allowances in our Favour, conſidering we are Men of like Paſſions with yourſelves, and liable not only to the ſame, but to more and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Difficulties and Temptations. Don't deſpiſe us for common Frailties, but rather cover them with the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Charity. Don't take up, and harbour in your Breaſts, unjuſt Prejudices, either againſt our <hi>Perſons,</hi> or the <hi>Office</hi> we ſuſtain: In ſuch a Caſe, ſhould we behave ever ſo circumſpectly, you would turn every Thing to our Diſadvantage: Nor would it be in our Power, ſhould we both <hi>preach</hi> and <hi>live</hi> like <hi>Angels,</hi> to make you think well of us. Take Heed eſpecially, that you do not deſpiſe us for thoſe Things, which ought rather to recommend us to your Veneration. If we reprove you for your Vices, don't be diſaffected to us; for this we muſt do, or we cannot be faithful to him who ſent us. If we ſee you expos'd to Danger, or turning out of the <hi>good old Way,</hi> don't take it amiſs if we are free in telling you of it; for we are moved hereto from the Love we bear to you. If we ſtand up in Defence of the <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> of the Goſpel, don't ſay we are <hi>carnal,</hi> and treat us as though we were your Enemies, and the Enemies of JESUS CHRIST; for 'tis in Obedience to him, and out of Compaſſion to your Souls, that we thus run the Hazard of your Diſpleaſure. In a Word, diveſt your Minds, as much as may be, of every wrong Biaſs, and candidly form your Sentiments of us, not from this or the other particular Action, not from our being of this or the other Party; but from what appears in our <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:005357_0050_1017297980A8CED8"/>
Conduct</hi>: And if this is ſuch as will allow you to think honourably of us, be in a Temper to do ſo; and do not carry it towards us with Neglect, much leſs Contempt, unleſs there is evident Reaſon given for it: And then, if we find Fault, we ſhall be unjuſt to you, and partial to ourſelves.</p>
            <p>And you ſhould not only take Care, that you do not deſpiſe us, but that you do not do any Thing that may tend to bring us into Diſcredit. If any of you ſhould not reliſh our Manner of preaching, as not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo well ſuted to your particular Turn of Mind, do not prejudice others againſt it, who may be both grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and profited by it. If any of you ſhould be ſo defective in your Charity as to ſuſpect, whether we are the Men <hi>inwardly</hi> we appear to be outwardly, do not leaven the Minds of others with the like evil Surmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; don't ſpeak of us as <hi>Wolves in Sheep's Cloathing</hi>; do not ſo much as <hi>whiſper</hi> a Thing ſo injurious to our Character. If any of you ſhould be fond of the Preaching of Men of ſmall Capacities and no Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, do not ſo inſiſt upon our taking them into our Pulpits, or ſeparating them to the Work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, as to force us to diſoblige you, or expoſe our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to thoſe who have more Knowledge and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>And here let me recommend to you one Thing, which, if duly conſidered, would be of great Service to the <hi>Credit</hi> of the Miniſtry; and that is, that you be well ſatisfied, not only of the <hi>good Diſpoſition</hi> of your Children, but their <hi>Promptneſs to learn,</hi> before you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote them to the Service of GOD, in the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of his SON. Don't think it will tend, either to <hi>their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,</hi> or the Benefit of the <hi>World,</hi> to give them an <hi>Education,</hi> with a View to the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> if their <hi>natural Abilities</hi> are of the <hi>lower Size.</hi> They may better <hi>ſerve their Maker, and Generation,</hi> in ſome other
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:005357_0051_1017297C6B6A2A90"/>
Employment. They may have a <hi>Genius</hi> for one or other of the various Buſineſſes of Life, though not a Turn of Mind fitted to make them ſhine as <hi>Miniſters:</hi> And 'tis Pity, their Uſefulneſs in the World ſhould be obſtructed, by a Miſtake in their Education which can't eaſily be afterwards mended. And if your Circumſtances in Life ſhould ſet you above your Neighbours, either in Point of Riches, or Honour, do not think it will be a Diſgrace to you, to devote your Sons to the Work of ſerving at GOD's <hi>Altar,</hi> if they appear to be peculiarly diſpos'd to it, and form'd for it. 'Tis true, they will not, in this Station of Life, be in the Way of <hi>worldly Preferments</hi>; but yet, what more noble Employment than that of <hi>Co-workers</hi> with CHRIST, in forming Men to a <hi>Meetneſs</hi> for the eternal Service and Enjoyment of GOD in Heaven? And if your Sons ſhould be <hi>Inſtruments</hi> in turning ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sinners to Righteouſneſs, would not this reflect an Honor, even upon you, both in this World, and that which is to come?</p>
            <p>Let me further ſay, as Miniſters, when low in the World, and hard put to it for a Livelihood, are too often deſpiſed, take Care you don't withhold from them more than is meet. And where 'tis the Lot of any to be fix'd among People, who, thro' Prejudices againſt the Goſpel, do little towards their Subſiſtence, ſuffer me to beſpeak for them your charitable Aſſiſtance; for thoſe eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, who, at the Deſire of this <hi>Convention,</hi> and as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by Promiſes of Help from them, have gone forth into ſuch difficult Service. One Deſign of our being now together is, to contribute to the Support of theſe <hi>Miſſionaries</hi>; and, I doubt not, you will join with us in this Act of Piety. We have had Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of your Goodneſs in former Collections, and truſt the preſent one will be enlarged through your Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. May we all, both <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> freely give as we have freely received; and to our Bounties
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:005357_0052_1017297F5AFE4740"/>
let us add our Prayers, that theſe Servants of the LORD may be carried through all their Difficulties, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in their Endeavours to do Good to Souls, to the Joy of their Hearts here, and the brightning their Crown of Glory hereafter.</p>
            <p>In fine, and above all, ſee to it, as you have any Value for our Credit, that our Miniſtry be not loſt upon you. If you reap no ſpiritual Profit by our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours for the Good of your Souls, but continue in your Sins, and grow worſe inſtead of better, nothing will have a more dreadful Tendency to bring us into Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace. The Language of your Impenitence will be, that we are a uſeleſs Set of Men: Nor will the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Religion fail of improving it to our Reproach. Whereas, if, under our Miniſtry, you are effectually taught to deal juſtly, and love Mercy, and walk hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly with GOD, this would put to Silence thoſe who might be diſpos'd to ſpeak Evil againſt us, and procure for us a Name better than precious Ointment. If, by Means of our Preaching, you are convinced of Sin, and turn'd from the Power of it; if your Tempers are rectified, and Manners reform'd; if you are really brought to love GOD and your Neighbour, and, in one Word, to poſſeſs and exerciſe that Faith and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and all thoſe Chriſtian Graces, wherein the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of GOD and the Power of Religion do truly conſiſt, we ſhall not need any other Recommendation; you will then be a living ſtanding Proof of our Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs: And we ſhould herefrom be under Advantage to do ſtill greater Service, to our own Comfort in this World, and our ſhining, in the next, as the Brightneſs of the Firmament, and as the Stars forever and ever.</p>
            <p>And now, may we all, both <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> receive what we have heard, ſo far as it is the Truth in <hi>Jeſus,</hi> in the Spirit of Love and Meekneſs. 'Tis probable, we ſhall never all of us be together again in
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:005357_0053_10172983B57C0FF8"/>
this Houſe. The Faces of ſome, who were preſent the laſt Year, we ſhall ſee no more, 'till we meet in the Day of the appearing of the SON of MAN. May we look to ourſelves, and ſo behave in our Stations, as that we may then be found at the right Hand of CHRIST, and have Admiſſion into that Kingdom, prepared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Foundations of the World, where we ſhall no more be in a Temper to deſpiſe, nor ſhall ever give Occaſion for Contempt; where we ſhall no more treat one another with Bitterneſs, Anger and Clamour, but live together in perfect Love and Peace; where, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of differing and contending with each other, we ſhall all be of one Mind and one Heart; joining with the innumerable Company of Angels and glorified Saints, in ſaying with a loud Voice, Bleſſing, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and Glory, and Power, be unto HIM THAT SITTETH ON THE THRONE, and unto the LAMB for ever and ever. Amen, and Amen.</p>
