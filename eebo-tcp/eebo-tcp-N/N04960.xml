            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday Auguſt</hi> 14. 1746.</p>
            <p>I Left <hi>Fort-Shirley</hi> in Company with Dr. <hi>Williams,</hi> and about fourteen of the Soldiers; we went to <hi>Pelham-Fort,</hi> and from thence to Capt. <hi>Rice</hi>'s, where we lodged that Night.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday</hi> 15. We went from thence to <hi>Fort-Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts,</hi> where I deſign'd to have tarried about a Month.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday</hi> 16. The Dr. with fourteen Men went off for <hi>Deerfield,</hi> and left in the Fort Serjeant <hi>John Hawks,</hi> with twenty Soldiers, about half of them ſick with the bloody Flux : Mr. <hi>Hawks</hi> ſent a Letter by the Dr. to the Captain, ſuppoſing that he was then at <hi>Deerfield,</hi> deſiring he would ſpeedily ſend up ſome Stores to the Fort, being very ſhort on it for Ammunition, &amp; having diſcovered ſome Signs of the Enemy; but the Letter did not get to the Captain ſeaſonably. This Day alſo two of our Men being out a few Miles diſtant from the Fort, diſcovered the Tracks of ſome of the Enemy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lord's-Day &amp; Monday</hi> 17, 18. We met with no Diſturbance, nor did we diſcover any Enemy; but the Sickneſs was very diſtreſſing, for tho' ſome began to amend, yet there were more taken ſick; eleven of our Men were ſick, and ſcarcely one of us in perfect Health,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:006211_0003_10280BB439C8D4D8"/>
almoſt every Man was troubled with the Griping and Flux.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tueſday</hi> 19. Between eight &amp; nine o'Clock in the Morning, when thro' the good Providence of God, we were all in the Fort, twenty two Men, three Women, and five Children, there appeared an Army of French and Indians, eight or nine Hundred in Number, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Monſieur <hi>Regand de Vaudrüle</hi>; who hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſurrounded the Fort on every Side, began with hideous Acclamations to ruſh forward upon the Fort, firing inceſſantly upon us on every Side. Mr. <hi>Hawks</hi> our Officer, ordered that we ſhould let them come without firing at all at them, until they ſhould approach within a ſuitable Diſtance, that we might have a good Proſpect of doing Execution. We ſuffered them to come up in a Body 'till they were within twenty Rods of us, and then we fired; upon which the Enemy ſoon betook themſelves to Trees, Stumps &amp; Logs; where they lay and fired inceſſantly upon us, ſome taking Opportunity to run from one Tree and Stump to another, and ſo drew nearer to the Fort: This they did in a very ſubtil Manner, running ſo crooked, that it was very difficult to ſhoot at them with any good Proſpect of Succeſs, until we obſerved that when they came to a Stump, they would fall down; which we obſerving, prepared to catch them there as they fell down by the Stumps; and this we did probably with Succeſs; for they ſoon left off this Method. About this Time we ſaw ſeveral of the Enemy fall and riſe no more, among which was the Captain of the <hi>St. Francois</hi> Indians, who was one of the foremaſt, and called upon the reſt to preſs on upon the Fort; Serj. <hi>Hawks</hi> got in Opportunity to ſhoot him into the Breaſt, which ended <hi>his</hi> Days.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:006211_0004_10280BF02EEFD2C8"/>At the Beginning of the Engagement, the General ſent his Enſign with his Standard (which he ſtanding behind a Tree about thirty Rods diſtant from the Fort diſplayed,) the General alſo walked up the Hill within about forty Rods of the Fort, where he ſtood, and gave his Orders, but being diſcovered he had a Shot or two fired at him; upon which he moved off, but preſently after comes to his Enſign, where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcovered, he received a Shot in his Arm, which made him retreat with his Enſign to their Camp. The Enemy ſtill continued to fire almoſt inceſſantly upon us, and many of them crept up within a dozen Rods of the Fort. We were ſtraitned for want of Shot; ſeveral of our Men being newly come into the Service, and for want of Bullet Moulds, had not prepared for any long Engagement; and therefore the Serjeant or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſome of our ſick Men to make Bullets, and another to run ſome Shot, having Shot-Moulds. This put him upon taking particular Notice of the Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, and he found it to be very ſhort, and therefore gave Orders that we ſhould not fire any more than we thought neceſſary to hold the Enemy back, unleſs when we had a very good Opportunity and fair Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of doing Execution; ſo that we fired but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. We had ſometimes very fair Shots, and had Succeſs; we ſaw ſeveral fall, who we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded never roſe again: We might have ſhot at the Enemy almoſt any Time in the Day, who were in open view of the Fort, within fifty or ſixty Rods of the ſame, and ſometimes within forty and leſs, the Officers ſometimes walking about Sword in Hand, viewing of us, and others walking back &amp; forth as they had Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, without Moleſtation, for we dare not ſpend our
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006211_0005_10280BB773077618"/>
Ammunition upon them that were at ſuch a Diſtance. Towards Evening the Enemy began to uſe their Axes and Hatchets; ſome were thoughtful that they were preparing Ladders in order to Storm the Fort in the Night; but afterward we found our Miſtake, for they were preparing Faggots in order to burn it. This Day they wounded two of our Men, <hi>viz. John Aldrich</hi> they ſhot thro' the Foot, and <hi>Jonathan Bridgman</hi> with a Fleſh Wound the back Side of his Hip. When the Evening came on, the Serjeant gave Orders that all the Tubs, Pails and Veſſels of every Sort, in every Room, ſhould be filled with Water, and went himſelf to ſee it done; he alſo looked to the Doors, that they were made as faſt as poſſible: He like wiſe cut a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage from one Room to another; that he might put the Fort into as good a Poſture of Defence as might be, in Caſe they ſhould attempt to Storm it. He diſtributed the Men alſo into the ſeveral Rooms: While he was thus preparing, he kept two Men in the Northweſt-Mount, and ſome in the great Houſe the Southeaſt Corner of the Fort, to Watch the Enemy and keep them back. I was in the Mount all the Evening, it was cloudy and very dark the Beginning of the Evening: The Enemy kept a conſtant Fire upon us, and as I thought, approached nearer and in greater Numbers than they had in the Day time. We had but little Encouragement to fire upon the Enemy, having nothing but the Light of their Fire to direct us, yet we dare not wholly omit it, leſt they ſhould be embolden'd to Storm the Fort: We fired Buck-Shot at them, and have Reaſon to hope we did ſome Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, for the Enemy complained of our ſhooting Buck-ſhot at that Time, which they could not have known had
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:006211_0006_10280BB5C52732D8"/>
they not felt ſome of them. They continued thus to fire upon us, until between eight &amp; nine at Night; and then the whole Army (as we ſuppoſe) ſurrounded the Fort, ſhouted, or rather yelled with the moſt hideous Out-cries all round the Fort; this they repeated <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> or four Times: We expected they would have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed this with a Storm; but were miſtaken, for they directly ſet their Watch all round the Fort; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their Watch, they ſent ſome to creep up as near to the Fort as they could, to obſerve whether any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons attempted to make their Eſcape, to carry Tidings to <hi>New-England.</hi> The Body of the Army then drew back to their Camps, ſome in the Swamp Weſt of the Fort, the other Part to the South-Eaſt by the River Side: We then conſidered what was beſt to be done, whether to ſend a Poſt down to <hi>Deerfield</hi> or not. We looked upon it very improbable, if not morally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for any Man to get off undiſcovered; and therefore the Serjeant would not lay his Commands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any to go, but he propoſed it to ſeveral, deſired and encouraged them, as far as he tho't convenient; but there was not a Man willing to venture out: So the Serjeant having placed the Men in every Part of the Fort, he ordered all the ſick &amp; feeble Men to get what Reſt they could, and not to regard the Enemies Acclamations, but to lie ſtill all Night, unleſs he ſhould call for them. Of thoſe that were in Health, ſome were ordered to keep the Watch, and ſome lay down, and endeavoured to get ſome Reſt, lying down in our Cloaths with our Arms by us; I lay down the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of the Night; we got little or no Reſt, the Enemy frequently raiſed us by their hideous Out-cries, as tho' they were about to attack us; the latter Part of the Night I kept the Watch.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:006211_0007_10280BB925B15A60"/>
               <hi>Wedneſday</hi> 20. As ſoon as it began to be Light the Enemy ſhouted and began to fire upon us for a few Minutes, and then ceaſed for a little Time. The Serj. ordered every Man to his Place, and ſent two Men up into the Watch-Box: The Enemy came into the Field of Corn to the South &amp; South-Eaſt of the Fort, and fought againſt that Side of the Fort harder than they did the Day before; but unto the Northweſt Side they did not approach ſo near as they had the firſt Day, yet they kept a continual Fire on that Side: A Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber went up alſo unto the Mountain North of the Fort, where they could ſhoot over the North-Side of the Fort into the middle of the Parade: A conſiderable Number of the Enemy alſo kept their Axes and Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chets continually at Work, preparing Faggots, and their ſtubbing Hows and Spades, &amp;c. in order to burn the Fort. About eleven o'Clock <hi>Thomas Knowlton,</hi> one of our Men, being in the Watch-Box, was ſhot thro' the Head, ſo that ſome of his Brains came out, yet Life remained in him for ſome Hours.</p>
            <p>About twelve o'Clock the Enemy deſir'd to Parley: We agreed to it, and when we came to General <hi>De Voudriúle,</hi> he promiſed us good Quarter if we would ſurrender; otherwiſe he ſhould endeavour to take us by Force: The Serjeant told him, he ſhould have an Anſwer within two Hours. We came into the Fort, and examined the State of it: The Whole of our Ammunition we did not judge to be above three or four Pounds of Powder, and not more Lead: And after Prayer unto God for Wiſdom &amp; Direction, we conſidered our Caſe, whether there was any Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of our being able to withſtand the Enemy or not; for we ſuppoſed that they would not leave us till they

had made a vigorous Attempt upon us; and if they did, we knew our Ammunition would be ſpent in a few Minutes Time, and then we ſhould be obliged to lay at their Mercy: Had we all been in Health, or had there been only thoſe eight of us that were in Health, I believe every Man would willingly have ſtood it out to the laſt; for my Part I ſhould; but we feared, that if we were taken by Violence, the Sick, the Wounded, and the Women, would moſt, if not all of them die by the Hands of the Salvages, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Officer concluded to Surrender on the beſt Terms he could get: Which were,

                  <item>II. <hi>That the Children ſhould all live with their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents during the Time of their Captivity.</hi>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides theſe Particulars, the General promiſed that all the Priſoners ſhould have all Chriſtian Care and Charity exerciſed towards them; that thoſe who were weak and unable to travel, ſhould be carried in their Journey, that we ſhould all be allowed to keep our Cloathing; and that we might leave a few Lines to inform our Friends what was become of us.</p>
            <p>About three of the Clock we admitted the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and a Number of his Officers into the Fort: Upon which he ſet up his Standard: The Gate was not opened to the reſt; the Gentlemen ſpake com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably to our People; and on our Petition that the dead Corpſe might not be abuſed, but buried; they ſaid, that it ſhould be buried: But the Indians ſeeing
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:006211_0009_10280BBC2EE5A168"/>
that they were ſhut out, ſoon fell to pulling out the Underpining of the Fort, and crept into it; opened the Gates; ſo that the Parade was quickly full: they ſhouted as ſoon as they ſaw the Blood of the dead Corpſe under the Watch-Box, but the French kept them down for ſome Time, &amp; did not ſuffer them to meddle with it: After ſome Time the Indians ſeem'd to be in a Ruffle; and preſently ruſhed up into the Watch-Box, bro't down the dead Corpſe, carried it out of the Fort, ſcalpt it, and cut off the Head and Arms: A young Frenchman took one of the Arms And flay'd it, roaſted the Fleſh, and offer'd ſome of it to <hi>Daniel Smeed,</hi> one of the Priſoners, to eat; but he refuſed it: The Frenchman dreſſed the Skin of the Arm (as we afterwards heard) and made a Tobacco Pouch of it. After they had plundered the Fort, they ſet it on Fire, and led us out to <hi>their</hi> Camp.</p>
            <p>We had been at the Camp but a little Time, when Monſ. <hi>Doty,</hi> the General's Interpreter, called me aſide, and deſired me to ſpeak to our Soldiers &amp; perſwade them to go with the Indians; for he ſaid, the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were deſirous that ſome of them ſhould go with them; and ſaid, that Serj. <hi>Hawks,</hi> myſelf, and the Families ſhould go with the French Officers. I anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer'd him, that it was contrary to our Agreement, and the General's Promiſe; and wou'd be to throw away the Lives of ſome of our Men, who were ſick and wounded: He ſaid, no, but the Indians would be kind to them; and tho' they were all Priſoners to the French yet he hoped ſome of them would be willing to go with the Indians. We ſpoke to Serj. <hi>Hawks,</hi> and he urged it upon him. We propoſed it to ſome of our Men who were in Health, whether
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:006211_0010_10280BF4C9129220"/>
they were willing to go or not, but they were utterly unwilling. I returned to <hi>Doty,</hi> and told him that we ſhould by Means conſent that any of our Men ſhould go with the Indians, we took the General to be a Man of Honour; and we hop'd to find him ſo; we knew that it was the Manner of the Indians to abuſe their Priſoners; and ſometimes to kill thoſe that failed in travelling, and carrying Packs, which we knew that ſome of our Men could not do; and we thought it but little better for the General to deliver them to the Indians, than it would be to abuſe them himſelf; and had I tho't that the General would have delivered any of our Men to the Salvages, I ſhould have ſtrenuouſly oppoſed the Surrender of the Fort, for I had rather have died in Fight, than to ſee any of our Men killed, while we had no Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to reſiſt. He ſaid, that the General would ſee, that they ſhould not be abuſed; and he did not like it that I was ſo jealous and afraid: I told him, I was not the Officer, but as he ſpake to me, ſo I had freely ſpoken my Mind, and diſcharged my Duty in it; and he had no Reaſon to be offended, and I hoped the General would not inſiſt on this Thing, but would make good his promiſe to all the Priſoners. He went to the General, and after a little Time, the Officers came and took away <hi>John Perry</hi> &amp; his Wife, and all the Soldiers, but Serj. <hi>Hawk, John Smeed</hi> and <hi>Moſes Scot</hi> and their Families, and diſtributed them among the Indians; ſome French Officers took the Care of the Families, viz. <hi>Smeed's</hi> and <hi>Scot's</hi>; and Monſ. <hi>Demuy</hi> took me with him, and <hi>M. St. Luc Lacorn</hi> took Serj. <hi>Hawks</hi> with him; and ſo we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that Night, having a ſtrong Guard ſet over us.</p>

               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:006211_0011_10280BC0C0846688"/>
               <hi>Thurſday</hi> 21. In the Morning I obtained Liberty to go to the Place of the Fort, and ſet up a Letter, which I did, with a Frenchman and ſome Indians in Company: I nailed the Letter up on the Well Poſt. This Morning I ſaw <hi>Joſiah Reed,</hi> who was very weak and feeble by Reaſon of his long &amp; tedious Sickneſs; I interceeded with the General for him, that he would not ſend him with the Indians, but could not prevail; I alſo interceeded with the General for <hi>John Aldrich,</hi> who being wounded in the Foot was notable to travel; but the Interpreter told me they muſt go with the Indians, but they ſhould not be hurt; and that they had Canoes a little down the River, in which the Weak and Feeble ſhould be carried: We then put up our Things, and ſet out on our March for <hi>Crown-Point,</hi> going down the River in <hi>Hooſuck</hi> Road: I was toward the Front, and within about half a Mile. I overtook <hi>John Perry</hi>'s Wife, I paſs'd by her, M. <hi>Demuy</hi> travelling a-pace; I ſpoke with her, and aſk'd her, how ſhe did? She told me, <hi>That her Strength failed her in travelling ſo ſaſt.</hi> I told her, <hi>God was able to ſtrengthen her; in Him ſhe muſt put her Truſt; and I hoped ſhe was ready for whatever God had to call her to.</hi> I had Opportunity to ſay no more. We went about four Miles to the Place where the Army en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped the Night before they came upon us: Here I overtook Neighbour <hi>Perry,</hi> which ſurprized me, for I tho't he had been behind me with the French, but he was with the Indians. I aſked him after his Health, he ſaid, <hi>That he was better than he had been.</hi> I inquired after his Wife, he ſaid, <hi>he did not know where ſhe was; but was ſomewhere with the Indians:</hi> Which ſurprized me very much, for I tho't till then
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:006211_0012_10280BFBC46EAC90"/>
ſhe was with the French. Here we ſat down for a conſiderable Time: my Heart was filled with Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, expecting that many of our weak and feeble People would fall by the mercileſs Hands of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy: And as I frequently heard the Salvages ſhout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; yelling, I trembled, concluding that they then murdered ſome of our People: And this was my only Comfort, that they could do nothing againſt us, but what God in his holy Providence permitted 'em; but was fill'd with Admiration when I ſaw all the Priſoners come up with us, and <hi>John Aldrich</hi> carry'd upon the Back of his Indian Maſter. We ſet out again, and had gone but a little Way before we came up with <hi>Joſiah Reed,</hi> who gave out: I expected they would have knock'd him on the Head &amp; kill'd him, but an Indian carried him on his Back. We made ſeveral Stops, and after we had travelled about eight Miles, we made a conſiderable Stay; where we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed our ſelves; and I had an Opportunity to ſpeak to ſeveral of the Priſoners, eſpecially <hi>John Smeed</hi> and his Wife, who being near her Time, was filled with Admiration at the Goodneſs of GOD in ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning her to travel ſo far. I ſaw <hi>John Perry</hi>'s Wife; ſhe complained that ſhe was almoſt ready to give out; ſhe complained alſo of the Indian that ſhe went with, that he threatned her. I talked with a French Officer; and he ſaid, that ſhe need not fear, for he would not be allowed to hurt her. Monſ. <hi>Demuy</hi> with a Number of Men ſet out before the Army, and ſo I took my Leave of her, fearing I ſhould never ſee her more. After this Serj <hi>Hawks</hi> went to the General, and repreſented her Caſe to him; ſo <hi>he</hi> went and talked to the Indian, and he was kind to her after
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006211_0013_10280BC41C936E00"/>
this. After we had travelled round the Fields, I tho't he was about to leave the River, which increaſed my Fears; but I found out the Reaſon, for they only went to look ſome Buildings to plunder &amp; burn 'em. A little before Sun-ſet we arrived at <hi>Vandeverickes</hi> Place, where we found ſome of the Army, who had arriv'd before us, but moſt of them were ſtill behind; and I had the Comfort to ſee the greateſt Part of the Priſoners come up; God having wonderfully ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned many who were Weak, the French carrying the Women: There were ſome few that tarried behind about two Miles; where Mrs. <hi>Smeed</hi> was taken in Travail; and ſome of the French made a Seat for her to ſit upon, and bro't her to the Camp; where about ten o'Clock ſhe was graciouſly delivered of a Daughter, and was remarkably well; the Child alſo was well; but this Night <hi>Joſiah Reed,</hi> being very ill, either died of his Illneſs, or elſe was kill'd by the Enemy; which, I never could certainly know, but I fear he was murdered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday</hi> 22. This Morning I baptized <hi>John Smeed</hi>'s Child, he called its Name <hi>Captivity.</hi> The French then made a Frame like a Bier, and laced a Buckſkin and Bearſkin upon it, and lay'd Mrs. <hi>Smeed</hi> with her Infant thereon; and ſo two Men at a Time carried them: They alſo carried <hi>Moſes Scot</hi>'s Wife &amp; two Children, &amp; another of <hi>Smeed</hi>'s Children; the Indians alſo carry'd in their Canoes Br. <hi>Simon</hi> &amp; <hi>John Aldrich,</hi> and <hi>Perry</hi>'s Wife down the River about ten Miles. We had remarkable Smiles of Providence; our Men that had been ſick, grew better, &amp; recover'd Strength; the Enemy killed ſome Cattle, which they found in the Meadows, ſo that we had plenty of freſh Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:006211_0014_1027DA448FCA1958"/>
and Broth, which was very beneficial to the Sick. I then expreſſed a Concern for the feeble People, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding that we were to leave the River, and travel thro' the Wilderneſs near ſixty Miles; but M. <hi>Demuy</hi> told me I need not fear, for the General had promiſed thoſe Indians a Reward who had the Care of the feeble Perſons, if they would be Kind &amp; carry them thro' the Journey. This Night I viſited moſt of the Priſoners: This Night alſo died two Indians of their Wounds. The Enemy had got four Horſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday</hi> 23. This Morning the General ſent off an Officer with ſome Men to carry News to <hi>Canada.</hi> This Day we left the River &amp; travelled in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs in ſomething of a Path, and good travelling for the Wilderneſs, ſomething Eaſt of North, about fifteen Miles, the French ſtill carrying <hi>Smeed</hi>'s and <hi>Scot</hi>'s Wives &amp; Children, the Indians finding Horſes for Br. <hi>Simon</hi> &amp; <hi>John Aldrich; Perry</hi> being releaſed from his Pack was allowed to help his Wife, &amp; carry her when ſhe was weary. About three in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, they were alarmed by diſcovering the Tracts of a Scout from <hi>Sarratogo</hi>; this put them into a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Ruffle, fearing that there might be an Army after them; but I preſumed that they need not be concerned about it; the Body of the Army lodged between two Ponds, but Part with a Number of the Priſoners were ſent forward about two Miles 'till they croſs'd <hi>Sarratago-River</hi>; it is there 20 Rods wide, but ſhallow Water. This Night died two more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians of their Wounds.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lord's-Day</hi> 24. This Day we ſet out in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and came to <hi>Sarratago-River,</hi> croſs'd it, and came to our Company, which had been before us;
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:006211_0015_10280BC8FB329E08"/>
here we came to a rich Piece of Meadow-Ground, and travelled in it about five Miles: We had good travelling this Day: We croſs'd ſeveral Pieces of good Meadow-Land: We went about eighteen Miles. <hi>John Perry</hi>'s Wife performed this Day's Journey without Help from any. Our ſick &amp; feeble Perſons were remarkably preſerved to Day; for about two o'Clock in the Afternoon there fell a very heavy Shower of Rain, which wet us thro' all our Cloaths. Mrs. <hi>Smeed</hi> was as wet as any of us, and it being the third Day after her Delivery, we were concerned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Event, but thro' the good Providence of GOD ſhe never perceived any Harm by it, nor did any other Perſon, but <hi>Miriam</hi> the Wife of <hi>Moſes Scot,</hi> who hereby catch'd a grievous Cold. This Night we lodg'd in a Meadow, where was a Run of Water, which makes a Part of <hi>Wood-Creek.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monday</hi> 25. This Morning we ſet out and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled about eleven Miles: We had ſomething rough travelling to Day; we quickly left the ſmall Stream we lodged by at our right Hand to the Eaſt of us, and travelling a few Miles over ſome ſmall Hills and Ledges, came to a Stream running from Eaſt to Weſt, about two or three Rods in Width, and about two Feet deep; we croſs'd it, our general Courſe being North; we travelled about two or three Miles farther, and came to a Stream running from South-Weſt to North-Eaſt, about ſix Rods in Width, which we croſs'd; and this Stream (which we ſuppoſe to be <hi>Wood-Creek</hi>) according to the beſt of my Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and according to the ſhort Minute that I made of this Day's travel) we left at our right Hand to the Eaſt of us; but Serjeant <hi>Hawks</hi> thinks I am
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:006211_0016_10280BFD49B6F428"/>
miſtaken, and that we croſs'd it again, and left it at the left Hand Weſt of us: I won't be certain, but I can't perſwade my ſelf that I am miſtaken. The French and Indians helping our feeble People, we all arrived well at our Camp, which was by a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Ponds; ſome few who were before us went to the drowned Land.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tueſday</hi> 26. This Day we took our Journey; our Courſe in the Morning ſomething Weſt of North; in travelling about three or four Miles we came to a Mountain a ſteep Aſcent about eighty or a hundred Rods, but not rocky; after we paſt this Mountain, our Courſe was about Weſt five or ſix Miles, 'till we came to the drowned Land: When we came to the Canoes, the Stream ran from North Eaſt to South Weſt; we embarked about two o'clock, the Stream quickly turned, and ran to the North; we ſailed about 18 or 20 Miles that Night, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped on the Eaſt Side of the Water.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wedneſday</hi> 23. We embarked about nine o'Clock and ſailed to <hi>Crown-Point,</hi> ſomething better than 20 Miles; ſome of the Army went in the Night before, and ſome before the Body of the Army. The Sails were pulled down, and the Canoes bro't up a-breaſt and paſſed by the Fort over to the North Eaſt Point ſaluting the Fort with three Volleys, as we paſs'd by it; the Fort returning the Salute by the diſcharge of the Cannon: This was about twelve o'Clock. Here we tarried 'till the 4th of <hi>September.</hi> I lodged in an Houſe on the North Eaſt Point. We all arriv'd better in Health, than when we were firſt taken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday</hi> 28. This Day I was invited by Monſieur <hi>Demuy</hi> to go over and ſee the Fort, which I did:
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:006211_0017_10280BCA85209B58"/>
It is ſomething an irregular Form, having five Sides to it, the Rampers twenty Feet thick, the Breaſt-Work two Feet &amp; half, the whole about twenty Feet high; there were 21 or 22 Guns upon the Wall, ſome four &amp; ſix Pounders, and there may be ſome as large as nine Pounders; the Citadel an Octagon built, three Stories high, fifty or 60 FeetDiameter, built with Stone laid in Lime, the Wall ſix or ſeven Feet thick, arched over the ſecond &amp; third Stories for Bomb-Proof; in the Chambers 9 or 10 Guns, ſome of 'em may be 9 Pounders, and I believe none leſs than ſix, &amp; near 20 Patararoes; but as my Time was ſhort, I can't be very particular: They have Stores of ſmall Arms, as Blunderbuſſes, Piſtols, &amp; Muſkets. This Night prov'd very cold and ſtormy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday</hi> 29. This Morning <hi>Smeed</hi>'s &amp; <hi>Scot</hi>'s Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies were bro't out of their Tents into the Houſe, that they might be the more comfortable: it rained, and was very cold all the Day, and at Night the Wind was very high.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday</hi> 30. Was ſomething warmer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lord's-Day</hi> 31. We had the Liberty of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping GOD together in a Room by our ſelves. This Day about 12 o'Clock the Enemy who went off from us from <hi>Hooſuck</hi> the Morning after we were taken, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned and brought in ſix ſcalps, viz. <hi>Samuel Allen, Eleazer Hawks,</hi> Jun. two <hi>Amſdell's,</hi> all of <hi>Deedfield, Adonijah Gillet</hi> of <hi>Colcheſter, Constant Bliſs</hi> of <hi>Hebron</hi>; and one Captive, viz <hi>Samuel Allen,</hi> Son to him who was kill'd; he was taken with his Father &amp; <hi>Eliazer Hawks</hi>; the <hi>Amſdells</hi> and <hi>Gillet</hi> were kill'd in <hi>Deer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field South-Meadow Auguſt</hi> 25; the Indians alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged they loſt one Man there.

told us they had not then heard in <hi>Deerfield</hi> of their taking <hi>Fort-Maſſachuſetts</hi>; a young <hi>Hatacook</hi> Indian was his Maſter, and carried him to <hi>St. Francois.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>Monday Sept.</hi> 1. <hi>Tueſday</hi> 2. <hi>Wedneſday</hi> 3. We tarried ſtill at <hi>Crown-Point.</hi> The Weather was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing lowry but warm: I lived with the General and about half a dozen more Officers, who lodg'd in the ſame Houſe; our Diet was very good, it being chiefly freſh Meat &amp; Broth, which was a great Benefit to me: We had alſo plenty of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> Wine, which being of an aſtringent Nature, was a great Kindneſs to me (having at that Time ſomething of the Grip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and bloody Flux) While we lay here, we wrote a Letter to the Hon. <hi>John Stoddard,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> at <hi>Northampton,</hi> to give him a particular Account of our Fight and Surrender; as alſo ſome other private Letters; the French Gentlemen giving us Encouragement that they would ſend them down by ſome of their Scouts, to ſome Part of our Frontiers, and leave them ſo that they ſhould be found; but I have not heard of them ſince, and conclude that they deſtroyed them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday</hi> 4. We embarked for <hi>Canada,</hi> about ten o'Clock, and ſailed about 15 Miles; our Courſe I judged to be North about ten Degrees Eaſt, which I take to be the general Courſe from <hi>Crown-Point</hi> to <hi>Champlain.</hi> Towards Night we turned into a Cove the Eaſt Side of the Lake, and encamped, having the Land upon the South Weſt South &amp; Eaſt of us: Here we were to wait for General <hi>De Vaudriüle,</hi> whom we left at <hi>Crown-Point,</hi> and expected would come to us this Night, or in the Morning; but the Night proved very ſtormy.</p>

               <hi>Saturday</hi> 6. About nine o'Clock this Morning the General came up with us; then we embark'd and ſailed with a pretty good Wind the bigger Part of the Day: Towards Night we ſaw a few Houſes on the Weſt Side of the Lake, but I ſuppoſe that they were deſerted. We ſailed at leaſt three ſcore Miles this Day; we came too where the Lake was but a few Miles in Width, and encamped on the Eaſt Shore, where there was a Wind-Mill &amp; a few Houſes, but were all deſerted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lords's-Day</hi> 7. We roſe early and ſet ſail as ſoon as it was fair Day-Light, having a good Wind, but the Wind fell about eight o'Clock, that they were obliged to ply their Paddles. When we came to the End of the Lake about eleven o'Clock, and were entring <hi>Champlain-River,</hi> we met a Boat with three Men in it, who brought a Packet of Letters for the Officers in the Army; they gave one or two to Monſ. <hi>Demuy</hi>: After reading the Letters he told me the News he had by them, <hi>viz.</hi> 'That there were a Number of Ships arriv'd from <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bec,</hi> who had brought them plenty of Stores; that they came in Company with a Fleet of 40 large Men of War from the <hi>Breſt</hi> &amp; <hi>Toulon</hi> Squadron, and gave the following Account; that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet having blocked up the <hi>Breſt</hi> Squadron in the Harbour, the Admiral of the <hi>Brest</hi> Squadron wrote to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals of the <hi>Toulon</hi> &amp; <hi>Rochfort</hi> Squadrons to come to his Aſſiſtance; who coming on the Back of the Engliſh Fleet, and the <hi>Breſt</hi> Squadron iſſuing out at the ſame Time againſt them, there enſued a terrible

Fight, in which the <hi>French</hi> prevailed, and ſunk one half of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships, and put the reſt to Flight, and then they ſailed for <hi>North-America</hi>; that the King ſent with them 12 Merchant Ships with Stores of Ammunition, Cloathing, Wine &amp; Brandy, and a thouſand Soldiers to ſtrengthen <hi>Canada</hi>; that the Men of War were divided into two Fleets, one of which did now block up <hi>Louiſbourg,</hi> &amp; were fighting againſt it; and the other Part of the Fleet was gone for <hi>Boſton:</hi> He ſaid that their King was very angry with <hi>New-England</hi> for their taking <hi>Cape-Breton</hi>; and it was probable he would bring them into Subjection: He told me alſo that they bro't News that <hi>Edward Stuart</hi> the Pretender's youngeſt Son was in the North of <hi>England,</hi> and had a powerful Army; &amp; that great Numbers of <hi>Engliſh</hi> reſorted to him daily, &amp; it was probable he would prevail to dethrone King <hi>George.</hi>' I told him that as for <hi>this</hi> and the <hi>Fight at Sea,</hi> I had good Reaſon to think they were falſe, for I had News from <hi>England</hi> ſince the <hi>Breſt</hi> Fleet had failed out, and there was no Account of theſe Things, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. He told me alſo that Prince <hi>William</hi> the Duke of <hi>Cumberland</hi> was kill'd in Battle at <hi>Culloden-Muir,</hi> and that he was the only Perſon of the Houſe of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nover</hi> which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation loved; ſo that altho' the King's Army got the Victory, yet it was a Loſs to his Intereſt, for the Duke being dead, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation would revolt from the Houſe of <hi>Hanover,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weary of it, and turn to the Houſe of <hi>Stuart's.</hi>' But I told him, that the <hi>Duke of Cumberland</hi> was yet alive, and as he had been a Scourge &amp; Terror to the King's Enemies, ſo we had Reaſon to hope he would ſtill be; he grew warm in his Debate, call'd the King

a Uſurper, the Nation in bringing of him in, <hi>Cromell's</hi> Faction; and many other Things: Upon which we had a conſiderable Debate, until he grew more mild, and began to flatter, and told me, what an amiable Man the <hi>Pretender</hi> was, and what good Times it would be if he came to the Throne of <hi>England,</hi> giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing free Liberty of Conſcience to all his Subjects, and he did not doubt but that they would return to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which was the true Church: Our Children, he believ'd would come to a good Union in Religion.</p>
            <p>We went on Shore at the firſt Houſe about three Miles above the Fort; where they were called toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſaid their Prayers; and as ſoon as they had done, Monſ. <hi>Demuy</hi> read his Letter; upon which, they all ſhouted, crying <hi>Vive le Roy:</hi> q. d. <hi>Let the King live.</hi> Upon which, ſeveral of the young Men came laughing to me, and by Signs endeavoured to inform me what the News was. I concluded that theſe fine Tales were framed and ſent to meet the Army, in order to keep up the Courage of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People and of the Indians, who ſeemed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of their engaging in the War, and to grow very weary of it: Tho' I found afterwards that the <hi>Brest</hi> Fleet was actually come over, with a Deſign againſt <hi>New-England.</hi> From thence we travelled down to <hi>Champlain</hi>; where the Gentlemen ſet up their Tents, and we had great Numbers to viſit us of both Sexes: There I expected we ſhould have tarried that Night, but a little before the Sun-ſetting M. <hi>Demuy</hi> came and ordered his Canoe's Company to embark, &amp; go down the River, and told me, I muſt go with them, and whatever I ſtood in Need of, his People would

give me: And indeed I wanted nothing, having good freſh Proviſions, and plenty of Wine to drink; but was ſomething ſurpriz'd at this ſudden Remove, and could never know the Reaſon of it, unleſs it was this, <hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Some of the French &amp; Indians going out from <hi>Crown-Point</hi> while I lay there, fell on a Number of our Men near <hi>Sarratago</hi>; had killed ſome &amp; taken ſome Priſoners, and were come to <hi>Champlain</hi> with one of them; and they wanted to get what News from him they could; and ſo choſe to get me out of the Way, &amp; ſome others, leſt we might give him a Caution; and he really wanted a Caution, for he told them that which he had better have kept to himſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> the miſerable Circumſtances of <hi>Sarra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tago</hi> Fort. We failed down the River about three Miles, and lodged at a poor Man's Houſe, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Ability, was courteous to me: I lodged with him in his own Bed; which was the firſt Bed I had lodged in ſince my Captivity; and tho' it was a hard Bed, and deſtitute of Linnen, yet it was very comfortable to me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monday</hi> 8. This Morning there came an Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to ſeeme, his Name <hi>Littlefield</hi>: He was taken a Lad from <hi>Piſcataqua,</hi> and ſo continued with the French, and lived, having a Family, at <hi>Champlain</hi>: We had conſiderable Diſcourſe together. About eight o'Clock we embarked; ſome Canoes paſſing down the River on the oppoſite Side. We ſailed over the River, and met with Monſ. <hi>Demuy,</hi> &amp; took him in: We ſailed down the River about 15 Miles, and dined with a Prieſt. The Country on <hi>Champlain-River</hi> appeared very poor, it being cold ſour Land; it is inhabited on each Side, but the Buildings are
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:006211_0023_10280BD44583F4F0"/>
generally but poor Hutts. This Day Monſ. <hi>Demuy</hi> tells me another Piece of News, <hi>viz.</hi> 'That one of their Men of War had taken an Engliſhman of War near <hi>Louiſbourg,</hi> after a whole Day's Engagement; that the Blood was Mid-Leg deep upon the Engliſhman's Deck when he ſurrendered.' I told him, they fought Courageouſly: He ſaid, true, but they were taken notwithſtanding: He ſaid, they had taken three Hundred &amp; twenty Men out of her, who were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to <hi>Quebec,</hi> where I ſhould meet them.' This was nothing but the <hi>Albany</hi> Sloop, one of the Men of War's Tenders, which Governour <hi>Knowles</hi> ſent with a Pacquet from <hi>Louiſbourg</hi> for <hi>Boſton</hi>: There were but ſeventy Men in her; ſhe was taken by a French Man of War near <hi>Jebucta.</hi> About two o' Clock it began to Rain, and continued a cold Rain all the reſt of the Day. We ſailed down the River between 30 and 40 Miles, and then carried over our Canoes &amp; Packs acroſs the Land to <hi>St. Lawrence,</hi> which was about three Miles, and we came to it above <hi>Lozel,</hi> and there we lodged that Night in a French Houſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tueſday</hi> 9. This Morning being ſomething lowry, we did not ſet out very early: The Wind was North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſterly and pretty high: About nine o'Clock we ſet Sail up the River for <hi>Mountreal</hi>; it was good ſailing; we dined at a French Gentleman's Houſe on the Eaſtern Shore: There was an Iriſh Doctor came and dined with us. his Name <hi>O Sullivan:</hi> He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended a great deal of Reſpect for me, &amp; Compaſſion towards all the Priſoners; a great deal of Friendſhip to the Engliſh Nation, and eſpecially for the Houſe of <hi>Hanover</hi>; and he inquired after the State of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and pretended to rejoyce that the <hi>Duke of

Cumberland</hi> had got ſuch a Victory over the Pretender and the Rebels; but I preſently found he grew weary in hearing the Particulars; and therefore to mortify him the more, I told him all that I could; then we ſet ſail, and went within about five Miles of <hi>Mount-Real</hi>; the Weather was ſomething tedious; and it rained in the Afternoon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wedneſday</hi> 10 This Morning it rained very hard 'till near ten o'Clock; about which Time the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and ſome others paſſed by us, and we embark'd directly upon it, and arrived at <hi>Mount Real,</hi> about twelve o'Clock. Monſ. <hi>Demuy,</hi> took me to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour's: He ſaid but little to me; he only told me, that for the Time I tarried at <hi>Mount-Real.</hi> I ſhould keep at Monſ. <hi>Demuy</hi>'s, but that after a few Days he muſt ſend me, with the reſt of the Priſoners, to <hi>Quebec.</hi> I went with Monſ. <hi>Demuy</hi> and was courteouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained by him for the Time I tarried at <hi>Mount-Real</hi>: In the Afternoon came an Engliſh Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to viſit me; ſhe was I judged between 60 and 70 Years of Age; ſhe was taken when a Child from <hi>Merrimack-River,</hi> her Name <hi>Hannah Rie</hi>; ſhe had been married to a Frenchman, by whom ſhe had four Children, three Sons &amp; one Daughter; her Daughter was married and had ſeveral Children, and came to ſee me; I ſaw alſo one of her Sons; ſhe had been a Widow about 14 Years, but was under very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Circumſtances. There was another Engliſh-Woman came to ſee me who was taken from the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but I have forgot both her Name, and Place where ſhe was taken from.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday</hi> 11. This Day I tarried at Monſ. <hi>Demuy's</hi>: Where the Major of the Town viſited me; he told
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:006211_0025_10280BD85BCE7820"/>
me that he married an Engliſh Woman whoſe Name was <hi>Storer,</hi> ſhe was taken when a Child by Indians, from <hi>Piſcataqua</hi>; that one of his Sons was down at the taking of us. Mrs. <hi>St. La Germine,</hi> one of his Wife's Couſins, who was alſo taken with her, came with the Major, and was able to diſcourſe in the Engliſh Tongue; ſhe told me that the Reverend Mr. <hi>Storer</hi> of <hi>Watertown</hi> was her Brother, and that ſhe wanted to hear from her Friends; but I was not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with any of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday</hi> 12. This Day about two o'Clock in the Afternoon, we embarked in Boats, and ſet out for <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bec,</hi> and ſailed down the River about five Leagues: There were all that were taken with me but ſix Men who were yet with the Indians, and <hi>John Perry's</hi> Wife who was at the Three-Rivers; there were alſo four Dutch with us, who were taken near <hi>Sarratago.</hi> We lodged in a Houſe upon the North Weſt Side of <hi>St. Lawrence's River.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday</hi> 13. This Day we had a fair Wind, and ſail'd down the River twenty five Leagues, when we arrived at the Three-Rivers. We went into an Inn: The General &amp; ſome others of the Gentlemen which went down with us, preſently went out to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor's, leaving only their Soldiers to guard us. And after a little Time the Governor ſent for Serj. <hi>Hawks</hi> and me, to come &amp; Sup with him: accordingly we went, &amp; were courteouſly &amp; ſumptuouſly entertained by him; and while we ſat at Supper, the Gentlemen fell into Diſcourſe about the Wars, and about the Wounds they had received; the General's Wound was diſcourſ'd upon; and the Governor deſir'd Serj. <hi>Hawks</hi> to ſhew his Scars, which he did. The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:006211_0026_10280D7F57EC92A0"/>
then inform'd us of a Fight he had been in at Sea in former Wars, in which he received 15 Wounds, and he ſhew'd us ſeveral Scars: This I tho't was a very remarkable Thing, that he ſhould receive ſo many Wounds, and yet have his Life ſpar'd. This Night <hi>John Perry's</hi> Wife was alſo bro't to us, and added to our Number.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lord's-Day</hi> 14. We ſet ſail, but received little Help from the Wind; the Soldiers were obliged to row the greateſt Part of the Day; but at Night the Tide favouring of us, we ſail'd 'till 2 or 3 o'Clock in the Morning: We ſailed in the Day &amp; Night 23 Leagues; then we went on Shore the N-Weſt Side of the River, &amp; lodged at a Houſe in a ſmall Village.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monday</hi> 15. This Day we ſailed ſeven Leagues and came to <hi>Quebec</hi>; we were landed at the Eaſt Point of the Town, where <hi>St. Lawrence</hi> meets with <hi>Loretto,</hi> and were conducted up by a Number of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers thro' the lower Town, to the Governour-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral's, where I was taken into his private Room, and he deſired me to tell him what News we had in <hi>New-England</hi>; I told him of conſiderable News we had from <hi>Europe</hi> concerning the Duke of <hi>Cumberland</hi>'s Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory over the Rebels: He ſeem'd to have a great Mind to perſwade me that the <hi>Duke</hi> was kill'd; but I told him he was alive &amp; well: I told him of ſeveral other Pieces of News, but none very good for the French: He told me he had heard that we deſigned an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition againſt <hi>Canada</hi>: He aſked me what there was in it: I told him that I liv'd at a great Diſtance from <hi>Boſton,</hi> and could ſay but little about it; I had heard that his Majeſty had ſent over to ſome of the Governors in <hi>America,</hi> that he had Tho'ts of an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition

againſt <hi>Canada,</hi> and would have them in Readineſs to aſſiſt him in Caſe he ſhould ſend a Fleet over: He inquired what it was that had put it by, ſomething he ſaid was the Matter: I told him, I could not tell; ſo he ſeemed to be pretty eaſy. After this I was conducted to the Lord Intendant's, who inquired alſo after News both of me and Serj. <hi>Hawks</hi>; after which he gave us a Glaſs of Wine: Then we were conducted to the Priſoners Houſe, which is a Guard-Houſe ſtanding by a Battery to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the South-Weſt-End of the Town about 150 Feet in Length and twenty in Width, and two Story high; and we made to the Number of 105 Priſoners. Here we had the free Liberty of the Exerciſe of our Religion together, which was Matter of Comfort to us in our Affliction: Serj. <hi>Hawks</hi> and my ſelf were put into the Captain's Room, where we found three Engliſh Maſters of Veſſels, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Wm. Chapman</hi> of <hi>Maryland,</hi> Mr. <hi>James Southerland</hi> of <hi>Cape-Cod,</hi> and Capt. <hi>William Pote</hi> of <hi>Caſco-Bay,</hi> who had all been Priſoners near ſixteen Months.</p>

This Day there came ſome Gentlemen to ſee me, among whom was Mr. <hi>Joſeph Portois,</hi> who underſtands the Engliſh Tongue; and Mr. <hi>Pais,</hi> who Mr. <hi>Portois</hi> told me was his Kinſman, and that he was a Proteſtant, &amp; came on Purpoſe to ſee me, and to ſhew me a Kindneſs: He gave me 24 Livres in Caſh. From this Time to the 23d there was nothing remarkable happened but only this, that the Jeſuits and ſome unknown Gentlemen, underſtanding I was ſhort on it for Cloathing, ſent me ſeveral Shirts, a good Winter Coat, ſome Caps, a pair of Stockings, and a few Handkerchiefs, which were very acceptable.</p>

            <p>Here I ſhall ſpeak of the Sickneſs that prevail'd among the Priſoners: It had generally been very healthy in the Priſon before this Fall; for tho' there had been ſome Priſoners there ſixteen Months, and about 50, nine Months, yet there had but two died; the firſt—</p>

            <p>But our People who were taken at Sea by the two French Men of War, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Larora,</hi> &amp; <hi>Le Caſtore,</hi> found a very mortal epidemical Fever raged among the French on board their Ships, of which many of them died: The Priſoners took the Infection, and the greateſt Part of them were ſick, while they lay
