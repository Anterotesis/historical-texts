            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <hi>THere were sundry other Sermons Preached from this Scripture, wherein the evil of the Sin of Pride was discovered; but they are not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with published, because</hi> lengthy Discourses <hi>are not easily Printed, nor do they finde that acceptance with those for whom this is intended, as little Tractates sometimes do. It must be confessed, that Pride is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity that deth abound every where, and in a peculiar manner in this great Town, where the Lord hath set me as a Watchman, and charged me to blow the Trumpet, that sinners may have warning of their danger; yea that I should (as many other of the Lords Messengers, with whom I think my self not worthy to be compared, are not wanting to do) cry aloud, and not spare to shew unto the house of Jacob their transgressions, and to his people their sins. That I might approve my self faithful (in some measure) to what the Lord requireth, the</hi> Discourses <hi>which have been delivered from this Text, were first Preached and (some of them) now Printed. My heart deceiveth me, if the main Motive prevailing with me to this publication, be not an earnest desire, which (I trust I may say) the Lord hath kindled in my heart, that the dishonour of the dear and blessed Name of God, and the eternal ruine of the Souls of men (the woful consequent of that iniquity, which is in the ensuing Sermons laid open) might be prevented. I have also considered, that I am not likely to trouble the world for any long time, and therefore have I been the

more desirous to do as</hi> Abel <hi>now doth, that is,</hi> being dead yet to speak, <hi>and to witness for God, and against Sin amongst men upon he earth, even then when my mouth shall be stopped with dust.</hi>

               <hi>Now the Lord, who alone can do it, bring his Truth home with power in the hearts of those it doth concern, which hath been and is the hearts desire of him, who ceaseth not to pray for the Conversion and Salvation of Souls, and remaineth</hi>

            <p>IN this Chapter we have the substance of one of the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sermon</hi> I.</note> Prophet <hi>Isaiah's</hi> Sermons, of which there are two parts; The first doth concern <hi>Israel,</hi> to the 4th Verse. The second hath reference to <hi>Judah,</hi> from thence to the end of the Chapter. The words before us fall under the first part of the Chapter, wherein we have</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Subject persons to whom the Prophet speaketh; <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> the ten Tribes of <hi>Israel,</hi> who are here called <hi>The Crown of Pride,</hi> that is, A proud Kingdome, and <hi>Ephraim:</hi> often so it is, that <hi>Ephraim</hi> is put for the whole Kingdome of <hi>Israel,</hi> partly because <hi>Ephraim</hi> was an honourable Tribe, descended from <hi>Joseph</hi> who was the best of all the Sons of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and partly because <hi>Ephraim</hi> was the first Royal Tribe in that Kingdome, <hi>Jeroboam</hi> who was the first King over the ten Tribes being an <hi>Ephraimite.</hi> Also the Subject that this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie lights upon, is said to be <hi>the head of the fat valleys over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with wine,</hi> by which the City of <hi>Samaria</hi> is meant, which was built upon a Mountain to the which there were fruitful Valleys belonging; thus described, <note n="(a)" place="margin">

            <p n="2">2. We have the Judgement denounced by the Prophet against this Kingdome of <hi>Israel, Wo</hi> to them; <hi>i. e.</hi> woful misery shall surely come upon them: <hi>Wo</hi> to the Crown of Pride, <hi>Wo</hi> to the Drunkards, <hi>Wo to Ephraim.</hi> And in the Verses following we have a more particular description of the <hi>Wo</hi> which is in this Verse generally threatned, the sum whereof is, A denunciation of speedy and utter ruine,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:000179_0005_0FA3153208190368"/>

The Doctrine therefore from the words is,</p>

               <p>Having discoursed at several times concerning the evil of that sin of Pride, we proceed now to speak concerning that of Drunkenness. And in the Doctrinal handling of this Point, we shall onely attend two things: 1. To enquire what that Drunkenness is that the Scripture denounceth <hi>Wo</hi> against? 2. How it doth appear that Drunkenness is a woful evil?</p>
               <p>
                  <abbr>Quest.</abbr> 1. <hi>What is that Drunkenness against which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture denounceth</hi> Wo?</p>

                  <hi>O</hi> thou <hi>that art drunken, but not with Wine.</hi> The Jews were in such a case, as drunken men are wont to be in, by reason of the Wine of Divine Judgment that was given to them. And one may be drunken with Errour and Spiritual Delusion; therefore is it said concerning Mystical <hi>Babylon,</hi> that is <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication,</hi> 
                  <bibl>Rev. 17. 2.</bibl> Antichristian corrupt Doctrines do as it were intoxicate and inebriate the Souls of them that do imbibe or imbrace them: they become drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard-like, even vertiginous thereby. Also one may be drunk with Security, <bibl>
                     <hi>Isa.</hi> 29.9,10.</bibl> 
                  <hi>They are drunken but not with wine, they stagger but not with strong drink: for the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep.</hi> Delusion and Security had made them as it were dead drunk. Some think that that is the Drunkenness which the Text Speaketh of; for Pride and Security are wont to go together, the one being the Cause of the other. <hi>Wo to the Drunkard's,</hi> that is (say some) to those that are secure in their sins, and <hi>setled upon

their lees</hi> in an evil course. No doubt but that this is implied, and partly intended here, but that is not the onely nor the principal evil here aimed at. Therefore <hi>2. Drunkenness</hi> is taken in a <hi>Literal,</hi> proper sense: There is Corporal as well as Spiritual Drunkenness, even a Drunkenness which not so much the Soul as the Body is the Subject of; and that is it which the Prophet here denounceth Judgement for: therefore in the latter end of this Verse he speaketh of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>overcome with wine.</hi> The Valleys near <hi>Samaria</hi> abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with fruitful Vines, <note n="*" place="margin">

Drunkenness was one of the works of the Devil which Christ came to destroy. It hath also another Cause, as bad or worse then the Devil, namely, Sin. It is a sin, and the cause of sin, (as afterwards will be shewed) and also the effect of sin. Therefore what a wofull evil is it? That corupt nature which is in sinners, canseth them to become guilty of this evil, <bibl>

The Drunkard will lose his Friends, and lose his Estate, and lose his Name, and lose Heaven, and lose his Soul for ever, and all for a little drink. Oh! what horrible madness is this! Drunkenness is a besotting sin, we say commonly, <hi>A drunken Sot;</hi> it turns men into meer Sots. Some that have been of excellent Parts, by means of excessive drinking have lost their Parts; and although they were before that of rare understandings, have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sotted so as that they have been beneath the ordinary sort of men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Drunkenness brings wo upon the Conscience.</hi> There are some sins which make deep and fearfull wounds in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and this is one of them; if the sinner have any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science in him, this will wound it. Indeed there are some that feel not these wounds for the present, because they have drunk Conscience into a deep sleep for a while, but when their Souls shall awake in the midst of Eternal flames, all the wounds received by this sin will be felt with a witness.

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Without Repentance this sin alone will ruine the Soul for ever.</hi> Now what a woful Evil is that which is the poison and bane of an Immortal Soul? Drunkards, think of this. If you knew that there were poison in your Cups, you would be loth to drink them off: did you see a Spider or other poisonfull Creature in the Pot, you would be loth to drink it down. I have read <note n="(i)" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Samuel wards</hi> Sermon on <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 32. <hi>Pag.</hi> 41.</note> of a Drunkard, that when he was drinking there hapned to be a Spider in the Pot, which he not observing, was poisoned, and died immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Believe it so it is, there is Soul-poison in your Cups, there are Spiders in your Pots, though you know it not: as sometimes they said to the Man of God, <hi>O there is death in the Pot;</hi> so I say to you that are Pot-Companions, <hi>O there is poison, there is Eternal Death in your Pots,</hi> drink, and your Souls will die. Now what a woful Evil is this, that hath slain Millions of Immortal Souls, one whereof is more worth then all the world? If a Soul be shut out of Heaven, then it is undone: but so shall the Soul of the Drunkard be for ever, without true Repentance. If I bring not Scripture to prove what I say, believe me not.

Now that was the subtilty of the Devil,

who knew that if he drew him into Drunkenness, he should be likely to prevail with him to commit the other abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions also: And so it came to pass, for when he was drunken, he went and defiled his Neighbours Wife, and after he had done that, he murthered her Husband, lest he should be revenged of him for that wicked fact.

There are some of you that have lived in this sin even to gray hairs; In the Name of the Lord I speak it to you, The Spirit of Jesus Christ is able to convert you, and the Blood of Jesus Christ is able to cleanse and sanctifie you; but you will be Miracles of Mercy, if it should be so: such Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are exceeding rare. <note n="(l)" place="margin">

                     <bibl>Mark 10.20,21.</bibl> which sheweth that <hi>Morality</hi> is a lovely thing, and well consistent with <hi>Christianity.</hi> Some among the Heathen have been notable <hi>Moralists,</hi> such as <hi>Cato, Seneca, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiaes, &amp;c.</hi> And although we must not say that their Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity saved them, yet it was not altogether unprofitable to them, for God did therefore reward them with many out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward blessings, and they did thereby escape many temporal Judgements, which otherwise would have befallen them: And they had more quietness in their own spirits, then otherwise would have been, being freed from those stinging Accusations of Conscience, which more profane sinners, that usually have an Hell in their Consciences, are daily tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with. Moreover, their punishment in another world will not be so great, as of those that have been of a vicious Conversation; for they shall <hi>chiefly be punished at the day of judgement, who have walked after the flesh,</hi> 
                     <bibl>2 Pet.2.10.</bibl>
                     <pb n="16" facs="unknown:000179_0019_0FA3153E438C5EF8"/>
and so have all Drunkards done. But then there is a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Sobriety,</hi> even that <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>Sobriety,</hi> which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture speaketh of, and which differs as much from that <hi>Moral Sobriety</hi> that some Heathens excelled in, as the Sun painted on the wall cometh short of the real Sun in the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament, the one being onely a common, the other a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial grace of the Spirit. Christian Sobriety doth proceed from such Principles, as no meer <hi>Moralist</hi> was ever acq<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uainted with, <hi>sc. From a Principle of Love</hi> to Christ, when a man out of sincere love to Christ, and desire to be like him, doth endeavour to walk even as he walked, that's Christianity, that's an Evidence of the grace of Sobriety. See <bibl>
                        <hi>Gal.5.22,23.</hi>
                     </bibl> 
                     <hi>The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance:</hi> so that amongst the fruits of the Spirit, <hi>Love</hi> is mentioned first, and <hi>Temperance,</hi> which implieth Sobriety, or that virtue which is contrary to Gluttony and Drunkenness, is last men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, as flowing from that Mother-grace of <hi>Love,</hi> which hath many Daughters, whereof <hi>Temperance</hi> or Sobriety is one. Also true Christian <hi>Sobriety</hi> is from <hi>Faith;</hi> hence <hi>Peter</hi> faith concerning the Gentiles, <hi>that their hearts were purified by faith,</hi> 
                     <bibl>Acts 15.9.</bibl> The Gentiles were much given to that defiling sin of <hi>Drunkenness,</hi> as the same Apostle else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where sheweth, <bibl>1 <hi>Pet.4.3.</hi>
                     </bibl> but by Faith they were taught to see the evil of that, as well as of other iniquities, and to live soberly as becometh the Gospel. So again Christian <hi>Sobriety</hi> is from that grace of <hi>Hope:</hi> A believer hath <hi>good hope through grace</hi> that he shall be with Christ for ever in Heaven; this hope hath that blessed effect upon his heart and life, as that it causeth him to abstain from all those Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices which are displeasing to the Lord, and to <hi>Purifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as he is pure.</hi> Here now is Christian Sobriety. All this may be intimated to us in that Scripture, <bibl>1 <hi>Thess 5.8.</hi>
                     </bibl> 
                     <hi>Let us who are of the day be sober, Putting on the breast-plate of faith and love, and for an helmet the hope of salvation.</hi> Now this Christian Sobriety is that which is especially necessary. So it is as to the <hi>necessity of the Precept:</hi> The Moral Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth <hi>Sobriety,</hi> and this Law is confirmed by the Gospel, <bibl>
                        <hi>Rom. 3. 31.</hi>
                     </bibl> 
                     <hi>Do we then make void the Law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the Law.</hi> The Gospel, which is
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:000179_0020_0FA3153EC4EB5E70"/>
the word of Faith, doth establish, though not the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, yet the Moral Law: wherefore it is said, that <hi>the grace of God,</hi> i.e. the Gospel, which is a very gracious Doctrine and Dispensation, <hi>which brings salvation, hath appeared to all men, teaching us, that denying a godliness and worldly lusts, we should live</hi> [Soberly] <hi>righteously, and godly in this present world,</hi> 
                     <bibl>Tit. 2.11,12.</bibl> Men under the Gospel are taught piety towards God, righteousness towards men, and Sobriety in respect of themselves. This Sobriety is also necessary, in order to attaining Eternal life, <bibl>1 <hi>Cor. 9.25,26,27.</hi>
                     </bibl> 
                     <hi>And every man that striveth for the mastery, is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible Crown, but we an incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible: I therefore so run, I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection, left that by any means, when I have preached to others, I my self should be a cast-away.</hi> The Apostle we see was very abstemious, even <hi>temperate</hi> in all things, left notwithstanding all his knowledge, and gifts, and service done for God, he should miss of Heaven at last. They that run a race must be very temperate; if they be not sober, they will never obtain the reward: So must they that are ingaged in a Christian course, that desire to run that Race of Christianity, live temperately, or else they will fall short of that Crown of Eternal life. Moreover, Sobriety is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, that so a man may be sit for Death and Judgement. When <hi>Paul reasoned before</hi> Felix <hi>of righteousness, temperance, and judgement to come, Felix trembled,</hi> 
                     <bibl>Acts 24. 25.</bibl> Well he might, for having lived intemperately, his Conscience must needs tell him, that it would be <hi>Wo</hi> with him at the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come. It is a vain thing for any one to hope for men, from Christ at the day of Judgement, that doth not live soberly now. Wherefore the Apostle faith, <hi>Be sober, and hope to the end, for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ,</hi> 
                     <bibl>1. Pet. 1. 13.</bibl> Then it is not hope, but presumption and vain confidence in the man that shall think Christ will be gracious to him in the day when he shall be revealed from Heaven, though Sobriety be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded by him: And therefore this grace is very beneficial as well as needful, for the Christian that hath and doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise the grace of Sobriety, is there by capacitated to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the temptations of Satan. Therefore is that, <bibl>1 <hi>Pet. 5.3.</hi>
                     </bibl>
                     <pb n="18" facs="unknown:000179_0021_0FA3153F83F6CD10"/>
                     <hi>Be sober, be vigilant, because your adversary the Devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about seeking whom he may devour.</hi> Men that are drunken, are not capable of desending themselves against their enemies, that watch to destroy them. Were not the <hi>Assyraians</hi> undone by this? <bibl>
                        <hi>Nah. 1.10.</hi>
                     </bibl> 
                     <hi>While they are drunken as drunkards, they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry.</hi> A few men may rout and ruine thousands of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies being over come with drink. Was not the huge Host of <hi>Benhaded,</hi> wherein there were above thirty Kings, even van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished by a few of the <hi>Israelites?</hi> And how came that to pass, but because <hi>Benhaded was drinking himself drunk, he and the thirty and two Kings that helped him,</hi> and thereby was incapacitated to make resistance against his enemies? <bibl>1 <hi>Kings 20.16.</hi>
                     </bibl> So it is, godly Sobriety, that doth render Christians fit to encounter with Spiritual Adversaries. And (not to enlarge further here) by means of this Sobriety I am speaking of, Christians are sitted to attend the duties of their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, not onely particular and Civil, but general and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly. Hence is that, <bibl>
                        <hi>1 Pet.4.7.</hi>
                     </bibl> 
                     <hi>Be ye sober, and watch unto prayer.</hi> Insobriety, Drunkenness unfits for Prayer, and for every other good work (as was shewed in the demonstration of the truth before us) even so where the grace of Sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is alwayes exercised, a Soul is fit to have to do with God in any duty, being alwayes prepared to have blessed Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him; then which, what can there be more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial or desirable?</p>

                     <hi>USE II. If Drunkenness be such a woful Evil, as hath been proved; Then they that have been kept from falling into this sin, and much more they in whom it is mortified have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant cause of Thankfulness unto God, because of his preventing and sanctifying grace in this respect vouchsafed.</hi> If we ought to pray (as Christ in that Platform of Prayer given to his Disciples hath taught us) that God would <hi>not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from evil,</hi> then when the Lord doth so, we ought to praise him: and if deliverance from out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward temptations be matter of praise and thanksgiving to the Lord, how much more is this true concerning delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from sinful temptations? for a man had better see many afflictions, then one sin; yea, there is more evil in the least sin, then in any affliction, nay then in all the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:000179_0022_0FA3154045D30B08"/>
burnings of the bottomless Pit. Therefore they that have been preserved from falling into sin, have the greatest cause of Thankfulness that may be. I doubt not but that there are many here this day, that were never guilty of this sin (at least-wise not in sight of men) in all their lives: But unto whom are you beholden for this preservation, but unto the preventing grace of God? Will you say that there is a Principle of inherent Grace within you, whereby you have been kept from this, and other the like enormities? Suppose so, yet that Principle of grace is from God: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will inherent, without upholding, preserving, prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace keep from this, or any other evil. Though it's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to live in this sin, where there is true grace; he that hath the least spark of true grace in his heart, it is not possible that he should live in this sin, yet there may be a falling into it: therefore Christ hath charged even his own Disciples to take heed of this sin, <bibl>
                        <hi>Luke</hi> 21.34.</bibl> which shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that a true Christian may possibly he overtaken with it. And we reade in Scripture of godly men that have been stained with this iniquity, as <hi>Noah, Lot, Uriah, &amp;c.</hi> yea, there is not a godly man on earth, but hath that in his own heart, which would soon lead him to the commission of this and all other abominations, if God should but leave him a little to himself: wherefore it was that the holy <note n="(n)" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi>
                     </note> Martyr, when he heard of any one that was guilty of Drunkenness, Uncleanness, or the vilest wickedness, would smite upon his breast, and say, <hi>In this heart of mine is that which would have made me commit the same evil. if the grace of God had not prevented.</hi> Oh therefore be humbly thankful to the God of all grace. But much more have they cause to be for ever thankful, who are mortified unto this sin: for a man may possibly never commit this evil outwardly, and yet the sin not mortified in him; it may be he may not have an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to practice this iniquity, or fear of punishment, or shame may deter him, and yet he is not mortified to it. This sin is mortified, when a man doth forsake and abhor it more then Death or Hell, because thereby God is offended and dishonoured; they that do so, shall not die—but live, <bibl>
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13.</bibl> 
                     <hi>If ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortifie the deeds of the body, ye shall live.</hi>
                     <pb n="20" facs="unknown:000179_0023_0FA3154104E7F370"/>
Drunkenness is one of the deeds of the body, and of the flesh; I do not say that he that doth not commit that sin shall live, but he that doth mortifie it shall live: for as he that repenteth truly of one sin, repents of all; so he that indeed is mortified to one sin, is so to all: such then shall live, and therefore have abundant cause of rejoycing and thankfulness before the Lord.</p>

This Text and Doctrine is like a Thunderbolt, enough to shake the Soul, and Split the Heart of every Drunkard under Heaven.</hi> I could be glad if there were no need to speak by way of Terrour and Awakening to such sinners.

                     <bibl>2 Chron. 28.9.10.</bibl> so I say, <hi>This sin is amongst us, even amongst us also,</hi> yea and the rage of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to reach up to Heaven, it crieth for Judgement. It is sad, that ever this Serpent should creep over into this Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, where threescore years ago he never had had any footing, but now it is come, and I fear will hardly ever out again, although it hath already devoured many. If we speak of that which God and Scripture call <hi>Drunkenness,</hi> namely, when there is a drinking of Wine or strong drink to any excess, how many are there that have cause to lay their hands upon their mouthes, and to cry <hi>Guilty,</hi> before the Lord? I have heard some say, that there is more Wine drunk in this Town, then in most Towns of the same greatness in the Christian world. We may then fear that there hath been much excess herein, that any should have cause so to speak or think. And how many are there that must be reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst woful Drunkards, that nevertheless do not believe any such thing of themselves? There are that flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in their iniquity, and think that they are hardly guilty of this sin, because they are not went to be subject to such, worse then beastly Drunkenness, as not to be able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what they do or say; when as it may be the reason of it is, because by using themselves to excessive drinking, they are

                        <hi>Isa.5.22.</hi>
                     </bibl> 
                     <hi>Wo unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink.</hi> Again, there are that will make others drunk: some have done this out of horrid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneness of spirit, and therefore its a delight to them, to draw those into this sin that make any Profession of Religion. If they can but make a Church-member drunk, then they are glad; which argueth a strange degree of impiety. Others have done this out of Coverousness: There hath been an horrible thing done in this respect; Some amongst us (who they are the Lord knoweth) out of Covetousness have sold Liquors and strong drink to these poor <hi>Indians,</hi> whose Land we possess, and have made them drunk therewith. What a fearful sin is that! The First-fathers in this Colony, who are now the most of them in heaven, began this Plantation, in part, out of respect to the Conversion and Salvation of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives amongst whom we live; but what woful degeneracy is this that some should rise up amongst us, that out of love to a little filthy lucre, shall teach them such wickedness as before they were never acquainted with. The <hi>Indians</hi> are of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the saddest spectacles of Misery, and the most woful remembrance of the ruines of the righteous and glorious Image of God, that ever mortal eye beheld; but therefore their sin is not a little aggravated, that shall make such poor creatures more the children of Hell then they were before. If there be any in the Congregation (as I doubt there is) whose Conscience doth accuse him of making others drunk, let him hear the word of the Lord which is written, <bibl>
                        <hi>Hab.2. 15. 16.</hi>
                     </bibl> 
                     <hi>Wo to him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy bottle to him, and makest him drunken also: The cup of the Lords right hand shall be turned unto thee.</hi> By these things then it is sadly evident, that there is cause enough to bear witness against this Evil.</p>

                     <pb n="22" facs="unknown:000179_0025_0FA315C2048CD738"/>Now to speak something further, and more particularly, by way of Conviction and Awakening to those that love and live in this sin of Drunkenness, know and believe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That woful Judgements have ever followed this sin.</hi> The Text faith it, and woful Experience proveth it. What hath been formerly said concerning the wofulness of the sin of <hi>Pride,</hi> may here be applied to this of Drunkenness. Personal Miseries come from hence upon the <hi>Estates, Names, Bodies, Souls</hi> of guilty ones, as was more fully shewed the last <hi>Sermon.</hi> And this sin brings Family-judgements; Thousands of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies that have been brought to ruine thereby. Drunkards bring a curse upon their Children, and poor Posterity after them; nay, it may be one act of drunkenness, and that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by a good man, shall bring a Curse upon some of his Children to the worlds end. Do we not see it in <hi>Noah?</hi> he was a righteous man, and was drunken but once in all his life that we reade of, and much might be said to exense him, in that he knew not that there was an inebriating quality in Wine, nevertheless that <hi>Drunkenness</hi> brought a Curse upon one of his Children, which continueth to this day, although it be Four thousand years since that sin was committed. Whose heart then is it that doth not tremble to live in such an evil? Yea, and this sin is the woful procuring Cause of many Publick Calamities in the world: Was not this one Principal cause of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity? see else <bibl>

been? Since that Drunkards are to be seen up and down in almost every Town, no wonder that the Lord in Judgement maketh the Earth drunk. Nay, come yet nearer home, and look upon this great Town, How hath God threatned us for this, as well as other sins? Remember the sad Fire that was here in this part of the Town about three years ago: And where did that Fire break forth? Began it not at the Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house?

Extraordinary cases must alwayes be excepted, but otherwise, God is not wont to pardon great sins, without bringing first to great sorrows, and heavy breakings of heart for them. Now Drunkenness is a great sin, and therefore conclude thou mayest, that if ever the Lord pardon it to thee, he will first break all thy bones and heart for it: or if the sin be not mourned for, and turned from then <hi>bitter destruction</hi> will be the end of it.

It was partly shewed the last time, That Drunkenness is such an Evil as will assuredly exclude the sinner out of Heaven: Therefore the Lord hath commanded Churches to exclude such out of their Communion, <bibl>

Wherefore the Evangelical Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> speaking of Drunkards, yet faith, <hi>Hell hath enlarged her self, and opened her mouth without measure,</hi> 
                     <bibl>Isa.5. 14.</bibl> Drunkards, tremble at this! Do you not see Hell gaping for you, and opening her mouth wide to receive your Souls, when once they are out of your Bodies? Yea verily, though a man should reform his life in many things very much, though he should be swept and garnished never so, having attained to great gifts, practising many duties forsaking many sins, yet if there be but this one lust of Drunkenness, which still his heart hath a secret love and liking to, there is no remedy, but dying in his present estate, he must be a damned wretch to all eternity. Oh that you would think sadly between God and your own Souls, on the words of the Lord Jesus, <bibl>
                        <hi>Mat. 5. 29. 30.</hi>

should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.</hi> Though this sin of <hi>Drunkenness</hi> may be as dear to thee as life and limbs, though it may be as hard to part with, as to pluck out a right eye, or to cut off a right hand, yet <hi>away with it, away with it,</hi> as ever thou wouldst escape Hell fire.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Know, that if any of you that are here before the Lord this day, shall continue under the guilt of this sin, your iniquity will be hainously aggravated:</hi> for you call your selves Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.

If <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imities</hi> (that is to say, such as prosess that they are the Lords people) be <hi>Drunkards,</hi> surely the Lord will judge them as those that break Wedlock, that break Covenant with him, are judged: yea, and you sin in the day, that is, against Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel light.

And this sin is aggrarated from the place where you live: What? to be a Drunkard in <hi>New-England,</hi> where there are severe and wholsome Laws to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish this iniquity, and some are put to shame for it!

Will you be sinners in <hi>Zion?</hi> Will you be fools in <hi>Israel!</hi> You have moreover been told of the Judgements following this Transgression: you have been sadly, and solemnly warned against this Evil, and that not in a word or two, but by Sermon after Sermon. I remember I had occasion to Preach a whole Sermon, that I might restifie against the sin of Drunkenness, in this place, it is now above nine years ago. I am grieved at my heart, that there should be cause for me now to Preach more Sermons then one, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to bear witness against the same Evil, whereby the eyes of Gods glory are provoked, and his blessed Name is highly dishonoured amongst us.

Will you provoke the Lord to jealousie? Are you stronger then he? But if there be any Drunkards in the Congregation so desperate, as to go on still in the commission of this Trespass against the Lord, Be it known to you, That your blood shall be upon your own heads. I remember what God said to his Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi>

I tremble to think of that, that the blood of any poor Soul should be required of me: I trust in Christ that it shall not be so. I trust that none amongst you shall be able to say to me, when we shall all appear before the Judgement-Seat of Christ, Had you that taught us the Word of God, told us of the evil of our wayes, had you faithfully warned us of our danger, we would not have gone on therein.

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Let every one endeavour the suppression and extirpation of this Evil.</hi> This we should do, by labouring to pray it down. When we are taught to pray that the Name of God may be
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:000179_0032_0FA315C747523CB0"/>
hallowed, therein is implied, That we must pray that this and other such like Evils, whereby his glorious Name is much dishonoured, may be suppressed. And there are some that ought to do more then meerly to pray against it; Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters must bear witness against it in their way: and it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns those that have any Civil Power in their hands, to bear witness against it in their way. If there were Magistrates in this Assembly, I would speak to them in his Name <hi>by whom Kings reign, and Princes decree Justice, and all the Judges of the Earth,</hi> and Exhort them to draw forth the Sword of Justice against this Evil. There are sundry of you that stand in some publick Capacity, <hi>Townsmen, Constables, Grand Jury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, &amp;c.</hi> Behold, the Word of the Lord is unto you in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular this day, I lay the solemn Charge of God upon you, that you do your utmost towards the suppression of this abounding iniquity: Kill this Serpent, before it be grown too big for you. And therefore take heed that there be not through your means, or through your neglect, that which is the Fountain of this Evil; I mean, that there be not a Multiplication of Taverns, and Ale-houses, or the like, more then there is need for. I know that in such a great Town as this, there is need of such Houses, and no sober Minister will speak against the Licensing of them; but I with there be not more of them then there is any need of. Especially see that you keep a vigilant eye over these private, dark Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses, which do more mischief, then all the publick Houses do good, as being the very Sinks of Sin, whereby Youth is wofully corrupted amongst us. And if you finde out any that have made a Trade of this iniquity, and that have got part of their Living by the blood and destruction of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Souls, see that you bring them forth to condign pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment; and as they have been exemplary in sinning, so let them be brought under exemplary punishment, that <hi>all Israel may hear, and fear, and do no more so wickedly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Much more, <hi>Let every one be Exhorted to beware of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing subject to, or coming any way under the dominion of this iniquity.</hi> For Motives, Remember what was said in the last use, as also formerly concerning the Wofulness of this Evil. By way of Direction here, I shall onely say two things:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Take heed of the Occasions and Temptations leading unto
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:000179_0033_0FA315C81F8A7E50"/>
this Evil.</hi> Some there are that will pray against this sin, and yet they will cast themselves upon temptations to it, which is to take Gods Name in vain; even as if a man should put his hand into the fire, and then pray that he might not be burnt: would you not say that such a one did mock the Lord? And what do they do less, who pray that they may not be drunk, and yet will not avoid temptations that lead unto it? <hi>e. g. Idleness</hi> is a temptation leading unto Drunkenness: when vile persons have nothing else to do, then they must go to the Ordinary, and drink till they be drunken. <hi>Idleness and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of bread,</hi> so Idleness and fulness of drink are wont to go together, <bibl>
                        <hi>Ezek. 16.49.</hi>
                     </bibl> Therefore take heed of Idleness, if you would escape Drunkenness. And take heed of <hi>Company<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeping</hi> with those that would draw you unto this Evil; <hi>My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not: walk not thou in the way with them, refrain thy foot from their path.</hi> Take the Counsel which the Holy Ghost giveth by <hi>Solomon,</hi> 
                     <bibl>Prov. 23. 20.</bibl> 
                     <hi>Be not amongst wine-bibbers.</hi> Avoid familiar fellowship with Drunkards; Avoid them as you would do men that have the Plague upon them, yea a Plague that will insect, and be the death of your precious immortal Souls. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that Scripture. <bibl>
                        <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 20.</bibl> 
                     <hi>He that walketh with wise men shall be wise; but a companion of fools shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.</hi> And take heed of being more, then you have any just cause or call to be, in places where a temptation unto this sin is set before you: go not to, tarry not in saverns or Ordinaries, without sufficient reason to bear you out in such a practice. It is a sad thing, that Professors, and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members should many of them be guilty of scandalizing the world in this respect. A carnal creature excuseth himself, saying, Why should not I go frequently to the Tavern, such an one is a Church-member, and I see him there often, such an one is esteemed a godly man, and yet I have seen him sit for hours together there, and why should not I do so as well as he? Thus doth the abuse of your lawful liberty become a snare, and ruine to many a poor Soul. Doth not the Scripture say, <hi>Look not upon the wine?</hi> 
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 31.</bibl> The meaning of which is, that men must avoid all tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions unto Drunkenness, as much as possibly may be. Drunkenness is like the <note n="(t)" place="margin">

But especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when any shall be so vile, as not onely to drink Healths themselves, but to force others to do the like, their practice is very sinful and abominable. Is there any in this Congregation that hath done thus, that hath compelled others to drink Healths, and will you go on to do so still? I testifie from the Lord against that man, whoever he be, that an Heathen shall rise up in Judgement against him, and condemn him at the last day: witness else what is written, <bibl>
                        <hi>Esth.</hi> 1.8.</bibl> it is there said, <hi>that the drinking was according to the law, none did compell; for the King had appointed to all the Officers of his

house, that they should do according to every mans pleasure.</hi> So that those Heathens would not force any man to drink more then he had a minde to. Therefore beware of that evil pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is another Rule, which if it be observed, you shall never be under the dominion of this iniquity, and if it be neglected, all other Precepts will be in vain: it is this, <hi>Make sure of an interest in Jesus Christ, by faith unfeigned in his Name.</hi> There are some, that in giving Directions tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Mortification of this sin of Drunkenness, say to those that are guilty of it, that they must Pray, and adde Fastings to their Prayers, and Vows to their Fastings: all which things are good, and see that you attend them in their due order. But alas! the main thing of all is left out, if an interest in Christ be not sought after, and made sure of. All Prayers, Tears, Resolutions, Fastings, Vows against this sin, will never subdue it without Christ. Go to Jesus Christ for power against this, and all Corruptions: if thou art once in Christ, thou mayest by faith obtain power from the blood of Christ, for the killing of this sin; if thou art in Christ, his Spirit also will mortifie it: therefore the Scripture faith, <hi>that if you through the Spirit do mortifie the deeds of the body,</hi>

                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13.</bibl> Make sure then of an interest in Jesus Christ, and his Spirit will subdue and mortifie every lust in thy heart.</p>
                  <p>The last word of <hi>Exhortation</hi> shall be unto those that have been guilty of this woful sin of Drunkenness; Be this day excited and perswaded <hi>to repent, and turn from this Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi> Some of you have through Temptation been drawn into this Evil. How many guilty, accusing Consciences are there here before the Lord? Oh repent of what you have done, if ever you have given way to Temptation, so as to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with this so vile an abomination.

Repentance was too late. Think seriously on that Scripture, <bibl>
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.11.12.13.</bibl> 
                     <hi>Now it is high time to awake out of sleep, the night is far spent, the day is at hand; let us therefore cast off the works of darkness—Let us walk honestly, not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness.</hi> Do not delay your Repentance, but <hi>now</hi> practice it. <hi>Anstine</hi> I remember consesseth, that he lived in those sins, in his vain youthful dayes, before his Conversion, and he had many se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Convictions upon his Conscience, thinking with himself that tomorrow, or sometime hereafter, he would repent of, and turn from those vanities: but on a certain time it seemed to him as if he heard a voice from Heaven saying to him, <hi>Tolle &amp; lige, Take up and reade;</hi> a Bible being by him, he taketh it up, and goeth to reading in it, and the first place which his eyes fixed on, was this Scripture last mentioned, and the Lord set in with it upon his heart, so as that he cried out, <hi>And why not</hi> now <hi>Lord?</hi> I have said, that <hi>hertafter</hi> I would leave my rioting, and drinking, and chambering, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonness, but let me do it <hi>now</hi> Lord. Do you that are Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards say and do the lake, resolve upon present Repentance without delaying one day, or one hour longer.

To encourage to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and to break the heart of the vilest Drunkard, I'le
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:000179_0037_0FA315CC7A180A30"/>
put you in minde of two Scriptures: the one is that, <bibl>
                        <hi>1 Pet. 4.3.</hi>
                     </bibl> 
                     <hi>The time past of our life may sussice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquettings, &amp;c.</hi> So that those Christians had afore their Conversion been wofully guilty of this iniquity, but upon true Repentance they were <hi>sprinkled with the blood of Jesus Christ,</hi> as the beginning of the Epistle sheweth; that is to say, the blood of Jesus Christ cleansed them from the guilt of this sin, and obtained pardoning mercy for them. Another Scripture to encourage you to Repentance, is that <bibl>1 <hi>Cor.</hi>6.11.</bibl> where the Apostle having said to the <hi>Gorintbians,</hi> that no Drunkard (that is, so living and dying without Repentance) shall inherit the Kingdome of God, he addeth withall, <hi>Such were some of you, but you are washed, you are sanctified, you are Justified in the Name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi> Know there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that although thou hast been guilty of this great sin, it may be an hundred and an hundred times, yet thou mayest be justified from it in the Name of the Lord Jesus, if indeed thou dost repent of it. But then your Repentance must be thus qualified!</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>You must mourn before the Lord, that ever you dishonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but Name by this Transgression.</hi> Let me speak to you in the words of the Prophet <hi>Joel,</hi> 
                     <bibl>Joel 1.5.</bibl> 
                     <hi>Awake ye Drunkards, and weep and howl, all ye drinkers of wine.</hi> O thou Drunkard, now let tears be thy drink; go home, and appear before the Lord in secret, and there lament with a sorrowful heart, that ever thou hast thus sinned against him. Do as <hi>David</hi> did, who faith, <bibl>
                        <hi>Psa.</hi> 38.18.</bibl> 
                     <hi>I will declare mine iniquity, I will be sorry for my sin.</hi> What sin was that? truly, his sin in making <hi>Uriah</hi> drunk. So do thou be sorry that ever thou hast made thy self drunk.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>You must also forsake this sin:</hi> that's implied in true Repentance. And I speak this the rather, because I know there have been some Drunkards that would bewa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> their sin with many tears, and yet it may be, go and be drunk again the next week: that's no true Repentance. Thy heart must be so broken <hi>for</hi> this sin, as to be broken <hi>from</hi> it, otherwise though a man should confess his sin till his tongue be worn to the stumps, though he should pray against it till Heaven
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:000179_0038_0FA315CC8948A1F8"/>
and Earth shake, though he should weep Seas of Tears for it, yet if he will not forsake it, all his Confessions, Prayers, and Tears shall never save him. Yea, he must forsake it not onely as to his Conversation, or outwardly, but inwardly, so as to have no affection, or secret love, and liking to this Abomination. O therefore say as once <hi>Ephraim</hi> did, <hi>What have I to do any more with Idols?</hi> So say thou, What have I to do any more with my wicked Companions in sin? What have I to do any more with Drunkenness, or any other ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity that I have <hi>in times past</hi> loved and lived in? And then thou mayest hope to finde pardoning mercy from the Lord; according to that gracious word, <bibl>
                        <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.13.</bibl> 
                     <hi>Whoso con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth, and forsaketh, shall have mercy.</hi> Now the Lord of Heaven grant it, to many of your Souls, who are sadly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the word that hath been spoken to you in his Name.</p>
