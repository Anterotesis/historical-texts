            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I WAS</hi> a ſpectator of the ſcene of diſtreſs, which I am about to narrate. I was at Mr. Joſeph Metcalf's in Lebanon, and I think no place has ſuffered more than <hi>his,</hi> and the farms which lie in the direction in which the ſtorm went, as it paſſed from the ſouthward to the northward. The appearance of it was ſo ſingular that I paid particular at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the clouds, while they were forming; and as ſoon as the hail ceaſed, I went and viewed it very attentively.</p>
            <p>I have ſince endeavoured to obtain as accurate information as poſſible, which I mean to lay before the public, in as impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial a manner as poſſible. I am not one of the ſufferers, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I cannot be under any inducement to exaggerate it, from motives of intereſt. The following ſheets are dedicated to a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and impartial public, for their peruſal, by their obedient and humble ſervant.</p>

            <head>ACCOUNT OF A HAIL STORM.</head>
            <p>AS I am about to give an account of a hail ſtorm, which happened on the 15th of July, perhaps never equalled ſince that in Egypt, according to the Moſaic ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, 3290 years ſince, I hope my readers will pardon my making a few obſervations, that will naturally occur to my mind, in giving an account of ſuch an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry phenomenon.</p>
            <p>I have wiſhed for ſome time that a more able pen might be employed on the ſubject than mine; but as no one has undertaken it, in any other way than for a public newſpaper, which will ſoon be loſt and worn out, ſo that future generations will have no deſcription of it, and thoſe who are now children will have nothing to help their memory, and when they come to manhood, will have only a confuſed and bewildered idea of it, by the preſſing deſire of a number of friends, I have undertaken a deſcription of it.</p>
            <p>Monday, the 15th of July, 1799, the day on which this ever memorable hail ſtorm happened, was very warm; by Farenheit's thermometer, I ſhould judge it to have been from 90 to 92; but as I had not the benefit of one, I cannot aſcertain what the degree of heat was.</p>
            <p>About one o'clock a cloud paſſed over from the weſt. This cloud I obſerved role very high; the drops of rain which fell were uncommonly large, but it was nothing more than a light ſhower. After this cloud paſſed, it ſeemed to collect a great quantity of electricity, which produced a continued roar, for ſome time, that did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be wholly the effect of lightning. I obſerved to a friend that I thought it was hail, for the cloud appeared like it. I have ſince been informed that hail fell from it at Preſton, ſeveral miles eaſt of this, as large as a robin's egg, but in ſmall numbers. This cloud kept its courſe to the eaſtward, till it met the more denſe air of the ſea, when it appeared to lie without motion. About two
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:035405_0004_1004BA0208E6EA58"/>o'clock, another cloud roſe from the weſt, and ſettled to the S. E. till it met the ſea breeze, which threw it back o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the land.</p>
            <p>There was no threatening appearance in this cloud; it was attended with ſome lightning and thunder, which were at a diſtance. About five o'clock a third cloud ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the W. N. W. attended with lightning and thunder, and looked darker than the former ones. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſix and ſeven o'clock, that in the ſouth looked un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commonly black, and moved with great ſwiftneſs, taking its courſe to the northward, preceded by flying clouds of a lead colour, ſuch as are not uncommon to be ſeen in a heavy thunder ſtorm. The two clouds in the eaſt and weſt then ſeemed to move as if to form a junction, whilſt that in the ſouth ſtill kept its courſe with great rapidity, and ſoon overſhadowed us, rolling in various forms, like pillars of ſmoke, and almoſt entirely obſcured the light of the ſun. The heavens ſeemed clad in ſackcloth, and ſhrouded with darkneſs, whilſt lightning and thunder wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed the war of the elements. The appearance was truly frightful; but the ſcene which ſoon followed ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed the ſcenery. Where ſhall I find language to paint this in its true colours?</p>
            <p>As the painter falls ſhort of giving a likeneſs for want of colours, ſo ſhall I fail for want of words; for words can only convey ſuch ideas as have been in our minds; and I conceive that none of my readers, who were not preſent, ever beheld ſuch a ſublime, grand and awful ſcene as this preſented. A few minutes before ſeven the cloud exhib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited a braſſy appearance in the weſt. This was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately followed by the rain, which poured down as if fed by a water ſpout, and laſted three or four minutes, when hail began to fall, larger than any which I had ever ſeen. They were as large as a turkey's egg, in vaſt numbers, and many were larger. Terrour now pervaded even the brute creation; every creature ſought for ſhelter; but our houſes were ſcarce able to afford us an aſylum from this dreadful ſtorm. The hail, urged on by the rapidity of the wind, ſoon demoliſhed the glaſs, and the roar of this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous ſtorm ſilenced the loudeſt thunder, ſo that it could not be heard. The rain ſtill continued. The lightning was inceſſant and ſeemed to hail mingled with fire. All countenances turned pale, and every heart gathered ſadneſs. The terrific ſound of this war of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:035405_0005_1004BA055AF90B68"/>the air filled with ſolid ſubſtances, which cut the leaves, fruit and ſmall limbs of the trees, whilſt continued flaſhes of lightning tinged every thing of a livid appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, added horrour to the gloom, and filled every one with aſtoniſhment. It ſeemed as if the laws of nature were changed, or that the elements had waged war with each other. For the ſpace of ten or twelve minutes, it preſented a ſcene which I cannot deſcribe. It appeared, as if the final diſſolution of all things had now commenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I expected every thing would be laid proſtrate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it. The earth trembled, as if ſhocked by an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake. Children were crying to their parents for help, whilſt they ſtood the aſtoniſhed ſpectators of this inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribable ſcene. Every heart ſeemed to melt like wax before the fire. In ſhort, nothing could ſurpaſs the ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a feeling mind on this occaſion. After ten or twelve minutes it abated for a ſhort ſpace, when the rain again fell like a torrent, and laſted ſome time, attended with ſharp lightning and heavy thunder. After this a ſolemn ſtillneſs prevailed during the whole night, which, when compared with the confuſed noiſe that had been ſounding in our ears, it ſeemed as if we were poſſeſſed with different ſenſations, or that all nature was huſhed in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. There was the moſt perfect calm I ever ſaw. The day following was calm and pleaſant; but nothing appeared beautiful; no tuneful bird was left to welcome in the cheerleſs day. The inhabitants of the airy regions fell the firſt victims to the relentleſs hand of diſordered elements, and were found in the fields and woods, ſome dead, others with their wings broken, and not one was to be ſeen or heard unhurt. The ſmall animals of all kinds, who had no ſhelter, ſhared the ſame fate: among which were fowls, pigs, &amp;c. In many inſtances, ſheep were killed. I ſaw one that was killed; it appeared as if ſtruck on the top of the head by a hail ſtone, which beat off the ſkin two inches in length, and one in breadth.</p>
            <p>When the ſtorm firſt began, the cattle ſhewed the greateſt ſigns of terrour they could expreſs. They ran and roared like bullocks, who were going to the ſlaughter, and ſought for ſhelter. Some broke out of the fields, and ran to the firſt covert that could be found: thoſe who had no ſhelter were cut and bruiſed very much.</p>
            <p>No perſon was killed, for there was no one out but a few minutes. A Mr. Johnſon was a few rods from his
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:035405_0006_1004BA07D49A23B0"/>houſe, and before he could reach it he was knocked down three times; a number of others were knocked down and bruiſed very much.</p>
            <p>The fields of graſs and grain were not only beaten down, but cut to pieces, and only fit for the hogs and cattle. A gentleman informed me that he reapt or mowed up ten ſhocks of the beſt rye he had, which, on threſhing, produced only three quarts to a ſhock. Fields of graſs, which were mown but a few hours before the ſtorm com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced to walk over them, the day following it was difficult to tell which had been mown and which had not. The feeding lands were cut to pieces ſo that the feed was ſpoiled for ſome weeks. In corn fields, which were as good as any I had ſeen this year, and which I was obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame afternoon, on the day following not a ſpire was left ſtanding, and almoſt every one cut off with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in four inches of the ground. In fields in general, ſcarce a ſpire was left, and the induſtrious huſbandman imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ploughed his fields, and ſowed them with buck wheat; this being the only reſource left by which he could obtain ſomething to ſupply the calls of nature for himſelf and family. Barley, flax, beans, peas, potatoes, gardens, &amp;c. are entirely deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>The trees are cut and bruiſed very much. Young fruit trees are almoſt, if not entirely deſtroyed. Peach and Cherry trees ſuffered moſt; many of them are dead al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; others I think will die, a great part of the bark being bruiſed or beaten off on that ſide toward the ſouth. Some orchards are almoſt ſtripped of leaves, as well as fruit. Many fruit and foreſt trees are blown down. Trees, buildings, and fences are ſo marked they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, many years, the ſtanding monuments of the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the ſtorm. The bark on large trees begins to grow out, as if ſcarified by the head of an ax. A week or ten days after, the wood lands exhibibited the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of woods through which large fires have paſſed. The ſhingles on the houſes are ſplit to pieces very much. All the glaſs on that ſide next the ſtorm was broken; and, in many inſtances, the ſaſh was not proof againſt its vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Two barns in Bozrah were entirely demoliſhed, and one unroofed.</p>
            <p>The ſtorm began in the weſternmoſt part of Bozrah, in the County of Newlondon, in Connecticut, and took its courſe from S. W. to N. E. was about nine miles in
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:035405_0007_1004BA0961CBB3F0"/>length, and four in width. In its courſe it took the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the towns of Bozrah, Franklin, and ſome part of Lebanon. The eaſt part of the pariſh of Goſhen, in Lebanon, and the eaſt edge of the old town, ſuffered as ſeverely as any part of the three towns.</p>
            <p>I ſaid this ſtorm began in Bozrah; but I would remark that a few ſmall hail ſtones fell from this cloud at Lyme and Eaſthaddam, as it paſſed to the northward. It ſtripped the leaves of corn a little, but the damage was trifling.</p>
            <p>When it began in Bozrah, it was very ſevere, and the hail was nearly as large as in any place where the ſtorm went. When this cloud moved to the north, it moved very quick, till it came nearly over the place where the hail began to fall firſt, when it rolled into the atmoſphere, like the ſmoke of buildings on fire.</p>
            <p>I ſtood and viewed the cloud till it overſhadowed and almoſt deprived us of light. The lightning was almoſt one continued blaze, but ſo high that it did not ſeem to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the earth; and the thunder roared as if at a diſtance, and was nearly one continued peal, till the hail began to fall, when it had to ſubmit to ſuperior ſound, as muſketry are ſilenced when a cannonade begins.</p>
            <p>Whilſt theſe movements were taking place, there was but little air, till the hail began to fall, when it blowed with great violence. It blew in the ſame direction, that is, from S. W. to N. E. except in one or two inſtances, where it whirled ſo as to break the glaſs on the oppoſite ſide of the houſe from that on which the ſtorm had been beating.</p>
            <p>But a few ſeconds had elapſed, after the firſt hail ſtones fell, before they fell as faſt as at any time during the ſtorm. It run in what is called veins. In the weſtern part of the extent of the ſtorm the hail were the largeſt, and fell ſo as to cover the ground, if they had been ſtrewed equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on it. After this cloud had paſſed four or five miles, the hail gradually decreaſed in numbers and bigneſs, till the ſtorm ceaſed. In ſome places they fell four inches deep. It differed very much in depth, even in places that day in the direction in which it went. In ſome places, by travelling forty rods, you might go from where vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was in its higheſt perfection to where nothing but deſolation ſtrewed the face of nature. The two heavieſt veins were on the weſt and eaſt ſide of this tract of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation.</p>
            <p>

The great quantity of rain, which fell during the ſtorm, and a few minutes after, waſhed it into heaps, ſo that, where it lodged againſt walls and fences, it was three or four feet deep, which lay ſome time. In the meadow of Benjamin Throop, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> hail ſtones were taken up on the ninth day after, as large as a muſket ball. The weather was very hot, during this time. I would not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that they were wholly uncovered, for they were covered with graſs, which was cut up and waſhed together with them. In ſome places the rain fell before the hail, in others the hail fell firſt.</p>
            <p>The ſtate of the air was changed in a few minutes, from being very hot, to the degree of cold that it felt like a hail ſtorm in winter; by means of which many took cold, and injured their health very much. In general, they uſed every precaution, which was in their power; ſuch as addition of clothing, uſe of ſpirits, building of fires, &amp;c. Notwithſtanding all theſe precautions, many were ſeized with cramps and ague fits.</p>
            <p>Perſons who viſited the place twenty four hours after, ſaid that, in travelling half a mile, it ſeemed as if they had got into another climate. People who went from the place ſaid the ſame.</p>
            <p>When this ſtorm abated, or more properly had paſſed over, the noiſe gradually ceaſed, like the noiſe of an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake. I have obſerved that the earth trembled; whether it was occaſioned by the wind and hail beating on it, or from there being an uncommon quantity of electricity received into it from the cloud, is not for me to ſay.—The jar of it was like that which we feel in a violent thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſtorm.</p>
            <p>The hail ſtones, as I have obſerved, were as large as a turkey's egg, and many were larger. I meaſured ſome, which were four inches and a quarter by five and a half in circumference, and were uncommonly hard; the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of them was like a number of ſmall ones congealed together, and very rough. Some were of a conical figure; others were ſhaped ſomewhat like a cheſnut bur, when open, being notched on the out ſide, and appeared as if you had taken a number of ſmall ones and put them into a large one about half their diameter, which left a ſmall hollow, or cavity, about the bigneſs of the end of a finger on one or both ſides. Some were round and ſmooth as glaſs, looked white and clear, like ice that is congealed
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:035405_0009_1004BA108019F488"/>from pure water, in extreme cold weather. The other kind were of the colour of common ice, and of a dirty caſt, eſpecially thoſe that were largeſt, and fell firſt.—Many of theſe lumps of ice were ſhaped like a ſnow ball, that is preſſed with a hand, inclining to be round, but not ſmooth. There were none, which I ſaw, ſmaller than a muſketball; and there were more of them that exceeded the bigneſs of a ſmall hen's egg, than there were of that ſize, except thoſe which were round, and they were not in large numbers. The greateſt part of the ice fell in pieces larger than a ſmall hen's egg, that is, the balance of weight was on that ſide.</p>
            <p>This is as it appeared where I was, but they were not ſo large in any other vein, as that which was on the weſt edge.</p>
            <p>On viewing ſome of the largeſt hail ſtones, I obſerved black ſpecks and ſtreaks in them, which, on examining. I found to be ſpecks of dirt, and leaves of dry graſs, of an eighth of an inch in length, in the middle of the ſolid ice. This is an obſervation which perhaps no one has made beſide me. There were a number of perſons preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and no one obſerved it, till I ſpake of it to them.—The mentioning of this circumſtance obliges me to make ſome obſervations, to make it plain and obvious to my readers; and, as I am not a philoſopher, I hope they will pardon me, if I do not ſatisfy their minds on this head.—This ſtorm began with conſiderable wind, ſome miles to the ſouthward of the place where the hail firſt fell, that in ſome places was attended with a whirl, which would conſequently throw thoſe light particles of matter into the air to a great height. I would not be underſtood that it was a proper whirlwind; it only whirled in ſome places, as it does many times in the beginning of a thunder ſtorm, this was what carried them into the clouds. The next thing is to ſhew what occaſioned the hail to form as it did. When that cloud in the ſouth moved toward the north, thoſe two in the eaſt and weſt, whether impelled by the more denſe air of the ſea from the eaſt, and the cool breezes from the great lakes in the weſt, or from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of attraction in themſelves, I ſay from which of theſe, or from both operating together, is not for me to determ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, theſe clouds moved toward each other. They then lay, as I judged, in a direction from that in the ſouth, about N. E. and N. W. at ſuch a diſtance as nearly to
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:035405_0010_1004BA120BD3B1D8"/>form a right angle, and all ſeemed to ruſh to the centre. That in the eaſt moved on, while that in the weſt moved with much more force, and at the ſame time that in the ſouth approached us with great rapidity, as if it would bear down all before it, when it met thoſe two from the eaſt and weſt. Theſe three currents of air meeting each oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, it was impoſſible for them to have vent any other way than by rolling into the empty ſpace which was above them.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe three ſtreams of water, of great force, ſhould meet each other, they would naturally boil into the air to a conſiderable height, and that ſtream which was of the greateſt force would ſtill keep its courſe, preſſing the oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er two into that ſpace which was void. This I have done to illuſtrate the idea. The two currents of air from the N. E. and N. W. meeting with that from the ſouth, which was much ſtronger than either of the other two, or both of them united, and each being ſupported by a freſh breeze of wind, it rolled them into the atmoſphere, almoſt, if not quite, above the circumambient, or ſurrounding air, when the intenſe cold congealed the water, which was in the cloud; and that, when congealed, fell, having a great degree of froſt in themſelves, and falling through the great body of water, which lay below, they ſtruck each other and congealed into a ſolid maſs before they fell to the earth, which occaſioned them to be of ſuch an uncommon bigneſs.</p>
            <p>To ſupport this idea, I ſhall make ſome obſervations, which I think are in favour of it. The day being uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly warm, the air was expanded very much, which occaſioned the clouds to riſe higher than uſual, and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forced together, would naturally riſe to a vaſt height.</p>
            <p>Air is of ſuch a nature that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it may be preſſed to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain degree, and when it comes to have vent, being of a more elaſtic quality than water, it riſes much eaſier, and, conſequently, much higher, with the ſame force. As water, being put in motion at the bottom, riſes to the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, and boils into the air; ſo the air, being pent up or preſſed together in ſome degree, and then getting vent upward, being crowded on by the ſame winds, it muſt riſe far above the ſurface of the common air, when in a ſtate of equilibrium, or equal balance. As water riſes above the ſurface of water in proportion with the force that puts it in motion, at the bottom; ſo theſe clouds muſt riſe above the ſurface of the common air, in proportion
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:035405_0011_1004BA13A67AE420"/>with the force with which they were ſupported.—Theſe clouds being thrown to a great height, and being deprived of heat, it gave the cold (which is only a leſs degree of heat) a greater chance to operate on them.</p>
            <p>To ſtrengthen this idea, I would obſerve that the hail ſtones were larger in the weſtern extent of the ſtorm than in the eaſtern part of it; that cloud from the weſt being ſupported by a much ſtronger wind, which would throw it higher into the cold regions, above the reflection of heat.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now make a few obſervations, for which I am indebted to particular gentlemen, on whoſe veracity I may rely. Some miles weſt of the ſtorm, a number of gentlemen informed me that the wind blew very hard from the weſt, when the cloud paſſed from the weſtward toward that in the ſouth.</p>
            <p>In Norwich, a few miles eaſt, a number of gentlemen informed me, that when the cloud in the eaſt moved tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard the S. W. that in the ſouth moved very ſwift to meet it, and that in the weſt coming up, they ſeemed to roll in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the air, for ſome time, when the other clouds gave way, or rather united, with that in the ſouth, and rolled on to the northward. The wind blew freſh from the N. E. at that place, all the while theſe clouds were forming, and continued ſo till that from the ſouth appeared to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power the other two, when they moved on, attended with ſharp lightning and heavy thunder.</p>
            <p>In Goſhen, three or four miles weſt, it appeared to roll in a wild, confuſed, diſordered form, exhibiting an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance that was very ſingular; the cloud looked of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect black, and ſtreams of lightning ran in every direction. Spectators viewed it with a degree of anxiety, for thoſe who were doomed to feel its violence. The roar was one continued ſound, all the time theſe clouds were paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Sometimes the peals of thunder could be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, at others they could not. I was at Eaſthaddam, five days after the ſtorm, a number of perſons informed me that the wind blew heavy from the ſouth while this was paſſing and continued ſome time after it paſſed.</p>
            <p>Major Throop, of Bozrah, a man of obſervation, ſays he ſtood and viewed it from a north window, and that at one time it fell ſo faſt it appeared like a bank of hail in the air, and an object could not be diſtinguiſhed at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of three rods. The hail looked whiter in the laſt of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:035405_0012_1004BA158AACFC88"/>the ſtorm than in the fore part of it. The rain immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately followed, which fell like a ſolid body of water and waſhed them into heaps.</p>
            <p>If the obſervations which I have made are juſt, I think it will be eaſy to account for the particles of matter being in the middle of theſe pieces of ice. On cutting them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen it was evident, they were a number of ſmall ones con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed together, and the particles of matter appeared to lie between thoſe firſt congealed pebbles of ice.</p>
            <p>The following is what cannot be aſcertained, therefore I ſhall only lay it down as a conjectural idea, which is this, that thoſe hail ſtones were kept in the air for ſome time, by whirling. This, perhaps, you will ſay is a chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera of my own brain, and true, the whole theory which I have advanced is mine, and from my own obſervation; but, in the preſent caſe, it is not ſo eaſily demonſtrated from facts, as the former ones have been; notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this I will make a few remarks on the ſubject. When currents of water are forced againſt each other they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce whirlpools, eddies &amp;c. When currents of air are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt each other they produce whirlwinds. The objector will ſay, who ever heard of a whirlwind in the air, when there was none on the earth? In anſwer to this, I would aſk, if they ever ſaw a whirlpool on the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the water, when objects lay unmoved and unaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected at the bottom? He will then ſay, that that conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of air, which forms a rapid whirlwind, would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſettle to the earth, if it began in the air? In anſwer to it, I will ſtate one propoſition, which is this, ſuppoſe a large tube to be placed ſo as to have three ſtreams of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter forced into it, would they not boil into the air and run over the top? Place this tube ſeveral feet under water, and would it not produce whirlpools and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the water, which was above it, but I think it would not affect the water any great depth below the top of the tube? That there were three currents of air forced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, has been proved. The compreſſion of the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding atmoſphere ſufficiently ſupplied the place of a tube. When theſe three breezes of wind met, the clouds, filled with water, were driven into the empty ſpace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, where the air immediately became expanded, by being where there was no ſurrounding air, to keep it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed, as it had been, and when this rarification, or thinning of the air, took place, thoſe heavy particles of water inſtnata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſly
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:035405_0013_1004BA1A962766E8"/>fell together; and formed into drops before the ſpace, in which they then were, became cooled ſo as to give the cold a chance to operate on them; theſe drops were no ſooner formed, than they were congealed into ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>id ice, and fell into thoſe whirlwinds, which were below, that kept them from falling for ſome time, and every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon muſt be ſenſible that the air, in a whirlwind, is very cold, and being fed by this cloud, filled with particles of water, they ſtill kept increaſing, by ſtriking together and freezing. One thing is certain, theſe pieces of ice would ſtick together, ſo as to lift each other. I took three or four, and put them together, then took hold of one, it would lift the whole as a magnet lifts a bit of ſteel; this they would do, when but a ſmall part touched each other. The reaſon of this, is that for which I ſhall not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to account, but leave it for the reader to make his own comment on it, as he pleaſes. I will cloſe, with making one more remark on the ſubject, in order to prove the Hypotheſis, which I have advanced, as far as I am capable of doing it, and which is this, that thoſe hail ſtones, which were round fell laſt. In my own ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, I ſaw none till the laſt of the ſhower. As ſoon as the ſtorm ceaſed, I went out and viewed the hail be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the laſt ſhower fell, which followed in about three minutes. The round ones appeared to lie on the top of the piles of hail, as round ſnow lies on the top of the ſnow, after a ſnow ſtorm. My idea, in this reſpect, is this, that thoſe hail ſtones were high in the air, when congealed, and met with nothing but the remaining par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of water, through which the others had paſſed, which muſt be cooled to the freezing point, much near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the earth, than when it began, and would conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly congeal much eaſier, which increaſed them to the ſize that I have mentioned. The rain, which fell after the hail, was very cold. It felt like the coldeſt water I ever ſaw. In my enquiry on this head, two perſons inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me that the firſt hail ſtone they ſaw was round, but ſmall; not larger than a muſket ball; and that after this they ſaw none but thoſe rough ones, till the laſt of the ſtorm. This is a ſtill farther confirmation of what I laid down, as a reaſon for thoſe hailſtones being round, which fell laſt, for thoſe which fell firſt would not have any thing but water to paſs, which was not cooled ſo much as to freeze ſo eaſily, therefore they were ſmaller than thoſe which fell laſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:035405_0014_1004BA1C22FB71C0"/>
The foregoing hypotheſis, which I have advanced, is the reſult of my own obſervation. I have compiled it, without any kind of aſſiſtance; and whether the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which I have laid down, are founded on reaſon or not, I leave it for the candid and impartial reader to judge: and, if they are not concluſive, I hope he will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pity than cenſure me for my weakneſs.</p>
            <p>The above ſtorm has laid waſte one of the moſt beautiful and flouriſhing parts of the country: a place where the people lived in eaſe and plenty, but not in luxury and idleneſs. Their cows afforded milk, their fields afforded bread their trees yielded fruit, all theſe they had in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; but the preſent year will not afford them the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre pittance that the bogs of Ireland, and the inhoſpitable regions of Iceland afford the wretched inhabitants of their ſoil. No, not ſo much as a few potatoes. A great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe of fortune, indeed, to have their ſituation changed, from one of the beſt to one of the pooreſt. When win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter came they uſed to view their granaries filled with grain, their barns filled with hay, their wives and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters fulfilling what Solomon ſays of the induſtrious wife, "She layeth her hand to the ſpindle, and her hands hold the diſtaff." The preſent year, their repoſitories of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good, will be to them as lonely as the tombs of their anceſtors. They once ſtretched out their hands to the poor, but now they are empty, and have only to reflect, like the unhappy wretch, who is wrecked on the barren coaſt, that once he was in plenty, and then he did to others what he would wiſh them to do for him, ſtill hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the ſunſhine of proſperity will gild the days of his future life, with that plenty, which he has ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the labours of his hands; and that he ſhall then enjoy, with a refined happineſs, (unknown to any but thoſe whoſe feelings have been ſtrung with the tender cords of miſery and misfortune) that it is good to be in proſperity, and not in adverſity.</p>
            <p>The preſent diſtreſſing ſtorm ſerves many noble and wiſe purpoſes; a few of which I ſhall mention; not that I mean to ſay what were the motives in the innate Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of JEHOVAH for bringing this upon the land, but only ſuch as it ought to ſerve us, as the creatures on whom it is ſent. In the firſt place, it ſerves the noble purpoſe of trying the charity of the world, of which, I ſhall ſpeak more at large in the following ſheets. It
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:035405_0015_1004BA1DD2FCCB48"/>likewiſe ſerves the purpoſe of confirming, in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, the truth of ſacred hiſtory. There are many things, ſpoken of in the Bible, at which infidelity laughs, and Chriſtians look upon them as figures, and no doubt many of them are ſuch; yet there are many, which have and will be literally fulfilled. The firſt, of which the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred writings make mention, is that in Egypt, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened 1491 years before the Chriſtian aera. We find that it ſmote every thing that was in the field, both man and beaſt, and brake every tree of the field; notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this, there is good ground to believe it was not more ſevere than the preſent one, and, by ſome things, it ſeems it was not quite ſo ſevere. We read that the wheat and rye were not ſmitten, becauſe they were not grown up, but barley and flax were, for the flax was bowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the barley was in the ear; from this circumſtance, many have imagined that it happened at the ſame time in the year. For the information of thoſe, I ſhall take the liberty to quote a few paſſages from Charles Thomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's obſervations on the productions of Egypt.</p>
            <p>"In Egypt they have two harveſts. What is called the ſpring harveſt is from January to May, and a winter harveſt about October. For the latter, about March, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the land is overflowed, they ſow rice, Indian wheat, and what they call corn of Damaſcus, which produces a large cane, and has an ear like millet. At the ſame time, they plant ſugar cane, for they all require a great deal of water, eſpecially rice, which is reaped before the flood is quite gone, and removed to dry ground. The largeſt crops of this are produced near Damietta and Roſetta. The rice has an ear ſomewhat like oats, and the grain looks like barley before the huſk is taken off. Their ſpring corn, and vegetables, are ſown in November, or ſomething ſooner or later, according as the waters retire, but earlier where it is not overflowed by the river. Theſe are wheat, which is all bearded, and barley, which has ſix rows of grain in one ear, and is uſed chiefly for horſes: as alſo flax, lentiles, lupines, and things of the ſame nature. The wheat, which they ſow at this time of the year, they reap in March and April." <hi>Charles Thompſon's Travels in the years</hi> 1732 <hi>and</hi> 1733, <hi>through Syria, Egypt, and the Holy Land, volume</hi> II.</p>
            <p>In regard to this, that ſo many lives were loſt in that ſtorm and none in this, ſome may ſay that it was not ſo
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:035405_0016_1004BA1FB11FE998"/>ſevere as it was in Egypt. On this I ſhall make ſome obſervations. Egypt is a low flat country, overflowed by the river Nile, which riſes to a vaſt height, occaſioned by the great rains, which fall on the mountains in Abyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinia, and Ethiopia, (for it never rains in Egypt) this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions it to riſe, and when it is at its height, the dikes are cut, and nearly the whole face of the country is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed.</p>
            <p>This country, ſays a traveller, at two ſeaſons affords one of the moſt beautiful proſpects in nature, viz. at the time the flood is at its height, and when the country is in its verdure, after the flood has ſubſided. When the flood is at its height, it appears like one continued ſea, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed with villages, which are built on eminences, raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by art, ſo that nothing can be ſeen, but ſmall villages, the tops of orange trees, &amp;c. which affords a moſt beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and pictureſque appearance. I find no mention made by travellers, of any trees growing in that part of the country, except orange and fig trees, which any perſon muſt know, who is acquainted with them, that they would afford but an indifferent ſhelter from a hail ſtorm, like the preſent one. The orange tree reſembles the common pear tree, more than any other, only it grows more ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and not ſo high. The fig tree grows ſomewhat like a ſumach in the bigneſs of its body and limbs. Such trees would afford but an indifferent ſhelter, for man or beaſt. The Egyptians, living, as I obſerved, in ſmall villages, muſt work at a great diſtance from their houſes, as men do with us, who work in meadows. Suppoſing this to be the caſe, no wonder all were killed, who were in the field, for it is certain no one could have lived, if he had been obliged to go but a ſmall diſtance in this ſtorm.—Beſide this, the Egyptians were not uſed to the cold, which would kill them much ſooner than it would the hardy ſons of America, who are inured to heat and cold, with its various changes; but in the preſent caſe it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt too hard for ſome conſtitutions. This ſtorm laſted but a few minutes, and that laſted ſome time.</p>
            <p>From all theſe circumſtances, it is no ways ſtrange, that man and beaſt both died, allowing that it was not ſo ſevere as the preſent one.</p>
            <p>If any of my readers are not ſatisfied with the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which I have given of Egypt, I wiſh them to view the travels of Doctors Pocoke and Shaw, Meſſrs. Thomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Bruce, and others.</p>

The next that is mentioned in Scripture, happened in the land of Paleſtine, forty years after that in Egypt, which was in the year 1451, and is thus recorded in the book of Joſhua, at the Xth chap. and the 11th verſe—"And it came to paſs as they fled from before Iſrael and were going down to Beth-horon, that JEHOVAH caſt down great hail ſtones from heaven upon them unto Aze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kah, and they died: there were more which died with hail ſtones than they which the children of Iſrael ſlew with the ſword.</p>
            <p>In both theſe ſtorms many lives were loſt, but I would remark that it is no evidence the ſtorms were more ſevere. It was the expreſs purpoſe, for which GOD rained it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. In the preſent caſe, he did not deſign it for the purpoſe of deſtroying the people, but herbage and fruits of the earth. When judgments anſwer the end, for which they are deſigned, it is ſufficient. One queſtion I would aſk, and that is, would not the ſlaughter have been great, had the preſent ſtorm been rained on a flying army, for the ſpace of a whole day?</p>
            <p>I could produce more from the ſacred pages, but I will now turn to what is called profane hiſtory, after making one remark, which is this; there are many things, which are ſpoken in ſcripture as certain to be fulfilled, which are not more improbable than what has happened before our eyes, and yet even Chriſtians doubt of their being ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, and ſpiritualize away the literal meaning of them, which tends greatly to injure the belief in, and reputation of the bible.</p>
            <p>Diodorus, a very great hiſtorian, ſpeaks of hail ſtones, which weighed a pound and more.—Philoſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus mentions hail, which weighed eight pounds. Thoſe writings, left by the philoſophers, who lived in the early ages of the world are very often doubted, and true, we have not ſo much reaſon to give the ſame credit to them as we do to thoſe which are eſteemed the ſacred oracles of Divine truth; yet we ought to do them the juſtice, to aſk ourſelves whether the ſame cauſe, which would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a hail ſtone of the bigneſs of a gooſe egg would not produce one of a pound or eight pounds weight, provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cauſe was increaſed in proportion to the effect.</p>
            <p>I will now turn to modern hiſtory. Arthur Young, a very credible Author, who travelled through France, in the years 1707, 1788, and 1789, in order to make obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:035405_0018_1004BA2626844A60"/>on the climate, and gain a knowledge of agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, after ſpeaking of the climate, in the Province of Touraine, Limoſin and Bourbonoiſe, as being the moſt ſalubrious, temperate, and healthful places in the world, ſays they ſuffer very much from ſevere ſtorms of rain and hail.</p>
            <p>"Two years ago one violent ſtorm of hail ſwept a track of deſolation, in a belt acroſs the whole Kingdom, to the damage of ſeveral millions ſterling. Such extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ruin is not common, for if it were, the fineſt Kingdoms would be laid waſte; but no year paſſes without whole pariſhes ſuffering, to a degree of which we have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and to the amount of no inconſiderable propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole produce of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>"It appears, from my friend Dr. Symonds's paper on the climate of Italy, that the miſchief of hail is dreadful to the utmoſt. I have heard it calculated in the South of France, that the damage in ſome Provinces amounted to one tenth part of the whole produce of them, on an av<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erage. A few days before my arrival at Barbeſieux, there had fallen at the Duke de la Rochefoucault's ſeat in the Agoumoiſe, and ſome neighbouring pariſhes, a ſhower of hail, that did not leave a ſingle grape on the vines, and cut them ſo ſeverely as to preclude all hope of a crop the year following, and allowed no well founded expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of any beneficial produce, even the third year. In another place geeſe were killed, by the ſame ſtorm; young colts were ſo much wounded that they died after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. It is even aſſerted, that men were killed by it, when unable to obtain any ſhelter. This ſtorm deſtroyed a copſe of the duke's that were of two years' growth, with ſuch effects it muſt be obvious to every one, that all ſorts of corn and pulſe muſt be deſtroyed." This ſtorm happened in the ſummer of 1787.—<hi>Arthur Young's Travels, vol.</hi> II.</p>
            <p>The provinces, which I have mentioned, lie near the Pyrennean mountains, between France and Italy.</p>
            <p>I will now mention one of a later date. In Auguſt 1792, there was a moſt violent tornado and hurricane in the ſtate of Vermont, which ended in a hail ſtorm. This ſtorm began near Lake Champlain, on Onion river, and took its courſe ſouth, till it met what is called the Hog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backs, which are high lands on the north of ſaid river.—This mountain parted the cloud; part of it went to the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:035405_0019_1004BA27CB5F0E78"/>S. W. and loſt itſelf on the highland, the other took a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection about S. E. and increaſed into a violent tornado and hurricane. Where it was confined among the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains it was a proper whirlwind, twiſting off the largeſt trees in the foreſt, in ſome places. Where it was not, it took more of a direct line, and was more like a hurricane. On or near the highlands, the tornado became violent, laying proſtrate every thing before it. Happily this was in the foreſt, where there were no inhabitants. Soon after this, hail ſtones began to fall, which were as large as hen's eggs. This ſtorm continued fifteen or twenty miles, ſcattering its icy contents on the towns of Thetford, Lyme, and many other places. The hail ſtones were rough, like thoſe which I have mentioned. This ſtorm was more than 100 miles in length, but abated ſoon after the hail began to fall; when it came into a more open country. This cloud appeared very black, and the roar was inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant. I was not in the ſtorm, but was on a viſit near the place, weere I could view the cloud and hear the roar of it, and had the above information from gentlemen, on whoſe veracity I could rely.</p>
            <p>From the foregoing obſervations, we ſee that thoſe who have been viſited with the late ſtorm are not the only people, who have been doomed to ſee their fields deſolat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſame elements, which ſerve to make them fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, when kept in perfect uniſon with each other.</p>
            <p>Tornado at Bozrah, on the 2d of Auguſt, 1799.</p>
            <p>Friday morning, Auguſt 2d, the day was uſhered in with a thick clouded atmoſphere, which about 10 o'clock A. M. aſſumed an appearance, as if pregnant with ſcenes of diſtreſs, like thoſe which happened a few days ſince, and very much alarmed thoſe, who were ſpectators of it. The clouds ſeemed in confuſion, and ruſhed to the N. E. The lightning was extremely ſharp, and inſtantly follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with heavy thunder; peal anſwered to peal, which kept vibrating in our ears for ſome time, attended with heavy rain, and a few ſmall hail ſtones fell, of the ſize of hail in winter. After the ſtorm, I heard there had been a tornado about three miles diſtant I went and viewed it, and obtained as accurate information as I could, from a number of gentlemen, who were men of information.—It was firſt diſcovered on the Great Pond (alias) Gardner's Pond, which is in the S. W. part of the town of Bozrah, and took its courſe from S. W. to N. E. and followed
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:035405_0020_1004BA29A3A03570"/>the brook, which runs out of the pond, and is called the pond brook; after it had paſſed about three fourths of a mile it became violent, laying proſtrate almoſt every thing before it, for three miles and a half, when it went into a heavy grove of wood, at the mouth of the brook, where it empties into Deep river. This grove ſeemed to break it, ſo that it did no damage more than 100 or 150 rods to the eaſtward of it. It began about three fourths of a mile farther eaſt than the hail ſtorm, and left a ſpace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched by either of that width, where they ran parallel with each other. In its width, it was from 60 to 140 rods. The pond on which it began, is ſurrounded by a country which gradually riſes on every ſide, except to the N. E; where the pond brook has its ſource. The water of the pond is quite warm; conſidering the bigneſs of it, which is three miles in length, and about one and a half in breadth. The brook, like all others, is covered on both ſides by riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ground.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not undertake to philoſophize on this, but leave it for a more able pen. I ſhall now mention the effects of it. It paſſed through the centre of the town, which is a beautiful, fertile country, and laid waſte ſome of the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt orchards in the country; the trees lay in every direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I was informed that there were more than ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred apple trees blown down, and the ſturdy oak had to yield in its turn. Many buildings were damaged, and ſome almoſt entirely demoliſhed. Mr. Jabez Hough, had one barn unroofed, Mr. Jabez Hough, jun. two barns blown down, and his houſe partly unroofed. Mr. Ebenezer Hough's houſe blown to pieces. Capt. Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall's barn unroofed, and houſe injured; ſome of the ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles and clapboards were carried ſeveral miles. The greateſt damage was their orchards.</p>
            <p>The wonderful diſplays of Omnipotent power and goodneſs to mankind have formed, and been the ſubject of moſt of the books which have been written for the ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efit of them. In vain have many eminent Divines faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully laboured in the vineyard of their Maſter, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the world of their entire dependence on him, who made man, to reverence and obey his Creator. I ſay ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have laboured in vain, becauſe man is not convinced of this truth; that the Almighty diſpenſes his judgments with an equal hand, and diſpoſes of events as he chooſes, and giveth not an account of his matters. He ſaith of
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:035405_0021_1004BA2EA6DDBCD0"/>Pharaoh, "And in very deed, for this cauſe have I raiſed thee up, to ſhew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth." From this, it is evident that theſe things are ſent to us, creatures, to make us ſenſible of our dependance on the former and faſhioner of our mortal bodies. It appears that GOD had uſed means to reclaim the Egpytians from their idolatrous and wicked practices, by ſending them a variety of the moſt diſtreſſing judgments that had ever been ſent on the world of mankind; ſtill ſending them greater and heavier judgments, and the Egyptians increaſing in wickedneſs, not feeling any gratitude to their GOD for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their lives in the midſt of ſuch dangers. It is true they would ſeem to repent, while they thirſted for water, or were covered with ſores, and their kneading troughs filled with filthy vermine and reptiles; but no ſooner were they removed, than they returned to their old courſe of wickedneſs, and forgot their former trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, for which reaſon GOD ſpake unto them by Moſes, ſaying; "For now I will ſtretch out my hand, that I may ſmite thee and thy people with peſtilence; and thou ſhalt be cut off from the earth. Behold, to morrow about this time, I will cauſe it to rain a very grievous hail, ſuch as hath not been in Egypt ſince the foundation thereof, even until now."</p>
            <p>Judgments of all kinds, ſhew us the abſolute omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Deity; yet man is a being poſſeſſed of a variety of ſenſes, which ſerve to convey ideas to his mind, and conſequently thoſe ideas make the moſt laſting impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which fall with the greateſt weight on his internal ſenſes, and it ſeems nothing could fall with a greater weight on the ſenſes of the Egyptians than hail, lightning and thunder. For thoſe who never ſaw ſo much as a ſhower of rain fall on the earth, to ſee the air filled with ſolid ſubſtances, that killed and brake every thing on which it fell, and ſtreams of livid fire running on the ground like ſerpents, and were uſhered in with the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental voice of thunder, which was a new and dreadful ſound to the Egyptians. What could appear with more ſolemn pomp, and awful majeſty than this! The giving of the law at Mount Sinai, was not attended with more diſplays of omnipotence than the plagues of Egypt.</p>
            <p>It is true it requires the ſame omnipotent power to produce a ſpire of graſs, that it does to remove a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:035405_0022_1004BA303303FB78"/>or to bring into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

               </gap> and fill their minds with as much awe and reverence, as any that could be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on them. We find that the moſt ſtrong figures of GOD's awful judgments on the world, are repreſented by great hail ſtones, fire and brimſtone. Notwithſtanding all this, the Egyptians became hardened under their afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which is a ſtanding monument of the depravity of human nature.</p>
            <p>On taking a curſory view of the ſubject, we are apt to ſay, what wicked and idolatrous ſet of men, that ſhould ſo long abuſe and oppreſs the people of GOD, when they ſaw his immediate hand executing his judgments upon them for their wickedneſs; but what is our ſurprize, when we come to a view of the conduct of the people, who were favoured with as many ſignal bleſſings, for whom GOD wrought all theſe miracles—dividing the Red Sea for them—directing them by day and night—making a covenant with them in the moſt ſolemn manner. This was a moſt ſolemn covenant; the preliminaries were drawn up, and then read in the hearing of all the people. They conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it: then Moſes took the blood of the ſacrifice and ſprinkled it on the people and on the book, thereby ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in the moſt ſolemn manner. After all this, no ſooner was Moſes abſent a longer time than uſual, than they went and made a calf—worſhipped it: and even the high prieſt himſelf had the wickedneſs to go and make this image, in order that the people might worſhip it.</p>
            <p>Aſtoniſhing ſtupidity! This was ſo ſcandalous a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, that Joſephus (being aſhamed of it in his nation) has left it out of his hiſtory. Now, which of the two was guilty of the greateſt ſtupidity and wickedneſs; the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians, or the children of Iſrael? In the preſent caſe, let us examine ourſelves—is not our land corrupted? has not vice become faſhionable among us? are not our hearts corrupted? have we not got an idol ſet up in them as much as the children of Iſrael or the Egyptians had? have we not ſomething beſide the mercy of GOD, and merits of Jeſus Chriſt, by which we mean to be ſaved? Let us examine ourſelves, and ſee if we offer a pure ſacrifice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the altar? are we not more fond of being thought ſtrict
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:035405_0023_1004BA31EB1E2D70"/>obſerver of external duties, than we are of being friendly to thoſe who are in diſtreſs, thereby making our fellow men more happy? What does the Saviour of mankind ſay in this reſpect? I was hungry and ye gave me no meat, thirſty, and ye gave me no drink, naked, and ye cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me not. They ſaid unto him, when ſaw we thee hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry or thirſty, and did not adminiſter unto thee. He ſaid, in as much as ye have not done it unto theſe, ye have not done it unto me? If we cannot feed the hungry, clothe the naked, viſit the ſick, &amp;c. if we cannot do this, how can we aſk it of him who gives us all things, or are we better than our neighbours? Where is the man who can ſtand forth and ſay to his GOD, I am better than my neighbour? Let not this Phariſaic diſpoſition ariſe in our hearts and ſay, were thoſe eighteen Gallileans on whom the tower Siloam has fallen—are they ſinners above all others? I tell you nay! Except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh. To ſay this is ingratitude, is a ſin which I think is predominant in the land at the preſent day.</p>
            <p>Love and charity are wanting, both toward GOD and man. If ye have faith to remove mountains, and have not charity ye are nothing, ſaith the apoſtle. Charity is the bond of perfection. We may practiſe all the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal duties in religion, and yet be void of any love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward GOD, or our neighbour—theſe are duties which will not coſt any thing. When the bleſſed Jeſus ſaid to the young man, ſell what thou haſt and give to the poor, then come and follow me, we find that he went away ſorrowful, for he had great poſſeſſions. He had every thing but charity. Except we have charity we cannot be the diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt. Had Chriſtians more benevolence, charity and kindneſs towards each other, it would be well. I have no doubt but Chriſtianity would have been more univerſally believed than it is, had it not been for the Chriſtian nations treating each other as they have done. There was a counſel of the moſt learned Jews held about one hundred and fifty years ſince. When each one had produced the record of his family and took his ſeat in the council, the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were read. Then each one brought forward his candidate to be acknowledged as the Meſſiah. The firſt thing was an examination into their moral characters, and their appearance in the world. A number had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:035405_0024_1004BA355DC9DAC0"/>and it was found, their morals were in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree corrupted. At length the Romiſh church brought for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Jeſus Chriſt as their candidate, and on examination they conſented that he might be the Meſſiah, but they ſaid, where are his followers? and on examining into the behaviour of the church of Rome, and finding what cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty they had uſed toward other nations, and what wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs was practiſed by thoſe nations who profeſſed this religion; they ſaid, ſurely this cannot be the Meſſiah—and the council broke up, after determining for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that the Meſſiah had not come. "Love is made for a law of the moral world as gravitation is of the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial world, and would be as uniformly obeyed, was it not for the Moral agency of man." The preſent ſtorm af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords an opportunity of trying charity and putting of it to the teſt. When objects of charity preſent themſelves, we are apt to ſay they are indolent, idle vagabonds, or they might be as well off as I am, if by fire or ſickneſs, they are diſtreſſed and apply for relief—we ſay I have opportunities enough to give away what I have, without giving of it to a ſtranger; let his neighbours do for him; now his neighbours ſay, I have helped him enough be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let people at large do for him; ſo the poor object is thrown from his neighbour to the ſtranger, and from the ſtranger to his neighbour. Again, and he might look for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na from Heaven as ſoon as charity from people of ſuch a diſpoſition? How many are found among us of this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of mind. In the preſent caſe, all excuſes are taken off. Here are objects enough to afford you all an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of beſtowing your charity. Here are many who by dint of induſtry have lived and ſupported their families, and now unleſs aſſiſtance is afforded them, they muſt ſell their lands and eat it up to ſupport them till another harveſt is ready, and when that comes they have neither land nor harveſt. Here are others who have more land than enough to ſupport them, to remedy the worſt of evils, that of coming to poverty, they muſt ſell their lands and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire into the wilderneſs with the little remains of fortune, where they can obtain land enough to ſupport themſelves. They muſt now leave their friends and acquaintance, which is more trying than even death itſelf. Deprive man of a friend and in regard to happineſs he is below the loweſt of the brutal creation. Perhaps my reader may think I am ſome way intereſted in the benevolence of the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:035405_0025_1004BA39705B74A0"/>public towards the ſufferers? But I am not, in any other way, than I ſee my fellow men diſtreſſed, for I am not a ſufferer by it. Where is the man who would not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſpare one dollar out of an hundred, rather than ſee any of his fellow men reduced to this neceſſity, by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable misfortune, to which we are equally expoſed. Now let the man whoſe heart glows with gratitude for the rich bleſſings of an abundant harveſt ſay what is the ſituation of my brother? his fields are like a barren deſert, his cattle are without hay, his wife and children are without bread? Shall my heart exult in this idea, while my brother is in want of ſuperabundant goods of fortune which I have received from the ſame common parent? Have I not ſomething which I can ſpare without injury to myſelf or family? Let no one ſay I pity them and withhold his hand, or ſay, I would ſend them a buſhel of grain if I could, but let him aſk his neighbour if he does not wiſh to help them. If you do, I will preſume to ſay you will find generous hearted men in every town who will be willing to help make up a load for a horſe or ſleigh. I fear the diſtreſs of the poor will be very great before another har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt is produced; but from the kindneſs and liberality of their neighbours. I flatter myſelf they will be helped from a generous public, and if any gentleman ſhould be ſo inclined who lives at a diſtance, I would recommend Meſſrs. William Huntington, jun. John Howard and Benjamin B. Fitch, as men with whom they may depoſit any thing, and depend that it will be properly diſtribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among the ſufferers.</p>
            <p>It ſeems GOD has given to ſome and taken it from oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, thereby making us his Stewards for each other, and how happy muſt it be for the noble to receive the grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful look of the receiver. Whilſt his heart glows with gratitude to the giver, give therefore and let the hearts of the giver and receiver rejoice together.</p>
            <p>Let it not be ſaid of America as of Poland, that love and Charity are only known by name.</p>
