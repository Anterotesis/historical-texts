            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For ſome of us moved with fear, ſet apart a day of <hi>prayer,</hi> to aſk of GOD either to ſpare, and ſave us from the hands of our enemies, or to prepare us to ſanctify and honor him, in what way ſoever he ſhould come forth towards us. The places of ſcripture from whence we were entertained in the forenoon, were <hi>Gen.</hi> xxxii. 10, 11: <hi>I am not worthy of the leaſt of all the mercies, and of all the truth which thou haſt ſhewed unto thy ſervant:—

And it is very obſervable, how GOD ordered our prayers in a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar manner, to be going up to him; to prepare us with a right <hi>chriſtian ſpirit,</hi> to undergo, and endure ſuffering trials.</p>
                  <p>Not long after, the holy and righteous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> GOD brought us under great trials, as to our perſons and families, which put us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a neceſſity of ſpreading before him in a wilderneſs, the diſtreſſing dangers and calamities of our relations, yea, that call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on us notwithſtanding ſeeming preſent frowns, to reſolve by his grace, not to be ſent away without a bleſſing. <hi>Jacob</hi> in wreſtling has the hollow of his thigh put out of joint, and it is ſaid to him, <hi>Let me

go:</hi> Yet he is rather animated to a heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal chriſtian reſolution to continue earneſt for the bleſſing, than diſcouraged from aſking.</p>
                  <p>ON <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 29<hi>th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> 1703-4, not long before break of day, the enemy came in like a flood upon us; our watch being unfaithful: An evil, the aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful effects of which, in the ſurpriſal of our fort, ſhould beſpeak all watchmen to avoid, as they would not bring the charge of blood upon themſelves. They came to my houſe in the beginning of the onſet, and by their violent endeavours to break open doors and windows, with <hi>axes</hi> and <hi>hatchets,</hi> awaked me out of ſleep; on which I leaped out of bed, and running towards the door, perceived the enemy making their entrance into the houſe; I called to awaken two ſoldiers in the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and returning toward my bed-ſide for my arm, the enemy immediately broke into the room, I judge, to the number of twenty, with <hi>painted faces,</hi> and hideous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations. I reached up my hands to the bed teſter for my piſtol, uttering a ſhort petition to GOD, <hi>for everlaſting mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies for me and mine, on the account of the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:039104_0008_1013C2161323A880"/>
merits of our glorified Redeemer;</hi> expecting a preſent paſſage through the velley of the ſhadow of death; ſaving in myſelf, as <hi>Iſai.</hi> xxxviii. 10, 11. <hi>I ſaid, in the cutting off my days, I ſhall go to the gates of the grave: I am deprived of the reſidue of my years. I ſaid, I ſhall not ſee the Lord, even the Lord, in the land of the living; I ſhall behold man no more, with the inhabitants of the world.</hi> Taking down my piſtol, I cocked it, and put it to the breaſt of the firſt Indian that came up; but my piſtol miſſing fire, I was ſeized by three Indians, who diſarmed me, and bound me naked, as I was in my ſhirt, and ſo I ſtood for near the ſpace of an hour: Binding me, they told me they would carry me to <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck.</hi> My Piſtol miſſing fire, was an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of my life's being preſerved; ſince which I have alſo found it profitable to be croſſed in my own will. The judgment of GOD did not long ſlumber againſt one of the three which took me, who was a captain, for by ſun riſing he received a mortal ſhot from my next neighbor's houſe; who oppoſed ſo great a number of <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> as <hi>three hundred,</hi> and yet were no more than <hi>ſeven</hi> men in an ungarriſoned houſe.</p>

I cannot relate the diſtreſſing care I had for my dear wife, who had lain in but a few weeks before; and for my poor chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, family, and chriſtian neighbours. The enemy fell to rifling the houſe, and entered in great numbers into every room of the houſe. I begged of GOD, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member mercy in the midſt of judgment, That he would ſo far reſtrain their wrath, as to prevent their murdering of us: That we might have <hi>grace to glorify his name, whether in life or death;</hi> and as I was able, committed our ſtate to GOD. The ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies who entered the houſe, were all of them <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Macquas,</hi> inſulted over me awhile, holding up hatchets over my head, threatening to burn all I had; but yet GOD beyond expectation, made us in a great meaſure to be pitied; for tho' ſome were ſo cruel and barbarous as to take and carry to the door, two of my children and murder them, as alſo a negro woman; yet they gave me liberty to put on my clothes, keeping me bound with a cord on one arm, till I put on my clothes to the other; and then changing my cord, they let me dreſs myſelf, and then pinioned me again. Gave liberty to my dear wife to dreſs herſelf, and our children. About

ſun an hour high, we were all carried out of the houſe, for a march, and ſaw many of the houſes of my neighbors in flames, perceiving the whole fort, one houſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, to be taken. Who can tell what ſorrows pierced our ſouls, when we ſaw ourſelves carried away from GOD'S ſanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, to go into a ſtrange land, expoſed to ſo many trials; the journey being at leaſt <hi>three hundred miles</hi> we were to travel; the ſnow up to the knees, and we never inur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſuch hardſhips and fatigues; the place we were to be carried to, a Popiſh country. Upon my parting from the town, they fired my houſe and barn. We were carried over the river, to the foot of the <hi>mountain,</hi> about a mile from my houſe, where we found a great number of our chriſtian neighbors, men, women, and children, to the number of an <hi>hundred, nineteen</hi> of which were afterward murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the way, and <hi>two</hi> ſtarved to death, near <hi>Cowaſs,</hi> in a time of great ſcarcity or famine, the ſavages underwent there. When we came to the foot of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, they took away our ſhoes, and gave us in the room of them, Indian ſhoes, to prepare us for our travel. Whilſt we were there, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> beat out a company
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:039104_0011_1013C2237B97DFE8"/>
that remained in the town, and purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to the river, killing and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many of them; but the body of the army being alarmed, they repulſed thoſe few <hi>Engliſh</hi> that purſued them.</p>
                  <p>I am not able to give you an account of the number of the enemy, ſlain, but I obſerved after this fight, no great inſulting mirth, as I expected; and ſaw many wounded perſons, and for ſeveral days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, they buried of their party, and one of chief note among the <hi>Macquas.</hi> The governor of <hi>Canada</hi> told me, his army had that ſucceſs with the loſs of but <hi>eleven</hi> men; <hi>three Frenchmen,</hi> one of which was the <hi>lieutenant</hi> of the army, <hi>five Macquas</hi> and <hi>three Indians:</hi> But after my arrival at <hi>Quebeck,</hi> I ſpake with an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> who was taken in the laſt war, and marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there, and of their religion; who told me, they loſt <hi>above forty,</hi> and that many were wounded: I replied, the governor of <hi>Canada</hi> ſaid, they loſt but <hi>eleven</hi> men: He anſwered, 'tis true, that there were but <hi>eleven</hi> killed outright at the taking of the fort, but that many others were wounded, among whom was the <hi>enſign</hi> of the <hi>French;</hi> but ſaid he, they had a ſight in the mead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ow, and that in both engagements, they
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:039104_0012_1013C226D7C49070"/>
loſt <hi>more than forty.</hi> Some of the ſoldiers, both <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> then preſent, told me ſo, (ſaid he,) adding, that the <hi>French</hi> always endeavour to conceal the number of their ſlain.</p>
                  <p>After this, we went up the mountain, and ſaw the ſmoke of the fires in the town, and beheld the awful deſolations of Deer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field: And before we marched any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they killed a ſucking child of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> There were ſlain by the enemy of the inhabitants of Deerfield, to the number of <hi>thirty eight,</hi> beſides <hi>nine</hi> of the neighboring towns. We travelled not far the <hi>firſt day;</hi> God made the heathen ſo to pity our children, that though they had ſeveral wounded perſons of their own to carry upon their ſhoulders, for <hi>thirty miles,</hi> before they came to the river, yet they carried our children, incapable of travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, in their arms, and upon their ſhoulders. When we came to our lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place, the <hi>firſt night,</hi> they dug away the ſnow, and made ſome wigwams, cut down ſome ſmall branches of the <hi>ſpruce tree</hi> to lie down on, and gave the priſoners ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to eat; but we had but little appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite. I was pinioned, and bound down that night, and ſo I was every night whilſt
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:039104_0013_1013C22C2FA9EF50"/>
I was with the army. Some of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my who brought drink with them from the town, fell to drinking, and in their drunken fit, they killed my negro man, the only dead perſon I either ſaw at the town, or in the way.</p>
                  <p>In the night an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> made his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape; in the morning [<hi>March</hi> I,] I was called for, and ordered by the general to tell the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that if any more made their eſcape, they would burn the reſt of the priſoners. He that took me, was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to let me ſpeak with any of the priſoners, as we marched; but on the <hi>morning</hi> of the <hi>ſecond day,</hi> he being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to guard the rear, I was put into the hands of my other maſter, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted me to ſpeak to my wife, when I overtook her, and to walk with her to help her in her journey. On the way, we diſcourſed of the happineſs of thoſe who had a right to <hi>an houſe not made with bands, eternal in the heavens;</hi> and <hi>God for a father, and friend;</hi> as alſo, that it was our reaſonable duty, quietly to ſubmit to the will of GOD, and to ſay, <hi>the will of the Lord be done.</hi> My wife told me her ſtrength of body began to fail, and that I muſt expect to part with her; ſaying, ſhe
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:039104_0014_1013C22FF3E86BF0"/>
hoped God would preſerve my life, and the life of ſome, if not of all our children, with us; and commended to me, under God, the care of them. She never ſpake any diſcontented word as to what had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen us, but with ſuitable expreſſions juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified God in what had happened. We ſoon made a halt, in which time my chief ſurviving maſter came up, upon which I was put upon marching with the foremoſt, and ſo made to take my laſt farewell of my dear wife, <hi>the deſire of my eyes,</hi> and companion in many mercies and afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Upon our ſeparation from each other, we aſked for each other, grace ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, for what God ſhould call us to: After our being parted from one another, ſhe ſpent the few remaining minutes of her ſtay, in reading the holy ſcriptures; which ſhe was wont perſonally every day to delight her ſoul in reading, praying, meditating on, and over, by herſelf, in her cloſet, over and above what ſhe heard out of them in our family worſhip. I was made to wade over a ſmall river, and ſo were all the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the water above knee deep, the ſtream very ſwift; and after that to travel up a ſmall mountain; my ſtrength was almoſt ſpent, before I
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:039104_0015_1013C2334CC800D0"/>
came to the top of it: No ſooner had I overcome the difficulty of that aſcent, but I was permitted to ſit down, and be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthened of my pack; I ſat pitying thoſe who were behind, and intreated my maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to let me go down and help my wife; but he refuſed and would not let me ſtir from him. I aſked each of the priſoners (as they paſſed by me) after her, and heard that paſſing through the aboveſaid river, ſhe fell down, and was plunged over head and ears in the water; after which ſhe travelled not far, for at the foot of that mountain, the cruel and bloodthirſty ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age who took her, ſlew her with his hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et at one ſtroke, the tidings of which were very awful: And yet ſuch was the hard-heartedneſs of the adverſary, that my tears were reckoned to me as a reproach. My loſs, and the loſs of my children was great, our hearts were ſo filled with ſorrow, that nothing but the comfortable hopes of her being taken away in mercy, to herſelf, from the evils we were to ſee, feel, and ſuffer under, (and joined to the aſſembly of the <hi>ſpirits of juſt men made perfect,</hi> to reſt in peace, and <hi>joy unſpeakable and full of glory;</hi> and the good pleaſure of God thus to exerciſe us) could have kept us
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:039104_0016_1013C234D4CDAF00"/>
from ſinking under, at that time. That ſcripture, <hi>Job</hi> i. 21. <hi>Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked ſhall I return thither: The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away, bleſſed be the name of the Lord,</hi> was brought to my mind, and from it, that an <hi>afflicting God was to be glorified;</hi> with ſome other places of ſcripture, to perſuade to a patient bearing my afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>We were again called upon to march, with a far heavier <hi>burden on my ſpirits,</hi> than on my <hi>back.</hi> I begged of God to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule in his providence, that the corpſe of one ſo dear to me, and of one whoſe ſpirit he had taken to dwell with him in glory, might meet with a chriſtian burial, and not be left for meat to the fowls of the air, and beaſts of the earth: A mercy that God graciouſly vouchſafed to grant. For God put it into the hearts of my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, to come out as far as ſhe lay, to take up her corpſe, carry it to the town, and decently to bury it ſoon after. In our march they killed a ſucking infant of one of my neighbors; and before night a <hi>girl</hi> of about <hi>eleven</hi> years of age. I was made to mourn, at the conſideration of my flock's being ſo far a flock of ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:039104_0017_1013C239EEE4E9D0"/>
many being ſlain in the town, and ſo many murdered in ſo few miles from the town; and from fears what we muſt yet expect, from ſuch who delightfully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brued their hands in the blood of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his people. When we came to our lodging place, an Indian captain from the <hi>eaſtward,</hi> ſpake to my maſter about kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, and taking off my ſcalp. I lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up my heart to God, to implore his grace and mercy in ſuch a time of need; and afterwards I told my maſter, if he intended to kill me, I deſired he would let me know of it; aſſuring him that my death, after a promiſe of quarter, would bring the guilt of blood upon him. He told me he would not kill me: We laid down and ſlept, for God ſuſtained and kept us.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>morning [March 2.]</hi> we were all called before the chief <hi>Sachems</hi> of the <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quas</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> that a more equal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution might be made of the priſoners, among them: At my going from the <hi>wigwam,</hi> my beſt cloathing was taken from me. As I came nigh the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, ſome of the captives met me, and told me, they thought the enemies were going to burn ſome of us, for they
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:039104_0018_1013C23CF275E090"/>
had peeled off the bark from ſeveral trees, and acted very ſtrangely. To whom I replied, They could act nothing againſt us, but as they were permitted of God, and I was perſuaded he would prevent ſuch ſeverities. When we came to the <hi>wigwam</hi> appointed, ſeveral of the captives were taken from their former maſters, and put into the hands of others; but I was ſent again to my two maſters who brought me from my houſe.</p>
                  <p>In our <hi>fourth day's march, [Friday, March</hi> 3,] the enemy killed another of my neighbors, who being near the time of travail, was wearied with her journey. When we came to the great river, the enemy took <hi>ſleighs</hi> to draw their wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſeveral of our children, and their packs, and marched a great pace. I travelled many hours in water up to the ankles: Near night I was very lame, having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my travel wrenched my ankle bone and ſinews: I thought, and ſo did others, that I ſhould not be able to hold out to travel far. I lifted up my heart to God, my only refuge, to remove my lameneſs, and carry me through, with my children and neighbors if he judged it beſt; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I deſired God would be with me in
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:039104_0019_1013BE8FC01B63B8"/>
my great change, if he called me by ſuch a death to glorify him; and that he would take care of my children, and neighbors, and bleſs them; and within a little ſpace of time I was well of my lameneſs, to the joy of my friends, who ſaw ſo great an alteration in my travelling.</p>
                  <p>On <hi>Saturday, [March</hi> 4,] the journey was long and tedious; we travelled with ſuch ſpeed that four women were tired, and then ſlain by them who led them captive.</p>
                  <p>On the <hi>Sabbath day, [March</hi> 5,] we reſted, and I was permitted to pray, and preach to the captives. The place of ſcripture ſpoken from, was <hi>Lam.</hi> i. 18. <hi>The Lord is righteous, for I have rebelled againſt his commandment: Hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my ſorrow: my vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins and my young men are gone into captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> The enemy who ſaid to us, <hi>Sing us one of Zion's ſongs,</hi> were ready, ſome of them, to upbraid us, becauſe our ſinging was not ſo loud as theirs. <hi>When the</hi> Macquas <hi>and</hi> Indians <hi>were chief in power, we had this revival in our bondage, to join together in the worſhip of God,</hi> and encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age one another to a patient <hi>bearing the indignation of the Lord, till he ſhould plead
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:039104_0020_1013C245865A6F30"/>
our cauſe.</hi> When we <hi>arrived at</hi> New France, <hi>we were forbidden praying one with another, or joining together in the ſervice of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>next day, [Monday, March </hi> 6,] ſoon after we marched, we had an alarm; on which many of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were bound: I was then near the front, and my maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not with me, ſo I was not bound. This alarm was occaſioned by ſome <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> ſhooting at geeſe that flew over them, which put them into a conſiderable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation and fright: But after they came to underſtand that they were not purſued by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they boaſted, That they would not come out after them, as they had boaſted before we began our journey in the morning. They killed this day two women, who were ſo ſaint they could not travel.</p>
                  <p>The next day, [<hi>Tueſday, March</hi> 7,] in the morning, before we travelled, one <hi>Mary Brooks,</hi> a pious young woman, came to the <hi>wigwam</hi> where I was, and told me, ſhe deſired to bleſs God, who had inclined the heart of her maſter, to let her come and take her farewel of me. Said ſhe, by my falls on the ice yeſterday, I injured myſelf, cauſing a miſcarriage this night,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:039104_0021_1013C2470DE16010"/>
ſo that I am not able to travel far; I know they will kill me to day: But (ſays ſhe) God has (praiſed be his name) by his ſpirit with his word, ſtrengthened me to my laſt encounter with death; and ſo mentioned to me ſome places of <hi>ſcripture</hi> ſeaſonably ſent in for her ſupport. And (ſays ſhe) <hi>I am not afraid of death:</hi> I can, through the grace of God, chearfully ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to his will. Pray for me (ſaid ſhe) at parting, that God would take me to himſelf. Accordingly ſhe was killed that day. I mention it to the end, I may ſtir up all in their young days, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the death of Chriſt by faith, to a giving them an holy boldneſs in the day of death.</p>
                  <p>The next day, [<hi>Wedneſday, March</hi> 8,] we were made to ſcatter one from anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er into ſmaller companies; and one of my children was carried away with <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> belonging to the <hi>eaſtern</hi> parts. At night my maſter came to me, with my piſtol in his hand, and put it to my breaſt, and ſaid, now I will kill you, for (he ſaid) you would have killed me with it if you could. But by the grace of God, I was not much daunted, and whatever his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention might be God prevented my death.</p>
                  <p>

The <hi>next day, [Thurſday, March</hi> 9,] I was again permitted to <hi>pray</hi> with that company of captives with me, and we were allowed to <hi>ſing a pſalm</hi> together. After which, I was taken from all the company of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> excepting <hi>two children</hi> of my neighbors, one of which a <hi>girl of four years of age,</hi> was killed by her <hi>Macqua</hi> maſter <hi>the next morning, [Friday, March</hi> 10,] the ſnow being ſo deep when we left the river, that he could not carry the child and his pack too.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Sabbath</hi> came, [<hi>March</hi> 12,] one <hi>Indian</hi> ſtaid with me, and a little <hi>boy, nine years old,</hi> while the reſt went a hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And when I was here, I thought with myſelf, that God had now ſeparated me from the congregation of his people, who were <hi>now</hi> in his <hi>ſanctuary,</hi> where he commandeth the <hi>bleſſing, even life forever:</hi> And made to bewail my <hi>unfruitfulneſs</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and <hi>unthankfulneſs</hi> for ſuch a mercy. When my ſpirit was almoſt overwhelmed within me, at the conſideration of what had paſſed over me, and what was to be expected; I was almoſt ready to ſink un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it: But God ſpake thoſe words with a greater efficacy than man could ſpeak them, for my ſtrengthening and ſupport.

And though they ſuffered very much through ſcarcity of food, and tedious journeys, they were carried through to <hi>Montreal.</hi> And my ſon <hi>Stephen</hi> about <hi>eleven years of age,</hi> wonderfully preſerved from death, in the famine whereof <hi>three Engliſh</hi> perſons died, and after <hi>eight months</hi> brought into <hi>Shamblee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My maſter returned on the evening of the <hi>ſabbath, [March</hi> 12,] and told me, <hi>he had killed five Mooſe.</hi> The next day, <hi>[Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:039104_0025_1013C25272DA8E00"/>
March</hi> 13,] we were removed to the place where he killed them. We tarried there <hi>three days</hi> till we had roaſted and dried the meat. My maſter made me a pair of ſnowſhoes for (ſaid he) <hi>you cannot poſſibly travel without;</hi> the ſnow being knee deep. We parted from thence heavy laden; I travelled with a burden on my back, with ſnowſhoes, twenty five miles <hi>the firſt day</hi> of wearing them; and again the <hi>next day</hi> till afternoon; and then we came to the <hi>French river.</hi> My maſter at this place took away my pack, and drew the whole load on the ice; but my bones ſeemed to be miſplaced, and I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to travel with any ſpeed. My feet were very ſore, and each night I wrung <hi>blood</hi> out of my <hi>ſtockings,</hi> when I pulled them off. My <hi>ſhins</hi> alſo were very ſore, being cut with cruſty ſnow, in time of my travelling without <hi>ſnowſhoes.</hi> But finding ſome dry <hi>oak leaves,</hi> by the river banks, I put them to my <hi>ſhins,</hi> and in once apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, they were healed. And here my maſter was very kind to me, would always give me the beſt he had to eat; and by the goodneſs of God, I never want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a <hi>meal's meat</hi> during my captivity; though ſome of my children and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:039104_0026_1013C256203E8FF8"/>
were greatly wounded, (as I may ſay) with the arrows of <hi>famine</hi> and <hi>pinching want;</hi> having for many days nothing but <hi>roots</hi> to live upon, and not much of them neither. My maſter gave me a peace of a bible; never diſturbed me in reading the <hi>ſcriptures,</hi> or in <hi>praying</hi> to God. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of my neighbors alſo, found that mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in their journey, to have <hi>bibles, pſalm books, catechiſms,</hi> and <hi>good books,</hi> put into their hands, with <hi>liberty to uſe them;</hi> and yet <hi>after their arrival at</hi> Canada, <hi>all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble endeavors were uſed, to deprive them of them.</hi> Some of them ſay, their <hi>bibles</hi> were <hi>demanded</hi> by the <hi>French prieſts,</hi> and <hi>never redelivered to them, to their great grief and ſorrow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My march on the <hi>French river</hi> was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſore, for rearing a thaw, we travelled a very great pace; my feet were ſo bruiſed, and my joints ſo diſtorted by my travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in ſnowſhoes, that I thought it impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to hold out. <hi>One morning</hi> a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore break of day, my maſter came and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked me out of ſleep, ſaying, <hi>ariſe, pray to God, and eat your breakfaſt, for we muſt go a great way to day.</hi> After prayer, I aroſe from my knees, but my feet were ſo <hi>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſwoln, bruiſed,</hi> and full of <hi>pain,</hi> that I
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:039104_0027_1013C25B310DB570"/>
could ſcarce ſtand upon them, without holding by the <hi>wigwam.</hi> And when the <hi>Indians</hi> ſaid, <hi>you muſt run today,</hi> I anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I could not run; my maſter pointed out his hatchet, ſaid to me, <hi>then I muſt daſh out your brains, and take off your ſcalp.</hi> I ſaid, I ſuppoſe then you will do ſo, for I am not able to travel with ſpeed. He ſent me away alone, on the ice. About ſun half an hour high, he overtook me, for I had gone very ſlowly, not thinking it poſſible to travel five miles. When he came up, he called me to <hi>run;</hi> I told him I could go no faſter; he paſſed by without ſaying one word more: So that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I ſcarce ſaw any thing of him for an hour together. I travelled from about break of day, till dark, never ſo much as ſat down at noon to eat warm victuals; eating frozen meat, which I had in my coat pocket, as I travelled. We went that day <hi>two</hi> of <hi>their days journey,</hi> as they came down. I judge we went <hi>forty</hi> or <hi>forty five miles</hi> that day. God wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupported me, and ſo far renewed my ſtrength, that in the afternoon I was ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to travel than in the forenoon. My ſtrength was reſtored and renewed to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. We ſhould never diſtruſt the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:039104_0028_1013C25E9A0E2A80"/>
care and compaſſion of God, who can give <hi>ſtrength to them who have no might, and power to them who are ready to faint.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When we entered on the lake, the ice was rough, and uneven, which was very grievous to my feet, that could ſcarce bear to be ſet down on the ſmooth ice, on the river; I lifted up my cry to God in ejac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulatory requeſts, <hi>that he would take notice of my ſtate, and ſome way or other relieve me.</hi> I had not marched above half a mile, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there fell a moiſt ſnow, about an inch and an half deep, that made it very ſoft for my feet to paſs over the <hi>lake,</hi> to the place where my maſter's family was. Wonderful favors in the midſt of trying afflictions! We went a <hi>day's journey</hi> from the <hi>lake,</hi> to a ſmall company of <hi>Indians,</hi> who were a hunting; they were, after their manner, kind to me, and gave me the beſt they had, which was <hi>Mooſe fleſh, ground nuts,</hi> and <hi>cramberries,</hi> but no bread: For three weeks together I eat no bread. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our ſtay there, and undergoing difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in cutting wood, and ſuffering by <hi>lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,</hi> having <hi>louſy</hi> old clothes of ſoldiers put upon me when they ſtript me of mine, to ſell to the <hi>French</hi> ſoldiers in the army, we again began a march for <hi>Shamblee;</hi> we
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:039104_0029_1013C2B579B7A280"/>
ſtayed at a branch of the <hi>lake,</hi> and feaſted two or three days on geeſe we killed there. After <hi>another day's travel,</hi> we came to a river where the ice was thawed, we made a <hi>canoe</hi> of <hi>elm bark,</hi> in one day; and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived on a <hi>Saturday</hi>

                        <hi>Suppoſe March</hi> 25.</note> near noon at <hi>Sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blee,</hi> a ſmall village, where is a garriſon and fort of <hi>French</hi> ſoldiers.</p>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>AT SHAMBLEE.</head>
                     <p>This village is about <hi>fifteen miles</hi> from <hi>Montreal.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> were very kind to me: A gentleman of the place, took me into his houſe, and to his table; and lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me at night on a good <hi>feather bed.</hi> The Inhabitants and officers were very oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me, the little time I ſtayed with them, and promiſed to write a letter to the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor in chief, to inform him of my paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the river. Here I ſaw a girl taken from our town, and a young man, who informed me, that the greateſt part of the <hi>captives</hi> were come in, and that two <hi>of my children</hi> were at <hi>Montreal;</hi> that many of the captives had been in, three weeks before my arrival: Mercy in the midſt of judgment! As we paſſed along the river towards <hi>Sorel,</hi> we went into a houſe where was an <hi>Engliſh</hi> woman of our town, who had been left among the <hi>French</hi> in
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:039104_0030_1013C260202C5400"/>
order to her conveyance to the <hi>Indian</hi> fort. The <hi>French</hi> were very kind to her and to myſelf, and gave us the beſt proviſion they had; and ſhe embarked with us to go down to <hi>St. Francois</hi> fort. When we came down to the firſt inhabited houſe at <hi>Sorel,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> woman came to the river ſide, and deſired us to go into her houſe, and when we were entered, ſhe compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned our ſtate, and told us, <hi>ſhe had in the laſt war been a captive among the Indians, and therefore was not a little ſenſible of our difficulties.</hi> She gave the <hi>Indians</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to eat in the <hi>chimney corner,</hi> and ſpread a cloth on the <hi>table</hi> for us with <hi>nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins;</hi> which gave ſuch offence to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> that they haſted away, and would not call in at the fort. But wherever we entered into houſes, the <hi>French</hi> were very courteous. When we came to <hi>St. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cois</hi> river, we found ſome difficulty by reaſon of the ice; and entering into a <hi>Frenchman's</hi> houſe, he gave us a loaf of bread, and ſome fiſh to carry away with us; but we paſſed down the river, till night, and there <hi>ſeven</hi> of us ſupped on a fiſh called <hi>bullhead</hi> or <hi>pout,</hi> and did not eat it up, the fiſh was ſo very large.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>next morning</hi> we met with ſuch a great quantity, of ice, that we were forced
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:039104_0031_1013C2B96C6FABE0"/>
to leave our <hi>canoe,</hi> and travel on land. We went to a <hi>French</hi> officer's houſe, who took us into a private room, out of the ſight of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and treated us very courteouſly. That night we arrived at the fort called <hi>St. Francois;</hi> where we found ſeveral poor children who had been taken from the <hi>eaſtward</hi> the ſummer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; a ſight very affecting, they being in habit very much like <hi>Indians,</hi> and in manners very much ſymbolizing with them. At this fort lived two <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> one of which was made ſuperior of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> at <hi>Quebeck.</hi> One of theſe <hi>Jeſuits</hi> met me at the fort gate, and aſked me to go into the <hi>church</hi> and <hi>give God thanks for preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my life.</hi> I told him I would do that in ſome other place. When the bell rang for evening prayers, he that took me, <hi>bid me go,</hi> but I refuſed: The <hi>Jeſuit</hi> came to our wigwam, and prayed a ſhort prayer; and invited me to ſup with them; and juſtified the <hi>Indians</hi> in what they did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us; rehearſing ſome things done by Major <hi>Walden</hi> above <hi>thirty years ago;</hi> and how juſtly God retaliated them in the laſt war, and enveighed againſt us for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning this war with the <hi>Indians,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>we had before the laſt winter, and in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:039104_0032_1013C2655E58C898"/>
been very barbarous and cruel in burning and killing Indians.</hi> I told them, that the <hi>Indians</hi> in a very perfidious manner, had committed <hi>murders</hi> on many of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, after the ſigning <hi>articles of peace:</hi> And as to what they ſpake of <hi>cruelties,</hi> they were undoubtedly <hi>falſehoods;</hi> for I well knew the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were not approvers of any inhumanity or barbarity towards enemies. They ſaid, <hi>an</hi> Engliſhman <hi>had killed one of St.</hi> Caſteen's <hi>relations, which occaſioned this war:</hi> For, ſay they, <hi>the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in a general council, had concluded not to engage in the war on any ſide, till they themſelves were firſt moleſted, and then all of them as one, would engage againſt them that began a war with them: And that upon the killing of</hi> Caſteen's <hi>kinſman, a poſt was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched to</hi> Canada, <hi>to advertiſe the</hi> Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quas <hi>and</hi> Indians <hi>that the</hi> Engliſh <hi>had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a war. On which they gathered up their forces, and that the</hi> French <hi>joined with them to come down on the</hi> eaſtern parts; <hi>and that when they came near</hi> New-England, <hi>ſeveral of the</hi> eaſtern Indians <hi>told them of the peace made with the</hi> Engliſh, <hi>and the ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfaction given them from the</hi> Engliſh <hi>for that murder. But the</hi> Macquas <hi>told them it was now too late; for they were ſent for and were

now come, and would fall on them, if without their conſent they made a peace with the</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh. Said alſo, <hi>That a letter was ſhown to them from the governor of</hi> Port Royal, <hi>which,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>was taken in an</hi> Engliſh <hi>ſhip, being a letter from the queen of</hi> England, <hi>to our governor, writing how ſhe approved his deſigns, to enſnare, and deceitfully ſeize on, the</hi> Indians; <hi>ſo that being enraged from that letter, and being forced as it were, they began the preſent</hi> war. I told them the letter was a <hi>lie,</hi> forged by the <hi>French.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>next morning</hi> the <hi>bell rang</hi> for <hi>maſs:</hi> My maſter <hi>bid me go to church;</hi> I refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: He threatened me, and went away in a rage. At noon the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> ſent for me to dine with them, for I eat at their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble all the time I was at the fort. And after dinner they told me, <hi>the Indians would not allow of any of their captives ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their wigwams, whilſt they were at church; and were reſolved by force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to bring us all to church, if we would not go without.</hi> I told them it was high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unreaſonable ſo to impoſe upon thoſe who were of a contrary religion; and to force us to be preſent at ſuch a ſervice, as we abhorred, was nothing becoming chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity. They replied, <hi>They were ſavages,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:039104_0034_1013C26921666270"/>
and would not hearken to reaſon, but would have their wills:</hi> Said alſo, <hi>If they were in</hi> New England <hi>themſelves, they would go into their churches to ſee their ways of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</hi> I anſwered, the caſe was far differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, for there was nothing (themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing judges) as to matter or manner of <hi>worſhip,</hi> but what was according to the word of GOD, in our churches; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it could not be an offence to any man's conſcience. But among them there were <hi>idolatrous ſuperſtitions in worſhip:</hi> They ſaid, <hi>Come and ſee, and offer us conviction, of what is ſuperſtitious in worſhip.</hi> To which I anſwered, <hi>That I was not to do evil that good might come of it;</hi> and that forcing in matters of religion was hateful. They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>The Indians are reſolved to have it ſo, and they could not pacify them without my coming; and they would engage they ſhould offer no force or violence to cauſe any compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with their ceremonies.</hi> The <hi>next maſs,</hi> my maſter bid me go to <hi>church:</hi> I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; he roſe and forcibly pulled me by my head and ſhoulders out of the wigwam to the <hi>church,</hi> which was nigh the door. So I went in and ſat down behind the door, and there ſaw a great confuſion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of any <hi>goſpel order.</hi> For one of the
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:039104_0035_1013C2C18A016E90"/>
                        <hi>Jeſuits</hi> was at the altar, ſaying <hi>maſs</hi> in a tongue unknown to the ſavages; and the other, between the altar and the door, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſinging <hi>prayers</hi> among the <hi>Indians</hi> at the ſame time; and many others were at the ſame time ſaying over their <hi>pater noſters,</hi> and <hi>Ave Mary,</hi> by tale from their <hi>chapelit,</hi> or <hi>beads,</hi> on a ſtring. At our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, we ſmiled at their devotion ſo managed, which was offenſive to them: For they ſaid we made a deriſion of their worſhip. When I was here, a certain ſavages died; one of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> told me, <hi>She was a very holy woman, who had not committed one ſin in twelve years.</hi> After a day or two the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> aſked me, <hi>What I thought of their way, now I ſaw it?</hi> I told them, I thought Chriſt ſaid of it, as <hi>Mark</hi> vii. 7, 8, 9. <hi>Howbeit, in vain do they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip me, teaching for doctrines the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men. For laying aſide the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the waſhing of pots, and cups; and many other ſuch like things ye do. And he ſaid unto them, full well ye reject the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.</hi> They told me, <hi>They were not the commandments of men,</hi> but <hi>apoſtolical
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:039104_0036_1013C26AA7B033B8"/>
traditions,</hi> of equal authority with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſcriptures. And that after my death, I would bewail my not praying to the virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> and that I ſhould find the want of her interceſſion for me, <hi>with her Son;</hi> judging me to hell, <hi>for aſſerting the ſcriptures to be a perfect rule of faith;</hi> and ſaid, I abounded in my own ſenſe, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining explications contrary to the ſenſe of the <hi>Pope,</hi> regularly ſitting with a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral council, explaining ſcripture, and making articles of faith. I told them, it was my comfort that Chriſt was to be my <hi>judge,</hi> and not they at the <hi>great day:</hi> And as for their cenſuring and judging me, I was not moved with it.</p>
                     <p>One day a certain ſavageſs, taken priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner in <hi>Philip's</hi> war, who had lived at Mr. <hi>Bulkley's</hi> at <hi>Weathersfield,</hi> called <hi>Ruth,</hi> who could ſpeak Engliſh very well, and who had been often at my houſe; being now proſelyted to the <hi>Romiſh faith,</hi> came into the wigwam, and with her an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh maid,</hi> who was taken the laſt war, who was dreſſed in <hi>Indian</hi> apparel, unable to ſpeak one word of <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who ſaid ſhe could neither tell her own name, or the name of the place from whence ſhe was taken. Theſe two talked in the <hi>Indian</hi>
                        <pb n="39" facs="unknown:039104_0037_1013C2C312EF6D68"/>
dialect with my maſter a long time; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which my maſter bade me <hi>croſs my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;</hi> I told him I would not; he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me ſeveral times, and I as often refuſed. <hi>Ruth</hi> ſaid, Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> you know the ſcripture, and therefore act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your own light; for you know the ſcripture faith. <hi>Servants obey your maſters;</hi> he is your maſter, and you his ſervant. I told her ſhe was ignorant, and knew not the meaning of the ſcripture; telling her, <hi>I was not to diſobey the great God, to obey my maſter, and that I was ready to die to ſuffer for God, if called thereto:</hi> On which ſhe talked with my maſter, I ſuppoſe ſhe interpreted what I ſaid. My maſter took hold of my hand to force me to <hi>croſs my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> but I ſtruggled with him, and would not ſuffer him to guide my hand; upon this he pulled off a <hi>crucifix</hi> from off his own neck, and bade me kiſs it; but I refuſed once and again; he told me, he would daſh out my brains with his hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et if I refuſed. I told him, I ſhould ſooner chooſe death than to ſin againſt God; then he ran and took up his hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, and acted as tho' he would have daſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out my brains; ſeeing I was not mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he threw down his hatchet, ſaying, he
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:039104_0038_1013C26C2E789F28"/>
would firſt bite off all my nails, if I ſtill refuſed; I gave him my hand and told him, I was ready to ſuffer; he ſet his teeth in my thumb nail, and gave a gripe, and then ſaid, <hi>No good miniſter, no love God, as bad as the Devil;</hi> and ſo left off. I have reaſon to bleſs God, who ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened me to withſtand; by this he was ſo diſcouraged, as never more to meddle with me about my religion. I aſked leave of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> to pray with thoſe <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> of our town that were with me, but they abſolutely refuſed to give us any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to pray one with another, and did what they could to prevent our having any diſcourſe together.</p>
                     <p>After a few days the governor <hi>de'Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drel,</hi> governor in chief, ſent down two men with letters to the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> deſiring them to order my being ſent up to him to <hi>Montreal,</hi> upon which one of the <hi>Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its</hi> went with my two maſters, and took me along with them, as alſo two more from <hi>Deerfield,</hi> a man and his daughter about ſeven years of age. When we came to the <hi>lake,</hi> the wind was tempeſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and contrary to us, ſo that they were afraid to go over; they landed and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a fire, and ſaid they would wait a while
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:039104_0039_1013C2C5F7BC99B8"/>
to ſee whether the wind would fall or change. I went aſide from the company among the trees, and ſpread our caſe, with the temptations of it, before God, and pleaded that he would order the ſeaſon ſo that we might not go back again, but be furthered on our voyage, that I might have opportunity to ſee my children and neighbors, and converſe with them, and know their ſtate. When I returned, the wind was more boiſterous, and then a <hi>ſecond time,</hi> and the wind was more fierce; I reflected upon myſelf for my unquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the want of a reſigned will to the will of God. And a <hi>third time</hi> went and bewailed before God my anxious cares, and the tumultuous working of my own heart, begged a will fully reſigned to the will of God, and thought that by his grace I was brought to ſay <hi>amen</hi> to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God ſhould determine. Upon my return to the company, the wind was yet high; the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> and my maſter ſaid, come we will go back again to the fort; for there is no likelihood of proceeding in our voyage, for very frequently ſuch a wind continues three days, ſometimes ſix; after it continued ſo many hours, I ſaid

                     <p>When I came to Montreal, which was eight weeks<note n="*" place="bottom">Tueſday, April 25.</note> after my captivity; the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor <hi>de'Vaudrel</hi> redeemed me out of the hands of the <hi>Indians,</hi> gave me good cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, took me to his table, gave me the uſe of a very good chamber; and was in all reſpects relating to my outward man, courteous and charitable to admiration. At my firſt entering into his houſe, he ſent for my two children, who were in the city, that I might ſee them; and prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſed to do what he could to get all my children and neighbors out of the hands
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:039104_0041_1013C2CDB8D01910"/>
of the Savages. My change of diet, after the difficulties of my Journeys, cauſed an alteration in my body: I was <hi>phyſicked,</hi> and <hi>blooded,</hi> and very tenderly taken care of in my ſickneſs. The governor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed <hi>my eldeſt daughter</hi> out of the hands of the <hi>Indians;</hi> and ſhe was carefully tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>hoſpital,</hi> until ſhe was well of her lameneſs; and by the governor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for reſpectfully, during her ſtay in the country. <hi>My youngeſt child</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed by a gentlewoman in the city, as the <hi>Indians</hi> paſſed by. After the <hi>Indians</hi> had been at their fort, and diſcourſed with the prieſts, they came back and offered to the gentlewoman a man for the child, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that the child could not be prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itable to her, but the man would, for he was a weaver, and his ſervice would much advance the deſign ſhe had of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cloth: But GOD overruled ſo far, that this temptation to the woman pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed not for an exchange; for had the child gone to the <hi>Indian</hi> fort, in an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way it had abode there ſtill, as the reſt of the children carried there do. The governor gave orders to certain officers to get the <hi>reſt of my children</hi> out of the hands of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and as many of my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:039104_0042_1013C27886D9D478"/>
as they could. After ſix weeks, a merchant of the city obtained my eldeſt ſon, that was taken, to live with him: He took a great deal of pains to perſuade the ſavages to part with him. An <hi>Indian</hi> came to the city (Sagamore <hi>George</hi> of <hi>Pennacook</hi>) from <hi>Cowaſs,</hi> and brought word of my ſon <hi>Stephens'</hi> being near that place; ſome money was put into his hand for his redemption, and a promiſe of full ſatisfaction if he brought him; but the <hi>Indian</hi> proved unfaithful, and I never ſaw <hi>my child</hi> till a year after.</p>
                     <p>The governor ordered a <hi>Prieſt</hi> to go along with me to ſee <hi>my youngeſt daughter</hi> among the <hi>Macquas,</hi> and endeavor for her ranſom. I went with him; he was very courteous to me, and from his pariſh which was near the <hi>Macqua</hi> fort, he wrote a letter to the <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> to deſire him to ſend <hi>my child</hi> to ſee me, and to ſpeak with them that took her, to come along with it. But the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> wrote back a letter, <hi>that I ſhould not be permitted to ſpeak with, or ſee my child, and if I came my labor would be loſt; and that the</hi> Macquas <hi>would as ſoon part with their hearts, as my child.</hi> At my return to the city, I with an heavy heart carried the <hi>Jeſuit's</hi> letter to the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:039104_0043_1013C2CF41FCAAC0"/>
who when he read it, was very angry, and endeavored to comfort me, aſſuring me <hi>I ſhould ſee it, and ſpeak with it;</hi> and he would to his utmoſt endeavor for it's ranſom: Accordingly he ſent to the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> who were in the city, and bid them improve their intereſt for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the child. After ſome days, he went with mé in his own perſon to <hi>the fort.</hi> When we came thither, he diſcourſed with the <hi>Jeſuit:</hi> After which my child was brought into the <hi>chamber</hi> where I was, I was told I might ſpeak with her, but ſhould not be permitted to ſpeak to no other <hi>Engliſh</hi> perſon there. <hi>My child</hi> was <hi>about ſeven years old;</hi> I diſcourſed with her near an hour; ſhe could read very well, and had not forgot her <hi>catechiſm;</hi> and was very deſirous to be redeemed out of the hands of the <hi>Macquas,</hi> and bemoan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſtate among them, telling me how they prophaned God's <hi>ſabbath,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>ſhe thought that a few days before they had been mocking the devil, and that one of the Jeſuits ſtood and looked on them.</hi> I told her, ſhe muſt <hi>pray to God</hi> for his grace every day; ſhe ſaid, <hi>ſhe did as was able, and God helped her: But,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>they force me to ſay ſome prayers in</hi> latin, <hi>but I don't under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:039104_0044_1013C27A0CA17D70"/>
one word of them, I hope it wont do me any harm.</hi> I told her ſhe muſt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſhe did not forget her <hi>catechiſm,</hi> and the <hi>ſcriptures</hi> ſhe had learnt by heart. She told the captives after I was gone, as ſome of them have ſince informed me, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every thing I ſpake to her; and ſaid, <hi>ſhe was much afraid ſhe ſhould forget her catechiſm,</hi> having none to inſtruct her. I ſaw her once a few days after in the city, but' had not many minutes of time with her, but what time I had improved to give her the beſt advice I could. The governor laboured much for her redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at laſt he had the promiſe of it, in caſe he would procure for them, an <hi>Indian</hi> girl in her ſtead. Accordingly he <hi>ſent</hi> up the river ſome hundred of leagues for one, and when offered by the governor it was refuſed: He offered them an hundred pieces of eight for her redemption, but it was refuſed. His lady went over to have begged her from them, but all in vain; <hi>it is there ſtill; and has forgotten to ſpeak Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh.</hi> Oh! that all who peruſe this hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, would join in their fervent requeſts to God, <hi>with whom all things are poſſible,</hi> that this poor child, and ſo many others of our children who have been <hi>caſt upon God
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:039104_0045_1013C2D104B9F218"/>
from the womb,</hi> and are now <hi>outcaſts ready to periſh,</hi> might be gathered from their diſperſions, and receive <hi>ſanctifying grace</hi> from God.</p>
                     <p>When I had diſcourſed with the child, and was coming out of the fort, one of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> went out of the chamber with me, and ſome ſoldiers to convey me to the <hi>canoe.</hi> I ſaw ſome of my poor neighbors, who ſtood with longing expectations to ſee me, and ſpeak with me, and had leave from their ſavage maſters ſo to do. I was by the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> himſelf thruſt along by force, and permitted only to tell them ſome of their relations they aſked after, were well in the city, and that with a very audable voice; being not permitted to come near to them.</p>
                     <p>After my return to the city, I was very melancholy, for I could not be permitted ſo much as to pray with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who dwelt in the ſame houſe. And the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> who came to ſee me, were moſt of them put back by the guard at the door, and not ſuffered to come and ſpeak with me. Sometimes the guard was ſo ſtrict that I could ſcarce go aſide on neceſſary occaſions without a repulſe; and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I went out into the city (a favor the
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:039104_0046_1013C28080941A10"/>
governor himſelf never refuſed when I aſked it of him) there were ſpies to watch me, and to obſerve whether I ſpake to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Upon which I told ſome of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they muſt be careful to call to mind and improve former inſtructions, and endeavor to ſtand at a further diſtance for a while, hoping that after a ſhort time I ſhould have more liberty of converſing with them. But ſome ſpies ſent out, found on a ſabbath day more than three of us in company together, the number we by their order publiſhed were not to exceed, who informed the <hi>Prieſt;</hi> the next day one of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> told me, I had a greater number of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> with me, and that I had ſpoken ſomething re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting on their religion. I ſpake to the governor that no forcible means might be uſed with any of the captives reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their religion; he told me he allowed no ſuch thing. I am perſuaded that the governor, if he might act for himſelf, would not have ſuffered ſuch things to be done as have been done, and that he never did know of ſeveral things acted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At my firſt coming to <hi>Montreal,</hi> the governor told me, <hi>I ſhould be ſent home as
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:039104_0047_1013C2D3DDCB0B70"/>
ſoon as Captain</hi> Battiſs <hi>was returned, and not before; and that I was taken in order to his redemption.</hi> The governor ſought by all means to divert me from my melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly ſorrows, and always ſhewed a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs for my ſeeing my children. One day I told him of my deſign of walking into the city; he pleaſantly anſwered, <hi>Go with all my heart.</hi> His eldeſt ſon went with me as far as the door, and ſaw the guard ſtop me, he went and informed his father, who came to the door and aſked, <hi>Why they affronted the gentleman going out?</hi> they ſaid, <hi>It was their order:</hi> But with an angry countenance he ſaid, <hi>His orders were that I ſhould not be ſtopped.</hi> But within a little time I had orders to go down to <hi>Quebeck.</hi> Another thing ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that many things are done without the governor's conſent, tho' his name be uſed to juſtify them, <abbr>
                           <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </abbr> I aſked the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> after I had been at <hi>Montreal</hi> two days, leave to go and ſee my youngeſt child; he ſaid, <hi>Whenever you would ſee it, tell me, and I will bring it to you; for,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the governor is not willing you ſhould go thither.</hi> And yet not many days after, when we were at dinner, the governor's
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:039104_0048_1013C283F0CD7C08"/>
lady (ſeeing me ſad) ſpake to an officer at table, who could ſpeak <hi>latin,</hi> to tell me, <hi>That after dinner I ſhould go along with them and ſee my two children.</hi> And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly after dinner I was carried to ſee them; and when I came to the houſe, I found three or four Engliſh captives who lived there, and I had leave to diſcourſe with them. And not long after, the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor's lady aſked me to go along with her to the hoſpital to ſee one of my neighbors who was ſick there.</p>
                     <p>One day one of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> came to the governor, and told the company there, <hi>That he never ſaw ſuch perſons as were taken from</hi> Deerfield; ſaid he, <hi>The</hi> Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quas <hi>will not ſuffer any of their priſoners to abide in their wigwams whilſt they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are at maſs, but carry them with them to the church, and they cannot be prevailed with to fall down on their knees to pray there, but no ſooner are they returned to their wigwams, but they fall down on their knees to prayer.</hi> He ſaid, <hi>They could do nothing with the grown perſons there; and they hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the childrens complying.</hi> Whereupon the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> counſelled the <hi>Macquas</hi> to fell all the grown perſons from the fort; a ſtratagem to ſeduce poor children. <hi>Oh

                     </p>
                     <p>Here I obſerved, they were wonderfully lifted up with pride, after the return of captain <hi>Montinug</hi> from <hi>Northampton,</hi> with news of ſucceſs: They boaſted of their ſucceſs againſt <hi>New-England.</hi> And they ſent out an army as they ſaid of ſeven hundred men, if I miſtake not, two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of which were <hi>French,</hi> in company of which army went ſeveral <hi>Jeſuits;</hi> and ſaid, <hi>They would lay deſolate all the places on</hi> Connecticut <hi>river.</hi> The ſuperior of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> told me, <hi>Their general was a very prudent and brave commander, of undaunted courage, and he doubted not but they ſhould have great ſucceſs.</hi> This army went away in ſuch a boaſting triumphing manner; that I had great hopes God would diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and diſappoint their deſigns: Our prayers were not wanting for the blaſting of ſuch a bloody deſign. The ſuperior of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> ſaid to me, <hi>Do not flatter yourſelves in hopes of a ſhort captivity; for,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>There are</hi> two young princes <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending for the kingdom of</hi> Spain; <hi>and for a</hi> third, <hi>that care was to be taken of his eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment on the</hi> Engliſh <hi>throne.</hi> And boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:039104_0050_1013C28598AA7400"/>
what they would do in <hi>Europe;</hi> and that we muſt expect not only in <hi>Europe,</hi> but in <hi>New-England,</hi> the eſtabliſhment of <hi>popery.</hi> I ſaid, glory not, God can make great changes in a little time, and revive his own intereſt, and yet ſave his poor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted people. Said he, <hi>The time for mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acles is paſt;</hi> and in the time of the laſt war, <hi>the king of France was as it were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the world, and yet did very great things; but now the kingdom of</hi> Spain <hi>is for him, and the duke of</hi> Bavaria, <hi>and the duke of</hi> Savoy, &amp;c. and ſpake on a lofty man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of great things to be done by them; and having the world, as I may ſay, in ſubjection to them.</p>
                     <p>I was ſent down to <hi>Quebeck</hi> in company of governor <hi>de Ramſay,</hi> governor of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treal,</hi> and the ſuperior of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and ordered to live with one of the council; from whom I received many favors, for ſeven weeks. He told me, It was the <hi>Prieſts</hi> doings to ſend me down before the governor came down; and that if I went much to ſee the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or they came much to viſit me, I ſhould yet certainly be ſent away where I ſhould have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>

                     <p>After coming down to <hi>Quebeck,</hi> I was invited to dine with the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and to my face they were civil enough. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a few days, a young gentleman came to my chamber, and told me, that one of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> (after we had done dinner) made a few <hi>diſtricks</hi> of verſes, and gave them to his ſcholars to tranſlate into <hi>French:</hi> He ſhewed them to me. The import of them was, <q>That the king of <hi>France</hi>'s grandſon had ſent out his huntſmen, and that they had taken a <hi>wolf,</hi> who was ſhut up, and now he hopes the ſheep would be in ſafety.</q> I knew at the reading of them what they aimed at, but held my peace, as though I had been ignorant of the <hi>Jeſuits'</hi> intention. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving this reproaching ſpirit, I ſaid in my heart, <hi>If God will bleſs, let men curſe if they pleaſe:</hi> and I looked to God in Chriſt, the great <hi>Shepherd,</hi> to keep his ſcattered ſheep among ſo many <hi>Lamiſh</hi> ravenous wolves, and to remember the reproaches wherewith his holy name, ordinances and ſervants were daily reproached. And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an obſervation of the time of theſe verſes being compoſed, I find that near
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:039104_0052_1013C288FB3AB458"/>
the ſame time, the biſhop of <hi>Canada</hi> with twenty eccleſiaſticks, were taken by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as they were coming from <hi>France,</hi> and carried into <hi>England</hi> as priſoners of war.</p>
                     <p>One ſabbath day morning I obſerved many ſigns of approaching rain, a great moiſture on the ſtones of the hearth and chimney jams. I was that day invit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to dine with the <hi>Jeſuits;</hi> and when I went up to dinner, it began to rain a ſmall driſling rain: The ſuperior told me, <hi>They had been praying for rain that morning, and lo,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>it begins to rain.</hi> I told him, I <hi>could tell him of many inſtances of God's hearing our prayers for rain.</hi> However in the afternoon there was a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral proceſſion of all orders, <hi>Prieſts, Jeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uits,</hi> and <hi>Fryars,</hi> and the citizens in great pomp, carrying (as they ſaid) as an holy relic, one of the bones of St. <hi>Paul.</hi> The next day I was invited to the prieſts ſeminary to dinner; <hi>Oh,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>we went in proceſſion yeſterday for rain, and ſee what a plentiful rain followed.</hi> I anſwered, <hi>We had been anſwered when praying for rain, when no ſuch ſigns of rain, or the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of rain had preceded, as now with them, before they appointed or began their
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:039104_0053_1013C2DE1FC0D860"/>
proceſſion,</hi> &amp;c. However they upbraided me, <hi>That God did not approve of our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, in that he diſregarded our prayers, and accepted theirs. For,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>We heard you had days of faſting and prayer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fleet came to</hi> Quebeck; <hi>God would not regard your prayers, but heard ours, and almoſt in a miraculous way preſerved us when aſſaulted, and refuſed to hear your</hi> faſt day prayers <hi>for your preſervation, but heard our's for your deſolation, and our ſucceſs.</hi> They boaſted alſo of their king, and his greatneſs, and ſpake of him as tho' there could be no ſettlement in the world, but as he pleaſed; reviling us as in a low and languiſhing caſe, having no king, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the government of a queen: And ſpake as tho' the duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> would in a ſhort time be emperor. From this day forward God gave them to hear ſorrowful tidings from <hi>Europe:</hi> That a war had been commenced againſt the duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and ſo their enemies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed: That their biſhop was taken, and two millions of wealth with him.

And their great army going againſt New-England, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back aſhamed; and they diſcouraged and diſheartened, and every year very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing fears and cares as to the <hi>ſavages</hi> who lived up the river. Before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of that army, they told me, we were led up and down, and ſold by the heath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, as ſheep for the ſlaughter, and they could not deviſe what they ſhould do with us, we ſhould be ſo many priſoners, when the army returned. The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> told me, it was a great mercy that ſo many of our children were brought to them, and that now eſpecially ſince they were not like ſpeedily to be returned, there was hope of their being brought over to the <hi>Romiſh faith.</hi> They would take the <hi>Engliſh children</hi> born among them, and againſt the conſent of their parents, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize them. One <hi>Jeſuit</hi> came to me and aſked, whether all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at <hi>Loret</hi> (a place not far from <hi>Quebeck</hi> where the ſavages lived) were baptized? I told him, <hi>they were.</hi> He ſaid, <hi>If they be not,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:039104_0055_1013C2DFB12E2DF0"/>
let me know of it, that I may baptize them, for fear they ſhould die, and be damned, if they die without baptiſm.</hi> Says he, <hi>When the ſavages went againſt you, I charged them to baptize all children before they killed them; ſuch was my deſire of your eternal ſalvation, tho' you were our enemies.</hi> There was a gentleman called Monſieur <hi>de Beauville,</hi> a captain, the brother of the <hi>Lord intendant,</hi> who was a good friend to me, and very courteous to all the captives; he lent me an <hi>Engliſh bible,</hi> and when he went to <hi>France</hi> gave it to me.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>All means were uſed to ſeduce poor ſouls.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I was invited one day to dine with one of chief note; as I was going, I met with the ſuperior of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> coming out of the houſe, and he came in after dinner; and preſently it was propounded to me, if I would ſtay among them, and be of their religion, I ſhould have a great and honorable penſion from the king every year. The ſuperior of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> turned to me, and ſaid, <q>Sir, you have manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much grief and ſorrow for your ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aration from ſo many of your neighbors and children; if you will now comply with this offer and propoſal, you may have all your children with you; and
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:039104_0056_1013C29056EBBCA0"/>
here will be enough for an honorable maintenance for you and them. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>Sir, if I thought your religion to be true, I would embrace it freely without any ſuch offer, but ſo long as I believe it to be what it is, the offer of the whole world is of no more value to me than a</hi> BLACK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BERRY;</q> and manifeſted ſuch an abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of this propoſal, that I ſpeedily went to take my leave, and begone. Oh; <hi>Sir,</hi> (ſaid he) <q>

                     <p>I am perſuaded that the <hi>Prieſt</hi> of that pariſh where I kept, abhorred their ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the heathen to commit out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages againſt the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> ſaying, It was more like committing murders, than managing a war.

<pb n="61" facs="unknown:039104_0059_1013C2E98B4135D8"/>
that our friends in <hi>New-England,</hi> might have grace to make a more thankful and faithful improvement of the means of grace, than we had done; who by our neglects, find ourſelves out of GOD'S ſanctuary.</p>
                     <p>On the <hi>twenty firſt</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> 1704, I received ſome letters from <hi>New-England,</hi> with an account that many of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors eſcaped out of the deſolations in the fort; and that my dear wife was decently buried; And that my eldeſt ſon who was abſent in our deſolation, was ſent to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, and provided for; which occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thankſgiving to GOD in the midſt of afflictions, and cauſed prayers even in <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ada,</hi> to be going daily up to heaven for a bleſſing on benefactors, ſhowing ſuch kindneſs to the deſolate and afflicted.</p>
                     <p>The conſideration of ſuch crafty deſigns to enſnare young ones, and to turn them from the ſimplicity of the goſpel, to <hi>Rom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> ſuperſtition, was very exerciſing. Sometimes they would tell me my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſometimes my neighbors, were turned to be of their religion.

ſome offered abuſive carriage to ſuch as refuſed to go to church, and be preſent at maſs. Some they induſtriouſly contrived to get married among them. A <hi>Prieſt</hi> drew up a <hi>Compendium</hi> of the <hi>Romiſh Catholic Faith,</hi> and pretended to prove it by the ſcriptures, telling the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> "that all they required was contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſcriptures which they acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edged to be the rule of faith and manners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" but it was by ſcriptures horribly pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and abuſed.

                     <p>THE hearts of ſome were ready to be diſcouraged, and ſink, ſaying, They were out of ſight, and ſo out of mind. I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to perſuade them we were not forgotten; that undoubtedly many pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were going up to heaven for us. Not long after came captain <hi>Livingſton</hi> and Mr. <hi>Shelden,</hi> with letters from his excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy our governor, to the governor of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ada</hi> about the exchange of priſoners; which gave a revival to many, and raiſed expectation of a return. Theſe viſits from <hi>New-England</hi> to <hi>Canada</hi> ſo often, greatly ſtrengthened many who were ready to ſaint; and gave ſome check to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> to gain proſelytes. But God's time of deliverance was not yet come: As to ſome particular perſons, their temptations and trials were increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and ſome abuſed becauſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed compliance with their ſuperſtitions. A young woman of our town met with a
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:039104_0063_1013C2EED837B500"/>
new trial: For one day a <hi>Frenchman</hi> came into the room where ſhe was, and ſhewed her his beads, and boaſted of them, putting them near to her; ſhe knocked them out of his hands on the floor; for which ſhe was beaten and threatened with death, and for ſome days impriſoned. I pleaded with God his overruling this firſt eſſay for the deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſome, as a pledge of the reſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delivered in due time. I implored Capt. <hi>de Beauville</hi> who had always been very friendly, to intercede with the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor for the return of my eldeſt daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and for his purchaſing my ſon <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen,</hi> from the <hi>Indians</hi> at St. <hi>Francois</hi> fort; and for liberty to go up and ſee my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and neighbors at <hi>Montreal.</hi> Divine providence appeared to the moderating my afflictions, in that five <hi>Engliſh</hi> perſons of our town were permitted to return with Capt. <hi>Livingſton,</hi> among whom went my eldeſt daughter. And my ſon <hi>Stephen</hi> was redeemed and ſent to live with me: He was almoſt quite naked, and very poor; he had ſuffered much among the <hi>Indians.</hi> One of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> took upon him, to come to the wigwam, and whip
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:039104_0064_1013C29F9E99A610"/>
him, on ſome complaints that the <hi>Squaws</hi> had made, that he did not work enough for them. As to my petition for going up to <hi>Montreal,</hi> to ſee my children and neighbors, it was denied; as my former deſire of coming up to the city before Capt. <hi>Livingſton'</hi>s coming, was. GOD granted me favor as to two of my peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but yet brought me by his grace to be willing, that he ſhould glorify him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in diſpoſing of me and mine as he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and knew to be moſt for his glory. And almoſt always before any remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble favor, I was brought to lie down at the foot of GOD, and made to be willing that GOD ſhould govern the world, ſo as might be moſt for his own honor, and brought to reſign all to his holy ſovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. A frame of ſpirit when wrought in me by the Grace of GOD, giving the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt content and ſatisfaction; and very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a forerunner of the mercy aſked of GOD, or a plain demonſtration, that the not obtaining my requeſt was beſt for me. I had no ſmall refreſhing, in having one of my children with me for four months. And the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were many of them ſtrengthened with hopes, that the treaties

They told me that an <hi>Indian</hi> had died at the place where they were, and that when ſundry of his relations were together, in order to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his funeral, the dead aroſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed them, "That at his death he went to hell, and there he ſaw all the <hi>Indians</hi> that had been dead ſince their embracing the Popiſh religion; and warned them to leave it off, or they would be damned too;" and laid down dead again. They ſaid the <hi>Indians</hi> were frightened, and very mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancholy: but the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> to whom they told this, told them it was only a deluſion of the devil, to draw them away from the true religion; adding, <hi>That he knew for certain, that all thoſe</hi> Indians <hi>who had been dead, ſpoken of by that</hi> Indian, <hi>were in</hi> heaven, <hi>only</hi> one ſquaw <hi>was gone to</hi> hell, <hi>who died without baptiſm.</hi> Theſe maids ſaid alſo, that many of the <hi>Indians</hi> much lamented their making a war againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> at the inſtigation of the <hi>French.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Prieſts,</hi> after Mr. <hi>Dudley'</hi>s going from <hi>Canada,</hi> were ready to think their
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:039104_0069_1013C2F93804CE18"/>
time was ſhort for gaining <hi>Engliſh</hi> proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes, and doubled their diligence and wiles, to gain over perſons to their perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. I improved all opportunities I could, to write to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that in that way I might be ſerviceable to them. But many or moſt of my letters treating about reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, were intercepted, and burnt. I had a letter ſent down to me by order of the governor, that I had liberty of writing to my children and friends, which ſhould be continued; provided I wrote about indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent things, and ſaid nothing in them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the points in controverſy between them and us: And if I was ſo hardy as to write letters otherwiſe, they ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to prevent their being delivered. Accordingly I found many of them were burnt. Sometimes notice would be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that they were burnt; ſo that their writing was ſomewhat uſeful, though never peruſed by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they judged thoſe letters condemned <hi>Popery.</hi> Many of our letters written from <hi>New-England</hi> were never delivered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of ſome expreſſions about religion in them. And as I ſaid before, after Mr. <hi>Dudley'</hi>s departure from <hi>Quebeck,</hi> endeavors were very vigorous to ſeduce. Some
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:039104_0070_1013C2A84A768338"/>
were flattered with large promiſes, others were threatened and beaten, becauſe they would not turn. And when two Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, women, who had always oppoſed their religion, were ſick in the hoſpital, they kept with them night and day, till they died, and their friends were kept from coming to viſit them: After their death, they gave out that they died in the <hi>Rom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Faith,</hi> and were received into their <hi>communion.</hi> Before their death maſſes were ſaid for them, and they were buried in the church yard, with all their ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. And after this, letters were ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all parts to inform the <hi>Engliſh</hi> that theſe two women turned to their religion before their death, and that it concerned them to follow their example; for they could not be more obſtinate than thoſe women were in their health, againſt the <hi>Romiſh Faith,</hi> and yet on a death-bed they embraced it. They told the <hi>Engliſh</hi> who lived near, <hi>That our religion was a dangerous religion to die in.</hi> But I ſhall hereafter relate the juſt grounds we have to think theſe things were falſehoods.</p>
                     <p>I was informed, there was an <hi>Engliſh</hi> girl bid to take and wear the croſs, and croſs herſelf: She refuſed; they threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:039104_0071_1013C2FAC209D1F0"/>
her, and ſhewed her the Croſs. At length ſhe had her choice, either to croſs herſelf, and take the croſs, or be whipt, ſhe choſe to be whipt; and they took up her clothes, and made as tho' they would correct her; but ſeeing her chooſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to ſuffer rather than comply, they deſiſted and tied the Croſs about her neck. Some were taken and ſhut up among the religious, and all ſorts of means uſed to gain them.</p>
                     <p>I received a letter from one of my neighbors, wherein he thus bewails: <q>I obtained leave of my maſter to go to the <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>qua</hi> fort to ſee my children, that I had not ſeen for a long time: I carried a letter from my maſter, to ſhew that I had leave to come. When I came to the ſort, I heard that one of my children was in the woods. I went to ſee a boy I had there, who lived with one of the <hi>Jeſuits;</hi> I had juſt aſked him of his welfare, he ſaid his maſter would come preſently, he durſt not ſtay to ſpeak with me now, being in ſuch awe of his maſter. On which I withdrew, and when his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter came in, I went and aſked leave of him to ſpeak with my child, and ſhewed
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:039104_0072_1013C2AB96FE2390"/>
him my letter. But he abſolutely refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to let me ſee or ſpeak with him; and ſaid, I had brought no letter from the governor, and would not permit me to ſtay in the fort, though I had travelled on foot near fifty miles for no other er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand than to ſee and ſpeak with my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſame perſon, with another <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> laſt ſpring, obtained leave of the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor general, to go to the ſame fort on the fame errand, and carried letters from the governor to the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> that he might be permitted to ſpeak with his children. The letter was delivered to the <hi>Jeſuits;</hi> who told him, his ſon was not at home, but gone a hunting. Whereas he was hid from them, as he heard afterwards, ſo the poor man loſt his labour a ſecond time. Theſe men ſay, that when they returned to <hi>Montreal,</hi> one <hi>Laland,</hi> who was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a ſpy, always to obſerve the motions of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> told them, that one of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> had come in before them, and had told the governor that the lad was gone a hunting; and that the <hi>Engliſhman</hi> who accompanied this poor man, went out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the woods in hopes of finding the lad, and ſaw him, but the lad run away, and
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:039104_0073_1013C30417651ED8"/>
that he followed him and called after him, but he would not ſtop; but holding out a gun, threatened to ſhoot him down, if he followed him, and ſo he was diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged, and turned back. And ſays LA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND, <hi>you will never leave going to ſee your children and neighbors, till ſome of you are killed.</hi> But the men told him, it was an abſolute lie, let who would report it; for they had neither ſeen the lad, nor did they go into the woods to ſearch after him. They judge this was told to the governor, to prevent any <hi>Engliſh</hi> for the future go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no ſee their children and neighbors. Some of ours ſay, they have been little better than abſolutely promiſed, to have their children who are among the <hi>Savages,</hi> in caſe they themſelves would embrace <hi>Popery.</hi> And that the <hi>Prieſts</hi> had ſaid, <hi>They had rather the children ſhould be among the</hi> Indians, <hi>as they were, than be brought out by the</hi> French, <hi>and ſo be in a readineſs to return for</hi> New-England.</p>
                     <p>A maid of our town was put into a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious houſe among the <hi>Nuns,</hi> for more than two years, and all ſorts of means, by flatteries, threatenings and abuſive carriage uſed to bring her to turn. They of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered her money, which when refuſed, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:039104_0074_1013C2B2719E7420"/>
the latter part of the time, they threatened her very much; ſent for her before them, commanded her to <hi>croſs her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> She refuſed, they hit her a box on the ear; bid her again, ſtill ſhe refuſed. They ordered a rod with ſix branches full of knots to be brought; and when ſhe refuſed, they ſtruck her on the hands, ſtill renewing their commands; and ſhe ſtood to her refuſals, till her hands were filled with wales, with the blows. But one ſaid, beat her no more, we will give her to the <hi>Indians,</hi> if ſhe will not turn. They pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her arms till they were black and blue; and made her go into their church; and becauſe ſhe would not <hi>croſs herſelf,</hi> ſtruck her ſeveral blows with their hands on her face. A <hi>Squaw</hi> was brought in and ſaid, <hi>She was ſent in to fetch her to the</hi> INDIANS; but ſhe refuſed; the <hi>Squaw</hi> went away, and ſaid, <hi>She would bring her huſband with her tomorrow, and ſhe ſhould be carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by force.</hi> She told me, ſhe remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered what I told her one day, after the <hi>Nuns</hi> had threatened to give her away to the <hi>Indians;</hi> that they only ſaid ſo to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright her, that they never would give her away. The <hi>Nuns</hi> told her, <hi>She ſhould not be permitted any more to ſpeak to the</hi> Engliſh;
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:039104_0075_1013C3059B9D3AA8"/>
                        <hi>and that they would afflict her without giving her any reſt, if ſhe refuſed:</hi> But GOD pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved her from falling. <hi>This poor girl</hi> had many prayers going up to heaven for her, daily, and by name, becauſe her tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als were more known to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> than the trials of others, who lived, more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from them.</p>
                     <p>Here might be an hiſtory by itſelf, of the trials and ſufferings of many of our children, and young ones, who have been abuſed, and after ſeparation from grown perſons, made to do as they would have them.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall here give an account of what was done to one of my children, a boy between fifteen and ſixteen years of age, two hundred miles diſtant from me, which occaſioned a grief and ſorrow, that I want words to utter; and yet was kept under ſuch awe, that he never durſt write any thing to me, for fear of being diſcovered in writing about religion. They threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to put him to the <hi>Indians</hi> again, if he would not turn; telling him, <hi>He was nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er bought out of their hands, but only ſojourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them, but if he would turn, he ſhould never be put into their hands any more.</hi> The
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:039104_0076_1013C2B3F60E7870"/>
                        <hi>Prieſts</hi> would ſpend whole days in urging him. He was ſent to ſchool to learn to read and write French; the ſchool maſter ſometimes flattered him with promiſes, if he would <hi>croſs</hi> himſelf, then threatened him if he would not. But when he ſaw flattering promiſes of rewards, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enings were ineffectual, he ſtruck him with a ſtick he had in his hand; and when he ſaw that would not do, he made him get down on his knees about an hour, and then came and bid him make the ſign of the <hi>croſs,</hi> and that without any delay; he ſtill refuſed. Then he gave him a couple of ſtrokes with a whip he had in his hand; which whip had three branches, and about twelve great knots tied to it: And again bid him make the ſign of the <hi>croſs;</hi> and if it was any ſin, he would bear it himſelf; and ſaid alſo, <hi>You are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid you ſhall be changed if you do it; but</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>you will be the ſame, your fingers wont be changed.</hi> And after he had made him ſhed many tears, under his abuſes and threatenings, he told him, <hi>He would have it done:</hi> And ſo through cowardice and fear of the whip, he made the ſign, and did ſo for ſeveral days together, and with much ado, he was firſt brought to <hi>croſs</hi> himſelf,
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:039104_0077_1013C307219D1658"/>
and then the maſter told him, <hi>He would have it done without his particular biding him.</hi> And when he came to ſay his leſſon, and croſſed not himſelf, the maſter ſaid, <hi>Have you forgot what I bid you do?</hi> No Sir, ſaid he: Then the ſchool maſter ſaid, <hi>Down on your knees;</hi> and ſo kept him for an hour and an half, till ſchool was done; and ſo did for about a week. When he ſaw this would not do, he took the whip, <hi>What wont you do it,</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>I will make you;</hi> and ſo again frightened him to a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. After this, commanded him to go to church: When he refuſed, he told him, <hi>he would make him:</hi> And one morning ſent four of the biggeſt boys of the ſchool, to draw him by force to <hi>maſs.</hi> Theſe, with other ſeverities, and witty ſtratagems were uſed; and I utterly ignorant of any attempt made upon him, to bring him to change his religion. His fear was ſuch, that he never durſt write any of theſe things, leſt his letters ſhould fall into their hands, and he ſhould again be delivered to the <hi>Indians.</hi> Hearing of an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of writing to him by one of the pariſh where I was, going up to <hi>Montreal,</hi> I wrote a letter to him, and had by him a
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:039104_0078_1013C37F90242BF0"/>

                           <p>I HAVE received your letter bearing date January 11th, 1705-6, for which I give you many thanks, with my duty, and my brother's. I am ſorry you have not received all the letters I have wrote to you; as I have not received all yours. According to your good counſel, I do almoſt every day read ſomething of the bible, and ſo ſtrengthen my faith. As to the captives newly brought, <hi>Lancaſter</hi> is the place of two of them, and <hi>Marlbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi> that of the third; the governor of <hi>Montreal</hi> has them all three. There is other news that will ſeem more ſtrange to you: That two Engliſh women, who in their life time were dreadfully ſet againſt the catholick religion, did on their death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed embrace it. The one <hi>Abigail Turbet,</hi> the other of them <hi>Eſther Jones,</hi> both of them known to you. <hi>Abigail Turbet</hi> ſent for Mr. <hi>Meriel</hi> the ſabbath before ſhe died, and ſaid (many a time upon ſeveral fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing days) <hi>That ſhe committed her ſoul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hands, and was ready to do whatever he pleaſed.</hi> She deſired him to go to the chappel St. <hi>Anne,</hi> and there to ſay a <hi>holy
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:039104_0079_1013C364617ADCA0"/>
maſs</hi> for her, that ſhe might have her ſins pardoned, and the will of the LORD ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed upon her. Her couſin Mrs. <hi>Badſton,</hi> now <hi>Stilſon,</hi> aſked her, <hi>Whether ſhe would be willing to do as ſhe ſaid?</hi> She anſwered, yes. And upon the Tueſday ſhe was taken into the catholick church in the preſence of <hi>John Laland,</hi> and madam <hi>Grizalem,</hi> an Engliſh woman, and Mrs. <hi>Stilſon</hi> alſo, with many <hi>French</hi> people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides. She was anointed with oil on the ſame day, according to her will then. Upon the Wedneſday following an image of Chriſt crucified, was brought to her, ſhe cauſed it to be ſet up over againſt her at the curtains of her bed, and looked continually upon the ſame; and alſo a little crucifix was brought unto her, ſhe took it, and kiſſed it, and laid it upon her ſtomach. She did alſo make the ſign of the croſs upon herſelf, when ſhe took any meat or drink. She promiſed to GOD, that if ſhe ſhould recover, ſhe would go to the <hi>maſs</hi> every day: She having on her hand a crucifix, ſaid, <hi>Oh my Lord, that I ſhould have known thee ſo late!</hi> She did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo make a prayer to the virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> the two laſt days of the week. She could utter no word, but by kiſſing the crucifix,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:039104_0080_1013C38323DE2100"/>
and endeavouring to croſs herſelf, ſhe gave an evidence of her faith. She died Sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urday the 24th of November, at three o'clock in the afternoon. The next day the <hi>Prieſts</hi> did commend the woman's ſoul to the prayers of the congregation in the <hi>maſs:</hi> In the afternoon ſhe was honorably buried in the church yard next to the church, cloſe to the body of the juſtice <hi>Peſe'</hi>s wife; all the people being preſent at her funeral. The ſame day in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Mr. <hi>Meriel</hi> with an Engliſh woman, went to <hi>Eſther Jones;</hi> ſhe did at firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, but a little while after ſhe confeſſed there were ſeven ſacraments, <hi>Chriſt's body preſent,</hi> the <hi>ſacrament of the maſs,</hi> the <hi>ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qality of power among the paſtors of the church;</hi> and being returned to wait by her all night long, he read and expounded to her ſome part of the <hi>Catholick Confeſſion of Faith</hi> to her ſatisfaction. About mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night he aſked, <hi>Whether ſhe might not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs her ſins? I doubt not but I may,</hi> ſaid ſhe: And two hours after ſhe made unto him fervent confeſſion of all the ſins of her whole life. When he ſaid, <hi>He was to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Chriſt to his Father for her,</hi> ſhe liked it very well. The ſuperior of the Nuns be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come to ſee her, ſhe now deſired that
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:039104_0081_1013C32BE6BF6348"/>
ſhe might receive Chriſt's body before ſhe died. She did alſo ſhew Mrs. <hi>Stilſon</hi> a great mind to receive the ſacrament of <hi>Extreme Unction;</hi> and ſaid, <hi>That if ever ſhe ſhould recover and get home, ſhe would reproach the</hi> miniſters, <hi>for their neglecting that ſacrament, ſo plainly commanded by St.</hi> James. In the afternoon, after ſhe had begged pardon for her wavering, the Catholick Confeſſion of Faith was read a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud to her in the hearing of Mr. <hi>Crafton,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Stilſon,</hi> and another <hi>Engliſh</hi> woman, and ſhe owned the ſame. About ſeven o'clock the ſame day, ſhe ſaid to Mr. <hi>Dubiſon, Shall not they give me the holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion?</hi> But her tongue was then ſo thick that ſhe could hardly ſwallow any thing. She was then anointed with <hi>holy oil:</hi> But before, ſhe ſaid to Mr. <hi>Meriel, Why have you not yet, ſir, forgiven my ſins?</hi> In the night following, that <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> were continually by her; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times praying to GOD in her name, and praying to the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and other <hi>ſaints.</hi> She ſaid alſo, <hi>I believe all: I am very glad Chriſt was offered to his Father for me.</hi> Six or ſeven hours before ſhe died, a crucifix was ſhowed to her by Mr. <hi>Dubiſon;</hi> ſhe took it and laid it upon her

heart, and kiſſed it; and then the Nuns hanged it, with a pair of beads, upon her neck. A little before ſhe died, Mr. <hi>Dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> aſked her to pray for him in heaven; ſhe promiſed him: So ſhe gave up the ghoſt on the 27th of November, at ten of the clock, whilſt the high <hi>maſs</hi> was ſaying; ſhe was ſoon commended to the prayers. On the fourth day of the week following ſhe was buried, after the <hi>maſs</hi> had been ſaid for her: She was laid by <hi>Abigail Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet."</hi>

                     <p>I HAVE here tranſcribed the letter in the very words of it, without the leaſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration: The ſame in ſubſtance was ſent to ſeveral other captives. When I had this letter, I preſently knew it to be of Mr. <hi>Meriel'</hi>s compoſing; but the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger who brought the letter, brought word that my ſon had embraced their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Afterwards, when ſome blamed him for letting me know of it, becauſe (they ſaid) they feared my ſorrow would ſhorten my days; he told me he thought with himſelf, that if he was in my caſe, he ſhould be willing to know the worſt, and therefore told me as he would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to have known if in my place. I
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:039104_0083_1013C32D6EBF1638"/>
thanked him, acknowledging it a favour to let me know of it: But the news was ready to overwhelm me with grief and ſorrow. <hi>I made my complaint to GOD, and mourned before him; ſorrow and anguiſh took hold upon me.</hi> I aſked of GOD, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect me what to do, and how to write, and find out an opportunity of conveying a letter to him; and committed this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to his providence. I now found a greater oppoſition to a patient, quiet, humble reſignation to the will of GOD, than I ſhould otherwiſe have known, if not ſo tried. Here I thought of my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions and trials; <hi>my wife</hi> and <hi>two chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren killed,</hi> and <hi>many of my neighbors;</hi> and <hi>myſelf,</hi> and <hi>ſo many of my children and friends</hi> in a <hi>Popiſh captivity,</hi> ſeparated from our children, not capable to come to them to inſtruct them in the way they ought to go; and cunning, crafty enemies, uſing all their ſubtilty to inſinuate into young ones, ſuch principles as would be perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. I thought with myſelf how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py many others were, in that they had their children with them, under all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to bring them up in the <hi>nurture and admonition of the Lord;</hi> whilſt we
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:039104_0084_1013C389033E5668"/>
were ſeparated one from another, and our children in great peril of embracing dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable doctrines. Oh! that all parents who read this hiſtory, would bleſs GOD for the advantages they have of educating their children, and faithfully improve it! I mourned when I thought with myſelf, that I had one child with the <hi>Macquas,</hi> a ſecond turned to <hi>Popery,</hi> and a little child of ſix years of age, in danger from a child to be inſtructed in <hi>Popery;</hi> and knew full well, that all endeavours would be uſed to prevent my ſeeing or ſpeaking with them. But in the midſt of all theſe, GOD gave me a ſecret hope, that he would magnify his power and free grace, and diſappoint all their crafty deſigns. <hi>When I looked on the right hand, and on the left, all refuge failed, and none ſhewed any care for my ſoul.</hi> But GOD brought that word to uphold me, <hi>who is able to do exceeding abundantly above what we can aſk or think.</hi> As alſo that, <hi>Is any thing too hard for God?</hi> I pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to GOD to direct me; and wrote very ſhort the firſt time, and in general terms, fearing leſt if I ſhould write about things in controverſy, my letter would come to him.

I perſuade myſelf you have done it through ignorance. Oh! why have you neglected to aſk a father's advice in an affair of ſo great importance as the change of religion: GOD knows that the <hi>catechiſm</hi> in which I inſtructed you, is according to the WORD of GOD; and ſo will be ſound in the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                           <p>I HAVE waited till now for an anſwer from you, hoping to hear from you, why you made an abjuration of the <hi>Proteſtant Faith</hi> for the <hi>Romiſh.</hi> But ſince you continue to neglect to write to me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, as you neglected to take any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice or counſel from a father, when you did it; I cannot forbear writing again, and making ſome reflections on the letter you wrote me laſt, about the two women. It ſeems to me, from thoſe words of <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gail Turbet'</hi>s in your letter, or rather of Mr. <hi>Meriel'</hi>s, which you tranſcribed for him. ["<hi>Abigail Turbet</hi> ſent for Mr. <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iel,</hi> ſhe committed her ſoul into his hand,
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:039104_0088_1013BE96DA61C0F0"/>
and was ready to do whatever he pleaſed."] I ſay, it ſeems rational to believe, that ſhe had not the uſe of her reaſon; it is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion to be abhorred by all who have any true ſenſe of religion. Was Mr. <hi>Meriel</hi> a GOD, a CHRIST? Could he bear to hear ſuch words and not reject them; replying, 'Don't commit your ſoul into my hands, but ſee that you commit your ſoul into the hands of GOD through Chriſt Jeſus, and do whatever GOD commands you in his holy word: As for me, I am a creature, and cannot ſave your ſoul, but will tell you of <hi>Acts</hi> iv. 12. <hi>Neither is there ſalvation in any other; for there is no other name under heaven given among men, whereby we muſt be ſaved.</hi> Had he been a faithful miniſter of JESUS CHRIST, he would have ſaid, <hi>It is an honour due to</hi> CHRIST <hi>alone.</hi> The holy apoſtle ſays, <hi>Now unto him that is able to keep you, and preſent you faultleſs before the preſence of his glory, with exceeding joy, to the only wiſe</hi> GOD <hi>our ſaviour, be glory and majeſty, dominion and power, both now and ever, amen,</hi> Jude 24, 25, verſes. As to what you write a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout praying to the <hi>virgin Mary,</hi> and oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſaints, I make this reply; Had Mr. <hi>Meriel</hi> done his duty, he would have ſaid to them, as 1 <hi>Job,</hi> ii. 1, 2, <hi>If any man ſin,
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:039104_0089_1013C33821542A60"/>
we have an advocate with the Father,</hi> JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST <hi>the righteous; and he is the propitiation of our ſins.</hi> The ſcriptures ſay, <hi>There is one God, and one mediator between God and man, the man</hi> CHRIST JESUS. Yea, Chriſt ſaid, Go and preach, <hi>He that believeth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> The apoſtle in <hi>Gal.</hi> i. 8, ſaith, <hi>But though we or an angel from heaven preach any other goſpel unto you, than that we have preached to you, let him be accurſed.</hi> They never preached that we ſhould pray to the <hi>virgin Mary,</hi> or other ſaints. As you would be ſaved, hear what the apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> iv. 13, &amp;c. <hi>Neither is there any creature that is not manifeſt in his ſight; but all things are naked, and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do. Seeing then that we have a great High Prieſt that is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into heaven,</hi> JESUS <hi>the ſon of God, let us hold faſt our profeſſion: For we have not an high Prieſt that cannot be touched with the feelings of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without ſin; let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.</hi> Which words do hold forth, how that CHRIST JESUS is in every reſpect qualified to be a <hi>media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>

and <hi>interceſſor;</hi> and I am ſure they cannot be applied to any mere creature, to make them capable of our religious truſt. When <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> have ſaid all they can, they are not able to prove, that the ſaints in heaven have a knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of prayers which are directed to them. Some ſay, they know them one way, others ſay, they have the knowledge of them in another way; and that which they have fixed upon as moſt probable to them, is, That they know of them from their beholding the face of GOD; Seeing GOD, they know theſe prayers; But this is a great miſtake. Tho' the ſaints ſee and know GOD in a glorious manner, yet they have not an infinite knowledge; and it does no ways follow, that becauſe they ſee GOD, they know all prayers that are directed to them upon the earth. And GOD has no where in his word told us, that the ſaints have ſuch a knowledge. Beſides, were it a thing poſſible for them to have a knowledge of what prayers are directed to them, it does not follow that they are to be prayed to, or have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious honour conferred upon them. The <hi>Romaniſts</hi> can neither give one ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture precept or example for praying to
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:039104_0091_1013C33F76DB07A0"/>
them; but GOD has provided a <hi>mediator,</hi> who knows all our petitions, and is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and merciful enough; and we have both ſcripture, precept and example, to look to him as our <hi>mediator</hi> and <hi>advocate</hi> with the Father. Further, it cannot be proved that it is conſiſtent with the ſaints being creatures, as well as with their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, to have a knowledge of prayers from all parts of the world at the ſame time, from many millions together, about things ſo vaſtly differing one from anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and then to preſent thoſe ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for all that look to them, is not hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility but will-worſhip. <hi>Col.</hi> ii. 18, <hi>Let no man beguile you of your reward, in a vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untary humility, worſhipping of Angels,</hi> ver. 23, <hi>Which things indeed have a ſhew of wiſdom and will-worſhip and humility.</hi> For what humility can it be, to diſtruſt the way that GOD has provided and encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged us to come to him in, and impoſe upon GOD a way of our own deviſing? Was not GOD angry with <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> for impoſing upon him after ſuch a ſort? I <hi>Kings,</hi> xii. 33, <hi>So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel, the fifth day of the eighth month, which he deviſed of his own heart.</hi> Therefore CHRIST ſaith,

                              <hi>Mark,</hi> vii. 7, <hi>Howbeit, in vain do they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip me, teaching for doctrines the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men.</hi> Before the coming of Chriſt and his entering into heaven as an <hi>interceſſor; (Heb.</hi> vii. 25, <hi>Wherefore he is able to ſave them to the uttermoſt that come to God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them;)</hi> I ſay before Chriſt's entering into heaven as an <hi>interceſſor,</hi> not one word of any prayer to ſaints: What reaſon can be given that now there is need of ſo many ſaints to make interceſſion; when Chriſt as a <hi>Prieſt</hi> is entered into heaven to make interceſſion for us? The anſwer that the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> give is a very fable and falſehood; <abbr>viz.</abbr> that there were no ſaints in heaven, till after the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and aſcenſion of Chriſt, but were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in a place called <hi>Limbus Patrum,</hi> and ſo had not the beatifieal viſion. See <hi>Gen.</hi> v. 24, <hi>Enoch walked with God and was not, for God took him.</hi> If he was not taken into heaven, what can be the ſenſe of thoſe words, <hi>For God took him?</hi> Again, 2 <hi>Kings,</hi> ii. I, When the LORD would take up <hi>Elijah</hi> into heaven by a whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind, ver. II, <hi>There appeared a chariot of fire, and horſes of fire, and parted them both aſunder, and Elijah went up by a whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:039104_0093_1013C341B1209960"/>
into heaven.</hi> Muſt the truth of the ſcripture be called in queſtion to uphold their notions? Beſides, it is not conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with reaſon to ſuppoſe, that <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> inſtead of having a peculiar privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege vouchſafed to them, for their eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in holineſs, ſhould be leſs happy for ſo long a time than the reſt of the ſaints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed, who are glorified in heaven; which muſt be, if they are yet kept, and muſt be till the day of judgment, out of heaven, and the beatifical viſion, in an earthly paradiſe, according to ſome of the <hi>Romaniſts;</hi> or in ſome other place they know not where, according to others. Religious worſhip is not to be given to the creature, <hi>Mat.</hi> iv. 9, 10, and ſaith, <hi>All theſe things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me:</hi> Then ſaith <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> to him, <hi>Get thee hence Satan, for it is written, Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> That phraſe, <hi>and him only ſhalt thou ſerve,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all creatures, <hi>Rev.</hi> xxii. 8, 9, <hi>I fell down to worſhip before, the feet of the Angel, which ſhewed me theſe things; then ſaith he to me, ſee thou do it not, for I am thy fellow ſervant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the ſayings
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:039104_0094_1013C3948E272F28"/>
of this book, worſhip God.</hi> Which plainly ſhews, that GOD only is to be worſhipped with a religious worſhip. None can think that St. <hi>John</hi> intended to give the higheſt divine worſhip to the angel, who ſaith, do not fall down and worſhip me; it is GOD'S due, <hi>worſhip God.</hi> So Acts x. 25, 26, <hi>As Peter was coming in, Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius met him and fell down at his feet and worſhipped him, but Peter took him up, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſtand up, I myſelf alſo am a man.</hi> See alſo Lev. xix. 10. The words of the ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ond commandment (which the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> either leave out, or add to the firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, ſaying, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er gods before me,</hi> adding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) I ſay, the words of the ſecond commandment are, <hi>Thou ſhalt not make to thyſelf any graven im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, or any likeneſs of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the waters under the earth; thou ſhalt not bow down thyſelf to them, nor ſerve them, for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe words being inſerted in the letter, that came from your brother <hi>Eleazer</hi> in <hi>New-England</hi> the laſt ſummer, was the cauſe of the letter's being ſent down from <hi>Montreal,</hi> and not given to you, when ſo near you, as I ſuppoſe, there

being no other clauſe of the letter that could be objected againſt; and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why found at <hi>Quebeck,</hi> when I ſent it to you a ſecond time, encloſed in a letter written by myſelf. The brazen ſerpent made by divine appointment as a type of CHRIST, when abuſed to ſuperſtition, was by reforming <hi>Hezekiah</hi> broken in pieces. As to what the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> plead about the lawfulneſs of image and ſaint worſhip, from thoſe likeneſſes of things made in <hi>Solomon'</hi>s temple, it is nothing to the purpoſe. We do not ſay it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to make or have a picture, but thoſe carved images were not in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be adored, bowed down to, or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped. There is no manner of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that becauſe there were images made in <hi>Solomon'</hi>s temple that were not adored and worſhipped, that therefore it is now lawful to make and fall down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore images, and pray to them, and ſo worſhip them. Religious worſhipping of ſaints, cannot be defended from, but is forbidden in the ſcriptures: and for fear of loſing their diſciples, the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> keep away from them the Bible, and oblige them to believe as they ſay they muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.

As tho' there was no uſe to be made of our reaſon above our ſouls; and yet the <hi>Bereans</hi> were counted noble, for ſearching the ſcriptures, to ſee whether the things preached by St. <hi>Paul</hi> were ſo or not.

"1 Cor. xi. 1, Now I praiſe you brethren, that you remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances as I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered them to you." Either thoſe ſpok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, <hi>Acts</hi> xv. or in his miniſtry and epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, "2 Cor. ii. 10, For your ſake for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give I it, in the perſon of Chriſt. 2.

Again, you find Peter himſelf ſent forth by the other apoſtles: "Acts viii. 14, The apoſtles ſent unto them Peter and John." When the church of the Jews found fault with Peter for going in to the Gentiles when he went to Cornelius, he does not ſay, Why do you queſtion me, or call me to an account, I am <hi>Chriſt's vicar</hi> on earth. When Paul reproved Peter, Gal. ii. he does not defend himſelf by mentioning an infallibility in himſelf as <hi>Chriſt's vicar,</hi> or reprove Paul for his boldneſs.</p>
                           <p>"The Roman Catholick CHURCH cannot be a true church of Chriſt, in that it makes laws directly contrary to the laws and commands of Chriſt.

Yea, his whole body muſt be now in heaven, and in a thouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and other places, and in the mouth of ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery communicant at the ſame time, and that both as a broken and unbroken ſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifice,
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:039104_0101_1013C34EB026C458"/>
and be ſubject to putrefaction. CHRIST is ſaid to be a <hi>Door,</hi> a <hi>true Vine,</hi> a <hi>Way,</hi> a <hi>Rock.</hi> What work ſhall we make, if we expound theſe in a literal manner, as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> do, when they ſay, <hi>This is my body,</hi> is meant the real <hi>body</hi> of Chriſt in the Euchariſt? It is ſaid, "1 Cor. x. 4, And did all drink of the ſame ſpiritual drink, for they drank of that ſpiritual Rock that followed them, and that rock was Chriſt." Was Chriſt literally a rock, think you? Yea, it is abſurd to believe, that a <hi>Prieſt</hi> uttering a few words over <hi>wafer</hi> not above an inch ſquare, can make it a GOD, or the <hi>body</hi> of CHRIST entire, as it was offered on the croſs. A blaſphemy to pretend to a power of making GOD at their pleaſure, and then eat him, and give him to others to be eaten, or ſhut him up in their altars; that they can utter the ſame words, and make a GOD or not make a GOD, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their intention; and that the people are obliged to believe that it is GOD, and ſo adore it, when they never hear any word of conſecration, nor know the <hi>Prieſt's</hi> intention.</p>
                           <p>As to what you write about the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Maſs, I reply, It is wholly an human
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:039104_0102_1013C3A48C6606C8"/>
invention; not a word of ſuch a ſacrifice in the whole bible; its being a ſacrifice propitiatory daily to be offered, is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the holy ſcriptures. Heb. vii. 27, Who needeth not daily, as thoſe high prieſts, to offer up ſacrifice firſt for his own ſins, and then for the people's: For this he did once when he offered up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And yet the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> ſay, there is need that he be offered up as a ſacrifice to GOD every day. "Heb. ix. 12, By his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us: 25, 26, 27, 28, Nor yet that he ſhould offer himſelf often, as the High Prieſt entereth into the holy place, every year with the blood of others: For then muſt he often have ſuffered ſince the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world: But now once in the end of the world, hath he appeared to put away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf: As it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: So Chriſt was once of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to bear the ſins of many. Heb. x. 10, By which will we are ſanctified, through the offering of the body of Jeſus Chriſt once for all: Ver. 12, But this man, after he had offered one ſacrifice for ſins, forever ſat down on the right hand of
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:039104_0103_1013C35038A74BC0"/>
God: Ver. 14, For by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified." By which ſcripture you may ſee that the <hi>maſs</hi> is not of divine appointment, but an human invention. Their evaſion of a bloody and an unbloody ſacrifice, is a ſham: The holy ſcriptures ſpeak not one word of Chriſt's being offered as a ſacrifice propitiatory, after ſuch a ſort as they call an unbloody ſacrifice. All the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the <hi>maſs</hi> are human inventions, that GOD never commanded.</p>
                           <p>As to what is in the letter about pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the women after their death, is very ridiculous. For, <hi>As the tree falls, ſo it lies;</hi> as <hi>death leaves, judgment will find:</hi> No change after death from an afflicted to an happy place and ſtate. Purgatory is a fancy for the enriching the clergy, and impoveriſhing the laity. The notion of it is a fatal ſnare to many ſouls, who ſin with hopes of eaſily getting prieſtly abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at death, and buying off their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with their money. The ſoul at death goes immediately to judgment, and ſo to heaven or hell. No authentic place of ſcripture mentions ſo much as one word of any ſuch place or ſtate. Mr. <hi>Meriel</hi> told me, "If I found one error in our
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:039104_0104_1013C3A069AD20E0"/>
religion, it was enough to cauſe me to diſown our whole religion:" By his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument you may ſee what reaſon you have to avoid that religion that is ſo full of errors.</p>
                           <p>Bethink yourſelf, and conſult the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, if you can get them: (I mean the bible.) Can you think their religion is right, when they are afraid to let you have an Engliſh bible; or to ſpeak with your father, or other of your chriſtian neighbors, for fear they would give you ſuch convictions of truth, that they cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move? Can that religion be true that cannot bear an examination from the ſcriptures, that are a perfect rule in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith; or that muſt be upheld by ignorance, eſpecially ignorance of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſcriptures?</p>
                           <p>Theſe things have I written as in my heart I believe. I long for your recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, and will not cease to pray for it.

above what I can aſk or think.</hi> Do not give way to diſcouragement as to your return to <hi>New-England:</hi> Read over what I have written, and keep it with you, if you can; you have no friend on earth that wiſheth your eternal ſalvation more heartily than your father. I long to ſee and ſpeak with you, but I never forget you: My love to you, and to your brother, and ſiſter, and to all our fellow priſoners. Let me hear from you as often as you can.

                           <p>There are a great many other things in the letter that deſerve to be refuted, but I ſhould be too tedious in remarking them all at once.

                     <p>THIS <hi>Prieſt,</hi> Mr. <hi>Meriel,</hi> has brought many letters to him, and bid him write them over and ſend them, and ſo he has done for many others. By this, as alſo by Mrs. <hi>Stilſon'</hi>s ſaying, <q>She does not think that either of theſe women did change their religion before their death;</q> and alſo, <q>that oftentimes during their ſickneſs, whilſt they had the uſe of their reaſon, they proteſted againſt the <hi>Romiſh</hi> reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion

and faith,</q> it is evident that theſe women never died <hi>Papiſts,</hi> but that it was a willy ſtratagem of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> to advance their religion, for letters were ſent imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after their death, to uſe this as a perſuaſive argument to gain others; but GOD in his providence gave farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of their fallaciouſneſs in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>For the laſt ſummer, one <hi>Biggilow</hi> from <hi>Marlborough,</hi> a captive at <hi>Montreal,</hi> was very ſick in the hoſpital, and in the judgment of all, with a ſickneſs to death. Then the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and others gave out, that he was turned to be of their religion, and taken into their communion: But contrary to their expectation, he was brought back from the gates of death, and would comply with none of their rites; ſaying, <q>that whilſt he had the uſe of his reaſon, he never ſpake any thing in favor of their religion; and that he never diſowned the <hi>Proteſtant Faith,</hi> nor would he now:</q> So that they were ſilenced and put to ſhame.

in reading the holy ſcriptures: A man of a good underſtanding, a deſirable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.

againſt ours.

After ſome weeks had paſſed in ſuch aſſertions, there came one into my landlord's houſe, affirming it to be a truth reported of <hi>Zebediah;</hi> ſaying, <q>
                           <hi>Joſeph Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly</hi> had been over the river and told one of our neighbors this ſtory,</q> After a few hours I ſaw that neighbor, and aſked him, whether he had ſeen <hi>Egerly</hi> lately? he ſaid, Yes; What news told he you?

                        </q> And ſays he to me, <q>One day I was ſitting in the houſe, and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly</hi> came in, and I ſpake to him before the whole family, (in the <hi>French</hi> tongue, for he could not ſpeak much <hi>Engliſh</hi>) and aſked him of this ſtory:</q> He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>It is a great falſehood,</hi> ſaying, <hi>he never appeared to me, nor have I ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported any ſuch thing to any body; and that he had never been at the maſs ſince</hi> Zebedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah's <hi>death.</hi> At the hearing of which, they

were ſilenced and put to ſhame. We bleſſed GOD together, for diſcovering their wickedneſs, and diſappointing them in what they aimed at; and prayed to GOD to deliver us and all the captives from deluſions, and recover them who had fallen, and ſo parted. After which I took my pen and wrote a letter to one <hi>Samuel Hill,</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> captive, taken from <hi>Wells,</hi> who lived at <hi>Quebeck,</hi> and his brother <hi>Ebenezer Hill,</hi> to make a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of this lying plot, to warn them of their danger, and aſſure them of the falſhood of this report; but the letter fell into the hands of the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and was nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er delivered.

                     <p>In the latter end of ſummer, they told me, <q>they had news from <hi>New-England,</hi> by one who had been a captive at <hi>Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> who ſaid that the miniſters at <hi>Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> had told the <hi>French</hi> captives, that the <hi>proteſtant religion</hi> was the only true religion; and that as a confirmation of it, they would raiſe a dead perſon to life before their eyes, for their convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that having perſuaded one to
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:039104_0116_1013C3B64CEEA758"/>
feign himſelf dead, they came and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over him, and then commanded him <hi>in the name of Chriſt</hi> (whoſe religion they kept pure) to ariſe; they called and commanded, but he never aroſe; ſo that inſtead of raiſing the dead, they killed the living, which the bereaved relations diſcovered.</q> I told them, <q>
                           <hi>It was an old lie and calumny againſt</hi> Luther <hi>and</hi> Calvin, <hi>new vamped, and that they only change the perſons and place;</hi>
                        </q> but they affirmed it to be a truth; I told them, <q>
                           <hi>I wondered they were ſo fond of a faith prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agated, and then maintained by lying words.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>We were always out of hopes of being returned before winter, the ſeaſon prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo cold the latter end of September, and were praying to GOD to prepare our hearts with an holy ſubmiſſion to his holy will, to glorify his holy name in a way of paſſive obedience, in the winter. For my own part, I was informed by ſeveral who came from the city, that the <hi>Lord Intendant</hi> ſaid, if <hi>More</hi> returned, and brought word that <hi>Battis</hi> was in priſon, he would put me in priſon, and lay me in irons. They would not permit me to go into the city, ſaying, <hi>I always did harm
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:039104_0117_1013C36A025D06B8"/>
when I came to the city,</hi> and if at any time I was at the city, they would perſuade the governor to ſend me back again.</p>
                     <p>In the beginning of laſt June, the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> came to the pariſh where I was, and told me, <q>He ſaw I wanted my friend, captain <hi>de Beauville,</hi> and that I was ragged:</q> But ſays he, <q>Your obſtinacy againſt our religion, diſcourages us from providing better clothes;</q> I told him, <q>
                           <hi>It was better go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a ragged coat, than with a ragged conſcience.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the beginning of laſt June, went out an army of five hundred <hi>Macquas</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> with an intention to have fallen on ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> towns down <hi>Connecticut riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> but lighting on a <hi>Scatacook Indian,</hi> who afterwards ran away in the night, they were diſcouraged; ſaying, <hi>He would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm the whole country.</hi> About fifty, as ſome ſay, or eighty, as others, returned: Thus GOD reſtrained their wrath.</p>
                     <p>When they were promiſing themſelves another winter, to draw away the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to <hi>Popery,</hi> news came that an <hi>Engliſh</hi> brigantine was coming; and that the honourable Capt. <hi>Samuel Appleton,</hi> 
                        <abbr>Eſq.</abbr> was coming ambaſſador, to fetch off the
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:039104_0118_1013C3B909474E20"/>
captives, and Capt. <hi>John Bonner</hi> with him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I cannot tell you how the clergy and oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, laboured to ſtop many of the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: To ſome <hi>liberty,</hi> to ſome <hi>money,</hi> and <hi>yearly penſions</hi> were offered, if they would ſtay. Some they urged to tarry at leaſt till the ſpring of the year; telling them, it was ſo late in the year, they would be loſt by ſhipwreck, if they went now; ſome younger ones they told, if they went home they would be damned and burnt in hell forever, to affright them; day and night they were urging them to ſtay. And I was threatened to be ſent aboard, without a permiſſion to come aſhore again, if I ſhould again diſcourſe with any of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who were turned to their religion: At <hi>Montreal</hi> eſpecially, all crafty endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours were uſed to ſtay the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> They told my child, if he would ſtay, he ſhould have an honourable penſion from the king every year, and that his maſter, who was and old man, and the richeſt in <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ada,</hi> would give him a great deal; telling him if he returned, he would be poor, for (ſaid they) your father is poor, has loſt all his eſtate, it was all burnt; but he would not be prevailed with to ſtay. And others were alſo in like manner urged to
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:039104_0119_1013C36FD5956BD0"/>
ſtay; but God graciouſly brake the ſnare, and brought them out. They endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Fall of the year, to prevail with my ſon to go to <hi>France,</hi> when they ſaw he would not come to their communion any more. One woman belonging to the eaſtern parts, who had by their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions, married an <hi>Engliſh</hi> captive taken the laſt war, came away with her huſband, which made them ſay, they were ſorry they ever perſuaded her to turn to their religion, and then to marry; for inſtead of advancing their cauſe by it, they had weakened it; for now they had not only loſt her, but another they thought they had made ſure of. Another woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the eaſtward, who had been flattered to their religion, to whom a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was denied till ſhe promiſed to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace their religion, and then had the promiſe of it for a little time; opening her Bible whilſt in the church and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent at <hi>maſs,</hi> ſhe read the fourth chapter of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> and received ſuch conviction whilſt reading, that before her firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion ſhe fell off from them, and could never be prevailed with any more to be of their religion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="122" facs="unknown:039104_0120_1013C3BBDDEACC58"/>
We have reaſon to bleſs GOD, who has wrought deliverance for ſo many; and yet pray to GOD for a door of eſcape, to be opened for the great number yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, not much ſhort of an hundred; many of which are children, and of theſe not a few among the ſavages, and having forgot the <hi>Engliſh</hi> tongue, will be loſt, and turn ſavages alſo in a little time, unleſs ſomething extraordinary prevent.</p>
                     <p>The veſſel that came for us, in its voyage to <hi>Canada,</hi> ſtruck on a bar of ſands, and there lay in very great hazard for four tides; and yet they ſaw reaſon to bleſs GOD for ſtriking there; for had they got over that bar, they would at midnight in a ſtorm of ſnow, have run upon a terrible ledge of rocks.</p>
                     <p>We came away from <hi>Quebeck,</hi> October 25; and by contrary winds, and a great ſtorm, we were retarded, and then driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en back nigh the city, and had a great deliverance from ſhipwreck, the veſſel ſtriking twice on a rock in that ſtorm. But through GOD's goodneſs, we all arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſafety at <hi>Boſton,</hi> November 21; the number of captives, fifty ſeven, two of which were my children. I have yet a daughter of ten years of age, and many

neighbours, whoſe caſe beſpeaks your compaſſion, and prayers to GOD, to gath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er them, being out caſts ready to periſh.</p>
                     <p>At our arrival at <hi>Boſton,</hi> we found the kindneſſes of the Lord in a wonderful manner, in GOD'S opening the hearts of many, to bleſs GOD with us and for us; wonderfully to give for our ſupplies in our needy ſtate. We are under obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to praiſe GOD, for diſpoſing of the hearts of ſo many to ſo great charity; and under great bonds to pray for a bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the heads, hearts and families of them, who ſo liberally and plentifully gave for our relief. It is certain, that the charity of the whole country of <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> though moved with the doctrine of merit, does not come up to the charity of <hi>Boſton</hi> alone, where notions of merits are rejected; but acts of charity performed out of a right chriſtian ſpirit, from a ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it of thankfulneſs to GOD, out of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to GOD'S command, and unfeigned love and charity to them that are of the ſame family and houſehold of faith. The Lord grant, that all who deviſe ſuch liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al things, may find the accompliſhment of the promiſes made by GOD, in their

own perſons and theirs after them, from generation to generation.</p>
                     <p>I SHALL annex a ſhort account, of the troubles beginning to ariſe in <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ada.</hi> On May 16, arrived a canoe at <hi>Quebeck,</hi> that brought letters from <hi>Miſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſippi,</hi> written the May preceding; giving an account that the plague was there, and that one hundred and fifty <hi>French</hi> in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little time had died of it; and that the ſavages, called the <hi>Lezilouways</hi> were very turbulent, and had with their arrows wounded a <hi>Jeſuit</hi> in five places, and killed a <hi>Frenchman</hi> that waited on him. In Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, news came, that the nations up the river were engaged in a war, one againſt the other; and that the <hi>French</hi> living ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and trading with them, were in great danger; that the <hi>Mitchel Macqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> had made war with the <hi>Mizianmies,</hi> and had killed a <hi>Mendicant Friar,</hi> and three other <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> and eleven <hi>ſavages,</hi> at a place called the <hi>Straits,</hi> where they are ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling a garriſon and place for traffic; the <hi>Michel Macquinas</hi> had taken ſixteen <hi>Frenchmen</hi> priſoners, and burnt their trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing houſes. Theſe tidings made the <hi>French</hi> very full of perplexing troubles;
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:039104_0123_1013C374CC56C0A0"/>
but the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> are endeavouring to paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy them; but the troubles when we came away, were rather increaſing than leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for the laſt letters from the <hi>French</hi> priſoners at <hi>Michel Macquina,</hi> report, That the ſavages had ſent out two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, one of an hundred and fifty, the other of an hundred and ſixty, againſt the ſavages at the <hi>Straits;</hi> and they fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they would engage as well againſt the <hi>French</hi> as the <hi>Indians.</hi>

                  <p>A SERMON, PREACHED AT BOSTON LECTURE, Dec. 5, 1706; BY JOHN WILLIAMS, Paſtor of the CHURCH of CHRIST in <hi>Deer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> ſoon after his return from captivity.</p>

                        <hi>Return to thine own houſe, and ſhew how great things GOD hath done unto thee.—</hi>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THE infinitely wiſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer of all things, who aims at his own glory, in the governing of rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, doth ſometimes bring perſons into the depths of diſtreſs; and then magnify
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:039104_0125_1013C3C2967E02C8"/>
his power and grace in raiſing, them up out of their afflictions: And in many, reſpects by ſuch things, he has a deſign of advancing his own glory in the world. We find in the context, a perſon in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry doleful, diſtreſſed condition: He ſeems to be forſaken of GOD, and made a poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and dwelling place of evil ſpirits, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of all human comforts, made to poſſeſs ſorrow and pain to ſuch a degree, as to be a common ſubject, or a theme of diſcourſe for all men to relate doleful things about. And afterward, GOD in very remarkable and wonderful works of power and mercy, not only gives releaſe from his ſorrowful poſſeſſion, but he is <hi>ſitting at the feet of Jeſus, clothed, and in his right mind.</hi> Now this was done for the manifeſt glory of GOD. For when this man (for whom ſuch great things had been done) petitions Chriſt that he may abide with him, to hear from him, and pay his reſpects to him; he receives commandment, to glorify the power and mercy of GOD, in declaring to others what great things GOD had done for him.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A ſubject of great mercy; or a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſpoken of for whom GOD had done great things, beſtowed eminent mercies.</p>

                     <pb n="129" facs="unknown:039104_0126_1013C37E0AA48490"/>
2. A particular and ſpecial command from Chriſt, to glorify GOD in relating to others, what mercies he had been the ſubject of.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. His obedience to the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt. He went and publiſhed the great things done for him by Chriſt; ſo that from the command of Chriſt, and his obedience to it, for which he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, you may obſerve this doctrinal concluſion.</p>
                  <div type="doctrine">
                     <head>DOCT. It well becomes thoſe who have had eminent mercies, to ſhew to others what great things GOD has done for them.</head>
                     <p>The holy ſcriptures in many places confirm this truth. See Exod. xii. 25, 26, 27, <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs, when ye be come to the land, which the Lord will give you, according as he hath promiſed, that ye ſhall keep this ſervice. And it ſhall come to paſs, when your children ſhall ſay unto you, What mean you by this ſervice, that ye ſhall ſay, It is the ſacrifice of the Lord's paſſover, who paſſed over the houſes of the children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael in Egypt, when he ſmote the Egyptians, and delivered our houſes.</hi> Exod. xiii. 8, 10, <hi>And thou ſhalt ſhew thy ſon in that day, ſaying,
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:039104_0127_1013C3C452D31F50"/>
This is done becauſe of that which the Lord did unto me, when I came forth out of Egypt. Thou ſhalt therefore keep this ordinance in his ſeaſon from year to year.</hi> Pſal. lxxviii. 3, 4, <hi>Which we have heard and known, and our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have told us; we will not hide them from their children, ſhewing to the generation to come the praiſes of the Lord, and his ſtrength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.</hi> In the proſecution and handling of this truth, conſider,</p>
                     <p>I. They who have had mercies, have had them from GOD. God is the beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and giver of all our good things: All our mercies come to us by a divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and ordering; not by caſualty or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident: Neither are they of our own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing and purchaſing, or others, ſo as to exclude the providential diſpoſing of God. 'Tis God who returns the captivity of Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Pſal.cxxvi, <hi>beg. When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream: Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with ſinging. Then ſaid they among the heathen, The Lord hath done great things for them. The Lord hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad: Turn again our captivity, O Lord.</hi> The very Heathen acknowledge the
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:039104_0128_1013C4177122E350"/>
good things beſtowed upon, and done for the church, to be from God; and God's own people acknowledge him for the mercies granted, and humbly ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate mercies from him for the future. 'Tis God who gathers the outcaſts of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> 'Tis he who takes away the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the mighty, the prey of the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible: Who contends with them that contend with us, and ſaves our children, 'Tis God who diſperſeth and gathers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: Therefore the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> ciii. <hi>begin.</hi> calls upon his ſoul to bleſs the Lord, and not to forget all his benefits; and ſaith, 'tis God <hi>who forgiveth all thy iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, who healeth all thy diſeaſes: Who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed thy life from deſtruction, who crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thee with loving kindneſs and tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> &amp;c. Sometimes, God in a more immediate and extraordinary way and manner confers bleſſings and mercies, ſometimes in a more ordinary and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate way; but his providence is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged in all: Not one ſingle mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy comes to us, without a commiſſion from that God by whom our very hairs are numbered.</p>
                     <p>II. It well becomes thoſe who have had eminent mercies, to ſhew to others
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:039104_0129_1013C3C965811AD0"/>
what great things God hath done for them. Therefore you find the holy Pſalmiſt calling upon others, to give a liſtening ear, whilſt he makes a narration of the ſalvations he had from God, Pſal. lxvi. 16, <hi>Come and bear all you that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my ſoul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1<hi>ſt. Reaſon.</hi> Becauſe God aimed at the advancement of his own glory, in the giving and dealing out of theſe mercies. God makes and diſpoſeth all things for his own glory. All works of Providence, are ſome way or other to advance the glory of God in the world. The glory of his power, wiſdom, mercy juſtice and holineſs, are ſome way or other advanced in a manifeſtive way and manner. Now it well becomes us, to fall in with the deſign of God, and in an active manner to give him glory. That God deſigns to have glory given to him is evident from Pſal. 1. 15, <hi>And call upon me in the day of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I will deliver thee, and thou ſhalt glorify me.</hi> Exod. vii. 5, <hi>And the Egyptians ſhall know that I am the Lord, when I ſtretch forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Iſrael from among them.</hi> God has a deſign to magnify his power, mercy
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:039104_0130_1013C418F6674EA0"/>
and covenant faithfulneſs, in the eyes of the world.</p>
                     <p n="2">2<hi>d. Reas.</hi> Becauſe God has given us direct precepts, and poſitive commands, in this way to glorify him. <hi>God is our Lord and lawgiver,</hi> and he requires that among other ways of ſhowing forth his praiſes, we do it by rehearſing his praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy acts to the children of men. So that in obedience to God, and anſwering that high and noble end we were made for, it is requiſite that in this way we glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify God. It is enough, that the great God who hath taken us into <hi>covenant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> to himſelf, has enjoined us to ſhew forth his praiſes in rehearſing to others the ſalvations and favours we have been the ſubjects of. The before mentioned ſcriptures, with many others that might be enumerated, ſufficiently demonſtrate, that God calls for our thankful acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edgments in this way; and upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this being ſo agreeable to the revealed and preceptive will of God, the Pſalmiſt expreſſes himſelf as in Pſal. cxlv. 4, 5, 6, <hi>One generation ſhall praiſe thy works to another, and ſhall declare thy mighty acts. I will ſpeak of the glorious honour of thy maj<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſty
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:039104_0131_1013C3CC99CFD960"/>
and of thy wondrous works. And men ſhall ſpeak of the might of thy terrible acts; and I will declare thy greatneſs. They ſhall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodneſs; and ſhall ſing of thy righteouſneſs:</hi> Verſe 10, 11, 12, <hi>All thy works ſhall praiſe thee, O Lord; and thy ſaints ſhall bleſs thee. They ſhall ſpeak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power. To make known to the ſons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majeſty of his kingdom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3<hi>d. Reas.</hi> Becauſe hereby they will ſtir up others to bleſs God with them, and for them. A truly gracious ſoul finds by experience, that he can do but a little in glorifying God, finds how far he falls ſhort of the rule of duty, in ſo reaſonable a ſervice as glorifying God: And being enlarged in deſires that the glory due to God might be given him, doth call upon others to join with him in his heavenly ſervice of praiſing God; and therefore tells them what great things God has done. Pſal. xxxiv. 2, 3, 4, 6, <hi>My ſoul ſhall make her boaſt in the Lord; the humble ſhall hear thereof, and be glad. O magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together. I ſought the Lord and he heard me; and delivered me from all my

fears. This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and ſaved him out of all his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</hi> When <hi>Moſes</hi> told his father in law <hi>Jethro,</hi> the great things God had done for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he glorifies God on their behalf. Ex. xviii. 8, &amp;c. <hi>And Moſes told his fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in law all that the Lord had done unto Pharaoh, and to the Egyptians for Iſrael's ſake, and all the travel that had come upon them by the way, and how the Lord deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodneſs which the Lord had done to Iſrael, whom he had delivered out of the hands of the Egyptians. And Jethro ſaid, Bleſſed be the Lord, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians. Now I know that the Lord is greater than all Gods, for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly, he was above them.</hi> By this means thanks will be given to God by many: As ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have been praying to God for them, ſo many will be praiſing and bleſſing God with them and for them.</p>

And therefore in obedience to GOD'S command, that you may be under advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to glorify God; I will now make a report of ſome of the great things God has done for thoſe you have been putting

up ſo many prayers to God for. God has eminently been fulfilling that word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> cvi, 46, <hi>He made them alſo to be pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ied, of all thoſe that carried them captives.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>God hath made thoſe whoſe characters have been, that they were ſuch whoſe tender mercies were cruelties; ſuch from whom, one act of pity or compaſſion could ſcarce be expected, even ſuch who have delighted in cruelty; to pity and compaſſionate ſuch who were led into captivity by them. Made them bear on their arms, and carry on their ſhoulders our little ones, unable to travel. Feed their priſoners with the beſt of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions: Yea, ſometimes pinch them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as to their daily food, rather than their captives. To pity them under ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and afford all proper means for the reſtoration of their health, or recovery from lameneſs. Made heathen's bowels yearn towards poor infants expoſed to death, ſo as to work out their deliverance from fatal ſtrokes, by burdening them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Oh! let us adore the riches of the grace of God, who in wrath remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers mercy, and doth not ſtir up all his wrath; and from hence be encouraged, when under convictions of God's being
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:039104_0138_1013C422D2FDA608"/>
angry with us, yet to look to him for mercy.</p>
                     <p>God has upheld many poor ſouls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all manner of diſadvantages, as to getting knowledge, and kept them from falling, though crafty adverſaries were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all advantages, and painful endeavours uſed to ſeduce them. Being without bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, miniſters or chriſtian friends to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with, daily harraſſed with temptations and tempters: Some threatened, ſome flattered, ſome ſhut up and confined in <hi>Monaſteries,</hi> where no means were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſayed to gain them to change their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                     <p>God has ſtrengthened them to go thro' tedious journeys, and renewed ſtrength, when they were even fainting in their ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its; thinking it not poſſible to travel five miles, and yet enabled to travel at leaſt forty in a day. Remarkably ordering ſeaſons, ſo as to be for their comfort in their travels; cauſing a moiſt ſnow to fall on the lake, only to ſuch a height as to make it eaſy to their ſwoln and wounded feet: Changing the winds for their advantages, in petty voyages in their tickliſh canoes.</p>
                     <p>They have found God a little ſanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to them, in the land of ſtrangers: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:039104_0139_1013C3DB5E164D10"/>
there they have found the conſolations of God through Chriſt not to be ſmall, ſo that ſome of the moſt joyful and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing favors from heaven, have been given into their ſouls, when under all ſorts of outward afflictions.</p>
                     <p>They have found God, a God hearing prayers, when they have gone to him with their moſt difficult caſes; preſerving them from falling; recovering them form falls; to making void the counſels of adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, diſappointing them in the things they dealt moſt proudly in. God has brought his to a reſignation to his will, and then appeared dealing out mercies, as the very caſe did require.</p>
                     <p>God has ſanctified to ſome, their form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſabbath ſolemn attendances on duties of piety, private as well as public; and a religious education to be an unanſwerable objection againſt ſuch who were zealous for the <hi>traditions of men,</hi> to a viſible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faning God's ſabbaths. They durſt not embrace that religion, the principles of which, as well as practiſes, were ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the precepts of God's holy wrod.

duly ſanctified by all under their charge; and that they would be exemplary before others, in a due obſervance of holy time.</p>
                     <p>God has made the falls of ſome to <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi> a means for the recovery of others; and making thoſe things, by which the adverſary thought to increaſe their numbers and proſelytes, to be occaſional of recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch who from their youth had been educated in the <hi>Popiſh</hi> way; having been taken captives when young. Do not be diſcouraged and ſay, your friends and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have (being captivated when young) for a long time lived in <hi>Popery,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no hopes of recovery; for God can make dry bones, very dry, to live, and can in ways unthought of by you, both recover them after they have fallen, and return them again. The adverſaries have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times pretended <hi>miracles</hi> for the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their religion, that they might ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to <hi>Popery;</hi> in fallacious ways cauſed reports that ſome captives died <hi>Papiſts;</hi> that one appeared in flames of fire to bear a teſtimony againſt the <hi>Proteſtant Religion;</hi> but God has in his wiſe providence, made known their falſehoods and lies.</p>
                     <p>They have ſought to perſuade ſome, by ſums of money, to change their religion,
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:039104_0141_1013C3DCFA01EA20"/>
offering honour and advancement to them at the ſame time; but God enabled them to reſiſt and hate ſuch allurements.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>God has made ſome with an heroical, yea with a right chriſtian courage, to wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come death. Oh let every one get ſuch a preparedneſs for DEATH, that a ſudden DEATH may not be a terror!</p>
                     <p>God has made ſome by the want of ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary mercies, to ſet an higher value upon the ordinances of JESUS CHRIST. Oh learn to prize and improve them, leſt God teach you by the briars and thorns of the wilderneſs, the worth of them, and make you weep when you ſet down at the rivers of <hi>Babylon.</hi>

                     <p>God has ſtrengthened ſome to ſtand, when they have not only been threatened with all cruelties if they refuſed, but when the hatchet has been lift up, with a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening of ſpeedy death in caſe of refuſal.

4. The <hi>Fall fight</hi> (as it is called,) was on <hi>May</hi> 18, 1676, when a great ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was made of the enemy, but Capt. <hi>Turner</hi> and 37 men were loſt. There were many remarkables, relating to this affair, (as related by <hi>Jonathan Wells,</hi> 
                        <abbr>Eſq.</abbr> who was preſent) which are not taken notice of by Mr. <hi>Hubbard,</hi> or Dr. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>

                  <head>APPENDIX. By the Rev. JOHN TAYLOR, the preſent Miniſter of the Goſpel, in Deerfield; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſome account of the miſchief done by the enemy, in Deerfield, and its vicin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, from the death of the Rev. Mr. WILLIAMS, to the concluſion of the laſt French War.</head>
                  <p>THE readers of this Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix, will probably feel deſirous of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reaſons, why, in many things, I have been ſo general; only having given a brief ſtatement of facts; and in others, have been more particular. I truſt, it will be a ſufficient apology to obſerve, That I have done it for the want of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter documents. Moſt of the facts men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, I have taken from the minutes of ſome gentlemen, who kept them, only for their own ſatisfaction, and were not particular; and now, the diſtance of time, precludes the poſſibility of obtaining ſuch an account of circumſtances, as may be depended on.</p>
                  <p>One reaſon, of my adding this appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix, is, I ſuppoſe that it will not be diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to any who were deſirous that the Narrative ſhould be reprinted, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:039104_0157_1013C3F5019CFAA8"/>
the deſcendants of thoſe who were either killed, wounded, or captivated; and for this reaſon, I have been careful alſo to mention the names of ſuch.</p>
                  <p>Another reaſon is,—I think that every veſtige of hiſtory, which reſpects the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſettlement of a country, ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, for the ſatisfaction of future gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erations.</p>
                  <p>THE laſt account of miſchief, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the former Appendix, done by the enemy in this part of the country, was in Auguſt, 1725. This year, terminated the war. A treaty of peace was held at <hi>Boſton,</hi> by commiſſioners from the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Court, and the Chiefs of the Indian tribes; at which, articles were ſigned, and a long peace enſued.</p>
                  <p>There appeared, for many years, an unuſually pacific ſpirit among the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians; probably in conſequence of ſome acts of the General Court, favourable to them in their trade. It was thought, that they never again would have been diſpoſed to hoſtilities, had they not been under the immediate influence of the French intereſt.</p>
                  <p>War was declared between <hi>France</hi> and
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:039104_0158_1013C43DE999F2B8"/>
                     <hi>England, March,</hi> 1744. The firſt year of the war, no Indians made their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in this part of the country: They had found by experience, that to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an open trade with the Engliſh, was greatly for their intereſt; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at firſt, entered into the war with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance.</p>
                  <p>The firſt miſchief that I can obtain an account of, done by the enemy, in this part of the country, in the courſe of this war, was in <hi>July,</hi> 1745; when a few In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians came to a place called the <hi>Great Meadow,</hi> about 16 miles above fort <hi>Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> on Connecticut River; two of whom, captivated William Phips, as he was hoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his corn. After having taken, and led him about half a mile, they made a ſtand; and as the Indians afterwards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, one of them having laid down his gun, and gone a few rods, for the purpoſe of fetching ſomething he had left, on his return, Phips took up the Indian's gun, fired upon, and killed him; then fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the other with his hoe, ſtruck him down, and bruiſed him, 'till he ſuppoſed he was dead; he then attempted to make his eſcape, but unfortunately, three more
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:039104_0159_1013C3FC1363D630"/>
of the enemy came upon him, and killed him.</p>
                  <p>The ſame month, deacon Joſiah Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, was killed, and ſcalped at a place call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the upper <hi>Aſhwelot.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oct.</hi> 11<hi>th.</hi> The fort at the <hi>Great Meadow,</hi> was attacked by a large party of French and Indians; the attack was bold, and furious, but without ſucceſs. No lives were loſt. Nehemiah How was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken captive, and carried to <hi>Quebeck,</hi> where he ſoon died. The enemy on their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, met one David Rugg, with another perſon, paſſing down Connecticut river in a canoe; Rugg they killed, and ſcalped, the other perſon, with ſome difficulty, made his eſcape.</p>
                  <p>I can find no farther account of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief done by the enemy, in this part of the country, in the year 1745, but in 46 they began in ſeaſon, and the ſufferings of the people were very conſiderable.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>April,</hi> the enemy made their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance at No. 4, (now <hi>Charleſton,</hi>) which was then the moſt northern ſettlement, on Connecticut river; Capt. John Spafford, Iſaac Parker, and Stephen Farnſworth, being at a little diſtance from the fort, were captivated and carried to <hi>Canada.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="163" facs="unknown:039104_0160_1013C441BB999950"/>
The ſame month, a party of Indians ambuſhed the road, between <hi>Northfield</hi> and <hi>Lunenburgh,</hi> and killed Joſhua Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</p>
                  <p>On the 23d of the ſame month, a large party of the enemy, came to the upper <hi>Aſhwelot,</hi> with a deſign to have taken the fort by ſurpriſe, but being diſcovered by a perſon who was providentially, at that time, at a little diſtance from the garriſon, they were diſconcerted; an action howev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er enſued, which continued for ſome time; the enemy finally withdrew. In this action, John Bullard was killed, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than Blake was captivated, and the wife of Daniel M'Kinne, being out of the fort, was overtaken and ſtabbed. Before the enemy retired, they burnt ſeveral build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which was ſuppoſed to have been done, not ſo much for the ſake of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, as to conceal their dead; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many human bones afterwards found among the aſhes.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> the enemy again appeared at No. 4; a few people were near a barn, about ſixty rods from the fort, when they were fired upon by a conſiderable body of the natives who had concealed themſelves in the barn, Seth Put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam,
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:039104_0161_1013C3FD99F47478"/>
a ſoldier belonging to the fort, was kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; whilſt the enemy were endeavouring to ſcalp him, Major Willard, commander of the garriſon, with two ſoldiers, ran near to them undiſcovered, and fired upon them, upon which they retreated in great haſte. The Indians afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to the priſoners in <hi>Canada,</hi> that at this time, two of their number were mortally wounded, and died ſoon after.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>May</hi> 6th, a large party of Indians made an attempt upon the fort at <hi>Falltown;</hi> (now <hi>Bernardſton,</hi>) a perſon about forty rods from the fort diſcovering them, gave information to another farther diſtant than himſelf; by this, the enemy found they were diſcovered, and ran immediately to the fort; an attack commenced, which continued for ſome time, and tho' there were but three ſoldiers in the fort, they defended it till the enemy withdrew. John Burk was ſlightly wounded, one houſe was burnt, and about ten cattle were kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Two Indians were mortally wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who died ſoon after their return.</p>
                  <p>On the ſame day, Serg. John Hawks, and John Miles, were fired upon by two Indians, as they were riding out from fort Maſſachuſetts, and were both wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:039104_0162_1013C444EA485358"/>
Miles made his eſcape to the fort; Hawks fought for ſome time, and as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards appeared, might have taken them both priſoners, had he underſtood their language; they aſked him for quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before he turned to make his eſcape.</p>

                  <p>A few days after, about twenty men were out, fifty or ſixty rods from the fort, at No. 4, viewing the place where Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker was killed on the 2d of the month, and before they diſcovered an enemy, they were fired upon by a large body of Indians, who immediately endeavoured to cut off their communication with the fort; Capt. Stevens, commander of the garriſon, came out with a body of men for their relief, a ſevere action enſued, which continued for ſome time; at

In this ſkirmiſh William Robins and James Parker were killed; John Beaumont and Daniel How were taken captive; Michael Gilſon, and Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick Ray were wounded, but recovered.</p>

                     <hi>Auguſt</hi> 3<hi>d.</hi> A body of the enemy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared at No. 4; ſuſpicions of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach were excited by the yelling of dogs. A ſcout was ſent out from the fort, and had proceeded but a few rods before they were fired on. Ebenezer Philips was killed; the remainder made their eſcape to the fort; the enemy ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded the garriſon, and endeavoured,
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:039104_0165_1013C400A35FB5B8"/>
for three days, to take it; but finding their efforts ineffectual, they withdrew, after having burnt ſeveral buildings, and killed all the cattle, horſes, &amp;c. they could find.</p>
                  <p n="11">11<hi>th.</hi> Benjamin Wright, of <hi>Northfield,</hi> riding in the woods, was fired on, and mortally wounded; he died in a few hours.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="20">20<hi>th.</hi> An army of about nine hundred French and Indians, under the command of Gen. de Vaudreuil, made an attack upon fort Maſſachuſetts. The fort was commanded by Col. Hawks, who, was not in a ſituation to defend it againſt ſuch a force, having but thirty three perſons, both of men, women, and children, in the fort; and being miſerably provided with ammunition; with great fortitude, however, he defended it for twenty eight hours; and had not his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition failed, it is probable he never would have given up the fort. He was,
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:039104_0166_1013C4494F1C4558"/>
finally, neceſſitated to capitulate; and he offered ſuch articles as were accepted by de Vaudreuil. One <hi>ſpecial</hi> article in this capitulation, was, that none of the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhould be delivered into the hands of the Indians; the next day, however, Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreuil divided the priſoners, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them one half, in open violation, and contempt of the article.<note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. de Vaudreuil's plea for this breach of ſaith, was, the danger of mutiny in his army, the Indians being irritated to a great degree, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their being cut off, by the capitulation, from all the profits of the conqueſt. But, how far this plea was a juſtification of ſuch perfidy, I leave to the judicious to determine.</note> The Indians immediately killed one, who, by reaſon of ſickneſs, was unable to travel. The priſoners were, in general, treated with civility, moſt of whom were afterwards redeemed. Col. Hawks loſt but one man in the ſiege. Gen. de Vaudreuil, according to the beſt accounts the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers could obtain, loſt forty five, who were either killed outright, or died of their wounds.</p>
                  <p>Immediately after the capture of the fort, a party of about fifty Indians came
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:039104_0167_1013C408A23BA048"/>
on, for the purpoſe of making depreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon <hi>Deerfield.</hi> They came firſt upon a hill, at the ſouth weſt corner of the ſouth meadow, where they diſcovered ten, or twelve, men and children at work, in a ſituation, in which they might all, with eaſe, be made priſoners. Had they ſucceeded in their deſign, which was, to obtain priſoners, rather than ſcalps, it is probable that events would not have been ſo diſaſtrous as they proved. They were diſconcerted by the following circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: Mr. Eleazer Hawks was out that morning a fowling, and was provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentially at the foot of the hill, at the time the enemy came down; they, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, ſuppoſed they were diſcovered, and immediately fired upon him, killed, and ſcalped him. This gave an alarm to the people in the meadow, ſome of whom were diſtant but a few rods. The ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my were now ſenſible, that what they did muſt be done with diſpatch. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they ruſhed into the meadow, fired on Simeon Amſden, a lad, and killed him, beheaded, and ſcalped him. Mr. Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel Allen, John Sadler, and Adonijah Gillet, ran a few rods, and made a ſtand, under a bank of the river, where they
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:039104_0168_1013C44D6232DA30"/>
were attacked with fury, and fought for a little time with great bravery; they were, however, ſoon overpowered with num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. Allen and Gillet fell. Sadler, finding himſelf alone, ran acroſs the river, and made his eſcape, amidſt a ſhower of balls. Whilſt this was paſſing, Oliver Amſden was purſued a few rods, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, and ſtabbed, after having his hands and fingers cut in pieces by endeavouring to defend himſelf againſt the enemies knives. At the ſame time, three chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by the name of Allen, all of whom are ſtill living, were purſued; Eunice, one of the three, was ſtruck down with a tomahawk, which was ſunk into her head, but by reaſon of the haſte in which the enemy retreated, ſhe was left unſcalped, and afterwards recovered. Caleb, the preſent Mr. Caleb Allen, of <hi>Deerfield,</hi> made his eſcape; and Samuel was taken captive, the only priſoner who was taken at this time.<note n="*" place="bottom">This lad, after a year and nine months, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed. Col. Hawks, who was ſent to <hi>Canada</hi> for the purpoſe of redeeming captives, after enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the lad, was informed, that he was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be ſeen, and that he expreſſed great diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction upon hearing of his arrival: When he was brought into the preſence of Col. Hawks, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended not to know him, altho' he was his uncle, and had always been acquainted with him in <hi>Deer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field;</hi> neither would he ſpeak in the Engliſh tongue, not that he had forgotten it, but to expreſs his unwillingneſs to return; he made uſe of vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous arts, that he might not be exchanged; and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally could not be obtained, but by threats, and was brought off by force. In this we ſee the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing power of habit; this youth had loſt his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for his country, and his friends, in the courſe of one year, and nine months; and had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo attached to the Indians, and their mode of living, as that to this day, he conſiders that of the Indians, the happieſt life. This appears more ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing when we conſider, that he fared extremely hard, and was reduced almoſt to a ſkeleton.</note> The firing immediately alarmed the town. Capt. Hopkins, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:039104_0169_1013C40A28D85068"/>
of the ſtanding guard, together with moſt of the inhabitants, as volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers, came on with the utmoſt expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the enemy had withdrawn in great haſte, expecting, no doubt, a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent attack; they were purſued ſeveral miles by a body of men, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Capt. Cleſſon, but could not be overtaken.</p>
                  <p>It does not appear, as matter of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, that more than one of the enemy was killed at this time, and him, by Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel Allen; ſometime after, however, the remains of a perſon were found, near the
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:039104_0170_1013C4502A0BE2B0"/>
place of action, ſuppoſed to be thoſe of an Indian.</p>
                  <p>This was the laſt miſchief, done by the enemy, in the weſtern frontiers, this ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>April</hi> 7<hi>th,</hi> 1747. A large body of French, and Indians, appeared at No. 4, and laid ſiege to the garriſon, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for three days, when the enemy withdrew, having done but little damage; only ſlightly wounding Joſeph Ely, and John Brown.</p>
                  <p n="15">15<hi>th.</hi> Nathaniel Dickinſon, and Aſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hel Burt, of <hi>Northfield,</hi> being out a little diſtance from the town, were killed, and ſcalped. The enemy, on their return from <hi>Northfield,</hi> burnt moſt of the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and in the upper, and lower <hi>Aſhwelots,</hi> which plantations, a few days before, had been deſerted by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, not having ſufficient protection afforded them by government.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>May</hi> 25<hi>th.</hi> As fort Maſſachuſetts was rebuilding, there being ſeveral hundred people preſent, an army of the enemy came, with a deſign to hinder the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking. About an hundred men, a few days before, had been ſent to <hi>Albany,</hi> for
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:039104_0171_1013C40C23B2BF88"/>
ſtores of proviſions, and ammunition; being on their return, and near the fort, a ſcout was ſent forward, who, coming within ſight of the fort, diſcovered the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy, and began an attack; this gave an alarm to the people at the fort, who, as yet, had not diſcovered the enemy; a few iſſued out, and fought, till the enemy withdrew. There was, at the time, much complaint, both of the people at the fort, and of the commander of that party who was with the waggons, for not affording aſſiſtance, which was imputed to coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice. In this action, three perſons were wounded; and a friend Indian, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to <hi>Stockbridge,</hi> was killed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>July</hi> 15<hi>th.</hi> Eliakim Sheldon, of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardſton,</hi> was fired upon, and wounded; he died the following night.</p>
                  <p>The ſame month, John Mills, of <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi> paſſing from what was called the ſouth fort, to his own houſe, was fired upon and killed.</p>

He had but a few days before returned from captivity, being one who was taken at Maſſachuſetts fort, with his wife, and children.</p>
                  <p>About this time, Jonathan Sawtel was taken captive, from <hi>Hinſdale.</hi>

                     <hi>March</hi> 15<hi>th,</hi> 1748. About eight men were out a few rods from the fort, at No. 4, and were attacked by about twenty In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, who endeavoured to cut off their retreat to the fort; a ſkirmiſh enſued, in which Charles Stevens was killed; a man by the name of Androus was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Eleazer Prieſt was taken captive.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>About the ſame time, Capt. Melvin, with eighteen men, being at the Lake, near <hi>Crownpoint,</hi> fired at two canoes of Indians: On his return, being on Weſt river, about 35 miles from fort Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, was ambuſhed, and being fired on by ſurpriſe, his men were ſcattered: Two or three returned the fire, and killed two of the enemy: The ſame perſons, after having gone ſome diſtance, and having fallen in company with three or four of their own men, concluded to return back, and give the enemy a ſhot; on their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn they were fired on, and one was kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; they returned the fire, and killed one of the enemy. The whole company, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting ſix, made their eſcape through the wood, and came in at different times. In this ſkirmiſh Joſeph Petty, John Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, John Dod, Daniel Mann, and Iſaac Taylor, were killed; Samuel Sev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erance could not be found, and was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be taken captive. The loſs of theſe men, was much lamented; and they are ſpoken of with reſpect, as prudent, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous men, and reſolute ſoldiers.</p>

                     <hi>June</hi> 16<hi>th.</hi> As thirteen men were marching from Col. Hinſdale's, to fort Dummer, they were ambuſhed by a large body of the enemy, and were fired upon.

Bickford was either kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the enemy, the firſt night, or had been wounded, and died of his wounds.</p>
                  <p n="26">26<hi>th.</hi> Capt. Hobbs, paſſing through the woods from No. 4, to fort Shirly, with forty men, and being about twelve miles Northweſt of fort Dummer, was attacked by a large body of the enemy, who had purſued him; it being in the middle of the day, he had made a ſtand, that his men might receive ſome refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; whilſt they were dining, the ſcout, which was ſent upon the back track, were fired on. Upon this, Capt. Hobbs put his men into as much readineſs for an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as two or three minutes would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of. The enemy came on with great fury, expecting, no doubt, an immediate ſurrendry; but Capt. Hobbs gave them
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:039104_0175_1013C415DFC5BE48"/>
a warm reception, and fought, for four hours, with ſuch boldneſs and fortitude, as that had he, and his men, been Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, they would have received a <hi>laurel,</hi> and their <hi>names</hi> would have been handed down with honor, to poſterity; the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my finally fled in haſte, and with great loſs. Capt. Hobbs, in this action, loſt but three men, and had but three wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; thoſe killed were Ebenezer Mitchel, Eli Scott, and Samuel Gunn.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>July</hi> 14<hi>th.</hi> As a ſcout of ſeventeen men were paſſing from Col. Hinſdale's to fort Dummer, they were ambuſhed, and fired upon, by about 120 of the enemy; two only were killed the firſt ſhot; two more were wounded, and but four made their eſcape; the remainder were taken cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; the wounded the enemy killed, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having carried them about a mile.</p>
                  <p n="23">23<hi>d.</hi> The enemy waylaid the main ſtreet, at <hi>Northfield,</hi> and killed Aaron Belding.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Auguſt</hi> 2<hi>d.</hi> About 200 of the enemy, made their appearance at fort Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts; the fort was then under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Capt.

men; who fought for ſome time; but, finding the enemy numerous, he finally retreated to the fort: The enemy ſoon withdrew, and with what loſs was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known. In this action, one Abbot was killed, Lieut. Hawley, and Ezekiel Wells were wounded, but recovered.</p>
                  <p>This is the laſt account I can find, of miſchief done by the enemy in the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern frontiers, in what is called the firſt French war. Peace, however, was not finally ſettled with the Indians, until <hi>Oct.</hi> 1749, when a treaty was held at <hi>Falmouth,</hi> by Commiſſioners from the General Court, and the Chiefs of the Indian tribes, by whom a former treaty, with ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, was renewed.</p>
                  <p>Peace, between <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> took place in the year 1748, and war was again declared in 1756; but, in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of 55, a body of Indians appeared at <hi>Stockbridge,</hi> killed ſeveral perſons, and did conſiderable miſchief, in killing cattle, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>June,</hi> the ſame ſummer, a number of perſons being at work in the meadow, at the upper part of <hi>Charlemont,</hi> were fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on by a party of the enemy; not ſo much miſchief was done, as might have been expected; a number made their eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape:
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:039104_0177_1013C4A68E00B780"/>
Capt. Rice, and Phinehas Arms, were killed, their bodies were afterwards found in a mangled condition. Titus King, and a lad, were taken captive.</p>
                  <p>The ſame month, Capt. Bridgman's Fort, at <hi>Hinſdale,</hi> was taken by a ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem, and a number of perſons were cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated. It was ſuppoſed that the enemy had been lurking about for ſome time, and the ſituation of the ſort was ſuch as that whatever paſſed, either in, or near it, might be eaſily ſeen from the hills a little back: It was the cuſtom of the fort, for the women within to faſten the gate when the men went into the fields to labour, and to open it upon their return, at the ſignal of knocking: The Indians obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, took an opportunity when the men were at the greateſt diſtance from the fort, came, and knocked at the gate; and the women, being under no ſpecial ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of an enemy, immediately threw open the gate, when, to their aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, they found the enemy entering; no reſiſtance was made in the fort, and fourteen perſons were taken captive. The enemy made no longer tarry at the fort, than to ſecure the priſoners, but ruſhed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the meadow, and fell upon the men,
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:039104_0178_1013C4876EAA4230"/>
who, as yet, had not diſcovered what had paſſed at the fort; they made as much reſiſtance as their ſituation would admit of. In this ſkirmiſh, Caleb Howe was killed, the remainder made their eſcape.</p>
                  <p>About this time, the fort at <hi>Keene,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the command of Capt. Sims, was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked by a large party of Indians, and with great fury; the attack was ſuſtained with fortitude. The enemy finding their attempts to take the fort ineffectual, gave over the attack, but wreaked their ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on the inhabitants, by deſtroying all the property they could find, in kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cattle, burning buildings, &amp;c. In this ſiege, no lives were loſt, and but one perſon was taken captive, he being out of the ſort at the time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>July</hi> 3<hi>d.</hi> The enemy appeared at <hi>Keene,</hi> and captivated a perſon by the name of Frizzle.</p>
                  <p>The ſame month, fort Hinſdale was attacked by a conſiderable body of the enemy. In this attack two perſons were killed, and one was taken captive; one of the perſons killed was John Alexander.</p>
                  <p>About the ſame time, two men were killed, at Bellows's ſort. Alſo, a man,
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:039104_0179_1013C4A837169D88"/>
by the name of Pike, was killed at ſome place up the river, but where I cannot tell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>June</hi> 7<hi>th,</hi> 1756. Joſiah Foſter, with his family, were taken captive, at <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter.</hi> The ſame day, a body of the enemy appeared at fort Maſſachuſetts. Benjamin King, and a man by the name of Meacham, were killed.</p>
                  <p>The ſame month, Lieut. Joſeph Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lard, was killed at No. 4.</p>
                  <p>On the 25<hi>th,</hi> as a number of men were coming from the army at the Lake, they were attacked by a large body of the enemy, eight men killed, and five taken captive.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>July</hi> 11<hi>th.</hi> The enemy came to <hi>Weſt Hooſick,</hi> and killed Capt. Chapin, and two perſons by the name of Chideſter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Auguſt</hi> 12<hi>th,</hi> 1756. A party of five, or ſix Indians, made their appearance in <hi>Deerfield,</hi> (now <hi>Greenfield,</hi>) at a place call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Country Farms:</hi> ſeveral men, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Benjamin Haſtings, John Graves, Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iel Graves, Nathaniel Brooks, and Shu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal Atherton, being at work, were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed, by diſcovering the enemy between them and their guns, and being in no ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation to make reſiſtance, found no way
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:039104_0180_1013BE9E1D6A8C50"/>
to ſave themſelves, but by flight. They had fled but a few rods, before they were fired on; none were either killed, or wounded the firſt ſhot; the enemy ſtill purſued, and continued their firing. Shu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal Atherton was ſoon killed; Benjamin Haſtings, and John Graves, made their eſcape; Daniel Graves, and Nathaniel Brooks, were taken captive. Graves was killed, after the enemy had conveyed him but a little diſtance; he was in years, and it was ſuppoſed, he was unable to travel with ſuch ſpeed as the enemy wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Brooks never returned from his captivity.</p>
                  <p>1757. The enemy appeared at No. 4, and captivated five perſons; the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of this matter I cannot aſcertain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>March</hi> 20<hi>th,</hi> 1758. John Morriſon, and John Henry, of <hi>Colrain,</hi> being near what is called <hi>North River,</hi> (a branch of <hi>Deerfield River,</hi>) were fired on, and were both wounded; Capt. Morriſon's barn was burnt, and his cattle were killed the ſame day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>March</hi> 21<hi>ſt,</hi> 1759. The enemy again appeared at <hi>Colrain,</hi> and captivated Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph M'Cown, with his wife. Mrs. M'Cown, was killed by the enemy, after
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:039104_0181_1013C4AF8D27C470"/>
one day's travel, ſhe being unable to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
                  <p>This is the laſt account, which I can obtain, of miſchief done by the enemy, in the weſtern frontiers, in the laſt French war.</p>
                  <p>APPREHENDING that it will not be diſagreeable to the public, I here <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join</hi> a circumſtantial account, of what is called the <hi>Fall Fight,</hi> which happened in May, 1676.</p>
                  <p>The following, I have taken in part, from Hubbard's hiſtory of the Indian wars; but principally, from an atteſted copy of a manuſcript, written by ſome gentlemen who were in the action.</p>
                  <p>SEVERAL large bodies of Indians had aſſembled at different places about <hi>Deer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field.</hi> Two tribes had ſeated themſelves at the falls, one on the Eaſt, and the oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er on the Weſt ſide of the river. A lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle below the falls, upon an iſland, was another tribe. Another had placed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on the Weſt ſide of the river, at a little diſtance above the falls: And a fifth had taken their reſidence at <hi>Cheapſide.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Indians, being previouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, by ſome of their captives, that
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:039104_0182_1013C45B828A73A0"/>
the forces were principally withdrawn from the neighbouring towns, had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudently fallen into a ſtate of ſecurity. The inhabitants being informed of this, by ſome priſoners, who had been ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate as to make their eſcape, determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to improve the opportunity, and if poſſible, extirpate them from this part of the country. All the ſoldiers, who could be raiſed, for this almoſt deſperate expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, both from the militia, and the ſtanding forces, amounted to only one hundred and ſixty. The ſtanding forces were commanded by Capt. Turner, of <hi>Boſton.</hi> The volunteers by their own offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. Thoſe from <hi>Spring field,</hi> by Capt. Holyoke; from <hi>Northampton,</hi> by enſign Lyman; from <hi>Hadley,</hi> and <hi>Hatfield,</hi> by ſergeants Kellogg, and Dickinſon. The Rev. Hope Atherton, miniſter of the Goſpel, at <hi>Hatfield,</hi> a gentleman of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſpirit, accompanied the army. The pilots were Meſſrs. Benjamin Wait, and Experience Hinſdale.</p>
                  <p>Theſe troops marched from <hi>Hatfield, May</hi> 17<hi>th,</hi> 1676, a little before night. Paſſing <hi>Deerfield River,</hi> at <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> they were heard by the Indian ſentinel, who
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:039104_0183_1013C4B11F874230"/>
immediately alarmed the tribe, inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, that horſes had paſſed the riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Search was made, at the uſual ford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place, which our troops had happily miſſed, having by miſtake, croſſed a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle above, and the enemy finding no tracks, concluded, that their ſentry had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and that what he heard, muſt have been the noiſe of Mooſe, paſſing the river near the fording place. Meeting with no oppoſition from this tribe, our troops marched on, till they came to the falls. It was now about the break of day. According to their wiſhes, our army found the enemy in an unguarded ſituation, without even a ſentinel. The reaſon why, at this time, they were thus ſurpriſingly unguarded, was, the evening before they had been rioting upon milk, and roaſt beef, having been pillaging cows from the neighbouring towns. When the day opened, ſo that our army could diſtinguiſh <hi>friends</hi> from <hi>foes,</hi> they march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up and began the attack, by firing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>wigwams.</hi> The Indians awaking in ſurpriſe, and in their conſternation ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that they were attacked by their native enemies, cried, <hi>Mohawks! Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawks!</hi> They ſoon, however, diſcovered
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:039104_0184_1013C45E62CF3D58"/>
their miſtake; but being in no ſituation to make an immediate defence, great numbers were ſlain upon the ſpot,—ſome, in their ſurpriſe, ran directly into the riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and were drowned; others betook themſelves to their bark canoes, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their confuſion forgot their pad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, were hurried down the falls, and daſhed againſt the rocks; and many who had endeavoured to ſecrete themſelves under the river bank, were diſcovered, and ſlain.</p>
                  <p>In this action the enemy, by their own confeſſion, loſt 300, women, and children included.</p>
                  <p>This victory, tho' great, and obtained with the loſs of only one man, in the firſt onſet, was however, diſaſtrous in the iſſue. The few who had not been ſlain, of this tribe, after recovering from their fright, and being joined by the neighbouring tribes, diſcovering the ſmallneſs of the number, by whom they had been thus furiouſly attacked, and by whom they had ſuſtained ſuch a loſs, purſued, and harraſſed the army on their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, with ſuch fury, that thirty ſeven were killed, and ſeveral were wounded.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="188" facs="unknown:039104_0185_1013C4B2AC56BD10"/>
This loſs was imputed, in part, to the bodily infirmities of Capt. Turner; and in part to the want of ammunition, which was the cauſe of an illtimed and unguard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed retreat.</p>
                  <p>A few, to the number of about twenty, did not quit the ground, with the main body of the army, but tarried behind, for the purpoſe of firing at ſome of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my who were croſſing the river. Theſe men ſoon found themſelves under the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of diſputing the ground, with a conſiderable body of the enemy, before they could recover their horſes; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſevere ſkirmiſh, obtained their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and ſoon came up with the army, which was ſurrounded, and fought on their retreat for ten miles. Seven, or eight men, in the beginning of the retreat, were, by ſome accident, unfortunately ſeparated from the army, and being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with the ground, knew not what courſe to purſue. The Indians, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, gave the following account of them: That on Monday after the fight, eight Engliſhmen came to them, who were loſt, and offered to ſurrender, on condition their lives might be ſpared; but, inſtead of giving them quarter, they
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:039104_0186_1013C461EBFA31A8"/>
took and burnt them in the following manner: They firſt covered them with dry thatch, then ſet fire to it, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled them to run: When one covering was burnt off, they put on another, and ſo continued, till death delivered them from their hands.</p>
                  <p>This expedition was productive of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry happy conſequences, for the enemy were ſo diſconcerted in all their plans, and ſo greatly diſheartened, that they never after, during that war, gave any conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſturbance to the frontiers. From this expedition may be dated their decline in theſe parts.</p>
                  <p>In the above action was one Jonathan Wells, of <hi>Hatfield,</hi> then a youth, in his 17th year, he was afterwards a gentleman improved in public life, and ſuſtained a worthy character. The following is the ſubſtance of an atteſted copy of an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, taken from his own mouth.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Wells was one of the 20 men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bovementioned, who were under a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of diſputing the ground, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of recovering their horſes. Soon after he had mounted, being in the rear, three of the enemy fired upon him; one of their balls bruſhed his hair, another
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:039104_0187_1013C4B89D965358"/>
wounded his horſe, and a third ſtruck his thigh, in a place where it had before been broken with a cart wheel; the ball did not wholly break his thigh anew, but fractured the end of one of the bones, which was a little projected over the oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, it having been badly ſet. Upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the wound, it was with difficulty that Mr. Wells kept in his ſaddle. The Indians perceiving they had wounded him, preſſed hard upon him. Mr. Wells recovering a little from the firſt ſhock, and perceiving the enemy almoſt upon him, preſented his gun, which gave them a check, and whilſt they were charging, he made his eſcape, and reached the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. He repreſented to Capt. Turner, the danger to which the people in the rear were expoſed, and urged him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their relief, or halt till they might come up; but he anſwered, "It is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to loſe ſome, than all." The army was now divided into ſeveral companies, one pilot crying, "If you will ſave your lives, follow me;" and another, "If you regard your ſafety, follow me." Mr. Wells was now following a company, whoſe courſe was towards a ſwamp; but perceiving that a body of the enemy were
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:039104_0188_1013C464E77C46C0"/>
there, he left that company, who were all loſt, and joined a ſmall party, who were taking a different route; but his horſe ſoon failing by reaſon of his wound, and himſelf being much weakened by loſs of blood, he was left by this party, having only one Jones, a wounded, man to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him: They had no path to guide them, and were both unacquainted with the woods. They had not travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led far, before Mr. Wells was ſeparated from Jones, and finding himſelf faint, ate a nutmeg which he had in his pocket, upon which he revived. After having wandered in the woods for ſome time, he came upon <hi>Green River,</hi> and he followed the courſe of it up, till he came to a place called the <hi>Country Farms;</hi> having paſſed the river he attempted to aſcend a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain on the Weſt ſide, but fainted, and fell from his horſe. How long he lay in this condition he knew not, but when he recovered, he found his horſe ſtanding by him, and his bridle hanging on his hand. He aroſe, tied his horſe, and again laid himſelf down; but upon reflection, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf already ſo weak as to be una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to mount, concluded that he ſhould have no farther uſe for his horſe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:039104_0189_1013C4BA22341698"/>
unwilling he ſhould die at the tree, diſmiſſed him; but unhappily forgot to take any proviſion from his portmanteau, altho' it contained a plenty. Towards night, being troubled with muſquetoes, he ſtruck up a fire; but this almoſt proved his deſtruction; it aroſe, and ſpread with ſuch fury, among the leaves and traſh, that it was with difficulty, in his faint con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, he eſcaped periſhing in the flames. After he was out of danger, from the fire, he again laid himſelf down to reſt; but now new fears aroſe; he imagined that the fire would direct the enemy where to find him, and ſerve to betray him into their hands:—Unwilling the enemy ſhould be benefited by his ammunition, he caſt it to as great a diſtance as he could, reſerving only a round or two for their uſe, ſhould he fall into their hands. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome time, finding his fire had ſpread conſiderably, he took courage, put ſome tow into his wounds, bound them up with his handkerchief, and compoſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſleep. In his ſleep he dreamed, that his grandfather came to him, and told him he was loſt, and muſt turn, and go down that river, till he ſhould come to the end of a mountain, where he would
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:039104_0190_1013C467D47390B0"/>
find a plain, upon which he muſt travel, in order to find his way home. When he awoke he found himſelf refreſhed,—his bleeding ſtopped, and his ſtrength re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruited, and with the help of his gun as a ſtaff, he was able to walk, tho' but ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The riſing of the ſun, convinced him, he was loſt, and that the courſe he intended to purſue was wrong. He had now wandered ſeveral miles farther from home, than when he ſet out from the place of action. And tho,' at firſt, he paid no attention to his dream, now he determined to follow the directions of it. Accordingly, he travelled down the river, found the end of the mountain, and ſoon came to the plain; all of which, agreed to the repreſentation in his dream.<note n="*" place="bottom">I doubt, whether, in this dream, there was any thing ſupernatural, as ſome may be ready to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Mr. Wells, having wandered in the woods ſix or ſeven miles, muſt neceſſarily have had ſome doubts whether his courſe was right; and his mind, when aſleep, would more naturally employ itſelf on this ſubject, than any other; becauſe, to find the way home, muſt have been his great object, when awake. His dreaming, that his grandfather ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him, was nothing ſtrange;—and his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſituation at this time was ſuch, that he could not be entirely unacquainted with the natural make of the ground; and his thoughts running as they did, in this dream, would be natural; the river was near him—the plain was before him—and the end of the mountain, near the ſide of the plain, if he had not previouſly ſeen it, would naturally be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</note> Soon after he entered upon the plain, he found
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:039104_0191_1013C4BC0EB8E3F0"/>
a foot path, which led him to the road, in which, the main body of the army return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. When he came to <hi>Deerfield River,</hi> he met with much difficulty in croſſing; the ſtream carrying his lame leg acroſs the other, ſo that ſeveral of his firſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts were without effect.—Finally, however, with the help of his gun, with much difficulty he reached the oppoſite ſhore. When he had aſcended the bank, being greatly fatigued, he laid himſelf down under a walnut buſh, and fell aſleep. When he awoke, the firſt object that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, was an Indian in a canoe, coming directly towards him. Mr. Wells now found himſelf in a very unhappy condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being ſo diſabled by his wounds that he could not make his eſcape, and his gun being ſo filled with gravel and ſand, in croſſing the river, that he could not fight. As ſoon however, as he perceived the Indian had diſcovered him, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:039104_0192_1013C469596D3B48"/>
his gun, which ſo affrighted him, that he leaped out of the canoe, leaving his own gun, and made his eſcape. Mr. Wells concluding that he would inform the whole tribe, who were only a few rods diſtant, went into a neighbouring ſwamp, and finding two logs lying near each oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and covered over with rubbiſh, he crept between them. He ſoon heard the noiſe of Indians; but was not curious to look out after them. When the noiſe had ceaſed, he ventured to proceed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. In <hi>Deerfield</hi> meadow he found ſome horſes bones, from which he ſcrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome matter, which ſerved for food;—he alſo found two or three rotten beans, where the Indians had threſhed, and alſo two Bluebird's eggs, which was all the ſuſtenance he had till he reached home. He came to <hi>Deerfield</hi> town plat, on Sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urday night about dark, but as there were no inhabitants preſent, the town having a little before been burnt, he continued his courſe in the evening.</p>
                  <p>He was often under great diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and frequently laid himſelf down to die, expecting to riſe no more. He reached no farther than <hi>Muddy Brook</hi> as the ſun roſe on ſabbath morning. Here,
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:039104_0193_1013C4BF6EF32270"/>
ſeeing a human head, which had been dug up by wild beaſts, Mr. Wells, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the diſtreſſes of his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſtoped to find the grave, which hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found he laid the head to the body, and covered it with billets of wood, to defend it from the ravenous beaſts of the wilderneſs. After he had left the brook and entered upon the plain, he grew faint and very thirſty, but could obtain no wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for a conſiderable time; he was, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, often refreſhed, by holding his face in the ſmoke of burning knots of pine, which he frequently met with, as the woods were on fire. Mr. Wells arrived at <hi>Hatfield</hi> on the Sabbath, between meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and was received with inexpreſſible joy, as one having ariſen from the dead. He endured incredible pain, and diſtreſs, with his wound, being confined ſeveral times to his bed, for ſix months together; and it was upwards of four years before he was ſound.</p>
                  <p>In this action was alſo the Rev. Mr. Atherton, miniſter of the goſpel, in <hi>Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field.</hi> The following is the ſubſtance of a paragraph, which he delivered to his people the Sabbath after his return:</p>

I was ſeparated from the army; the night following, I wandered up and down among the dwelling places of the enemy, but none of them diſcovered me. The next day, I tendered myſelf to them a priſoner, for no way of eſcape appeared, and I had been a long time without food; but notwithſtanding I offered myſelf to them, yet, they accepted not the offer; when I ſpake they anſwered not; and when I moved toward them they fled.<note n="*" place="bottom">There were various conjectures at the time, relative to this ſtrange conduct of the Indians; the moſt probable one was, that it aroſe from ſome of their religious ſuperſtitions.

                  <head>Hiſtorical Sketch of Deerfield.</head>
                  <p>THE Indian name of Deerfield was Pecomptuck. Its ſituation was favora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Indian mode of living; abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with proviſions which might be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obtained; and which were peculiarly agreeable to a people in a ſtate of nature. It was the hunting ground for ſeveral tribes. One tribe was ſeated on a hill half a mile N. E. of the meeting houſe. Another, about two miles north of them, upon the north bank of Pecomptuck, or Deerfield river. And two or three tribes lived in the N. E. part of the town, at, or near the falls in Connecticut river.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="199" facs="unknown:039104_0196_1013C4710DA4C858"/>
According to tradition, theſe tribes had frequent wars with each other, otherwiſe they were happy.</p>
                  <p>Theſe natives were exceedingly attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their hunting and fiſhing grounds. When driven from the enjoyment of their privileges and natural rights, they mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted a peculiar enmity to their aggreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors—I ſay <hi>aggreſſors,</hi> for if any, but a ſmall part of the town was ever purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of them.</p>
                  <p>Gladly would I throw a vail of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs over ſome of the tranſactions of our forefathers, but fidelity forbids it.</p>
                  <p>They appear to have been almoſt as blind to the rights of the <hi>natives,</hi> as they were to thoſe of the <hi>Africans.</hi> And it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſuppoſed, that they, who juſtified the enſlaving of one heathen nation, would be backward in wreſting by force lands from another. The idea was too much cheriſhed, that they themſelves were the people of God—the choſen Iſraelites, and that the natives, being heathen, were in the ſituation of the Canaanites, whom the Children of Iſrael had a right, by the command of God, to extirpate. They alſo retained the barbarous idea, that the right of poſſeſſion, was obtained by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:039104_0197_1013C4C8B2E60780"/>
And the poor natives, not having the advantages of defence, ariſing from civilization, were obliged to give way to ſuperior force. In ſome inſtances, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, lands were regularly purchaſed of them.</p>
                  <p>It has been common to extol the firſt ſettlers of America for their piety; and to conſider them as martyrs of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt government of Great Britain; from the tyranny of which they fled to ſave their lives; and to enjoy the rights of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. That they were in general pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous there is no doubt: But, they were guilty of ſome groſs irregularities, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian conduct, altogether unaccountable.</p>
                  <p>Their treatment of the natives was ſuch as frequently involved them in the greateſt diſtreſſes. It was natural for the Aborigines to retaliate the wrongs they received. And, probably, ſome part of the ſufferings of our forefathers, was juſt.</p>
                  <p>When grants of land were made by the Crown or the General Court, in compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation for ſervices performed, the grantees felt that they had a right to the lands and took no pains to extinguiſh Indian titles. And, indeed, in thoſe times, nothing was ſaid about Indian titles; for it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:039104_0198_1013C4742CBC8B90"/>
that they had no title to the lands they poſſeſſed.</p>
                  <p>This was doubtleſs the caſe with the greateſt part of Deerfield.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1669, a grant of 8000 a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres of land, was made by the General Court, under the adminiſtration of Gov. Bellingham to the town of Dedham. This grant covered the lands from the mouth of Pecomptuck river to about two miles ſouth of the mountain, called Sugar Loaf, and extended as far weſt as to include that number of acres.</p>
                  <p>The year following a diſpute aroſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the inhabitants of Hatfield, and the proprietors of Pecomptuck reſpecting their diviſion line. To ſettle this diſpute, a committee of the General Court was appointed. The line was altered in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Hatfield, and the proprietors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an equivalent in lands north of Pecomptuck river—extending three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of a mile north from the mouth of Green river, and about one mile eaſt and weſt.</p>
                  <p>In conſequence of a petition of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors, in the year 1673, they received a promiſe of the General Court, of an act
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:039104_0199_1013C4CA38A40FA0"/>
of incorporation, on certain conditions, and the former grant was now enlarged to a ſquare of 7 miles.</p>
                  <p>From this time the town was called by the name of <hi>Deerfield.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the year 1712, the Rev. Mr. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams entered a petition that the bounds of the town might be further enlarged, and extend as far weſt as to run parallel with the weſt line of Hatfield. The prayer of this petition was granted, and the town was extended 9 miles from the river. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to this the proprietors might have received a grant of the north part of the town, but no record of it is to be found. It is probable that theſe lands were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to thoſe of the proprietors, at the time the act of incorporation paſſed—which was in the year 1682.</p>
                  <p>But four towns in the County had been previouſly incorporated. Theſe were, Springfield, incorporated, 1645. Had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, in 1661. Weſtfield, in 1669, and Hatfield, in 1670.</p>
                  <p>The firſt regular meeting of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors of Pecomptuck was at Dedham, March 1ſt, 1670,—at which, meaſures were taken for laying out the town plat,
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:039104_0200_1013C4775CBCA4C8"/>
and the 8000 acres into regular lots. This important buſineſs was tranſacted, however, anſwerably to the ſimplicity of the times. The town was laid out in ſuch a looſe, and irregular manner as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, immediately, and in after times many diſputes and quarrels.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Deerfield,</hi> or <hi>Pecomptuck,</hi> began to be ſettled in the ſpring of the year 1671. As the natives at this time appeared to be friendly, a few families erected houſes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the main ſtreet, which was then a foreſt.</p>
                  <p>Theſe ſettlers lived in peace with their Indian neighbours until 1675, when thoſe wars, and diſtreſſing ſcenes commenced, which continued, moſt of the time, for 90 years.</p>
                  <p>At this time, the famous war, called King Philip's, broke out. It was general, and extended to all the tribes in this part of America.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems that the Indians began to feel the evil effects of their Engliſh neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; and were determined if poſſible to deſtroy them.</p>
                  <p>In Sept. this year, Deerfield was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked, and one of the inhabitants was killed. The ſame month, when going to
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:039104_0201_1013C4D0F9DD5AC0"/>
the place of public worſhip, on the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath they were again attacked; but none were killed. They perceived, however, the danger to be daily increaſing, but had no apprehenſion of the vaſt body of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians who were then hovering around them.</p>
                  <p>At this time, there was a conſiderable quantity of proviſions in the town, and it was conceived to be neceſſary to remove them to Hatfield; although a guard had been ſent into the town, to protect the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlers, under the command of Capt. Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley. Capt. Lathrop was ſent from Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, with about 80 men, to guard theſe proviſions on the way. At Muddy, ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, Bloody Brook, he was attacked by 7 or 8 hundred of the natives. Capt. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throp, with 73 of his men fell in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy engagement. The company at Deerfield marched with the greateſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition for their relief, but were too late to ſave Capt. Lathrop. They fought, however, the whole body of the Indians for ſeveral hours, and were finally joined by Major Treat, with one hundred and ſixty friend Indians of the Mohegan tribe. This force, after a ſevere and bloody ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, diſperſed the enemy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="205" facs="unknown:039104_0202_1013C47AB06177B0"/>
Diſpirited by this ſtroke many of the Indians left this part of the country, and ſettled in the Naraganſetts; ſome, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, remained, and the ſettlers deſerted their habitations.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame month, in which theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters happened at Deerfield, Hadley was attacked, when the people were at meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This was the time when, according to tradition, Goff the regicide, one of king Charles' Judges, ſuddenly made his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, headed the troops, and diſperſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the enemy.</p>
                  <p>After Deerfield was deſerted, it was plundered and burnt by the natives. In the ſpring of 1676 the fall fight happened, (ſee former appendix.)</p>
                  <p>An attempt was made to reſettle the town in 1677. Very ſoon, however, a number of the people were ſlain. In conſequence of this the town was a ſecond time deſerted, and all ideas of reſettling it, were given up for the preſent.</p>
                  <p>In the ſpring of 1682, the ſettlers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned; and for ſeveral years enjoyed their habitations without moleſtation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="206" facs="unknown:039104_0203_1013C4D4A7DE7B60"/>
In this interval of peace, and but four years after the return of the inhabitants Mr. John Williams was ordained to the paſtoral charge of the Church.</p>
                  <p>It appears from the records, that the promiſe of an act of incorporation, and the firſt grant in addition to the 8000 acres, were made on condition the inhabitants would ſettle a miniſter within the term of three years. This, however, they could not comply with, as they were driven from their habitations; but it was attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, as ſoon as circumſtances would permit.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1687, that part of the town, which is now Greenfield, was laid out, eſpecially, the home lots on Green river.</p>
                  <p>In 1693, the troubles of the inhabitants again commenced, and their ſufferings were great and uninterrupted till 1712. Every year, ſome of them were either Kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or captivated.</p>
                  <p>Hutchinſon, in his hiſtory of Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts obſerves, that in '97, "an attempt was made upon Deerfield by the natives, but failed of ſucceſs, through the vigilance of the inhabitants, with Mr. Williams their miniſter at their head."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="207" facs="unknown:039104_0204_1013C47CA4E0F2D0"/>
After the commencement of Queen Ann's war, the French in Canada, joined with the natives, and encouraged them in all their wars and depredations againſt the Engliſh.</p>
                  <p>The troubles and dangers of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were now greatly increaſed.—And Deerfield was called to endure the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt calamities.</p>
                  <p>A party of about 300 French and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, made their appearance in Feb. 1703, 4, entered the town in the night, and while an unfaithful ſentinel was aſleep, found their way upon the ſnow, over the pickets into the fort, in the centre of the town; and in a few hours ſlew about 40 of the inhabitants; and took about 100 priſoners; compriſing one half of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants; and finally, as the day opened, they left the town on fire. A new meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing houſe, with all the buildings in the town, two or three excepted, were burnt.</p>
                  <p>Several of the people made their eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape from the fort, after the enemy had entered it. Among whom was a Capt. Stoddard, who that night was a lodger with Mr. Williams. He leaped from his chamber window into the ſnow, with his
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:039104_0205_1013C4D830BF9958"/>
cloak only—ran to the weſt—croſſed the river, and having ſecreted himſelf, tore his cloak in pieces, wrapped parts of it about his feet, and in the morning arrived at Hatfield, much frozen.</p>
                  <p>The unhappy priſoners were puſhed forward into the meadow, to begin their dreary journey to Canada, in the cold and ſnow, without proper cloathing, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proviſions.</p>
                  <p>Here was trouble! trouble, of which we can form but a faint idea! To par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularize inſtances of great diſtreſs, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by theſe ſcenes, would be needleſs. It is ſufficient to obſerve in general, that the people were awaked out of ſleep by the war-whoops of the ſavages—the ſhrieks of the diſtreſſed, and the groans of the dying. Parents now ſaw their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent babes daſhed in pieces before their eyes—huſbands, wives, and children were torn from each others arms, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſent into eternity, or to be carried by ſavages into the wilderneſs;—ſuch as were ſick, and unable to walk, were ſlain for the ſake of their ſcalps. All was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and terror! The ſhrieks of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men—the cries of children—the groans of
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:039104_0206_1013C4840D9D7558"/>
the dying—and the war-whoops of the ſavages were confuſedly mingled! The priſoners were ſtowed into the meeting houſe, while the pillage and ſlaughter were going on. But few could know what the ſituations of their neareſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions were,—whether expiring under the ſtrokes of the tomahawk, or among the priſoners.</p>
                  <p>While theſe ſcenes were paſſing in the centre of the town, a ſmall fort, about 50 rods to the ſouth was violently attacked; but the people defended themſelves dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the night, and preſerved it; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, almoſt all the inhabitants would have been killed, or made priſoners.</p>
                  <p>Troops arriving from Hatfield ſoon after the departure of the enemy, a battle was fought in the north meadow. They might have been purſued, and greatly harraſſed. But it was conceived, that this would expoſe the priſoners to imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate death—and for the ſame reaſon, the battle in the meadow, was not fought with much animation.</p>
                  <p>Many of the priſoners were too weak and feeble to endure ſuch hardſhips as
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:039104_0207_1013C4DCE1A0A868"/>
they were now called to ſuffer:—And, when any one failed, and was unable to travel, he was ſlain and ſcalped. This was the caſe with Mr. Williams's Lady, ſoon after ſhe left the town.</p>
                  <p>Theſe priſoners were 25 days on their march in this inclement ſeaſon, to Sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blee. They received, however, ſome aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and many kind offices, even from the ſavages; but their ſufferings were extreme.</p>
                  <p>What an awful ſcene was preſented to the inhabitants who had eſcaped, on the morning after the departure of the enemy.</p>
                  <p>They perceived the town ſmoaking in its ruins!—they found that their miniſter—their neighbours—their huſbands—their wives—and their children were driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en away into the wilderneſs, by ſavages—perhaps, never to be ſeen by them again. They muſt have perceived one lying here, and another there, in the ſtreets, rolled in blood, and mangled with the tomahawk, and ſcalping knives,—and ſome ſtill breathing—groaning—and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing!</p>
                  <p>Their buſineſs now was to gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the Indian ſacrifice, even, an Hec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atomb
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:039104_0208_1013C485938901D0"/>
of mangled corpſes—and to ſear among the blood, and wounds, for ſome diſtinguiſhing marks of their connexions and friends!—But I will paſs from this ſcene of horror.—</p>
                  <p>Moſt of the priſoners, who arrived at Canada, were, at different periods, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed.—In the year 1706, after a ſcene of unparalleled ſufferings the Rev. Mr. Williams, and 57 of the priſoners were redeemed. The return of the priſoners, from ſuch a captivity excited joys, better conceived than expreſſed.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Williams did not return immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately upon his arrival at Boſton. And it appears, that he was in a ſtate of doubt, whether to ſettle again in Deerfield. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 10 days after his arrival, the town choſe a committee to wait upon him at Boſton to urge his return—to take advice of the Elders of the churches upon the matter, and to petition the General Court to make him a grant, in compenſation for his loſſes, and as an encouragement to reſettle.—After much deliberation Mr. Williams, concluded to return, altho' the war ſtill raged, and the inhabitants were in conſtant fear.</p>
                  <p>The following ſummer, ſeveral perſons
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:039104_0209_1013C4DE666767D8"/>
were killed, and no one was ſafe night or day, at a diſtance from the fort. Theſe diſtreſſes continued until the cloſe of Queen Ann's war. Almoſt every year, ſome were either killed, wounded, or taken priſoners, and carried to Canada.</p>
                  <p>From the year 1712, to 1720, the people lived in peace; from '20, to '25, their troubles were conſiderable:—In '25, peace was made with the natives, and no further depredations of conſequence were committed upon the frontiers till the year 1744.</p>
                  <p>In this interval of peace, in June 1729, the Rev. Mr. Williams departed this life, in the 48th year of his miniſtry, and in the 66th of his age.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Williams was a man of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed piety, and of great fortitude. The ſacrifice which he made in ſettling in a frontier town, when he knew he ſhould be conſtantly expoſed to the calamities ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Indian depredations, ſets his character in his youth, in an amiable point of light. But a few years of his life did he enjoy the ſweets of peace.—And his ſhare of ſorrows, was ſuch, as ſeldom falls to the lot of an individual. He had the peculiarly hard fortune to ſee his flour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:039104_0210_1013BE9C9898E7D0"/>
family torn in pieces, and one of his children daſhed upon the ſtones be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eyes—his dear companion drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from a bed of ſickneſs, and driven out by unfeeling ſavages, into the ſnow and ſtorms, to linger a few days, and then in cold blood to be ſlain, and ſcalped. He ſaw his ſurviving children ſcattered among the French and Indians in Canada; and every artifice uſed to bring them over to the Romiſh faith, which would have ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually prevented their return. And he ever after ſaw one of his dear daughters, a companion of a ſavage, and almoſt transformed into one herſelf. Such troubles this good man ſuffered:—but he bore them with reſignation.—And we truſt, thro' much tribulation he has enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into heaven, and is reaping the reward of a faithful ſervant.</p>
                  <p>This year the meeting houſe, in which we now are, was raiſed.</p>
                  <p>In 1732, Mr. Jonathan Aſhley had a call to ſettle in the work of the miniſtry: He accepted the call, and was ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Nov. 8th, the ſame year.</p>
                  <p>From this time until '44, our fathers enjoyed the bleſſings of peace. At this time, the natives again renewed their dep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redations;
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:039104_0211_1013C4E8723F8E50"/>
and the town was at great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence in building forts and mounts for defence. It ſeems that the General Court did not afford to the inhabitants that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, which their expoſed ſituation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; and which they had a right to expect; and that, notwithſtanding for three years ſucceſſively they petitioned for help, ſtating their difficulties, and great expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
                  <p>The year 1745, was moſt diſtreſſing, and rendered memorable, by an attack upon the people in the South meadow; in which a number of perſons were ſlain. One was left for dead, but recovered, and is ſtill living; and another was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into captivity.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1749, danger ceaſed, and a committee was choſen to diſpoſe of the materials of which the forts were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
                  <p>During the preceding war, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes of the people were great. They were frequently harraſſed by the enemy. Were under the neceſſity of lodging in picketed houſes, and of labouring in the field in companies, under the protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a guard; and nights, guards were
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:039104_0212_1013C48AC4E5B538"/>
continually kept, and patroles walked the ſtreets.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1755, the people were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain called to build forts for defence. And in '56, it was voted that four garriſons ſhould be built. But from this time, the armies which were ſent to the northward, were ſo ſucceſsful that danger decreaſed; and in '58 the timbers of theſe forts were ſold, altho' peace between France and England, did not take place until 1763.</p>
                  <p>About the year 1759, Conway and Shelburne began to be ſettled, and ſoon after the out lands in Greenfield, which were, originally, a part of Deerfield.</p>
                  <p>The Rev. Mr. Aſhley departed this life, after a long and diſtreſſing illneſs, in the year 1780, in the 68th year of his age, and in the 48th of his miniſtry. The ſame length of time with his predeceſſor.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Aſhley was poſſeſſed of a ſtrong and diſcerning mind, and a lively imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ination. He was independent in his feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and conduct. He enlarged his mind by reading and ſtudy. And was a pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and energetic preacher. He deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:039104_0213_1013C4E9F87D22C8"/>
the doctrines of grace with a <hi>pathos,</hi> which was the effect, not barely of an hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical belief in their divine authority; but, of a deep ſenſe and lively view of their excellency and power.</p>
                  <p>In Feb. 1787, your preſent paſtor was ordained to the work of the goſpel Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtry.</p>
                  <p>In 1797, the General Court paſſed an Act of incorporation for an Academy in Deerfield. The following year a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient building was erected for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and the Academy was opened on the firſt of Jan. 1799. Since which, four hundred and ſeventy ſix youths have received inſtruction in it.</p>
                  <p>As to the population of Deerfield, I would obſerve, that in April 1703-4, the number of ſouls was about 280. In the year 1763, there were, in the bounds of the original town 1105 ſouls: <abbr>viz.</abbr> in Deerfield 737, and in Greenfield 368. By the laſt cenſus, it appears, that there are now, in Deerfield, 1531.—In Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way 2013.—In Greenfield 1256.—In Shelburne 1089, and in Gill excluſive of thoſe taken off from Northfield 644. The whole number of ſouls therefore, within
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:039104_0214_1013C492207E9E68"/>
the original bounds of Deerfield is 6533.</p>
                  <p>According to this ſtatement, the inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants doubled their numbers, in the firſt period, in about 30 years. And from 1763—to the preſent time, they have doubled in nearly 15 years.</p>
                  <p>This ſtatement ſhows, in a ſtriking manner, the rapid increaſe of population, ſince the cloſe of the laſt French war; and how friendly peace, and the agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural means of ſupport, are to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the human race. It will be ſaid, perhaps, that many perſons have come into the town ſince that period; this is true; but, emigrations alſo have been great—ſome years of 80, or an hundred ſouls.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt period, from 1703—to 1763 there was not a rapid increaſe; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny loſt their lives by the natives; and a ſtate of fear operates in ſome unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able way againſt a rapid population. Hutchinſon obſerves that for fifty years, preceding the year 1713, the number of inhabitants in the ſtate had not doubled.</p>
                  <p>One hundred years have produced a great alteration in the ſtate of religion, and
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:039104_0215_1013C4EBBA997700"/>
ſociety. Civil liberty, a general diffuſion of knowledge, and free diſcuſſion, have removed many ſuperſtitious ideas, and practices;—but the preſent generation have gone too far, and to deſtroy ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, and fanaticiſm, have called in queſtion the great truths of revelation, and opened all the avenues of vice. In avoiding the errors of our fathers we have avoided alſo their virtues.</p>
                  <p>Many things have tranſpired which have had a tendency to corrupt the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of ſociety. A great part of the time in which we were under the government of Great Britain, our governors being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the crown, and being foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, there was a jealouſy ſubſiſting between the different branches of government, which ſometimes put a total ſtop to its regular adminiſtrations. Theſe bicker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings tended to demoralize the people. And repeatedly the people have ſuffered the evils of a fluctuating paper currency; which is a poiſon to the morals of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and one of the greateſt evils that can happen in ſociety. The war with England, and the ſubſequent proſperity, together with the French revolution, have all had a very deleterious effect upon
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:039104_0216_1013C493A4EE21D0"/>
morals.—In addition to theſe things, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts have openly attacked Chriſtianity, and their arguments being plauſible, have blinded the minds and injured the morals of thouſands. Falſe ideas of civil and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious liberty have likewiſe prevailed, and have had a tendency to weaken the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>But on the other hand we have ſome virtues which our fathers had not. We allow to all their juſt rights; and have laid aſide that perſecuting ſpirit which deprives others of liberty of conſcience. In this Commonwealth we have aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the infamous traffic in human fleſh.</p>
                  <p>When we compare our preſent ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with that of our anceſtors, we muſt be ſenſible, that our privileges far exceed theirs. The predatory war of the natives kept them in conſtant anxiety. This, however, had a tendency to unite them. And it is probable that they enjoyed the ſociety of each other, much better than we do at preſent. Common danger pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced mutual confidence, and ſympathy. Inſtead of that coldneſs, indifference, and envy towards each other, which are too prevalent at the preſent day, they were cordial friends. But if we are not happy
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:039104_0217_1013C4ED5F0452A8"/>
under the enjoyment of peace and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, the fault is our own, and it is an evidence that the enjoyment of privileges is not always productive of felicity.</p>

                  <head>The following obſervations were added by Mr. T. Prince, to the third edition, for the information of our younger peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</head>
                  <p>THE reverend author of the preceding hiſtory and ſermon, was a ſon of Mr. <hi>Samuel Williams</hi> of <hi>Roxbury</hi> where he was born <hi>Dec.</hi> 10, 1664; took his firſt degree at <hi>Harvard College</hi> in 1683, was ordained the firſt paſtor of the church in <hi>Deerfield,</hi> in <hi>May</hi> 1686.</p>
                  <p>And his firſt wife <hi>Eunice,</hi> murdered by the barbarous <hi>Indians,</hi> as before related, was the only daughter of the Rev. Mr. <hi>Eleazer Mather,</hi> firſt paſtor of the church in <hi>Northampton,</hi> by his only wife Mrs. <hi>Eunice,</hi> the daughter of the reverend and famous Mr. <hi>John Warham,</hi> formerly a miniſter in <hi>Exeter,</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> who came to <hi>New-England</hi> in 1630, was the firſt teacher with the Rev. Mr. <hi>Maverick,</hi> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the firſt church in <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> near
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:039104_0218_1013C4952C373E90"/>
                     <hi>Boſton,</hi> and in 1635, removed with the greater part of his church, to <hi>Windſor,</hi> on <hi>Connecticut River,</hi> where he continued their paſtor till he died: After the Rev. Mr. <hi>Eleazer Mather's</hi> death, his widow married the Rev. Mr. <hi>Solomon Stoddard,</hi> who ſucceeded him in the paſtoral office, at <hi>Northampton.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When <hi>Deerfield</hi> was deſtroyed in <hi>Feb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruary</hi> 1703-4, it was in the firſt year of my living at <hi>Harvard College;</hi> and I well remember how generally and greatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected were the good people of this prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ince, with that terrible diſaſter.</p>
                  <p>His eldeſt ſon <hi>Eleazer,</hi> being then in another town, eſcaped that calamity: The next commencement, by the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and help of divers charitable people, eſpecially in <hi>Boſton,</hi> he entered <hi>Harvard College,</hi> and living in the chamber over me, I fell into an intimate acquaintance with him; and found him a perſon of eminent piety, humility, ſincerity, and ſweetneſs of temper, like his father: He took his firſt degree in 1708, and became the faithful paſtor of the church in <hi>Mans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> in <hi>Connecticut,</hi> until he died.</p>
                  <p>His reverend father returning from

captivity, and arriving at <hi>Boſton, Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 21, 1706, to the great joy of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and being informed that he was to preach the public lecture there on <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> 6th; I, with many others, went down, and in an auditory exceedingly crouded and affected, I heard the ſermon herewith reprinted. And in thoſe times, there was ſuch a tender union, affection, and chriſtian ſimplicity, among the good people here; that as the apoſtle livelily deſcribes it; <q>When one member of the ſociety ſuffered, the whole body ſeemed to ſuffer with it; and when one rejoic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the whole rejoiced.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the like kind encouragement the Rev. Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> had his ſon <hi>Stephen Williams</hi> educated at <hi>Harvard College,</hi> who took his firſt degree in 1713; was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained paſtor of a church in <hi>Springfield;</hi> and is ſo extenſively known and valued, that his name only need to be mentioned; as that of his ſon <hi>Warham,</hi> who took his firſt degree in 1719, and became the worthy paſtor of the church in <hi>Waltham,</hi> formerly a part of <hi>Watertown;</hi> not long ſince deceaſed.</p>
                  <p>The Rev. Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> of <hi>Deerfield,</hi> uſed every <hi>May,</hi> yearly to come down to
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:039104_0220_1013C49AADCB1560"/>
the general <hi>convention</hi> of miniſters of the province, at <hi>Boſton;</hi> where he was always very affectionately entertained.</p>
                  <p>At the <hi>convention</hi> in <hi>May,</hi> 1728, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing choſen the year before) he preached a very moving ſermon to the miniſters: When I remember, he expreſſed his joy in the great advantage we at that time had above the preceding miniſters, in the <hi>general awakenings</hi> through the land, by the great earthquake in <hi>October.</hi> And on <hi>June</hi> 12, 1729, he died greatly beloved and lamented.</p>
                  <p>And by the accounts above, we may learn, from the inſtance of this one town only in our weſtern frontiers of the prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ince of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts Bay,</hi> in <hi>New-England</hi>—what horrible murders and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olations this province has ſuffered from the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> in all our wars with them ever ſince the year 1675, when the <hi>Indians</hi> firſt broke out upon us—and what numbers of the preſent people in <hi>Canada</hi> are the children of this province, or deſcendants from them—which, in caſe the ſovereign GOD ſhould ever lead a victorious army of ours into <hi>Canada,</hi> will clearly juſtify us to all the world, if we ſhould bring every child and deſcendant

                        <hi>Then Joſhua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Iſrael, out of every tribe a man. And Joſhua ſaid unto them, paſs over before the ark of the Lord your God into the midſt of Jordan, and take ye up every man of you a ſtone upon his ſhoulder, according unto the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the tribes of the children of Iſrael; That this may be a ſign among you, that when your children aſk their fathers in time to come, ſaying, what mean you by theſe ſtones? Then ye ſhall anſwer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, when it paſſed over Jordan the waters of Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan were cut off; and theſe ſtones ſhall be for a memorial unto the children of Iſrael forever.</hi>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>IT is a great truth, and highly important, that the ſame GOD who created the univerſe governs it. We have the fulleſt evidence that divine prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idence ſuperintends all human affairs: and that, as GOD is the author of all the good which is enjoyed or ſeen in this world, ſo there is no evil in the world and the LORD hath not done it. <hi>He forms the light and creates darkneſs, he makes peace and creates evil; the LORD does all theſe things.</hi> Nothing comes to paſs in the world, but by the ordering or permiſſion of divine providence. It would be well if we could always maintain a ſenſe of this great truth. But it is lamentably true, that
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:039104_0224_1013C4FD8C4C29B0"/>
we are very apt to look only at means and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, both in mercies and judgments, and take no notice of the hand that ſteers and conducts all things. I remember to have read a hiſtory of a voyage round the world, in which they who made it went through many and great perils and dangers, and were many times moſt marvelouſly delivered, and yet, which was a moſt unpardonable omiſſion, not the leaſt notice taken of GOD or providence. It is certainly our duty and wiſdom to be careful ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers of the works of divine providence. The pſalmiſt, after mentioning ſome of the works of providence, ſays, <hi>Whoſo is wiſe and will obſerve theſe things, even they ſhall underſtand the loving kindneſs of the LORD.</hi> Pſal. 107. 43.</p>
                  <p>IT is profitable, not only to obſerve the occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of our own day, but to read hiſtory, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the records of paſt ages; to take notice of the dealings of divine providence toward former generations. And while we are reading, we ſhould not forget what the Apoſtle ſays when he had been ſpeaking of GOD'S dealings towards the ancient Jews. All theſe things happened unto them for enſamples: and they are written for our admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon whom the ends of the world are come. 1 Cor. 10. 10.</p>
                  <p>GOD'S dealings with the Jews are one continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeries of wonders: and great care was taken in the ſacred hiſtory, to tranſmit the knowledge of them to poſterity. They are not only regiſtered in the ſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red records, but God directed that there ſhould be ſome viſible ſigns, and laſting monuments erected, to perpet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate the memory of ſome of his mighty acts. Thus he inſtituted the paſſover, to be a memorial of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance of his people out of their Egyptian bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age: and the LORD'S ſupper, to be an everlaſting memorial of the death of CHRIST, whereby we are
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:039104_0225_1013C4A4F2D0CDE8"/>
delivered from bondage infinitely worſe than that of Egypt. And when he divided Jordan for his people to go over and take poſſeſſion of the promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed land, he directed that a monument of ſtone ſhould be erected, to be a memorial of this miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous event, and to tranſmit the knowledge of it down to lateſt poſterity, as we learn from our text.</p>
                  <p>PRESENT things ſo engage our attention that we are apt to forget the paſt; we therefore need ſome ſigns, ſome viſible ſigns, to be remembrancers to us. And it is well that they ſhould be durable ſigns; otherwiſe the knowledge of them will die, if not with the preſent, yet before many generations are paſt. The children of Iſrael therefore were direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to erect a monument of ſtone, materials which decay not with time, ſo that if their children in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ages ſhould aſk their fathers, what mean you by theſe ſtones, they might anſwer them, that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, when it paſſed over Jordan: and theſe ſtones were deſigned to be a memorial of this event. The dividing of Jordan was a very notable miracle, and worthy to be kept in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</p>
                  <p>But not only the miraculous works of GOD, but many other works of divine providence, both mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful and corrective, are worthy to be had in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting remembrance. There are no people but what, at one time or another, are the ſubjects of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable providence; ſome of remarkable judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, others of ſignal mercies and deliverances: theſe ought to be carefully noticed in the time of them, and faithful annals kept of them, that ſo children may know what GOD did, for or againſt their fathers in their day. And it would be well
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:039104_0226_1013C5049049F7B8"/>
that not only the facts themſelves ſhould be regiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, but the moral cauſes both of mercies and judgments traced out, as far as we are capable of underſtanding them.</p>
                  <p>And here lies the peculiar excellency of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred hiſtory. Many profane hiſtorians give us a true and faithful account of the events which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the times of which they wrote; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they point out truly the way and manner in, and means by which theſe events were brought on: but the ſacred hiſtory, in addition to theſe, opens and explains to us the moral reaſons, why the great governor of the world conferred this public bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or granted this ſignal deliverance, or viſited his people with this ſore judgment. It is evident to every one who reads his bible, that GOD'S pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic dealing with the Jews was ſuited to their moral ſtate. If virtue generally prevailed among them, they flouriſhed and were happy; if vice and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs gained ground among them, they were viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with judgments of one kind or another: and if one judgment was not ſufficient to reform them, GOD ſent more and heavier, and as he threatened, Levit. 26. puniſhed them ſeven times more for their ſins. When they reformed he lightened his hand; and when they proved finally incorrigible, he gave them up to utter ruin. And GOD has, I doubt not, dealt much in the ſame way with other nations of the world, though their hiſtorians have been too negligent of making obſervations. They have given a faithful narration of the notable events which have happened, of the ſignal mercies and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances received, and of the calamities ſuffered, and of the immediate inſtruments by which they were brought about: but, which I think to have been a very great neglect, the moral cauſes have not been attended to or noticed by them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="231" facs="unknown:039104_0227_1013C50615CBC1F8"/>
IF the moral ſtate of paſt ages had been carefully noticed, and the conſequent dealings of GOD with them faithfully tranſmitted down to poſterity, it would have been highly uſeful to us, and have had, by the bleſſing of GOD, happy influence upon our own moral conduct. When we obſerved that in a courſe of virtue, our fathers flouriſhed and were happy, it muſt afford a powerful motive to their children to imitate them in their virtues and tread in their ſteps. When we ſaw their failings and their ſufferings on that account, it would naturally tend to put us upon our guard, and make us watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful not to ſplit upon the ſame rock. When we ſaw how quick the bright morning of proſperity was ſometimes ſucceeded by a dark night of adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and that hours of rejoicing were followed with days, yea months of mourning and weeping, one would ſuppoſe that we could not, in a time of proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, flatter ourſelves that our mountain ſtands ſtrong, and that we ſhall never be moved; that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow ſhall be as this day and much more abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant: but that we ſhould live conſtantly dependent upon GOD; and that although we ſhould rejoice in a day of proſperity, yet we ſhould rejoice as tho' we rejoiced not. When we took notice of any ſignal appearances of heaven for our fathers, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of their application to GOD and return to him, it would afford a mighty encouragement to us, to ſecure an intereſt in his ſpecial love and favour; to cry to him in our ſtraits; and to make our peace with him by a ſincere repentance, &amp; thorough reformation. When we read the accounts of the ſtraits, difficulties and dangers which our fathers underwent, and took notice how they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and carried through them, and delivered from them, it would afford the beſt ſecurity againſt ſinking and deſpondency in the day of trouble; it
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:039104_0228_1013C509AFAEC598"/>
would tend to inſpire us with courage and fortitude in a time of difficulty and danger. And when we took notice how, when they were ready to faint, GOD ſupported them, and when they were in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities and knew not what to do, and had their eyes unto him, he appeared, and perhaps in ways un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected, unthought of, brought deliverance to them, and ſurprized them with it, ſo that they were like men that dreamed; if any thing will, I ſhould think this would beget a firm unſhaken truſt in GOD, under the greateſt trials and dangers; and excite us to make GOD our refuge at all times, and repair to him, who is a preſent help in time of trouble: ſaying as in Hab. 3, 17, 18, 19. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the fig-tree ſhall not bloſſom, neither ſhall fruit be in the vine, though the labour of the olive ſhall fail; and the field ſhall yield no meat, and the flock ſhall be cut off from the field, and there ſhall be no herd in the ſtalls; yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the GOD of my ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The LORD GOD is my ſtrength, and he will make my feet like hinds feet, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE ſtudy of hiſtory is very pleaſant. There are very few, who have not ſome curioſity to look back into paſt time, and make themſelves acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with what was done before they were born. And people in general are peculiarly entertained with the hiſtory of their own country; they are fond of knowing their own origin, and pleaſed to be informed of every little incident which befell their own progenitors. We view ourſelves as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly concerned in the events which befell our parents; and though others may take no ſhare in them, yet children feel themſelves deeply intereſted in them.</p>

I HAVE often heard it lamented, that no more care was taken in the firſt ſettlement of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to preſerve the memory of the early tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our forefathers, of the many hardſhips and difficulties they endured in this wilderneſs, of the perils and dangers they endured, of the ſignal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances granted to them, and of the diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bleſſings conferred upon them, both of a ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual and temporal nature. It cannot be expected that the hiſtory of a new and infant ſettlement would be filled with the accounts of ſuch armies, battles and revolutions as are to be found in the annals of ancient ſtates and great kingdoms. But however unentertaining a minute, particular hiſtory of New-England might be to ſtrangers and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eigners, yet it <hi>would</hi> be read with pleaſure by us, and it <hi>might</hi> be read with profit and advantage to us. And perhaps no country of the ſame age has afforded more remarkables than New-England has to ſpeak of.</p>
                  <p>IT is now not quite one hundred and fifty ſix years ſince our fathers firſt began to form a ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at Plymouth. The firſt ſettlers were puritans, diſſatisfied with the eccleſiaſtical government of the church of England, and ſcrupulous of conforming to the ceremonies which were enjoined in their worſhip. For their non-conformity they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted in their Eccleſiaſtical Courts. To eſcape perſecution, they firſt fled to Holland, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome years at Leyden. Diſliking their ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there, they concluded to remove to America. In the ſummer of 1620 they ſet out on their voyage; and on the ninth of November diſcovered the land of Cape Cod. They had deſigned to form a ſettlement further to the ſouthward; but being brought hither, and the winter near at hand,
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:039104_0230_1013C510D8123370"/>
they concluded to ſet down here. After beating about upon the coaſt for divers weeks, and finding no place which ſuited them to make a ſettlement in, they at length pitched upon Plymouth; and in the latter end of December they went to work to prepare ſhelter for themſelves, their families and goods.</p>
                  <p>IT is obſerved, as a ſmile of heaven upon them, that contrary to their own intentions they were brought hither: had they gone further ſouthward, as they intended, to Hudſon's River, the country was full of ſavages: but here, GOD had before prepared room for them, by a ſweeping peſtilence which had depopulated the country.</p>
                  <p>THERE were no more than one hundred and one ſouls, who arrived in the harbour of Cape Cod. Winter was now ſet in, and they were utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided with every accommodation: and no oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Engliſh ſettlement on the continent, than a ſmall poor colony at Virginia; they ſix or ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles diſtant, and not able to afford them any help or relief. Under theſe circumſtances, they muſt have a moſt diſmal proſpect: Wherever they turned their eyes nothing but diſtreſs ſurrounded. However, liberty of conſcience was, with them, the grand object: they could not enjoy it in England; and if they might only enjoy it here, it would make amends for all; they therefore engaged with cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, in the new ſettlement, and underwent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible hardſhips, with fortitude; ſoon were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to great ſtraits, and within five months, one half their number were dead.</p>
                  <p>BESIDES the natural increaſe, there were from time to time, ſome additions made to them, by the arrival of ſome of their friends from England. But although the increaſe was but ſmall, yet it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, that whereas divers other attempts had
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:039104_0231_1013C5149A6E76D8"/>
been before made, from purely ſecular views, to make ſettlements within what was then called North Virginia, they had failed; this ſmall colony, who were influenced by religious motives, ſtood their ground, and were ſlowly increaſing; though greatly diſtreſſed; at ſometimes threatened to be cut off by the Natives, at other times greatly ſtraitened for want of bread; if I miſtake not, nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er receiving any ſupplies from Europe from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beginning.</p>
                  <p>THUS things went till the year 1628; when the conſul for New-England, having obtained a patent of the lands in the Maſſachuſetts-Bay, ſent Mr. Endicot, with his wife and a ſmall company, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin a ſettlement at Salem. The next year, they ſent three ſhips full of paſſengers, amounting to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two and three hundred; and among them four miniſters: theſe ſafely arrived, and took up their habitation chiefly at Salem; though ſome of them ſoon removed to Charleſtown, and with them one of the miniſters.</p>
                  <p>IN the ſpring of the Year 1639, there ſailed from England 10 or 11 ſhips, ſome of them very large, filled with paſſengers of every uſeful occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with many live cattle. In this fleet, which ſafely arrived early in the ſummer, were many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of ſubſtance; among whom were Governor Winthrop, Deputy Governor Dudley, and many of the patentees of the colony: and I find that Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iam Pynchon, <abbr>Eſq.</abbr> who was Treaſurer of the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and father of this town of Springfield, was one among them. Mr. Hubbard, in his hiſtory, ſays, that about this time there was ſuch increaſe made, by the occaſion of many hundreds who every year flocked after them, that in five or ſix years there were twenty conſiderable towns built and peopled; and many of the towns firſt planted became ſo filled
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:039104_0232_1013C519E67C37F8"/>
with inhabitants, that like bees they were ready to ſwarm into new plantations.</p>
                  <p>ONE of the ſwarms of which Mr. Hubbard ſpeaks, pitched in this town. It is ſtrange that any, in the then preſent ſtate of the country, ſhould be willing to be ſeparated ſo far from their brethren: but ſo early as May 1635, ſome of the inhabitants of Roxbury, Dorcheſter, New-Town and Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town prayed the General Court, (then ſitting at New-Town, now called Cambridge) that they might have liberty to remove to Connecticut River. This was granted to them, provided they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue under their juriſdiction. The grant is dated May 6th, 1635. In conſequence of this grant, the petitioners made their way, with their wives and children, into this wilderneſs, and laid the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the towns of Weathersfield, Hartford, Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor and Springfield.</p>
                  <p>THEY that planted themſelves down in this town came from Roxbury. It ſeems there were only eight men who came at firſt, one of which was the before-mentioned William Pynchon, <abbr>Eſq.</abbr> a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentee of the colony. They were here early in the year 1636. They entered into covenant with each other, which covenant is now upon your public rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ords; it is dated May 14th and ſigned by William Pynchon and ſeven others, who probably did not long continue here, as there is not, nor has been for many years, any of either of the names remaining among us. The firſt article in the covenant was, that they would, as ſoon as might be, provide a miniſter to carry on the work of GOD among them. Though they were thus few in number, in the midſt of the ſavages, not an Engliſh inhabitant within twenty miles, and they now beginning a ſettlement, yet they reſolved not to live without the Goſpel; an evidence of a true chriſtian zeal,
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:039104_0233_1013C51CC778B840"/>
which does honor to them, and is worthy the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and imitation of others.</p>
                  <p>THEY began well, and GOD bleſſed their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings. Some of their friends ſoon followed them from Roxbury; and many of the progenitors of the preſent inhabitants were early here: inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that, although at their firſt ſitting down, they did not think of having more than forty, or at fartheſt fifty families, yet I find by our public rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ords, that in February 1664, there were no leſs than ſeventy three male inhabitants in the town. And according to their covenant, they did early ſupply themſelves with a worthy miniſter, the Rev. Mr. George Moxon, who had, before he came to America, received, ordination in the church of England.</p>
                  <p>AT what time a church was firſt gathered in the town, I cannot aſcertain; but it appears, by your records, that Mr. Moxon was in the town in the year 1637, and continued here with his family fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years, till in the year 1652; when Mr. Pyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chon, the father of the town, having received ſome ill treatment from the province on account of his religious principles, he, with Capt. Smith his ſon in law, went to England, and with them went the miniſter of the town, the Rev. Mr. Moxon, never to return. This was a day of darkneſs with this town; I remember to have formerly heard ſome of the aged people, who had it from their forefathers ſay, that it went near to break up the ſettlement. But Mr. Pynchon left behind him a ſon, who was afterward a great bleſſing and very uſeful, not only here, but in the province. He lived to an advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed age, was had in the higheſt veneration by your fathers, and remembered by ſome who are now living.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="238" facs="unknown:039104_0234_1013C51E512A5150"/>
AFTER Mr. Moxon's departure, this town was deſtitute of a ſettled miniſter nine years. Mr. Hooker (probably he who afterwards ſettled at Farmington) for ſome time preached to the people. One Mr. Thompſon alſo preached among them, ſome part of the time; ſo that they were not for this ſpace deſtitute of the goſpel. At length Mr. Peletiah Glover a native of Dorcheſter, came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. I find by a note of Col. John Pyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chon, that the firſt ſermon he preached in the town was on July 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, 1659, from Jer. 4, 14. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued officiating here till 1661, when he was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to the miniſtry of the town. Mr. Hub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard gives this character of Mr. Glover, that he was a great ſtudent, and much given to books. He lived in great harmony with your fathers, and highly eſteemed, till March 29, 1692, when he gave up his charge, and the ghoſt, and went to reſt.</p>
                  <p>IN his time that great calamity befel the town, which is the ſpecial occaſion of our aſſembling this day. From the beginning of the country, our fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers had much trouble from the natives. They were often threatening them, frequently commenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hoſtilities againſt them, and many were killed in one place and another; and indeed it is marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that they were not all deſtroyed. If it had not been the LORD who was on our ſide, now may New-England ſay, If it had not been the LORD who was on our ſide, when the Indians roſe up againſt us; then they had ſwallowed us up, when their wrath was kindled againſt us.</p>
                  <p>HOWEVER, it is to be obſerved, that the people on Connecticut River lived in great harmony and peace with their Indian neighbours, till about the year 1675: When Philip's Indians, (this Philip was a great warrior, and a bitter enemy to the Engliſh; his place of reſidence was at Mount Hope,
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:039104_0235_1013C521F9326520"/>
now Briſtol) and thoſe called Nipnets, being driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en from the lower parts of the province, came weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and after deſtroying Brookfield, mixed themſelves with the Indians of this river, and ſoon diſaffected them to the Engliſh. The people of this town, and the towns above were alarmed, and began to fortify and prepare for their own defence. There were now ſettlements formed at Weſtfield, Hadley, Northampton, Hatfield, Deerfield and Northfield: though all weak and eſpecially the two latter.</p>
                  <p>THE Hadley Indians firſt of all, deſerted their fort and habitations, and joined the enemy. The Engliſh who were under Captains Lathrop and Bears, were ſo incenſed that they purſued them, and had a fight with them, at a place which was then, and is now called Sugar Loaf, oppoſite to the town of Sunderland; wherein nine or ten of the Engliſh were ſlain, and about twenty ſix Indians. About ſeven days after on the firſt of Sept. 1675 they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet the town of Deerfield, killed one man, and laid moſt of the houſes in aſhes. Two or three days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they made an attack upon Northfield, and kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nine or ten of the people; and the reſt hardly eſcaped into the garriſoned houſe. The next day, Capt. Bears with thirty ſix men was going to North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field to ſecure the garriſon there, when, about three miles on this ſide the town, he was waylaid by the enemy, and himſelf and about twenty of his men were killed, the reſt flying back to Hadley. On the eighteenth of the ſame month, as Capt. Lath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rop, with about eighty men, was guarding ſeveral carts, laden with corn and other goods, from Deer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field to Hadley, they were ſuddenly attacked, and almoſt all cut off, not above ſeven or eight eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. On the ſpot where they were buried, at a
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:039104_0236_1013C52A1C968310"/>
place called Muddy-Brook, was erected a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſtone, which now remains.</p>
                  <p>THESE things gave ſome alarm to the inhabitants of Springfield: though they were loath to diſtruſt their own Indians, with whom they had lived in great peace and amity for the ſpace of near forty years. However they were not wholly unprovid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: they had ſome garriſons, though I believe, not more than three in the town. The inhabitants treated with the Indians, and received from them, the firmeſt aſſurance of their friendſhip: and the Indians gave ſome hoſtages as a ſecurity for their peaceable behaviour; which hoſtages were ſent to Hartford, there to remain. Theſe hoſtages made their eſcape; and three hundred of Philip's Men were ſecretly received into the Indian fort up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Long-Hill. Their deſigns againſt the town were revealed by a Windſor Indian whoſe name was Toto; tidings of which, were in all haſte ſent to Springfield in the night: otherwiſe the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the town probably had been cut off, as well as their ſubſtance deſtroyed. The town was thrown into great conſternation, by the alarming advice from Windſor, and fled to their garriſons for ſafety. But two men, more unbelieving than the reſt, (on the morning of the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of October, 1675, according to old ſtile, now the 16th, this day one hundred years ſince) reſolved to go to the Indian fort<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſee whether theſe things were ſo. They ſet out; but had not come to Mill-River, before the Indians fired upon them, killed one on the ſpot, and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally wounded the other: However, he got back to a fort at the lower end of the ſtreet, and ſoon died. The Indians immediately ſet fire to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garriſoned houſes, and to the barns; and on that day laid almoſt the whole town in aſhes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="241" facs="unknown:039104_0237_1013C52BA2BC8460"/>
DEACON Burt, who was an eye witneſs, in a note made in the book of records, to perpetuate the memory of this melancholy event, ſays there were 29 dwelling houſes burnt; the number of barns he does not aſcertain. Major, afterwards Col. John Pynchon, who a few days before went to Hadley with a few ſoldiers to take care of the people in thoſe parts, in a letter which he wrote 15 days after the deſtruction of the town, to his ſon Joſeph then in England, gives a moſt melancholy account of their ſtate; he ſays there were about 30 or 32 dwelling houſes burnt, and 25 barns full of corn and hay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that although his own dwelling houſe was ſpared, his mills and barns and out houſes were all conſumed, with all his corn and hay; ſo that he had nothing left for food for man or beaſt. This letter I have in my hands; and it breathes ſuch a quiet, ſubmiſſive, patient, excellent ſpirit, that were there time, I would read the whole of it to you. Doctor Mather ſays, there were above 30 dwelling houſes, and above 20 out houſes burnt. Mr. Hub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard ſays 32 houſes were conſumed. Whether any buildings in this part of the town, except the forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied houſes, were ſaved, I am uncertain. Major Treat ſoon came from Weſtfield for their aſſiſtance, but for want of boats, could not paſs the river. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Pynchon with ſome forces from Hadley was with them as quick as poſſible, but too late to ſave the town.</p>
                  <p>BESIDES the two already mentioned, there was one woman killed, and ſeveral men wounded, one of which died ſoon after. There were ſome few inhabitants at Long-Meadow and I ſuppoſe ſome on the weſt ſide of the river; both theſe eſcaped.</p>
                  <p>IT is eaſy to ſee that this was a diſmal day with the forefathers of this town; that they were reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:039104_0238_1013C52D330DB7A8"/>
to great diſtreſs. It came upon them at a ſeaſon when all the fruits of the earth were gathered in; ſo that their year's ſtock of proviſion was conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and they had little or nothing left for man or beaſt; and none near them had any thing to ſpare to them. However, they did not faint: by the good providence of GOD they were carried through the winter. It was ſaid by the ancient people, that the following winter was remarkably favorable; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that they plowed their lands in the midſt of winter. The town was ſoon rebuilt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to its former ſtate; and has never ſince, ſuffered greatly by the Indians.</p>
                  <p>THERE was afterward a <hi>Leonard</hi> killed on the weſt ſide of the river; I ſuppoſe it was the father of thoſe of that name who now reſide there. At Pecowſick were ſix killed, the ſpring following the deſtruction of the town, three outright; two wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with their children, who were captivated, were overtaken, and one woman with the children killed; the other woman wounded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but recovered, and lived to an advanced age. And within the memory of ſome of you, (July 26, 1708) three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were killed in one houſe, at Skipmug; and a fourth that was captivated was ſoon after killed, and a lad, Benjamin Wright. Beſides theſe, I do not know that the Indians have done any other miſchief, except wounding one or two perſons, and captivating a few.</p>
                  <p>THERE was, in the winter or ſpring following the deſtruction of the town, a youth of the name of Edward Stebbins, (the grandfather of ſome here preſent) taken captive by the Indians at Long-Meadow; which, becauſe it was attended with ſome important conſequences, I particularly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He was carried to the Indian headquarters, which were then at the falls in this river a few
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:039104_0239_1013C530BB8D48F8"/>
miles above Deerfield. This youth with another whoſe name was Gilbert, found means to make their eſcape, and gave notice of the Indians place of rendezvous, and of the ſecurity in which they lived. Whereupon Capt. Turner, who, I take it, had the command of the ſoldiers in the garriſons, and Capt. Holyoke of this town, collecting about 150 men, partly out of the garriſons and partly from among the inhabitants, went againſt them: and a little before break of day on the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of May, 1676, fell upon the Indians undiſcovered, fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into their wigwams, and killed many on the place, many others in their fright plunged into the river, were carried headlong down the falls, and periſhed in the waters; and many who took ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter under the bank of the river were killed with the ſwords of our men. Mr. Hubbard ſays, that Capt. Holyoke killed five here with his own hand. We loſt 38 men in this fight; and ſome of their priſoners afterward owned, that they loſt more than 300, ſome of them principal men, Sachems, and ſome of their beſt warriors. It is obſerved, that they never recovered this defeat, but their ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in immediately followed. In reward of this ſignal ſervice, a townſhip of land where the fight was, now called Bernardſton, was granted to their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity.</p>
                  <p>I cannot find that more than ten or twelve per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have been killed by the Indians, within the limits of this town: ſave that Mr. Hubbard ſays, ſix or ſeven of our people, after our mills were burnt, going to a mill at Weſtfield, and going with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out arms, three of them were killed by the enemy. I have not been able to get any account who they were, nor any further account of this matter.</p>
                  <p>BUT the town has laboured under other, and grievous calamities at divers times. It is a griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:039104_0240_1013C53670AE6318"/>
and mortal ſickneſs which is now among us, and has put many parents into mourning. In the year 1760 and 1761, we were viſited with a ſore fever, which took off many uſeful and valuable men, in the midſt of their uſefulneſs, and greatly weakened our ſtrength. But the moſt diſtreſſing time the town ever ſaw by reaſon of ſickneſs, was in the year 1683, eight years after the town was burnt, (which by the ancient people of the town, was called the ſickly winter) when a violent fever raged in the town, to that degree that there were ſcarcely enough well to tend the ſick; the public worſhip was for ſome time ſuſpended, and twenty grown perſons died. In the year 1711, there was alſo a mortal ſickneſs which in the winter ſeaſon raged here, greatly diſtreſſed the people, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried off a number of the principal men. It was a diſtreſſing time with you in the year 1733, when your worthy Paſtor, and my Rev. Father and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate predeceſſor, Mr. Brown, after having ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you in the work of the miniſtry forty years, died, and with him a number of worthy men. Mr. Brewer was ordained your miniſter May 16, 1693, and continued with you till Nov. 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 1733, when he departed this life.</p>
                  <p>To him, through the providence of GOD, I, though unworthy, ſucceeded. The firſt ſermon I preached was on the 26th of May, 1734. I receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ordination January 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 1735, 6: And though exerciſed with much weakneſs and many infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet having obtained help from GOD, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue until this time. I ſuppoſe, I have lived with you longer than either of my predeceſſors; and longer than any miniſter in any part of the town, except the Rev. Dr. Williams, who is here preſent in the 83d year of his age, and has nearly complet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the 59th year of his miniſtry; in a comfortable
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:039104_0241_1013C53A36581048"/>
ſtate of health, and full poſſeſſion of his intellectual powers, he promiſes to be uſeful for years yet to come.</p>
                  <p>SINCE my entrance into the miniſtry here 476 have died, 1034 have received baptiſm, 298 have been admitted to full communion; there are only four, who are now living and continue with us, that were communicants at the time of my ordination. My work is near to an end: may I aſk your pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that I may be uſeful while I live, faithful to death, and then receive the crown of life.</p>
                  <p>THIS town is now 131 years old. The firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlers expected that the town would contain only 50 families at the moſt: but I preſume there may be, at this day, 600 within the ancient limits of Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field.</p>
                  <p>THE town was early divided into two pariſhes. In June 1698, a church was gathered in the 2d par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, and Mr. John Woodbridge ordained their Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. He continued 20 years in the miniſtry, and died in June, 1718. To him ſucceeded the Rev. Samuel Hopkins, who was ordained paſtor June 1ſt, 1720, and died October 6, 1755: a truly worthy man, and much beloved and eſteemed. On the 25th day of the following Auguſt, the Rev. Joſeph Lathrop was ordained, paſtor of that church: he ſtill lives, and has entered upon the 20th year of his miniſtry.</p>
                  <p>ON Feb. 17, 1713, Long-Meadow was made a pariſh: on the 16th of October 1716 a church was gathered there, and the Rev. Stephen Williams was ordained their paſtor.</p>
                  <p>ON June 24th, 1741, a church was gathered in the fourth pariſh in Springfield; and the Rev. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah Merick was ordained their paſtor. He is ſtill living. This pariſh was made a town in the year 1763.</p>

ON Sept. 27, 1752, a church was gathered in a fifth pariſh in the town; and the Rev. John M'Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry was ordained their paſtor.</p>
                  <p>ON Nov. 10, 1762, a church was gathered in a ſixth pariſh in Springfield; and on the 17th the Rev. Silvanus Griſwold was ordained their paſtor.</p>
                  <p>ABOUT two years ſince, another diſtrict was made in the town, by the name of Ludlow, which remains deſtitute of a ſettled miniſter. So that there are now, within the ancient limits of this town, ſeven worſhiping aſſemblies, beſides one who profeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Baptiſts.</p>
                  <p>How greatly are we increaſed beyond the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of our forefathers? The firſt ſettlers of the town, were they now upon earth, might with propriety adopt the language of Jacob and ſay, with our ſtaves paſſed we through this wilderneſs, and now we are become, not two, but ſeven bands.</p>
                  <p>MAY we be ſuitably affected with all the deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of divine providence towards our fathers and us, both merciful and corrective. We have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to ſpeak of as well as judgments: we have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the goſpel from the beginning; have had as much health as moſt towns; and perhaps no town has enjoyed more internal peace, with fewer inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, than the ancient town of Springfield. Though we have been divided into ſeveral pariſhes, for many years, and have had diſtinct intereſts; yet from my earlieſt acquaintance with the town, your fathers looked upon one another as brethren, and regard to the public intereſt was the governing principle. I have ever thought it a very happy circumſtance, that the leading men of this town have, from time to time, been not only men of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, but really friendly, both to your civil and religious intereſts.</p>

FOR my own part, I have ever eſteemed it a ſmile of Providence, that my lot was early caſt in the town of Springfield; and hope I may never have occaſion to change my ſentiments. I came here in my youth, not 21 years of age; and ſhall ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a grateful remembrance of the candor with which your fathers treated me, and many kind of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices which they did me. But few of that genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion remain. They are in the grave: and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forbear droping a tear at the remembrance of them. They were a worthy ſet of people: but they are gone; and this place which has known them, ſhall know them no more. And the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are riſen up in the ſtead of their fathers: may you, my dear people, prove yourſelves worthy of ſuch anceſtors.</p>
                  <p>How ſhort is human life! How quick does one generation ſucceed another! there are now upon the ſtage, ſome of the eighth generation of the fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily of the Pynchons in 139 years. My brethren, former generations are paſſed away, and this preſent generation muſt ſoon follow them, and make way for others. Within a few years, every ſingle perſon in this aſſembly will be in the grave. It is extreme folly in us, to ſet our hearts upon a world we muſt ſo ſoon leave; and it is our higheſt wiſdom to lay up treaſure in heaven; and prepare for that eternal ſtate, which ſucceeds this ſhort life.</p>
                  <p>HOWEVER though we ſhould not be careful of the many things of this world, to the neglect of the one thing needful, yet our preſent proſperity and happineſs is not to be wholly overlooked. And we ought to carry our views beyond the time of our own continuance here, and confeſs the good and happineſs of thoſe who ſhall ſucceed us on the ſtage of life. If we regard the happineſs of poſterity, let us take care to give our children a religious educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:039104_0244_1013C544D4F71890"/>
and ſit them to act their part well upon the theatre of the world, after we are retired to reſt and ſleep with our faihers.</p>
                  <p>NEW-ENGLAND has ſeen days of proſperity; they have alſo had their ſeaſons of adverſity. In their troubles, they truſted in GOD, and he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly granted them ſignal deliverances. Our fathers greateſt troubles were from the Natives, who, by the inſtigation of the French were often infeſting our frontier ſettlements. And multitudes have died by their barbarous hands.</p>
                  <p>WHEN, by the bleſſing of GOD upon our arms, in the laſt war with France, Canady was ſubjected to the obedience of the Crown of Great-Britain, we were ready to flatter ourſelves that our troubles were at an end; and that now we ſhould enjoy continual ſunſhine and peace: but the clouds are ſoon gathered again. It is now a day of darkneſs, not only with New-England, but the cloud has o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſpread all America: though <hi>we</hi> may expect to bear the weight of the ſtorm. Let us follow the good example of our pious progenitors: wait upon the LORD, and ſee to it that our ways pleaſe him, and we may hope that he will cauſe the enemies of America to be at peace with us.</p>
