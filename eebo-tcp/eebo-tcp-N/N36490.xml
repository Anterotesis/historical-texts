            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION BY THE PUBLISHER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>IT</hi> has been acknowledged that <hi>by our Addreſs to the Houſe of Repreſentatives,</hi> the Weſtern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try has had the credit of coming forward firſt to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> on the controverted queſtion. But, if I am not miſtaken in my judgment; it deſerves the credit, alſo, of having produced the beſt reaſoning on the queſtion, that has appeared, in, or, out of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. I have ſeen all that has appeared in the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zettes, as having been ſaid on this ſubject in the Houſe, but have found nothing equally ſatisfactory with this ſhort diſcuſſion. I have made an extract from it, for the ſake of thinking men, who may wiſh to be ſatisfied, as I have been, and may not have ſeen the Telegraphe. Let what will be thought of it at preſent, I will ſtake any reputation which it may be my ambition to poſſeſs as a literary man (and this, with that of moral ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, is the only ambition I ever had) that ultimately it will be conſidered, as having the <hi>weight of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,</hi> and equal to an <hi>authority in law;</hi> not from the place from whence it was given, but from its own intrinſic force of Argument.</p>
            <p>Let it not be underſtood from this eulogy, that I at all involve myſelf in any opinion with regard to the original expediency of treating with Great-Britain; or the merits of the treaty concluded with that power; nor with regard to the queſtion, <hi>where ought the treaty making power to be lodged.</hi> For the diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is wide of theſe ſubjects. I only declare myſelf to be one of thoſe who have believed that the acceptance of the Britiſh treaty by the Preſident and Senate gave it the validity of <hi>a conſtitutional contract, and that the national faith is pledged to fulfil it.</hi> Having expreſſed this opinion on public occaſions in this country, it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural for me to be pleaſed with ſeeing that opinion ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controvertibly eſtabliſhed; and it is not to ſupport the reaſoning that I give the voucher of my name; but to iuſtify my judgment that I publiſh the reaſoning.</p>

            <head>POSITION.</head>
            <p>THAT the treaty with Britain has acquired the ſanction of the American conſtitution, and our national faith is pledged to the word, that it ſhall be fairly carried into execution.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That a refuſal of the Houſe of Repreſentatives of the United States, to exerciſe their powers for its execution, would exhibit to the world a ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of a government at war with itſelf, one branch defeating the acts and purpoſes of another, the whole deprived of all energy and exertion, and in a ſtate of real or approaching diſſolution.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I am of opinion that the treaty with Britain, having been approved by two thirds of the Senate, and ratified by the Preſident, has acquired the ſanction of the American conſtitution, and, being ſo accepted and ratified by the King of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, our national faith is pledged to the world, that it ſhall be fairly carried into execution.</p>
            <p>My poſition is, that a treaty approved by two thirds of the Senate, and ratified by the Preſident, and accepted by the other nation, has all the force of a law. As to ſome treaties, this is admitted: but it ſeems to be contended that there are treaties which need a ſubſequent law to give them effect, and that where a treaty either oppoſes a former law or needs a ſubſequent law to give it effect, it is not valid, till, the former law be repealed, or the law to give it effect be enacted; and that it is diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary with the Houſe of Repreſentatives, to repeal or enact the laws neceſſary for the effect of the treaty. The difference of opinion ariſes therefore out of the ſubject of the treaty. The conſtitution is the teſt of the true opinion; and the queſtion here is, not what the conſtitution ought to be, but what the conſtitution is.</p>
            <p>The conſtitution declares, "that the Preſident of the United States ſhall have power, by and with the advice and conſent of the Senate, to make treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent coucur;<note n="*" place="bottom">ART. II. § 2. ART. VI.</note> and that all treaties made, or which
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:047694_0005_1024420FFB11E708"/>ſhall be made, under the authority of the United States, ſhall be the ſupreme law of the land."</p>
            <p>From the expreſſion of "treaties made under the authority of the United States," it cannot be inferred, that there may be treaties to which the ſanction of the Houſe of Repreſentatives as well as of the Preſident and Senate, is neceſſary. The true conſtruction of the words will not juſtify this inference. It was not intended to make all trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties the law of the land, but only treaties made under the authority of the United States. The Preſident is the agent of the United States for making treaties, his authority is theirs, and treaties made by him are made under the authority of the United States. As it was intended to declare treaties made under the confederation the law of the land, as well as treaties under the conſtitution, it would have been abſurd to have ſaid treaties made by the Preſident, for this would not have applied to the paſt treaties made by the former Congreſs.</p>
            <p>Neither do I think, that the authority given to Congreſs by the Conſtitution "to regulate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with foreign nations, and among the ſeveral ſtates, and with the Indian tribes,"<note n="†" place="bottom">ART. I. § 8.</note> excludes, by implication, the authority of the Preſident to make comercial treaties, or renders the aſſent of the Houſe of Repreſentatives neceſſary to the validity of a commercial treaty. The excluſion is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, nor, as without it a plain uſe of the words appears, is it neceſſary to be implied. The great defect of the confederation was that Congreſs had not authority to make laws for the regulation of trade binding on all the ſtates in their foreign and mutual trade. This authority was in the ſeveral ſtate legiſlatures, and they would not agree to any uniform regulation. To ſupply this defect, the conſtitution gave Congreſs authority to regulate trade with foreign nations and among the ſeveral ſtates; but it does not therefore follow that the Preſident could not alſo regulate trade with foreign nations by treaties. The end to be accompliſhed
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:047694_0006_10244211E433A3A0"/>was not an equality of each foreign nation but of each of the United States. A regulation made by the Preſident being uniform throughout the ſtates as well accompliſhed the end in view, as any regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation made by Congreſs: and being by way of contract with a foreign nation, might be more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous, by mutual conceſſions. If regulations made by the Preſident could be more advantageous than regulations made by Congreſs; it is not to be inferred, that the authority of Congreſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate excluded the authority of the Preſident to regulate. Nor did the authority of the Preſident to regulate, ſupercede the neceſſity of an authority in Congreſs to regulate. For all nations might not be diſpoſed to treat. It was therefore neceſſary to give Congreſs an authority to regulate by law which would be compulſory on the foreign traders as well as on the ſeveral ſtates. Thus, at all events, an uniform regulation would be eſtabliſhed. The regulation by treaty operates by the conſent of the foreign nation. The regulation by law operates without conſent. The one is a contract, the other a conſtraint. The treaty may be more advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. The law ſecures, in every caſe, uniformity throughout the ſtates, though perhaps a leſs bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial uniformity than that eſtabliſhed by treaty. It may therefore be proper, that both authorities ſubſiſt, and the expreſſion of the one does not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the other. How ſtands the caſe then on the face of the conſtitution. The Preſident has autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to conclude treaties, treaties are laws; as the authority of the Preſident, to make commercial treaties, did not ſuperſede the neceſſity of an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in Congreſs, to make commercial laws, which would operate on nations that would not treat, neither did this authority of Congreſs to make commercial laws, ſuperſede the authority of the Preſident to make commercial treaties, for they may be more advantageous by means of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual conceſſions. They are ſeparate ſubſiſting au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thories, each operating without the aid of the other.</p>
            <p>If this be the plain meaning of the conſtitution, it is not to be controverted by precedents from
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:047694_0007_1024421548A662D0"/>Britain, where there is no conſtitution, but a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of uſages and incroachments; where the King is hereditary, his council is appointed by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and removable at his pleaſure, and the parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament is at his devotion, and where there is no reſemblance to our Preſident, our Senate, and our Houſe of Repreſentatives.</p>
            <p>If there were any doubt, on the face of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, that its meaning is as I have ſtated, the ſtatement made by the Preſident, in his anſwer to the demand for the papers muſt intirely remove it. But as the diſcloſure which he there makes, that the general convention had explicitly rejected the propoſition, that "no treaty ſhould be binding on the United States, which was not ratified by law," could not have dictated to us the terms of our pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition; it may be proper to enter into a more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute detail of the hiſtory of this authority.</p>
            <p>All governments have two relations, from each of which certain duties ariſe, a relation to their own citizens, and a relation to foreign nations.— The duties ariſing out of the relation to their own citizens are pointed out by laws, enacted by the legiſlature, and carried into effect by the executive and the judiciary. The duties ariſing out of the relation to foreign nations are pointed out by the general law of nations, and by the conventional law of nations, or treaties, which are ſpecial laws binding thoſe nations which enter into them; and the declaration and execution of theſe duties are generally committed to the executive only or chiefly, as the proper organ of communication with foreign nations<note n="‡" place="bottom">It was probably on this principle, that diſtrict courts of the United States refuſed to examine prize cauſes. The ſuperior court might perhaps have thought that the exerciſe of this authority by the judiciary would be leſs invidious to foreign nations: and, as judges were to decide on treaties, they might as well decide on the law of nations in all its parts.</note> It is the duty of every na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to eſtabliſh in it an organ of communication
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:047694_0008_1024421947251A00"/>with other nations: and to the executive it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally conſided, to aſcertain what is the law of nations, and to form treaties, which are ſpecial laws of the treating nations, altering, enlarging, diminiſhing, or otherwiſe modifying, the general law of nations, with reſpect to the treating nations. Theſe treaties create new rights and duties, of a poſitive nature, between the treating nations, the violation of which is a violation of a perfect right, and, therefore, an injury, and a cauſe of war.</p>
            <p>Previous to the revolution, we had no relation to any foreign nation; we were colonies, provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or appendages to Britain, and we could form no treaty with any nation. The Congreſs, which met at Philadelphia in 1774, was a Congreſs of colonies. Each colony had one vote in Congreſs. Engaged in a common cauſe, and abandoning all hope of reunion with Britain, Congreſs, without any expreſs authority, but as the reſult of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral truſt, conſidered itſelf as a proper organ of a joint communication of all the colonies with fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign nations. Accordingly, after they had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a committee for preparing a declaration of independence, they reſolved on the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a committee, to prepare a form of confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and a committee to prepare a plan of treaties to be propoſed to foreign powers. In purſuance of this, Congreſs propoſed treaties with France and with Spain; and a treaty of alliance, and a treaty of amity and commerce between France and the United States of New-Hampſhire, &amp;c. were concluded by their commiſſioners at Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, in February 1778, and ratified by Congreſs in May 1778, before the ratification of the articles of confederation.</p>
            <p>Though the declaration of independence put theſe colonies in a capacity of treating, by declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them free and independent ſtates; they were thirteen free and independent ſtates; each of which, though all connected in a general cauſe, like the Swiſs Cantons, or the German Princes, might enter into a ſeparate treaty with any foreign nation. The confederation gave no authority to
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:047694_0009_1024421D46CD7480"/>Congreſs to regulate trade. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

But, though it declared, that each ſtate retained its ſovereignty and independence, it ordained, "that no ſtate ſhould, without the conſent of the United States in Congreſs aſſembled, ſend any em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſy to, or receive any embaſſy from, or enter into conference or agreement, alliance or treaty with, any king, prince or ſtate,<note n="*" place="bottom">ART. 6.</note> and that the United States in Congreſs aſſembled ſhould have the ſole and excluſive right and power of entering into treaties and alliances, provided that no treaty of commerce ſhould be made, whereby the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power of the reſpective ſtates ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained from impoſing ſuch impoſts and duties on foreigners, as their own people are ſubjected to, or from prohibiting the exportation or importation of any ſpecies of goods whatſoever:<note n="†" place="bottom">ART. 9.</note> but they were to enter into no treaties or alliances, without the aſſent of nine of the ſtates."<note n="‡" place="bottom">9.</note> It was alſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, "that no ſtate ſhould lay any impoſts or duties, which may interfere with any ſtipulations in treaties entered into by the United States in Congreſs aſſembled, with any king, prince or ſtate, in purſuance of any treaties already propoſed by Congreſs, to the courts of France and Spain."<note n="¶" place="bottom">6.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Before the confederation, Congreſs concluded their treaty of alliance, and treaty of amity and commerce with France, by virtue of their general implied authority, as proper organs of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with foreign nations.</p>
            <p>Under the confederation, Congreſs concluded a treaty of amity and commerce with Holland, a treaty of peace with Britain, a treaty of amity and commerce with Sweden, a treaty of amity and commerce with Pruſſia, a treaty of peace and friendſhip with the Emperor of Morocco, and ſix Indian treaties.</p>
            <p>Congreſs concluded theſe treaties by virtue of the expreſs authority of the confederation, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into treaties on the aſſent of nine of the ſtates. This aſſent of nine ſtates was of nine ſtates in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:047694_0010_1024421F6AB90AD0"/>aſſembled. For this was a Congreſs of ſtates. Each ſtate might have not leſs than two nor more than ſeven repreſentatives; but each ſtate had but one vote. If all the repreſentatives of any ſtate agreed in opinion, the votes of all made but one vote; if they differed in opinion, and were une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually divided, the vote of the majority was the vote of the ſtate; if they differed in opinion, and were equally divided, the ſtate was confidered as not voting. So that if all the repreſentatives, or a majority of the repreſentatives, of each of nine ſtates in Congreſs, aſſented to atreaty, it was ratified.</p>
            <p>The authority given to Congreſs by the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration to enter into treaties included an authority to enter into commercial treaties; and, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial treaties, to reſtrain the ſtate legiſlatures otherwiſe there would have been no need for the proviſion that no treaty of commerce ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the ſtate legiſlatures from impoſing ſuch du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties on foreigners as on their own people.</p>
            <p>Though Congreſs had not authority to regulate trade by law, for this authority remained in the ſtate legiſlatures, it had authority to regulate trade by treaty, which, except in the excluded caſe, reſtrained the authority of regulating by law, and rendered void all contrary laws, except in the caſe reſerved. The external relation was committed to the care of Congreſs, the internal to the ſtate legiſlatures. A treaty is a contract between two nations, and binds both, as a law which neither of them has authority to repeal without the aſſent of the other. The confederation provided for the validity of the treaties entered into before; becauſe the ſtates had not before given Congreſs any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs authority to make treaties. But the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration ſays nothing, as to treaties to be made under its authority, not ſuppoſing it neceſſary to provide for their validity; becauſe the authority given to make treaties neceſſarily implied their obligation when made. No law of any ſtate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was neceſſary for confirming a treaty: for a treaty made under the authority given by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federation was from its nature a law of all the ſtates, and could not be made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:047694_0011_10244221C8D24918"/>ſuperaddition of any other nor could it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled by the law of any ſtate; but was the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme law of the land. This was a ſettled princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and wherever it did not operate in practice, it was not becauſe its authority could be denied, but from collateral cauſes. This is clearly eſtabliſhed by Mr. Jefferſon in his admirable letter to Mr. Hammond.</p>
            <p>So ſtood the authority of treaties under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federation. The conſtitution veſted in Congreſs the power, formerly retained by the ſeveral ſtates, to regulate commerce; and in the Preſident by and with the advice and conſent of the Senate, the power to make treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators preſent concur; and expreſsly declared all treaties, made and to be made, the ſupreme law of the land. This arrangement ſubſtituted the legiſlature of the United States in place of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlatures of the ſeveral ſtates, for the purpoſe of making laws to regulate trade; and the Preſident of the United States with the concurrence of two thirds of the Senators preſent, in place of nine of the thirteen ſtates in Congreſs aſſembled, for the purpoſe of making all treaties. The firſt was charged with the internal, the laſt with the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal relation. The effect or validity of treaties, when made, is only declared, it is not enlarged, And the declaration was probably made to remove all pretence of objection, which Britain could make to our inexecution of the treaty of 1783.</p>
            <p>The conſtitution gave to the Preſident, with two thirds of the Senate, the ſame power which the confederation gave to the whole Congreſs of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing treaties, and more, for it does not annex the proviſion, annexed by the confederation, that no treaty of commerce ſhould reſtrain a ſtate legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, from impoſing the ſame duties on foreigners, as on its own people. The power of Congreſs to make treaties was ſole and excluſive of the ſtate legiſlatures; the power of the Preſident and two thirds of the Senate is ſole and excluſive of the Houſe of Repreſentatives. The power of Congreſs to make treaties, included a power to make com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:047694_0012_10244225101B3AE0"/>treaties, notwithſtanding the power to re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gulate trade was not given to Congreſs, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the ſtate legiſlatures; the power of the Preſident and two thirds of the Senate, to make treaties includes a power to make commercial trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, notwithſtanding the power to regulate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce is veſted in Congreſs. Congreſs had power to make all treaties, ſubject to one exception, the Preſident and two thirds of the Senate have power to make all treaties, without any exception. The conſtitution was framed as a ſubſtitute for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federation, and its framers muſt have had the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federation in view; and as the confederation diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhes commercial from other treaties, and the conſtitution does not, it is evident that the framers of the conſtitution meant no diſtinction; but gave to the Preſident and two thirds of the Senate, the power of making all treaties. Under the confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, nine ſtates made two thirds of the number of ſtates then exiſting in Congreſs. The framers of the conſtitution forſaw an increaſe of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſtates, when nine would not be two thirds; the conſtitution therefore fixes the ſame proportion, without naming the number, and makes the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of two thirds of the Senate neceſſary to the validity of a treaty.</p>
            <p>Prejudices, habits, and local intereſts, are not eaſily ſubdued. Each of the ſtates was a ſovereign ſtate, and all ſovereigns are equal. Under the confederation therefore they all met with an equal voice in Congreſs. The large ſtates had long complained of this, and claimed votes in proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the number of their citizens. The ſmall ſtates aſſerted their ſovereignty, and conſequent equality, and conſidered this as entirely drowning their voice in Congreſs. On this principle, Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia alone would now have more votes than New-Hampſhire, Vermont, Rhode-Iſland, New Jerſey, Delaware, Kentuckey and Georgia put for other; and Maſſachuſetts, New-York, Pennſylvania and Virgina would have more votes, than all the other eleven ſtates in the Union. It was not to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that the ſmall ſtates would agree to this;
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:047694_0013_1024422694E42118"/>and, in the Convention, the claims on both ſides were ſo compromiſed, that votes ſhould be accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to numbers in the Houſe of Repreſentatives, and according to ſtates in the Senate, in other words that each ſtate ſhould ſend two Senators, and repreſentatives in proportion to its number; and that every member ſhould have one vote. Thus each of the ſmall ſtates retained its equal voice in the Senate; and, as a further ſacrifice to the ſmall ſtates, that branch alone in which they were all equal was permitted to concur in treaties. Thus the matter was put, as nearly as poſſible, on the footing on which it ſtood, under the confeder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. Under the confederation, treaties were made with the concurrence of two thirds of the ſtates in Congreſs aſſembled; each ſtate had one vote and its delegates to Congreſs were choſen by its own legiſtatures. Under the conſtitution, treaties are made with the concurrence of two thirds of the Senate; each ſtate has two Senators, and they are choſen by its own legiſlature. Under the conſederation a law of a ſtate could neither increaſe nor diminiſh the validity of a treaty. Under the conſtitution, a law of Congreſs can neither encreaſe nor diminiſh the validity of a commercial treaty. A law is the act of one party only, a treaty is on mutual ſtipulations with another.</p>
            <p>Under the confederation, congreſs concluded ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven treaties, ſome of which were commercial trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſome ſettled limits, ſome ſtipulated for the payment of money, ſome defined pliacy &amp;c. Muſt not the framers of the Conſtitution have had theſe in their view: in examining the treaty pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the confederation, muſt they not have exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the manner and objects of its exerciſe; and it they had meant that it ſhould be abridged, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conſtitution would they not have done ſo expreſsly? If they gave it generally, as it had been given by the confederation; muſt we not ſuppoſe, that they meant it ſhould be exerciſed, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </gap> convention explicitly rejected ſuch concurrence.</p>
            <p>When the conſtitution, previous to its adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, became a ſubject of public diſputation, its op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents attacked and its advocates defended, but all admitted this extent of power of the Preſident with two thirds of the Senate in making treaties.</p>
            <p>When the ſtate conventions met to ratify the conſtitution, it was there conſidered with all this extent of power, and, in this ſhape, was cenſured, defended, and ratified. Some of theſe conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons propoſed amendments to it. The ſeventh amendment propoſed by the convention of Virginia is "That no commercial treaty ſhall be ratified, without the concurrence of two thirds of the <hi>whole number</hi> of the members of the Senate; and no treaty, ceding, contracting, reſtraining or ſuſpending the territorial rights or claims of the United States or any of them, or their, or any of their rights or claims to fiſhing in the American ſeas, or navigating the American rivers, ſhall be made but in caſes of the moſt urgent and extreme neceſſity; nor ſhall any ſuch treaty be ratified, without the concurrence of three fourths of the whole number of the members of both houſes reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectively." The ſeventh amendment propoſed by the convention of North Carolina is in the ſame words. The twenty-third amendment propoſed by that convention recommends, that no treaty, which ſhall be directly oppoſed to the exiſting laws of the United States in Congreſs aſſembled, ſhall be valid until ſuch law ſhall be repealed, or made conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſuch treaty.</p>
            <p>Theſe amendments ſhew that the conventions underſtood the effect of a treaty made by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident with the concurrence of two thirds of the Senators preſent, in its full extent; that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that unleſs the firſt amendment was made, the Preſident, had power with the concurrence of two thirds of the Senators <hi>preſent</hi> to make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial treaty, or any other treaty, without the concurrence of any of the members of the Houſe of Repreſentatives, that every treaty ſo made had the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:047694_0015_1024422D79D82E88"/>force of a law, notwithſtanding any previous, exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, contrary law. So far I think, they underſtood the Conſtitution truly; and gave treaties no more force than with the exception of the caſes reſerved, they had under the confederation. In purſuance of the propoſitions of amendment, by ſeveral of the conventions, Congreſs afterwards recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome of them to the conſideration of the ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſtates; but neither of the amendments reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing treaties was among the number; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution remains without thoſe amendments.</p>
            <p>I could purſue this unvaried conſtruction of the conſtitution down to the preſent ſeſſion of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs; but I confider the conſtitution itſelf, with thoſe previous and cotemporary elucidations, ſo clear and deciſive, that they who will not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded by thoſe, would not be perſuaded though one roſe from the dead.</p>
            <p>By virtue of this conſtitutional authority, the Preſident has concluded a conſular convention with France, relative to commerce and navigation, various treaties with Indian nations, a treaty with Britain, a treaty with Algiers, and a treaty with Spain.</p>
            <p>No law of any ſtate was ever neceſſary, for the validity of any treaty made under the confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; though the ſtate legiſlatures had then, as congreſs has now, the power to regulate trade with foreign nations And it would be difficult to point out any principle in the Britiſh treaty, which is not to be found in ſome, in ſeveral, or in each of the former and ſubſequent treaties. I therefore believe, that it, like them, has acquired the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the American conſtitution.</p>
            <p>To bring the preceding points into one view, I recapitulate. Every nation has an external and internal relation; and ought to provide conductors of both. Under our confederation, Congreſs was charged with external relation. Congreſs had not power to regulate trade by law; but it had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to make treaties, and by treaties to regulate trade, and all treaties under their authority were laws without any aid of ſtate laws; though the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:047694_0016_10244230CA37B130"/>ſtate legiſlatures alone had power to regulate trade by law. Congreſs did make treaties to regulate trade. The conſtitution charges the Preſident with the external relation, gives him authority, with the concurrence of two thirds of the Senate, to make treaties. This, without limitation, muſt mean all ſuch treaties, as Congreſs, before had au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to make; and they had authority to make, and did make, commercial treaties. All treaties, made under the authority of the United States, are the ſupreme law of the land. Nothing can add to the obligation of a law; for that would ſignify, that a law is not binding. Therefore, though Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs be charged with the internal relation to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, not being excluſively charged with the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of trade, a commercial treaty needs no law of Congreſs, to make it binding on the nation. Every agent, who exceeds not his authority, binds his principal. The Preſident is the agent of the nations for making all treaties, commercial trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties included, with the concurrence of two thirds of the Senate; other nations treat with him, as out agent, in confidence of this; and the faith of the United States is pledged to the world, that all treaties ſo made by him, under their authority, ſhall be fairly carried into execution.</p>
            <p>The principle contended for, that a law may be neceſſary to give relidity to a treaty, and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple rejected by the convention, that a treaty be not binding till it be ratified by law, are preciſely the ſame. If it be admitted, that the houſe of repreſentatives claim no agency in making, it muſt be admitted, that a treaty is made, when, with the concurrence of two thirds of the Senate, it is ratified by the Preſident; and if a treaty made be a law; what can be added to its validity? Can it be made more than a law?—No law can add to the validity of a treaty made under the authority of the United States, for the conſtitution declares it the ſupreme law of the land.</p>
            <p>That a law may be neceſſary, as, in the caſe of the Britiſh treaty, a law is neceſſary, to carry a treaty into execution, is a principle altogether
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:047694_0017_102442325659FC20"/>different, and proceeds from a part of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not at all connected with treaties, and equally applicable to the execution of every act of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, which requires money for its execution. It is declared by the conſtitution, that no money ſhall be drawn from the treaſury, but in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of appropriations made by law. A law making an appropriation of money for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, is therefore neceſſary for obtaining the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and obtaining the money is neceſſary for the execution of the treaty.</p>
            <p>A treaty is a contract between two nations, by which both are bound, and every branch and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual of both. Like every other contract, its execution is the end in view on either ſide. If this be not accompliſhed, the end of the contract is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated, the contract is broken. The contract eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhes poſitive rights and duties, on either ſide, which neither is at liberty to fruſtrate or evade. A law, in which none but the nation itſelf is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, may be repealed or neglected, at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the nation. But a treaty is a law in which two nations are concerned, and a breach or inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of it is a violation of a poſitive right, and a juſt cauſe of war, if the other party chooſe to make it ſo. A treaty made under the authority of the United States engages the faith of the United States to a foreign nation, that every branch or individual of our government ſhall aſſiſt in carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it into execution; and a breach of this engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a breach of national faith, and a ſtain on national honour. The Preſident is the agent of the United States for making this engagement, he acts under their authority, a treaty made by him, with the concurrence of two thirds of the Senate, is a treaty made under the authority of the United States, and a law of the United States, in which the intereſts of another nation are concerned, and which therefore no branch of the government of the United States is juſtifiable in refuſing its au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to execute, unleſs it can be juſtifiable in violating the poſitive right of another nation, and giving juſt cauſe of war. The only diſcretion,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:047694_0018_10244235CCC86E30"/>therefore, that I can perceive, in any branch of this government, in refuſing appropriations for the execution of a valid treaty, is a diſcretion of doing injuſtice and injury. The people, by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, have made the Preſident their agent for the purpoſe of making treaties. Whether in any treaty, he makes the beſt bargain for them they have ſubmitted to the judgment of the Senate only, to enquire If two thinds of the Senate concur, that he has, and approve the treaty, and he ratifies it; it has the ſanction of the American conſtitution, and the Houſe of Repreſentatives are bound by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional juſtice, and national faith, to concur, if neceſſary, in carrying it into execution.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe the treaty to be valid, that is, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the Preſident in making it, has not exceeded the authority given to him, by the United States. Ours is a government of departments, or branches, the authority of each of which is preſcribed by the conſtitution; if any branch exceed its authority, its act is void; if it exceed not its authority, its act, though not ſo good as it might be, is binding; for the people, by their conſtitution, gave this autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to its diſcretion. To the diſcretion of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, with the check only of two thirds of the Senate, the people of the United States has ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the authority of making treaties. Whether in making a treaty, he has made as good a bargain as the Houſe of Repreſentatives could have made, the conſtitution permits them not to enquire; but only whether he has exceeded his authority. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the conſtitutional limits, the Preſident, in the exerciſe of his authority in making treaties, is like every other national agent for this purpoſe, bound by what may be called the <hi>common</hi> law of nations on this point. There is a ſupreme law, the ſafety of the nation, which no treaty agent can violate; and in all nations, without any written conſtitution, a treaty endangering the exiſtence and ſafety of the nation is void; and the nation to be injured by it, may, without any breach of the law of nations, explain this danger to the other nation, and decline the execution of the treaty. Shylock's bargain
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:047694_0019_102442381234B888"/>with the merchant of Venice was clearly void. I conceive therefore that, the Houſe of Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, in their deliberations on the expediency of carrying the Britiſh treaty into effect, can enquire only whether the Preſident has exceeded his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional, or general authority to make treaties; if he has not, it has acquired the ſanction of the American conſtitution, and they are bound by it, while this conſtitution ſubſiſts. Whether the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican people are diſſatisfied with this part of their conſtitution, and deſire a change in it, cannot come into view on this queſtion, but may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards be aſcertained, in a regular and conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal way.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I conceive alſo, that a refuſal of the Houſe of Repreſentatives of the United States, to exerciſe their powers for the execution of the Britiſh trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, would exhibit to the world, the ſpectacle of a government at war with itſelf, one branch defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the acts and purpoſes of another, the whole deprived of all energy and exertion, and in a ſtate of real or approaching diſſolution.</p>
            <p>I have ſaid, that the treaty, appearing to have been conſtitutionally concluded, and to be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to this nation, is the ſupreme law; that this being a government of branches, each branch is bound to exerciſe its authority for the execution of laws; and this being a law to which another nation is a party, all the branches of government are bound by it.</p>
            <p>There is a department of external, and a depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of internal relations. The departments are not eſtabliſhed to obſtruct each other in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their conſtitutional authority, but to check the uſurpation of unlawful power by any. While one department exerciſes its own diſcretion within its conſtitutional limits it is not diſcretionary with any other, whether it will exert its conſtitutional authority to give effect to the acts of the firſt; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be diſcretionary to ſtop the operations of the government, and defeat the proviſions of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. Each department, called on to decide on the complete acts of another, may examine its
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:047694_0020_1024423B9F9645F0"/>authority, not its diſcretion. Where there is au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, mutual co-operation, not mutual obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becomes the duty. When a law is complete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made, every branch of government, whoſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is neceſſary for its execution, is bound to interpoſe its authority for its execution, while it ſubſiſts. Suppoſe inſtead of a Britiſh, this had been a French treaty, as much applauded, as this has been cenſured; and having been, with great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, approved in the Senate, by twenty votes againſt ten, it had received the Preſident's ratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and nothing remained, but an appropriating law, for its complete operation. But before this law paſſed, ſix of the twenty went out, and ſix new Senators ſucceeded, who all hated the treaty, and were determined to defeat it. Here now the twenty ſink to fourteen, and the ten riſe to ſixteen. An appropriating bill comes up from the Houſe of Repreſentatives, which had paſſed there unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly. The Senate reject it. In my opinion, the rejection by the Senate would be contrary to duty, and the principles of our government. I think their diſcretion expired, when they concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the treaty: and as to appropriation, I think it a thing of courſe, an act of poſitive duty, and the refuſal a violation of conſtitutional principles. To give a power to defeat, is in fact requiring an aſſent to eſtabliſh. Refuſing appropriation is a power to defeat. And to ſay that it is diſcretionary with the Houſe of Repreſentatives, by refuſing an appropriation, to defeat the execution of a treaty, is to ſay, that they have, what the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution has refuſed them, an authority to confirm or reject a treaty. Any branch the exerciſe of whoſe diſcretion is neceſſary to make a law, may uſe its diſcretion, in either making or rejecting it. But when a law is made, no branch, whoſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is neceſſary for its execution, has any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion in refuſing its interpoſition. A valid treaty is made without any interpoſition of the Houſe of Repreſentatives. A valid treaty is a law. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation is its execution. Appropriation can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made without the interpoſition of the Houſe
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:047694_0021_1024423DF3227440"/>of Repreſentatives. It therefore becomes an act of duty in them, to make the appropriation, and they have no diſcretion to reſuſe it; unleſs they have a diſcretion to refuſe to perform a poſitive duty. The refuſal exhibits a government at war with it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Infult to one branch might provoke retalia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The genuine dictates of the conſtitution would be diſregarded by all; one branch would defeat the acts of another; and the government would be deprived of all energy and exertion, and in a ſtate of real or approaching diſſolution.</p>
            <p>The judiciary department has authority to ſay, whether a law is conſtitutional or not but if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional, they cannot refuſe to execute it, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſtrong their conviction may be, that it is inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient. On this point they have no diſcretion: that lay with the legiſlature. If they ſhould aſſume this power, and have influence to ſupport it, the judiciary would ſwallow up the other departments, and the government would be diſſolved. I think the caſes preciſely ſimilar.</p>
            <p>Inſtead of a treaty, ſuppoſe an act of the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for the execution of which an appropriation is neceſſary. The ſeſſion in which this law is made expires, and a new Houſe or Repreſentatives is elected, who do not approve the law. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſends down an appropriation bill, the Houſe of Repreſentatives reject it; the law cannot be executed, it is, in fact, repealed. But, by the conſtitution, a law cannot be repealed but by the conſent of both branches of the legitlature; here then is a violation, in fact, of the conſtitution. The conſtitution requires a Preſident of the United States, and a Supreme Court; ſuppoſe either branch of the legiſlature to think thoſe or all the other officers of government unnecceſſary. How ſhall they get rid of them. They cannot alter the conſtitution; they cannot repeal the law eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the offices without the conſent of the other branch. But they can do it, in an incidental way, by refuſing an appropriation. If there be no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation, no ſalary can be drawn from the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury; if no ſalary, there will be no officers, or on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:047694_0022_10244240D1797ED8"/>the creatures of the refuſing branch; thus the refuſing branch will ſtand alone in the government, ſwallow up all power, and the government will be diſſolved. The ſame thing may be done, by making appropriations ſo inconſiderable, as to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford only ſalaries, which none but their creatures will accept.</p>
            <p>Our government may be called a government of checks; but theſe are not checks, but death and diſſolution. If a valid treaty has been made, by the Preſident and Senate, it muſt either be altered by them, with the conſent of the other nation; or the Houſe of Repreſentatives are bound by the conſtitution to make the neceſſary appropriations. If a law has been made, any branch afterwards, diſapproving it, muſt come forward directly, with a propoſal of repeal, and if not, or if they fail in repealing it, they are bound to make the neceſſary appropriations. They have no diſcretion.</p>
            <p>Though I can eaſily ſee a variety of difficulties, in any other conſtitutional diſpoſition of the power of making treaties, or in a juſt limitation of their objects; yet I confeſs, a ſtrong impreſſion, that the ſubjects of this treaty authority are not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently defined by the conſtitution; and perhaps the conſtitution may admit amendment in this reſpect. But, at preſent, it appears to me clear. And no political evil is to be more deprecated, than any one branch of the government making the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution different in practice, from what it really is. This is altering the conſtitution, at their pleaſure, and, in fact, making it a piece of blank paper. If the conſtitution is to be altered, let it be done by the whole nation in a conſtitutional way. But if uſurpations begin, they will end only with the diſſolution of our government. Doubtful uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will produce plain uſurpations; till all checks are removea, and the conſtitution proſtrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before one branch. Of all uſurpations, thoſe are moſt to be dreaded, which are made by the Houſe of Repreſentatives. That branch is numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſpread through all parts of the nation, and with the popularity and impoſing name of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

            <p>The Britiſh conſtitution has been appealed to. What is the Britiſh conſtitution? Whatever the Houſe of Commons chooſes to make it. The King is but the pageant of ſtate. The principle, that the King is not anſwerable for any of his conduct, ſhows that he has no real authority, and that the miniſter alone has all the power. In fact the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter is king. The miniſter muſt be the favourite or the maſter of the Houſe of Commons. He muſt he able either to pleaſe or to command them.—Whenever he becomies the object of their contempt, reſentment, or indifference he muſt retire from office. Neither the King, nor the Houſe of Lords, can ſhelter him from their attacks, or ſupport him in office. When a miniſter is driven out, we may ſay the King is dethroned; and every change of a miniſter, we may call a new reign. And if the King had no more influence on the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, than what he derives from the conſtitution, he would ſoon ſink under their weight, his head would be brought to the block, and his office aboliſhed; the Houſe of Lords would become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant, and ceaſe with him; and all power would be veſted in the Houſe of Commons.</p>
            <p>And we too, if we do not protect each branch of our government, in its juſt authority, will ſoon ſee them ſink under one, and it raiſed into a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular tyranny, whirled about with every ſtorm, and bearing deſtruction in its courſe.</p>
