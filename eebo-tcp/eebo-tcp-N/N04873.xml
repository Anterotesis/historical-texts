            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>MY Reverend Brother, Mr. <hi>Beach,</hi> hath ſo exhauſted the Subject in this Controverſy, and what he hath done is ſo well adapted to defend me as well as himſelf, that I ſhall give my ſelf no further Trouble than a ſhort Preface, to remark upon a few Things that may ſeem yet to demand ſomething to be ſaid in my Vindication.— And I would begin with ſaying, I am heartily ſorry for the Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our deceaſed Antagoniſt, and am particularly grieved that he ſhould be called out of the World in the Heat of this Controverſy; for (as Arch-Biſhop <hi>Tilluſon</hi> ſays, [Pref. to Serm. Joſh. xxiv. 15.] in this Caſe) <q>Methinks a Man muſt be not a little out of Countenance to find himſelf in this [diſputacious] Temper, tranſlated into the calm and peaceable Regions of the Bleſſed, &amp;c.</q>—I could wiſh he might have had Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to cool after ſo great a Part of his Life ſpent in wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling againſt the Church in one Shape or other; and that, as far as I could ever ſee, without any juſt Argument or fair Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning; not can I ſee any Thing more like fair Arguing in this laſt Piece, than in any of the former, and ſtill ſhould wonder that he could think it ſuch, if it were worth the while to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at any Thing.— I know indeed great Allowances muſt be made for human Frailty, and the unaccountable Prejudices ariſing from Temper, Cuſtom, Vogue, Education or ſome unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Aſſociation of Ideas which may ſtrangely warp our Minds and biaſs the Train of our Thoughts, though I ſhould ſcarce think it poſſible were it not frequent undeniable Fact, that any One's Mind ſhould be ſo perverted, as to be zealous to the laſt Gaſp, for Doctrines, as fundamental, which evidently appear to me directly contrary even to ſtrict Demonſtration.—But as I know I need great Allowances to be made for my ſelf, ſo I am willing to entertain the moſt candid and charitable Opinion poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of Mr. <hi>Dickinſon,</hi> and could only wiſh for the unbiaſſed Sentence of a good Judge that is perfectly diſintereſted in the Controverſy between us.—Indeed there is ſuch a Judge before
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:006094_0004_10278420A15D7160"/>whom he hath now appeared, and with whom I hope and truſt he hath obtained Forgiveneſs and Acceptance, as <hi>Job</hi>'s Friends did after their groundleſs Diſputes with him; but I can't but think it muſt have been attended with ſome ſuch a Remark upon the Cauſe he has been pleading againſt Mr. <hi>Beach</hi> as GOD makes on them. <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I was particularly grieved when I came to his laſt Words, p. 120, which he wrote in Defence of Dr. <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> two Points ſo elaborately, if he had not been ſenſible of the Deficiency of his Cauſe without them; and indeed every one that is capable of thinking and will think, muſt ſee that theſe Points are, as I ſaid, fundamental to the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pralapſarian</hi> Scheme, and that the <hi>Sublapſarian</hi> Way, which Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi> preferred, is evidently but a meer Chimera, and only keeps the Difficulty aloof and a little out of Sight, but comes to nothing without going to the Bottom of Things in the <hi>Supra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſarian</hi> Way, which being founded on thoſe Principles is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely worſe than nothing.—And whereas he pretends I diſguiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Dr's Sentiments, by inſerting an Expreſſion of my own by Way of Explication. I am content to leave the whole Iſſue with any indifferent Perſon that ſhall read the Digreſſion, and compare it with the Account I gave of it. The idle Diſtinction of <hi>abſolute</hi> and <hi>ordinate</hi> Power will nothing help it, and all

            <p>I was alſo grieved to find Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi> ſpending ſome of his laſt Hours in the ſeveral Pages before thoſe laſt mentioned, in writing over and over again what he had ſaid and I had anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered, about Neceſſity. &amp;c. I only deſire any one that would be impartial to read over again what I ſaid, and I believe he will ſee in it a ſufficient Anſwer to what he has here repeated, and I leave it to any indifferent Perſon to judge upon compa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And one would think it impoſſible he ſhould be in earneſt in pretending that my Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine led to Fataliſm, becauſe I allow GOD's Foreknowledge, which, he argues, muſt according to my Doctrine, depend on his Will, or elſe "ſome fatal Deſtiny independent on GOD or Man has counteracted his Purpoſes and produced thoſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents." P. 117.—Strange! when he knew I had maintained, as the Truth is, that they depend immediately, not on the Will of GOD, nor on Fate, but on the free Wills of wicked Men, and all that God could will was only to permit his Creatures to act freely, but this does by no Means imply, that he muſt will their Wickedneſs, it being ſolely owing to their own Wills. —As to all he ſays here of Foreknowledge, it is abundantly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by Dr. <hi>Whitby</hi> in that large Paſſage you will ſee cited by Mr. <hi>Beach.</hi> And as to his Diſtinction of Neceſſity into Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of <hi>Coertion</hi> and of <hi>Conſequence,</hi> it only ſtill confounds <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity</hi> with <hi>Certainty,</hi> which is all in Effect that the latter can mean, ſo that I cannot ſee that it at all clears the Difficulty. — Though I freely walk rather than fly, I am under as fatal a Neceſſity not to fly as I ſhould be if I was bound down under a Thouſand Weight of Lead; and ſo is the Wicked not to be good, if GOD never put it any more into his Power to be good, than to fly above the Moon or to breath at the Bottom of the Sea. —As for my Definition of <hi>Contingency</hi> which he finds Fault with, it is in Effect the ſame with Dr. <hi>Watts</hi>'s in Philoſ. Eſſays
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:006094_0006_1027842CE948B1F0"/>page. 334.—There is another Diſtinction of Neceſſity which may be of ſome Uſe in this Controverſy, i. e. into <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>moral.</hi> I am under a natural Neceſſity of weighing towards the Ground, and under a moral Neceſſity of aſſenting to ſelf evident Truth: The one is a Neceſſity of the Body, the other of the Mind, and in both I am paſſive; my Body to the Force of Gravity, and my Mind to the Force of Truth; and in my Opinion, in both Caſes to the inceſſant Exertion of the Deity himſelf, who in neither of them leaves us at Liberty. — It may indeed be figuratively ſaid, that I freely aſſent to evident Truth, as I free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffer the Force of Gravity, or the Impreſſion of Light on my Eyes, and as it is figuratively ſaid we are <hi>drawn by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and the <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>And I can prove this more directly. For whereas I had ſaid in my Sermon <q>Grace ſaves us in no other Way than by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ou obeying the Goſpel." To this Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi> reply'd, I would enquire of Mr. <hi>Beach,</hi> whether if GOD has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to ſave us by our Obedience, he is not indebted to us, to make that Promiſe good, upon our performing of that Obedience, whatever Proportion there may be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Work and the promiſed Reward? And if the Condition be Works, of whatever Value the Works be, is not the Fulfilment of the Obligation due to him who has done the Work, and perform'd the Condition?</q> Now I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to every Reader, if there can be any other Senſe put upon theſe Words fairly, but only this? That is, If GOD had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired any even the leaſt Thing to be done by us as a Condition of Salvation, then when we have done that Work and fulfilled that Condition, GOD would be obliged, and indebted to us, to ſave us; but that GOD ſhould be obliged and indebted to ſave us, is moſt abſurd to ſuppoſe: Therefore he has not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the leaſt Work to be done by us, as the Condition of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. This is the true Meaning of this Paſſage. And I am ſatisfied, he meant it in this Senſe: otherwiſe he would have tried to put ano<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And now he declares he never did deny, that GOD required ſome Thing (Work) to be done by us as a Condition of Salvation, and in ſo doing he has given up his Cauſe. For that was one principal Point for which he began the Contention. — But enough of this. Now pleaſe to read my <hi>fourth wilful falſe Citation.</hi>

               <p>I had obſerved in my sermon, that how much ſoever we magnify Grace we muſt not imagine, that "Grace will ſave us in any other Way than by our obeying the Goſpel." Or that in other Words, all the rich Grace of the Goſpel will not ſave us unleſs in Heart and Life we be conform'd to the Goſpel. I never dreamt that any but a diſtracted Man would deny this. But to my great Surprize Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi> contradicted it with the utmoſt Zeal, as overthrowing and ſubverting the whole Goſpel. What he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd againſt it I ſet in its genuine contemptible Light; for which he complains bitterly, that I have made him the Song of the Drunkard. But I appeal to all impartial Men, whether it was I, or he himſelf that made him ridiculous? But now being a little aſhamed of it, he denies that ever he ſaid it; and charges me with wilful Falſhood. Now I was ſo weak. I confeſs, as to think that when he brought ſeveral Arguments and Texts to prove that Grace don't ſave us in the Way of Goſpel Obedience, and attempted to prove that it was not only contrary to the holy Scripture, but to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and to all the Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Churches in the World, I was I ſay, ſo weak as to think, that this vehement denying that Grace does ſave us in the Way of Goſpel Obedience, was the ſame as to affirm, that Grace does not ſave us in the Way of Goſpel Obedience. Pray what do you think of it? Is it not the ſame Thing to affirm that Light is not Light, as to deny that Light is Light? Juſt ſo much Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence there is betwixt what Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi> really ſaid, and what I affirm'd, he ſaid. And pray was this a wilful Lie in me?</p>

He puts that little Word FIT in great Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals as if it were the <hi>Trojan</hi> Horſe, full of monſterous Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies ready to overſpread the Land. And now to make me ſome Amends for the great Injuries he has done me he charges me with wilful Falſhood, for nothing elſe, but putting him in Mind of it.

The Truth is, the Sermon which has occaſion'd all this Clamor and tragical Outcry, was a ſhort plain practical Diſcourſe, had nothing in it that could give the leaſt Grounds of Suſpicion; and was publiſhed with no worſer Deſign than to excite Man to Gratitude towards GOD for his free Grace, and to work out their own Salvation; from this Conſideration that the Grace of GOD would not ſave them without their own Care and Pains: And for this being furiouſly aſſaulted and ſcornfully inſulted, in Return I have weighed my Adverſary's Arguments in the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of common Senſe and found them to be wanting.— He who can't bear to be contemned, ſhould not be forward to make himſelf contemptible, and at the ſame Time to contemn others.</p>

But this I am well perſuaded of, that he did agree with me in the ſame Meaſure, and to the ſame Degree as he agreed with himſelf.

               <p>I have paſt my Trial for Lying; and hope ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted, my Enemies being Judges. I now ſtand indicted for Hereſy; and with me the Body of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> To this Indictment, I plead not guilty. And I ſhall uſe no other Evidence, than that which ray Accuſer hath brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me. For I can't wiſh for any more full in my Favour. Firſt, As to <hi>Pelagius</hi>'s own Words, GOD (ſays he) helps us— But how? By the internal Operations of his Holy Spirit? No. But <hi>by his Doctrine and Revelation.</hi> What can be more evident than that, he believed nothing of the internal Operations of the Holy Ghoſt upon our Hearts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He talks of divine Grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; but then he explains himſelf, and tells us expreſly that this divine Grace which illuminates us, and raiſes us to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of GOD, is his Doctrine and Revelation, i. e. the holy Scripture. External Grace he acknowledged; but not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal. And he that can't perceive this is not qualified to ſit Judge in ſuch weighty Trials as that of Hereſy. In this Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence there is not one Word of the Neceſſity of the internal Operation of the Spirit upon the Soul of Man: Whereas I have aſſerted and proved that the internal Operation of the Holy Ghoſt upon our Souls is as neceſſary, as the external Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Chriſt. — It is aſtoniſhing to me, that my Adverſary could imagine, that this Paſſage, diſcovered that
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:006094_0026_10278468D7069B88"/>
                  <hi>Pelagius</hi> believed the Neceſſity of the internal Operation of the Spirit, but only demed the Neceſſity of irreſiſtable Grace. I can attribute this to nothing elſe, but his being ſo exceſſively fierce and eager to prove me an Heretick, that it cauſed him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſtark blind with Charity towards <hi>Pelagius.</hi> So I knew an ill natured Man, who lived betwixt two Neighbours, with each of which he was forever quarrelling alternately; but was always careful when he was in a Fit of Railing at the one, to be exceſſive kind to the other.</p>
               <p>His other Evidence is <hi>Voſſius,</hi> who ſummed up the <hi>Pelagian</hi> Hereſy thus, <q>
                     <hi>Pelagius</hi> believed, that our Will can by its own Strength alone chuſe what Good it will: Or if it wants di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Help, (which he did not believe) yet it is at all Times equally ready and wholly in our own Power:</q> Both which Notions I oppos'd (and as I thinks with unanſwerable Reaſons in my Sermon. The Account which I gave of the <hi>Pelgian</hi> Hereſy was exactly the ſame with this of <hi>Voſſius,</hi> for I ſaid that <hi>Pelagius's</hi> Hereſy lay in this, that he believed that Man was able by his own Strength alone to convert himſelf. One Thing more I would obſerve, Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi> in tranſlating <hi>Voſſius</hi>'s Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, has omitted that Word ALONE, which while it remains, makes the Evidence as full and as ſtrong as it is poſſible in my Favour; and for what Reaſon he has been tampering with the Evidence, let the Impartial judge. I have now only improved his own Evidence. I now appeal to the Unprejudiced, let a <hi>Jew,</hi> a <hi>Turk,</hi> or <hi>Pagan,</hi> be my Judge: and give Sentence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi> and me and <hi>my Adherents,</hi> by which he means the preſent <hi>Church of England.</hi> Are we condemned Hereticks?

                  <p>Howbeit the State and Condition of Free-Will was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in our firſt Parents, before they ſinned, than it was either in them or their Poſterity after they had ſinned. For our firſt Parents <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> until they wounded and overthrew themſelves by Sin, had ſo in Poſſeſſion the ſaid Power of Free-Will by the moſt liberal Gift and Grace of GOD their Maker, that not only they might eſchew all manner of Sin, but alſo know GOD, and love him, and fulfill all Things pertaining to your Felicity and Welfare. For they were made righteous, and to the Image and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of GOD, having Power of Free Will (as <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſaith) to obey or diſobey, ſo that by Obedience they might live, and by Diſobedience they ſhould worthily deſerve to die. For the wiſe Man affirmeth of them, that the State of them was of this ſort in the Beginning, ſaying, <hi>God in the Beginning did create Man and leſt him in the Hands of his own Counſel, he gave unto him his Precepts and Commandments, ſaying, if thou wilt keep theſe Commandments, they ſhall preſerve thee; He hath ſet before thee Fire and Water, put forth thy Hand to whether thou wilt, before Man is Life and Death, Good and Evil, what him liſteth that ſhall he have.</hi> From this moſt happy Eſtate our firſt Parents falling by Diſobedience, moſt grievouſly hurted themſelves, and their Poſterity, for beſides many other Evils that came by that Tranſgreſſion, the high Power of Man's Reaſon and Freedom of Will were wounded and corrupted, and all Men thereby bro't into ſuch Blindneſs and Infirmity, that they cannot eſchew Sin except they be made free and illuminated by an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Grace, that is to ſay, by a ſupernatural Help, and working of the Holy Ghoſt, which although the Goodneſs
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:006094_0030_10278478AE340890"/>of GOD offers to all Men, yet they only enjoy it, which by their Free-Will do accept and embrace the ſame.— Nor they alſo that be holpen by the ſaid Grace can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh and perform Things that be for their Wealth, but with much Labour and Endeavour; ſo great is in our Nature the Corruption of the firſt Sin, and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Burthen bearing us down to Evil. For truly albeit the Light of Reaſon doth abide, yet it is much darkened, and with much Difficulty doth diſcern the Things that be inferior, and pertain to this preſent Life, but to underſtand and perceive the Things that be ſpiritual, and pertain to that everlaſting Life, it is of itſelf unable. And ſo likewiſe there remaineth a certain Freedom of the Will in thoſe Things which do pertain unto the Deſires and Works of this preſent Life; yet to perform ſpiritual and heavenly Things Free-Will of it ſelf is unſufficient, and therefore the Power of Man's Free Will being thus wounded and decaved hath need of a Phyſician to heal it, and one help to repair it, that it may receive Light and Strength, whereby it may be ſo, and have Power to do thoſe godly and ſpiritual Things, which before the Fall of <hi>

And hereby it appeareth, that Man's Strength and Will in all Things which be helpful to the Soul, and ſhall pleaſe GOD, hath need of the Graces of the Holy Ghoſt, by which ſuch Things <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And likewiſe as many Things be in the Scripture which do ſhew Free Will to be in Man, ſo there be no fewer Places in Scripture which declare the Grace of God to be ſo neceſſary, that if by it Free-Will be not prevented and holpen, it neither can do, nor will
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:006094_0031_1027847A3683B040"/>any Thing good and godly, of which ſort be theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures following, <hi>without me you can do nothing. No Man cometh to me except it be given him of my Father. We be not ſufficient of ourſelves, as of ourſelves to think any good Thing.</hi> According to which Scriptures, and ſuch other like if fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that Free-Will before it may will, or think any godly Thing muſt be holpen with the Grace of Chriſt, and by his Spirit be prevented and inſpired, that it may be able thereunto. And being ſo made able may from thence forth work together with Grace; and by the ſame ſuſtained, holpen and maintained, may both accompliſh good Works, and avoid Sin, and perſevere alſo, and increaſe in Grace. It is true of the Grace of God only, that firſt we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired and moved to any good Things. But to reſiſt Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and to perſiſt in Goodneſs and to go forward, it is both of the Grace of GOD and our Free Will and Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. And finally, after we have perſevered unto the End, to be crowned with Glory therefore, is the Gift and Mercy of GOD, who of his bountiful Goodneſs hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained that Reward to be given after this Life according to ſuch good Works as be done in this Life by his Grace. Therefore Men ought with much Diligence and Gratitude of Mind to conſider and regard the Inſpiration and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Motions of the Holy Ghoſt, and to embrace the Grace of GOD which is offered unto them in Chriſt, and moveth them to work good Things. And furthermore, to go about by all Means to ſhew themſelves ſuch as unto whom the Grace of GOD is not given in vain. And when they do ſettle, that notwithſtanding their Diligence, yet through their Infirmity they be not able to do that they deſire, then they ought earneſtly and with a fervent Devotion and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt Faith to ask of him which giveth the Beginning, that he would vouchſafe to perform it. Which Thing GOD will undoubtedly grant, according to his Promiſe, to ſuch as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in calling upon him. For he is naturally good, and willeth all Men to be ſaved, and careth for them, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videth all Things by which they may be ſaved, except by their own Malice they will be evil, and ſo by the righteous Judgment of GOD periſh and be loſt. For truly Men be to themſelves the Author of Sin and Damnation. GOD is neither the Author of Sin, nor the Cauſe of Damnation, and yet doth he moſt righteouſly damn thoſe
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:006094_0032_1027847E5991AB68"/>Men that do with Vices corrupt their Nature which he made good, and do abuſe the ſame to evil Deſires, againſt his moſt holy Will. Wherefore Men be to be warned that they do not impute to GOD their Vice or their Damnation, but to themſelves who by Free-Will have abuſed the Grace and Benefits of God. All Men be alſo to be admoniſhed and chiefly Preachers, that in this high Matter they look on both Sides, ſo temper and moderate themſelves, that neither they ſo preach the Grace of GOD as to take away thereby Free-Will, nor on the other Side ſo extol Free-Will, that Injuiry be done to the Grace of GOD.</p>

               <p>This Doctrine of the Concurrence of Free-Grace and Free-Will was the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> 200 Years ago, at the Dawning of the Reformation; and has ever been the ſame. Let thoſe Calumniators who are perpetually accuſing us of forſaking the firſt Doctrines of our Church, look upon this, and exert their utmoſt Skill; and I am ſure they will not be able to diſcover that we now vary from it, ſo much as one Hair's Breadth. For my Part I could not poſſibly expreſs the Sentiments of my own Soul, both with Regard to Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Sin, Free-Grace and Free-Will, more exactly than they are here expreſt. This is the Doctrine I have ever taught, and hope to hold faſt till Death. Let Men of Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi> Temper revile me as much as they pleaſe, and call me by the Names of all the deteſtable Hereticks that have ever appeared, yet this is my Proteſtation. If the Doctrines here laid down, be <hi>Pelagianiſm,</hi> if they be <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> or contrary to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> then am I a <hi>Pelagian,</hi> an <hi>Arminian</hi> and an Enemy to the Church of <hi>England;</hi> but not otherwiſe. Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi> confidently appeals to the Reader, which of us has the beſt Claim to this Article of Free-Will. Now that the Reader may eaſier and with more Diſpatch form a Judgment, I'll ſet a ſmall Specimen of Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi>'s Doctrine on the one Hand, mine on the other, and the Church's Doctrine in the middle.</p>

               <p>He ſtates it thus; <q>
                     <hi>The true Queſtion, ſays he, is whether our bleſſed Saviour, who has wrought out ſuch a ſufficient Redemption for all the World— Has not deſigned a diſtinguiſhing Application of this Redemption to ſome, in effectual Calling, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what he has deſigned for others: and whether he has not undertaken, not only to purchaſe for theſe the Privilege, that they ſhall be ſaved in caſe they believe, but alſo to purchaſe for them and before upon them the Spirit of Grace, to put within them that Principle of Faith, whereby they certainly will believe and be ſaved? — And whether the bleſſed Redeemer has under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to beſtow theſe Benefits and Privileges upon all the reſt of Mankind, in the ſame manner as upon the Elect of GOD?</hi>
                  </q> P. 51, 52. — Now to take no Notice of the Propriety and Elegance of this Language, viz. Chriſt dying for Men to beſtow upon them Privileges, and <hi>put within them a Principle of Faith;</hi> what I would obſerve is, that he aſſerts that Chriſt has wrought out a <hi>ſufficient Redemption</hi> for all the World. Now this is all I deſire: I have nothing more to contend for. I never taught univerſal Redemption in any other Senſe; or in ſtronger Terms. Only admit (as he does) that Chriſt's Redemption is ſufficient for all; and the Controverſy is at an End. For if the Redemption be ſufficient for all, then it muſt be a Purchaſe of every Thing neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on GOD's Part for the Salvation of all. Then are all put into

                  </gap>. And indeed if the Redemption of Chriſt don't contain ſo much as this, it can be neither ſufficient, nor indeed any eternal Redemption at all. In a Word, that Redemption which is not ſufficient to ſave from Hell, is none of Chriſt's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. He never did his Work by the Halves. So that Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi> has decided the Controverſy in our Favour, by ſtating the Queſtion according to his own Mind.</p>
               <p>Further I obſerve, when he ſays, <q>

                  </q> P. 53. he means that Chriſt doth not apply it to them at all. No, nor never intended to apply it to them; as he goes on to argue; <q>
                     <hi>For</hi> (ſays he) <hi>if he had undertaken for all the World that they ſhould come to him—he would certainly accompliſh his Undertaking—they would all be ſanctified here, and glorified hereafter.</hi>
                  </q> P. 53. You ſee then that he aſſerts that theſe Reprobates Chriſt never intended apply his Redemption to them. And is it poſſible then for them ever to be the better for it? They can't apply it to themſelves, and Chriſt never intended to apply it to them; he ſays, and thinks he proves.</p>

I demand, when they ſay, Chriſt died for all, ſo far as to procure Pardon and Salvation for them if they will believe and repent, whether he did procure Pardon and Salvation on a Condition which it was poſſible upon that Aſſiſtance which he would vouchſafe them, to perform? Or only upon a Condition which to them was impoſſible, for want of Grace ſufficient for them to perform?—If the latter only, it is
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:006094_0037_1027848F56829A90"/>certain that he died not at all them; for what is only done upon an impoſſible Suppoſition, is not done at all. It being the ſame Thing not to die at all for their Benefit, as to do it only on a Condition they cannot poſſibly perform. But if he died to procure Pardon and Salvation for them, on a Condition, which by that Grace, which he was ready to vouchſafe to them, as well as to the Elect, they might be able to perform, then he died intentionally, and on his Part effectually, to procure Pardon and Salvation to them, as well as to the Elect, and ſo all Mankind may be ſaved, and them Chriſt muſt have died for the Salvation of them all.</q>

               <p>I obſerve then in the firſt Place, theſe Queſtions are founded upon one poor Fallacy and miſerable Miſtake, that is, that the Application of Chriſt's Redemption to our Souls is ſo entirely the Work of GOD, as that it don't at all depend upon the Free-Will of Man, whether it ſhall be effectual to us, or not. This I ſay is a meer Fallacy and poor begging the Queſtion. For though Chriſt has fully redeemed every one of us, and ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tenders and applies this Salvation to us, both outwardly by his Word, and inwardly by his Spirit: yet may we either em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, or reject the offer'd Salvation. And as we do either, ſo are we happy or miſerable. Chriſt has done his Part both he purchaſing and in applying his Salvation to Millions who are never actually ſaved, becauſe they practically counted themſelves unworthy of eternal Life. In the Application of Chriſt's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, Man's wicked Will to periſh often prevails againſt Chriſt's ſincere Will of their Salvation. This is plain Scripture Matth. 23.37.

Then GOD is not willing that Men ſhould obey him, when they diſobey; then GOD is not willing any more ſhould repent and be ſaved than are eventually ſaved; then GOD's Will is as truly done while Men ſin, as when they repent. And can any Man be ſo unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as to believe it? Thus having cleared the Way, I will give a full and plain Anſwer to that cloſe Queſtion, <hi>viz.

               <p>But then if by this trying Queſtion you mean, was it Chriſt's original Deſign and Will that more Men ſhould have his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption effectually applied to them and enjoy'd by them, than do eventually enjoy it?

As to Chriſt's failing of Succeſs, it is unqueſtionable Fact, that GOD's Methods to reclaim Men often fail of the Succeſs he deſires, through Men's Perverſeneſs, even when GOD can truly ſay, what could have been done more for them than I have done.

               <p>No Sir, here you are a little miſtaken, this Concluſion don't follow from my Principle: becauſe GOD's drawing is not irreſiſtable, or an Act of Almighty Power upon the Soul which cannot be reſiſted. GOD has drawn Millions, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were actually drawn ſo as to come to Chriſt. So GOD drew the whole Body of the Jewiſh Nation, and yet they never were actually drawn to him, but forſook him the Fountain of living Waters, Jer. xxxi. 3. <hi>With Loving-Kindneſs have I drawn thee.</hi> Hoſ. xi. 4. <hi>I drew them with the Cords of a Man.</hi> This is ſpoken of all his profeſſing People in general, every one of them had GOD's Drawings, and yet Thouſands of them were never the nearer to GOD for that. So that is often given from above to Men which yet becauſe they don't accept and improve it, they are nothing the better for it— See here the Marrow of this Gentleman's Divinity ſo far as concerns his Diſpute with me. He ſeems to think, that when any Man is wicked it is becauſe GOD don't give him Grace to become good. For why (argues he) are not all Men gracious and ſaved if GOD be willing to give them Grace! Juſt as if nothing could prevent their being holy and happy, if GOD were but willing that they ſhould be ſo.—You may call it inveighing, or what you pleaſe, but I muſt confeſs I am aſtoniſhed to ſee that your eminent Teachers have no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Chriſt's Death is to be conſider'd in a twofold Reſpect. <hi>1ſt,</hi> As to the Will of GOD in ſending his Son, and that was that he ſhould die for the World, and the Deſign of the Son which was to give himſelf a Ranſom for all, and with Regard to the Virtue and Power of his Death, in theſe three Reſpects Chriſt died for every Man. But then, <hi>2dly,</hi> If you conſider the Event of Chriſt's Death ariſing from the different Behaviour of Mankind, ſome believing in him and ſome rejecting him and turning Enemies to his Croſs; and thereupon the Fathers's and the Son's ſubſequent Will which was that none ſhould enjoy the Fruit of Chriſt's Death to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but thoſe who comply with the End of his Death, repent and obey him: In this Senſe Chriſt died only for Believers, only for his Sheep, only for his Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> he never intended or deſigned that any ſhould be ſaved by his Death, who don't comply with the Terms of that Salvation that his Death has purchaſed. This Diſtinction well attended to, all the Miſt which he has rais'd in both his Books vaniſhes away in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>And though he is pleaſed to ſay, that I took no Notice of this Argument, yet it is ſo far from being true, that I did in Fact anſwer it, and he has taken no Notice of my Anſwer, which was in theſe Words, Pag. 41. <q>
                     <hi>Have not I choſen you Twelve, and one of you is a Devil? Judas</hi> was as much choſen, yea and given to Chriſt of the Father, as the reſt.</q> Joh. xvii. 12. <hi>Thoſe that thou gaveſt me have I kept, and none of them is loſt but the Son of Perdition.</hi> It is from hence evident, that being choſen and given of the Father, don't denote an abſolute Decree of their Salvation. And it is indeed aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he ſhould quote this Expreſſion of the Father's <hi>giving them to Chriſt,</hi> to prove his abſolute Doctrine, and take no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of <hi>Judas</hi> being loſt who had been given to him, which at once utterly demoliſhes his Scheme.</p>

This I think, I did not deny in my Sermon; but only ſeemed to doubt of it; for which Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi> ſaw fit to correct me.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>But Mr.</hi> Dickinſon <hi>ſeems to think the Queſtion, is, Whether the Words Election and Elect never imply any more in the New-Teſtament, than merely enjoying the Privileges of the Goſpel.</hi> Page 61.</p>

               <p>He choſe ſo to ſtate the Queſtion, becauſe this would give him ſome Room for diſputing. But when in his Remarks, he fixed a wrong Senſe upon one of my Expreſſions I don't ſay wilfully I explain'd my ſelf fully in my Reply, in theſe Words, <q>The Point I am to prove is this, though the Words Elect and Choſen, Election and Choice, to Elect and Chuſe are uſed in ſeveral different Senſes in the holy Bible, and ſome Times the Elect denotes faithful Chriſtians, yet never do any of theſe Words imply an eternal abſolute Predeſtination to Happineſs without Regard to Faith and Obedience: Neither is there any ſuch Doctrine taught in the holy Scripture.</q> P. 39. To this he replies, P. 62. <hi>It this not at all affect the Merits of the Cauſe, to enquire into the different Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſes in which the Words Elect and Choſen, Election and Choice, to Elect and Chuſe are uſed in the holy Bible.</hi>—This is ſtrange indeed! What is it no Matter what theſe Words ſignify and mean in the holy Bible! I thought all the Controverſy was about the Meaning of theſe Words, as they ſtand in the Scripture. If I can but find out what the Holy Ghoſt means, by ſuch Words, I care not what this or that Sect mean by Election. But there was more Subtilty in this, than a curſory Reader would think of. For by not regarding that the Scripture uſes the Word Election in ſeveral different Senſes, and that I endeavour'd to uſe it in the ſame Manner that the Holy Ghoſt teaches, by this Piece of reſolved Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, he has gain'd ſeveral Triumphs, though indeed it is over Nobody. I will give you but one Inſtance of it. P. 63. He ſays to me, <hi>You tell us that all whom GOD, foreknew, he foreſaw would he Chriſt's faithful Followers, if ſo them all profeſſing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians do not belong to the Election of Grace, for all profeſſing
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:006094_0043_102784A284B0AB18"/>Chriſtians are not Chriſt's faithful Followers. And therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your own Interpretation this Text utterly ſubverts your Scheme:</hi> When in that very Paragraph I had told him that the Predeſtinate did not ſignify there meet Profeſſors of Chriſtianity. Is not this now infinitely pretty! Has be not cut me down, and demoliſhed my Scheme with one Stroke; and all by reſolving not to regard what I ſay, nor what I mean.</p>
               <p>I have read a few Diſputes in the Courſe of my Life, but I never ſaw any Thing like this. I don't mean, that this is the weakeſt, no, it is crafty enough: but I am at a loſs to find where the Honeſty of it lies. I proved by ſundry Texts that the Word Elect and Election did not denote an abſolute Decree to ſave this or that Man, but often it means all Chriſtians in general, and ſometimes ſincerely good Men. I let him know that I owned GOD's eternal Decree to ſave all thoſe whom he foreſaw would perſevere in Faith till Death; ſo that his Work lay fair before him, which was to prove an eternal Election without a Foreſight of Faith and good Works. At this my Friend was ſenſible, he could make but a mean Figure: But an Anſwer he muſt write in ſome Shape or other. He there upon concludes upon this Device, <hi>viz.</hi> to make his Reader be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that my Opinion is, that the Word <hi>Predeſtination</hi> in the 17th Article, the Words <hi>Predeſtinate, Elect</hi> and <hi>Election</hi> in holy Scripture never mean or import more than meet Profeſſors of Chriſtianity: Such a Whim as never entered my Heart. And altho' when I perceived him beginning to play at this Game in his firſt Book, I entered my Proteſt againſt this unfair Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and told him I underſtood the 17th Article, as meaning an eternal Decree, but not an abſolute and unconditional one, and in the ſame Senſe I underſtood ſeveral Texts in the holy Bible. But all that I could ſay, avail'd nothing, he was reſolved to miſunderſtand, and miſrepreſent me; and by virtue of this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Reſolution, he has made ſad and <hi>Mongrel</hi> Work of it, as he calls it; but has not anſwered one Argument that I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, not done any Thing like it.</p>

                     <hi>Was the moſt atrocious Wickedneſs, that ever was committed, what GOD's Hand and Counſel had determined before? And may'nt the ſame be ſaid of other Events likewiſe? Is it true,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that what GOD did before by his Counſel
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:006094_0044_102784A42CC22528"/>determine, he wills and was pleaſed with?

                        </gap>w him. For this is what GOD did by his Counſel determine before to be done. Now Sir, anſwer this conſiſtently if you can.</hi>

               <p>Sir I chearfully accept the Challenge, to vindicate the moral Character of our infinitely good GOD, from ſuch horrid Suggeſtions as though he decreed, will'd, and was pleaſed with all the wicked Deeds done by Men and Devils. Now then when it is ſaid, Acts 2.23. <hi>Him, being delivered by the determinate Council and Fore-knowledge of GOD, ye have taken, and with wicked Hands have crucified and ſlain.</hi> And Acts 4.27, 28. <hi>For of a Truth againſt thy holy Child Jeſus, whom thou haſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed, both</hi> Herod <hi>and</hi> Pontius Pilate, <hi>with the Gentiles, and the People of</hi> Iſrael <hi>were gathered together for to do whatſoever thy Hand and thy Counſel determined before to he done.</hi> Theſe Words don't denote, that GOD decreed, will'd, or was pleaſed with <hi>Judas</hi> his being ſo convetous as to betray Chriſt; the Jews be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo malicious as to proſecute him; or <hi>Herod</hi>'s being ſo inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and profane as to ſet him at nought, or <hi>Pilate</hi>'s being ſo unjuſt as to condemn him; none of all theſe wicked Humours and Deeds were decreed, will'd by, or pleaſing to GOD, who infinitely hates, and therefore can't decree a wicked Deed: But all Things being eternally preſent to his infinite Mind, and he foreſeeing that <hi>Judas</hi> would be ſo convetous as to betray Chriſt, if he had an Opportunity, and that the Jews would be envious and ſpiteful enough to murder him, and <hi>Pilate</hi> would be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt as to condemn the Innocent; what his Counſel determined was, that Chriſt ſhould come into their Hands, and be left in their Power, when he knew they would crucify him. Thus GOD without decreeing the leaſt wicked Deed by his infinite Knowledge and Wiſdom has brought the greateſt Good out of the greateſt Wickedneſs, only foreſeen, not decreed. In a Word, GOD foreſees wicked Deeds, and decrees to over-rule them ſo as to bring Good out of them, but he does not decree them. Thus, I think, I have in full, though in ſhort, anſwered Mr. Preſident's Challenge, and vindicated our heavenly Father from the horrid Suſpicion of his being the Decreer or Willer of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Deeds.</p>
               <p>And now let me tell you, as a Friend, that I can't but think it extremely improper, (to ſay no worſe of it,) to teach young

That which is not, and has no Being cannot be made ſure in any Senſe. It is therefore
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:006094_0046_102784AC26377A50"/>evident, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> thought, they had every one of them an Election, and all were elected in his Senſe, and as he uſed the Word, for it is abſurd to exhort to make that ſure, that we ſuppoſe, has no Exiſtence, neither is, nor ever can be. Beſides, I obſerved, that GOD only could make his Decree ſure or firm, and therefore we muſt not think that the Apoſtle would exhort them to make it ſure, which was the Work of GOD alone. To this Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi> replies, <hi>But is it not poſſible to make it ſure to ourſelves?</hi> P. 32. To which I anſwered, <q>By <hi>making it ſure to our ſelves,</hi> you mean, to make it manifeſt, evident and clear to our ſelves; but the Word in the Original tranſlated <hi>ſure,</hi> has no ſuch Meaning, but always ſignifies, firm, effectual and ſtedfaſt, and ſo cannot bear the Senſe you put upon it, ſo it is uſed Heb. 2.2 <hi>If the Word ſpoken by Angels was ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt.</hi>
                  </q> —P. 44. Thus far we proceeded. And now I don't find that Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi> has taken the leaſt Notice of this, and many other Arguments which I thought, came very cloſe to the Point in Diſpute. Now if I am in an Error, I ſhould have been exceeding thankful, if he would have ſet me right: But alas he has left me juſt as he found me, only a little more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd in my old Notion, that according to the Language of the Holy Ghoſt all the Chriſtians in the World are elected: They have all a Calling and an Election which by Diligence they may make ſure of, or by Negligence may looſe.</p>

This is not the only Point in which he has betray'd his Cauſe. I think he has abandon'd it under every Head.

Thus if you tell a Beggar only reach hither thine Hand and take it, and I will beſtow upon thee a Thouſand Pounds; if the poor Man does but make that Motion, and comply with that Condition, and reach forth his Hand, only that ſingle Motion alters the Nature of the Thouſand Pounds, ſo that it is no longer Bounty or a Gift; but is become Wages due to an Hireling for his Works, and is the Effect of his Merit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So that the Beggar may boaſt and ſay, I have merited this Thouſand Pounds of you, it is the Reward of my <hi>Hire,</hi> I have earned it of you by my Works.

               <p>Yes, this is the Privilege of every Chriſtian, that they are kept by the Power of GOD in the Senſe in which St. <hi>Peter</hi> meant it. Not that GOD's Power is engaged to carry them to Heaven in Spite of all their own Oppoſition; or let them be ever ſo wicked, but GOD's Power is ſo engaged to bring them to Heaven, that neither Men nor Devils ſhall keep them out of it, if they don't wilfully leave the Way that leads to Heaven, and obſtinately chuſe the broad Road to Deſtruction. And this is as much as a reaſonable Creature can deſire, while he is in a State of Probation.</p>

               <p>Yes, this all Chriſtians profeſs to do, and he ſpeaks of them according to their Profeſſion. As it may be truly ſaid of Mankind, they are rational Creatures, this Character is juſtly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to Men in general, and yet ſad Experience teaches, that a great many Men are very unreaſonable. So what St. <hi>Peter</hi> here ſays, is the true Character of Chriſtians in general, as they ſtood diſtinguiſhed from the unbelieving World, though (to our Shame) it muſt be own'd, we don't all live up to our Character and holy Profeſſion.</p>

               <p>This, and many other Texts are a full Proof of what I pretend to in my Sermon. And they ſignify no more than this, that GOD had of his infinite Mercy from the Beginning de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to call the Gentiles, into his Vineyard, the Church, and to invite them to the Goſpel-Feaſt; that they mighty enjoy the gracious Offer of eternal Life; which eternal Life they ſhould obtain, provided they heartily believed in Jeſus Chriſt, when he
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:006094_0050_102784BA974C37D8"/>was preached to them, and gave themſelves up to be guided and ſanctified by the Holy Spirit.— There is not the leaſt Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in all theſe Texts of an abſolute Election of particular Perſons to Salvation.—Who can be ſo unreaſonable, as to think that the Apoſtles would write Epiſtles to whole Churches, in which there were many Thouſands whom they had never ſeen, and tell them plumply one and all, that they were elected in a perſonal and <hi>Calviniſtie</hi> Senſe; and that they knew this for Truth, as 1 Theſſ. i. 24. <hi>To the Church of the</hi> Theſſalonians — <hi>knowing your Election of GOD.</hi> Let who will believe this to be the Deſign of the holy Pen-Men, I ſhall not believe it, till I can ſee more Reaſon for it than Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi> has offer'd Did ever a Calviniſt write a Letter to all the Chriſtians of a whole Country, nay many Countries together, and tell them they, and he knew for certain, they were all perſonally and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely elected?</p>

                  <hi>Now tell me, did you return that Anſwer, to ſuch a Diſcourſe as Mr.</hi> Dickinſon <hi>ſays, you did?</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>No, indeed I did not. If I had taken ſuch a Liberty with him, as he has done with me, I ſhould have had very little Reaſon to complain, if he had called me by an ill Name, which I don't deſire to mention. But the worſt I ſhall ſay is this, he has miſtook the whole Affair. I as firmly believe all this as he did, <hi>viz.</hi> That Mankind are degenerate, and that we are naturally ſtrongly inclined to Sin— And therefore I needed not that impertinent Multiplicity of Words, either to inform or convince me.</p>
               <p>What I called a Fable, was the Account that he gave, of GOD's entering into Covenant with <hi>Adam,</hi> which as far as I could underſtand him was to this Purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That it <hi>Adam</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="unknown:006094_0051_102A78CD405AD5E8"/>would forbear to eat of the forbidden Fruit for a Day, or a Week, or Month, or a Year, I could not learn from him how long exactly the Trial was to laſt, but he intimated, it was to be hat a very ſhort Term, and then all Danger, all Trial and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation for <hi>Adam,</hi> and his numerous Iſſue was to be over, and none of them was to be put to the Trouble of a perſonal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. This he ſuppos'd was unſpeakably better than to be Probationers ourſelves. And who would not rather chuſe this Method, and leave all in the Hands of <hi>Adam,</hi> than be for ever upon Probation, in one's own Perſon? this I did then and do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ill call a <hi>Fable,</hi> it has not only no Foundation in the Word of GOD, but is there plainly contradicted; as I have proved in another Place. Beſides it is in many Reſpects a moſt abſurd Scheme. To name but one. This Hypotheſis makes <hi>Adam</hi>'s Righteouſneſs infinitely more valuable and efficacious than that of Chriſt's the <hi>Lord from Heaven:</hi> For according to Mr. <hi>Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinſon,</hi> if <hi>Adam</hi> had kept but one Precept, and that for a ſhort Time, that Obedience would have been of ſuch infinite Virtue, as to ſecure eternal Happineſs to himſelf and to every ſingle Child of his for ever. Whereas Chriſt's moſt holy Life and dreadful Death could ſave but a Part of Mankind: Neither could it ſave one of them, but upon Condition of their own Faith and ſincere Repentance, whereas <hi>Adam</hi>'s Righteouſneſs was of ſuch Virtue as to ſave all, abſolutely and unconditionally: Such Whims, I confeſs, I don't believe. And I wonder, how thoſe Divines who pretend to make the Scripture the Rule of their Faith can give Heed to ſuch Fables.</p>
               <p>The Occaſion to ſpeak of Original Sin which Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi> catched at in my Sermon was this, I ſaid, that it is not a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Vindication that ſuch Men make of GOD's Mercy towards the Souls of Men, to ſay as they do, that GOD leaves them without ſufficient Help, under a Neceſſity of being wicked and miſerable for ever, becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> loſt their Power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and repent—And this I am perſuaded is moſt true and very conſiſtent with the Church of <hi>England</hi> Doctrine of Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin. That GOD ſhould command us to do, what we cannot do without his Grace and puniſh us eternally for not doing it, while he was not pleaſed to give us neceſſary Help; this, I ſay, is to charge our heavenly Father with Cruelty, and therefore GOD forbid that I ſhould do it. They are miſtaken, when they ſay we loſt our Power in <hi>Adam,</hi> and that GOD may juſtly damn us for not repenting and not making
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:006094_0052_102784BC27A6B220"/>ourſelves a new Heart, tho' he does not now give us Power to repent, becauſe he once have us that Power, and <hi>Adam</hi> loſt it for us. For as Dr. <hi>Whitby</hi> obſerves, <q>
                     <hi>Adam,</hi> when he was firſt created had no ſuch Ability that in caſe he ſhould fall he could riſe again by Frith and Repentance.—Therefore, we never loſt any ſuch Power in him. But ſuppoſing we loſt the Gift of Faith and Repentance in <hi>Adam,</hi> which is certainly falſe, yet you muſt remember, the Goſpel is a gracious Tender of Pardon to ſallen Creatures: Now to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe Pardon to a lapſed Perſon upon a Condition, is in Effect for GOD to ſay, he will not impute to him his former Fault, but will deal with him according to his future Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, to which a conditional Promiſe always has a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; but if he ſtill requires what he knows the firſt Fault hath render'd utterly impoſſible to be done by him he ſtill imputes that Fault, and puniſhes him at the ſame Time for it as he pretendeth to remit it; and ſurely it is no ſmall Matter to render GOD ſo deluſory and deceitful, ſo inſincere and hypocritical, as this Opinion makes him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Should a Phyſician come to a Patient whoſe Stomach was ſo weaken'd through his Intemperance and Luſt, that it could bear no ſtrong Meat, and his Feet ſo enfeebled that he could ſcarce walk from his Couch to his Bed ſide, and profeſs an earneſt Deſire to cure his Diſtemper, and promiſe him Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, provided he would follow his Preſcriptions, might it not reaſonably be expected he ſhould preſcribe ſuch Means for his Recovery, that it was poſſible for him in this Condition to make Uſe of? If then he ſhould enjoin him to eat and to digeſt the ſtrongeſt Meats, and walk ſome Hours in the Fields, becauſe he formerly could do ſo, before he fell into this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability and Feebleneſs; would not all Men pronounce him a deluding Cheat, and one that hypocritically and inſincerely pretended his Recovery, and promiſed it with equal Vanity and Folly, intending only to inſult over his preſent Miſery; And yet this is the Repreſentation of our gracious GOD, in this Affair which theſe Men offer to us. For the bleſſed Jeſus is the Phyſician which GOD ſent to heal our Natures of the Diſability which we had contracted by the Fall, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe us a Remedy, which if we would uſe, we ſhould reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that or a better Life than that from which we fell, and to threaten the ſevereſt Judgments if we neglect ſo to do.
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:006094_0053_102784C38C942B48"/>But then, if he only doth promiſe this Recovery on ſuch a Condition as that very Fall hath render'd us unable to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and which he never will enable us to perform, muſt he not be guilty of the like Hypocriſy and Inſincerity in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding to us an impoſſible Remedy, and inſult only over the Miſery of his Creatures whilſt he pretends Kindneſs to them? And how unreaſonable is it to impute ſuch Deceit, Falſhood, Inſincerity and Injuſtice to a good and righteous GOD, which we cannot but abhor in Man? For ſure, moſt graciouſly to exhort, moſt affectionately to invite, moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly by the greateſt Promiſes and Threats to move us to repent and believe, when at the ſame Time he is moſt firmly purpoſed to withhold the Means, by which alone we can do either, is to inſult over his miſerable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the higheſt Manner: And to deal thus with Myriads for the Sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> is, as it were, to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Revenge upon the greateſt Part of his Poſterity to the World's End for what was only done by the firſt Man: yet, it is to do this under Pretence of Love and kind Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and a vehement Deſire and Concern that they ſhould eſcape the Miſery that very Sin had brought upon them, and recover the Felicity they had loſt by it, by thoſe very Means he doth preſcribe; And yet to leave them under an utter Incapacity to perform thoſe Means: Which to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and aſſert of our moſt gracious GOD, is highly to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour and blaſpheme his ſacred Majeſty, and repreſent him ſo unto the World, as even the worſt of Men would not endure to be ſo repreſented.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we are entered upon that Inquiry, whether GOD does afford the internal Aſſiſtance of his Spirit in ſuch a Meaſure to all under the Goſpel as to put them under a Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of obtaining Salvation? this I affirm, and he denies.</p>

               <p>Now the Chriſtians at <hi>Corinth</hi> had a fooliſh Contention
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:006094_0054_102784CA4FA34008"/>about ſeveral Teachers who had been among them, they grew hot and ran into Parties and Factions, ſome preferring one Teacher and ſome another; to convince them of the Unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of this Practice, the Apoſtle ſays to them, <hi>who maketh thee to differ from another?</hi> That is, it GOD only, who in his Providence gives one Man a better Teacher than another; and therefore none of you have any Reaſon to be puffed up againſt, or deſpiſe another, altho' you have a better Teacher than he hath. The Apoſtle don't ſay, that GOD alone makes one Teacher to differ from another; for different Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will make ſome Difference among Teachers, but he ſays, <hi>Who maketh thee</hi> (i. e. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Now though GOD did make one Teacher to differ from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by miraculous Gifts (in thoſe Days common) in receiving of which they were meerly paſſive; yet this is nothing at all to the Caſe in Hand. And it is a monſtrous Error to ſay, that GOD alone makes all the Difference among Mankind; and, that no Part is owing to Men's different Conduct and Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. When of two Men the one is temperate, and the other a Drunkard, the one a righteous Dealer, and the other a Thief or Pirate, it is not GOD who makes all the Difference, for then the Vicious would be as worthy of Praiſe and Reward as the Virtuous. GOD, its true, makes a Difference among Mankind, by giving different Talents, but then Experience ſhews, that Men having equal Talents, may differ from each other by their different Improvements of the ſame Talents.</p>

                  </gap>teries of it which were neceſſary to be believed, from the Wiſe and Prudent, the Effect of which Hiding muſt unavoidably by their eternal Damnation; this is ſurprizing! this is amazing! In this Senſe Mr. <hi>Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinſon</hi> plainly underſtands it, or elſe when he ſo often cites it, he does it impertinently. Here then let us enquire, 1. Who are the Wiſe and Prudent, and who are the Babes? 2. What is meant by GOD's hiding the Myſteries of Chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity from the Wiſe and Prudent? 3. What was the true Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt's rejoicing and giving Thanks? To begin with the <hi>Firſt,</hi> by the Wiſe and Prudent are meant the Doctors of the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Rulers of the Nation: Theſe were the moſt obſtinate Enemies to Chriſt, and deaf to all the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that could be offer'd in Defence of his divine Miſſion. Hence they ſaid, <hi>Have any of the Rulers or Phariſees believed on him?</hi> John vii. 46. Now theſe Men are called wiſe and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, not becauſe they were really ſo, but becauſe they vainly eſteemed themſelves wiſe and prudent; and were generally ſo accounted. But had they been wiſe and prudent indeed, they would have honeſtly enquired into Chriſt's Pretenſions, and have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently examin'd the Teſtimonials he bro't with him from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and ſo would have been convinc'd of his being the Chriſt.— And by Babes are meant the ignorant and unlearn'd common People, ſometimes ſtiled the Poor, who had the Goſpel preach'd to them. Now the common People among the <hi>Jews</hi> were like Babes or Children, in that they were more free from Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, more humble and teachable, than their wiſe Men; and ſo were better prepared to be wrought upon by Chriſt's Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and better diſpoſed to receive the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>The common People here called Babes, were in Chriſt's Time ſo well diſpos'd towards Chriſtianity, that had their Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Rulers let them alone, and not violently oppos'd it, they would have readily believed in Chriſt, ſo mightily were they affected with his aſtoniſhing Works and heavenly Doctrine. But the proud and obſtinate Wretches conceiting themſelves wiſe and prudent, would neither go into Chriſt's Kingdom them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor by their Good-Will ſuffer the common People to go in. And it was eaſier to reveal the Goſpel to <hi>Babes,</hi> i. e. the humble ignorant <hi>Vulgar,</hi> than to convince them of its Truth. And now for the Second Enquiry, that is, in what Senſe did

But for GOD to do any Thing on Purpoſe to hide his Truth from Men, and lead them into damning Miſtakes, this is far, very far from being agreeable to what St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſays, 2 Pet. iii. 9. <hi>The Lord is not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to Repentance.</hi> Thus then <hi>Secondly,</hi> Though GOD does nothing which can lay Men under a Neceſſity not to ſee the Things of their eternal Peace, yet it is certain, that no Men will ſee them, but only ſuch as love the Truth; or though GOD does nothing to <hi>hide</hi> the Goſpel from Men, yet no Men will ſee ſo much of its Excellency as to embrace it ſincerely, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they are willing to know and do the Will of GOD. Our bleſſed Saviour was wont often to ſay, <hi>He that hath Ears to hear, let him hear,</hi> which denotes that though all Men have na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Capacities ſufficient to receive all neceſſary Truth, yet there were many who were ſo full of Prejudices and Self Will, that they had no Ears to hear, that is, they had no Inclination towards the Truth: They hated it becauſe it croſs'd their Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and former Notions, ſo that their Want of Ears to hear and Eyes to ſee, was not becauſe GOD never gave theſe to them, but becauſe they would not uſe them: But when they had Ears they were like the deaf Adder who ſtoppeth her Ear: ſo they ſtop their Ears and will not hear the Voice of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, let him reaſon ever ſo wiſely, their Deafneſs and Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the Effect of their own Perverſeneſs, juſt thus it was with

               <p>I anſwer, according to the Language of the holy Bible, oftentimes GOD is ſaid, to do ſuch Things, which he neither decreed, nor willed, nor in any Degree effected by his Power; but only ſuffered it, to come to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>it to permit it, not one Sparrow fails, nor an Hair of our Head falls to the Ground, without the Notice of our heavenly Father, no Event can befall us though ever ſo caſual, or ever ſo much Chance-medly, but what GOD foreſees and permits; ſeeing therefore GOD ſuperintends all Events either ordering, or permitting and over-ruling them for Good, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in a figurative Way ſuch Things are often aſcrib'd to GOD which he neither willed nor effected, but only ſuffered to be done when he could by his infinite Power have hinder'd them: As Prov. xvi. 4. <hi>The Lord hath made all Things for himſelf;</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Or <hi>to anſwer one another,</hi> as it might be rendered more agreeable to the Hebrew.</note> 
                  <hi>yea even the wicked for the Day of Evil.</hi> Which certainly does not mean, that GOD makes Men wicked: But they make themſelves wicked, and the Lord ſo orders all Events, as that they ſhall moſt certainly come into the <hi>Day of Evil,</hi> that is, the Day of Puniſhment.</p>
               <p>Again, It is ſaid 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> xxiv. 1. The Lord moved <hi>David</hi> to number the People. Now it is evident from other Texts, that
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:006094_0059_102784D79E9E3DD8"/>all which GOD did, was to permit <hi>Satan</hi> and his own Vanity to move him to do it. So when it is ſaid in this Text, that GOD <hi>hid</hi> the Goſpel from theſe Men it don't mean, that GOD had not given them Grace ſufficient to enable them to ſee the Things of their eternal Peace, or that he had leſt them under an abſolute Incapacity to be convinced of the Truth of the Goſpel and to believe in Chriſt; for then they would not have been at all to blame for not ſeeing, and not believing: for who can blame a blind Man becauſe he don't ſee, or a deaf Man becauſe he can't hear, when GOD has not given them Power to do it? And yet Chriſt often reproved and upbraided theſe Men for their Unbelief and Hardneſs of Heart; which he would never have done if he had ſuppoſed, as Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi> did, that GOD never had given them Sufficiency of his Grace to enable them to ſee and believe; or that GOD had never put it in their Power to receive him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We come now to the laſt Enquiry. What was the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt's Rejoicing and giving Thanks; was it becauſe the Goſpel was hid from the Wiſe and Prudent, or was it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was <hi>reveal'd to Babes?</hi> Or did he rejoice in and give Thanks for both? I anſwer; No, it was not for both: It was only becauſe the Goſpel was revealed to Babes, that Chriſt rejoiced and gave Thanks. Men's Blindneſs, Unbelief and Damnation are no Occaſion of Joy to any but the curſed Fiends of Hell, and thoſe who are like them: And it is horrid Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy to ſuppoſe that our Saviour was guilty of ſo much Ill-Nature, as to give Thanks, and rejoice when he obſerved that Men were going blindly to Hell; and the Goſpel's being HID from ſome, is here put in Oppoſition to its being REVEALED to others, only that the former may illuſtrate the latter, as black ſet oppoſite to white, makes the latter appear the whiter; this is a common Thing in the Scripture. But I'll only repeat that Parallel Text I gave to Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi> before, but he was too wiſe and prudent, to learn from me, Rom. vi. 17. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays thus, <hi>GOD be thanked, that ye were the Servants of Sin, but ye have obeyed from the Heart that Form of Doctrine,</hi> &amp;c.— Now you may as well argue from this, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> was thankful that theſe Men had ſpent all the former Part of their Life in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude of Sin, as Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi> does from this Text that Chriſt was not willing to die effectually on his Part for <hi>ſome,</hi> nor had GOD elected theſe <hi>(Some)</hi> nor was he willing to give ſufficient Grace to theſe <hi>(Some)</hi> becauſe Chriſt thanked his heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:006094_0060_102784DCB00D4500"/>for HIDING the Benefits of his Redemption from <hi>Some,</hi> when in Truth Chriſt never did thank GOD for any ſuch <hi>Thing,</hi> but it was his unhappy Miſtake which he too long perſiſted in. I have been the longer upon this Text, hoping I may contribute ſomething, to prevent its being ſo horribly abuſed for the future (which GOD grant) I muſt be ſhorter upon what follows.</p>

                  <q>Now, ſays he, that theſe Words do not imply that GOD is the ſole Agent in Converſion, is plain from hence, that we are exhorted in the Verſe immediately preceeding <hi>to work out our Salvation with Fear and Trembling;</hi> and it is brought as a Reaſon why we ought to do this, becauſe it is <hi>GOD that works in us both to will and to do.</hi> Now it would be very ſtrange, that GOD ſhould uſe that for a Reaſon to us why we ſhould work out our own Salvation, which is on the other Hand a clear Reaſon why we <hi>need not.</hi> And yet this is the very Caſe if GOD's working in us be ſuppos'd to imply that he is the ſole Cauſe of Converſion. For if GOD be the <hi>ſole</hi> Cauſe of Converſion, if he does all, then there is nothing left for us to do; and then to what Purpoſe is it that we ſhould work? If GOD worketh not, our working will not profit us, and if he doth work, our Negligence, nay our utmoſt Reſiſtance, cannot hurt us; for this Work of GOD is ſuppos'd to be irreſiſtable, and conſequently uncapable of being fruſtrated by the ſtouteſt Oppoſition we are able to make againſt it. This Conſideration therefore that <hi>GOD worketh in us,</hi> can (upon this Suppoſition) be no Argument why a Man ſhould himſelf work; but a plain Argument to the contrary; and therefore the Apoſtle would never have uſed it, much leſs would he have added with Fear and Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling; for there can be no Cauſe of Fear and Trembling if we cannot miſcarry through our own Negligence, which if GOD be the ſole Cauſe of Converſion, we certainly cannot. But it will be enough to expoſe this Notion, nakedly to ſet down the Apoſtle's Diſcourſe, as it muſt run according to this Interpretation. Thus then he argues; I aſſure you all to whom I write, that GOD work<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  <hi>The next Text is</hi> Rom. viii. 7.8. <hi>The carnal Mind is En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt GOD: for it is not ſubject to the Law of GOD, neither indeed can be. So then they that are in the Fleſh cannot pleaſe GOD.</hi>

               <p>To be in the Fleſh, is to be under the Dominion of Vice, to be a Slave to Sin, and it don't import, that they who are in the Fleſh cannot come out of that wretched State, that they who are wicked can't become good Men by the Grace GOD ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to them. It only ſignifies that ſo far as they act from a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious or fleſhly Mind, ſo far their Actions are diſpleaſing to GOD; as when it is ſaid of a good Man, that he ſinneth not neither indeed can he ſin; it only means ſo far as he is good, and acts up to his Character, he cannot ſin. Not but that a Man who is a Child of GOD can and does ſin, but then he acts not as a Child of GOD, but inconſiſtently with his Character. So when it is ſaid, he that is in the Fleſh cannot pleaſe GOD, it means, that whatever he does by Virtue of this fleſhly or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Mind is offenſive to GOD, but at the ſame Time he might act contrary to the Fleſh, and mortify it by divine Help, and ſo far as he does ſo, he pleaſes GOD, and as ſoon as ever he has got the Maſtery over the Fleſh, he is a good Man and in the Spirit; but yet is ſtill liable to be too much influenced by the Fleſh, and ſo far as he is ſo, he offends GOD, although he be a good Man. So that ſuch Expreſſions in the Scripture are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently cited to prove that a Sinner can do nothing towards his own Converſion; or that his Converſion don't at all depend upon his concurring with Grace.</p>

For his Power which was his Father's, was ſuperior to all other Powers: it is evident, that Chriſt here ſpeaks of plucking them away by Violence: not a Word here of their not being able wilfully to deſert him.

               <p>This is certainly ſpoken of the Body of the Jewiſh Nation, which at that very Time were given up by GOD to Blindneſs of Mind and Hardneſs of Heart; in which they have continued from that Day to this, and it only denotes that GOD has not ſo caſt them off but that he will receive them again, upon their believing and repenting. And it will not hold al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways true, that GOD does not repent of, or revoke his Gifts beſtowed upon Men: how often does he give and take away.

Did GOD expect any Thing leſs from his peculiar People, than that they ſhould be a holy People as he was a holy GOD.

Juſt thus—When the Spirit of Grace illuminates the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's Underſtanding, it neceſſitates his free Conſent to the Goſpel Call.</hi> P. 108. <hi>It is a Contradiction and impoſſible in the Nature of Things, that a good Man ſhould be willing to be wicked."</hi> P. 134.</p>

               <p>That this is falſe, I dare appeal to your own Conſcience. Have you as full a Belief of the Goſpel, as you have that two and three make five? Have you no more Doubts about any Truths of Chriſtianity, than you have whether Five be a leſſer Number than Five Hundred? If ſo, then your Faith has no Virtue in it, is worthy of no Praiſe or Reward, and is no Effect of the Will. For what Choice of the Will is there in believing that Two and Three make Five? If this be true, then your Faith is perfect the very firſt Moment, and can never grow, and you have no Need to pray, <hi>Lord increaſe our Faith, I believe, Lord help my Unbelief.</hi> I acknowledge Chriſt could make himſelf ſo manifeſt to every one, as that we ſhould be no more able to doubt, or refuſe his Offer than to doubt of our own Exiſtence. But this would be inconſiſtent with a State of Probation, or living by Faith. This would not be Faith, but Sight, and peculiar to the Saints and Angels in Heaven. See a Specimen of the Arrogance and Pride that is cheriſhed by theſe Doctrines! With what Scorn do they look down upon us poor Wretches, who have nothing but <hi>common Grace!</hi> I confeſs if this be their ſpecial Grace, I have it not; nor do I ever expect it in this State of Probation. Nor have I ever ſeen any Signs of it among them, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their Boaſting (like the Quakers of their Light within) on Purpoſe to inveigle weak People.

               <p>
                  <hi>I think the Sum of what he has ſaid is this, that GOD does not really will that all Sinners in general ſhould be converted, his Oath means no more, than that when any Sinner is converted it is acceptable to GOD. For if he did really will the Converſion of all Sinners, he would certainly convert all, for nothing can hinder GOD from accompliſhing his Will.</hi>

               <p>That is indeed his Argument: But it is a very great Miſtake, to think that GOD always by his infinite Power does accompliſh every Thing that he would have his Creatures do. If this be true, then GOD is not willing that any Men ſhould o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him, who do not actually obey him, then he is not willing that any ſhould repent, who don't repent, he is not willing that one Soul ſhould be good and obtain Salvation, who don't actually obtain it. And then what Sincerity is there in all GOD's earneſt and paſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Wiſhes? Pſ. lxxxi. 12. <hi>O that my People had hearken'd unto me!

If this Notion of Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi>'s be juſt then, no wicked Man in the World does, or can do any Thing contrary to GOD's Will, for if it were contrary to his Will GOD would hinder him by his exceeding great Power.

               <p>Here is another Miſtake; a ſincere Repentance of all our Sins, a giving up our ſelves to Chriſt with a full Reſolution to obey him till Death, is certainly the antecedent Condition of the Pardon of our Sins; and no Man's Sins are pardoned before he performs this good Work: And a perſevering in Well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till Death, is the antecedent Condition of our full and final Juſtification in the Day of Judgment; which is the only perfect Juſtification before GOD. This is the Tenor of the Goſpel, <hi>Repent and your Sins ſhall be blotted out— Be thou faithful unto the Death, and I will give thee the Crown of Life.</hi>

               <p>This is another Error. For though a Man is in a State of Acceptance with GOD immediately upon his ſincere cloſing with Chriſt, and giving up himſelf to be ruled and ſaved by him, even before ever he has had an Opportunity to perform one external good Work, yet this cloſing with Chriſt is Goſpel Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience

And our being obedient till Death is the Condition of our full, perfect, and final Juſtification in the Day of Judgment, Mark xvi. 16. <hi>He that believeth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved.</hi> That Faith by which we are firſt juſtified, is not a meer Aſſent of the Underſtanding, but contains in it a ſincere Reſolution to obey Chriſt till Death; and as this Faith is a good Work of our own, and goes before every Sort of Juſtification, ſo it vertually contains in it all good Works: Which muſt preceed our final Juſtification.</p>

               <p>I am ſure the Scripture doth not reckon after this Manner, Juſtification in this Life conſiſts in the Pardon of our Sins, and the Approbation of GOD, neither of which are perfect here. Good and juſtified Men do often offend GOD, and need a new Pardon, otherwiſe they need not repent, or pray for Pardon. Upon <hi>David</hi>'s Repentance of his Murder and Adultery, GOD pardoned his Sin ſo far as to remit the heavier Part of the Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, <hi>viz.</hi> temporal and eternal Death; but yet he did not perfectly pardon him and exempt him from Puniſhment, for that Sin the Child muſt die, and the Sword muſt never depart from his Houſe, and a Series of dreadful Puniſhments muſt follow him to the Day of his Death. 2 Sam. xii. 14. <hi>The Lord hath put away thy Sin,</hi> here is his Pardon and Juſtification, <hi>Howbeit the Child ſhall ſurely die</hi>—Indeed we ſhall not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly juſtified, until the general Judgment; when Soul and Body which have as a Puniſhment for Sin been ſeparated, ſhall be reunited, and the eternal Judge having compared our Lives with the Law of Faith and Covenant of Grace, ſhall pronounce the final Sentence, <hi>Come ye bleſſed.</hi>

               <p>Here is a full Diſcovery that his Hypotheſis and Notion of Juſtification was entirely wrong. For, ſays he, we are not juſtified neither in whole, nor in Part, nor in any Reſpect by our own Works of Obedience, i. e. Nothing that we do juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies us in any Degree, or in any Reſpect; Whereby he has Point blank contradicted our bleſſed Saviour, who ſays Matth. xii. 37. <hi>By the Words ſhalt thou be juſtified,</hi> and the governing of our
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:006094_0071_10278500DF2B9D40"/>Tongues is a Part of our Goſpel-Obedience. So has he in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Terms contradicted St. <hi>James.</hi> Jam. ii. 24. <hi>You ſee then how that by Works a Man is juſtified, and not by Faith only.</hi> So Luk. xviii. 14.

No, ſays Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi> we are not juſtified by theſe Things neither in Part, nor in any Reſpect whatſoever. When the Scripture ſo expreſly teaches that we are juſtified by our Works, it becomes us modeſtly to enquire in what Reſpect, or in what Part this is: But in comes Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi> like <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> he will not ſpend Time to untie, but immediately cuts the <hi>Gordian</hi> Knot, and plumply denies there is any ſuch Thing. But certainly ſince there is a moſt expreſs and full Contradiction between our Lord Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> on the one Side, and Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi> on the other; the one or the other Party muſt be miſtaken.

               <p>To this I anſwer with Dr. <hi>Whitby,</hi> 
                  <q>It is obſervable, that though this Argument be offered in Favour of the Decrees of abſolute Election and Reprobation, yet doth it plainly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw them, or render them ſuperfluous. For be it that theſe Decrees were made from Eternity; yet ſeeing GOD's Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of the Events of all Men, was alſo from Eternity, muſt he not know what would be the Condition of all Men when he made theſe Decrees? And what Need then could there be of a Decree for that Event which was infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by Virtue of his Foreknowledge without that Decree? Either GOD foreſaw theſe Events, independently on, and in the ſame Moment that he made theſe Decrees; and then ſeeing the Objects of both theſe Decrees are the ſame indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual Perſons, which he ſaw then would certainly be faved,
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:006094_0072_10278504767C93F0"/>or periſh independently upon them, what Need could there be of theſe Decrees to aſcertain that Event, which his own Foreknowledge had render'd certain and infallible?</q> So that Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi> in granting an eternal divine Foreknowledge of all Events, has entirely given up the Notion of eternal abſolute Decrees, or made them altogether needleſs and ſuperfluous. — Or elſe if he pretends, that GOD only <q>foreſaw theſe future Contingencies by Virtue of his Decrees, that they ſhould come to paſs;</q> then muſt he hold that GOD's Decrees are before his Foreknowledge, and the Reaſon of it: And if ſo, then this Argument of his does not in the leaſt Degree leſſen the Horror of them: But leaves that Notion obnoxious to all thoſe dreadful Conſequences I mentioned and a Thouſand more. And this Sort of Foreknowledge <q>muſt be attended with a fatal Neceſſity: Though in this Caſe it is not GOD's Foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but his Decrees, which creates that Neceſſity; all Things upon this Suppoſition being neceſſary; that is, ſuch as cannot otherwiſe be, not becauſe GOD foreknows them; but becauſe by his immutable Decrees he hath made them neceſſary; <hi>i. e.</hi> he foreknows becauſe they are neceſſary, but doth not make them neceſſary by foreknowing them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>GOD's Foreknowledge has no Influence at all upon my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, it is no Cauſe at all of my Salvation or Damnation. <q>
                     <hi>Foreknowledge is Knowledge, and Knowledge depends on the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of Things known, and not they on it."</hi> Should GOD by immediate Revelation give me the Knowledge of the Event of any Man's State or Actions, would my Knowledge of them have any Influence upon his Actions? Surely none at all, and yet my Knowledge as far as it is thus communicated, would be as certain and intallible as is that of GOD's. To illuſtrate this in ſome Meaſure by the Compariſon of our own Knowledge, we know certainly that ſome Things are, and that ſome Things will be.</q> I know my good Friend is dead, I know certainly there will be a Reſurrection, and <q>when I know theſe Things are, or will be, they cannot but be, yet manifeſt it is, that our Knowledge doth not at all affect the Things we thus know, or make them either more certain, or more future than they would be without it. Now Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge in GOD is Knowledge; as therefore Knowledge has no Influence on Things that are, ſo neither has Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge on Things that ſhall be. And conſequently the Foreknowledge of any Action that would be otherwiſe free,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:006094_0073_1026E7BB50FE8A48"/>cannot alter or diminiſh that Freedom: Whereas GOD's Decree of Election [is his Will concerning the Event.] it is powerful and active, and comprehends the Preparation and Exhibition of ſuch Means as ſhall unfruſtrably produce the End. And his Decree of Reprobation (is his Will and Pleaſure) it is active, as far as Action is required, to render a Man deficient, and therefore ſinful of Neceſſity, it being a Decree of withholding from the Objects of it, that Grace which can alone enable them to do what GOD commands, or to avoid what GOD forbids on the ſevereſt Penalty. Now Sin having no efficient but only a deficient Cauſe, it conſiſting only in not doing what is commanded, and not avoiding what is forbidden, that which renders it neceſſary for me to be thus deficient muſt lay me under a Neceſſity of ſinning. — GOD's Foreknowledge renders no Action neceſſary, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it would lay a Neceſſity upon his own Actions, for he foreknew from all Eternity that he would create a World, that he would ſend his Son, &amp;c. but this did not make it neceſſary that he ſhould create a World or ſend his Son, why then ſhould it be conceived that it lays a Neceſſity upon human Actions, or impairs the Freedom of them? Now if Foreknowledge doth not impair the Freedom of our Actions any more than if GOD had no ſuch Foreknowledge, and it be reaſonable to give Precepts, and render Exhortations and Motives to Men free to perform what is required, and what they are exhorted and thus moved to, it muſt be reaſonable thus to deal with Men, notwithſtanding GOD's Foreknowledge of their Actions; but it is not ſo with Reſpect to GOD's Decrees, his Decree of Election comprehending not only the End, but the Means to it, as to be wrought by his ſpecial Grace and unfruſtrable Operation, which I cannot reſiſt, if I cannot have the Will to reſiſt it; and that I cannot have, if this Operation determines my Will to Act in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with it: And where the Sin conſiſts in a Defect i. e. the not doing what is required, and the not avoiding what is forbidden, the Decree of with holding that Grace without which that Effect is neceſſary, is a Decree that the Sin ſhould be inevitable, and to the Objects of it neceſſary. — Moreover GOD's Foreknowledge reaches all Things, not only thoſe which will be, but alſo thoſe which may be, he foreſees not only what will be done, but alſo after what Manner it will be done, that free Actions will be done freely, and ſo his Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:006094_0074_102785115AEAA7D0"/>muſt rather eſtabliſh than take away our Freedom; for if God foreſees that I might abſtain from what he ſees I will not abſtain, and that I might will and do, what I neither will nor do, as he muſt if he ſees I act freely, then he ſees that I might not periſh, when he ſees that I will periſh, and he ſees that I might be willing and obedient, and ſo be ſaved, when he ſees that I will not be ſaved. And then there muſt be Place and equitable Grounds for all his Admonitions, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations and Motives not to periſh but to turn and live, becauſe they are only Exhortations. Commands and Motives to do, and to abſtain from that which he ſees that I may freely do, or may abſtain from, and therefore muſt have Power ſo to do.</q> So that there is an infinite Difference between the Conſequences of GOD's Foreknowledge as held by us, and the Conſequences of the abſolute Decrees as held by the Calviniſts.</p>
               <p>Now let me briefly take Notice of one or two Things in his concluding Addreſs. 1. He inſinuates, as though we kept Men off from an entire Reliance on Chriſt. This I eſteem very injurious, and ſlanderous. No, GOD forbid that I ſhould do any Thing like this. I rely as entirely, as wholly, as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, and as unreſervedly on my bleſſed and only Redeemer Jeſus Chriſt for Salvation, as any Calviniſt on Earth. Chriſt is all in all to my Soul, in him are all my Hopes for Aſſiſtance both to begin, continue, and end my chriſtian Courſe, to obtain a Pardon not only for the Myriads of Myriads of my Sins (which I committed while he gave me Grace to do better) but even for the Pardon of my beſt Duties, on Chriſt I depend for all I need in this Life, and all I hope for to Eternity. On him I depend not only as the Meriter but as the Beſtower of all. Only herein (perhaps) I differ from you, I think Chriſt will allow me no Intereſt in him, he will not own me as his Diſciple, unleſs I depart from all Iniquity, and obey him. Here, here is all my Fear, and all my Concern.</p>

               <p>But ſuppoſing you <hi>were all holy, even every one of you,</hi> yet this is not the Effect of Calviniſtic Notions, but by Virtue of our Principles, which in ſpight of all you can do, you can't help but believe, and our Doctrine is all you have to keep you back from Wickedneſs. And if any of you are wicked (as I hope not) yet this is not ſo much the Fault of the Man as of his Principles, whereas if we are vicious (as is too true) it is the Man and not his Principles that is to be blamed. — Chriſtianity is the beſt, and the only true Religion in the World: and yet ſome Chriſtians are the very worſt of Men. Will you then renounce Chriſtianity upon that Account. Never was true Chriſtianity ſet in a better Light than at this Day in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Never was any Scheme better calculated to make Men wiſe and good Chriſtians: and if we are vicious, we are of all Men on Earth the moſt inexcuſable.</p>
               <p>But with all I muſt obſerve, that different Sects have different Notions about Piety, and wherein it conſiſts. As you know the holy Phariſees differ'd in their Sentiments about real Holineſs from our bleſſed Lord, and accounted him a very looſe Liver.

It is amazing to obſerve what horrid Crimes were perpetrated by thoſe Men, who pretended to your ſpecial Grace and had their Mouths full of religious Cant. And what did theſe Principles end in but a monſtrous Variety of Hereſies, and even Atheiſm itſelf?

               <p>I hate this painting and diſguiſing one's Sentiments in Religion. I'll receive nothing as an Article of divine Faith which I am aſham'd to ſhew naked to the World. Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> (give him his Due) was a very great, and a very honeſt Man, he ſpoke his Opinion frankly, becauſe he believed it to be a divine Truth: But theſe Gentlemen turn into a thouſand different Shapes, ſo that it is impoſſible to know one of them when you meet him, whether he be a Calviniſt or an Arminian: I have but one Mark or Criterion to know them by, and that is, they always ſeem to bear a mortal Hatred againſt the Uſe of Reaſon and Common Senſe in Religion, and will certainly pick a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with you if you talk intelligibly about Chriſtianity. Now as to your other Queſtion, I ſeriouſly declare, that I firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe that all thoſe horrible Things are inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from Calviniſm. I hoped, but alas my Hopes were vain! that Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi> would have at leaſt attempted to ſhew me how I might have ſeparated them from his Doctrines. And whereas you think you ſee clearly, that they have no Connexion with Calviniſm, I therefore beſeech you for my Soul's Sake, let me into this Myſtery, and ſhew me how I may ſee, as you do. You know it is a common Saying with your Miniſters, that every Man is naturally a Hater of GOD, and if you don't know the Time when you hated GOD, wiſhed there were no GOD, and would gladly dethrone him, you are not converted. And truly their Doctrines of Predeſtination, original Sin, ſpecial Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and denying a Sufficiency of Grace to all but the Elect (as I underſtand them) make ſuch an injurious and frightful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation

<pb n="81" facs="unknown:006094_0078_1027851ACC401FA8"/>Power to prevent, as one whoſe Love to the Souls of Men is ſo very little, that when all might have been redeemed by Chriſt's Paſſion as well as a few, he of his meer Pleaſure choſe that the bigger Part by far of them who equally needed it, and would have equally improved it, ſhould be excluded, and ſhut out, and have no Part or Share in it; not becauſe it would have made any Addition to Chriſt's Sufferings, but merely becauſe GOD did not chuſe that they ſhould be ſaved And though he declares his moſt tender Love to Mankind, and his compaſſionate Concern for their Salvation, and intreats them to be happy, and ſwears to them that he does not will their Death, but their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and Life, and aſks them affectionately, why they will die? and how long it will be ere they be made clean? and what could be done for them more? and wiſhes they would hearken to him, and ſays, O that thou hadſt known the Things that belong to thy Peace, yet notwithſtanding all this Show of Mercy, his ſecret Decree and unchangeable Will and Deſire is, that the moſt of them ſhall burn forever in that Fire prepared for the obſtinate Devil and his Angels. And therefore would not that his Son ſhould effectually redeem them, or his Spirit yield them ſufficient Grace, without which he knew, they could no more eſcape Hell than they could ſhun Death. Now when we repreſent GOD to our Minds ſurrounded with this amazing Horror, how can we prevent our Hearts riſing againſt him, and wiſhing there was no ſuch GOD. I profeſs for my Part, I had rather a Million Times, never to have had a Being, than to think thus of GOD.—And why this horrible Repreſentation of GOD ſhould be called <hi>A Vindication of Sovereign free Grace,</hi> is paſt my Comprehenſion, unleſs it be ironically. That any Man ſhould be found, that can think ſo unworthily of GOD, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute ſuch cruel Things to the Father, of Mercies, is very ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing! But what is ſtill more wonderful, is, that they ſhould ſo ſtrangely affront common Senſe, and the Reaſon of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, as to ſtile theſe horrible Tenets, the <hi>Doctrines of Free Grace;</hi> As if the fewer GOD was willing to ſave, the freer and richer his Grace muſt be.
