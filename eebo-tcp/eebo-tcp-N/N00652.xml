            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Queſtion diſcourſed by <hi>James,</hi> is, <hi>Whether a man pretending to Faith in the Righteouſneſs of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall be ſaved, though he continue without the works of an Holy Life, agreeable thereunto</hi>? The Anſwer to this Queſtion is, <hi>No,</hi> Such a man ha's no <hi>Saving Faith</hi> at all. And that <hi>James</hi> is to be taken in that ſenſe, is evident from. This: He does inſiſt upon the Inſtance of <hi>Abraham</hi>; and yet <hi>Abraham</hi> was a <hi>Juſtified man,</hi> Thirty years, before thoſe <hi>Works,</hi> which are ſaid here to <hi>Juſtify</hi> him. Upon the whole then, we ſee <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, or, indeed, never contrdicting. And we are Adviſed after all; Tis a <hi>Vanity</hi> in any man to <hi>Profeſs,</hi> that he ha's a <hi>True Faith</hi> in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, if his <hi>Faith</hi> be not <hi>Fruitful</hi> in thoſe <hi>Good Works,</hi> which may <hi>Juſtify</hi> the mans <hi>Profeſſion.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Firſt; The <hi>Matter</hi> of our <hi>Works</hi> muſt be, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Law</hi> of God, or, His <hi>Will</hi> Revealed in His <hi>Word.</hi> The Prophet could ſay, in Mic. 6.8. <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, O man, the thing that is Good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to Do Juſtice, and to Love Mercy, and to walk Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly with thy God.

                  </gap>
               </hi>; for we have the <hi>Word</hi> of our God for them; as in Pſal. 92.1. <hi>It is a Good Thing to give Thanks unto the Lord.</hi> Works of <hi>Charity</hi> are <hi>Good Works</hi>; for we have the <hi>word</hi> of our God for them; as in Heb. 13.16. <hi>To Do Good, and to Communicate, forget not.</hi> No works are <hi>Good,</hi> but ſuch as are contained in the <hi>Two Tables</hi> of the <hi>Ten Commandments</hi>; the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and of <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But unto the Conſtitution of <hi>Good Works,</hi> it is <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ot enough, that the <hi>matter</hi> of what we do, be <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ccording to the <hi>Law</hi> of God. Men may do <hi>Works</hi> that ſhall be <hi>Good</hi> for the <hi>matter</hi> of them, and yet, <hi>Every work of their Hands be unclean, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aith the Lord. Plowing</hi> is Lawful, and <hi>Praying</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:000791_0009_0FAA53DA69913C40"/>
is Lawful; and yet theſe <hi>works</hi> may be ſinful in the Doer of them. Wherefore,</p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>Manner</hi> of our <hi>Works,</hi> muſt be Right, as well as the <hi>Matter</hi> of them. A man may incur the Wrath of God, by his <hi>Good Works,</hi> if he do them not in any <hi>manner</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Law,</hi> as they ſhould be done. We find, in 1 Chron. 15.13. <hi>The Lord our God</hi> is offended at thoſe who <hi>Seek Him not after the due Order.</hi> No meer <hi>External Actions</hi> are to be E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed <hi>Good Works</hi>; there muſt <hi>Internal Cautions</hi> go along with them; elſe they are but the <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>Good Works,</hi> without the <hi>Form. Good Works</hi> muſt be done with <hi>Regular Circumſtances,</hi> if they would be called, <hi>Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Deſign</hi> of our <hi>Works</hi> muſt be Right, as well as the <hi>manner</hi> of them. The <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign</hi> which the <hi>Law</hi> of God has aſſigned for our <hi>Good Works,</hi> is, That the Great God, may be acknowledged, and magnified, and glorified: And the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of God, coming in, has aſſigned a further <hi>Deſign</hi> for them; namely, To expreſs our <hi>Gratitude</hi> unto our Lord-Redeemer, for His Redeeming of us. Thus 'tis Enjoined, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.30. <hi>Whatever ye do, do all to the Glory of God.</hi> An <hi>Evil Intention</hi> will utterly ſpoil any <hi>Go<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>
               </hi> And a meerly <hi>Selfiſh Intention</hi> is an <hi>Evil</hi> one <hi>Good Works</hi> muſt all be done, with an Eye, to the <hi>Honour</hi> of God, and the <hi>Service</hi> of Chriſt before any <hi>Temporal Advantage</hi> to <hi>Self</hi>: elſe the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000791_0010_0FAA53DAB677B9C0"/>
               <hi>Beſt Sacrifices</hi> are but an <hi>Abomination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Good Works</hi> muſt proceed from a <hi>Good <hi>Principle</hi>
               </hi>; or otherwiſe they will have no <hi>Real Goodneſs</hi> in them. Waters that Flow from a bitter and a poiſon'd <hi>Fountain,</hi> can't be <hi>Good.</hi> A <hi>Good Heart,</hi> Like a <hi>Good Fountain,</hi> muſt be the <hi>Principle,</hi> from whence <hi>Good Works</hi> are to flow. We are told, in Mat. 12.35. <hi>A Good man, out of the Good Treaſure of the Heart, bringeth forth Good Things.</hi> A <hi>Good Principle</hi> within, is a <hi>Good Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Heart. Works</hi> done meerly from a Principle of <hi>Slaviſh Fear,</hi> or <hi>Fleſhly Love,</hi> are not <hi>Good,</hi> tho' they be never ſo <hi>Good.</hi> There muſt be a <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Reſpect unto God in Chriſt,</hi> woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us unto all our <hi>Good Works,</hi> or elſe they are <hi>Stark Naught.</hi> Yea, the <hi>Spirit</hi> of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, muſt be in us, as a <hi>Vital Principle,</hi> for our <hi>Good Works,</hi> or elſe they are <hi>Dead Works,</hi> every one of them. Hence, no <hi>Good Works</hi> were ever done by any one <hi>Unregenerate</hi> man, ſince the World began; for every <hi>Unregenerate</hi> man is deſtitute of the <hi>Principle,</hi> which is to be acted in them: the moſt <hi>Splendid Works</hi> of the Unregenerate, are but (as <hi>Auſtin</hi> call'd them) <hi>Splendid Sins</hi> before the Lord.</p>
            <p>And now there is a Second <hi>Caſe</hi> which a Chriſtian has to conſider, that ſo he may be ſtirred up, and helped on, to do thoſe <hi>Good Works</hi> by which he may approve himſelf indeed a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:000791_0011_0FAA53DB9370B710"/>Where Lies the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of Good Works, in a Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Believer, to Juſtifie the Faith, which he is a Profeſſor of?</p>
            <p>Now we do know this; That our <hi>Good Works</hi> are not <hi>Antecedently</hi> neceſſary unto our <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification</hi> before the God of Heaven. For <hi>Good VVorks</hi> cannot be done by any man, <hi>until</hi> he be <hi>Juſtified.</hi> Until a man be <hi>United</hi> unto the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is our <hi>Life,</hi> he is a <hi>Dead man:</hi> and what <hi>Good Works</hi> can a <hi>Dead man</hi> do? This is a thing <hi>Livelily</hi> Preached unto us, by our Lord Himſelf, in the fifteenth Chapter of <hi>John; The mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it.</hi> Hence that common ſaying of <hi>Auſtin, Bona Opera ſequuntur Juſtificatum, non praecedunt Juſtificandum.</hi> No, nor is <hi>Faith</hi> it ſelf, <hi>As</hi> doing of <hi>Good Works,</hi> that which Entitles us unto the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for our <hi>Juſtification</hi>; 'Tis <hi>Faith,</hi> only <hi>As</hi> it Layes Hold on the <hi>Righteouſneſs of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for the chief of Sinners,</hi> that <hi>Juſtifies</hi> us; And until this be done, we cannot be carried forth unto any <hi>Good Works</hi> at all.</p>
            <p>But then, <hi>Good Works,</hi> are <hi>conſequently</hi> neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry upon our <hi>Juſtification.</hi> 'Tis indeed ſaid, That <hi>God Juſtifies the Ungodly</hi>; but then, He does not Leave them <hi>Ungodly</hi> when He hath <hi>Juſtified</hi> them. Well, And where Lies the <hi>Neceſſity?</hi> Truly, if we would not be <hi>vain men,</hi> we muſt <hi>Know</hi> ſuch Things as theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:000791_0012_0FAA53DC2DD86B70"/>Firſt, <hi>Wilt thou know, O man?</hi> That it is in the very <hi>Nature</hi> of a <hi>Juſtifying Faith,</hi> to put a man upon the Doing of <hi>Good Works.

Juſtifying Faith</hi> is a <hi>Tree,</hi> which cannot but have the <hi>Good Fruits</hi> of <hi>Good Works</hi> growing upon it. It is the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> of God, that <hi>Creates,</hi> and that <hi>Beſtows,</hi> a <hi>Juſtifying Faith,</hi> wherever it is; and that <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> cannot ſuffer any Soul, in which He dwells, to be wholly Remiſs about the <hi>Good Works</hi> which are agreeable unto His <hi>Holineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Briefly; 'Tis in the very <hi>Nature</hi> of a <hi>Saving

Faith</hi> to be a <hi>Working Faith.</hi> The Scriptures of Truth, aſſure us, in Gal. 5.6. <hi>Faith works, by Love.</hi> It was well ſaid, therefore by <hi>John Hus, Ubi Bona Opera non apparent ad extra, ibi Fides non eſt ad intra: Faith</hi> is not <hi>within,</hi> if <hi>Good VVorks</hi> are not <hi>without.

Bellarmine</hi> himſelf, who had Lived ſo Blameleſly, that he was not conſcious of his ever having once told a <hi>Lye,</hi> and when he came to <hi>Auricular Confeſſion</hi> he could find nothing to mention, without Looking back ſo far as his Childhood, yet when his Death was arreſting him, he durſt no more truſt unto the merit of his <hi>Good works,</hi> but would have that clauſe inſerted in his Will, That he deſired the Lord to Receive him, <hi>Non ut aeſtimator meriti, ſed ut Largitor veniae</hi>; Not on <hi>Merit,</hi> but in <hi>Mercy!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we are in the next place to be Adviſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That having firſt <hi>Believed</hi> on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that we may be <hi>Juſtified,</hi> we do then A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in thoſe <hi>Good works,</hi> which are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Genuine Symptoms of <hi>Believers</hi>; thoſe <hi>Good works,</hi> which the Oracles of Heaven call, <hi>The Fruits of Righteouſneſs.</hi> We ſhould, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaks, in 1 Cor. 15.58. <hi>Always abound in the work of the Lord.</hi> The Bible ha's no <hi>Good words</hi> any where, for thoſe <hi>Antinomian</hi> Wretches, with whom <hi>Good works</hi> are deſpiſed &amp; neglected: It ſpits nothing but Sulphureous Fire, in the Faces of thoſe <hi>Libertines</hi>! If we are deſtitute of <hi>Good works,</hi> we have none but a <hi>Dead Faith,</hi> and a <hi>Dead Faith</hi> will very little befriend a <hi>Dead Soul.</hi> To have no <hi>Good works</hi> then, is a woful Thing: and, the Praemonition is, in Math. 3.10. <hi>Every Tree which bringeth not forth Good Fruit, is hewn down, &amp; caſt into the Fire</hi>: What then will be the Wo, how wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

will be the Doom of thoſe that are full of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil works,</hi> and bring forth much of that <hi>Evil Fruit,</hi> which grows on the <hi>Vine of Sodom, &amp; in the Field of Gomorrah?</hi> Sad will it be for us to periſh among <hi>Unbelievers,</hi> after we have ſeemed mightily <hi>to Believe</hi>; &amp; after a fair ſhow of our <hi>Faith,</hi> to be Damn'd among, <hi>The workers of Iniquity.</hi> Surely, I<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> we would with the <hi>Joy of Faith,</hi> be Satisfied, that the <hi>Seal of the Holy Spirit,</hi> which we ſeem to have, when we Entertain our Aſſurance, <hi>That the Righteouſneſs of God, which is by the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt is upon us,</hi> is not a Cheat, a Sham, a Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deluding <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> it becomes us, with a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant <hi>Zeal</hi> for <hi>Good works,</hi> to <hi>Exerciſe our ſelves, at keeping a Conſcience void of Offence towards God and man.</hi> It becomes us, to Ponder, How much we <hi>Owe</hi> unto our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and Study, How to <hi>Serve</hi> the Lord that ha's <hi>Bought</hi> us; &amp; with <hi>Good works</hi> alwayes to be at work for Him. It becomes us, to forethink, How little Time we have to be <hi>Working</hi> in, how near we are to the Time where there can be no <hi>Working,</hi> and to Do as many <hi>Good works,</hi> as we can in our Time; yea, to call our ſelves unto a <hi>Daily Account,</hi> with unſpeakable Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if we have let one Day paſs without many of them. It becomes us even to raiſe our <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Natural,</hi> as well as <hi>Religious works,</hi> unto the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of <hi>Good works,</hi> by the moſt Frequent, moſt Explicit, &amp; moſt Ennobling <hi>Dedications</hi> of all our <hi>Works,</hi> unto the Lord. So, it will not be long before we <hi>reſt from our Labours,</hi> but <hi>our Works will follow us.</hi>
