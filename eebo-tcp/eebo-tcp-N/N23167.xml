            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>AT a time when the nobility of Britain were ſaid, by the Poet Laureat, to admire and protect the arts, and were known by the whole nation to be the patrons of muſic,—William and Henry, youths under twenty years of age, brothers, and the ſons of a country ſhopkeeper who h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d lately died inſolvent, ſet out on foot for London, in the hope of procuring by their induſtry a ſcanty ſubſiſtence.</p>
                     <p>As they walked out of their native town, each with a ſmall bundle at his back, each ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the other drop ſeveral tears; but, upon the ſudden meeting of their eyes, they both ſmil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a degree of diſdain at the weakneſs in which they had been caught.</p>
                     <p>"I am ſure," ſaid William (the elder) "I don't know why I cry."</p>
                     <p>"Nor I neither," ſaid Henry: "for though
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:030623_0004_0FE7ED561C5CAE60"/>
we may never ſee this town again, yet we leave nothing behind us to give us cauſe to lament,"</p>
                     <p>"No," replied William; "nor any body who cares what becomes of us."</p>
                     <p>"But I was thinking," ſaid Henry, now weeping bitterly, "that if my poor father were alive, <hi>be</hi> would care what was to become of us:—he would not have ſuffered us to begin this long journey without a few ſhillings more in our pockets."</p>
                     <p>At the end of this ſentence, William, who had with ſome effort ſuppreſſed his tears while his brother ſpoke, now uttered, with a voice al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt inarticulate,—"Don't ſay any more; don't talk any more about it. My father uſed to tell us, that when he was gone we muſt take care of ourſelves: and ſo we muſt. I only wiſh," continued he, giving way to his grief, "that I had never done any thing to offend him while he was living."</p>
                     <p>"That is what I wiſh too," cried Henry. "If I had always been dutiful to him while he was alive, I would not ſhed one tear for him now that he is gone: but I would thank heaven that he had eſcaped from his creditors."</p>

when living, as they ought to have made him; and wherein their own outcaſt fortune was leſs the ſubject of their grief, than the reflection "what their father would have endured, could he have beheld them in their preſent ſituation;" in converſation ſuch as this, they purſued their journey till they arrived at that metropolis, which has received for centuries paſt, from the provincial towns, the bold adventurer of every denomination; has ſtampt his character with experience and example; and, while it has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on ſome coronets and mitres <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Their experience, ſince they came to town, had informed them that, to obtain a permanent live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood, is the good fortune but a part of thoſe who are in want of it: and the precarious earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of half a crown, or a ſhilling, in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood where they lodged, by an errand, or ſome ſuch accidental means, was the ſole ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port which they at preſent enjoyed.</p>
                     <p>They had ſought for conſtant employment of various kinds, and even for ſervants' places; but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">

                     <p>NO ſooner was it publicly known that Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry could play moſt excellently upon the violin, than he was invited into many companies where no other accompliſhment could have introduced him. His performance was ſo much admired,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:030623_0008_0FE83B3CF1673780"/>
that he had the honour of being admitted to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral tavern feaſts, of which he had alſo the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to partake without partaking of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. He was ſoon addreſſed by perſons of the very firſt rank and faſhion, and was once ſeen walking ſide by ſide with a peer.</p>
                     <p>But yet, in the midſt of this powerful occaſion for rejoicing, Henry, whoſe heart was particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly affectionate, had one grief that eclipſed all the happineſs of his new life:—his brother Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam could <hi>not</hi> play on the fiddle!—conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his brother William, with whom he had ſhared ſo much ill, could not ſhare in his good fortune.</p>
                     <p>One evening, Henry, coming home from a dinner and concert at the Crown and Anchor, found William, in a very gloomy and peeviſh humour, poring over <hi>De Oratore</hi> of Cicero. Henry aſked him ſeveral times "How he did;" and ſimilar queſtions, marks of his kind diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition towards his beloved brother: but all the endeavours, he perceived, could not ſoothe or ſoften the ſullen mind of William. At length, taking from his pocket a handful of almonds, and ſome delicious fruit (which he had purloin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the plenteous table, where his brother's wants had never been abſent from his thoughts)
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:030623_0009_0FE83B454DCBC8B8"/>
and laying them down before him, he exclaimed with a benevolent ſmile, "Do, William, let me teach you to play upon the violin."</p>
                     <p>William—full of the great orator whom he was then ſtudying, and ſtill more alive to the impoſſibility that <hi>his</hi> ear, attuned only to ſenſe, could ever deſcend from that elevation, to learn mere ſounds—William caught up the tempting preſents which Henry had ventured his reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to obtain for him, and threw them all indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantly at the donor's head.</p>
                     <p>Henry felt too powerfully his own ſuperiority of fortune, to reſent this ingratitude; he only picked up the repaſt, and laying it again upon the table, placed by its ſide a bottle of claret, which he held faſt by the neck, while he aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his brother, that, "although he had taken it while the waiter's back was turned, yet it might be drank with a ſafe conſcience by them; for he had not himſelf taſted one drop at the feaſt, on purpoſe that he might enjoy a glaſs with his brother at home, and without wronging the company who had invited him."</p>
                     <p>The affection Henry expreſſed as he ſaid this,—or the force of a bumper of wine, which Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam had not ſeen ſince he left his father's houſe,—had ſuch an effect in calming the diſpleaſure
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:030623_0010_0FE83B46D4E2E4B0"/>
he was cheriſhing, that, on his brother's offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him the glaſs, he took it; and he deigned even to eat of his preſent.</p>
                     <p>Henry, to convince him that he had ſtinted himſelf, to obtain for him this collation, ſat down and partook of it.</p>
                     <p>After a few glaſſes had paſſed, he again ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to ſay, "Do, brother William, let me teach you to play on the violin."</p>
                     <p>Again his offer was refuſed; but though with leſs vehemence, at length they both agreed the attempt could not proſper.</p>
                     <p>"Then," ſaid Henry, "William, go down to Oxford, or to Cambridge. There, no doubt, they are as fond of learning, as in this gay town they are of muſic. You know you have as much talent for the one as I for the other: do go to one of our univerſities, and ſee what din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, what ſuppers, and what friends <hi>you</hi> will find there."</p>

for the affectionate remittances of Henry, who ſhortly became ſo great a proficient in the art of muſic, as to have it in his power not only to live in a very reputable manner himſelf, but to ſend ſuch ſupplies to his brother, as to enable him to purſue his ſtudies.</p>
                     <p>With ſome, the progreſs of fortune is rapid. Such is the caſe when, either on merit or deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, great patronage is beſtowed. Henry's vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin had often charmed, to a welcome forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his inſignificance, an effeminate lord; or warmed with ideas of honour, the head of a duke, whoſe heart could never be taught to feel its manly glow. Princes had flown to the arms of their favourite fair-ones, with more rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous delight, ſoftened by the maſterly touches of his art: and thoſe elevated perſonages, ever grateful to thoſe from whom they derive bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, were competitors in the deſire of heaping favours upon him. But he, in all his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, never once loſt from his thoughts the hope of ſome advantage for his brother William: and when at any time he was preſſed by a patron to demand a "token of his regard," he would conſtantly reply:</p>
                     <p>"I have a brother, a very learned man, if your lordſhip (your grace, or your royal high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) would confer ſome ſmall favour on him—"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="12" facs="unknown:030623_0012_0FE83B4F47DC2178"/>
His lordſhip would reply, "He was ſo teaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and harraſſed in his youth by learned men, that he had ever ſince deteſted the whole frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity."</p>
                     <p>His grace would inquire "If the learned man could play upon any inſtrument."</p>
                     <p>And his highneſs would aſk "If he could ſing."</p>
                     <p>Rebuffs ſuch as theſe poor Henry met with in all his applications for William, till one for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate evening, at the concluſion of a concert, a great man ſhook him by the hand, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed a living of five hundred a year (the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent of which was upon his death-bed) to his brother, in return for the entertainment Henry had juſt given him.</p>
                     <p>Henry wrote in haſte to William, and began his letter thus: "My dear brother, I am not ſorry you did not learn to play upon the fid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle."</p>

                     <p>THE incumbent of this living died—Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam was ordained: and in a few weeks came to town, to take poſſeſſion of the gift, which his brother's ſkill had acquired him.</p>
                     <p>William had a ſteady countenance, a ſtern
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:030623_0013_0FE83B5644E65178"/>
brow, and a majeſtic walk; all of which this new acceſſion, this holy calling to religious vows, rather increaſed than diminiſhed. In the early part of his life, the violin of his brother had rather irritated than ſoothed the moroſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of his nature: and though, ſince their departure from their native habitation, it had frequently calmed the violent ragings of his hunger, it had never been ſucceſsful in appeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diſturbed paſſions of a proud and a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainful mind.</p>
                     <p>As the painter views with delight and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the finiſhed picture, expreſſive teſtimony of his taſte and genius: as the phyſician beholds with pride and gladneſs the recovering invalid, whom his art has ſnatched from the jaws of death: as the father gazes with rapture on his firſt child, the creature to whom he has given life—ſo did Henry ſurvey with tranſporting glory, his brother, dreſt for the firſt time in his canonicals, to preach at his pariſh church. He viewed him from head to foot—ſmiled—viewed again—pulled one ſide of his gown a little this way, one end of his band a little that way—then ſtole behind him, pretending to place the curls of his hair, but in reality, to indulge, and to conceal, tears of fraternal pride and joy.</p>
                     <p>William was not without joy: neither was
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:030623_0014_0FE83B57CB07EDC8"/>
he wanting in love or gratitude to his brother—but his pride was not completely ſatisfied.</p>
                     <p>"I am eldeſt brother," he thought to himſelf, "and a man of literature; and yet am I obliged to my younger, an illiterate man."—Here he ſuppreſſed every thought that could be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to that brother. But there remained an object of his former contempt, now become even deteſtable to him—ungrateful man! the very agent of his elevation was now ſo odious to him, that he could not caſt his eyes upon the friendly violin, without inſtant emotions of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt.</p>
                     <p>In vain would Henry at times endeavour to ſubdue his haughtineſs, by a tune on this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful machine.—"You know I have no ear," William would ſternly ſay, in recompenſe for one of Henry's beſt ſolo's. Yet was William enraged at Henry's anſwer, when, after taking him to hear him preach, he aſked him "how he liked his ſermon," and Henry replied (merely with pleaſantry, and in the technical phraſe of his profeſſion) "You know, brother, I have no ear."</p>
                     <p>Henry's renown in his profeſſion daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed; and with his ſame, his friends. Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing the virtues of humility and charity, far above William, the profeſt teacher of thoſe vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030623_0015_0FE83B5EB21BD1E0"/>
his reverend brother's diſreſpect for his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, never once made him relax for a moment in his anxiety to advance him in <hi>his.</hi>—Within a year or two, he had the gratification of preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to a deanery; and at once placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them an inſurmountable barrier to all friendſhip, that was not the effect of condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, on the part of the dean.</p>
                     <p>William would now begin ſeriouſly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate with his brother "upon his uſeleſs occupation," and would intimate "the degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation it was to him, to hear his frivolous ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſpoken of in all companies." Henry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved his brother much wiſer than himſelf, and ſuffered ſhame that he was not more worthy of ſuch a relation. To conſole himſelf for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar friend, whom he now perceived he had entirely loſt, he ſearched for one of a ſofter na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture—he married.</p>

                     <p>AS Henry deſpaired of receiving his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's approbation of his choice, he never men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the event to him: but William, being told of it by a third perſon, inquired of Henry, who confirmed the truth of the intelligence, and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:030623_0016_0FE83B6037F01950"/>
acknowledged, that, in taking a wife, his ſole view had been, to obtain a kind companion and friend, who would bear with his failings, and know how to eſteem his few qualifications; therefore, he had choſen one of his own rank in life, and who, having a taſte for muſic, and, as well as himſelf, an obligation to the art—</p>
                     <p>"And is it poſſible," cried the dean, "that what has been hinted to me is true? Is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that you have married a public ſinger?"</p>
                     <p>"She is as good as myſelf," returned Henry: "I did not wiſh her to be better, for fear ſhe ſhould deſpiſe me."</p>
                     <p>"As to deſpiſe," (anſwered the dean) "hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven forbid that we ſhould deſpiſe any one—that would be acting unlike a chriſtian—but do you imagine I can ever introduce her to my intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wife, who is a woman of family?"</p>
                     <p>Henry had received in his life many inſults from his brother: but, as he was not a vain man, he generally thought his brother in the right, and conſequently ſubmitted with patience—but, though he had little ſelf-love, he had for his wife an unbounded affection: on the preſent occaſion, therefore, he began to raiſe his voice, and even (in the coarſe expreſſion of clowniſh anger) to lift his hand—but the ſudden and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting recollection of what he had done for the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:030623_0017_0FE83B69DE575D50"/>
dean—of the pains, the toils, the hopes, and the fears he had experienced when ſoliciting his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment—this recollection overpowered his ſpeech—weakened his arm—and deprived him of every active force, but that of flying out of the dean's houſe (in which they then were) as ſwift as lightning, while the dean ſat proudly contemplating—"that he had done his duty."</p>
                     <p>For ſeveral days Henry did not call, as was his cuſtom, to ſee his brother: William's mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage drew near, and he ſent a formal card to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite him on that day; but not having had the condeſcenſion to name his ſiſter-in-law in the invitation, Henry took no notice of it; and the joyful event was celebrated without his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. But the ardour of the bridegroom was not ſo vehement as to overcome every other ſenſation—he miſſed his brother—that heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felt cheerfulneſs with which Henry had ever given him joy upon every happy occaſion—even amidſt all the politer congratulations of his other friends—ſeemed to the dean mournful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wanting. This derogation from his felicity he was reſolved to reſent—and for a whole year theſe brothers, whom adverſity had entwined cloſely together, proſperity ſeparated.</p>
                     <p>Though Henry, on his marriage, paid ſo
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030623_0018_0FE83B6B655023A8"/>
much attention to his brother's prejudices, as to take his wife from her public employment, this had not ſo entirely removed the ſcruples of William, as to permit him to think her a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy companion for Lady Clementina, the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a poor Scotch earl, whom he had choſen, merely that he might be proud of her family; though, in return, he ſhould ſuffer that family to be aſhamed of <hi>his.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If Henry's wife was not fit company for La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Clementina, it is to be hoped ſhe was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany for angels—ſhe died within the firſt year of her marriage, a faithful, an affectionate wife and a mother.</p>
                     <p>When William heard of her death, he felt a ſudden ſhock—and a kind of fleeting thought glanced acroſs his mind, that</p>
                     <p>"Had he known ſhe had been ſo near her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, ſhe might have been introduced to Lady Clementina: and he himſelf would have called her ſiſter."</p>
                     <p>That is (if he had defined his fleeting idea) "they would have had no objection to have met this poor woman for the <hi>laſt time;</hi> and would have deſcended to the familiarity of kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, in order to have wiſhed her a good journey to the other world."</p>
                     <p>Or, is there in death ſomething that ſo raiſes

the abjectneſs of the poor, that, on their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to its ſheltering abode, the arrogant believer feels the equality he had before denied, and trembles?</p>

                     <p>THE wife of Henry had been dead near ſix weeks before the dean heard the news: a month then elapſed in thoughts by himſelf, and conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations with Lady Clementina, how he ſhould conduct himſelf, on this occurrence. Her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was,</p>
                     <p>"That as Henry was the youngeſt, and by their ſtations, in every ſenſe, the dean's inferior, he ought firſt to make overtures of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion."</p>
                     <p>The dean anſwered, "He had no doubt of his brother's good will to him: but that he had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think, from the knowledge of his temper, he would be more likely to come to him upon an occaſion to beſtow comfort, than to receive it: for inſtance, if I had ſuffered the misfortune of loſing you, my brother, I have no doubt, would have forgotten his reſentment, and—"</p>
                     <p>She was offended that the loſs of the vulgar wife of Henry ſhould be compared to the loſs of her—ſhe lamented her indiſcretion in forming
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030623_0020_0FE83B73DD594288"/>
an alliance with a family of no rank, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored the dean to wait till his brother ſhould make ſome conceſſion to him, before he renewed the acquaintance.</p>
                     <p>Though Lady Clementina had mentioned on this occaſion her <hi>indiſcretion,</hi> ſhe was of a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent age—ſhe was near forty—yet, poſſeſſing rather a handſome face and perſon, ſhe would not have impreſſed the ſpectator with an idea that ſhe was near ſo old, had ſhe not conſtantly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to appear much younger. Her dreſs was fantaſtically faſhionable, her manners af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected all the various paſſions of youth, and her converſation was perpetually embelliſhed with accuſations upon her own "heedleſsneſs, thoughtleſsneſs, careleſsneſs, and childiſhneſs."</p>
                     <p>There is perhaps, in every individual, one parent motive to every action, good or bad: be that as it will, it was evident, that with Lady Clementina, all ſhe ſaid or did, all ſhe thought or looked, had but one foundation—vanity.—If ſhe was nice, or if ſhe was negligent, vanity was the cauſe of both; for ſhe would contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate with the higheſt degree of ſelf-compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency "what ſuch a one would ſay of her ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant preciſeneſs, or what ſuch a one would think of her intereſting neglect."</p>
                     <p>If ſhe complained ſhe was ill, it was with
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:030623_0021_0FE83B7A4AF874D8"/>
the certainty that her languor would be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; if ſhe boaſted ſhe was well, it was that the ſpectator might admire her glowing health; if ſhe laughed, it was becauſe ſhe thought it made her look pretty; if ſhe cried, it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe thought it made her look prettier ſtill. If ſhe ſcolded her ſervants, it was from vanity, to ſhow her ſuperior knowledge to theirs; and ſhe was kind to them, from the ſame vice, that her benevolence might excite their admiration. Forward and impertinent in the company of her equals, from the vanity of ſuppoſing herſelf above them, ſhe was baſhful even to ſhamefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedneſs in the preſence of her ſuperiors, becauſe her vanity told her ſhe engroſſed all their obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Through vanity ſhe had no memory; for ſhe conſtantly forgot every thing ſhe heard others ſay, from the minute attention which ſhe paid to every thing ſhe ſaid herſelf.</p>
                     <p>She had become an old maid from vanity, believing no offer ſhe received worthy of her deſerts; and when her power of farther conqueſt began to be doubted, ſhe married from vanity to repair the character of her fading charms. In a word, her vanity was of that magnitude, that ſhe had no idea but that ſhe was humble in her own opinion; and it would have been impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to have convinced her that ſhe thought well
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030623_0022_0FE83B7BD1D39D28"/>
of herſelf, becauſe ſhe thought <hi>ſo well,</hi> as to be aſſured, that her own thoughts under valued her.</p>

                     <p>THAT, which in a weak woman is called vanity, in a man of ſenſe is termed pride—make one a degree ſtronger, or the other a degree weaker, and the dean and his wife were infected with the ſelf-ſame folly. Yet, do not let the reader ſuppoſe that this failing (however deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picable) had eraſed from either boſom all traces of humanity. They are human creatures who are meant to be pourtrayed in this little book, and where is the human creature who has not ſome good qualities to ſoften, if not counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balance his bad ones?</p>
                     <p>The dean, with all his pride, could not wholly forget his brother, nor eradicate from his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance the friend he had been to him—he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved therefore, in ſpite of his wife's advice, to make him ſome overture, which he had no doubt but Henry's good nature would inſtantly accept. The more he became acquainted with all the vain and ſelfiſh propenſities of Lady Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentina, the more he felt a returning affection for his brother: but little did he ſuſpect how
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:030623_0023_0FE83B82AD629F30"/>
much he loved him, till (after ſending to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious places to enquire for him) he learnt—that on his wife's deceaſe, unable to ſupport her loſs in the ſurrounding ſcene, Henry had taken the child ſhe brought him in his arms, ſhaken hands with all his former friends—paſſing over his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the number—and ſet ſail in a veſſel bound for Africa, with a party of Portugueſe and ſome few Engliſh adventurers, to people there the uninhabited part of an extenſive iſland.</p>
                     <p>This was a reſolution, in Henry's circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, worthy a mind of ſingular ſenſibility: but William had not diſcerned, till then, that every act of Henry's was of the ſame deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and more than all, his every act towards him.—He ſtaggered when he heard the tidings; at firſt thought them untrue; but quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected that Henry was capable of ſurpriſing deeds! He recollected, with a force that gave him torture, the benevolence his brother had ever ſhown towards him—the favours he had heaped upon him—the inſults he had patiently endured in requital!</p>
                     <p>In the firſt emotion, which this intelligence gave the dean, he forgot the dignity of his walk and geſture—He ran with frantic enthuſiaſm to every corner of his houſe where the leaſt veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tige of what belonged to Henry remained—He
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:030623_0024_0FE83B8432CDCC60"/>
preſſed cloſe to his breaſt, with tender agony, a coat of his, which by accident had been left there—He kiſſed and wept over a walking-ſtick which Henry once had given him—He even took up a muſic-book of his brother's with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light—nor would his poor violin, had it been there, have then excited anger.</p>
                     <p>When his grief became more calm, he ſat in deep and melancholy meditation, calling to mind, when, and where he ſaw his brother laſt. The recollection gave him freſh cauſe of regret. He remembered they had parted on his refuſal to ſuffer Lady Clementina to admit the acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Henry's wife.—Both Henry and his wife he now contemplated beyond the reach of his pride; and he felt the meanneſs of his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.</p>
                     <p>To add to his ſelf-reproaches, he beheld in his tormented memory the countenance of his brother at their laſt interview, as it changed, while he cenſured his marriage, and treated with diſrepect the object of his conjugal affection. He remembered the anger repreſſed, the tear burſting forth, and the laſt glimpſe he had of him, as he left his preſence for ever.</p>
                     <p>In vain he now wiſhed, that he had followed him to the door—that he had once ſhaken hands and owned his obligations to him before they
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:030623_0025_0FE83B8B288590D0"/>
had parted. In vain he wiſhed too, that, in this extreme agony of his mind, he had ſuch a friend to comfort him, as Henry had ever proved.</p>

                     <p>THE avocations of an elevated life eraſe the deepeſt impreſſions—the dean, in a few months, recovered of thoſe which his brother's departure firſt made upon him; and would now at times even condemn, in anger, Henry's having ſo haſtily abandoned him and his native country, in reſentment, as he conceived, of a few mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes which his uſual fortitude ſhould have taught him to bear. Yet, was he ſtill deſirous of his return, and wrote two or three letters ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive of his wiſh, which he anxiouſly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured ſhould reach him. But many years elapſing without any intelligence from him, and a report having arrived that he, and all the party with whom he went, were ſlain by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage inhabitants of the iſland, William's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of ſeeing his brother again, cauſed the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to diminiſh; while attention and affection to a ſtill nearer and dearer relation than Henry ever was to him, now chiefly engaged his mind.</p>
                     <p>Lady Clementina had brought him a ſon, on whom, from his infancy, he doated—and the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:030623_0026_0FE83B8CAEC43E88"/>
boy, in riper years, poſſeſſing a handſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and evincing a quickneſs of parts, gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the father's darling paſſion, pride; as well as the mother's vanity.</p>
                     <p>The dean had, beſides this child, a domeſtic comfort highly gratifying to his ambition: the biſhop of **** became intimately acquainted with him ſoon after his marriage, and from his daily viſits had become, as it were, a part of the family. This was much honour to the dean, not only as the biſhop was his ſuperior in the church, but was of that part of the bench whoſe blood is ennobled by a race of anceſtors, and to which all wiſdom on the plebeian ſide crouches in humble reſpect.</p>
                     <p>Year after year rolled on in pride and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur; the biſhop and the dean paſſing their time in attending levees and in talking politics; La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Clementina paſſing hers in attending routs and in talking of <hi>herſelf,</hi> till the ſon arrived at the age of thirteen.</p>
                     <p>Young William paſſed <hi>his</hi> time, from morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till night, with perſons who taught him to walk, to ride, to talk, to think like a man—a fooliſh man, inſtead of a wife child, as nature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned him to be.</p>
                     <p>This unfortunate youth was never permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to have one conception of his own—all was

taught him—he was never once aſked "what he thought? but men were paid to tell him "how to think." He was taught to revere ſuch and ſuch perſons, however unworthy of his reverence; to believe ſuch and ſuch things how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever unworthy of his credit; and to act ſo and ſo, on ſuch and ſuch occaſions, however unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of his feelings.</p>
                     <p>Such were the leſſons of the tutors aſſigned him by his father—Thoſe maſters whom his mother gave him did him leſs miſchief; for though they diſtorted his limbs and made his manners effeminate, they did not interfere with the internal.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Norwynne (the family name of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and though but a ſchool-boy, he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Miſter</hi>) could talk on hiſtory, on politics, and on religion; ſurpriſingly to all who never liſtened to a parrot or a magpie—for he merely repeated what he had heard, without one reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the ſenſe or probability of his report. He had been praiſed for his memory, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue that praiſe, he was ſo anxious to retain every ſentence he had heard or he had read, that the poor creature had no time for one native idea, but only re-delivered his tutors' leſſons to his father, and his father's to his tutors. But, whatever he ſaid or did, was the admiration of
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:030623_0028_0FE83B9547F8A258"/>
all who came to the houſe of the dean, and who knew he was an only child—Indeed, conſidering the labour that was taken to ſpoil him, he was rather a commendable youth; for, with the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantic folly of his tutors, the blind affection of his father and mother, the obſequiouſneſs of the ſervants, and flattery of the viſitors, it was ſome credit to him that he was not an ideot or a brute—Though, when he imitated the manners of a man, he had ſomething of the latter in his appearance—for he would grin and bow to a lady, catch her fan in haſte if it fell, and hand her to her coach, as thoroughly void of all the ſentiment, which gives grace to ſuch tricks, as a monkey.</p>

                     <p>ONE morning in winter, juſt as the dean, his wife, and darling child, had finiſhed their breakfaſt at their houſe in London, a ſervant brought in a letter to his maſter, and ſaid "The man waited for an anſwer."</p>
                     <p>"Who is the man?" cried the dean with all that terrifying dignity, with which he never fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to addreſs his inferiors, eſpecially ſuch as wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on his perſon.</p>
                     <p>The ſervant replied with a ſervility of tone

equal to the haughty one of his maſter "he did not know, but that the man looked like a ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, and had a boy with him."</p>
                     <p>"A begging letter no doubt," cried Lady Clementina.</p>
                     <p>"Take it back," ſaid the dean, "and bid him ſend up word who he is, or what is his errand."</p>
                     <p>The ſervant went; and returning ſaid, "He comes from on board a ſhip, his captain ſent him, and his errand is, he believes, to leave a boy he has brought with him."</p>
                     <p>"A boy!" cried the dean, "what have I to do with a boy? I expect no boy. What boy? What age?"</p>
                     <p>"He looks about twelve or thirteen," repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſervant.</p>
                     <p>"He is miſtaken in the houſe," ſaid the dean. "Let me look at the letter again."</p>
                     <p>He did look at it, and ſaw it was directed plainly to himſelf—Upon a ſecond glance, he had ſo perfect a recollection of the hand as to open it inſtantaneouſly; and, after ordering the ſervant to withdraw, he read the following.</p>

                           </opener>
                           <p>IT is a long time ſince we have ſeen one another, but I hope not ſo long that you have quite forgotten the many happy days we once paſſed together.</p>

                              <pb n="30" facs="unknown:030623_0030_0FE83B9DCF777CE8"/>
I did not take my leave of you when I left England, becauſe it would have been to much for me—I had met with a great many ſorrows juſt at that time, one of which was, the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of loſing the uſe of my right hand by a fall from my horſe, which accident robbed me of moſt of my friends; for I could no longer entertain them with my performance as I uſed to do; and ſo I was aſhamed to ſee them or you; and that was the reaſon I came hither to try my fortune with ſome other adventurers.</p>
                           <p>You have I ſuppoſe heard, how the ſavages of the iſland put our whole party to death except myſelf. I was heart-broken for my comrades, but yet upon the whole I do not know that the ſavages were much to blame—we had no buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to invade their territories, and if they had invaded England, we ſhould have done the ſame by them.—My life was ſpared, becauſe, having gained ſome little ſtrength in my hand, during the voyage, I pleaſed their king, when I arrived there, with playing on my violin.</p>
                           <p>They ſpared my child too, in pity to my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, when they were going to put him to death.—Now, dear brother, before I ſay any more concerning my child to you, I will firſt aſk your pardon for any offence I may have ever given you in all the time we lived ſo long toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:030623_0031_0FE83BA5142B44E0"/>
—I know you have often found fault with me, and I dare ſay I have been to blame very often; but I here ſolemnly declare that I never did any thing purpoſely to offend you, but moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all I could to oblige you—and I can ſafely declare, that I never bore you above a quarter of an hour's reſentment, for any thing you might ſay to me which I thought harſh.</p>
                           <p>Now, dear William, after being in this iſland eleven years, the weakneſs in my hand has unfortunately returned, and yet there being no appearance of complaint, the uninformed iſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders think it is all my obſtinacy, and that I <hi>will not</hi> entertain them with my muſic, which makes me ſay that I <hi>cannot;</hi> and they have impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, and threaten to put my ſon to death if I perſiſt in my ſtubbornneſs any longer.</p>
                           <p>The anguiſh I feel in my mind takes away all hope of the recovery of ſtrength in my hand, and I have no doubt but that they intend in a few days to put their horrid threat into execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                           <p>Therefore, dear brother William, hearing from my priſon of a moſt uncommon circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which is, that an Engliſh veſſel is lying at a ſmall diſtance from the iſland, I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted a faithful negro to take my child to the ſhip, and deliver him to the captain, with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:030623_0032_0FE83BA699CF50A8"/>
that he may be ſent (with this letter) to you, on the ſhip's arrival in England.</p>
                           <p>Now my dear dear brother William, in caſe the poor boy ſhould live to come to you, I have no doubt but you will receive him; yet, excuſe a poor fond father, if I ſay a word or two that I hope may prove in his favour.</p>
                           <p>Pray, my dear brother, do not think it the child's fault, but mine, that you will find him ſo ignorant—he has always ſhown a quickneſs and a willingneſs to learn, and would, I dare ſay, if he had been brought up under your care, have been by this time a Greek ſcholar—but you know I am no ſcholar myſelf. Beſides, not having any books here, I have only been able to teach my child by talking to him; and in all my converſations with him I have never taken much pains to inſtruct him in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of my own country; thinking, that if ever he went over, he would learn them ſoon enough; and if he never <hi>did</hi> go over, that it would be as well he knew nothing about them.</p>
                           <p>I have kept him alſo from the knowledge of every thing which I have thought pernicious in the conduct of the ſavages, except now and then pointing out a few of their faults, in order to give him a true conception and a proper diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſte of them. At the ſame time I have taught
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:030623_0033_0FE83BAD5A6DF5F0"/>
him to love, and to do good to his neighbour, whoever that neighbour might be, and whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver might be his failings. Falſehood of every kind I included in this precept as forbidden; for no one can love his neighbour and deceive him.</p>
                           <p>I have inſtructed him too, to hold in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt all frivolous vanity, and all kinds of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences which he was never likely to obtain. He has learnt all I have undertaken to teach him, but I am afraid you will yet think he has learnt too little.</p>
                           <p>Your wife, I fear, will be offended at his want of politeneſs, and perhaps want of proper reſpect for a perſon of her rank; but indeed he is very tractable, and can, without ſeverity; be cured of all his faults; and though you will find he has many, yet, pray my dear brother, pray my dear brother William, call to mind he has been a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and affectionate child to me; and that, had it pleaſed heaven we had lived together for many years to come, I verily believe, that I ſhould never have experienced one mark of his diſobedience.</p>
                           <p>Farewel for ever, my dear dear brother William—and if my poor, kind, affectionate child ſhould live to bring you this letter, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſpeak to him of me; and let him know, that for twelve years he was my ſole comfort;
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:030623_0034_0FE83BAEE1061DE8"/>
and that, when I ſent him from me, in order to ſave his life, I laid down my head upon the floor of the cell in which I was confined, and prayed that heaven might end my days before the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                           <p>This was the concluſion of the letter, except four or five lines which (with his name) were ſo much blotted, apparently with tears, that they were illegible.</p>

                     <p>WHILE the dean was reading to himſelf this letter, his countenance frequently changed, and once or twice the tears ſtreamed from his eyes. When it was finiſhed, he exclaimed,</p>
                     <p>"My brother has ſent his child to me, and I will be a parent to him." He was going to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the door when Lady Clementina ſtopped him.</p>
                     <p>"Is it proper, do you think, dean, that all the ſervants in the houſe ſhould be witneſſes to your meeting with your brother and your ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew in the ſtate in which they muſt be at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent?—ſend for them into a private apartment."</p>
                     <p>"My brother!" (cried the dean) "Oh that it <hi>were</hi> my brother! The man is merely a perſon from the ſhip, who has conducted his child hither."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="35" facs="unknown:030623_0035_0FE83BB657087818"/>
The bell was rung, money was ſent to the man, and orders given that the boy ſhould be ſhown up immediately.</p>
                     <p>While young Henry was walking up the ſtairs, the dean's wife was weighing in her mind, in what manner it would moſt redound to her honour to receive him; for her vanity taught her to believe that the whole inquiſitive world pried into her conduct even upon every family occurrence.</p>
                     <p>Young William was wondering to himſelf what kind of an unpoliſhed monſter his beggar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly couſin would appear; and was contemplat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, "how much the poor youth would be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed and awed by his ſuperiority."</p>
                     <p>The dean felt no other ſenſation than an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient deſire of beholding the child.</p>
                     <p>The door opened—and the ſon of his brother Henry, of his benefactor, entered.</p>
                     <p>The habit he had on when he left his father, being worn out by the length of the voyage, he was in the dreſs of a ſailor-boy. Though about the ſame age with his couſin, he was ſomething taller: and though a ſtrong family reſemblance appeared between the two youths, he was hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomer than William; and from a ſimplicity ſpread over his countenance, a quick impatience in his eye, which denoted anxious curioſity,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:030623_0036_0FE83BB7DD1DA0E8"/>
and childiſh ſurpriſe at every new object which preſented itſelf, he appeared younger than his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and well-bred couſin.</p>
                     <p>He walked into the room, not with a dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed obeiſance, but with a hurrying ſtep, a half pleaſed, yet a half frightened look, an inſtanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous ſurvey of every perſon preſent; not as demanding "what they thought of him," but expreſſing, almoſt as plainly as in direct words, "what he thought of them." For all alarm in reſpect to his ſafety and reception ſeemed now wholly forgotten in the curioſity which the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſight of ſtrangers, ſuch as he had never ſeen in his life before, excited. And as to <hi>himſelf,</hi> he did not appear to know there was ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon exiſting: his whole faculties were abſorbed in <hi>others.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The dean's reception of him did honour to his ſenſibility; and his gratitude to his brother. After the firſt affectionate gaze, he ran to him, took him in his arms, ſat down, drew him to him, held him between his knees, and repeated<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly exclaimed, "I will repay to you, all I owe to your father."</p>
                     <p>The boy, in return, hugged the dean round the neck, kiſſed him, and cried,</p>
                     <p>"Oh, you <hi>are</hi> my father—you have juſt ſuch eyes, and ſuch a forehead—indeed you would be
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:030623_0037_0FE83BBE995C8208"/>
almoſt the ſame as he, if it were not for that great white thing which grows upon your head!"</p>
                     <p>Let the reader underſtand, that the dean, fondly attached to every ornament of his digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied function, was never ſeen (unleſs caught in bed) without an enormous wig—with this, young Henry was enormouſly ſtruck; having never ſeen ſo unbecoming a decoration, either in the ſavage iſland from whence he came, or on board of the veſſel in which he ſailed.</p>
                     <p>"Do you imagine" (cried his uncle, laying his hand gently on the reverend habiliment) "that this grows?"</p>
                     <p>"What is on <hi>my</hi> head grows," ſaid young Henry, "and ſo does what is upon my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's."</p>
                     <p>"But now you are come to Europe, you will ſee many perſons with ſuch things as theſe, which they put on and take off."</p>
                     <p>"Why do you wear ſuch things?"</p>
                     <p>"As a diſtinction between us and inferior people: they are worn to give an importance to the wearer."</p>
                     <p>"That is juſt as the ſavages do; they ſtick braſs nails, wire, buttons, and entrails of beaſts all over them to give them importance."</p>
                     <p>The dean now led his nephew to Lady Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentina,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:030623_0038_0FE83BC0220CEB40"/>
and told him "That was his aunt, to whom he muſt behave with the utmoſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect."</p>
                     <p>"I will, I will," he replied, "for ſhe, I ſee, is a perſon of importance too—ſhe has, very near, ſuch a white thing upon her head as you have!"</p>
                     <p>His aunt had not yet fixed, in what manner it was beſt to behave; whether with intimidat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grandeur, or with amiable tenderneſs. While ſhe was heſitating between the two, ſhe felt a kind of jealous apprehenſion that her ſon was not ſo engaging either in his perſon or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs as his couſin; and therefore ſhe ſaid,</p>
                     <p>"I hope, dean, the arrival of this child will give you a ſtill higher ſenſe of the happineſs we enjoy in our own—what an inſtructive contraſt between the manners of the one, and of the other!"</p>
                     <p>"It is not the child's fault," returned the dean, "that he is not ſo elegant in his manners as his couſin;—had William been bred in the ſame place, he would have been as unpoliſhed as this boy."</p>
                     <p>"I beg your pardon, ſir" (ſaid young Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam with a formal bow and a ſarcaſtic ſmile) "for I aſſure you that ſeveral of my tutors have told me, that I appear to know many things by inſtinct."</p>

                        <pb n="39" facs="unknown:030623_0039_0FE83BC6C4303C30"/>
Young Henry fixed his eyes upon his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin while with ſteady ſelf-complacency he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered this ſpeech; and no ſooner was it conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded than Henry cried out in a kind of wonder,</p>
                     <p>"A little man! as I am alive, a little man! I did not know there were ſuch little men in this country! I never ſaw one in my life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore!"</p>
                     <p>"This is a boy," ſaid the dean, "a boy not older than yourſelf."</p>
                     <p>He put their hands together, and William gravely ſhook hands with his couſin.</p>
                     <p>"It <hi>is</hi> a man," continued young Henry—then ſtroked his couſin's chin. "No no, I do not know whether it is or not."</p>
                     <p>"I tell you again," ſaid the dean, "he is a boy of your own age—you and he are couſins, for I am his father."</p>
                     <p>"How can that be?" ſaid young Henry, "he called you <hi>Sir.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>"In this country," ſaid the dean, "polite children do not call their parents <hi>father</hi> and <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>"Then don't they ſometimes forget to love them as ſuch?" aſked Henry.</p>
                     <p>His uncle became now impatient to interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate him in every particular, concerning his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's ſtate—Lady Clementina felt equal impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:030623_0040_0FE83BC84A7811A8"/>
to know where the father was; whether he was coming to live with them, wanted any thing of them, and every circumſtance in which her vanity was intereſted. Explanations fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed all theſe queſtions; but which, merely agreeing with what the elder Henry's letter has related, require no recital here.</p>

                     <p>THAT vanity which preſided over every thought and deed of Lady Clementina's, was the protector of young Henry within her houſe: it repreſented to her "how amiable her conduct would appear in the eye of the world, ſhould ſhe condeſcend to treat this deſtitute nephew as her own ſon:" it repreſented to her "the envy ſuch heroic virtue would excite in the hearts of her particular friends, and what grief in the boſom of all thoſe who did not like her."</p>
                     <p>The dean was a man of acute penetration; he underſtood the thoughts which upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion paſſed in the mind of his wife; and in order to inſure her kind treatment of the boy, inſtead of reproaching her for the cold manner in which ſhe had at firſt received him, he praiſed her tender and ſympathetic heart for having ſhown him ſo much kindneſs: and thus ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated her vanity to be praiſed ſtill more.</p>

William, the mother's own ſon, far from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending a rival in this ſavage boy, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of his own pre-eminence, and felt an affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for him; though rather as a foil than as a couſin. He ſported with his ignorance upon all occaſions, and even lay in wait for circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that might expoſe it; while young Henry, ſtrongly impreſſed with every thing that appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed new to him, expreſſed, without reſerve, the ſenſations which thoſe novelties excited; and felt little care what conſtruction was put upon his obſervations.</p>
                     <p>He never appeared offended or abaſhed when laughed at, but ſtill purſued his queſtions, and ſtill diſcovered his wonder at many replies made to him, though "ſimpleton," "poor ſilly boy," and "ideot," were vociferated around him from his couſin, his aunt, and their conſtant viſitor the biſhop.</p>
                     <p>His uncle would frequently undertake to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct him; ſo indeed would the biſhop; but Lady Clementina, her ſon, and the greateſt part of her companions, found ſomething ſo irreſiſtibly ridiculous in his remarks, that nothing but immoderate laughter followed: they thought ſuch folly had even merit in the way of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, and they wiſhed him no wiſer.</p>
                     <p>Having been told, that every morning on firſt
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:030623_0042_0FE83BD08E570540"/>
ſeeing his uncle, he was to make a reſpectful bow, and coming into the dean's dreſſing room juſt as he was out of bed, his wig lying on the table, Henry appeared at a loſs which of the two he ſhould bow to—at laſt he gave the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his uncle; but afterwards bowed reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently to the wig. In this, he did what he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived was proper, from the introduction which the dean, on his firſt arrival, had given him to this venerable ſtranger; for in reality, Henry had a contempt for all finery; and had called even his aunt's jewels, when they were firſt ſhown to him, "trumpery," aſking, "what they were good for?" But being corrected in this diſreſpect, and informed of their high va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, he, like a good convert, gave up his reaſon to his faith: and becoming, like all converts, over zealous, he now believed there was great worth in glittering appearances, and reſpected the ear-rings of Lady Clementina almoſt as much as he reſpected her.</p>

                     <p>IT was to be lamented, that when young Henry had been ſeveral months in England, had been taught to read, and had of courſe, in the ſociety in which he lived, ſeen much of the

enlightened world, yet the natural expectation of his improvement was by no means anſwered.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding the ſenſibility which upon various occaſions he manifeſted in the moſt cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivating degree, notwithſtanding the ſeeming gentleneſs of his nature upon all occaſions, there now appeared in moſt of his enquiries and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, a ſomething which demonſtrated either a ſtupid, or troubleſome diſpoſition; either dull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of conception, or an obſtinacy of perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in comments and in arguments that were glaringly falſe.</p>
                     <p>Obſerving his uncle one day offended with his coachman, and hearing him ſay to him in a very angry tone, "You ſhall never drive me again"—</p>
                     <p>The moment the man quitted the room, Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (with his eyes fixed in the deepeſt contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation) repeated five or ſix times in a half whiſper to himſelf,</p>
                     <p>"You ſhall never drive me again. You ſhall never drive me again."</p>
                     <p>The dean at laſt aſked, "what he meant by thus repeating his words?"</p>
                     <p>"I am trying to find out what <hi>you</hi> meant," ſaid Henry.</p>
                     <p>"What! do not you know," cried his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened couſin, "Richard is turned away—
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:030623_0044_0FE83BD90051A658"/>
he is never to get upon our coach-box again; never to drive any of us any more."</p>
                     <p>"And was it pleaſure to drive us, couſin?—I am ſure I have often pitied him—it rained ſometimes very hard when he was on the box—and ſometimes Lady Clementina has kept him a whole hour at the door all in the cold and ſnow—was that pleaſure?"</p>
                     <p>"No," replied young William.</p>
                     <p>"Was it honour, couſin?"</p>
                     <p>"No," exclaimed his couſin with a contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſmile.</p>
                     <p>"Then why did my uncle ſay to him as a puniſhment "he ſhould never"—</p>
                     <p>"Come hither, child," ſaid the dean, "and let me inſtruct you—your father's negligence has been inexcuſable—There are in ſociety," continued the dean, "rich and poor; the poor are born to ſerve the rich."</p>
                     <p>"And what are the rich born for?"</p>
                     <p>"To be ſerved by the poor."</p>
                     <p>"But ſuppoſe the poor would not ſerve them?"</p>
                     <p>"Then they muſt ſtarve.</p>
                     <p>"And ſo poor people are permitted to live, only upon condition that they wait upon the rich?"</p>
                     <p>"Is that a hard condition?—or if it were,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:030623_0045_0FE83BE012C47568"/>
they will be rewarded in a better world than this."</p>
                     <p>"Is there a better world than this?"</p>
                     <p>"Is it poſſible you do not know there is?"</p>
                     <p>"I heard my father once ſay ſomething about a world to come; but he ſtopt ſhort, and ſaid I was too young to underſtand what he meant."</p>
                     <p>"The world to come," returned the dean, "is where we ſhall go after death; and there no diſtinction will be made between rich and poor—all perſons there will be equal."</p>
                     <p>"Aye, now I ſee what makes it a better world than this. But cannot this world try to be as good as that?"</p>
                     <p>"In reſpect to placing all perſons on a level, it is utterly impoſſible—God has ordained it otherwiſe."</p>
                     <p>"How! has Good ordained a diſtinction to be made, and will not make any himſelf?"</p>
                     <p>The dean did not proceed in his inſtructions; he now began to think his brother in the right, and that the boy was too young, or too weak, to comprehend the ſubject.</p>

miſconception and miſapplication of many <hi>words</hi>—his father having had but few opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of diſcourſing with him upon account of his attendance at the court of the ſavages; and not having books in the iſland, he had conſequently many words to learn of this country's language when he arrived in England; this taſk his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive memory made eaſy to him; but his child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh inattention to their proper ſignification ſtill made his want of education conſpicuous.</p>
                     <p>He would call <hi>compliments, lies—Reſerve,</hi> he would call <hi>pride—ſtatelineſs, affectation</hi>—and for the monoſyllable <hi>war,</hi> he conſtantly ſubſtituted the word <hi>maſſacre.</hi>

                     <p>"Sir," ſaid William, to his father one mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as he entered the room, "do you hear how the cannons are firing, and the bells ringing?"</p>
                     <p>"Then I dare ſay," cried Henry, "there has been another maſſacre."</p>
                     <p>The dean called to him in anger, "Will you never learn the right uſe of words? You mean to ſay a battle."</p>
                     <p>"Then what is a maſſacre?" cried the frightened, but ſtill curious Henry.</p>
                     <p>"A maſſacre," replied his uncle, "is when a number of people are ſlain—"</p>
                     <p>"I thought," returned Henry, "ſoldiers had been people!"</p>

"You interrupt me," ſaid the dean, "before I finiſhed my ſentence—certainly, both ſoldiers and ſailors are people, but they engage to die by their own free will and conſent."</p>
                     <p>"What I all of them?"</p>
                     <p>"Moſt of them."</p>
                     <p>"But the reſt are maſſacred?"</p>
                     <p>The dean anſwered, "The number that go to battle unwillingly, and by force, are few; and for the others they have previouſly ſold their lives to the ſtate."</p>
                     <p>"For what?"</p>
                     <p>"For ſoldiers' pay and ſailors' pay."</p>
                     <p>"My father uſed to tell me we muſt not take away our own lives; but he forgot to tell me, we might ſell them for others to take away."</p>
                     <p>"William," (ſaid the dean to his ſon, his patience tired with his nephew's perſevering nonſenſe) "explain to your couſin the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between a battle and a maſſacre."</p>
                     <p>"A maſſacre," ſaid William, riſing from his ſeat, and fixing his eyes alternately upon his father, his mother, and the biſhop (all of whom were preſent) for their approbation, rather than the perſon's to whom his inſtructions were to be addreſſed—"a maſſacre," ſaid William, "is

when human beings are ſlain, who have it not in their power to defend themſelves."</p>
                     <p>"Dear couſin William," (ſaid Henry) "that muſt ever be the caſe, with every one who is killed."</p>
                     <p>After a ſhort heſitation, William replied, "In maſſacres people are put to death for no crime, but merely becauſe they are objects of ſuſpicion."</p>
                     <p>"But in battle," ſaid Henry, "the perſons put to death, are not even ſuſpected."</p>
                     <p>The biſhop now condeſcended to end this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation by ſaying emphatically,</p>
                     <p>"Conſider, young ſavage, that in battle nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the infant, the aged, the ſick or infirm are involved, but only thoſe in the full prime of health and vigour."</p>
                     <p>As this argument came from ſo great and reverend a man as the biſhop, Henry was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, by a frown from his uncle, to ſubmit, as one refuted; although he had an anſwer at the verieſt tip of his tongue, which it was torture to him not to utter. What he wiſhed to ſay muſt ever remain a ſecret.—The church has its terrors as well as the law, and Henry was awed by the dean's tremendous wig, as much as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-noſter Row is awed by the attorney-general.</p>

                     <p>IF the dean had loved his wife but moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeeing all her faults clearly as he did, he muſt frequently have quarrelled with her: if he had loved her with tenderneſs, he muſt have treated her with a degree of violence in the hope of amending her failings: but having neither perſonal, nor mental affection towards her ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently intereſting to give himſelf the trouble to contradict her will in any thing, he paſſed for one of the beſt huſbands in the world.—Lady Clementina went out when ſhe liked, ſtaid at home when ſhe liked, dreſſed as ſhe liked, and talked as ſhe liked, without a word of diſapprobation from her huſband, and all—becauſe he cared nothing about her.</p>
                     <p>Her vanity attributed this indulgence to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate affection: and obſervers in general thought her happier in her marriage, than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"And muſt my name be bandied about by lawyers in a common court of juſtice?" cried Lady Clementina: "How ſhocking to my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy!"</p>
                     <p>"My lord, it is a pity we cannot try them by the eccleſiaſtical court," ſaid the dean, with a ſigh!</p>
                     <p>"Nor by the India delinquent bill," ſaid the biſhop with vexation.</p>
                     <p>"So totally innocent as I am!" ſhe vocife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with ſobs: "Every one knows I never touch a card at home, and this libel charges me with playing at my own houſe—and though, whenever I do play, I own I am apt to win, yet it is merely for my amuſement."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="55" facs="unknown:030623_0055_0FE83C0A603091F0"/>
"Win or not win, play or not play," ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed both the church-men, "this is a libel: no doubt, no doubt, a libel."</p>
                     <p>Poor Henry's confined knowledge of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive language tormented him ſo much with cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity upon this occaſion, that he went ſoftly up to his uncle, and aſked him in a whiſper, "What was the meaning of the word libel?"</p>
                     <p>"A libel," replied the dean, in a raiſed voice, "is that, which one perſon publiſhes to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury of another."</p>
                     <p>"And what can the injured perſon do," aſked Henry, "if the accuſation ſhould chance to be true?"</p>
                     <p>"Proſecute," replied the dean.</p>
                     <p>"But then what does he do if the accuſation is falſe?"</p>
                     <p>"Proſecute likewiſe," anſwered the dean.</p>
                     <p>"How, uncle! is it poſſible that the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent behave juſt like the guilty?"</p>
                     <p>"There is no other way to act."</p>
                     <p>"Why then, if I was the innocent, I would do nothing at all, ſooner than I would act like the guilty. I would not perſecute—"</p>
                     <p>"I ſaid <hi>proſecute,</hi>" cried the dean in anger: "Leave the room, you have no comprehenſion."</p>
                     <p>"Oh yes, now I underſtand the difference of the two words—but they ſound ſo alike I
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:030623_0056_0FE83C0BE6745088"/>
did not obſerve the diſtinction at firſt. You ſaid, "the innocent <hi>proſecute,</hi> but the guilty <hi>perſecute.</hi>" He bowed (convinced as he thought) and left the room.</p>
                     <p>"After this modern ſtar-chamber, which was left ſitting, had agreed on its mode of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, and the writer of the libel was made acquainted with his danger, he waited, in all humility, upon Lady Clementina, and aſſured her, with every appearance of ſincerity—</p>
                     <p>"That ſhe was not the perſon alluded to by the paragraph in queſtion, but that the initials which ſhe had conceived to mark out her name, were, in fact, meant to point out Lady Catha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine Newland.</p>
                     <p>"But, Sir," cried Lady Clementina, "what could induce you to write ſuch a paragraph upon Lady Catharine? She <hi>never</hi> plays."</p>
                     <p>"We know that, madam, or we dared not to have attacked her. Though we muſt circulate libels, madam, to gratify our numerous readers, yet no people are more in fear of proſecutions than authors and editors; therefore, unleſs we are deceived in our information, we always take care to libel the innocent—we apprehend nothing from them—their own characters ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them—but the guilty are very tenacious; and what they cannot ſecure by fair means, they

                     <p>ABOUT this period the dean had juſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a pamphlet in his own name, and in which that of his friend the biſhop was only mentioned with thanks for hints, obſervations, and condeſcending encouragement to the author.</p>
                     <p>This pamphlet glowed with the dean's love for his country; and ſuch a country as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, it was impoſſible <hi>not</hi> to love. "Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious air, fertile fields, wood, water, corn, graſs, ſheep, oxen, fiſh, fowl, fruit, and vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles," were diſperſed with the moſt prodigal hand—"valient men; pretty women; ſtateſmen wiſe and juſt; tradeſmen abounding in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>, huſbandmen poſſeſſing peace, eaſe, plenty: and all ranks, liberty,"—This brilliant deſcription, while the dean read the work to his family, ſo charmed poor Henry that he repeatedly cried out,</p>
                     <p>"I am glad I came to this country."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="58" facs="unknown:030623_0058_0FE83C144842FD80"/>
But it ſo happened, that a few days after, Lady Clementina, in order to render the delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of her taſte admired, could eat of no one diſh upon the table, but found fault with them all. The dean at length ſaid to her,</p>
                     <p>"Indeed you are too nice—reflect upon the hundreds of poor creatures who have not a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, or a drop of any thing to ſubſiſt upon, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept bread and water; and even of the firſt a ſcanty allowance, but for which they are oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to toil ſix days in the week, from ſun to ſun."</p>
                     <p>"Pray, uncle," cried Henry, "in what country do theſe poor people live?"</p>
                     <p>"In this country," replied the dean.</p>
                     <p>Henry roſe from his chair, ran to the chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-piece, took up his uncle's pamphlet, and ſaid, "I don't remember your mentioning them here."</p>
                     <p>"Perhaps I have not," anſwered the dean coolly.</p>
                     <p>Still Henry turned over each leaf of the book, but could meet only with luxurious details of "the fruits of the earth, the beaſts of the field, the birds of the air, and the fiſhes of the ſea."</p>
                     <p>"Why here is proviſion enough for all the people," ſaid Henry: "why ſhould they want? why do not they go and take ſome of theſe things?"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="59" facs="unknown:030623_0059_0FE83C1B327501E8"/>
"They muſt not," ſaid the dean, "unleſs they were their own."</p>
                     <p>"What! uncle, does no part of the earth, nor any thing which the earth produces, belong to the poor?"</p>
                     <p>"Certainly not."</p>
                     <p>"Why did not you ſay ſo then in your pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet?"</p>
                     <p>"Becauſe it is what every body knows."</p>
                     <p>"Oh, then, what you have ſaid in your pamphlet, is only what—nobody knows."</p>
                     <p>There appeared to the dean, in the delivery of this ſentence, a ſatirical acrimony, which his irritability as an author could but ill forgive.</p>
                     <p>An author, it is ſaid, has more acute feelings in reſpect to his works, than any artiſt in the world beſides.</p>
                     <p>Henry had ſome cauſe, on the preſent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to think this obſervation juſt; for no ſooner had he ſpoken the foregoing words, than his uncle took him by the hand out of the room; and leading him to his ſtudy, there he enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated his various faults, and having told him "it was for all thoſe, too long permitted with impunity, and not merely for the <hi>preſent</hi> imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence that he meant to puniſh him," ordered him to cloſe confinement in his chamber for a week.</p>

In the mean time the dean's pamphlet (leſs hurt by Henry's critique than <hi>he</hi> had been) was proceeding to the tenth edition, and the author acquiring literary reputation beyond what he had ever conferred on his friend the biſhop.</p>
                     <p>The ſtile, the energy, the eloquence of the work, was echoed by every reader who could afford to buy it—ſome few enlightened ones ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, who chiefly admired the author's <hi>inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

                     <p>THE dean, in the good humour which the rapid ſale of his book produced, once more took his nephew to his boſom; and although the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of young Henry, upon the late occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, had offended him very highly, yet that ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame ignorance, evinced a ſhort time after upon a different ſubject, ſtruck his uncle, as produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of a moſt rare and exalted virtue.</p>
                     <p>Henry had frequently in his converſation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed the total want of all knowledge in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to religion or futurity; and the dean for this reaſon delayed taking him to church, till he had previouſly given him inſtructions <hi>wherefore</hi> he went.</p>
                     <p>A leiſure morning arrived on which he took his nephew to his ſtudy, and implanted in his

youthful mind, the firſt unconfuſed idea of the Creator of the univerſe!</p>
                     <p>The dean was eloquent; Henry was all at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention: his underſtanding, expanded by time, to the conception of a God—and not warped by cuſtom, from the ſenſations which a juſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that God inſpires, dwelt with delight and wonder on the information given him!—leſſons, which inſtilled into the head of a ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs infant, too often produce throughout his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining life, an impious indifference to the truths revealed.</p>
                     <p>Yet, with all that aſtoniſhed, that reſpectful ſenſibility which Henry ſhowed on this great occaſion; he ſtill expreſſed his opinion, and put queſtions to the dean with his uſual ſimplicity, till he felt himſelf convinced.</p>
                     <p>"What!" cried he—after being informed of the attributes inſeparable from the Supreme Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and having received the injunction to offer prayers to him night and morning, "What! am I permitted to ſpeak to power divine?"</p>
                     <p>"At all times," replied the dean.</p>
                     <p>"What! whenever I like?"</p>
                     <p>"Whenever you like," returned the dean.</p>
                     <p>"I durſt not," cried Henry, "make ſo free with the biſhop: nor dare any of his attendants."</p>
                     <p>"The biſhop," ſaid the dean, "is the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant

of God, and therefore muſt be treated with reſpect."</p>
                     <p>"With more reſpect than his maſter?" aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Henry.</p>
                     <p>The dean not replying immediately to this queſtion, Henry in the rapidity of enquiry ran to another: "But what am I to ſay when I ſpeak to the Almighty?"</p>
                     <p>"Firſt, thank him for the favours he has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on you."</p>
                     <p>"What favours?"</p>
                     <p>"You amaze me," cried the dean, "by your queſtion! Do not you live in eaſe, in plenty, and happineſs?"</p>
                     <p>"And do the poor and the unhappy thank him too, uncle?"</p>
                     <p>No doubt—every human being glorifies him, for having been made a rational creature."</p>
                     <p>"And does my aunt and all her card parties glorify him for that?"</p>
                     <p>The dean again made no reply—and Henry went on to other queſtions, till his uncle had ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtructed him as to the nature and the form of <hi>prayer</hi>—and now putting into his hands a book, he pointed out to him a few ſhort prayers which he wiſhed him to addreſs to heaven in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt Henry bent his knees, as his uncle
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:030623_0063_0FE83C2C56B0EDF0"/>
had directed, he trembled—he turned pale—and held for a ſlight ſupport, on the chair placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</p>
                     <p>His uncle went to him and aſked him, "What was the matter?"</p>
                     <p>"Oh!" cried Henry, "when I firſt came to your door with my poor father's letter, I ſhook for fear you would not look upon me—and I cannot help feeling even more now than I did then."</p>
                     <p>The dean embraced him with warmth—gave him confidence—and retired to the other ſide of the ſtudy to obſerve his whole demeanour on this new occaſion.</p>
                     <p>As he beheld his features varying between the paſſions of humble fear, and fervent hope—his face ſometimes glowing with the rapture of thankſgiving, and ſometimes with the bluſhes of contrition, he thus exclaimed apart:</p>
                     <p>"This is the true education on which to found the principles of religion—The favour conferred by heaven in granting the freedom of petitions to its throne, can never be conceived with proper force, but by thoſe, whoſe moſt tedious moments during their infancy, were <hi>not</hi> paſſed in prayer. Unthinking governors of childhood! to inſult the Deity with a form of worſhip, in which the mind has no ſhare; nay

worſe, has repugnance; and by the thoughtleſs habits of youth, prevent, even in age, devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion."</p>
                     <p>Henry's attention was ſo firmly fixed, that he forgot there was a ſpectator of his fervour; nor did he hear young William enter the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and even ſpeak to his father.</p>
                     <p>At length cloſing his book, and riſing from his knees, he approached his uncle and couſin with a ſedateneſs in his air, which gave the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a very falſe opinion of the ſtate of his youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful companion's mind.</p>
                     <p>"So, Mr. Henry," cried William, "you have been obliged to ſay your prayers at laſt."</p>
                     <p>The dean informed his ſon, "That to Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it was no puniſhment to pray."</p>
                     <p>"He is the ſtrangeſt boy I ever know," ſaid William inadvertently.</p>
                     <p>"To be ſure," ſaid Henry, "I was fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened when I firſt knelt; but when I came to the words <hi>Father which art in heaven,</hi> they gave me courage; for I know how merciful and kind a <hi>father</hi> is, beyond any one elſe."</p>
                     <p>The dean again embraced his nephew; let fall a tear to his poor brother Henry's misfortues; and admoniſhed the youth to ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf equally ſubmiſſive to other inſtructions, as he had done to thoſe, which inculcate piety.</p>

                     <p>THE interim between youth and manhood was paſſed by young William and young Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in ſtudious application to literature; ſome caſual miſtakes in our cuſtoms and manners on the part of Henry, ſome too cloſe adherences to them on the ſide of William.</p>
                     <p>Their different characters when boys, were preſerved when they were men: Henry ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that natural ſimplicity which his early deſtiny had given him; he wondered ſtill at ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things he ſaw and heard, and at times would venture to give his opinion, contradict, and even act in oppoſition to perſons, whom long expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and the approbation of the world had pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in ſituations that claimed his implicit reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and ſubmiſſion.</p>
                     <p>Unchanged in all his boyiſh graces, young William, now a man, was never known to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe upon the ſtatutes of good-breeding, even though ſincerity, his own free will, duty to his neighbour, with many other plebeian virtues and privileges, were the ſacrifice.</p>
                     <p>William inherited all the pride and ambition of the dean—Henry, all his father's humility.—And yet (ſo various and extenſive is the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the word pride, that) on ſome occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Henry was proud even beyond his couſin.
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:030623_0066_0FE83C36945DD248"/>
He thought it far beneath his dignity, ever to honour or contemplate with awe, any human being in whom he ſaw numerous failings. Nor would he, to ingratiate himſelf into the favour of a man above him, ſtoop to one ſervility, ſuch as the haughty William daily practiſed.</p>
                     <p>"I know I am called proud," one day ſaid William to Henry.</p>
                     <p>"Dear couſin," replied Henry, "it muſt be only then, by thoſe who do not know you: for to me you appear the humbleſt creature in the world."</p>
                     <p>"Do you really think ſo?"</p>
                     <p>"I am certain of it; or would you always give up your opinion to that of perſons in a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior ſtate, however inferior in their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding? Would, elſe, their weak judgment immediately change yours, though, before, you had been decided on the oppoſite ſide? Now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, couſin, I have more pride than you, for I never will ſtoop to act or to ſpeak contrary to my feelings."</p>
                     <p>"Then you will never be a great man."</p>
                     <p>"Nor ever deſire it, if I muſt firſt be a mean one."</p>
                     <p>There was in the reputation of theſe two young men another miſtake, which the common retailers of character committed. Henry was
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:030623_0067_0FE83C3D68D717E8"/>
ſaid to be wholly negligent, while William was reputed to be extremely fond, of the other ſex: William indeed was gallant, was amorous, and indulged his inclination to the libertine ſociety of women; but Henry it was who <hi>loved</hi> them. He admired them at a reverential diſtance, and felt ſo tender an affection for the virtuous part, that it ſhocked him to behold, much more to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociate with the depraved and vicious.</p>
                     <p>In the advantages of perſon Henry was ſtill ſuperior to William, and yet the latter had no common ſhare of thoſe attractions which capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate weak, thoughtleſs, or unſkilful minds.</p>

                     <p>ABOUT the time that Henry and Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am quitted college and had arrived at their twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth year, the dean made the purchaſe of a ſmall eſtate in a village near to the country reſidence of Lord and Lady Bendham; and in the total want of ſociety, the dean's family were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently honoured with invitations from the great houſe.</p>
                     <p>Lord Bendham, beſides a good eſtate, poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the office of a lord of the bed-chamber to his majeſty. Hiſtorians do not aſcribe much importance to the ſituation, or to the talents of
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:030623_0068_0FE83C3EF189A400"/>
nobles in this department, nor ſhall this little hiſtory. A lord of the bed-chamber is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage well known in courts, and in all capitals where courts reſide; with this advantage to the enquirer, that in becoming acquainted with one of thoſe noble characters, you become acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with all the remainder; not only with thoſe of the ſame kingdom, but thoſe of foreign na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for, in whatever land, in whatever cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, a lord of the bed-chamber muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be the ſelf-ſame creature: one, wholly made up of obſervance, of obedience, of dependance, and of imitation—a borrowed character—a character formed by reflection.</p>
                     <p>The wife of this illuſtrious peer, as well as himſelf, took her hue, like the chameleon, from ſurrounding objects; her manners were not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by her mind, but were ſolely directed by external circumſtances. At court, humble, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, patient, attentive—At balls, maſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades, gaming-tables, and routs, gay, ſprightly and flippant—At her country ſeat, reſerved, auſtere, arrogant, and gloomy.</p>
                     <p>Though in town her timid eye, in preſence of certain perſons, would ſcarce uplipft its trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling lid, ſo much ſhe felt her own inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cance; yet, in the country, till lady Clementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na arrived, there was not one being of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:030623_0069_0FE83C46227E5E38"/>
enough to ſhare in her acquaintance; and ſhe paid back to her inferiors there, all the humiliating ſlights, and all the mortifications which in London ſhe received from thoſe to whom <hi>ſhe</hi> was inferior.</p>
                     <p>Whether in town or country, it is but juſtice to acknowledge, that in her own perſon ſhe was ſtrictly chaſte; but in the country ſhe extended that chaſtity even to the perſon of others; and the young woman who loſt her virtue in the village of Anfield, had better have loſt her life. Some few were now and then found hanging or drowned, while no other cauſe could be aſſigned for their deſpair, than an imputation on their character, and dread of the harſh purity of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Bendham. She would remind the pariſh prieſt of the puniſhment ordained for female diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, and by her influence had cauſed many an unhappy girl to do public penance in their own or the neighbouring churches.</p>
                     <p>"But this country rigour, in town, ſhe could diſpenſe withal; and like other ladies of virtue, ſhe there viſited and received into her houſe the acknowledged miſtreſſes of a man in elevated life; it was not therefore the crime, but the rank which the criminal held in ſociety, that drew down Lady Bendham's vengeance: ſhe even carried her diſtinction of claſſes in female

error to ſuch a very nice point, that the adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous concubine of an elder brother was her moſt intimate acquaintance, while the leſs guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty unmarried miſtreſs of the younger, ſhe would not fully her lips to exchange a word with.</p>
                     <p>Lord and Lady Bendham's birth, education, talents, and propenſities, being much on the ſame ſcale of eminence, they would have been a very happy pair had not one great misfortune inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened—The lady never bore her lord a child.—While every cottage of the village was cram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with half-ſtarved children, whoſe father from week to week, from year to year, exerted his manly youth and waſted his ſtrength in vain to protect them from hunger; whoſe mother mourned over her new-born infant as a little wretch, ſent into the world to deprive the reſt of what already was too ſcanty for them; in the caſtle that owned every cottage and all the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding land, and where one ſingle day of feaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting would have nouriſhed for a month all the poor inhabitants of the pariſh, not one child was given to partake of the plenty. The curſe of barrenneſs was on the family of the lord of the manor—the curſe of fruitfulneſs upon the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed poor.</p>
                     <p>This lord and lady, with an ample fortune both by inheritance and their ſovereign's favour,
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:030623_0071_0FE83C4EA98B19F0"/>
had never yet the economy to be exempt from debts; ſtill, over their ſplendid, their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe table, they could contrive and plan excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſchemes "how the poor might live moſt comfortably with a little better management."</p>
                     <p>The wages of a labouring man with a wife and half a dozen ſmall children, Lady Bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham thought quite ſufficient if they would only learn a little economy.</p>
                     <p>"You know, my lord, thoſe people never want to dreſs—ſhoes and ſtockings, a coat and waiſtcoat, a gown and a cap, a petticoat and a handkerchief, is all they want—fire, to be ſure, in winter—then all the reſt is merely for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion."</p>
                     <p>"I'll get a pen and ink," ſaid young Henry, (one day when he had the honour of being at their table) "and ſee what the <hi>reſt</hi> amounts to."</p>
                     <p>"No, no accounts," cried my lord, "no ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming up: but if you were to calculate, you muſt add to the receipts of the poor my gift at Chriſtmas, laſt year, during the froſt, no leſs than a hundred pounds,"</p>
                     <p>"How benevolent!" exclaimed the dean.</p>
                     <p>"How prudent!" exclaimed Henry.</p>
                     <p>"What do you mean by prudent?" aſked Lord Bendham. "Explain your meaning."</p>
                     <p>"No, my lord," replied the dean, "do not

aſk for an explanation: this youth is wholly unacquainted with our cuſtoms; and though a man in ſtature, is but a child in intellects. Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry have not I often cautioned you—"</p>
                     <p>"Whatever his thoughts are upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject," cried Lord Bendham, "I deſire to know them."</p>
                     <p>"Why then, my lord," anſwered Henry, "I thought it was prudent in you to give a little; leſt the poor, driven to deſpair, ſhould take all."</p>
                     <p>"And if they had they would have been hanged."</p>
                     <p>"Hanging, my lord, our hiſtory, or ſome tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ſays, was formerly adopted as a mild puniſhment in place of ſtarving."</p>
                     <p>"I am ſure," cried Lady Bendham, (who ſeldom ſpoke directly to the argument before her) "I am ſure they ought to think themſelves much obliged to us."</p>
                     <p>"That is the greateſt hardſhip of all," cried Henry.</p>
                     <p>"What, ſir?" exclaimed the earl.</p>
                     <p>"I beg your pardon—my uncle looks diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed—I am very ignorant—I did not receive my firſt education in this country—and I find I think ſo differently from every one elſe, that I am aſhamed to utter my ſentiments."</p>
                     <p>"Never mind, young man," anſwered Lord
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:030623_0073_0FE83C56E92BCF68"/>
Bendham: "we ſhall excuſe your ignorance for once. Only inform us what it was you juſt now called, <hi>the greateſt hardſhip of all.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>"It was, my lord, that what the poor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to keep them from periſhing, ſhould paſs under the name of <hi>gifts</hi> and <hi>bounty.</hi> Health, ſtrength, and the will to earn a moderate ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, ought to be every man's ſecurity from obligation."</p>
                     <p>"I think a hundred pounds a great deal of money," cried Lady Bendham, "and I hope my lord will never give it again."</p>
                     <p>"And ſo do I," cried Henry, "for if my lord would only be ſo good as to ſpeak a few words for the poor as a ſenator, he might poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly for the future keep his hundred pounds, and yet they never want it."</p>
                     <p>Lord Bendham had the good nature only to ſmile at Henry's ſimplicity, whiſpering to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, "I had rather keep my—" His laſt word was loſt in the whiſper.</p>

                     <p>IN the country—where the ſenſible heart is ſtill more ſuſceptible of impreſſions; and where the unfeeling mind, in the want of other wits to invent, forms ſchemes for its own amuſement—
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:030623_0074_0FE83C586F647A10"/>
our youths both fell in love; if paſſions that were purſued on the moſt oppoſite principles can receive the ſame appellation. William, well verſed in all the licentious theory, thought himſelf in love, becauſe he perceived a tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous impulſe cauſe his heart to beat, while his fancy fixed on a certain object, whoſe preſence agitated yet more his breaſt.</p>
                     <p>Henry thought himſelf not in love, becauſe, while he liſtened to William on the ſubject, he ſound their ſenſations did not in the leaſt agree.</p>
                     <p>William owned to Henry, that he loved Hannah, the daughter of a cottager in the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, and hoped to make her his miſtreſs.</p>
                     <p>Henry felt that his tender regard for Rebecca, the daughter of the curate of the pariſh, did not inſpire him even with the boldneſs to acquaint her with his ſentiments, much leſs to meditate one deſign that might tend to her diſhonour.</p>
                     <p>While William was cautiouſly planning, how to meet in private, and accompliſh the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the object of his paſſion, Henry was endeavouring to fortify the object of <hi>his</hi> choice with every virtue. He never read a book from which he received improvement, that he did not carry it to Rebecca—never knew a circumſtance that might aſſiſt towards her moral inſtruction, that he did not haſte to tell it her—and once, when William boaſted,</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="75" facs="unknown:030623_0075_0FE83C5F6243BE68"/>
"He knew he was beloved by Hannah;"</p>
                     <p>Henry ſaid, with equal triumph, "he had not dared to take the means to learn, nor had Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca dared to give one inſtance of her partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity."</p>
                     <p>Rebecca was the youngeſt, and by far the leaſt handſome daughter of four, to whom the Reverend Mr. Rymer, a widower, was father. The other ſiſters were accounted beauties; and ſhe, from her comparative want of perſonal charms, having been leſs beloved by her parents, and leſs careſſed by thoſe who viſited them than the reſt, had for ſome time paſt ſought other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources of happineſs than the affection, praiſe, and indulgence of her fellow-creatures. She read—but more—ſhe thought. The choiceſt books from her father's little library taught her to think; and reflection faſhioned her mind to bear the ſlights, the mortifications of neglect, with a patient dejection, rather than with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignant or a peeviſh ſpirit.</p>
                     <p>This reſignation to injury and contumely gave to her perfect ſymmetry of perſon, a timid eye, a retiring manner, and ſpread upon her face a placid ſweetneſs, a pale ſerenity mixed with ſenſe and taſte, that no wife connoiſſeur in fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male charms would have exchanged for all the ſparkling eyes and florid tints of her vain and
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:030623_0076_0FE83C60E9008948"/>
vulgar ſiſters.—Henry's ſoul was ſo much ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured of her gentle deportment, that in his ſight ſhe appeared beautiful; while ſhe, with an underſtanding competent to judge of his worth, was ſo greatly ſurpriſed, ſo prodigiouſly aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at the diſtinction, the attention, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny offices of civility paid to her by him in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to her idoliſed ſiſters, that her gratitude for ſuch unexpected favours had ſometimes (even in his preſence, and in that of her family) nearly drowned her eyes with tears. Yet, they were only trifles, in which Henry had the opportunity or the power to give her teſtimony of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard—trifles, often more grateful to the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mind than efforts of high importance; and by which, the artiſt in the human heart will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately trace a paſſion, wholly concealed from the dull eye of the unſkilled obſerver.</p>
                     <p>The firſt cauſe of amazement to Rebecca in the manners of Henry was, that he talked with <hi>her</hi> as well as with her ſiſters; no viſitor elſe had done ſo. In taking a morning's or an even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing's walk, he propoſed <hi>her</hi> going with the reſt; no one had ever required her company before. When he called and ſhe was abſent, he aſked where ſhe was; no one had ever miſſed her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. She thanked him from her very heart, and ſoon perceived that at thoſe times when he
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:030623_0077_0FE83C67E0AB7AC8"/>
was preſent, company was more pleaſing even than books.</p>
                     <p>Her aſtoniſhment, her gratitude, did not ſtop here—Henry proceeded in attention—he ſoon ſelected her from her ſiſters to tell the news of the day when he chanced to call; anſwered her obſervations the firſt; once gave her a ſprig of myrtle from his boſom in preference to another who had praiſed its beauty; and once—never to be forgotten kindneſs—ſheltered her from a haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhower with his <hi>parapluie,</hi> while he lamented to her drenched companions,</p>
                     <p>"That he had but <hi>one</hi> to offer."</p>
                     <p>From a man whoſe ſenſe and perſon they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, how dear, how impreſſive on the female heart is every trait of tenderneſs! Till now, Rebecca had experienced none; not even of the parental kind; and merely from the overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of a kind nature (not in return for affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) had ſhe ever loved her father and her ſiſters. Sometimes, repulſed by their ſeverity, ſhe trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the fullneſs of an affectionate heart upon animals: but now, her alienated mind was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called and ſoftened by a ſenſation that made her long to complain of the burthen it impoſed—thoſe obligations which exact ſilence, are a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy weight to the grateful—Rebecca longed to tell Henry, "that her life would be too little to
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:030623_0078_0FE83C69680A4650"/>
expreſs the full ſenſe ſhe had of the reſpect he paid to her." But as modeſty forbade not only every kind of declaration, but every inſinuation purporting what ſhe felt, ſhe wept through ſleepleſs nights from a load of ſuppreſſed expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; yet ſtill ſhe would not have exchanged this trouble, for all the beauty of her ſiſters.</p>

                     <p>OLD John and Hannah Primroſe, a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent hardy couple, who, by many years of pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar labour and peculiar abſtinence, were the leaſt poor of all the neighbouring cottagers, had an only child called after the mother, Hannah: and this cottage girl was reckoned, in ſpite of the beauty of the elder Miſs Rymers, by far the prettieſt female in the village.</p>

refinement of ſentiment independent of elegant ſociety; honourable pride of heart without dignity of blood; and genius deſtitute of art to render it conſpicuous—<hi>You</hi> will, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, venture to read on; in hopes that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of this ſtory may deſerve your attention; juſt as the wild herb of the foreſt, equally with the cultivated plant in the garden, claims the attention of the botaniſt.</p>
                     <p>When young William ſaw Hannah, he thought her even more beautiful than ſhe was thought by others; and on thoſe days that he he felt no inclination to ride, to ſhoot, or to hunt, he would contrive, by ſome ſecret device, the means to meet with her alone, and give her tokens (if not of his love) at leaſt of his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of her beauty, and of the pleaſure he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed in her company.</p>
                     <p>Hannah liſtened with a kind of delirious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment to all her elevated and eloquent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer uttered; and in return for his praiſes of her charms, and his equivocal replies with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his deſigns towards her, gave to him, her moſt undiſguiſed thoughts, and her whole enraptured heart.</p>
                     <p>This, to her apparently harmleſs, intercourſe had not laſted many weeks before ſhe loved him—ſhe even confeſſed ſhe did, every time that
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:030623_0080_0FE83C7211097728"/>
any unwonted mark of attention from him, ſtruck with unexpected force her infatuated ſenſes.</p>
                     <p>It has been ſaid by a celebrated writer, upon the affection ſubſiſting between the two ſexes, "that there are many perſons who, if they had never heard of the paſſion of love, would never have felt it." Might it not with equal truth he added, that—there are many more, who having heard of it, and believing moſt firmly that they feel it, are nevertheleſs miſtaken? Neither of theſe caſes was the lot of Hannah. She experienced the ſentiment before ſhe ever heard it named in that ſenſe in which ſhe felt it—and ſhe felt it as genuine love alone exiſts—joined with nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous other ſentiments: for love, however ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by many, as the chief paſſion of the human heart, is but a poor dependant, a retainer upon other paſſions; admiration, gratitude, reſpect, eſteem, pride in the object—diveſt the boaſted ſenſation of theſe, and it is no more than the impreſſion of a twelve-month, by courteſy, or vulgar error, termed love.</p>
                     <p>Hannah was formed by the rareſt ſtructure of the human frame, and fated by the tendereſt thrillings of the human ſoul, to inſpire and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience real love—but her nice taſte, her deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate thoughts, were ſo refined beyond the ſphere
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:030623_0081_0FE83C78F6F273B8"/>
of her own ſtation in ſociety, that nature would have produced this prodigy of attraction in vain had not one of ſuperior education and manners aſſailed her heart: and had ſhe been accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the converſation of men in William's rank of life, ſhe had, perhaps, treated William's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes with indifference; but in comparing him with her familiar acquaintance, he was a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle! His unremitted attention ſeemed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion of a ſuperior being, to whom ſhe look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up with reverence, with admiration, with awe, with pride, with ſenſe of obligation—and all thoſe various paſſions which conſtitute true, and <hi>never</hi> to be eradicated, love.</p>
                     <p>But in vain ſhe felt and even avowed with her lips what every look, every geſture, had long denoted; William, with diſcontent, ſometimes with anger, upbraided her for her falſe profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and vowed, "That while one tender proof, which he fervently beſought, was wanting, ſhe did but aggravate his miſery by leſſer endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments."</p>
                     <p>Hannah had been taught the full eſtimation of female virtue; and if her nature could have deteſted one being in a ſtate of wretchedneſs, it would have been the woman who had loſt her honour: yet, for William, what would not Hannah forfeit? The dignity, the peace, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:030623_0082_0FE83C7A822CCEF8"/>
the innocence of her own mind, love ſoon encouraged her to fancy ſhe could eaſily forego—and this ſame overpowering influence at times ſo forcibly poſſeſſed her, that ſhe even felt a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary tranſport in the idea "of ſo precious a ſacrifice to him." But then ſhe loved her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; and their happineſs ſhe could not prevail on herſelf to barter even for <hi>his.</hi> She wiſhed he would demand ſome other pledge of her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; for there was none but this, her ruin in no other ſhape, that ſhe would deny at his requeſt. While thus ſhe deliberated ſhe prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for her fall.</p>
                     <p>Bred up with ſtrict obſervance both to his moral and religious character, William did not dare to tell an unequivocal lie even to his infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors—he never promiſed Hannah he would mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry her; nay even, he paid ſo much reſpect to the forms of truth, that no ſooner was it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that he had obtained her heart, her whole ſoul entire—ſo that loſs of innocence would be leſs terrifying than ſeparation from him—no ſooner did he perceive this, than he candidly told her he "could never make her his wife."—At the ſame time he lamented "the difference of their births, and the duty he owed his parents' hopes," in terms ſo pathetic to her partial ear, that ſhe thought him a greater object of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:030623_0083_0FE83C7F0DA70690"/>
in love, even than herſelf; and was now urged by pity to remove the cauſe of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainings.</p>
                     <p>One evening Henry accidentally paſſed the lonely ſpot where William and ſhe conſtantly met—he obſerved his couſin's impaſſioned eye, and her affectionate, yet fearful glance. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam, he ſaw, took delight in the agitation of mind, in the ſtrong apprehenſion mixed with the love of Hannah; this convinced Henry that either he, or himſelf, was not in love: for his heart told him he would not have beheld ſuch emotions of tenderneſs mingled with ſuch marks of ſorrow, upon the countenance of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca, for the wealth of the univerſe.</p>
                     <p>The firſt time he was alone with William after this, he mentioned his obſervation on Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah's apparent affliction, and aſked "Why her grief was the reſult of thier ſtolen meetings?"</p>
                     <p>"Becauſe," replied William, "her profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are unlimited, while her manners are reſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and I accuſe her of loving me with unkind moderation, while I love her to diſtraction."</p>
                     <p>"You deſign to marry her then?"</p>
                     <p>"How can you degrade me by the ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?"</p>
                     <p>"Would it degrade you more to marry her than to make her your companion? To talk with her for hours in preference to all other

company? To wiſh to be endeared to her by ſtill cloſer ties?"</p>

"He is ſo very good then," ſaid Henry, "that perhaps, ſeeing the dangers to which men in exalted ſtations are expoſed, he has ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme philanthropy, and ſo little ſelf-love, he would rather that himſelf ſhould brave thoſe perils incidental to wealth and grandeur, than any other perſon."</p>
                     <p>"You are not yet civiliſed," ſaid William; "and to argue with you, is but to inſtruct, without gaining inſtruction."</p>

                     <p>THE dean's family paſſed this firſt ſummer at the new purchaſed eſtate ſo pleaſantly, that they left it with regret when winter called them to their houſe in town.</p>
                     <p>But if ſome felt concern on quitting the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage of Anfield, ſome who were left behind felt the deepeſt anguiſh. Thoſe were not the poor; for rigid attention to the morals of people in
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:030623_0087_0FE83C925D47BE28"/>
poverty, and total neglect of their bodily wants, was the dean's practice. He forced them to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend church on every ſabbath; but whether they had a dinner on their return, was too groſs and temporal an enquiry for his ſpiritual fervour. Good of the <hi>ſoul</hi> was all he aimed at; and this pious undertaking, beſides his diligence as a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, required all his exertion as a magiſtrate—for to be very poor and very honeſt, very oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, yet very thankful, is a degree of ſainted ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence not to be attained without the aid of zealous men to frighten into virtue.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe then, who alone felt ſorrow at the dean's departure, were two young women, whoſe parents, exempt from indigence, preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them from ſuffering under his unpitying piety; but whoſe diſcretion had not protected them from the bewitching ſmiles of his nephew, and ſeducing wiles of his ſon.</p>
                     <p>The firſt morning that Rebecca roſe and knew Henry was gone till the following ſummer, ſhe wiſhed ſhe could have lain down again and ſlept away the whole long interval. Her ſiſters' peeviſhneſs, her father's auſterity, ſhe foreſaw would be inſupportable now that ſhe had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Henry's kindneſs, and he was no longer near to fortify her patience. She ſighed—ſhe wept—ſhe was unhappy.</p>
                     <p>But if Rebecca awoke with a dejected mind
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:030623_0088_0FE83C93E128E828"/>
and an aching heart, what were the ſorrows of Hannah? The only child of two doating parents, ſhe never had been taught the neceſſity of reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation—untutored, unread, unuſed to reflect, but knowing how to <hi>feel;</hi> what were her ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings when, on waking, ſhe called to mind that "William was gone," and with him gone all that exceſs of happineſs which his preſence had beſtowed, and for which ſhe had exchanged her future tranquillity.</p>
                     <p>Loſs of tranquillity even Rebecca had to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moan—Hannah had ſtill more—the loſs of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence!</p>
                     <p>Had William remained in the village, ſhame, even conſcience perhaps had ſlept; but ſeparated from her betrayer, parted from the joys of guilt, and left only to its ſorrows, every ſting which quick ſenſibility could ſharpen, was transfixed in her heart to torture her. Firſt came the recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a cold farewell from the man whoſe love ſhe had hoped her yielding paſſion had forever won—next, flaſhed on her thoughts her viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted perſon—next, the crime incurred—next, her cruelty to her tender parents—and laſt of all came the horrors of detection.</p>
                     <p>She knew that as yet, by warineſs, care, and contrivance, her meetings with William had been unſuſpected; but in this agony of mind her fears foreboaded an informer who would
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:030623_0089_0FE83C9AA8FE4EF8"/>
defy all caution; who would ſtigmatiſe her with a name—dear and deſired by every virtuous fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male—abhorrent to the bluſhing harlot—the name of mother.</p>
                     <p>That Hannah, thus impreſſed, could riſe from her bed, meet her parents and her neighbours with her uſual ſmile of vivacity, and voice of mirth, was impoſſible—to leave her bed at all, to creep down ſtairs, and reply in a faint broken voice to queſtions aſked, were, in her ſtate of mind, mighty efforts; and all to which her ſtruggles could attain for many weeks.</p>
                     <p>William had promiſed to write to her while he was away: he kept his word; but not till the end of two months ſhe received a letter.—Fears for his health, apprehenſion of his death during this cruel interval, cauſed an agony of ſuſpenſe that, by repreſenting him to her diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fancy in a ſtate of ſuffering, made him, if poſſible, ſtill dearer to her. In the excrutiating anguiſh of uncertainty, ſhe walked with trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ſteps through all weathers (when ſhe could ſteal half a day while her parents were employed in labour abroad) to the poſt town, at ſix miles diſtance, to enquire for his long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, long wiſhed for letter. When at laſt it was given to her, that moment of conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeemed to repay her for the whole time of agoniſing terror ſhe had endured. "He is alive!" ſhe ſaid, "and I have ſuffered nothing."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="90" facs="unknown:030623_0090_0FE83C9C30436860"/>
She haſtily put this token of his health and his remembrance of her into her boſom, rich as an empreſs with a new-acquired dominion. The way from home, which ſhe had trod with heavy pace, in the fear of renewed diſappointment, ſhe ſkimmed along on her return ſwift as a doe—the cold did not pierce, neither did the rain wet her.—Many a time ſhe put her hand upon the prize ſhe poſſeſſed, to find if it were ſafe—once, on the road, ſhe took it from her boſom, curiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly viewed the ſeal and the direction, then replac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, did not move her fingers from their faſt gripe, till ſhe arrived at home.</p>
                     <p>Her father and her mother were ſtill abſent. She drew a chair, and placing it near to the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly window in the room, ſeated herſelf with ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonious order; and then, gently drew forth her treaſure; laid it on her knee; and with a ſmile that almoſt amounted to a laugh of glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, once more inſpected the outward part, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe would truſt herſelf with the exceſſive joy of looking within.</p>
                     <p>At length the ſeal was broken—but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents ſtill a ſecret. Poor Hannah had learned to write as ſome youths learn Latin; ſo ſhort a time had been allowed for the acquirement, and ſo little expert had been her maſter, that it took her generally a week to write a letter of ten lines, and a month to read one of twenty.
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:030623_0091_0FE83CA36130CF98"/>
But this being a letter on which her mind was deeply engaged, her whole imagination aided her ſlender literature, and at the end of a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night ſhe had made out every word.—They were theſe,</p>

                     <p>To have beheld the illiterate Hannah try for two weeks, day and night, to find out the exact words of this letter, it would have ſtruck the ſpectator with amazement to have underſtood the right, the delicate, the nicely proper ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with which ſhe was affected by every ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence it contained.</p>

ſhe was ſorry at any faults that rendered him leſs worthy of her good opinion.

                     <p>ABSENCE is ſaid to increaſe ſtrong and virtuous love, but to deſtroy that which is weak and ſenſual. In the parallel between young William and young Henry, this was the caſe;
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:030623_0093_0FE83CABB1281B40"/>
for Henry's real love encreaſed, while William's turbulent paſſion declined in ſeparation: yet had the latter not ſo much abated that he did not perceive a ſenſation, like a ſudden ſhock of ſorrow, on a propoſal made him by his father, of entering the marriage ſtate with a young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the dependent niece of Lady Bendham; who, as the dean informed him, had ſignified her lord's and her own approbation of his becoming their nephew.</p>
                     <p>At the firſt moment William received this intimation from his father, his heart revolted with diſguſt from the object, and he inſtantly thought upon Hannah with more affection than he had done for many weeks before. This was from the compariſon between her and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed wife; for he had frequently ſeen Miſs Sedgeley at Lord Bendham's, but had never ſeen in her whole perſon or manners, the leaſt attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to excite his love. He pictured to himſelf an unpleaſant home, with a companion ſo little ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his taſte, and felt a pang of conſcience, as well as of attachment, in the thought of giving up poor Hannah.</p>
                     <p>But theſe reflections, theſe feelings laſted no longer than for the moment: no ſooner had the dean explained why the marriage was deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, recited what great connections, and what great patronage it would confer upon their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:030623_0094_0FE83CAD4BD49468"/>
than William liſtened with eagerneſs, and both his love and his conſcience were, if not wholly quieted, at leaſt for the preſent huſhed.</p>
                     <p>Immediately after the dean had expreſſed to Lord and Lady Bendham his ſon's "ſenſe of the honour and the happineſs conferred on him by their condeſcenſion in admitting him a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their noble family"—Miſs Sedgeley re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from her aunt, nearly the ſame ſhock as William had done from his father. <hi>For ſhe had frequently ſeen the dean's ſon at lord Bendham's, but had never ſeen in his whole perſon or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners the leaſt attraction to excite her love—ſhe pictured to herſelf an unpleaſant home with a companion ſo little ſuited to her taſte:</hi> and at this moment ſhe felt a more than uſual partiality to the dean's nephew, finding the ſecret hope ſhe had long indulged, of winning his affections, ſo near being thwarted.</p>
                     <p>But Miſs Sedgeley was too much ſubjected to the power of her uncle and aunt to have a will of her own, at leaſt, to dare to utter it. She received the commands of Lady Bendham with her accuſtomed ſubmiſſion, while all the conſolation for the grief they gave her was, "that ſhe reſolved to make a very bad wife."</p>
                     <p>"I ſhall not care a pin for my huſband," ſhe ſaid to herſelf, "and ſo I will dreſs and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit, and do juſt as I like—he dares not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:030623_0095_0FE83CB41E6CB240"/>
becauſe of my aunt.—Beſides, now I think again, it is not ſo diſagreeable to marry <hi>him</hi> as if I were obliged to marry into any other family, becauſe I ſhall ſee his couſin Henry as often, if not oftener, than ever."</p>
                     <p>For Miſs Sedgeley, with a perſon he did not like, and with a mind thus diſpoſed, William began to force himſelf to ſhake off every little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining affection, even all pity, for the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, the beautiful, the ſenſible, the doating Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah; and determined to place in a ſituation to look down with ſcorn upon her ſorrows, this weak, this unprincipled woman.</p>
                     <p>Connections, intereſt, honours, were powerful advocates—his private happineſs William deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed trivial, compared to public opinion—and to be under obligations to a peer, his wife's relation, gave greater renown, in his ſervile mind, than all the advantages that might accrue from his own intrinſic independent worth.</p>
                     <p>In the uſual routine of pretended regard, and real indifference, ſometimes diſguſt, between parties allied by what is falſely termed <hi>prudence,</hi> the intended union of Mr. Norwynne with Miſs Sedgeley proceeded in all due form; and at their country ſeats at Anfield, during the ſummer, their nuptials were appointed to be celebrated.</p>
                     <p>William was now introduced into all Lord Bendham's courtly circles—his worldly ſoul was
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:030623_0096_0FE83CB5A5E89700"/>
entranced in glare and ſhow—he thought of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but places, penſions, titles, retinues:—and ſtedfaſt, alert, unſhaken in the purſuit of honours, neglected not the leſſer means of riſing to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment—his own endowments. But in this round of attention to pleaſures and to ſtudy, he no more complained to Hannah of "exceſs of buſineſs." Cruel as ſhe had once thought that letter in which he thus apologiſed for neglecting her, ſhe at laſt began to think it was wonderous kind; for he never found time to ſend her ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Yet ſhe had ſtudied with all her moſt anxious care to write him an anſwer; ſuch a one as might not leſſon her underſtanding, which he had often praiſed, in his eſteem.</p>
                     <p>Ah William! even with leſs anxiety your beating ambitious heart panted for the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an attentive auditory, when you firſt ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to harrangue in public!—With far leſs hope and fear (great as yours were) did you firſt addreſs a crowded court, and thirſt for its appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation on your efforts, than Hannah ſighed for your approbation, when ſhe took a pen and awkwardly ſcrawled over a ſheet of paper. Near twenty times ſhe began—but to a gentleman—and one ſhe loved like William—what could ſhe dare to ſay? Yet ſhe had enough to tell, if ſhame had not interpoſed—or, if remaining con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in his affection had but encouraged her.</p>

Overwhelmed by the firſt, and deprived of the laſt, her hand ſhook, her head drooped, and ſhe dared not communicate what ſhe knew muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inevitably render her letter unpleaſing and ſtill more depreciate her in his regard as the occaſion of incumbrance; and of injury to his moral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</p>

                     <p>SUMMER arrived—and lords and ladies who had partaken of all the diſſipation of the town, whom opera-houſes, gaming-houſes, and various other houſes had detained whole nights from their peaceful home, were now poured forth from the metropolis, to imbibe the wholeſome air of the farmer and peaſant, and diſſeminate in return mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and religious principles.</p>
                     <p>Among the reſt, Lord and Lady Bendham, ſtrenuous oppoſers of vice in the poor, and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſupporters of it in the rich, never played at cards, or had concerts on a Sunday, in the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, where the poor were ſpies—<hi>he</hi> there never gamed, or drank, except in private—and <hi>ſhe</hi> ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from her doors every female of ſullied cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. Yet poverty and ideotiſm are not the ſame—the poor can hear, can talk, ſometimes can reflect—ſervants will tell their equals how they live in town—liſteners will ſmile and ſhake their heads—and thus, hypocriſy, inſtead of culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating, deſtroys every ſeed of moral virtue.</p>
                     <p>The arrival of Lord Bendham's family at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, announced to the village that the dean's would quickly follow. Rebecca's heart boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with joy at the proſpect—Poor Hannah felt a ſinking, a foreboding tremor, that wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted the joy of <hi>her</hi> expectations—She had
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:030623_0099_0FE83CD64F93ABC0"/>
not heard from William for five tedious months—ſhe did not know whether he loved or deſpiſed—whether he thought of, or had forgotten her. Her reaſon argued againſt the hope that he loved her—yet hope ſtill ſubſiſted—ſhe would not aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don herſelf to deſpair while there was doubt—ſhe "had frequently been deceived from the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of circumſtances, and perhaps he might come all kindneſs—perhaps—even not like her the leſs for that indiſpoſition which had changed her bloom to paleneſs, and the ſparkling of her eyes to a penſive langour."</p>
                     <p>Henry's ſenſations on his return to Anfield were the ſelf-ſame as Rebecca's were: ſympathy in thought, ſympathy in affection, ſympathy in virtue, made them ſo. As he approached near the little village, he felt more light than uſual. He had committed no treſpaſs there, dreaded no one's reproach or enquiries, but his arrival might prove, at leaſt to one object, the cauſe of rejoicing.</p>
                     <p>William's ſenſations were the reverſe of theſe. In ſpite of his ambition, and the flattering view of accompliſhing all to which it aſpired, he often, as they proceeded on their journey, envied the gaiety of Henry, and felt an inward monitor, that told him, "he muſt firſt act like Henry, to be as happy."</p>
                     <p>His intended marriage was ſtill, to the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of both parties, (except to the heads of the
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:030623_0100_0FE83DC5CEAF2F90"/>
houſes) a profound ſecret. Neither the ſervants, nor even Henry had received the ſlighteſt intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the deſigned alliance; and this to Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am was matter of ſome comfort.</p>
                     <p>When men ſubmit to act in contradiction to their principles, nothing is ſo precious as a ſecret. In their eſtimation, to have their conduct <hi>known</hi> is the eſſential miſchief—while it is hid, they fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy the ſin but half committed; and to the moie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a crime, they reconcile their feelings, till, in progreſſion, the whole, when diſcloſed, appears tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial. He deſigned that Hannah ſhould receive the news from himſelf by degrees, and in ſuch a manner as to conſole her, or at leaſt to ſilence her complaints: and with a wiſh to ſoften the ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like regret, which he ſtill felt on the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent neceſſity of yielding her up when his marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age ſhould take place, he promiſed to himſelf ſome intervening hours of private meetings, which he hoped would produce ſatiety.</p>
                     <p>While Henry flew to Mr. Rymer's houſe with a conſcience clear, and a face enlightened with gladneſs; while he met Rebecca with open-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted friendſhip and frankneſs that charmed her ſoul to peaceful happineſs; William ſkulked around the cottage of Hannah, dreading detection; and when towards midnight he found the means to obtain the company of the ſad inhabitant, he grew ſo impatient at her tears and ſobs, at the delicacy
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:030623_0101_0FE83CD7EC644DB8"/>
with which ſhe with-held her careſſes, that he burſt into bitter upbraidings at her coyneſs; and at length (without diſcovering the cauſe of her peculiar agitation and reſerve) abruptly left her, knowing "never to ſee her more."</p>
                     <p>As he turned away, his heart even congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated him, "that he had made ſo diſcreet a uſe of his momentary diſappointment, as thus to ſhake her off at once without farther explanation or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe."</p>
                     <p>She, ignorant and illiterate as ſhe was, knew enough of her own heart to judge of his, and to know, that ſuch violent affections and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, above all, ſuch a ſudden, heart-breaking, manner of departure, were not the effects of love: not even of humanity. She felt herſelf debaſed by a ruffian—yet ſtill, having loved him when ſhe thought him otherwiſe, the blackeſt proof of the deception could not eraſe a ſentiment, formed while ſhe was deceived.</p>
                     <p>She paſſed the remainder of the night in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh—but with the cheerful morning ſome cheerly thoughts aroſe. She thought "perhaps William by this time had found himſelf to blame—had conceived the cauſe of her grief and her diſtant behaviour, and had pitied her."</p>
                     <p>The next evening ſhe waited with anxious heart for the ſignal that had called her out the foregoing night—in vain ſhe watched, counted
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:030623_0102_0FE83E0962E453C8"/>
the hours, and the ſtars, and liſtened to the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtillneſs of the fields around: they were not diſturbed by the tread of her lover.—Day-light came; the ſun roſe in its ſplendour; William had not been near her, and it ſhone upon none ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable as Hannah.</p>
                     <p>She now conſidered his word, "never to ſee her more," as ſolemnly paſſed—ſhe heard anew the impreſſive, the implacable tone in which the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was pronounced; and could look back on no late token of affection, on which to found the ſlighteſt hope that he would recall it.</p>
                     <p>Still, reluctant to deſpair—in the extremity of grief, in the extremity of fear for an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching criſis that muſt ſpeedily arrive, ſhe (after a few days had elapſed) truſted a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring peaſant with a letter to deliver to Mr. Norwynne in private.</p>
                     <p>This letter, unlike the laſt, was dictated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the hope to pleaſe—no pains were taken with the ſtyle, no care in the formation of the letters—the words flowed from neceſſity; ſtrong ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity guided her hand.</p>

                     <p>WHEN the dean's family had been at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field about a month—one miſty morning, ſuch as portends a ſultry day, as Henry was walking ſwiftly through a thick wood on the ſkirts of the pariſh, he ſuddenly ſtarted on hearing a diſtant groan, expreſſive, as he thought, both of bodily and mental pain.—He ſtopped to hear it repeated that he might purſue the ſound. He heard it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; and though now but in murmurs, yet as the tone implied exceſſive grief, he directed his courſe to that part of the wood from whence it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> he advanced, in ſpite of the thick fog, he
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:030623_0104_0FE83D2D82B2A898"/>
diſcerned the appearance of a female ſcudding away on his approach. His eye was fixed on this object; and regardleſs where he placed his feet, ſoon he ſhrunk back with horror, on per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving they had nearly trod upon a new-born infant, lying on the ground!—a lovely male child entered on a world where not one preparation had been made to receive him.</p>
                     <p>"Ah!" cried Henry, forgetting the perſon who had ſled, and with a ſmile of compaſſion on the helpleſs infant, "I am glad I have found you—you give more joy to me, than you have done to your hapleſs parents. Poor dear," (continued he, while he took off his coat to wrap it in,) "I will take care of you while I live—I will beg for you rather than you ſhall want—but firſt, I will carry you to thoſe who at preſent can do more for you than myſelf."</p>
                     <p>Thus Henry ſaid and thought while he inclos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the child carefully in his coat, and took it in his arms. But about to walk his way with it, an unlucky query ſtruck him, <hi>where he ſhould go.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>"I muſt not take it to the dean's," he cried, "becauſe Lady Clementina will ſuſpect it is not nobly, and my uncle will ſuſpect it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully born. Nor muſt I take it to Lord Bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's for the ſelf-ſame reaſon—though could it call Lady Bendham mother, this whole village, nay the whole country round would ring with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicings
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:030623_0105_0FE83DCF88BEF7C8"/>
for his birth. How ſtrange!" continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued he, "that we ſhould make ſo little of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man creatures, that one ſent among us, wholly independent of his own high value, becomes a curſe inſtead of a bleſſing by the mere accident of worthleſs circumſtances."</p>
                     <p>He now, after walking out of the wood, peep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through the folds of his coat to look again at his charge—He ſtarted, turned pale, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to behold what, in the ſurpriſe of firſt ſeeing the child, had eſcaped his obſervation. Around its little throat was a cord entwined by a ſlipping nooſe, and drawn half way—as if the trembling hand of the murderer had revolted from its dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful office, and he or ſhe had left the infant to pine away with nakedneſs and hunger, rather than <hi>ſee</hi> it die.</p>
                     <p>Again Henry wiſhed himſelf joy of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure he had found; and more fervently than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; for he had not only preſerved one fellow creature from death, but another from murder.</p>
                     <p>Once more he looked at his charge, and was tranſported to obſerve, upon its ſerene brow and ſleepy eye, no traces of the dangers it had paſſed—no trait of ſhame either for itſelf or its parents—no diſcompoſure at the unwelcome reception it was likely to encounter from a proud world!—He now ſlipped the fatal ſtring from its neck; and by this affectionate diſturbance cauſing the
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:030623_0106_0FE83DB50827BCF0"/>
child to cry, he ran (but he ſcarce knew whither) to convey it to a better nurſe.</p>
                     <p>He at length found himſelf at the door of his dear Rebecca—for ſo very happy Henry felt at the good luck which had befallen him, that he longed to beſtow a part of the bleſſing upon her he loved.</p>
                     <p>He ſent for her privately out of the houſe to ſpeak to him.—When ſhe came,</p>
                     <p>"Rebecca," ſaid he (looking around that no one obſerved him) "Rebecca, I have brought you ſomething you will like."</p>
                     <p>"What is it?" ſhe aſked.</p>
                     <p>"You know, Rebecca, that you love deſerted birds, ſtrayed kittens, and motherleſs lambs—I have brought ſomething more pitiable than any of theſe. Go, get a cap and a little gown, and then I will give it you."</p>
                     <p>"A gown!" exclaimed Rebecca. "If you have brought me a monkey, much as I ſhould eſteem any preſent from <hi>you,</hi> indeed I cannot touch it."</p>
                     <p>"A monkey!" repeated Henry, almoſt in anger—then changing the tone of his voice, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed in triumph,</p>
                     <p>"It is child!"</p>
                     <p>On this he gave it a gentle pinch, that its cry might confirm the pleaſing truth he ſpoke.</p>
                     <p>"A child!" repeated Rebecca in amaze.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="107" facs="unknown:030623_0107_0FE7ED4EAF146DE0"/>
"Yes, and indeed I found it."</p>
                     <p>"Found it."</p>
                     <p>"Indeed I did. The mother, I fear, had juſt forſaken it."</p>
                     <p>"Inhuman creature!"</p>
                     <p>"Nay, hold Rebecca! I am ſure you will pity her when you ſee her child—you then will know ſhe muſt have loved it—and will conſider how much ſhe certainly had ſuffered, before ſhe left it to periſh in a wood."</p>
                     <p>"Cruel!" once more exclaimed Rebecca.</p>
                     <p>"Oh! Rebecca, perhaps, had ſhe poſſeſſed a home of her own, ſhe would have given it the beſt place in it—had ſhe poſſeſſed money, ſhe would have dreſſed it with the niceſt care—or had ſhe been accuſtomed to diſgrace, ſhe would have glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in calling it hers! But now, as it is, it is ſent to us, to you and me, Rebecca, to take care of."</p>
                     <p>Rebecca, ſoothed by Henry's compaſſionate eloquence, held out her arms and received the important parcel—and, as ſhe kindly looked in upon the little ſtranger,</p>
                     <p>"Now are not you much obliged to me," ſaid Henry, "for having brought it to you? I know no one but yourſelf to whom I would have truſted it with pleaſure."</p>
                     <p>"Much obliged to you," repeated Rebecca with a very ſerious face, "if I did but know
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:030623_0108_0FE7ECF527FDEA40"/>
what to do with it—where to put it—where to hide it from my father and ſiſters."</p>
                     <p>"Oh! any where," returned Henry—"It is very good—It will not cry—But if they ſhould diſcover it, they will take it from you, proſecute the wretched mother, and ſend the child to the workhouſe."</p>
                     <p>"I will do all I can;" replied Rebecca, "and I know I can take milk from the dairy, and bread from the pantry, without its being miſſed, or my father much the poorer.—But if it ſhould cry—"</p>
                     <p>That inſtant they were interrupted by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the ſtern curate at a little diſtance—Henry was obliged to run ſwiftly away, while Rebecca returned by ſtealth into the houſe with her innocent burthen.</p>

                     <p>While thus ſhe unwittingly thought, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times watched through the night, ſtarting with convulſed rapture at every found, becauſe it might poſſibly be the harbinger of him; <hi>he</hi> was buſied in carefully looking over marriage articles, fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the place of reſidence with his deſtined bride, or making love to her in formal proceſs.—Yet, Hannah, vaunt—he ſometimes thought on thee—he could not witneſs the folly, the weakneſs, the vanity, the ſelfiſhneſs of his future wife, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out frequently comparing her with thee. When equivocal words, and prevaricating ſentences fell from her lips, he remembered with a ſigh thy can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour—that open ſincerity which dwelt upon thy tongue, and ſeemed to vie with thy undiſguiſed features, to charm the liſtener even beyond the ſpectator. While Miſs Sedgeley eagerly graſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at all the preſents he offered, he could not but call to mind "that Hannah's declining hand was always cloſed, and her looks forbidding, every time he proffered ſuch diſreſpectful tokens of his love. He recollected the ſoftneſs that beamed from Hannah's eyes, the bluſh on her face at his approach, while he could never diſcern one glance of tenderneſs from the niece of Lord Bendham:
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:030623_0113_0FE83D3211EEE1A0"/>
and the artificial bloom on her cheeks was near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as diſguſting, as the ill-conducted artifice with which ſhe attempted gentleneſs and love.</p>
                     <p>But all theſe impediments were only obſerved as trials of his fortitude—his prudence could o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome his averſion, and thus he valued himſelf upon his manly firmneſs.</p>
                     <p>'Twas now, that having rid himſelf, by Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah's peeviſhneſs, moſt honourably of all future ties to her; and the day of his marriage with Miſs Sedgeley being fixed, that Henry, with the reſt of the houſe, learnt, what to them, was news.—The firſt dart of Henry's eye upon William when, in his preſence, he was told of it, cauſed a reddening on the face of the latter: he always fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied Henry ſaw his thoughts, and he knew that Henry in return would give him <hi>his.</hi> On the preſent occaſion, no ſooner were they alone, and Henry began to utter them, than William char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him,</p>
                     <p>"Not to dare to proceed; for that, too long accuſtomed to trifle, the time was come when ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious matters could alone employ his time; and when men of approved ſenſe muſt take place of friends and confidents like him."</p>
                     <p>Henry replied, "The love, the ſincerity of friends, I thought, were their beſt accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; thoſe I poſſeſs."</p>
                     <p>"But you do not poſſeſs knowledge."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="7" facs="unknown:030623_0114_0FE83D9C51BDDAD8"/>
"If that is knowledge which has of late eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged you from all who bear you a ſincere affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which imprints every day more and more upon your features the marks of gloomy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietude, am I not happier in my ignorance?"</p>
                     <p>"Do not torment me with you ineffectual reaſoning."</p>
                     <p>"I called at the cottage of poor Hannah the other day," returned Henry: "her father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were eating their homely meal alone; and when I aſked for their daughter, they wept and ſaid—Hannah was not the girl ſhe had been."</p>
                     <p>William caſt his eyes on the floor.</p>
                     <p>Henry proceeded—"They ſaid a ſickneſs, which they feared would bring her to the grave, had preyed upon her for ſome time paſt. They had procured a doctor, but no remedy was found, and they feared the worſt."</p>
                     <p>"What worſt?" cried William, (now reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the effect of the ſudden intelligence, and attempting a ſmile) "Do they think ſhe will die? And do you think it will be for love? We do not hear of theſe deaths often, Henry."</p>
                     <p>"And if <hi>ſhe</hi> die, who will hear of <hi>that?</hi> No one but thoſe intereſted to conceal the cauſe: And thus it is, that dying for love becomes a phenomenon."</p>
                     <p>Henry would have purſued the diſcourſe far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but William, impatient on all ſubjects, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:030623_0115_0FE83E1C6143AFA0"/>
where his argument was the better, retired from the controverſy, crying out, "I know my duty, and want no inſtructor."</p>
                     <p>It would be unjuſt to William to ſay, he did not feel for Hannah's reported illneſs—he felt, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that whole evening, and part of the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning—but buſineſs, pleaſures, new occupations, and new ſchemes of future ſucceſs, crowded to diſſipate all unwelcome reflections; and he truſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in her youth, her health, her animal ſpirits, and above all, in the folly of the goſſips' ſtory of <hi>dying for love,</hi> as a ſurety for her life, and a ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard for his conſcience.</p>

                     <p>THE child of William and Hannah was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creted by Rebecca in her own chamber, a garret, and at ſome diſtance from where her ſiſters ſlept. There ſhe adminiſtered to all its wants, viewed almoſt with the joy of a mother its health, its promiſed life; and in a ſhort time found ſhe loved her little gift, better than any thing on earth, except the giver.</p>
                     <p>Henry called the next day, and the next, and many ſucceeding times, in hopes of an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to ſpeak alone with Rebecca, to enquire concerning her charge, and conſult when, and how, he could privately relieve her from her
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:030623_0116_0FE83E0AE89626E8"/>
truſt; as he now meant to procure a nurſe for wages. In vain he called or lurked around the houſe—for near five weeks all the converſation he could obtain with her was in the company of her ſiſters, who beginning to obſerve his prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, his marked attention to her, indulged their envy and reſentment at the contempt ſhown to their charms, by watching her ſteps when he was away, and her every look and whiſper while he was preſent.</p>
                     <p>For five weeks, then, he was continually thwarted in his expectation of meeting her alone; and at the end of that period, the whole deſign he had to accompliſh by ſuch a meeting, was ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered abortive.</p>
                     <p>Though Rebecca had every day and night with ſtricteſt caution locked her bed-chamber door, and covered the crevices, and every aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of her room through which ſound might more eaſily proceed; though ſhe had ſurrounded the infant's head with pillows to obſtruct all noiſe from his crying, yet one unlucky night, the ſtrength of his voice encreaſing with his age, he was heard by the maid who ſlept in the oppoſite garret.</p>
                     <p>Not meaning to injure her young miſtreſs, the ſervant next morning ſimply related to the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what ſounds had ſtruck her ear during the night; but from what part of the houſe they
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:030623_0117_0FE83E2CF71CA480"/>
came, ſhe would not undertake directly to ſay.—At firſt ſhe was ridiculed "for ſuppoſing her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf awake when in reality ſhe muſt be dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing." But ſtedfaſtly perſiſting in what ſhe had ſaid, and Rebecca's confuſion giving much colour to the improbable tale, her chamber was ſearched by her ſiſters, the infant diſcovered, and brought down to their father.</p>
                     <p>That account which Henry had given Rebec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca "of his having found the child," and which her own ſincerity, joined to the faith ſhe had in his word, made her receive as truth; ſhe now felt would be heard by the preſent auditors with contempt, even with indignation, as a falſehood. Her affright is better to be conceived than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</p>
                     <p>Dragged by her ſiſters along with the child before the curate, his crimſoned face, knit brow, and thundering voice, ſtruck with terror her very ſoul—Innocence is not always a protection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt fear—ſometimes leſs bold than guilt.</p>
                     <p>In her father and ſiſters, ſhe ſaw, ſhe knew the ſuſpicious, partial, cruel, boiſterous natures by whom ſhe was to be judged; and timid, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, oppreſſed; ſhe fell trembling on her knees, and could only articulate,</p>
                     <p>"Forgive me."</p>
                     <p>The curate would not liſten to this ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion till ſhe had replied to his queſtion—"Whoſe child is this?"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="11" facs="unknown:030623_0118_0FE83D6182C90728"/>
She replied, "I do not know."</p>
                     <p>Queſtioned louder, and with more violence ſtill, "How the child came there, and whoſe it was?" ſhe felt the improbability of the truth ſtill more forcibly than before, and dreaded ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate peril from her father's rage, ſhould ſhe dare to relate an apparent lie—ſhe pauſed to think on a more probable tale than the real one—and as ſhe heſitated, ſhook in every limb—while her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exclaimed—</p>
                     <p>"I underſtand the cauſe of this terror!—From your infancy I predicted that ſome fatal cataſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe would befall you—I never loved you like my other children—I never had the cauſe—you were always unlike the reſt—and I knew your fate would be calamitous—but the very worſt of my forebodings did not come to this—ſo young, ſo guilty, and ſo artful!—tell me this inſtant, are you married?"</p>
                     <p>Rebecca anſwered, "No."</p>
                     <p>The ſiſters lifted up their hands!</p>
                     <p>The father continued—"Vile proſtitute, I thought as much.—Still I will know the father of this child."</p>
                     <p>She caſt up her eyes to heaven, and firmly vowed ſhe "did not know herſelf—nor who the mother was."</p>
                     <p>"This is not to be borne!" exclaimed the curate in fury. "Perſiſt in this, and you never
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:030623_0119_0FE83D00CE7EFBB8"/>
ſee my face again. Both your child and you I'll turn out of my houſe inſtantly, unleſs you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs your crime, and own the father."</p>
                     <p>Curious to know this ſecret, the ſiſters went up to Rebecca with ſeeming kindneſs, and—"Conjured her to ſpare her father ſtill greater grief, and her own and her child's public infamy, by acknowledging herſelf its mother; and nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the man who had ſeduced her."</p>
                     <p>Emboldened by this inſult from her own ſex, Rebecca now began to declare the ſimple truth. But no ſooner had ſhe ſaid that—"The child was the gift of a young man who had found it—" than her ſiſters burſt into laughter, and her father into freſh fits of rage.</p>
                     <p>Once more the women offered their advice—"To confeſs and be forgiven."</p>
                     <p>Once more the father raved.</p>
                     <p>Beguiled by ſolicitations, and terrified by threats, ſhe at length felt inclined to take the mother's ſhare of the infant, but was at a loſs to whom to give the father's. She thought that Henry had entailed on himſelf the beſt right to the charge; but ſhe loved him, and could not bear the idea of accuſing him falſely.</p>
                     <p>While, with agitation in the extreme, ſhe thus deliberated, the propoſition again was put,</p>
                     <p>"Whether ſhe would truſt to the mercy of her father by confeſſing, or draw down his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate vengeance by denying her guilt?"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="13" facs="unknown:030623_0120_0FE83D6A097DA060"/>
She made choice of the former—and with tears and ſobs "Owned herſelf the mother of the boy."</p>
                     <p>But ſtill—"Who is the father?"</p>
                     <p>Again ſhe ſhrunk from the queſtion, and fervently implored—" To be ſpared on that point."</p>
                     <p>Her petition was rejected with vehemence; and the curate's rage encreaſed till ſhe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,</p>
                     <p>"Henry was the father."</p>
                     <p>"I thought ſo," exclaimed all her ſiſters at the ſame time.</p>
                     <p>"Villain!" cried the curate. "The dean ſhall know, before this hour is expired, the baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the nephew whom he ſupports upon cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: he ſhall know the miſery, the grief, the ſhame he has brought on me, and know how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy he is of his protection."</p>
                     <p>"Oh! have mercy on him!" cried Rebecca as ſhe ſtill knelt to her father: "Do not ruin him with his uncle, for he is the beſt of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures."</p>
                     <p>"Ay, ay, we always ſaw how much ſhe loved him," cried her ſiſters.</p>
                     <p>"Wicked, undone girl!" ſaid the clergyman (his rage now ſubſiding, and tears ſupplying its place) "you have drawn a curſe upon us all—your ſiſters reputation will be ſtampt with the colour of yours—my good name will ſuffer—
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:030623_0121_0FE83D849BE21B78"/>
but that is trivial—your ſoul is loſt to virtue, to religion, to ſhame—"</p>
                     <p>"No, <hi>indeed,</hi>" cried Rebecca,, "if you will but believe me."</p>
                     <p>"Do not I believe you? Have not you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed?"</p>
                     <p>"You would not pretend to unſay what you have ſaid," cried her eldeſt ſiſter, "that would be making things worſe."</p>
                     <p>"Go, go out of my ſight!" ſaid her father. "Take your child with you to your chamber, and never let me ſee either of you again.—I do not turn you out of my doors to-day, becauſe I gave you my word I would not if you revealed your ſhame—but by to-morrow I will provide ſome place for your reception, where neither I, nor any of your relations, ſhall ever ſee or hear of you more."</p>
                     <p>Rebecca made an effort to cling around her father, and once more to declare her innocence: but her ſiſters interpoſed, and ſhe was taken, with her reputed ſon, to the chamber where the curate had ſentenced her to remain, till ſhe quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his houſe forever.</p>

                     <p>THE curate, in the diſorder of his mind, ſcarce felt the ground he trod as he haſted to the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030623_0122_0FE83D025AF36DE8"/>
dean's to complain of his wrongs. His name procured him immediate admittance into the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary—and the moment the dean appeared, the curate burſt into tears.—The cauſe being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of ſuch "very ſingular marks of grief," Mr. Rymer deſcribed himſelf, "as having been a few months ago the happieſt of parents, but that his peace and that of his whole family had been deſtroyed by Mr. Henry Norwynne, the dean's nephew."</p>
                     <p>He now entered into a minute recital of Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's frequent viſits there, and of all that had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in his houſe that morning, from the ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion that a child was concealed under his roof, to the confeſſion made by his youngeſt daughter of her fall from virtue, and of her betrayer's name.</p>
                     <p>The dean was aſtoniſhed, ſhocked, and rouzed to anger: he vented reproaches and menaces on his nephew; and, "bleſſing himſelf in a virtuous ſon, whoſe wiſdom and counſel were his only ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace in every care," ſent for William to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with him on the unhappy ſubject.</p>
                     <p>William came, all obedience, and heard with marks of amazement and indignation the account of ſuch black villany! In perfect ſympathy with Mr. Rymer and his father, he allowed no "pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment could be too great for the ſeducer of innocence, the ſelfiſh invader of a whole family's repoſe."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="16" facs="unknown:030623_0123_0FE83DD69F857D10"/>
Nor did William here ſpeak what he did not think—he merely forgot his own conduct; or if he did recal it to his mind, it was with ſome fair interpretation in his own behalf; ſuch as ſelf-love ever ſupplies to thoſe who wiſh to cheat their conſcience.</p>
                     <p>Young Henry being ſent for to appear before this triumvirate, he came with a light ſtep and chearful face. But, on the charge againſt him being exhibited, his countenance changed—yet, only to the expreſſion of ſurpriſe! He boldly aſſerted his innocence, plainly told the real fact; and with a deportment ſo perfectly unembarraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that nothing but the aſſervations of the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, "that his daughter had confeſſed the whole," could have rendered the ſtory Henry told ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; although ſome of the incidents he related were of no common kind. But Mr. Rymer's charge was an objection to his veracity, too po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be overcome; and the dean exclaimed in rage—</p>
                     <p>"We want not your avowal of your guilt—the mother's evidence is teſtimony ſufficient."</p>
                     <p>"The virtuous Rebecca is not a mother," ſaid Henry, with firmneſs.</p>
                     <p>William here, like Rebecca's ſiſters, took Henry aſide, and warned him not to "add to his offence by denying what was proved againſt him."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="17" facs="unknown:030623_0124_0FE83CFA0CE9A618"/>
But Henry's ſpirit was too manly, his affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion too ſincere, not to vindicate the chaſtity of her he loved, even at his own peril. He again and again proteſted "ſhe was virtuous."</p>
                     <p>"Let her inſtantly be ſent for," ſaid the dean, "and this madman confronted with her." Then adding, that as he wiſhed every thing might be conducted with ſecrecy, he would not employ his clerk on the unhappy occaſion; he deſired Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam to draw up the form of an oath, which he would adminiſter as ſoon as ſhe arrived.</p>
                     <p>A man and horſe were immediately diſpatched to bring Rebecca: William drew up an affidavit as his father had directed him—<hi>in Rebecca's name ſolemnly proteſting ſhe was a mother, and Henry, the father of her child</hi>—and now, the dean, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing till ſhe came the warmth of his anger ſpoke thus calmly to Henry:</p>
                     <p>"Even ſuppoſing that your improbable tale of having found this child, and all your declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in reſpect to it were true, ſtill you would be greatly criminal: what plea can you make for not having immediately revealed the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to me or ſome other proper perſon, that the real mother might be detected and puniſhed for her deſign of murder?"</p>
                     <p>"In that perhaps I was to blame," returned Henry: "but whoever the mother was, I pitied her."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="18" facs="unknown:030623_0125_0FE83E11E3CEEE60"/>
"Compaſſion on ſuch an occaſion was ill pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced," ſaid the dean.</p>
                     <p>"Was I wrong, Sir, to pity the child?"</p>
                     <p>"No."</p>
                     <p>"Then how could I feel for <hi>that,</hi> and yet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt myſelf of all feeling for its mother?"</p>
                     <p>"Its mother!" (exclaimed William, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger) "ſhe ought to have been immediately pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, apprehended, and committed to priſon."</p>
                     <p>"It ſtruck me, couſin William," replied Henry, "that the father was moſt deſerving a priſon: the poor woman had abandoned only <hi>one</hi>—the man, in all likelihood, had forſaken <hi>two.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>William was pouring execrations "on the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, if ſuch there could be," when Rebecca was announced.</p>
                     <p>Her eyes were half-cloſed with weeping; deep confuſion overſpread her face; and her tottering limbs could hardly ſupport her to the awful cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber where the dean, her father, and William ſat in judgment, whilſt her beloved Henry ſtood ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned as a culprit, by her falſe evidence.</p>
                     <p>Upon her entrance, her father firſt addreſſed her, and ſaid in a ſtern, threatening, yet feeling tone, "Unhappy girl, anſwer me before all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent—Have you, or have you not, owned your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a mother?"</p>
                     <p>She replied, ſtealing a fearful look at Henry, "I have."</p>

"And have you not," aſked the dean, "own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Henry Norwynne is the father of your child?"</p>

                     <p>"I have," ſhe faintly replied.</p>
                     <p>"Then here," cried the dean to William, "read that paper to her, and take the Bible."</p>
                     <p>William read the paper, which in her name declared a momentous falſehood: he then held the book in form, while ſhe looked like one diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted—wrung her hands, and was near ſinking to the earth.</p>
                     <p>At the moment the book was lifted up to her lips to kiſs, Henry ruſhed to her—"Stop," he cried, "Rebecca, do not hurt your future peace; do not be terrified into the commiſſion of a crime which hereafter will diſtract your delicate conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. My confeſſion will be a teſtimony equal to your oath—will render it needleſs—and here I acknowledge that all you have aſſerted is truth."</p>
                     <p>"Surpriſing audacity!—Complicated vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>any!" exclaimed the dean—then added, "Henry Norwyne, your firſt guilt is ſo enormous, your ſecond, in ſtedfaſtly denying it, ſo baſe; this laſt conduct ſo unaccountable! that from the preſent hour you muſt never dare to call me relation, or to conſider my houſe as your home."</p>

William, in uniſon with his father, exclaimed, "Indeed, Henry, your actions merit this puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment."</p>
                     <p>Henry anſwered with firmneſs, "Inflict what puniſhment you pleaſe."</p>
                     <p>"With the dean's permiſſion then," (ſaid the curate) "you muſt marry my daughter."</p>
                     <p>Henry ſtarted—"Marry her! Marry Rebec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca! Do you pronounce that as a puniſhment? It would be the greateſt bleſſing Providence could beſtow.—But how are we to live? My uncle is too much offended ever to be my friend again; and in this country, people of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain claſs are ſo educated they cannot exiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the aſſiſtance, or what is called the patronage, of others; when that is with-held, they ſteal or ſtarve. Heaven protect Rebecca from ſuch misfortune!—Sir, (to the curate) do you but conſent to ſupport her a year or two longer, and in that time I will learn ſome occupation that ſhall raiſe me to the eminence of maintaining both her and myſelf without one obligation, or one inconvenience to another."</p>
                     <p>Rebecca exclaimed, "Oh! you have ſaved me from ſuch a weight of ſin, that my future life would be too happy paſſed as your ſlave."</p>
                     <p>"No, my dear Rebecca, return to your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's houſe, return to ſlavery but for a few years more, and the reſt of your life I will make free."</p>

"And can you forgive me?"</p>
                     <p>"I can love you: and in that is compriſed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing that is kind."</p>
                     <p>The curate, who, bating a few paſſions and a few prejudices, was a man of ſome worth and feeling, had felt, in the midſt of her diſtreſs, though the reſult of crimes, that he loved this neglected daughter better than he had before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; and he now agreed "to take her home for a time, provided ſhe were relieved from the child, and the matter ſo huſhed up, that it might draw no imputation upon the characters of his other daughters."</p>
                     <p>The dean did not degrade his conſequence by conſultations of this nature; but, having pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated (as he immagined) into the very bottom of this intricate ſtory, and iſſued his mandate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Henry—as a mark that he took no further concern in the matter, he proudly walked out of the room without uttering another word.</p>
                     <p>William as proudly, and as ſilently followed.</p>
                     <p>The curate was inclined to adopt the manners of ſuch great examples—but, ſelf-intereſt, ſome affection to Rebecca, and concern for the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his family, made him wiſh to talk a little with Henry; who now repeated what he had ſaid reſpecting his marriage with Rebecca, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed "to come the very next day in ſecret, and deliver her from the care of the infant; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

"But above all, ſaid the curate, "procure your uncle's pardon; for without that, without his protection, or the protection of ſome other rich man; to marry, to obey God's ordinance, <hi>increaſe and multiply,</hi> is to want food for yourſelf and your offspring."</p>

                     <p>THOUGH this unfortunate occurrence in the curate's family was, according to his own phraſe, "to be huſhed up," yet certain perſons of his, of the dean's, and of Lord Bendham's houſe, immediately heard and talked of it. Among theſe, lady Bendham was moſt of all ſhocked and offended; ſhe "never could bear to hear Mr. Rymer either pray or preach again—he had not conducted himſelf with proper dignity either as a clergyman or a father—he ſhould have imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated the dean's example in reſpect to Henry, and have turned his daughter out of doors."</p>
                     <p>Lord Bendham was leſs ſevere on the ſeduced, but had no mercy on the ſeducer—"a vicious youth, without one accompliſhment to endear vice"—For vice, Lord Bendham thought (with ſome philoſophers) might be moſt exquiſitely pleaſing, in a pleaſing garb. "But this youth ſinned without elegance, without one particle of wit, or an atom of good breeding."</p>

                        <pb n="23" facs="unknown:030623_0130_0FE83D55A7DB3F40"/>
Lady Clementina would not permit the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to be mentioned a ſecond time in her hearing—extreme delicacy in woman ſhe knew was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching; and the delicacy ſhe diſplayed on this occaſion went ſo far that ſhe "could not even intercede with the dean to forgive his nephew, becauſe the topic was too groſs for her lips to name even in the ear of her huſband."</p>
                     <p>Miſs Sedgeley, though on the very eve of her bridal day with William, felt ſo tender a regard for Henry, that often ſhe thought "Rebecca happier in diſgrace and poverty, bleſt with the love of him, than ſhe was likely to be in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of friends and fortune with his couſin."</p>
                     <p>Had Henry been of a nature to ſuſpect others of evil, or had he felt a confidence in his own worth, ſuch a paſſion as this young woman's would ſoon have diſcloſed its exiſtence: but he, regardleſs of any attractions of Miſs Sedgeley, equally ſuppoſed he had none in her eyes; and thus, fortunately for the peace of all parties, this prepoſſeſſion ever remained a ſecret except to herſelf.</p>
                     <p>So little did William conceive that his clown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh couſin could rival him in the affections of a woman of faſhion, that he even ſlightly ſolicited his father "that Henry might not be baniſhed from the houſe, at leaſt till after the following

day, when the great feſtival of his marriage was to be celebrated."</p>
                     <p>But the dean refuſed; and reminded his ſon, "That he was bound both by his moral and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious character, in the eyes of God, and ſtill more, in the eyes of men, to ſhew laſting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment of iniquity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>William acquieſced, and immediately deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his couſin the dean's "wiſhes for his amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment," and a letter of recommendation procured from Lord Bendham, to introduce him on board a man of war; where, he was told, "he might hope to meet with preferment according to his merit as a ſailor and a gentleman."</p>
                     <p>Henry preſſed William's hand on parting—wiſhed him happy in his marriage—and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, as the only favour he would implore, an interview with his uncle—to thank him for all his former kindneſs, and ſee him for the laſt time.</p>
                     <p>William repeated this petition to his father, but with ſo little energy, that the dean did not grant it. He felt himſelf compelled to reſent that reprobate character in which Henry had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared; and he feared—"leſt the remembrance of his laſt parting from his brother might, on taking a formal leave of that brother's ſon, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him to ſome tokens of weakneſs, that would ill become his dignity and juſt diſpleaſure."</p>

                     <p>THE wedding day of Mr. William Norwynne with Miſs Caroline Sedgeley arrived—and on that day, the bells of every pariſh ſurrounding that in which they lived, joined with their own in celebration of the bliſsful union. Flowers were ſtrewed before the new married pair, and favours and ale made many a heart more glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, than that of either bridegroom or bride.</p>
                     <p>Upon this day of ringing and rejoicing, the bells were not muffled, nor was converſation on the ſubject with-held from the ear of Hannah! She heard like her neighbours; and ſitting on the ſide of her bed in her little chamber, ſuffered, under the cottage roof, as much affliction as ever viſited a palace.</p>
                     <p>Tyrants, who have embrued their hands in the blood of myriads of their fellow creatures, can call their murders "religion, juſtice, attention to the good of mankind"—poor Hannah knew no ſophiſtry to calm <hi>her</hi> conſcience—ſhe felt her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a harlot and a murderer—a ſlighted, a deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:030623_0133_0FE83D4C6702C160"/>
wretch, bereft of all ſhe loved in this world, all ſhe could hope for in the next.</p>
                     <p>She complained bitterly of illneſs, nor could the entreaties of her father and mother prevail on her to ſhare in the ſports of this general holiday.—As none of her humble viſitors ſuſpected the cauſe of her more than ordinary indiſpoſition, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to divert it with an account of every thing they had ſeen at church—"What the bride wore, how joyful the bridegroom looked:" and all the little ſigns of that complete happineſs, which they conceived was for certain taſted.</p>
                     <p>Hannah, who, before this event, had at mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſuppreſſed the agoniſing ſting of guilt, in the faint proſpect of her lover one day reſtored; on this memorable occaſion loſt every glimpſe of hope, and was weighed to the earth with an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulation of deſpair.</p>
                     <p>Where is the degree in which the ſinner ſtops? Unhappy Hannah! the firſt time you permitted indecorous familiarity from a man who made you no promiſe, who gave you no hope of becoming his wife, who profeſt nothing beyond thoſe fervent though ſlender affections which attach the rake to the wanton—the firſt time you interpreted his kind looks and ardent prayers, into tenderneſs and conſtancy—the firſt time you deſcended from the character of purity, you ruſhed imperceptibly on the blackeſt crimes.—The more ſincerely you
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:030623_0134_0FE83D35D8BB0248"/>
loved, the more you plunged in danger—from one ungoverned paſſion proceeded a ſecond and a third. In the fervency of affection, you yielded up your virtue!—In the exceſs of fear, you ſtained your conſcience, by the intended murder of your child!—and now, in the violence of grief, you meditate—what?—to put an end to your exiſtence by your own hand!</p>
                     <p>After caſting her thoughts around, anxious to find ſome little bud of comfort on which to fix her longing eye; ſhe beheld, in the total loſs of William, nothing but a wide waſte, an exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive plain of anguiſh.—"How am I to be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained through this dreary journey of life?" ſhe exclaimed.—Upon this queſtion ſhe felt more poignantly than ever, her loſs of innocence—in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence would have been her ſupport—but, in place of this beſt prop to the afflicted, guilt flaſhed on her memory every time ſhe flew for aid to reflection.</p>
                     <p>At length, from horrible rumination, a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary alleviation came—"But one more ſtep in wickedneſs," ſhe triumphantly ſaid, "and all my ſhame, all my ſufferings are over." She congratulated herſelf upon the lucky thought—when, but an inſtant after, the tears trickled down her face for the ſorrow her death, her ſinful death, would bring to her poor, and beloved pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.—She then thought upon the probability of
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:030623_0135_0FE83E20EFD358E0"/>
a ſigh it might draw from William; and the pride, the pleaſure of that little tribute, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoiſed every ſtruggle on the ſide of life.</p>
                     <p>As ſhe ſaw the ſun decline, "When you riſe again," ſhe thought, "when you peep bright to-morrow morning into this little room to call me up, I ſhall not be here to open my eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a hateful day—I ſhall no more regret that you have waked me!—I ſhall be ſound aſleep, never to wake again in this wretched world—not even the voice of William would then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake me."</p>
                     <p>While ſhe found herſelf reſolved, and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſt come on, ſhe hurried out of the houſe, and haſtened to the fatal wood; the ſcene of her diſhonour—the ſcene of meditated murder—and now, the intended ſcene of ſuicide.</p>
                     <p>As ſhe walked along between the cloſe-ſet trees, ſhe ſaw at a little diſtance, the ſpot where William firſt made love to her; and where, at every appointment, he uſed to wait her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. She darted her eye away from this place with horror—but, after a few moments of emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhe walked ſlowly up to it—ſhed tears, and preſſed with her trembling lips that tree, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which he was accuſtomed to lean while he talked to her.—She felt an inclination to make this the ſpot to die in—but her preconcert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the leſs frightful death, of throwing her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:030623_0136_0FE83CCB0E9379D0"/>
into a pool on the other ſide of the wood, induced her to go onwards.</p>
                     <p>Preſently, ſhe came near the place where her child, and William's, was expoſed to periſh.—Here, ſhe ſtarted with a ſenſe of the moſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trocious guilt; and her whole frame ſhook with the dread of an approaching, an omnipotent judge to ſentence her for murder.</p>
                     <p>She halted, appalled! aghaſt! undetermined whether to exiſt longer beneath the preſſure of a criminal conſcience, or die that very hour and meet her final condemnation.</p>
                     <p>She proceeded a few ſteps farther, and beheld the very ivy-buſh cloſe to which her infant lay, when ſhe left him expoſed—and now, from this minute recollection, all the mother riſing in her ſoul, ſhe ſaw, as it were, her babe again in its deſerted ſtate; and, burſting into tears of bittereſt contrition and compaſſion, ſhe cried,</p>
                     <p>"As I was mercileſs to <hi>thee,</hi> my child, thy father has been pitileſs to <hi>me!</hi> As I abandoned <hi>thee</hi> to die with cold and hunger, he has forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and has driven <hi>me</hi> to die by ſelf-murder."</p>
                     <p>She now fixed her eager eyes on the diſtant pond, and walked more nimbly than before, to rid herſelf of her agoniſing ſenſe!</p>
                     <p>Juſt as ſhe had nearly reached the wiſhed-for brink, ſhe heard a footſtep, and ſaw, by the glimmering of a clouded moon, a man approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:030623_0137_0FE83DCE02892B80"/>
—She turned out of her path for fear her intentions ſhould be gueſſed at and thwarted; but ſtill, as ſhe walked another way, her eye was wiſhfully bent towards the water that was to obliterate her love and her remorſe—obliterate forever, William and his child.</p>
                     <p>It was now, that Henry—who, to prevent ſcandel, had ſtolen at that ſtill hour of night to rid the curate of the incumbrance ſo irkſome to him, and take the foundling to a woman whom he had hired for the charge—it was now that Henry came up, with the child of Hannah in his arms, carefully covered all over from the night's dew.</p>
                     <p>"Hannah, is it you?" (cried Henry, at a little diſtance) "Where are you going thus late?"</p>
                     <p>"Home, Sir," ſaid ſhe, and ruſhed among the trees.</p>
                     <p>"Stop, Hannah," he cried, "I want to bid you farewell—to-morrow I am going to leave this part of the country for a long time—So God bleſs you, Hannah!" Saying this, he ſtretched out his arm to ſhake her by the hand.</p>
                     <p>Her poor heart truſting that his bleſſing, for want of more potent offerings, might, perhaps, at this tremendous criſis, aſcend to heaven in her behalf: ſhe ſtopt, returned, and put out her hand to take his.</p>

"Softly," ſaid he, "don't wake my child—this ſpot has been a place of danger for him—for underneath this very ivy-buſh it was that I found him."</p>
                     <p>"Found what?" cried Hannah, with a voice elevated to a tremulous ſcream.</p>
                     <p>"I will not tell you," replied Henry, "for no one I have ever yet told of it, would believe me."</p>
                     <p>"I will believe you. I will believe you." She repeated with tones yet more impreſſive.</p>
                     <p>"Why then ſaid Henry, "only five weeks ago—"</p>
                     <p>"Ah!" ſhrieked Hannah.</p>
                     <p>"What do you mean?" ſaid Henry.</p>
                     <p>"Go on," ſhe articulated in the ſame voice.</p>
                     <p>"Why then, as I was paſſing this very place, I wiſh I may never ſpeak truth again, if I did not find"—here he pulled aſide the warm rug in which the infant was wrapt—"this beautiful child."</p>
                     <p>"With a cord?—"</p>
                     <p>"A cord was round its neck."</p>
                     <p>"'Tis mine—the child is mine—'tis mine—my child—I am the mother and the murderer—I fixed the cord, while the ground ſhook under me—while flaſhes of fire darted before my eyes!—while my heart was burſting with deſpair and horror.—But I ſtopt ſhort—I did not draw the

                     <p>Here ſhe took her infant, preſſed it to her lips and to her boſom; then bent to the ground, claſped Henry's knees, and wept upon his feet.</p>
                     <p>He could not for a moment doubt the truth of what ſhe ſaid—her powerful, yet broken accents, her convulſive ſtarts, even more than her decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, convinced him.</p>
                     <p>She now roſe from the earth in haſte, and ſtealing quick on one ſide, poſtponed farther gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to Henry, for the performance of the moſt endearing office of a mother.

                     <p>"I forget the exact time—but I remember it was on that very evening when I confeſſed to him—"</p>
                     <p>"What?"</p>
                     <p>"That he had won my heart."</p>
                     <p>"Why did you confeſs it?"</p>
                     <p>"Becauſe he aſked me, and ſaid it would make him happy if I would ſay ſo."</p>
                     <p>"Cruel! diſhonourable!"</p>
                     <p>"Nay, do not blame him—he cannot help <hi>not</hi> loving me, no more than I can help, <hi>loving</hi> him."</p>
                     <p>Henry rubbed his eyes.</p>
                     <p>"Bleſs me, you weep!—I always heard that you were brought up in a ſavage country; but I ſuppoſe it is a miſtake; it was your couſin William."</p>

"Will not you apply to him for the ſupport of your child?" aſked Henry.</p>
                     <p>"If I thought he would not be angry."</p>
                     <p>"Angry!—I will write to him on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, if you will give me leave."</p>
                     <p>"But do not ſay it is by my deſire. Do not ſay I wiſh to trouble him—I would ſooner beg, than be a trouble to him."</p>
                     <p>"Why are you ſo delicate?"</p>
                     <p>"It is for my own ſake—I wiſh him not to hate me."</p>
                     <p>"Then, thus you may ſecure his reſpect—I will write to him, and let him know all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of your caſe; I will plead for his compaſſion on his child, but aſſure him that no conduct of his will ever induce you to declare (except only to me, who knew of your previous acquaintance) who is the father."</p>
                     <p>To this Hannah conſented: but when Henry offered to take from her the infant and carry him to the nurſe he had engaged; to this ſhe would not conſent.</p>
                     <p>"Do you mean then to acknowledge him yours?" Henry aſked.</p>
                     <p>"Nothing ſhall force me to part from him. I will keep him, and let my neighbours judge of me as they pleaſe."</p>
                     <p>Here Henry caught at a hope he feared to name before. "You will then have no objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,"
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:030623_0142_0FE83E24D6E69C20"/>
ſaid he, "to clear an unhappy girl to a few friends with whom her character has ſuffered by becoming, at my requeſt, his nurſe?"</p>
                     <p>"Moſt gladly. I will clear any one ſo that I do not accuſe the father."</p>
                     <p>"You give me leave, then, in your name, to tell the whole ſtory to ſome particular friends, my couſin William's part in it alone excepted?"</p>
                     <p>"I do."</p>
                     <p>Henry now cried, "God bleſs you!" with greater fervor than when he ſpoke it before—and he hoped the night was nearly gone, that the time might be ſo much the ſhorter before Rebecca ſhould be reinſtated in the eſteem of her father, and of all thoſe who had misjudged her.</p>
                     <p>"God bleſs <hi>you!</hi>" ſaid Hannah, ſtill more fervently, as ſhe walked, with unguided ſteps, towards her home; for her eyes never wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the precious object that cauſed her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected return.</p>

                     <p>HENRY roſe early in the morning and flew to the curate's houſe, with more than even his uſual thirſt of juſtice, to clear injured innocence, to redeem from ſhame, her whom he loved. With eager haſte he told—that he had found
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:030623_0143_0FE83CE8E88FC618"/>
the mother, whoſe fall from virtue, Rebecca, overcome by confuſion and threats, had taken on herſelf.</p>
                     <p>Rebecca rejoiced—but her ſiſters ſhook their heads—and even the father ſeemed to doubt.</p>
                     <p>Confident in the truth of his ſtory, Henry perſiſted ſo boldly in his affirmations, that if Mr. Rymer did not entirely believe what he ſaid, he ſecretly hoped the dean and other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might; therefore he began to imagine, he could poſſibly ſhake from <hi>his</hi> family the preſent ſtigma, whether or no it belonged to any other.</p>
                     <p>No ſooner was Henry gone, than Mr. Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer waited on the dean to report what he had heard; and he frankly attributed his daughter's falſe confeſſion, to the compulſive methods he had adopted in charging her with the offence: upon this ſtatement, Henry's love to her was was alſo a ſolution of his inconſiſtent conduct on that ſingular occaſion.</p>
                     <p>The dean immediately ſaid—"he would put the matter beyond all doubt: for he would that moment ſend for the preſent reputed mother; and if ſhe acknowledged the child, he would inſtantly commit her to priſon for the attempt of putting it to death."</p>
                     <p>The curate applauded the dean's ſagacity; a warrant was iſſued; and Hannah brought pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner before the grandfather of her child.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="37" facs="unknown:030623_0144_0FE83D0B4EB1EEB0"/>
She appeared aſtoniſhed at the peril in which ſhe found herſelf! Confuſed alſo, with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand inexpreſſible ſenſations which the dean's preſence inſpired, ſhe ſeemed to prevaricate in all ſhe uttered.—Accuſed of this, ſhe was ſtill more diſconcerted—ſaid, and unſaid—confeſſed herſelf the mother of the infant, but declared ſhe did not know—then owned ſhe <hi>did</hi> know the name of the man who had undone her, but would never utter it.—At length, ſhe caſt her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on her knees before the father of her betrayer, and ſupplicated "he would not puniſh her with ſeverity, as ſhe moſt penitently confeſſed her fault, ſo far as it related to herſelf."</p>
                     <p>While Mr. and Mrs. Norwynne, juſt enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the honey-moon, were ſitting ſide by ſide enjoying with peace and with honour conjugal ſociety; poor Hannah, threatened, reviled, and ſinking to the duſt, was hearing from the mouth of William's father, the enormity of thoſe crimes to which his ſon had been acceſſary.—She ſaw the mittimus written that was to convey her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a priſon—ſaw herſelf delivered once more into the hands of conſtables, before her reſolution of concealing the name of William in her ſtory left her.—She now, overcome with affright, and thinking ſhe ſhould expoſe him ſtill more in a public court, if hereafter on her trial ſhe ſhould be obliged to name him—ſhe now humbly aſked

the dean to hear a few words ſhe had to ſay in private—where ſhe promiſed ſhe "would ſpeak nothing but the truth."</p>
                     <p>This was impoſſible, he ſaid—"No private confeſſions before a magiſtrate! All muſt be done openly."</p>
                     <p>She urged again and again the ſame requeſt—it was denied more peremptorily than at firſt.—On which ſhe ſaid,</p>
                     <p>"Then, Sir, forgive me, ſince you force me to it, if I ſpeak before Mr. Rymer and theſe men, what I would forever have kept a ſecret if I could. One of your family is my child's father."</p>
                     <p>"Any of my ſervants?" cried the dean.</p>
                     <p>"No."</p>
                     <p>"My nephew?"</p>

                     <p>"Come this way," ſaid the dean, "I <hi>will</hi> ſpeak to you in private."</p>
                     <p>It was not that the dean, as a magiſtrate, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed partial decrees of pretended juſtice—he was rigidly faithful to his truſt—he would not inflict puniſhment on the innocent, or let the guilty eſcape—but in all particulars of refined or coarſe treatment, he would alleviate or aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate according to the rank of the offender. He could not feel that a ſecret was of equal impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to a poor, as to a rich perſon—and while Hannah gave no intimation but that her delicacy

roſe from fears for herſelf, ſhe did not ſo forcibly impreſs the dean with an opinion that it was a caſe which had preſſing cauſe for a private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, as when ſhe boldly ſaid, "a part of <hi>his</hi> family, very near to him, was concerned in her tale."</p>
                     <p>The final reſult of their converſation in an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining room was—a charge from the dean, in the words of Mr. Rymer, "to huſh the affair up;" and his promiſe that the infant ſhould be immediately taken from her, and "ſhe ſhould have no more trouble with it."</p>
                     <p>"I have no trouble with it," replied Hannah. "It is now all my comfort: and I cannot part from it."</p>
                     <p>"Why, you inconſiſtent woman, did you not attempt to murder it?"</p>
                     <p>"That was before I had ſuckled it."</p>
                     <p>"It is neceſſary you ſhould give it up—it muſt be ſent ſome miles off—and then the whole circumſtance will be ſoon forgotten."</p>
                     <p>"<hi>I</hi> ſhall never forget it."</p>
                     <p>"No matter—you muſt give up the child—Do not moſt of our firſt women of quality part with their children?"</p>
                     <p>"Women of quality have other things to love—I have nothing elſe."</p>
                     <p>"And would you occaſion my ſon, and his

new-made bride, the ſhame and the uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—"</p>
                     <p>Here Hannah burſt into a flood of tears; and being angrily aſked by the dean "why ſhe blub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered ſo?"—</p>
                     <p>"I—have had ſhame and uneaſineſs," ſhe replied, wringing her hands.</p>
                     <p>"And you deſerve them—they are the ſure attendants of crimes ſuch as yours.—If you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured, and entrapped a young man like my ſon—"</p>
                     <p>"I am the youngeſt by five years," ſaid Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah.</p>
                     <p>"Well, well, repent;" returned the dean, "repent, and reſign your child. Repent, and you may yet marry an honeſt man who knows nothing of the matter."</p>
                     <p>"And repent too?" aſked Hannah.</p>
                     <p>Not the inſufferable ignorance of young Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, when he firſt came to England, was more vexatious or provoking to the dean than the ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic folly of poor Hannah's uncultured replies.—He at laſt, in an offended and determined manner, told her,</p>
                     <p>"That if ſhe would reſign the child, and keep the father's name a ſecret, not only the child ſhould be taken care of, but ſhe herſelf might, perhaps, receive ſome favours; but if ſhe perſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in her imprudent folly, ſhe muſt expect no

conſideration on her own account; nor ſhould ſhe be allowed, for the maintenance of the boy, a ſixpence beyond the ſtated ſum for a poor man's unlawful offspring. Hannah, reſolving not to be ſeparated from her infant, bowed reſignation to this laſt decree; and, terrified at the loud words and angry looks of the dean, after being regularly diſcharged, ſtole to her home; where the ſmiles of her infant, and the careſſes ſhe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed on it, repaid her for the ſorrows ſhe had juſt ſuffered for its ſake.</p>
                     <p>Let it here be obſerved, that the dean, on ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Hannah to depart without putting in force the law againſt her as he had threatened, did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, as it were, <hi>behind the curtain.</hi> He open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and candidly owned to Mr. Rymer, his clerk, and the two conſtables who were attending—"That an affair of ſome little gallantry, in which, he was extremely ſorry to ſay, his ſon was rather too nearly involved, required, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of his recent marriage, and an excellent young woman's (his bride's) happineſs, that it ſhould not be publicly talked of—Therefore he had thought proper only to reprimand the huſſey, and ſend her about her buſineſs."</p>
                     <p>The curate aſſured the dean—"That upon this, and upon all other occaſions, which ſhould, would, or <hi>could</hi> occur, he owed to his judgment, as his ſuperior, implicit obedience."</p>

                     <p>IT was not the pleaſure of a mother that Hannah experienced, which could make her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible to the ſorrow of a daughter.</p>
                     <p>Her parents had received the ſtranger child along with a fabricated tale ſhe told "of its appertaining to another," without the ſmalleſt ſuſpicion; but, by the ſecret diligence of the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and the nimble tongues of his elder daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the report of all that had paſſed on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this unfortunate infant, ſoon circulated through the village; and Hannah in a few weeks had ſeen her parents pine away in grief and ſhame at her loſs of virtue.</p>
                     <p>She perceived the neighbours avoid, or openly ſneer at <hi>her</hi>—but that was little—ſhe ſaw them ſlight her aged father and mother upon her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: and ſhe now took the reſolution rather to periſh for want in another part of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, than live where ſhe was known, and ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail a curſe on all who loved her. She ſlightly hoped, too, that by diſappearing from the town and neighbourhood, ſome little reward might be allowed her for her baniſhment by the dean's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:030623_0150_0FE83D20DA400FF0"/>

The dean and his family rejoined at her and her child's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture; but as this mode ſhe had choſen, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to be no ſpecified condition in the terms of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to her, they did not think they were bound to pay her for it; and while ſhe was too fearful and baſhful to ſolicit the dean, too proud (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn as ſhe was) to ſupplicate his ſon, they both concluded ſhe "wanted for nothing;" for to be poor, and too delicate to complain, they deemed incompatible.</p>
                     <p>To heighten the ſenſe of her degraded, friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſituation, ſhe knew that Henry had not been unmindful of his promiſe to her, but that he had applied to his couſin in her and his child's behalf; for he had acquainted her, that Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam's anſwer was—"all obligations on <hi>his</hi> part were now undertaken by his father; for Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah having choſen (in a fit of malignity upon his marriage) to appriſe the dean of their former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe, ſuch conduct had forever cancelled all attention due from him to her, or to her child, beyond what its bare maintenance exacted."</p>
                     <p>In vain had Henry explained to him the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament in which poor Hannah was involved before ſhe conſented to reveal her ſecret to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; William was happy in an excuſe to rid

He had unhappily found, that the ardour which had hurried him to vindicate the reputation of Rebecca, was likely to deprive him of the bleſſing of her ever becoming his wife. For the dean, chagrined that his ſon was at length proved an offender inſtead of his nephew, ſubmitted to the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of puniſhing the latter, while he forgave the former. He ſent for Henry, and having coldly congratulated him on his and Rebecca's inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, repreſented to him the impropriety of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the daughter of a poor curate, and laid his commands on him, "never to harbour ſuch an intention more." Henry found this reſtriction ſo ſevere that he would not promiſe obedience; but on his next attempt to viſit Rebecca, he met a poſitive repulſe from her father, who ſignified to him, "that the dean had forbid him to permit their farther acquaintance;" and the curate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared—"that, for his own part, he had no will,

                     <p>At the very time young Henry had received the propoſal from Mr. Rymer of his immediate union with his daughter, and the dean had made no objection, Henry waved the happineſs for the time preſent, and had given a reaſon why he wiſhed it poſtponed. The reaſon he then gave had its weight, but he had another concealed, of yet more import.—Much as he loved, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forward with rapture to that time when every morning, every evening, and all the day, he ſhould have the delight of Rebecca's ſociety; ſtill there was one other wiſh nearer his heart than this—one deſire which for years had been fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in his thoughts, and which not even love could eradicate. He longed, he pined to know what fate had befallen his father. Provided he were living, he could conceive no joy ſo extreme as that of ſeeing him! If he were dead, he was anxious to pay the tribute of filial piety he ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by ſatisfying his affectionate curioſity in every circumſtance of the ſad event.</p>
                     <p>While a boy, he had frequently expreſſed theſe ſentiments to both his uncle and his couſin: ſometimes they appriſed him of the total impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of accompliſhing his wiſhes: at other times, when they ſaw the diſappointment weigh heavy on his mind, they bade him—"wait till he

was a man, before he could hope to put his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns in execution." He did wait. But on the very day he arrived at the age of twenty-one, he made a vow—"that to gain intelligence of his father, ſhould be the firſt act of his free will."</p>
                     <p>Previouſly to this time he had made all the enquiries poſſible, whether any new adventure to that part of Africa in which he was bred, was likely to be undertaken. Of this there appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be no proſpect, till the intended expedition to Sierra Leone was announced, which favoured his hope of being able to procure a paſſage among thoſe adventurers, ſo near to the iſland on which his father was (or had been priſoner) as to obtain an opportunity of viſiting it by ſtealth.</p>
                     <p>Fearing contention, or the being diſſuaded from his plans if he communicated them, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them in private, kept them ſecretly; and his imagination filled with the kindneſs, the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the exceſs of fondneſs he had experienced from his father, beyond any other perſon in the world, he had thought with delight on the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from all his other kindred, to pay his duty to him, or to his revered memory. Of late in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, there had been an object introduced to his acquaintance, from whom it was bitter to part; but his deſigns had been planned and firmly fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before he knew Rebecca; nor could he have taſted contentment even with her, at the expence of his piety to his father.</p>

In the laſt interview he had with the dean, Henry—perceiving that his diſpoſition towards him was not leſs ſevere than when a few days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had ordered him on board a veſſel—found this the proper time to declare his intentions of accompanying the fleet to Sierra Leone.

                     <p>It was for Rebecca alone, to feel the loſs of Henry—it was for a mind like hers alone, to know his worth—nor did this laſt proof of it, the quitting her, for one who claimed by every tie a preference, leſſen him in her eſteem.—When, by a meſſage from him, ſhe became acquainted with his deſign, ſhe valued him the more for this obſervance of his duty, much as it interfered with her happineſs—the more ſhe regretted his loſs, and the more anxiouſly prayed for his return;

                     <p>BEFORE Henry could receive a reply to his letter, the fleet in which he ſailed put to ſea on the voyage.</p>

By his abſence, not only Rebecca was depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the friend ſhe loved, but poor Hannah loſt a kind and compaſſionate adviſer. Her parents, too, both ſickened, and both died, in a ſhort time after—and now, wholly friendleſs, and in her lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle exile where ſhe could only hope for tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not being known, ſhe was contending with ſuſpicion, rebuffs, diſappointments, and various other ills, that might have made the moſt harſh of her Anfield perſecutors feel compaſſion for her, could they have witneſſed the throbs of her heart, and have viewed the ſtate of her agoniſing mind.</p>
                     <p>Still, there are few perſons whom Providence afflicts, beyond the limits of <hi>all</hi> conſolation—few caſt ſo low, as not to feel pride on <hi>certain</hi> occaſions—and Hannah felt a comfort, and a dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the thought—that ſhe had both a mind and a body capable of ſuſtaining every hardſhip her deſtiny might inflict, rather than ſubmit to the diſgrace of ſoliciting William's charity a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time.</p>
                     <p>This determination was put to a variety of trials—In vain ſhe offered herſelf to the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of the village, in which ſhe was acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally caſt, as a ſervant—her child, her dejected looks, her broken ſentences, a wildneſs in her eye, a kind of bold deſpair, that at times ſpread over her features, her imperfect ſtory, who and
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:030623_0158_0FE83D6377A208F0"/>
what ſhe was, prejudiced all thoſe to whom ſhe applied; and, after thus travelling to ſeveral ſmall towns and hamlets, the only employer ſhe could obtain was a farmer, and the only employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to tend and feed his cattle, while his men were in the harveſt, tilling the ground, or at ſome other labour, which required, at that time, pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar expedition.</p>
                     <p>Though Hannah was born of peaſants, yet, having been an only child, and of induſtrious pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, ſhe had been nurſed with tenderneſs and delicacy, ill ſuited to her preſent occupation—but ſhe endured it with patience; and the moſt laborious part would have ſeemed light to her, could ſhe have diſmiſſed the reflection—what it was that had reduced her to it.</p>
                     <p>Soon her tender hands became hard and rough, her fair ſkin burnt and yellow; ſo that when, on a Sunday, ſhe has looked in the glaſs, ſhe has ſtarted back as if it were ſome other face ſhe ſaw inſtead of her own. But this loſs of beauty gave her no regret—while William did not ſee her, it was of little purport to her, whether ſhe were beautiful or hideous. On the features of her child only, ſhe now looked with joy—there, ſhe fancied ſhe ſaw William at every glance—and in the fond imagination, felt, at times, every hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs ſhort of ſeeing <hi>him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By herding ſolely with the brute creation, ſhe
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:030623_0159_0FE83DB68DFACFC8"/>
and her child were allowed to live together; and this was a ſtate ſhe preferred to the ſociety of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man creatures, who would have ſeparated her from what ſhe loved ſo tenderly.—Anxious to retain a place in which ſhe poſſeſſed ſuch a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, care and attention to her humble office cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her maſter to prolong her ſtay through all the the winter—then, during the ſpring, ſhe attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his yeaning ſheep—in the ſummer, watched them as they grazed—and thus ſeaſon after ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon paſſed, till her young ſon could afford her aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance in her daily work.</p>
                     <p>He now could charm her with his converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as well as with his looks—a thouſand times, in the tranſports of parental love, ſhe has preſſed him to her boſom, and thought with an agony of horror—on her foul intent to deſtroy, what was now ſo dear, ſo neceſſary to her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence.</p>
                     <p>Still the boy grew more like his father—in one reſemblance alone he failed.—He loved Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah with an affection totally diſtinct from the pitiful and childiſh gratification of his own ſelf-love—he never would quit her ſide for all the tempting offers of toys or money—never would eat of rarities given to him, till Hannah took a part—never croſſed her will, however contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to his own—never ſaw her ſmile that he did not laugh—nor did ſhe ever weep, but he wept too.</p>

                     <p>FROM the mean ſubject of oxen, ſheep, and peaſants, we return to perſonages—<hi>i. e.</hi> perſons of rank and fortune. The biſhop, who was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced in the laſt volume, but who occupied a very ſmall ſpace there, is now mentioned in this, merely that the reader may know, he is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the ſame ſtate as his writings—dying: and that his friend, the dean, is talked of as the moſt likely ſucceſſor to his dignified office.</p>
                     <p>The dean, moſt aſſuredly, had a ſtrong friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for the biſhop, and now, moſt aſſuredly, wiſhed him to recover—and yet—when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on the ſucceſs of his pamphlet a few years back, and of many which he had written ſince, on the very ſame ſubject, he could not but think, "That he had more righteous pretenſions to fill the vacant ſeat of his much beloved and reverend friend (ſhould fate ordain it to be vacated) than any other man:" and he knew—that it would not take one moment from that friends remaining life, ſhould he exert himſelf, and with all due management, to obtain the elevated ſtation when <hi>he</hi> ſhould be no more.</p>
                     <p>In preſuppoſing the death of a friend, the dean—like many other virtuous men—"always ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed him going to a better place." With per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect reſignation, therefore, he waited whatever
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:030623_0161_0FE83E3E1E43E108"/>
change might happen to the biſhop; ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him with open arms if he recovered, or equally ready, in caſe of his diſſolution, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his dignities.</p>
                     <p>Lady Clementina diſplayed her ſenſibility and feeling for the ſick prelate, by the diſguſting ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance of hyſteric fits; except at thoſe times when ſhe talked ſeriouſly with her huſband upon the injuſtice which ſhe thought would be done to him, and to his many pamphlets and ſermons, if he did not immediately riſe to the epiſcopal ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
                     <p>"Surely, dean," ſaid ſhe, "ſhould you be diſappointed upon this occaſion, you will write no more books for the good of your country?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes I will," he replied, "but the next book I write for the good of my country ſhall be very different, nay the very reverſe of thoſe I have already written."</p>
                     <p>"How, dean! would you ſhow yourſelf changed?"</p>
                     <p>"No, but I will ſhow that my country is changed."</p>
                     <p>"What! ſince you produced your laſt work? only ſix weeks ago!"</p>
                     <p>"Great changes may occur in ſix days;" re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the dean, with a threatening accent: "and if I find things <hi>have</hi> taken a new and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper turn, I will be the firſt to expoſe it."</p>

                     <p>WHILE the biſhop and his ſon were ſailing before proſperous gales on the ocean of life, young Henry was contending with adverſe winds, and many other perils on the watery ocean—yet ſtill, his diſtreſſes and dangers were leſs, than thoſe which Hannah had to encounter on land. The ſea threatens an untimely death; the ſhore menaces calamities from which death is a refuge.</p>
                     <p>The afflictions Hannah had already experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, could juſt admit of aggravation—the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion occurred.</p>
                     <p>Had the good farmer, who made her the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of his ſtocks and herds, lived till now, till now ſhe might have been ſecure from the annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of human kind: but, thrown once more upon ſociety, ſhe was unfit to ſuſtain the conflict of decorum againſt depravity.—Her maſter, her patron, her preſerver, was dead; and hardly as
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:030623_0163_0FE83D94565BB588"/>
ſhe had earned the pittance ſhe received from him, ſhe found, it ſurpaſſed all her power to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the like again. Her doubtful character, her capacious mind, her unmethodical manners, were ſtill ill ſuited to the nice preciſion of a country houſewife; and as the prudent miſtreſs of a family ſneered at her pretenſions, ſhe, in her turn, ſcorned at the narrow minded miſtreſs of a family.</p>
                     <p>In her enquiries how to gain her bread free from the cutting reproaches of diſcretion, ſhe was informed "that London was the only pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate corner where guilt could be ſecreted undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed—and the only public place where in open day, it might triumphantly ſtalk, attended by a train of audacious admirers."</p>
                     <p>There was a charm to the ear of Hannah, in the name of London, that thrilled through her ſoul—William lived in London—and ſhe thought, that while ſhe retired to ſome dark cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar with her offences, he probably would ride in ſtate with his, and ſhe at humble diſtance might ſometimes catch a glance of him.</p>
                     <p>As difficult as to eradicate inſanity from a mind once poſſeſſed, ſo difficult it is to eraſe from the lover's breaſt, the deep impreſſion of a <hi>real</hi> affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Coercion may prevail for a ſhort interval, ſtill love will rage again. Not all the ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Hannah experienced in the place where ſhe
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:030623_0164_0FE83D8D23D5DFB8"/>
now was without a home—not the hunger which ſhe at time ſuffered, and even at times ſaw her child endure—not every inducement for for going to London, or motive for quitting her preſent deſolate ſtation, had the weight to affect her choice ſo much as—in London, ſhe ſhould live nearer William; in the preſent ſpot ſhe could never hope to ſee him again; but there ſhe might chance to paſs him in the ſtreets; ſhe might paſs his door unobſerved every day; might enquire about him of his inferior neighbours, who would be unſuſpious of the cauſe of her curioſity. For theſe gratifications ſhe ſhould breathe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther air—for theſe, ſhe could bear all hardſhips which London threatened; and for theſe, ſhe took a three weeks' journey to that perilous town on foot, cheering, as ſhe walked along, her innocent and wearied companion.</p>
                     <p>William! In your luxurious dwelling! Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of coffers filled with gold! Relations, friends, clients, joyful around you! Delicious viands and rich wines upon your ſumptuous board! Voluptuouſneſs diſplayed in every apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your habitation!—Contemplate, for a moment, Hannah, your firſt love, with her ſon, your firſt, and only child, walking through froſt and ſnow to London, with a foreboding fear on the mother—that they both may periſh for the want of a friend when arrived.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="58" facs="unknown:030623_0165_0FE83CCF106B2000"/>
But no ſooner did Hannah find herſelf within the ſmoke of the metropolis, than the old charm was renewed, and ſcarcely had ſhe refreſhed her child at the poor inn at which ſhe ſtopped, than ſhe enquired—how far it was to that part of the town where ſhe knew William reſided.</p>
                     <p>She received for anſwer, "about two miles."</p>
                     <p>Upon this information, ſhe thought ſhe would keep in reſerve, till ſome new ſorrow befell her, the conſolation of paſſing his door, (perchance of ſeeing him) which muſt ever be an alleviation of her grief. It was not long before ſhe had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for even more ſubſtantial comfort. She ſoon found ſhe was not likely to obtain a ſervice here, more than in the country. Some objected that ſhe could not make caps and gowns; ſome, that ſhe could not preſerve and pickle; ſome, that ſhe was too young; ſome, that ſhe was too pretty; and all declined accepting her, till at laſt a citizen's wife, on condition of her receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but half the wages uſually given, took her as a ſervant of all work.</p>
                     <p>In romances, and in ſome plays, there are ſcenes of dark and unwholeſome mines, wherein the labourer works during the brighteſt day by the aid of artificial light. There are in London kitchens equally diſmal, though not quite ſo much expoſed to damp and noxious vapours. In one of theſe, under ground, hid from the cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:030623_0166_0FE83E4687AC14B0"/>
light of the ſun, poor Hannah was doomed to toil from morning till night, ſubjected to the command of a diſſatisfied miſtreſs; who, not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating as ſhe ought, the miſery incurred by ſerving her, conſtantly threatened her ſervants "with a diſmiſſion;" at which the unthinking wretches would tremble merely from the ſound of the words—for, to have reflected—to have conſidered what their purport was—"to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed from a dungeon, relieved from continual upbraidings, and vile drudgery," muſt have been a ſubject of rejoicing—and yet, becauſe theſe good tidings were delivered as a menace, cuſtom had made the poor creatures fearful of the conſequence. So, death being deſcribed to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren as a diſaſter, even poverty and ſhame will ſtart from it with affright; when, had it been pictured (as it is) a good, it would be feared by few, and many, many would welcome it with gladneſs.</p>
                     <p>All the care of Hannah to pleaſe, her fear of offending, her toilſome days, her patience, her ſubmiſſion, could not prevail on her miſtreſs to retain her one hour after by chance ſhe had heard, "that Hannah was the mother of a child; that ſhe wiſhed it ſhould be kept a ſecret; and that ſhe ſtole out now and then to viſit him."</p>
                     <p>Hannah, with ſwimming eyes and an almoſt breaking heart, left a place—where, to have

lived one hour, would have plunged any fine lady in the deepeſt grief.</p>

                     <p>HANNAH was driven from ſervice to ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice—her deficiency in the knowledge of a mere drudge, or her loſt character, purſued her where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhe went; and at length, becoming wholly deſtitute, ſhe gladly accepted a place where the latter misfortune was not the leaſt objection.</p>
                     <p>In one of thoſe habitations where continual miſery is dreſſed in continual ſmiles; where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme of poverty is concealed by extreme of ſhow; where wine diſpenſes mirth only by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing forgetfulneſs; and where female beauty is ſo cheap, ſo complying, that while it inveigles it diſguſts the man of pleaſure;—in one of thoſe houſes, to attend upon its wretched inhabitants, Hannah was hired.—Her feelings of rectitude ſubmitted to thoſe of hunger—Her principles of virtue (which the loſs of virtue had not deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) received a ſhock when ſhe engaged to be the abettor of vice, from which her delicacy, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, and religion ſhrunk: but—perſons of honour and of reputation would not employ her: was ſhe then to periſh? That perhaps was eaſy to reſolve—but ſhe had a child to leave behind! A child, from whom to part for a day was a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:030623_0168_0FE83D83162766E8"/>
—Yet, before ſhe ſubmitted herſelf to a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation that filled her mind with a kind of loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing horror, often ſhe paced up and down the ſtreet in which William lived, looked wiſtfully at his houſe, and ſometimes, loſt to all her finer feelings of independent pride, thought of ſending a ſhort petition to him—but, at the idea of a repulſe, and of that frowning brow, which ſhe knew William <hi>could</hi> dart on her, ſhe preferred death, or the moſt degrading life, to the trial.</p>
                     <p>It was long ſince, that misfortune and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour had made her callous to the good or ill opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of all the world, except <hi>his;</hi> and the fear of drawing upon her his encreaſed contempt, was ſtill, at the criſis of applying, ſo powerful, that ſhe ſound ſhe dared not even hazard a reproof from him in the perſon of his father; whoſe ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour ſhe had now more than once experienced, in the frequent harſh meſſages conveyed to her with the poor ſtipend for her boy.</p>
                     <p>Awed by the rigid and pious character of the new biſhop, the riſing honours and growing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of his ſon, ſhe miſtook the appearance of moral excellence, for moral excellence itſelf; and felt her own unworthyneſs even to become the ſupplicant of thoſe great men.</p>
                     <p>Day after day ſhe watched thoſe parts of the town through which William's chariot was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to drive—but, to ſee the carriage was
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:030623_0169_0FE83DBD57FFAD40"/>
all to which ſhe aſpired—a feeling, not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, forced her to caſt her eyes upon the earth as it drew near to her—and when it had paſſed, ſhe beat her breaſt and wept, that ſhe had not ſeen <hi>him.</hi>

                     <p>Impreſſed with the ſuperiority of others, and her own abject and diſguſtful ſtate, ſhe cried—"Let me herd with thoſe who won't deſpiſe me—let me only ſee faces whereon I can look without confuſion and terror—let me aſſociate with wretches like myſelf, rather than force my ſhame before thoſe who are ſo good, they can but ſcorn and mock at me."</p>
                     <p>With a mind thus languiſhing for ſympathy in diſgrace, ſhe entered a ſervant in the houſe juſt now deſcribed. There, accompliſhing the fatal proverb againſt "<hi>evil communications,</hi>" ſhe had not the fortitude to be an exception to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rule—That pliant diſpoſition which had yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the licentious love of William, ſtooped to ſtill baſer proſtitution in company ſtill more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved.</p>
                     <p>At firſt ſhe ſhuddered at thoſe practices that ſhe ſaw, at thoſe converſations that ſhe heard; and bleſt herſelf that poverty, not inclination, had cauſed her to be a witneſs of ſuch things, and had condemned her in the vile abode to be a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, rather, than in the lower rank of miſtreſs. Uſe ſoftened thoſe horrors every day—at length
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:030623_0170_0FE83E1ADB169DB8"/>
ſelf-defence, the fear of ridicule, and the hope of favour, induced her to adopt that very conduct from which her heart revolted.</p>
                     <p>In her ſorrowful countenance, and fading charms, there yet remained attraction for many viſitors—and ſhe now ſubmitted to the merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary profanations of love; more odious, as her mind had been ſubdued by its moſt ſacred and endearing joys.</p>
                     <p>While inceſſant regret whiſpered to her "ſhe ought to have endured every calamity rather than this," ſhe thus queſtioned her nice ſenſe of wrong—"Why, why reſpect myſelf, while no other reſpects me? Why ſet a value on my own feelings, when no one elſe does?"</p>
                     <p>Degraded in her own judgment, ſhe doubted her own underſtanding when it ſometimes told her ſhe had deſerved better treatment—for ſhe felt herſelf a fool in compariſon with her learned ſeducer, and the reſt who deſpiſed her. "And why," ſhe continued, "ſhould I ungratefully perſiſt to contemn women, who alone are ſo kind as to accept me a companion? Why re-refuſe conformity to their cuſtoms, while none of my ſex beſides, will admit me to their ſociety a partaker of theirs?"</p>
                     <p>In ſpeculation theſe arguments appeared rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and ſhe purſued their dictates—but in the practice of the life in which ſhe plunged, ſhe
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:030623_0171_0FE7ECF6B74C6AF8"/>
proved the fallacy of the ſyſtem; and at times tore her hair with frantic ſorrow—that ſhe did not continue in the mid-way of guilt, and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſome little portion of ſelf-approbation, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe her, in a ſmall degree, for the total loſs of the eſteem of all the virtuous world.</p>
                     <p>But ſhe had now gone too far to recede.—Could ſhe have now recalled her innocence, even that part ſhe brought with her to London, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience would have taught her to have given up her child, and have lived once more with the brute creation, and apart from him, rather than to have mingled with her preſent ſociety. Now, alas! the time for flying was paſt—all prudent choice was over—even all reflection was gone for ever—or only admitted on compulſion, when it imperiouſly forced its way amidſt the ſcenes of tumultuous mirth, of licentious paſſion, of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted not, ſhameleſs effrontery, and wild in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxication—when it <hi>would</hi> force its way—even through the walls of a brothel.</p>

                     <p>IS there a reader ſo little experienced in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man heart, ſo forgetful of his own as not to feel the poſſibility of the following fact?</p>
                     <p>A ſeries of uncommon calamities had been for many years the lot of the elder Henry—a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:030623_0172_0FE7ED0CF06C7FE8"/>
of proſperous events had fallen to the ſhare of his brother William—The one was the envy, while the other had the compaſſion of all who thought about them. For the laſt twenty years William had lived in affluence, bordering upon ſplendour, his friends, his fame, his fortune daily encreaſing; while Henry, throughout that very period, had, by degrees, loſt all he loved on earth, and was now exiſting apart from civiliz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſociety—and yet—during thoſe twenty years, where William knew one happy moment, Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry taſted hundreds.</p>
                     <p>That the ſtate of the mind, and not outward circumſtances, is the nice point on which happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs depends, is but a quaint remark: but that intellectual power ſhould have the force to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a man diſcontented in extraordinary proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſuch as that of the preſent biſhop, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented in his brother's extreme of adverſity, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires illuſtration.</p>
                     <p>The firſt great affliction to Henry was his brother's ingratitude; but reaſoning on the frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of man's nature, and the power of man's temptations, he found excuſes for William, which made him ſupport the treatment he had received with more tranquillity, than William's proud mind ſupported his brother's marriage—Henry's indulgent diſpoſition made him leſs angry with William, than William was with him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="66" facs="unknown:030623_0173_0FE83DD82639CFF8"/>
The next affliction Henry ſuffered, was the loſs of his beloved wife—that was a grief which time and change of objects gradually alleviated; while William's wiſe was a permanent grief to him; her puerile mind, her talking vanity, her affected virtues ſoured his domeſtic comfort; and, in time, he had ſuffered more painful mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from her ſociety, than his brother had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, even from the death of her he loved.</p>
                     <p>In their children, indeed, William was the happieſt—his ſon was a pride and pleaſure to him, while Henry never thought upon <hi>his</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out lamenting his loſs with bittereſt anguiſh.—But if the elder brother had, in this inſtance, the advantage, ſtill Henry had a reſource to overba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance this article. Henry, as he lay impriſoned in his dungeon, and when, after his puniſhment was remitted, he was again allowed to wander and ſeeek his ſubſiſtance where he would; in all his tedious walks and ſolitary reſting-places, during all his lonely days and mournful nights, had <hi>this reſource</hi> to conſole him:</p>
                     <p>"I never did an injury to any one: never was harſh, ſevere, unkind, deceitful: I did not mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confine myſelf to do my neighbour no harm; I ſtrove to ſerve him."</p>
                     <p>This was the reſource that cheered his ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart amidſt gloomy deſerts and a barbarous people; lulled him to peaceful ſlumber in the
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:030623_0174_0FE83E2B71C17128"/>
but of a ſavage hunter, and in the ſound of the lion's roar; at times impreſſed him with a ſenſe of happineſs; and made him contemplate, with a longing hope, the retribution of a future world.</p>
                     <p>The biſhop, with all his comforts, had no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort like this—he had <hi>his</hi> ſolitary reflections too, but they were of a tendency the reverſe of theſe. "I uſed my brother ill," was a ſecret thought of moſt powerful influence—it kept him waking upon his ſafe and commodious bed; was ſure to recur with every misfortune by which he was threatened, to make his fears ſtill ſtronger; and came, with invidious ſtabs, upon every ſucceſsful event, to take from him a part of his joy.—In a word, it was <hi>conſcience</hi> that made Henry's years paſs happier than William's.</p>
                     <p>But though, comparatively with his brother, William was the leſs happy man, yet his ſelf-reproach was not of ſuch magnitude, for an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of that attrocious nature, as to baniſh a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain degree of happineſs, and a ſenſibility to the ſmiles of fortune from his breaſt—nor was Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's ſelf-acquittal of ſuch exquiſite kind as to chaſe away the feeling of his deſolate ſitua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">

                     <p>As he fiſhed or hunted for his daily dinner, many a time in full view of his prey, a ſudden burſt of ſorrow at his fate, a ſudden longing for ſome dear ſociety, for ſome friend to ſhare his thoughts, for ſome kind ſhoulder on which to
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:030623_0175_0FE83CC4F3EA5820"/>
lean his head, for ſome companion to partake of his repaſt, would make him inſtantaneouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt from his purſuit, caſt him on the ground in a fit of anguiſh, till a ſhower of tears, and his <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> came to his relief.</p>
                     <p>It was on a ſultry morning, when, after plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant dreams during the night, he had waked with more than uſual perception of his miſery; that, ſitting upon the beach, his wiſhes and his looks all bent on the ſea towards his native land, he thought he ſaw a ſail ſwelling before an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected breeze.</p>
                     <p>"Sure I am dreaming ſtill!" he cried. "This is the very veſſel I ſaw laſt night in my ſleep!—Oh! what cruel mockery, that my eyes ſhould ſo deceive me!"</p>
                     <p>Yet, though he doubted, he leaped upon his feet in tranſport!—held up his hands, ſtretched at their length, in a kind of extatic joy!—and, as the glorious ſight approached, was near ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the ſea to meet it.</p>
                     <p>For a while, hope and fear kept him in a ſtate bordering on diſtraction.</p>

appeared more than ever frightful!—Inevitable afflictions muſt be borne; but that calamity which admits the expectation of relief, that is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards denied, is inſupportable.</p>
                     <p>After a few minutes paſſed in dreadful uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, which enhanced the wiſhed-for happineſs, the ſhip evidently drew near the land—a boat was launched from her—and while Henry, now upon his knees, wept, and prayed fervently for the event, a youth ſprang from the barge on the ſtrand, ruſhed towards him, and falling on his neck, then at his feet, exclaimed—"My father! oh! my father!"</p>

<pb n="70" facs="unknown:030623_0177_0FE83E4D47C08AF8"/>
though living, was ſo changed in perſon, that his ſon would ſcarcely have known him in any other than the favourite ſpot, which the younger (keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in memory every incident of his former life) knew his father had always choſen for his morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contemplations; and where, previouſly to his coming to England, he had many a time kept him company. It was to that particular corner of the iſland that the captain of the ſhip had generouſly ordered they ſhould ſteer, out of the general route, to gratify the filial tenderneſs he expreſſed. But ſcarcely had the interview be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the father and ſon taken place, than a band of natives, whom the appearance of the veſſel had called from the woods and hills, came to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack the invaders. The elder Henry had no friend with whom he wiſhed to ſhake hands at his departure; the old negro ſervant who had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in young Henry's eſcape was dead; and he experienced the exceſſive joy of bidding adieu to a place, without one regret for all he left behind.</p>
                     <p>On the night of that day, whoſe morning had been marſted by peculiar ſadneſs, at the louring proſpect of many exiled years to come; he ſlept on board an Engliſh veſſel, with Engliſhmen his companions, and his ſon, his beloved ſon—who was ſtill more dear to him for that mind which had planned and executed his reſcue—his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſervant, and moſt affectionate friend.</p>

the very counterpart of his father's; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no child to create affection to his home, his ſtudy was the only relief from the domeſtic in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrance, his wife: and though by unremit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting application their (joined to the influence of the potent relations of the woman he hated) he at length arrived at the ſummit of his ambitious deſires, ſtill they poorly repaid him, for the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice he had made in early life, of every tender diſpoſition.</p>

                     <p>The time of the aſſizes, at the county-town in which ſhe is impriſoned, is arrived—the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners are demanded at the ſhire-hall—the jail doors are opened—they go in ſad proceſſion.—The trumpet ſounds—it ſpeaks the arrival of the judge—and that judge is William.</p>
                     <p>The day previous to her trial, Hannah had read, in the printed calendar of the priſoners, his name, as the learned juſtice before whom ſhe was to appear. For a moment ſhe forgot her perilous ſtate in the exceſs of joy, which the ſtill unconquerable love ſhe bore to him, permitted her to taſte even on the brink of the grave!—After-reflection made her check thoſe worldly tranſports, as unfit for the preſent ſolemn occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But alas! to her, earth and William were ſo cloſely united, that, till ſhe forſook the

                     <p>Now fear took place of her firſt immoderate joy—ſhe feared, that although much changed in perſon ſince he had ſeen her, and her real name now added to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>In meditations ſuch as theſe ſhe paſſed the ſleepleſs night.</p>
                     <p>When, in the morning, ſhe was brought to the bar, and her guilty hand held up before the righteous judgment-ſeat of William; imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could not form two figures, or two ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

more incompatible with the exiſtence of former familiarity, than the judge and the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prit—and yet, theſe very perſons had paſſed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the moſt bliſsful moments that either ever taſted!—Thoſe hours of tender dalliance were now preſent to <hi>her</hi> mind—<hi>His</hi> thoughts were more more nobly employed in his high office—nor could the haggard face, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>She heard herſelf arraigned with trembling limbs and downcaſt looks—and many witneſſes had appeared againſt her, before ſhe ventured to lift her eyes up to her awful judge.—She then gave one fearful glance, and diſcovered William, unpitying, but beloved William, in every fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feature! It was a face ſhe had been uſed to look on with delight, and a kind of abſent ſmile of gladneſs, now beamed on her poor wan viſage.</p>
                     <p>When every witneſs on the part of the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor had been examined, the judge addreſſed himſelf to her,</p>
                     <p>"What defence have you to make?"</p>
                     <p>It was William ſpoke to Hannah!—The ſound was ſweet—the voice was mild, was ſoft, compaſſionate, encouraging!—It almoſt charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                     <p>She could have hung upon the preſent words for ever! She did not call to mind that this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs was the effect of practice, the art of his occupation: which at times, is but a copy, by the unfeeling, from his benevolent brothers of the bench.—In the preſent judge, tenderneſs was not deſigned for the culprit's conſolation, but for the approbation of the auditors.</p>
                     <p>There were no ſpectators, Hannah, by your ſide when laſt he parted from you—if there had, the awful William had been awed to marks of pity.</p>
                     <p>Stunned with the enchantment of that well-known tongue directed to her, ſhe ſtood like one juſt petrified—all vital power was ſuſpended.</p>
                     <p>Again he put the queſtion, and with theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional ſentences, tenderly and emphatically de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered—"Recollect yourſelf—Have you no witneſſes? No proof in your behalf?"</p>
                     <p>A dead ſilence followed theſe queſtions.</p>
                     <p>He then mildly, but forcibly, added—"What have you to ſay?"</p>
                     <p>Here, a flood of tears burſt from her eyes, which ſhe fixed earneſtly upon him, as if plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for mercy, while ſhe faintly articulated,</p>
                     <p>"Nothing, my Lord."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="79" facs="unknown:030623_0186_0FE83E02679F6308"/>
After a ſhort pauſe, he aſked her, in the ſame forcible but benevolent tone,</p>
                     <p>"Have you no one to ſpeak for your charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?"</p>
                     <p>The priſoner anſwered,</p>
                     <p>"No."</p>
                     <p>A ſecond guſh of tears followed this reply, for ſhe called to mind by <hi>whom,</hi> her character had firſt been blaſted.</p>
                     <p>He ſummed up the evidence—and every time he was compelled to preſs hard upon the proofs againſt her, ſhe ſhrunk, and ſeemed to ſtagger with the deadly blow—writhed under the weight of <hi>his</hi> minute juſtice, more than from the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of a ſhameful death.</p>
                     <p>The jury conſulted but a few minutes—the verdict was—</p>
                     <p>"Guilty."</p>
                     <p>She heard it with compoſure.</p>
                     <p>But when William placed the fatal velvet on his head, and roſe to pronounce her ſentence—ſhe ſtarted with a kind of convulſive motion—retrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a ſtep or two back, and lifting up her hands, with a ſcream exclaimed—</p>
                     <p>"Oh! not from <hi>you!</hi>"</p>
                     <p>The piercing ſhriek which accompanied theſe words, prevented their being heard by part of the audience; and thoſe who heard them, thought little of their meaning, more, than that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed her fear of dying.</p>

                        <pb n="80" facs="unknown:030623_0187_0FE83DA62CAAC8B0"/>
Serene, and dignified, as if no ſuch exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had been uttered, William delivered the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſpeech, ending with—"Dead, dead, dead."</p>
                     <p>She fainted as he cloſed the period, and was carried back to priſon in a ſwoon; while he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed the court to go to dinner.</p>

                     <p>IF, unaffected by the ſcene he had witneſſed, William ſat down to dinner with an appetite, let not the reader conceive, that the moſt diſtant idea had ſtruck his mind—of his ever having ſeen, much leſs familiarly known, the poor offender whom he had juſt condemned. Still this forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs did not proceed from the want of memory for Hannah—In every peeviſh or heavy hour paſſed with his wife, he was ſure to think of her—yet, it was ſelf-love, rather than love of <hi>her,</hi> that gave riſe to theſe thoughts—he felt the want of female ſympathy and tenderneſs, to ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the fatigue of ſtudious labour; to ſoothe a ſullen, a moroſe diſpoſition—he felt he wanted comfort for himſelf, but never once conſidered what Hannah's wants were.</p>
                     <p>In the chagrin of a barren bed, he ſometimes thought, too, even on the child that Hannah bore him; but whether it were male or female, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a beggar in the ſtreets, or dead—various
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:030623_0188_0FE83D2BF64D9C80"/>
and important public occupations, forbade him to waſte time to enquire. Yet the poor, the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and the orphan, frequently ſhared Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam's oſtentatious bounty. He was the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of many excellent charities; gave largely; and ſometimes inſtituted benevolent ſocieties for the unhappy: for he delighted to load the poor with obligations, and the rich with praiſe.</p>
                     <p>There are perſons like him, who love to do every good, but that which their immediate duty requires—There are ſervants who will ſerve every one more cheerfully than their maſters—There are men who will diſtribute money libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to all, except their creditors—And there are wives who will love any man better than their huſbands.—<hi>Duty</hi> is a familiar word which has little effect upon an ordinary mind: and as ordinary minds are in a vaſt majority, we have acts of generoſity, valour, ſelf-denial, and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, where ſmaller pains would conſtitute greater virtues.—Had William followed the <hi>common</hi> dictates of charity; had he adopted private pity, inſtead of public munificence: had he caſt an eye at home, before he ſought abroad for objects of compaſſion, Hannah had been preſerved from an ignominious death, and he had been preſerved from—<hi>remorſe:</hi> the tortures of which, he for the firſt time proved, on reading a printed ſheet of paper thrown accidentally in his way, a few

                     <p>"He pined away ever ſince his mother was confined, and died two days after her execution."</p>
                     <p>Robbed, by this news, of his only gleam of conſolation—in the conſciouſneſs of having done a mortal injury, for which he never now, by any means could atone—he ſaw all his honours, all his riches, all his proud ſelfiſh triumphs dance before him! They ſeemed like airy nothings, which in rapture he would exchange for the peace of a tranquil conſcience!</p>
                     <p>He envied Hannah the death to which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, then condemned her—He envied her even the life ſhe ſtruggled through from his neglect—and felt, that his future days would be far leſs happy, than her former exiſtence.

                     <p>THE progreſſive riſe of William, and fall of Hannah, had now occupied nearly the term of
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:030623_0195_0FE83DF9F3E3BCB8"/>
of eighteen years—added to theſe, another year elapſed before the younger Henry completed the errand on which his heart was fixed. Shipwreck, impriſonment, and ills to which the poor and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friended traveller is peculiarly expoſed, detained the father and ſon in various remote regions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the preſent period; and for the laſt fifteen years, denied them the means of all correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with their own country.</p>
                     <p>The elder Henry was now paſt ſixty years of age, and the younger almoſt beyond the prime of life. Still length of time had not diminiſhed, but rather had increaſed their anxious longings for their native home.</p>
                     <p>The ſorrows, diſappointments, and fatigues that throughout theſe tedious years were endur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the two Henrys, are of that dull monoto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous kind of ſuffering, better omitted than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed: mere repetitions of the exile's woe, that ſhall give place to the tranſporting joy, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from baniſhment!—Yet, much as the younger had reckoned with impatient wiſhes, the hours that were paſſed diſtant from her he loved, no ſooner was his diſaſtrous voyage at an end, and his feet trod upon the ſhores of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, than a thouſand wounding fears made him almoſt doubt, whether it were happineſs or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery he had obtained by his arrival. If Rebecca were living, he knew it muſt be happineſs—for
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:030623_0196_0FE83D1AC3492408"/>
his heart dwelt with confidence on her faith—her unchanging ſentiments. "But death might poſſibly have raviſhed from his hopes what no mortal power could have done." And thus the lover creates a rival in every ill, rather than ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his fears to remain inanimate.</p>
                     <p>The elder Henry had leſs to fear or to hope than his ſon—yet he both feared and hoped with a ſenſibility that gave him inexpreſſible anxiety. He hoped his brother would receive him with kindneſs, after his long abſence, and once more take his ſon cordially to his favour. He longed impatiently to behold his brother; to ſee his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew; nay, in the ardour of the renewed affection he juſt now felt, he thought even a diſtant view of Lady Clementina would be grateful to his ſight! But ſtill, well remembering the pomp, the ſtate, the pride of William, he could not rely on <hi>his</hi> affection, ſo much he knew that it depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on external circumſtances to excite, or to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh his love. Not that he feared an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute repulſion from his brother; but he feared, what, to a delicate mind, is ſtill worſe—Reſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed manners, cold looks, abſent ſentences, and all the cruel retinue of indifference, with which thoſe who are beloved, ſo often wound the boſom that adores them.</p>
                     <p>By enquiring of their countrymen (whom they met as they approached to the end of their
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:030623_0197_0FE7ECFEE41AC858"/>
voyage) concerning their relation, the dean, the two Henrys learned that he was well, and had for ſome years paſt been exalted to the biſhopric of * * *. This news gave them joy, while it encreaſed their fear of not receiving a familiar welcome.</p>
                     <p>The younger Henry, on his landing, wrote immediately to his uncle, acquainting him with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> father's arrival in the moſt abject ſtate of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty: he addreſſed his letter to the biſhop's country reſidence, where he knew, as it was the ſummer ſeaſon, he would certainly be: He and his father then ſet off on foot, towards that reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence—a palace!</p>
                     <p>The biſhop's palace was not ſituated above fifty miles from the port where they had landed: and at a ſmall inn about three miles from the biſhop's, they propoſed (as the letter to him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated) to wait for his anſwer, before they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded into his preſence.</p>
                     <p>At the town where they came on ſhore, and as they walked on their journey, though it was ſomewhat ſolitary, that they knew no creature whom they met or ſaw, yet it was no ſmall conſolation, that no creature knew them.</p>
                     <p>"To be poor and ragged, father," the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer ſmilingly ſaid, "is no diſgrace, no ſhame, thank heaven, where the object is not known."</p>
                     <p>"True, my ſon," replied Henry, "and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:030623_0198_0FE83E5E2CE54558"/>
I feel myſelf much happier now, unknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and unknown to all but you, than I ſhall in the preſence of my fortunate brother and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily: for there, confuſion at my ill ſucceſs through life, may give me greater pain, than even my misfortunes have inflicted."</p>
                     <p>After uttering this reflection that had preyed upon his mind, he ſat down on the road ſide to reſt his diſcomfited limbs, before he could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed farther. His ſon reaſoned with him; gave him courage; and now his hopes preponderated; till after two day's journey, on arriving at the inn where an anſwer from the biſhop was expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, no letter, no meſſage had been left.</p>
                     <p>"He means to renounce us," ſaid Henry, trembling and whiſpering to his ſon.</p>
                     <p>Without diſcloſing to the people of the houſe who they were, or from whom the letter or the meſſage they enquired for was to have come, they retired, and conſulted what ſteps they were now to purſue.</p>
                     <p>Previouſly to his writing to the biſhop, the younger Henry's heart, all his inclinations, had ſwayed him towards a viſit to the village in which was his uncle's former country ſeat—the beloved village of Anfield—but, reſpect and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to him had made him check thoſe wiſhes—now, they revived again—and with the image of Rebecca before his eyes, he warmly entreated
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:030623_0199_0FE83E57281FF130"/>
his father to go with him to Anfield, at preſent only thirty miles diſtance, and from thence, write once more—then wait the will of his uncle.</p>
                     <p>The father conſented to this propoſal, even glad to poſtpone the viſit to his dignified brother.</p>
                     <p>After a ſcanty repaſt, ſuch as they had been long innured to, they quitted the inn, and took the road towards Anfield.</p>

                     <p>IT was about five in the afternoon of a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's day, that Henry and his ſon left the ſign of the Mermaid, and began their third <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: the young man's ſpirits elated with the proſpect of the reception he ſhould meet from Rebecca; the elder dejected, at not receiving a welcome from his brother.</p>
                     <p>The road which led to Anfield neceſſarily took our travellers within ſight of the biſhop's palace—the turrets appeared at a diſtance—and on the ſudden turn round the corner of a large plantation, the whole magnificent ſtructure was at once exhibited, before his brother's aſtoniſhed eyes! He was ſtruck with the grandeur of the habitation—and, totally forgetting all the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, the contemptuous treatment he had ever received from its owner (like the ſame Henry in
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:030623_0200_0FE83E790113C1C0"/>
his earlier years) ſmiled with a kind of tranſport "that William was ſo great a man."</p>
                     <p>After this firſt joyous ſenſation was over, "Let us go a little nearer, my ſon," ſaid he, "no one will ſee us I hope: or if they ſhould, you can run and conceal yourſelf; and not a creature will know <hi>me</hi>—even my brother would not know me thus altered—and I wiſh to take a little farther view of his fine houſe, and all his pleaſure grounds.</p>
                     <p>Young Henry, though impatient to be gone, would not object to his father's deſire.—They walked forward between a ſhady grove and a curling rivulet, ſnuffed in odours from the jeſſamine banks, and liſtened to the melody of an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining aviary.</p>
                     <p>The allurements of the ſpot ſeemed to enchain the elder Henry, and he at length ſauntered to the ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>The ſignals of death, while they humble the rich, inſpire the poor with pride.—The paſſing-bell gave Henry a momentary ſenſe of equality,
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:030623_0201_0FE83E68014FC120"/>
and he courageouſly ſtept forward to the firſt winding of the avenue.</p>
                     <p>He darted back at the ſight which preſented itſelf!</p>

                     <p>A ſtandard-bearer now appeared with an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutcheon, on which the keys and mitre were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played. Young Henry, upon this, pathetically exclaimed,</p>
                     <p>"My uncle!—It is my uncle's funeral!"</p>
                     <p>Henry, his father, burſt into tears.</p>
                     <p>The proceſſion moved along.</p>
                     <p>The two Henry's, the only real mourners in the train, followed at a little diſtance—in rags, but in tears.</p>
                     <p>The elder Henry's heart was nearly burſting—he longed to claſp the dead corpſe of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without the dread of being ſpurned for his preſumption.—He now could no longer remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber him either as the dean, or biſhop; but leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over that whole interval of pride and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance,
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:030623_0202_0FE83E55A3CB9EB8"/>
called only to his memory William, ſuch as he knew him when they lived at home toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, together walked to London, and there, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, almoſt periſhed for want.</p>
                     <p>They arrived at the church—and while the cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin was placing in the dreary vault, Henry crept ſlowly after to the hideous ſpot—His reflections now took a different point. "Is this poſſible?" he ſaid to himſelf, "Is this the dean whom I ever feared? Is this the biſhop of whom, within the preſent hour, I ſtood in awe? Is this Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam, whoſe every glance ſtruck me with his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority? Alas! my brother, and is this horrid abode the return for all your aſpiring efforts? Is this the only remains of your greatneſs, which you exhibit to me on my return? Did you fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee an end like this, while you treated me, and many more of your youthful companions, with haughtineſs and contempt? While you thought it becoming of your dignity to ſhun and deſpiſe us? Where is the difference now between my departed wife and you? or, if there be a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſhe, perchance has the advantage.—Ah! my poor brother, for diſtinction in the other world, I truſt, ſome of your anxious labours have been employed; for you are now of leſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance in this, than when you and I firſt left our native town, and hoped for nothing greater, than to be ſuffered to exiſt."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="96" facs="unknown:030623_0203_0FE83E5FB3C7C878"/>
On their quitting the church, they enquired of the by-ſtanders, particulars of the biſhop's death, and heard he had been ſuddenly carried off by a raging fever.</p>
                     <p>Young Henry enquired "If Lady Clementina was at the palace, or Mr. Norwynne?"</p>
                     <p>"The latter is there"—he was anſwered by a poor woman, "but Lady Clementina has been dead theſe four years."</p>
                     <p>"Dead! dead!" cried young Henry, "That worldly woman, quitted this world forever!"</p>
                     <p>"Yes," anſwered the ſtranger, "ſhe caught cold by wearing a new-faſhioned dreſs that did not half cover her, waſted all away, and died the miſerableſt object you ever heard of."</p>
                     <p>The perſon who gave this melancholy intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence concluded it with a hearty laugh; which would have ſurpriſed the two hearers, if they had not before obſerved—that amongſt all the village crowd that attended to ſee this ſolemn ſhow, not one afflicted countenance appeared, not one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected look, not one watery eye. The paſtor was ſcarcely known to his flock—it was in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don his meridian lay—at the levee of miniſters—at the table of peers—at the drawing-rooms of the great—and now his neglected pariſhioners, paid his indifference in kind.</p>
                     <p>The ceremony over, and the mourning ſuite departed, the ſpectators diſperſed with ſmiling

faces from the ſad ſpot; while the Henrys, with heavy hearts, retraced their ſteps back towards the palace.—In their way, at the croſſing of a ſtilt, they met a poor labourer returning from his day's work; who looking earneſtly at the throng of perſons who were leaving the church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, ſaid to the elder Henry,</p>
                     <p>"Pray, maſter, what are all them folk gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together about? What's the matter there?"</p>
                     <p>"There has been a funeral," replied Henry.</p>
                     <p>"Oh zooks, what! a burying!—ay, now I ſee it is—and I warrant, of our old biſhop—I heard he was main ill—It is he, they have been putting into the ground is not it?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes," ſaid Henry.</p>
                     <p>"Why then ſo much the better."</p>
                     <p>"The better!" cried Henry.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, maſter—though, I ſhould be loath to be, where he is now."</p>
                     <p>Henry ſtarted—"He was your paſtor, man."</p>
                     <p>"Ha ha ha—I ſhould be ſorry that my maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's ſheep that are feeding yonder, ſhould have no better paſtor—the fox would ſoon get them all.</p>
                     <p>"You ſurely did not know him!"</p>
                     <p>"Not much, I can't ſay I did—for he was above ſpeaking to poor folks—unleſs they did any miſchief, and then he was ſure to take notice of them."</p>

"I believe he meant well," ſaid Henry.</p>
                     <p>"As to what he meant, God only knows—but I know what he <hi>did.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>"And what did he?"</p>
                     <p>"Nothing at all for the poor."</p>
                     <p>"If any of them applied to him, no doubt—"</p>
                     <p>"Oh! they knew better than all that comes to—for if they aſked for any thing, he was ſure to have them ſent to bridewell, or the workhouſe.—He uſed to ſay—"<hi>The workhouſe was a fine place for a poor man—the food good enough, and enough of it—</hi>" yet he kept a dainty table him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.

                     <p>"Did he give nothing in charity?"</p>
                     <p>"Next to nothing. A little weak broth, that runs through one's ſtomach like mad—a working man, maſter, can't live on ſuch meſs—and my wife wore out more ſhoe leather going after it, and loſt more time waiting at the door before his

                     <p>AS Henry and his ſon, after parting from the poor labourer, approached the late biſhop's pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, all the charms of its magnificence, its ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, which, but a few hours before, had capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated the elder Henry's mind, was vaniſhed—and, from the mournful ceremony he had ſince been witneſs of, he now viewed this noble edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but as a heap of rubbiſh piled together to faſcinate weak underſtandings; and to make even the wiſe and religious man, at times, forget why he was ſent into this world.</p>
                     <p>Inſtead of preſenting themſelves to their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew and couſin, they both felt an unconquera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reluctance to enter under the ſuperb, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy roof—a bank, a hedge, a tree, a hill, ſeemed at this juncture a pleaſanter ſhelter: and
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:030623_0208_0FE83E70AEA901E0"/>
each felt himſelf happy in being a harmleſs wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer on the face of the earth, rather than living in ſplendor, while the wants, the revilings of the hungry and the naked, were crying to heaven for vengeance.</p>
                     <p>They gave a heart-felt ſigh to the vanity of the rich and powerful; and purſued a path where they hoped to meet with virtue and happineſs.</p>
                     <p>They arrived at Anfield.</p>
                     <p>Poſſeſſed by apprehenſions, which his uncle's funeral had ſerved to encreaſe, young Henry, as he entered the well-known village, feared every ſound he heard would convey intelligence of Rebecca's death. He ſaw the parſonage houſe at a diſtance, but dreaded to approach it, leſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca ſhould no longer be an inhabitant.—His father indulged him in the wiſh to take a ſhort ſurvey of the village, and rather learn by indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect means, by obſervation, his fate, than hear it all at once from the lips of ſome blunt relater.</p>
                     <p>Anfield had undergone great changes ſince Henry left it.—He found ſome cottages raiſed where formerly there were none; and ſome were no more, where he had frequently called, and held ſhort converſations, with the poor who dwelt in them. Amongſt the latter number was the houſe of Hannah's parents—fallen to the ground! He wondered to himſelf where the poor family had taken up their abode? Henry, in a kinder world!</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="102" facs="unknown:030623_0209_0FE83EA2EFD24F40"/>
He once again caſt a look at the parſonage houſe—his inquiſitive eye informed him, there, no alteration had taken place externally—but he feared what change might be within.</p>
                     <p>At length he obtained the courage to enter the church yard in his way to it.—As he ſlowly and tremblingly moved along, he ſtopped to read here and there a grave-ſtone; as mild, inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, conveyers of intelligence, to which he could attend with more reſignation, than to any other reporter.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond ſtone he came to, he found was erected <hi>To the memory of the Reverend Thomas Rymer.</hi> Rebecca's father. He inſtantly called to mind all that poor curate's quick ſenſibility of wrong, towards <hi>himſelf;</hi> his unbridled rage in conſequence; aud ſmiled to think—how trivial now appeared all, for which he gave way to ſuch exceſs of paſſion.</p>
                     <p>But, ſhocked at the death of one ſo near to her he loved, he now feared to read on; and acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally caſt his eyes from the tombs to the church. Through the window of the chancel, his ſight was ſtruck with a tall monument of large di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions raiſed ſince his departure, and adorned with the fineſt ſculpture. His curioſity was excited—he drew near, and he could diſtinguiſh (followed by elegant poetic praiſe) "<hi>To the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of John Lord Viſcount Bendham.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="103" facs="unknown:030623_0210_0FE83E85CACEE438"/>
Notwithſtanding the ſolemn, melancholy, anxious bent of Henry's mind, he could not read theſe words, and behold this coſtly fabric, without indulging a momentary fit of indignant laughter.</p>
                     <p>"Are ſculpture and poetry thus debaſed," he cried, "to perpetuate the memory of a man, whoſe beſt advantage is to be forgotten? Whoſe no one action merits record, but as an example to be ſhunned."</p>
                     <p>An elderly woman, leaning on her ſtick, now paſſed along the lane by the ſide of the church.—The younger Henry accoſted her, and ventured to enquire, "Where the daughters of Mr. Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, ſince his death, were gone to live?"</p>
                     <p>"We live," ſhe returned, "in that ſmall cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage acroſs the clover field."</p>
                     <p>Henry looked again, and thought he had miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken the word <hi>we</hi>—for he felt aſſured, that he had no knowledge of the perſon to whom he ſpoke.</p>
                     <p>But ſhe knew him, and, after a pauſe, cried—"Ah! Mr. Henry, you are welcome back. I am heartily glad to ſee you—and my poor ſiſter Rebecca will go out of her wits with joy."</p>
                     <p>"Is Rebecca living, and will be glad to ſee me?" he eagerly aſked, while tears of rapture trickled down his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "Father," he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his ecſtacy, "we are now come home to be completely happy—and I feel as if all the years

I have been away, were but a ſhort week; and as if all the dangers I have paſſed, had been light as a feather.—But is it poſſible," he cried, to his kind informer, "that you are one of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca's ſiſters?"</p>
                     <p>Well might he aſk; for inſtead of the bloom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing woman of ſeven-and-twenty he had left her, her colour was gone, her teeth impaired, her voice broken. She was near fifty.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, I am one of Mr. Rymer's daughters," ſhe replied.</p>
                     <p>"But which?" ſaid Henry.</p>
                     <p>"The eldeſt, and once called the prettieſt," ſhe returned: "Though now people tell me I am altered—yet I cannot ſay I ſee it myſelf."</p>
                     <p>"And are you all living?" Henry enquired.</p>
                     <p>"All but one: ſhe married and died. The other three, on my father's death, agreed to live together, and knit or ſpin for our ſupport. So we took that ſmall cottage, and furniſhed it with ſome of the parſonage furniture as you ſhall ſee—and kindly welcome I am ſure you will be to all it affords, though that is but little."</p>
                     <p>As ſhe was ſaying this, ſhe led him through the clover field towards the cottage.—His heart rebounded with joy that Rebecca was there—yet, as he walked, he ſhu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">

make. He feared, what he imagined (till he had ſeen this change in her ſiſter) he ſhould never heed. He feared Rebecca would look no longer young. He was not yet ſufficient maſter over all his ſenſual propenſities, as, when the trial came, to think he could behold her look like her ſiſter, and not give ſome evidence of his diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.</p>
                     <p>His fears were vain.—On entering the gate of their little garden, Rebecca ruſhed from the houſe to meet them, juſt the ſame Rebecca as ever.</p>
                     <p>It was her mind, which, beaming on her face, and actuating her every motion, had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>He was entranced with joy.</p>

                     <p>THE fare which the Henrys partook at the cottage of the female Rymers, was ſuch as the ſiſter had deſcribed, mean, and even ſcanty; but this did not in the leaſt diminiſh the happineſs they received in meeting, for the firſt time ſince their arrival in England, human beings who were glad to ſee them.</p>
                     <p>At a ſtinted repaſt of milk and vegetables, a

glimmering light by a little bruſh wood on the hearth, they yet could feel themſelves compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively bleſt, while they liſtened to the recital of afflictions, which had befallen perſons around that very neighbourhood, for whom every delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous viand had been procured to gratify the taſte, every art deviſed to delight all the other ſenſes.</p>
                     <p>It was by the ſide of this glimmering fire, that Rebecca and her ſiſters told the ſtory of poor Hannah's fate; and of the thorn it had for ever planted in William's boſom—of his reported ſleepleſs, perturbed nights; and his gloomy, or ſtarting, and half-diſtracted days: when, in the fullneſs of remorſe, he has complained—"Of a guilty conſcience! Of the wearineſs attached to continued proſperity! The miſery of wanting an object of affection!"</p>
                     <p>They told of Lord Bendham's death from the effects of intemperance; from a maſs of blood in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by high ſeaſoned diſhes, mixed with copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous draughts of wine—repletion of food and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, not leſs fatal to the exiſtence of the rich, than the want of common ſuſtenance to the lives of the poor.</p>
                     <p>They told of Lady Bendham's ruin ſince her Lord's death, by gaming—They told, "that now ſhe ſuffered beyond the pain of common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digence, by the cutting triumph of thoſe, whom ſhe had formerly deſpiſed."</p>

They related (what has been told before) the divorce of William; and the marriage of his wife with a libertine—The deceaſe of Lady Clementina; occaſioned by that incorrigible va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which even old age could not ſubdue.</p>
                     <p>After numerous other examples had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited of the dangers, the evils that riches draw upon their owner; the elder Henry roſe from his chair, and embracing Rebecca and his ſon, ſaid,</p>

It was after a ſupper of roots from their little garden, poultry that Rebecca's hand had reared, and a jug brewed by young Henry, that the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing diſcourſe took place:</p>
                     <p>"My ſon," ſaid the elder Henry, "where un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſky, ſhall three perhaps be met together, happy as we three are? It is the want of induſtry, or the want of reflection, which makes the poor diſſatisfied.

Add to this, the rich fear dying, ſo much, they have no comfort in living."</p>
                     <p>"There the poor have another advantage," ſaid Rebecca, "for they may defy not only death, but every loſs by ſea or land, for they have nothing to loſe."</p>
                     <p>"Beſides," added the elder Henry, "there is a certain joy, of the moſt gratifying kind that the human mind is capable of taſting, peculiar to

the poor; and of which the rich can but ſeldom experience the delight."</p>
                     <p>"What can that be?" cried Rebecca.</p>
                     <p>"A kind word, a benevolent ſmile, one token of eſteem from the perſon, whom we conſider as our ſuperior."</p>
                     <p>To which Rebecca replied, "And the rarity of obtaining ſuch a token, is what encreaſes the honour."</p>
                     <p>"Certainly:" returned young Henry, "and yet thoſe in poverty, ungrateful as they are, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur againſt that government from which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the bleſſing; and unlearned as they are, would attempt to alter it. We leave to the phyſician the care of reſtoring our health, we employ the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier in fighting our battles, and the lawyer in the defence of our fortunes, without preſuming to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt them in their vocations—then, why not leave, and without moleſtation, thoſe to govern a kingdom, who have ſtudied the ſcience of politics? For though a phyſician may not always be ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, a ſoldier may not always have courage, a lawyer not always honeſty, or a miniſter always good fortune—yet, we ſhould conſider, that it is not upon earth we are to look for a ſtate of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection—it is only in heaven—and there, we may reſt aſſured, that no practitioner in the profeſſions I have named, will ever be admitted to diſturb our eternal felicity.</p>
