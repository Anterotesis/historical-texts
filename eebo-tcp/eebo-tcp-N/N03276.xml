            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and of the <hi>Souls</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> prevailed with me to write the following <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> to pay the Debt I have long owed to my fellow Creatures; in intreating them to enter into their own Hearts, and learn <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> of <hi>God himſelf,</hi> who ſpeaks <hi>there</hi> by <hi>His Spirit</hi> as never <hi>Man</hi> ſpoke; who ſpeaks <hi>there</hi> to much better Purpoſe, with <hi>clearer Evidence</hi> and <hi>Demonſtration</hi> than <hi>Men</hi> can <hi>ſpeak; that their Faith might not ſtand in the Wiſdom of Men, but in the Power of God</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. ii. 5.</note>.</p>
            <p>Which is the <hi>only Remedy,</hi> as I apprehend, for <hi>reſtoring Piety</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> to its <hi>primative</hi> Purity and Beauty, in an Age wherein the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Pretenſion to Power, in <hi>ſome</hi> of the <hi>Clergy</hi> (perhaps not of the beſt Lives) have made a great many Men of <hi>excellent</hi> Capacities

               <hi>too looſe,</hi> and <hi>indifferent</hi> unto <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis ſad to think, that becauſe ſome <hi>high Pretenders</hi> to <hi>Religion,</hi> who are of bad Lives and Principles, would exerciſe <hi>Dominion</hi> over the <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Conſciences</hi> of others, and turn <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> into <hi>worldly</hi> Riches and Immunities, make <hi>Gain</hi> their <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> and the <hi>Luſt</hi> of <hi>Power</hi> their <hi>earneſt Purſuit</hi>; (I ſay 'tis ſad to think) that therefore Religion, the moſt <hi>noble</hi> and <hi>neceſſary</hi> Thing in the World, ſhould fall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the <hi>Regards</hi> of Men.</p>

            <p>For tho' none of the <hi>real</hi> Injunctions of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> are, or ever can be contrary to <hi>right Reaſon,</hi> yet the <hi>common Reaſon</hi> of Man ſtands in Need of <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Help</hi> from <hi>Heaven,</hi> for attaining the <hi>true</hi> Knowledge and Practice of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi>; as the great <hi>Lock</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth, in the Quotations I have made from him in my fifth Chapter.

or repugnant to <hi>Reaſon,</hi> that 'tis the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit</hi> which <hi>enlightens</hi> and <hi>influences</hi> the <hi>noble</hi> Faculty of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> to the higeſt Pitch of Knowledge and Certainty in heavenly Things, and gives it the greateſt Repoſe, Delight and Satisfaction: Nevertheleſs, Reaſon and the Spirit of God remain always, two ſeveral Powers and Principles in Man, of different and diſtinct Natures, the one <hi>Humane</hi> and the other <hi>Divine.</hi> And what <hi>Lock</hi> ſays of <hi>Revelation,</hi> as contained in the Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> that

            <p>For Men ſometimes finding clear Diſcoveries of God in their Minds, and of their Duty to him on the one Hand; and of the Darkneſs, Impurity and Unpreparedneſs of their own Hearts for his Service, on the other Hand; are apt to impute thoſe Diſcoveries to the Light and Activity of their own Reaſon; or not to acknowledge that they are beholden to the immediate Revelation of God's Spirit within them for ſuch Diſcoveries; when one would think nothing in it ſelf can be clearer, than that Darkneſs cannot give Light for the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:003985_0005_10036B52538EED70"/>
of it ſelf: <hi>For whatſoever doth make manifeſt is Light</hi> 
               <note n="§" place="bottom">Eph. v. 13.</note>.</p>
            <p>Reaſon corrupted and depraved by vicious Habits, cannot diſcover the Corruption and Depravity of it ſelf, without Light from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, gives it ſuch Sight; much leſs can it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch Help know God and divine Things.
<q>It was all purely the Work of Grace (ſays the great <hi>Lock</hi>) for they were all dead in Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, and Sins, and could do nothing, not make one Step or the leaſt Motion towards it— 'tis God here (ſays he) does all by Revelation, of what they could never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover by their own natural Faculties — and being thus quickened by the Spirit (ſays he) may as Men alive, work if they will. <bibl>

            </p>
            <p>To deny Men the Influences of the divine Spirit, is to leave them without God in the World. To ſay the Light of humane Reaſon without Light from any Thing above it, is the Light of God's Spirit, or the only Light that is in Man, is to take one of the moſt effectual Courſes that can be, to overturn the Chriſtian Religion, which is founded on divine Revelation, and can only be ſavingly underſtood
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:003985_0006_10036B553B6CB138"/>
and practiſed by the Influence of the ſame Spirit which gave it Being. It caſts a very ill Aſpect on Devotion, and directly and unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly tends to render all Addreſſes to God, for Light and Help from him ridiculous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant: For if we our ſelves without any immediate Influence and Aid from him, are able by the Exerciſe of our own natural Powers and Faculties, to know and practiſe our whole Duty, to what Purpoſe do we ask Light and Aid from him?</p>
            <p>This Scheme tends to take off all Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon God, and the Light and Tuition of his holy Spirit, for Underſtanding and Strength; and to bring Men to depend on themſelves and their own Sufficiency; the fatal Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which too much appears in the World already, in the looſe and vicious Lives of Men; and is too likely to appear in a greater Degree, unleſs Men can be perſwaded to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the evil Ways of their own Hearts, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs themſelves to God, and depend upon, and become Subject to the Light and Power of his good Spirit in their own Souls.</p>
            <p>It was therefore my principal Deſign in the following Undertaking, to ſet before the Eyes of Men, and make it as plain to them as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly I could, that the Light of their Spirit
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:003985_0007_10036B582BA46CA0"/>
and of God's Spirit are of different and diſtinct Natures and Kinds. That their own natural Powers and Faculties alone are not adequate for attaining to the Knowledge and Practice of true Piety and Religion; and that therefore they muſt apply themſelves to God for Light and Help from Heaven, who is ready to <hi>ſhine into their Hearts</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Cor. iv, 6.</note>, and to <hi>work in them, to will and to do of his own good Pleaſure</hi> 
               <note n="§" place="bottom">Phil. ii. 12.13.</note>, if they will but withdraw their Hearts from this World and turn them to him, that he may purge them from evil, and diſpoſe them to Virtue and the Love of Himſelf; and prepare them for ſuch divine Senſations of his Goodneſs, as will fill them with inconceiveable Delights, <hi>with Joys unſpeakable and full of Glory</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">1 Pet. i. 8.</note> In Compariſon of which all the Pleaſures of this World are Nullities and Vanity.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only add, that on the various Subjects treated of in the following Pages, I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured, according to the beſt Light I had, to ſpeak of them, as clearly and diſtinctly as I could (which is all that can be expected from me) that the Reader might form, with as much Eaſe as poſſible, right Idea's thereof; and from thence take Occaſion, if he ſhall be piouſly and religiouſly inclined, to make Tryal of the

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of the Reaſon and Deſign of Piety and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</head>
               <p>THERE is nothing more becoming ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Creatures, than an early and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Conſideration of the Cauſe and Deſign of their Being; how they came to have Exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in this World, and for what End.</p>
               <p>It is prepoſterous to think that our Exiſtence was the Effect of meer Chance and Accident. The wonderful Order and Contrivance of the Parts, of which Man and the whole World of Beings are conſtituted; and the Support and Subſiſtence of ſuch an innumerable Company of Beings, in ſuch Beauty and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, as is evidently maintained in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe; prove nothing leſs, than, that the ſame
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:003985_0011_10036B60F8FFFAE0"/>
is the Effect and Deſign, of incomprehenſible Wiſdom. So that it ſeems impoſſible for any Man who gives himſelf the Liberty of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to doubt the Exiſtence of a Being who made, and ſuſtains, ſuch an infinite Number of Creatures: Which Being we juſtly call Almighty God. So that hence the Cauſe of our Being is clearly manifeſt.</p>
               <p>The next thing to be conſidered, is, what we may reaſonably conclude, this infinitely wiſe, and Almighty Being, deſigned in the Production of Mankind.</p>
               <p>Can it reaſonably be thought, that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended any thing leſs than their Felicity ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ſeveral Capacities, as well as his own Glory? That Man whom he hath made the nobleſt of all his Creatures, here on Earth, endowed with reaſon and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, was not in an eſpecial Manner, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to be a Partaker of the Fruition, and Felicity of his Maker?</p>
               <p>That, <hi>Man,</hi> as to his Body, is provided for in a Degree above the Beaſts of the Field, the Fowls of the Air, the Fiſhes of the Sea, and all other animate Beings, who have the Life of Senſation, whom they all fear in Virtue of the natural Dominion God hath given him over them, will, I doubt not, be readily agreed; and that he conſiſts of Body and Soul, an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and an inward Man, endowed with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003985_0012_10036B66360091D8"/>
Senſes adapted to the Knowledge of Things external and viſible; and a Mind, Soul, or intellectual Spirit, with inward Senſes, ſuited and adapted to the Preception and Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of internal and ſpiritual Objects, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: For the Accommodation and Felicity whereof, 'tis moſt reaſonable to believe, that God in his infinite Goodneſs hath made plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Proviſion.</p>
               <p>For can it be thought that the infinite and gracious God, ſhould make leſs Proviſion for our Souls, than for our Bodies; that he who hath ſo richly provided, for our outward Man, ſhould neglect the better and nobler Part of us, our Souls? that He who has provided a beautiful External World for the Pleaſure and Entertainment of the Senſes of our outward Man, ſhould not alſo have provided, a much more beautiful and glorious World, for the Pleaſure and Entertainment of the ſuperiour Senſes of our Inward Man?</p>
               <p>For as the Senſes of the inward Man, muſt needs be as much more excellent than thoſe of the outward Man, as the inward Man is more excellent than the outward; ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, muſt the Objects of Senſation of the former be much more excellent than the Objects of Senſation of the latter.</p>
               <p>Theſe Conſiderations afford a ſolid Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, for a noble Purſuit of true Religion,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003985_0013_10034F32B58074F8"/>
and the attaining the Knowledge, of the things of the heavenly Kingdom; for when Men are fully perſwaded, that they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Senſes ſuited and adapted to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and Enjoyment of him, they will not (if they conſult their own Intereſt) ſet their Hearts on the ſhort lived Pleaſures, and Enjoyments of this World, which we every Day ſee to be exceeding tranſitory and uncertain; but being as it were looſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, as to the Things of this Life, will ardently ſeek a divine Senſation, of the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and Enioyments of the ſpiritual Kingdom, called in the ſacred Writings, <hi>The Kingdom of God</hi>; which will afford them more ſatisfaction and delight, than, the Encreaſe of the Corn, Wine, and Oyle, of the Earth can do.</p>
               <p>We are to be here but a very little Time, and 'tis hard to think that, that noble and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Part of us our Souls or inward Man, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with ſuch wonderful and extenſive Capacities, which nothing leſs than the Knowledge and Enjoyment of God himſelf can truly and compleatly ſatisfy, will be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved with our Bodies; tho' were it to be ſo, which is entirely irrational to think, from the nature of Things; yet a Life in this World, in which, thoſe noble Powers and Faculties of the Soul, are enlightened and actuated by the Divine Spirit, and brought
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003985_0014_10034F6CDFC6DF58"/>
into a real Senſation, of the Things of the <hi>heavenly Kingdom,</hi> whereby our evil Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and Paſſions, which give us ſo much uneaſineſs, while they are predominant, would be brought under and mortified; and the Love of God and our Neighbour, a quiet and ſerene Mind and Conſcience, one of the greateſt Bleſſings on Earth, will naturally enſue; ſuch a Life cannot but be the moſt deſireable and delightful. And therefore it may very well be ſaid, that, <hi>Godlineſs has the Promiſe of the Life that now is,</hi> as well as, <hi>of that which is to come</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Tim. iv. 2.</note>.</p>
               <p>It hath been too much, more is the pity, the Deſign of a Generation of Men, who have called themſelves God's Prieſts or Miniſters, among Heathens, Mahometans, Jews, and Chriſtians, to render Religion very myſterious, and thereby themſelves more neceſſary, than there is juſt Occaſion for; which they have improved to the accumulating the Power, and Riches of this World to themſelves; to the great ſcandal and Damage of true Religion; and to the exceeding Diſcouragement of the Purſuit of divine Knowledge, and a true Senſe of God and Goodneſs, among Mankind. Erecting a Dominion over the Conſciences of the Laity, and dealing out to them ſuch

                  <hi>Creeds</hi> and <hi>Syſtems</hi> of Religion as they thought fit, in the ſeveral Parts of the World where they had Power, which the unthinking Part of Mankind have been obliged to receive, on peril of the Loſs of the Good Things of this Life, and as far as in them lay Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Life which is to come.</p>
               <p>Tho' at the ſame Time nothing can well be plainer, than, that the Knowledge of the Chriſtian Religion, is adapted to Men of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour, as well as ſuperiour Capacities, the Souls of the former, being as precious in the Eyes of God, and as capable of enjoying him, as the latter. And therefore it is, that as God affords Mankind, an <hi>external Luminary,</hi> the Sun in the Firmament for their Bodies, by which Medium Men may ſee the Things of this World, without the Help of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate; So he alſo in his great Mercy affords, an <hi>internal</hi> Luminary, <hi>The Sun of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> for their Minds; whereby Men may ſee the Things of God, and of the World to come, without the Help of Miniſters.</p>
               <p>It is true that the Miniſters of Religion, themſelves, being turned to God, have been, and ſtill are of great Uſe, in turning People to this <hi>Light of God</hi> in their Souls; adviſing them to open their inward Eyes to it, and to walk therein; that they may know and underſtand for themſelves; and feel in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

               <p>It was about 2400 Years after the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World, before Mankind had any external written Law, for the Rule and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of their Lives, ſo far as appears by either ſacred or prophane Hiſtory; in all which Time Mankind, generally ſpeaking, had only for their Rule of Faith and Manners the <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Creation</hi> as a Monitor to their outward Senſes, for Evidence of the Reality and Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty

<q>which it pleaſed God to bear our Fathers before the Law, ſo far prevailed with him, as that without any Books and Writings, by familiar and friendly converſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them and communicating himſelf unto them, he made them receive and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his Laws: Their inward Conceits and intellectuals being after a wonderful Manner, as it were, <hi>figur'd</hi> and <hi>charecter'd</hi> (as St. <hi>Baſil</hi> expreſſes it) by his Spirit, ſo that they could not but ſee, and conſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and confeſs the Truth of them. Which Way of Manifeſting his Will, unto many other gracious Priviledges which it had, above that which in after Ages came in Place of it, had this added, that it brought with it unto the Man, to whom it was made, a Preſervation againſt all Doubt and Heſitancy, and a full Aſſurance, both who the Author was, and how far his intent and Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reach'd.

               <p>IT will I doubt not be readily agreed, that the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God and the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Man, muſt needs be different and diſtinct in Nature and Eſſence. The <hi>divine</hi> Spirit and Wiſdom of God, and the <hi>humane</hi> Reaſon of Man muſt needs be of different Kinds and Natures; otherwiſe the Soul of Man would be God, of the ſame Eſſence with Him, and not a Creature, but Almighty, omnipreſent, and omniſcient; for ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Controverſy God is; elſe He could not produce ſuch an innumerable Company of Beings and Creatures, as are contained in the Univerſe, preſerve them in that admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Beauty and Harmony they are in, and provide for all Events, as 'tis manifeſt he
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:003985_0030_10034F42980E43A0"/>
doth, to the Wonder and Amazement of Men; which Man is utterly uncapable of. And therefore the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God, and the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> of Man, are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely different in their Powers and Natures. And then, that the Light and Operation of each of theſe Spirits or Powers, muſt needs alſo be of different Kinds and Natures, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Principles from which they flow, I think unavoidably follows. This I take to be exceeding clear from the Reaſon and Nature of Things, and the ſame is not leſs manifeſt from the Holy Scriptures.</p>
               <p>For God ſaid, <hi>My Spirit ſhall not always ſtrive with Man</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. vi. 3.</note>. If God's Spirit and Man's Spirit had been of the ſame Kind and Nature in their Light and Operation, there could not have been a ſtrife between them.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Levites</hi> acknowledging of God's Goodneſs to the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they ſaid unto him, <hi>Thou gaveſt alſo thy good Spirit to inſtruct them</hi> 
                  <note n="¶" place="bottom">Nehe. ix. 20.</note>. So that their <hi>Spirit</hi> had need of Inſtruction from God's <hi>Spirit,</hi> and therefore they appear to be two diſtinct Spirits in their Light and Operations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Spirit it ſelf beareth witneſs without Spirit, that we are the Children of God</hi> 
                  <note n="**" place="bottom">Rom. vlii. 16.</note>. The Apoſtle is here ſpeaking, of the Evidence and Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony

of the Spirit of God, to the Spirit of the Sons of God, that they are <hi>His</hi>; ſo that the Spirit of God, and the Spirit even of the Sons of God, the Spirit of Men born again, appear to be Diſtinct Beings and Spirits, and to be contradiſtinguiſhed in their Light and Operations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, neither have entered into the Heart of Man the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him: But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit</hi> 
                  <note n="§" place="bottom">1 Cor. ii. 9, 20.</note>. 'Tis evident, by the Inſufficiency of the Heart or Soul of Man to diſcover Gods Kindneſs, and Will to them who love him, without the Help or Revelation of God's Spirit, that they are diſtinct Spirits and have different Light and Operation.</p>
               <p>And in the very next Verſe we have the Apoſtles Reaſon, <hi>For what Man knoweth the Things of a Man, ſave the Spirit of Man, which is in him; even ſo the Things of God knoweth no Man, but the Spirit of God.</hi> A clearer Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between God's Spirit and Man's Spirit, in their ſeveral Lights and Operations cannot poſſibly be made. Here is ſee forth the abſolute Neceſſity of the Divine Illumination of God's Spirit, to enligthen Man's Spirit in order to his Knowledge of the Things of God.

               <q>The <hi>Excellency</hi> of this Life appears from the <hi>noble Principle</hi> that influences it; for <hi>a Life</hi> that owes all its <hi>vital Motions</hi> and <hi>Operations</hi> to a <hi>Principle</hi> that is <hi>heavenly,</hi> and <hi>ſublime,</hi> cannot but be excellent, and will diſcover that it is ſo, by its <hi>Inclinations</hi> and Deſires, by its <hi>Deſigns</hi> and Aims, by all its <hi>Actions,</hi> and Carriages, and by the <hi>ſecret</hi> Breathings and Tendencies of the inward Man, which certainly muſt be quite other than thoſe which <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> and <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,</hi> do inſpire withal; for ſince they proceed from a <hi>noble Principle,</hi> they muſt conſequently be of a higher and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Strain.

                  <note n="§" place="bottom">Joh. iv. 14.</note>. The Reſult of all theſe different Ways of ſpeaking amounts in ſhort to this great and Important Truth; namely, that a certain <hi>intimate</hi> and <hi>operative Preſence of God in the Soul,</hi> is that <hi>noble Principle</hi> of the new Life, which we are enquiring after. 'Tis this <hi>Preſence</hi> that by it's mighty <hi>Energy,</hi> and <hi>divine</hi> Force, communicates a <hi>heavenly</hi> Vigour and Sprightlineſs unto the inward Man. 'Tis <hi>it</hi> that powerfully <hi>touches</hi> and <hi>moves</hi> our nobler Faculties, that not only <hi>dilates,</hi> and <hi>actuates</hi> our Capacities, but alſo <hi>delightfully</hi> entertains and ſatisfies them; for it is the <hi>Light</hi> of the Underſtanding, and the <hi>ſovereign Good</hi> of the Will; it is the <hi>Love</hi> that raviſhes, and the <hi>Fulneſs</hi> that allayes the eager Thirſt of the Soul. We ought always when we have Occaſion to conſider or diſcourſe of this Subject, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to remember, that the <hi>Soul</hi> of Man was originally deſigned <hi>to lodge the Deity,</hi> and that for that End it was endued with <hi>Capacities</hi> vaſtly great and large, and ſuch as no created Object, nor even all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures together, do bear any Proportion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, it being only an <hi>infinite Object,</hi> that can
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:003985_0066_10036C0035F6E930"/>
give <hi>entire</hi> Repoſe and Quiet to thoſe <hi>bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> Deſires which we are conſcious, do move and ſtir in our Boſoms. Now the bleſſed <hi>God,</hi> that <hi>infinitely perfect</hi> and moſt <hi>communicative</hi> Being, is this Object; and he is ſo, not meerly after an <hi>Ideal Manner,</hi> as when we employ our <hi>active Powers</hi> in the Contemplation of him and his Excellencies, in which Caſe 'tis not himſelf, but ſome ſhadowey and languid Pictures of him, ſome <hi>faint Reſemblance</hi> of his Perfections, that are <hi>immediately</hi> preſented to our Minds. But he is then the <hi>beautifying Object,</hi> when he is <hi>really</hi> and <hi>efficatiouſly</hi> preſent in the Soul; and manifeſts his being there by his <hi>divine Operations,</hi> and the <hi>gracious Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications</hi> which he makes of his Light, and Grace, and ineffable Joys. This <hi>blisful Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,</hi> the Regenerate who are delivered from the <hi>Dominion,</hi> and cleanſed from the <hi>Impurities</hi> of Sin, have recovered again, and it is on the Account of it, that they are ſaid to be <hi>an Habitation of God through the Spirit, and the Temples of the Holy Ghoſt</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Eph. ii. 22. 1 Cor. vi. 19.</note> for that <hi>good Spirit</hi> takes <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> of them, reſides in their <hi>Hearts,</hi> becomes the <hi>Mover, Enlightner,</hi> and <hi>Director</hi> of all their Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Powers, gives a <hi>new</hi> and <hi>heavenly</hi>

Tincture and Tendency to all their Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and Deſires, and in one Word, is the <hi>great Spring</hi> of all that they think, or do, or ſay; and hence it is that they are ſaid to <hi>walk</hi> no more <hi>after the Fleſh but after the Spirit,</hi> and to <hi>be led by the Spirit of God</hi> 
                  <note n="¶" place="bottom">Rom. viii. 1, 14.</note>.

               <p>TO believe that God hath given us a Law to keep, which is either in its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or through Means of our Corruption, impoſſible by ſupernatural Aid to be kept; is to believe very prepoſterouſly of God, and to caſt a very high and diſhonourable Reflection on his Juſtice and Goodneſs.</p>
               <p>To think that he hath given an impoſſible Law to Mankind, is to think he hath given them no Law at all, becauſe ſuch a Law can be no Law to rational Creatures. An impoſſible Law is a Soleciſm, a Law that is impoſſible to be kept, is no Law in it ſelf, but muſt be void from the Beginning; as being intirely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Reaſon and Nature of Things.</p>
               <p>To think that the Grace which is come unto us by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is not ſufficient to purifie, and rectifie our Natures, and enable us to keep his Laws, ſince 'twas for our <hi>Breach</hi> thereof
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:003985_0125_10036CC2ECF4D5B8"/>
that he dyed, and made Atonement on the only and abſolute Condition of our Repentance and Leading a new Life; is to think very unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly of his great Undertaking, for us, and to render him no Saviour at all. For if he be not a Saviour from Sin, which is, and ever was the Cauſe of God's Wrath towards Men; his Diſpleaſure with them muſt needs remain; ſince he is of more pure Eyes than to behold Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. The Holineſs of his Nature will not admit any unholy Creature to abide with him; And therefore as <hi>Adam</hi> when he broke the Law of God, and defiled his Heart, was driven from his holy Preſence; ſo the Heart muſt be clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and we muſt return to Obedience to God's Law, before we can approach him, and enjoy his Delightful Preſence again.</p>
               <p>For this End therefore, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all Iniquity, not from the Guilt of it only, but from the Act, from the Thing it ſelf, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify to himſelf a peculiar People, zealous of good Works <note n="*" place="bottom">Tit. ii. 14.</note>. He came to finiſh the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, to make an End of Sins, and to make Reconciliation for Iniquity, and to bring in everlaſting Righteouſneſs <note n="†" place="bottom">Dan. ix. 24.</note>.

<pb n="117" facs="unknown:003985_0126_10036CC47415ADE0"/>
ſenſible of this important Truth; for, ſays he, <hi>He that committeth Sin is of the Devil for the Devil ſinneth from the Beginning. For this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe</hi> (therefore adds he) <hi>the Son of God was made manifeſt that he might deſtroy the Works of the Devil</hi>

               <p>'Tis the firſt and capital Article in the Creed of the Kingdom of Darkneſs to believe the Power of Satan in us to be ſtronger in it ſelf than the Power of Chriſt in us; a more direct Doctrine to perpetual Bondage unto Sin and Satan in this Life, cannot be invented; nor more oppoſite to the Kingdom of God and its coming in the Hearts of Men. This is believing the Devil is almighty in us inſtead of God, and that <hi>Christ</hi> in us is not able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne him, and caſt him out of the Hearts of Men.

they can have in this Life, but ſhall infallibly be conquered; is as great a Diſcouragement to Chriſtians in the Purſuit of Virtue, as it would be to military Men, to treat them after ſuch a Manner, in their Calling; contrary to the Wiſdom and Prudence of all Commanders.</p>
               <p>Tis rendring Prayer to God for Help and Strength againſt inward Corruptions and vitious Habits, vain and to no Purpoſe; and in a Word ſtrikes at the very Vitals and Eſſence of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; at the Kingdom and Dominion of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Hearts of Men: And is indeed a Doctrine contrary to Godlineſs and all Goodneſs, which one would think could never have entered into the Hearts of any Men, but ſuch as would make a Penny of the Peoples Sins, and are themſelves immerged in Impurity and Darkneſs; ſuch as are Strangers to the Life of God in their Souls; ſuch as are Ignorant of the Power of divine Grace, and unſenſible of the efficacious Operation of the divine Spirit in their own Hearts; through Neglect of Attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to it, and Dependance upon it; and in a Word ſuch as have their Heads filled with meer empty Notions of God, without their Hearts being turned to him.</p>
               <p>For nothing can be more evident and plain, to a Soul entred into the paths of Virtue, than that God who hath begun this good Work in them, is able to carry it on effectually, and
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:003985_0128_10036CCF11BF9FF8"/>

               <p>So that all the Failures, Miſcarriages and Evils which Men fall into, who in the Main may ſeek after Virtue and eternal Life, muſt be aſcribed to their Want of Watchfulneſs; to their Want of dwelling with God; to their Want of Due Subjection to the divine Spirit in their own Hearts; and not to a Neceſſity they are under of <hi>ſinning</hi>; not to Want of Power in the divine Grace, to ſave them from it; but for Want of their ſteddy and conſtant Adherence, to that heavenly Help; For want of Application to God, to be ſtrengthned with Might by his Spirit in the inner Man <note n="¶" place="bottom">Rom. viii. 2.</note>.
