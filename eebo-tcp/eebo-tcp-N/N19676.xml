            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IN a country where muſic has not yet become a regular profeſſion, it cannot be expected that a compoſition of this kind can ſtand a rigid criticiſm; but as every attempt to ſubſerve the intereſt, or to encreaſe the innocent pleaſures of the community, deſerves public patronage, the author of the following work, without further apology, preſents it to the public eye.</p>
            <p>He has aimed at originality in his compoſitions, and endeavoured to deviate (as far as he deemed it juſtifiable) from the common ſtyle; where he has given into it, he has attempted to improve it by a particular attention to the harmony.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who have encouraged the work by ſubſcription, are reſpectfully thanked, and are aſſured that the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt pains have been taken to render the work correct; ſuch errors as eſcaped obſervation in the execution of it, are noticed in the errata.</p>
            <p>The author ſincerely wiſhes that the purchaſers of the work may derive ſufficient advantage from it, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate them for their expenſes; but ſhould the reverſe be true, he will as ſincerely lament that he and his friends have miſtaken his abilities.</p>

               <p>All muſick is comprehended in <hi>melody</hi> and <hi>harmony.</hi> Melody is a ſingle ſucceſſion of founds; or, in other words, is the air of a piece of muſic. Harmony is the combination of ſeveral ſounds at the ſame time. Modula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the juſt arrangement of the ſounds both of the Melody and Harmony.</p>
               <p>The primary and moſt eſſential qualities of muſical ſounds are, <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Tune;</hi> upon a due attention to theſe diſtinctions, and their judicious management, depends all the pleaſing and infinite variety of the muſical art.</p>

               <head>Of the GAMUT, or SCALE of MUSIC.</head>
               <p>There are but ſeven diſtinct degrees of ſound in the ſcale; five of which are called whole, and two are called half, or ſemi-tones. Every eighth from any given ſound will be the ſame, and the degrees of aſcent or deſcent from it, will be in effect a repetition of the former ſounds. Theſe ſeven ſounds are repreſented on lines and ſpaces by the ſeven firſt letters of the alphabet; their places on them are as follow:

THE ſcale is divided into three parts; each part, conſiſting of five lines, with their ſpaces, and diſtinguiſhed with a cliff, is called a ſtave.</p>
               <p>The firſt diviſion is called the Baſs ſtave; its cliff is thus marked 𝄢 and is called the F cliff—it is always placed on the fourth line from the bottom.</p>
               <p>The ſecond diviſion of the ſcale is called the Counter ſtave;—its cliff is thus marked 𝄡 and is called the C cliff. It is commonly placed on the middle line of the ſtave. This cliff, however, is moveable, and may be placed on either of the five lines or ſpaces; that line or ſpace which paſſes between the two tranſverſe ſtrokes, will be C, and all the other letters of the ſcale will be in regular ſucceſſion above and below it.</p>
               <p>The third and laſt diviſion of the ſcale is called the Treble or Tenor ſtave; its cliff is marked thus 𝄞 and is called the G cliff; its place is invariably on the ſecond line from the bottom.</p>
               <p>There are but four names of notes repreſenting ſounds, viz. Mi, Fa, Sol, La: of which <hi>Mi</hi> is the principal, and governs all the reſt; and when <hi>Mi</hi> is found, the order of the notes above it will be Fa, Sol, La, Fa, Sol, La; and below Mi, La, Sol, Fa, and then <hi>Mi</hi> recurs, either way.</p>
               <p>It has been before obſerved, that of the ſeven degrees of ſound in the ſcale, two are ſemi-tones; their natural places are between B and C, and E and F. Their ſituation, however, is often varied by flats and ſharps, which tranſpoſe Mi from B, its natural place; in all which caſes the ſemitones will be between Mi and Fa, and La and Fa, as in the natural ſcale.</p>

               <p>Treble time is divided into three modes. The firſt mode is marked thus 3/2 and contains three minims in a bar, or other notes and reſts to that amount. The bar is performed in the time of three ſconds.</p>
               <p>The ſecond mode of treble time is marked thus 3/4 and contains three crotchets or their value in each bar, and is performed about a quarter faſter.</p>
               <p>The third mode of treble time is thus marked 3/8 and contains the value of three quavers in a bar: This mode is performed about a quarter faſter than the ſecond.</p>
               <p>There are many modes of compound time, two of which only ſhall be noticed here.</p>

It may not be unſerviceable to obſerve in this place, that the firſt mode of common time is the ſtandard with which all other modes are compared, and by which they are regulated. All modes which are marked with figures have a primary reference to this mode, and are derived from it;—thus, the mark 2/4 denotes that the bar muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain two fourths of a bar in the firſt mode of common time, or (which is the ſame thing) of a ſemibreve; and all other figures diſtinguiſhing different modes may be conſidered as fractions of a ſemibreve; the under figure ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing how many parts the ſemibreve muſt be divided into, and the upper figure ſhewing how many of thoſe parts are contained in a bar.</p>
               <p>When the modes above explained are thoroughly underſtood, a proper attention to the foregoing remarks will enable any one to acquire an idea of all other modes marked with figures, without any further illuſtration.</p>

               <p>Accented parts of the bar are, for common time, the firſt and third parts; for treble time, the firſt part only; for compound time, the firſt and fourth parts of the bar; and emphatical words ſhould be ſet to thoſe parts; but it will often happen, that ſuch words will occur in other parts, and the accented parts have words of no emphaſis; in which caſes, every one muſt feel the propriety of the muſic's bending to the words, and that the general rule for accenting muſt be neglected; and from hence, may be inferred, that the doctrine of accent is deſigned more for the uſe of the compoſer, than of the performer.</p>

               <p>THERE are but two keys in muſic, viz. 1ſt, the major or ſharp key, and 2d. the minor or flat key. The firſt of theſe is adapted to expreſs the cheerful paſſions, and the latter is expreſſive of the ſolemn, the mournful and the pathetic.</p>
               <p>The key note is that ſound upon which a tune may be ſaid to be built:—It is the predominant tone, to which all others have a particular reference; it is commonly the concluding note of the tenor, and always that of the baſs,

               <p>In the natural ſcale the key note of the major key, will be C; of the minor it will be A.</p>

The regular places for the half tones are between B and C, and E and F, an examination of the octave as laid down above, ſhews that they lie between the third and fourth, and between the ſeventh and eighth, conſequently it is in the ſharp key, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>No tune can be regularly compoſed on any other letter beſides C and A, without the aſſiſtance of flats or ſharps; but, by a proper placing of them on the lines and ſpaces, every ſemitone contained in the octave may be made the foundation or key note of a tune: For in ſtance, if the letter C be taken for the key note of a tune in the major key, one of the ſemitones will be between the ſixth and ſeventh, whereas it ſhould be between the ſeventh and eighth; now, by placing a ſharp on F, the ſound of all the notes on that letter will be a ſemitone higher than in the natural ſcale, and conſequently leave but half a tone between the ſeventh and eighth from G; by which mean, G then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes regularly the key note for a tune in the ſharp key.</p>
               <p>It would be no difficult taſk to extend this explanation through all the ſemitones contained in the octave, but perhaps it may be ſufficient for learners to be taught to diſtinguiſh the keys, in the firſt place, by the following rule, viz. if the key note be the <hi>Fa</hi> immediately above Mi, a third from it will be a major third, and the muſic will be in the ſharp key; but if the key note be the <hi>La</hi> immediately under Mi, a third from it will be a minor third, and the tune will be in the fiat key.</p>

               <p>EVERY perſon ſhould ſing that part to which his voice is beſt adapted; to determine which, learners ſhould ſubmit to the judgment of their teacher.</p>
               <p>The tone of the baſs ſhould be full and majeſtic; of the tenor, bold and manly; of the counter, ſoft yet firm; of the treble, ſmooth and delicate.</p>
               <p>High notes in every part ſhould, in general, be ſung ſofter than the low.</p>
               <p>In a company of fingers it would have a good effect for ſome of the performers on each part to be ſilent when paſſages marked <hi>piano,</hi> occur; the additional ſtrength of their voices in the <hi>forte,</hi> which generally precedes or ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the <hi>piano,</hi> would mark the contraſt more diſtinctly, and give peculiar force and energy to the performance.</p>
               <p>The various inflections of voice and tone, which render one <hi>air</hi> more expreſſive of one paſſion than another, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be taught by certain and infallible rules; a performer ſhould endeavour to form a proper idea of the author's deſign in a piece of muſic, and his own judgment and taſte muſt be his principal directors in doing juſtice to it.</p>
               <p>A good and graceful manner of ſinging is beſt acquired by <hi>imitoetion.</hi> A teacher cannot by precept alone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct his pupils in the art of modulating different airs to expreſs different paſſions; but by example he can.</p>
               <p>Every note of every part of an excellent piece of muſic may be founded, ſtrictly ſpeaking, right, and the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, nevertheleſs, appear dull and trifling. It is the expreſſive manner—the realizing the paſſion—and giving particular emphaſis to thoſe words which contain the force of the ſentiment, which give riſe to the inexpreſſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light derived from hearing good muſical performances.</p>
               <p>The voice, the looks, the geſtures of the performers, are ſeverally neceſſary to give muſic its full energy, and are reſpectively the ſources of pleaſure or diſguſt to the obſerving hearer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="xvi" facs="unknown:025695_0016_0FCEC07D08973418"/>
Beſides the artificial graces of muſic, ſuch as trills, appoggiatura, &amp;c. there are innumerable others which never have been, nor ever can be, defined; but muſt be learned (as was hinted before) by imitation, or ſuggeſted by a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning judgment.</p>
               <p>Few graces, however, if any, are admiſſible in full choruſſes, unleſs they are expreſſed in the compoſition; in ſtrains of two or three parts, they may be frequently introduced; but ſolos are the proper field for their full diſplay.</p>
               <p>A vulgar, inarticulate pronunciation—a heavy, lifeleſs manner—ſudden and unmeaning exploſions of ſound, are totally inconſiſtent with good ſinging; on the other hand, a clear and ſpirited tone—a juſt and accurate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation—and occaſional ſwells upon the notes, judiciouſly introduced, are diſtinguiſhing characteriſtics of an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant performer.</p>
               <p>In good muſic, as well as in good poetry, or in any other ſpecies of good writing, there are different ſtyles; ſome of which, though they may not, at firſt hearing, command a very favourable opinion, upon being often performed, and rendered familiar, will pleaſe more, and longer, than others which were thought ſuperior; hence, the impropriety and injuſtice of haſtily rejecting, as worthleſs and inſignificant, ſuch muſic as may be compoſed out of the common ſtyle.</p>
               <p>In compoſition, it is an eſſential point to adapt the tune to the ſubject of the ſong. Subjects of penitence, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſorrow, &amp;c. require tunes in the minor key; and thoſe of cheerfulneſs, joy, thankſgiving; &amp;c. the major key; but this rule is often violated; and with the moſt unhappy and ridiculous effect. Can that joy, or praiſe, or thankſgiving be thought ſincere, the expreſſion of which is accompanied with ſighs, and groans, and tears? Can <hi>his</hi> ſorrow or diſtreſs appear otherwiſe than farcical, whoſe relation of it is interrupted by ſallies of pleaſantry, and peals of laughter? If this be not an unjuſt repreſentation of the effect of diſregarding the foregoing rule, (and it is preſumed it is not) it muſt be conſidered not only a tranſgreſſion againſt all muſical propriety, but an outrageous affront to common ſenſe.</p>
               <p>In churches and congregations this rule demands a ſtill more particular attention; for an injudicious application of tunes to the pſalms or hymns, will make the performance appear a profane burleſque upon a very important duty.</p>
               <p>A decent and regular demeanor in a band of ſingers, adds much to the pleaſure ariſing from their performances; in worſhipping ſocieties, a contrary behaviour is altogether inexcuſable, and well deſerves the cenſure of every ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber mind; for it argues a total inſenſibility to thoſe ſolemn impreſſions, which every one ſhould feel when in the more immediate preſence of the <hi>Supreme Being,</hi> and employed in one of the higheſt acts of his worſhip.</p>
