            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Accustomed to reflect on the nature and extent of our foreign relations, and to watch their tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and vibrations, he has manifested considerable confidence on Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental subjects; and he has not, to his knowledge, made a material asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion respecting them without a substantial document in his possession to warrant it. Should the Author be so fortunate as to induce any deluded citizen to relinquish his political errors and herecies, an important object will be gained.</p>

            <p>IT has hitherto been usual for orators, on occasions similar to the present, to furnish labored dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertations on the nature of civil Government, and on the origin of our political existence—to entertain their hearers with animated description of the progress of freedom, and with diversified pictures of public peace and prosperity. But at a period, when <hi>Europe</hi> is afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with terrible commotions, and exhibits a disgustful scene of Gothic barbarity and blood—When <hi>America,</hi> and the world, seem devoted to the same contagious <hi>stamina</hi> of revolution, a serious aspect is imposed on this anniversary, and demands rather the exercise of deliber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate judgment, than the spontaneous effusions of joy and gratulation. Permit me then to touch lightly on the painful history of our country—more fully to investi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the causes of national disorders, and the remedies necessary to mitigate their asperity—to unfold and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrate the interest and policy of the <hi>American</hi> people, and the destructive tendency of modern revolutionary sentiments. The method here, prescribed is consistent with the portentous crisis of the times, and compatible with the practice of the sires of antiquity, in the sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary of the GODS.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:036370_0005_1009215687A50418"/>IT is a fixed principle in the economy of nature, that nations, like families, must divide, and occupy se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate portions of the globe. Excessive population, and a dissimilarity of political and religious sentiments, not unfrequently contribute to this end. Add to this— mankind possess an invincible propensity to emigration; they figure to themselves riches and pleasures in the desert waste, and pastoral and romantic scenes, not to be found in populous cities, nor in cultivated countries. Were it not for this propensity, nature would be frus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated in the dispersion of her children—in the birth and progress of culture, and in the diffusion of the arts and sciences.</p>
            <p>THIS remark is forcibly exemplified, in the discov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, settlement, and progressive improvement of <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.</hi> History furnishes us with no character similar to that of our own. Most nations owe their origin to the conquests, or to the accidental settlements of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians; the early events of whom are either unknown, or inveloped in fable. The first emigrants to this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try were advanced in civilization, and were acquainted with the arts and conveniences of life: They possessed a wakeful jealousy of arbitrary rule; always ready to defend their rights—cool, dispassionate, and brave. This character they inherited as a legacy from the early in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Britain;</hi> whose sagacity and exertion ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled them to set bounds to the dangerous prerogatives of the crown, and to live in a state of freedom. What but this awakened such a formidable opposition to the legions of imperial <hi>Rome?</hi> What but this established the great charter of privileges in 1245—a transcript of the rights enjoyed under the more ancient Saxon monarchs? What but this produced the religious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in 1559—the celebrated petition of right in 1628, and ultimately, the memorable revolution in 1688, at the accession of the House of Orange to the throne?</p>
            <p>BUT <hi>England,</hi> like all other countries, exhibits in her history, many periods of weakness, and of cruelty—
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:036370_0006_1009215A08F4ADC8"/>
especially when she sharpened the dagger, and lighted the torch, of fanaticism; and when, with the rod of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, she wasted the human race. In some portions of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, she was transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a slaughter-house of heretics, and trembled with the agonies of malefactors at the stake. We are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to look with horror on these brutal excesses of arbitrary power, and to stand astonished at the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and depravity of man. Some doubt the benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and even the existence of Deity; and they derive it from, and fortify it by, the prevalence of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical and moral evil—from the apparent disorders of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and from the conflicts of nations: But these pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful vicissitudes are not without a salutary use in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Government of the universe. Men of this temper heed not the <hi>causes,</hi> nor trace the <hi>effects,</hi> of such awful, tho' wise and necessary, dispensations of Providence. The meditated destruction of ROMULUS in his cradle, founded the <hi>Roman</hi> republic. To the conquest and pillage of <hi>Europe</hi> by the invincible CAESAR, we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted for civilization, and for a knowledge of the arts and sciences. The <hi>American</hi> empire owes its origin to the sanguinary tribunals of <hi>Britain,</hi> and its subsequent independence to the oppressive and arbitrary measures of her councils.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>GREAT-BRITAIN</hi> has generally been celebrated for her political wisdom, and as the careful nurse of manly sentiment and virtue—yet we often find her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the dominion of a crooked and disjointed policy, and disposed to establish the reign of despotism. Early in the present century, measures were concerted to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us of our rights. These rights were secured to us by various charters. These charters were consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>England</hi> as errors in her policy; and she resolved to impair them by a gradual, and almost imperceptible assumption of authority over us. Hence our commerce in many instances was restricted, and in others totally prohibited: Hence exorbitant excise and impost duties were levied and collected with a greedy hand: Hence
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:036370_0007_1009215B8B61E508"/>
to cut down the pitch and tar trees of our forests—to manufacture steel, or to slit iron in our forges, exposed us to heavy penalties: Hence the common law of the land, and the trial by jury, were abolished, and our ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens obliged to answer to charges of a criminal nature, before a foreign tribunal: And then, as a prelude to hostilities on the one part, or to unconditional submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion on the other, we were insulted with this pointed declaration,
<q>that Great-Britain had a right to bind us in all cases whatsoever.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS tone of unwarranted authority, joined to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated acts of aggression, awakened the pride and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of <hi>America.</hi> Memorable is that day in our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, when <hi>Lexington</hi> and <hi>Concord</hi> became the tombs of <hi>English</hi> glory; and terrible to <hi>Britain</hi> was that day, when the heights of <hi>Charlestown</hi> were immersed in the blood of her veteran sons. To detail the events of the Revolution, would only be a trite display of historical erudition. We might excite a mixture of pity and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment at the wanton cruelties and depredations of an enemy—and a deluge of tears at the recollection of departed heroes. But the events of the present day, of which we shall treat in the sequel, demand the suffrage of all these passions. Permit me only to say, that time has, in a great measure, closed the wounds, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired the ravages of war—that our citizens, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired in the bed of honor, are set like stars of the first magnitude—and that to their memory a monument is erected, as durable as the pillars of time.</p>
            <p>NO sooner had <hi>Great-Britain</hi> yielded to the claims of <hi>America,</hi> than difficulties of a political nature suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to those of war. The singular genius of the <hi>American</hi> people required a form of Government, dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar to any in existence. We had found that systems, drawn from abstract theory, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> us in their appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to practice. The Confederation of the States was a transcript of the Amphyctionic and Achean leagues of <hi>Greece;</hi> and, like them, it contained the seeds
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:036370_0008_1009215E110B28C0"/>
of its own dissolution. The want of adequate powers in the federal head, and the imbecility of our fiscal ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangements, were among its most prominent defects. These primary errors in our policy, tho' extremely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larming in their nature, tended to stimulate our patrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism. They convinced us, that it is as difficult to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the operation of any political abstract theory, spun from the brain of a speculative philosopher, as it is to discover the qualities of a book by the title-page, or the propensities of the heart by the features of the face; and that nations, if they mean to be happy, must be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated with systems of Government, adapted to their particular wants. Systems of Government are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible, like those of morals, to any fixed standard of right—they grow out of the errors of society—and their energies must operate in proportion to the ignorance or knowledge—the ferocity or humanity of mankind. Speculative writers, therefore, on the subject of Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, seldom derive their principles from actual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment: They forsake the path marked out by the hand of nature—and place men in a situation, in which they ought to exist, rather than contemplate them in the sphere in which they actually move. Our present fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral Government was founded in a conviction of these truths. It has avoided all abstract theory; and as it was the result of combined wisdom, drawn from the sober lessons of experience, it may justly be stiled a new ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment in legislation. Under it, our wounded credit has been restored—our revenue augmented beyond any former example;—dignity and energy are attached to our public councils, and the utmost security and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom are afforded to the citizens.</p>
            <p>BUT such is the economy of the wisest institutions, that very few have been able to promise themselves any considerable duration. Some have been destroyed by a contest for power—some by the prevalence of ignorance and superstition, and others <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> by the rage of occasional disorders in the human mind— which are not less fatal to nations than the plague to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals.
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:036370_0009_1009216091987C70"/>
The world is at this moment afflicted with an inveterate and singular disease—malignant in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture—contagious in its operation, and which constitutes a new article in the vocabulary of national calamities. Effectually to resist its progress, desperate remedies must be applied—otherwise all legitimate Government will receive an incurable wound, and every moral and religious sentiment be banished from the human mind. We pretend not accurately to investigate its origin— but I beg leave to draw your attention to some of the most rational conjectures on the subject.</p>
            <p>AT the close of the last, and at the beginning of the present, century, a new description of speculative philosophers, made a conspicuous figure in the elder world. By them all Religion and Government were deemed the mere instruments of tyrants—designed to perpetuate their power, and to keep the people in the chains of vassalage. By their inflammatory writings, always plausible, and conceived with the nicest art, they enlisted the prejudices and passions of mankind, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited a spirit of uneasiness and revolt. Their great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject was, with the scythe of desolation, to equalize the world, and gradually to establish the primeval state of man. To effect this delusive scheme, they aimed to des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troy the belief of a GOD—to corrupt the public mind by their herecies—and to bring the Ministers of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the chief magistrates of nations, into contempt. Not content with the diffusion of these principles thro' the medium of labored volumes, periodical essays, and pamphlets, they found means to exhibit them at theatres, and other public places, in all the charms of eloquent diction. These may be considered, perhaps, as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote causes of the present disorders—but the origin of a regular digested system of revolution, grounded on the passions and vices of men, is of a more modern date.</p>
            <p>SUCH was the number of disorganizers and atheists in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> about the middle of the present century, that they formed themselves into private asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations,

and cemented their union by the most solemn oaths. These societies had in them many men of liter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary talents—a horde of pamphleteers and punsters, and most of the influential editors of newspapers—all of whom were extremely dissolute in their characters—de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void of any fixed and permanent principles on the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Government and Religion, and on whose consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences atheistic and sanguinary notions, made no terrible impression. To augment the number of their apostles and followers, and at the same time to deceive the world as to the nature and extent of their principles, they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed the character of Masons.<note n="*" place="bottom">The existence of the societies of <hi>Illuminati</hi> has given rise to much spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation Authors, although they agree as to the origin and nature of them, have not been sufficiently explicit on one point;—A cursory perusal incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates a belief (especially among the less informed part of the community, and among men of suspicious tempers and strong prejudices) that the masonic in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution is pregnant with Atheistic and revolutionary sentiments. The Rev. Dr. MORSE, a pillar of adamant in the temple of Federalism, has imbibed this mistaken notion. The practice of Masons, and the principles they inculcate, will best explain their detestation of Atheism and revolution: These modern doctrines are directly opposed to their principles;—and they will not fail to resist their progress.</note> They resorted not to rebellion and arms, the usual weapons of political chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, but confided wholly in the physical force of public opinion; and to collect this physical force to a point, and to direct it to an object, they eventually usurped the empire of learning—became the proprietors of literary journals, and other important sources of information— foisted themselves into the government of Colleges and Academies—obtained an invincible controul over the courts of justice—and, by a secret impulse, moulded all the measures of legislation. This secret and powerful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, enabled them to corrupt the integrity and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals of <hi>Europe</hi> by the propagation of their political dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas and atheistical creeds; and, in case of detection, to avoid the punishment due to their crimes.</p>
            <p>THESE surreptitious societies were awakened to the dictates of antecedent philosophers and atheists. They aimed, by a cautious and powerful process, to revive the pastoral and golden ages of antiquity;—for they
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:036370_0011_1009216983996EB8"/>
held that no true happiness was to be acquired in civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized community—nor unless free from the restraints of Government, and the fetters of religion. No wonder that such sentiments should flatter the prejudices of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind—excite the whirlwinds of sedition, and draw vast multitudes into their fatal vortex. Every day witnessed their deleterious effects, but nobody could penetrate their cause. The contagion was universal—it spread like the plague of old—it operated on the mind like a subtle poison on the body, and no remedy appeared to baffle the malady.</p>
            <p>SUCH was the increase of this contagion, and such the number and influence of its devotees, that they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventually unmasked themselves more fully to the world. At the commencement of the French Revolution, near 600 of these nocturnal clubs existed in the bosoms of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany.</hi> As this event was generated by the silent operation of their principles on the public mind, its progress was hastened and embittered by every possible exertion. The more effectually to form, and to extend a destructive system of revolutionary war, and thereby to reduce their preposterous theory to practice, a deputation from most of them met in dark conclave at <hi>Paris,</hi> and organized themselves into a grand convention of the lodges—over which the DUKE OF ORLEANS pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sided, and in which the celebrated MIRABEAU, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent TALLEYRAND, sustained the two next offices of rank. In this convention, the exact counterpart of the Alem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bic of hell, dissertations on philosophy, and the modern rights of man, composed their eloquent debates: Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Utopian felicity, the abolition of all society and Government, and the utter extinction of every species of religion, were openly discussed and concerted: The ambassadors of heaven were driven from their alters, and either banished or destroyed—monarchs precipitated from their thrones, and either massacred or bound in fetters of iron. Add to this—the Jacobin society in <hi>Paris,</hi> so famous in the history of the <hi>French</hi> Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was wholly composed of the members of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; and hence the origin of that detestable cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:036370_0012_1009216C01EC5710"/>
so odious in all countries, and which is now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered as a reproach to human nature.</p>
            <p>TO impute the disorders in <hi>Europe</hi> to the influence of these secret societies, is a sentiment of recent date; and therefore the more liable to objection. But the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition of their records, and other documents—the testimony of repentant brethren, and the apparent hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age paid them by the National Convention of <hi>France,</hi> establish the fact beyond the reach of doubt. Some of the early decrees of this convention against religious institutions, were palpable plagiaries from the homilies of these secret societies. They all, in the very same language, denounced the holy bible as a system of rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles and superstition: In the very same language, they all abolished the worship of GOD—the rites of the sanctuary—and the observation of the Sabbath; and, in the very same language, they all recommended Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism as the established creed of mankind. This affinity discovers itself in a vast variety of other interior opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. We see it even in the geometrical divisions of <hi>France</hi> into departments and cantons, and in the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the new calendar, by which a strange meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphosis has happened in the several portions of the year—for they bear an exact resemblance to the mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical grades established among the associated clubs;— they make a part of the same system of innovation, and were necessary to its completion. This affinity also forms a conspicuous feature in the exterior policy of <hi>France.</hi> The maxim of these societies—"<hi>that the</hi> END <hi>to be obtained sanctifies the</hi> MEANS <hi>necessary to it,</hi>" has been faithfully copied by the <hi>Terrible Republic</hi> in every stage of her eccentric progress. "<hi>To divide and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer</hi>" is the motto inscribed on every page of her modern history. Her arms excite no unusual dread among na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Before she aims the blow, she creates internal disorder—divides the people from their Government; and then her purposes are easily effected by the bayon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets of legionary cut-throats. Who will not weep at the fate of <hi>Holland, Geneva, Switzerland,</hi> and a great por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

of <hi>Italy?</hi> They mistook the poison for the honey— became the dupes of a perfidious policy—and then expir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in agonies at the feet of a directorial army. Prior to the disruption of <hi>French</hi> fraternity among them, they were free and happy—now they are slaves and miserable. These once happy countries, not more fertile in animal and vegitable productions, than in the works of taste and genius, are now filled with blood and tears—their cities and temples are dismantled—their monuments of art and labor are levelled with the dust—their most precious memorials of antiquity are transported to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> and there deposited to amuse the curiosity of regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides, and mock-patriots—their religion and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have fallen miserable victims to atheism and bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age;—and these deluded republics are now doomed to disclose a frightful image of barbarism, murder and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation.</p>
            <p>SUCH are the effects of revolutionary senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And does the boasted republic of <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Equality</hi> exhibit a more pleasing picture? GOD in his wrath has exposed her to strong delusions—permitted her to be the scourge of nations, and the instrument of her own destruction. A mild and pacific monarch, the father of his people—the hoary systems of national and municipal laws, and the venerable institutions of religion and morality, have all been destroyed by the philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers of regenerated <hi>France.</hi> And what are the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes? A prostituted Directory, whose bloody robes of office are an exact index to the cruel and relentless purpose of their hearts;—a constitution, replete with absurdity, and founded on the modern rights of man— calculated to patronize ignorance and error at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of wisdom and truth—to banish able and upright men from the public councils, and to fill their places with the worthless demagogues of faction;—a legal sanction to atheism and vice, and to the prevalence of blasphemous principles. The temples of the most high, and the various walks of science, once filled with devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and with the pupils of the arts, are now turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to military academies, and exhibit the awful apparatus

of death. Where once stood the stately harvest, the joy and comfort of the peasant, <hi>now waves a forest of bayonets.</hi> The face of the earth, instead of flowers and the blossoms of vegetation, is covered with the bones of immolated citizens; and instead of pity at the terrible effusion of human blood, each wanton butchery of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands produces a decree from the Directory, "<hi>that the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Republic have deserved well of their country!</hi>" We turn with disgust and horror from this picture of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man wretchedness, and solicit heaven in mercy to shield <hi>America</hi> from similar calamities.</p>
            <p>IN <hi>France,</hi> under the monarchy, as well as under the republic, an invariable disposition has existed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire an undue ascendancy over us; and this she seemed to consider as no more than an equivalent for our debt of national gratitude. Not till our Independence was fully guaranteed by the Convention of <hi>Saratoga,</hi> could she be prevailed on to assist us in our revolutionary war; and the assistance she finally afforded us was not intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to establish our Independence, but to humble the pride of <hi>England.</hi> When the British Councils signified their disposition for peace, and their readiness to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish all claim of supremacy over us, <hi>France</hi> endeavor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by her insidious policy, to prevent a suspension of hostilities, and the adjustment of national disputes. By her diplomatic skill, she even induced Congress to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct our Ministers not to conclude a peace without her consent, nor without an agreement on her part to the conditions of it. Her object was, if possible, to render this country dependent on its ally; or if this project failed, to acquire an exclusive right to our fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eries—to some of our frontier posts, and to a large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of our western territory. Unable to corrupt the integrity of our Ministers,<note n="*" place="bottom">The vigilance of Messrs. ADAMS and JAY is here only meant Dr. FRANKLIN gave his utmost support to the views of the <hi>French</hi> cabinet —and why? Let facts decide. When he entered into public life he possessed only a moderate share of property.

<pb n="16" facs="unknown:036370_0015_10092173D58B6D38"/>
elude their vigilance by a perfidious attempt secretly to pursuade <hi>England</hi> to claim the surrender of these privileges to herself—to insist on the return of the banished tories—on a restitution of their confiscated pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and the total relinquishment of the Missisippi to the King of Spain. In this subtle manouvre, her object was, either to get these important advantages into the hands of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> or divided between them; in which case she conceived herself able, by conquest or exchange, eventually to obtain the possession of them. But the die was already cast. The English cabinet, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gusted at the duplicity of a rival nation, instructed its Minister to conclude a secret or separate peace; and our national interests dictated to our Ministers the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of an immediate negociation, without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or concurrence of <hi>France.</hi> On this ground the treaty of 1783 was concluded; and its conclusion af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded a temporary suspension to the intrigues of the French councils.</p>
            <p>ANTERIOR to this event, in 1778, was adopted the treaty between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>America.</hi> As a reciprocity of benefits was the basis of the negociation, it was sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated at the desire of the French Minister, "<hi>that free ships should make free goods;</hi>" or, in other words, that the goods of an enemy on board of the vessel of a friend, should not be liable to seizure and condemnation. The operation of this principle was found convenient, and similar stipulations are inserted in many modern trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and, as between the contracting parties, the law of nations, relative to this point, is totally changed— for by this law the goods of an enemy, found in neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral bottoms, are deemed lawful prize. But such is the extensive commerce, and maritime greatness of <hi>England,</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:036370_0016_1009217558432E80"/>
that to govern herself by the more ancient rule, is strongly urged by her interest. Hence the principle "<hi>that free ships shall make free goods,</hi>" is excluded from her policy, and the goods of an enemy, found by her cruis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in neutral vessels, may be legally seized and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned: Yet notwithstanding this, <hi>France</hi> was bound to respect all treaty stipulations, and to permit our ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels to be the carriers of the goods of an enemy. This, however, was found to operate against the interest of the <hi>Terrible Republic,</hi> and she contrived pretexts to infract her engagements. The property of belligerents on board of our vessels was seized and condemned as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful prize. She resorted to our treaty with <hi>England</hi> in 1794, in justification of <hi>past</hi> excesses, as well as to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize all <hi>subsequent</hi> depredations;—by the rage of which our lawful commerce has been made the sport of licenced robbers—our industrious seamen imprisoned, and treated with indignity, and vast multitudes of them massacred in cool blood, by the modern canibals of <hi>France.</hi> Her decrees on this subject, form an eccentric and multifarious code; and, like those of the first legis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator of <hi>Athens,</hi> are written in blood. By one of them, all the provisions and military stores of our own, bound to the port of a belligerent, and every species of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty belonging to an enemy, and found on board of our vessels, were declared lawful prize. This is repugnant to the express stipulations of our treaty, and contrary to the law of nations—for by the one, the quality of the property is to be determined by the quality of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, and the other permits neutrals to furnish belliger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents with these articles of commerce—provided block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aded ports, and places previously declared in a state of siege, draw no immediate supplies from them.—By a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, the cruisers of the republic were authorized to observe towards neutrals the same treatment which they suffered <hi>England</hi> to inflict.—By a third, the mere SUS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PICION of her cruisers, that our vessels were laden with the property of an enemy, was declared good cause of capture and condemnation—unless the claimants were able to prove, that it did NOT belong to a belligerent.
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:036370_0017_100921791EB30DF8"/>
To prove an allegation <hi>true,</hi> and to adduce evidence of its <hi>falsity,</hi> are very opposite in their nature. Indeed, this decree exposed our merchants to this alternative, either to abandon their property to a gang of sea marauders, or to prove a <hi>negative</hi> before the sanguinary tribunals of the republic—a mode of process contrary to the max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims of every civilized nation—and an imposition not even practiced among savages.—By a fourth, the Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory has manifested to the world the <hi>neplus ultra</hi> of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man depravity: Our citizens taken on board of belli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent vessels, are deemed PIRATES; and are not even permitted to adduce either terror or violence as any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse for an involuntary act. This decree, more bloody than the rescript of a NERO, evinces the blackest turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Directorial policy, and that the <hi>Terrible Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic</hi> is now in the backward path to her ancient Gothic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism. By numerous other decrees, all predicated on the principle of plunder and rapine, every portion of our extensive commerce has been prostrated; and as long as the spoil is divided among the members of the Directory—the several courts and agents of the repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic—we can expect no mitigation of these outrageous excesses.</p>
            <p>ADD to this—the general policy of <hi>France</hi> is not confined to European nations, and to her own nautical banditti, but it also excites and supports a band of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret agents and <hi>precious</hi> friends in this country. What was the conduct of the infamous GENET, (and he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally pursued his instructions) but a tissue of misde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanor, corruption, and treason? Did he not engage our citizens to fight the nations with whom we were at peace? Did he not assume the right of opening our ports to the reception of prizes, and of fiting out pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateers among us, to cruize against our friends? Did he not claim the establishment of an independent and separate judiciary in the bosom of our country? When informed by the President, that these practices were not authorized by treaty—that they were repugnant to the law of nations, and infractions of our neutral duties—
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:036370_0018_1009217BA5F4EF28"/>
did he not with studied insolence appeal from the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of that venerable magistrate to the opinion of the people? Did he not establish secret and inflammable so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties among us—inflate them with the poison of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risian mob—excite the prejudices of the people against their own Government—and implant in the bosom of <hi>America,</hi> the revolutionary dagger of <hi>Europe?</hi> Were not the diplomatic intrigues of his successors in office, of a similar cast? Were not their labored manifestoes, filled with acumen and invective, better calculated for a misguided people than for the dispassionate Executive of the United States? Did they not infuse their politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <hi>mania</hi> into our public councils;—and may not the existence of party—the tide of opposition to executive measures—and that evident predilection for French fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, be traced to the same polluted source? In fine— have not the Agents of <hi>France,</hi> rich in the esteem of the Directory, and of our own defectious citizens, granted bribes to some, and to others favors and protections? If this proud republic means to be just—if universal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution be not her object—why trample on all the forms prescribed among nations, and reject our messengers of peace? Negociation was not consistent with the interest or character of <hi>France.</hi> She was well aware, that a scrutiny of her conduct would impair her credit, and unmask her to the world in all her ugliness and defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. It was therefore her policy to create suspence— and to protract the moment when a definitive answer of reception or rejection became necessary—thereby to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest the appearance of a pacific disposition, and to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble her cruisers to augment their stock of plunder. Probably the late farce about a new negociation, owes its origin on the part of <hi>France</hi> to the same principle, and will doubtless terminate in the same manner. If her public councils are free from ministerial cupidity, why demand almost three hundred thousand dollars for the private purses of the Directors? To pay one cent for the privilege of stating our complaints, is abject sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; and sooner than <hi>America</hi> should feel the chains of tributary vassalage, may her existence be blotted out from under the sun of Heaven!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:036370_0019_1009217F1E949148"/>THESE desultory remarks, my fellow-citizens, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit but a very imperfect picture of the conduct and views of <hi>France.</hi> The measures of that republic for most of the last eight years, have been so extraordinary in their nature, and so rapid in their succession, that they appear more like the shades of a magic lanthern, than the settled operations of any durable policy. Like the corruscations of the northern lights, they diverge into a profusion of lines, and emit no other rays than those of blood; and if the prospect of a peaceable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion now and then breaks thro' the gloom, it results either from the projected union of all mankind against them, or from the probability of their own eventual explosion.</p>
            <p>IT is a curious feature in the operation of our Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment that, while danger like a cloud thickens over us, measures of <hi>defence</hi> against <hi>France</hi> are urged and pursued by one party, and against <hi>England</hi> measures of <hi>offence</hi> are as strongly promoted by the other. This di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of sentiment and exertion, at this eventful crisis of liberty or bondage, must be imputed to the new po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical light of <hi>France:</hi> We not only feel its influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence—but it is her boast—an engine with which she is almost sure to effect her purposes. What but this gave birth to the propositions in our public councils for the suspension of all commerce with <hi>England,</hi> and to the subsequent resolutions for the sequestration of British property? What but this produced and invigorated the violent opposition to the treaty of 1794, with that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? This may be considered as the last <hi>important</hi> struggle of a deadly faction; and the extraordinary manner in which it was generated and conducted, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited a temporary delirium in the public mind. It, however, verified the truth of an old observation, that sudden and powerful impressions generally give a wrong bias to public opinion, and that mature reflection will alone enable the great body of the people to discover their real interests. This remark might be illustrated by many examples. The treaties of <hi>Utrecht</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:036370_0020_100921809FA0C958"/>
in 1712 and 1729, created a similar ferment in <hi>England.</hi> The doors of the parliament-house were bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricaded by the enraged multitude—the ministers who negociated them were pelted in the streets, and burnt in effigy by an irritated populace—yet their eventual oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation manifested their salutary tendency; and it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der these two very treaties, in concert with the navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation act, that the English commerce has increased to almost a monopoly.</p>
            <p>CONVINCED that perfidy and aggression accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated strength from patient forbearance, <hi>America</hi> banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at last the dreams of confidence, and resorted to a system of defence—the origin of which may be traced in the rejection of our ministers. To prevent the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of our unprotected seamen, and the wanton pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage of our property, and at the same time to force the republic to terms of accommodation, the treaty of 1778 was declared as no longer obligatory—all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial intercourse with the French dominions was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited—an infant navy was established to convoy our merchantmen, and to capture the armed cruisers of the republic—our ports and harbours were fortified, and garrisoned with troops for the common defence, and provision made for an eventual army, equal to the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of the times.</p>
            <p>INTERNAL security was also promoted by this sys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of defence. Our Government adopted measures to restrain the influence of defectious aliens, and to curb that <hi>mendax infamia</hi> from the press, which had corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed public opinion—excited an opposition to the laws, and stimulated rebellion. Perhaps a concise analysis of some of these governmental measures may be expected at this time, and be deemed compatible with the duties of the day.</p>
            <p>THE Alien and Sedition bills have been attacked as unconstitutional and oppressive: They have excited
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:036370_0021_100921832219E390"/>
the complaints of defectious foreigners and citizens, and the pointed disapprobation of the Legislatures of two States in the Union.</p>
            <p>THE Alien bill permits the President to order dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous aliens to depart the United States; and, in case of refusal, to cause them to be removed or imprisoned. This act is said to be unconstitutional, because it adopts a summary process, and deprives aliens of the right of trial by jury. These objections necessarily pre-suppose, that <hi>removal</hi> implies <hi>punishment,</hi> and consequently the actual commission of offences; and hence this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posterous conclusion is drawn, that punishments are au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized without the trial by jury. A very simple mode of argument will refute every possible objection to this act. In the first place, the constitution recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizes no principle as applicable to aliens. In the next place, aliens are not parties to this instrument, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot claim the benefits of it. They possess not the rights of citizens, and therefore a removal deprives them of none. The law very wisely supposes many of them to entertain sentiments of a hostile nature against the Government; and therefore to prevent the actual commission of offences, it authorizes their removal from the United States. Can this precautionary mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure be deemed rigorous or unconstitutional? Aliens are like travellers in a strange land; they are exposed to the same inconveniences, and are equally limited in their rights—mere tenants at sufferance under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. No traveller has a right to intrude himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a strange family; and if permitted by the laws of hospitality to refresh himself in it, he cannot claim a longer indulgence than the family is willing to give— particularly if he creates disorders, or manifests a dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to hostility, the family has a right to rid itself of a troublesome guest. The United States are only a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily on a more extensive scale; they have a similar right to see, that the laws of political hospitality are not infracted, and to expel suspicious and dangerous itiner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants from their jurisdiction. This is not a singular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:036370_0022_10092185B41E8780"/>
of authority—every Government inherently pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesses the right to exercise it—and all Governments have exercised it on the eve of a war, or when the safety of the public demanded it.</p>
            <p>EQUALLY weak, and capable of refutation, are the arguments against the Sedition Bill. To constitute an offence under that part of the act relative to libellous publications, several requisites are necessary. The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter published must be <hi>false, scandalous</hi> and <hi>malicious</hi>—di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly tend to <hi>defame</hi> the President, or one of the branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the federal Legislature—and to bring one or the other of them into <hi>contempt</hi> and <hi>disrepute.</hi> This clause is objected to, as repugnant to that article of the consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, which very wisely provides, "<hi>that no law shall be made abridging the liberty of speech or of the press.</hi>" This sound maxim constituted one article in the politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal creed of our ancestors—and it has been in practice ever since the year 1694. This practice, in a great measure regulated by various judicial decisions, and by the concurrent opinion of learned sages, has given to these words a technical operation—a precise and defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive meaning—which is, <hi>that no law shall be made to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit publications.</hi> Were such a law in existence, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of speech and of the press, would be abridged— but to punish the authors of false and malicious libels, which tend to destroy the characters of public men— to disunite the people, and to bring the Government in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to contempt, is to invigorate and to enlarge the boundary of its freedom. All crimes are founded in the abuse of the liberty of action; and is it unconstitutional to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain this abuse by the imposition of adequate penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? The same argument would come with equal force from the mouths of robbers and traitors—with equal propriety they might complain of the abridgment of their liberty by the infliction of criminal justice. Some pretend to argue that the Sedition Law, in the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of libellers, creates a new crime in society. The fact is, that this description of offenders were before punishable by the common law of the land—but as au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:036370_0023_1009218A44005290"/>
by the common law, were not permitted to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the truth of libellous publications as an excuse, the act in question allows it to be given in evidence; and this is one reason which induced Congress to pass it. The common law also confided the nature and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the punishment to the discretion of the Court— but the Sedition Law defines it; and this is another reason which prompted the federal Legislature to enact a statute on the subject. Besides—most of our state Constitutions contain clauses similar to the one in our federal charter, "<hi>that no law shall be made abridging the liberty of speech or of the press;</hi>" and yet all the state courts have recognized the doctrine of libels—and have, at their discretion, inflicted penalties on the authors of libellous publications. It is therefore a curious kind of argument, and pregnant with absurdity, to say, that the state courts have a right to admit this common law principle, and at the same time to deny its operation in the courts of the Union—for the federal and local con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions contain the same prohibitory clause, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in the very same words.</p>
            <p>THESE two Acts of Congress originated in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of the times, and were found highly expedient.</p>
            <p>MOST of our domestic troubles for several years past—our divisions both in and out of our public coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, are very justly ascribed to the restless temper of aliens; they have fomented and nourished discontents— impaired public confidence, and awakened treasonable practices. Many of them are fugitives of justice; and the more securely to propagate their revolutionary sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents—the very <hi>momentum</hi> of their nature—they have taken refuge in the United States. So true is the sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casm of a foreign satyrist, that in <hi>America, "every scoundrel convict is a King!"</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SEVERAL venal and prostituted presses have long labored among us with the most detestable views. To support the liberty of the press, must base calumny and
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:036370_0024_1009218CC1D18BB0"/>
lies be tolerated? Is this liberty infringed when the murderers of reputation, and the propogators of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion and treason, are exposed to the rod of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Our Government, like every other of a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative nature, derives its energy and support from public opinion; and when this fails, or becomes cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, it either degenerates to a phantom, or is total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly destroyed. Public opinion, in this country, is form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and regulated by the presses. These are the mirrors in which the people see and judge of the conduct of their rulers. If therefore these important mediums of communication prove deceptive, and are pregnant with inflammatory and revolutionary sentiments—if they sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice the most palpable truths to the most destructive falshoods, and thereby disseminate groundless jealousies, and weaken the hands of Government—is it not the duty of our political watchmen to punish aggressors in the abuse of constitutional liberty? A deluge of the blackest calumny has for years issued from some of our public papers, and eventually excited an irritation in the public mind. The impression at first was hardly perceptible—but the continual dropping of the water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spout will in time wear away the most durable substance. The President has been painted as a sullen tyrant—the majorities in Congress as the prostituted hirelings of the British cabinet, and the fraternizing brotherhood of French partizans among us as the great pillars of our insulted liberty, and as the saviours of our country. To these very partizans we may charge all our political troubles. Their actions authorize the high carnival of rebellion and of revolution, and serve to create a horde of domiciliary tyrants and cut-throats in <hi>America:</hi> For, while our constituted authorities have struggled to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a system of neutrality, they by a repellant power, have aimed to draw us into a contest with <hi>England,</hi> and to bring us under the yoke of Directorial despo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism. Our policy and interest dictate the necessity of peace—but these proud sons of sedition, subservient to the beck of the brutes and atheists of <hi>France,</hi> dissemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:036370_0025_1009218E4493FB58"/>
their licentious and poisonous dogmas—disaffect the public mind—paralyze the exertions of Government— and patronize on the American stage the bloody trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A DOCTRINE is prevalent, and dexterously propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated as the great palladium of our liberty, that the people ought to keep alive the fire of republican jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousy, and to watch with an eye of suspicion every measure of our Government. This is constitutionally right to a certain extent—but when they imagine, that our Government <hi>naturally</hi> inclines to corruption, and to a dangerous accumulation of power, they manifest inaccurate conceptions of its structure and principles. No political truth is more evident than that foreign Governments are pregnant with danger—while the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est danger to be apprehended in <hi>America,</hi> is from the wicked disposition, and blind credulity, of certain por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the people. These contrary and opposite sources of danger arise from the different natures of the several Governments. European institutions are not composed of a delegation of power;—the constituted authorities are not responsible to the people for an abuse of trust; they possess a distinct and separate interest from their constituents; and such is the opulence and power of privileged orders, that the community is in a manner controlled by them. This opulence and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and this control, in <hi>America,</hi> are wholly in the hands of the people. Our rulers, at very limited pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods, return to the walks of private life—submit their conduct to the scrutiny of their constituents, on the rectitude of which they rely for the continuance of public suffrage—and the burthens they impose on the community are equally felt by themselves. If these remarks be just, it necessarily results, that the grand pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of foreign Governments, is POWER, and that the only foundation of our own is PUBLIC CONFIDENCE. One other conclusion is equally obvious, that foreign Governments possess a <hi>dangerous power,</hi> and that a simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:036370_0026_1009218FC7820AF8"/>
power, in this country, <hi>is wholly vested in the people</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A well-constructed fortress is sometimes impregnable— but public opinion is as variable as the winds of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. These sentiments may possibly excite the surprize of some, and perhaps others may consider them as a species of political blasphemy—but the truth of them is verified by the history of other nations, and by the constant experience of our own.</p>
            <p>OF all the calamities to which nations are exposed, those of war are the most cruel and destructive.—Yet, like many other evils in society, they must rather be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated than expunged from the systems of human po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy. We need not here repeat the distinctions usually made by civilians between wars designated by the terms <hi>just</hi> and <hi>unjust</hi>—because they all agree, that if any may be termed <hi>just,</hi> they are those of a defensive nature— and because no other description of war will ever be consistent either with our interest or policy. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>America</hi> draws the sword, it will not be to plunder, nor to conquer, nor to enslave and to inflict misery on the human race—but to repel aggravated aggressions, and to snatch our Independence from the meretricious embraces of French fraternity, or to save it from the iron grasp of undisguised and open enemies.</p>
            <p>IF an invasion of our country take place, or if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion be excited by the arts and intrigues of foreign cabinets, or by their secret and authorized agents, we may anticipate a resistance adequate to the danger. The military spirit manifested in all parts of the Union, affords a happy presage of success. Every day brings tidings of additional corps, who have voluntarily ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered their services to our country; and the one in this town, and now before us, is not the least respectable, nor the last to manifest American patriotism. Let each individual member of it bear in mind, that in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the toils and dangers of the field, is the glory to be acquired; and that the reward of essential services,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:036370_0027_1009219533B307F8"/>
in times of public hazard, is a harvest of laurels. One prominent feature in the duty of soldiers, is to guard and to protect the standard, round which they rally. The loss of it often exhibits the want of courage; and to desert it, is absolute disgrace. Motives of a peculiar nature concur to stamp the one attached to the FEDER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AL VOLUNTEERS OF <hi>PORTLAND,</hi> with addition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al value.<note n="*" place="bottom">The PORTLAND FEDERAL VOLUNTEERS, is a company composed of the Youth of this town. Its Officers are commissioned, and its services accepted, by the President of the <hi>United States,</hi> in conformity to the Act of Congress, passed the 28th May, 1798.—On the 25th of June, 1799, the Young LADIES of the town presented the FEDERAL VOLUNTEERS with an elegant Standard.— This badge of female patriotism was accompanied with an Address at once laconic and impressive. The ceremony on the part of the LADIES was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted with the greatest propriety;—and the military evolutions of the day reflected the highest honor on the VOLUNTEERS.</note> It is the workmanship of female hands; and the donation originated in female patriotism. These circumstances will stimulate, fresh from the mint of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary honor, the brightest deeds of glory in its defence.</p>
            <p>WERE men restricted to the weapons furnished them by nature, the concomitants of war would be less dreadful. It is to the prostitution of their intelligent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and perhaps to their deadly hatred of each other, that we must impute those terrible instruments of death, to which they always resort in the settlement of national disputes, and frequently in the adjustment of private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries. They are the inventors of those dreadful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines—from whose brazen mouths issue frightful peals of thunder, and volumes of smoke and lightning— whose ponderous messengers, swift-winged in air, drench fields in blood—involve whole cities in flames and dust, and sink the proudest navies beneath the wave. The ingenuity of mankind has, therefore, reduced war to a science—in which personal prowess and bravery are poor substiutes for military equipment and discipline. Hence it is our duty to acquire the theory of modern war, and to be prepared to practice its lessons in the field.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:036370_0028_10092197B1383070"/>BUT here let me pause—While <hi>Europe,</hi> like some fiery volcano, trembles with frightful and protract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed eruptions, and the night-bird pays her devoirs over hecatombs of slain, Peace, with her numerous blessings, is still predominant in our country. The danger an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced from the bosom of that low-hung cloud on the margin of the east, decreases in proportion to the strength of our defensive measures; and we trust that, on the face of this great empire, perpetual tranquility is stamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the finger of heaven. Let us learn wisdom from the calamities of war, and read the projected fate of <hi>America</hi> in those prominent lessons, written in the blood of nations.</p>
            <p>PROMOTE the progress of education among the people, and encourage the arts and sciences. These are at once the ornaments and glory of a Republic. Hence will proceed wise legislators, and good laws, and an unity of sentiment in the public mind. Fortified with these ramparts, we may bid defiance to the thunders of the most potent attack, and extort a pre-eminent respect from the world.</p>
            <p>ALREADY our opulence and extent of country have attracted the notice of the most distant nations. "Where rolls the sea on which our sails have not been spread— and where is the clime not enriched by the productions of our soil?" The great fabric of our constitution and laws, founded in the patient deliberation of an enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened people, is considered by other nations as the most perfect model of political wisdom and precision. Its pillars, composed of the American virtues, will only moulder and fall in the prevalence of disunion and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. Then suffer not the canker-worm of jealousy to weaken them, nor let the proverb of old be verified, that the unusual prosperity of a nation announces the period of its fall. The means of safety and happiness are within ourselves. We have little to fear from the open violence of outward enemies: Their secret influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:036370_0029_100921994397EFE8"/>
effected by their gold and insidious arts, is most to be dreaded. Who is proof against the charms of opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and power? Probity and honor are sometimes pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loined by the hand of <hi>Midas,</hi> and virtue and integrity banished by corruption and pride: But, altho' a SUMNER, one of the brightest ornaments of human nature, has been recently snatched from our local councils, still we have an ADAMS to concert, and a WASHINGTON to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute, the measures of national defence; and therefore we need not fear the arts of flattery, nor be intimidated by the menaces of opposition.</p>
            <p>IF our conduct be actuated by sound policy, and if we cling to our constitution as the rock of our political salvation, we may safely calculate on the events of futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. The broad perspective of time is expanded to our view. The margins of our interior waters are crowded with cities, and the spir<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> of magnificent structures are buried in the clouds. The gloomy forests, once the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence of savage beasts, and unexplored by human steps, now exhibit peaceful mansions, and the plenteous fruits of culture. Our canvass whitens the <hi>Arctic</hi> seas, and swells to the breezes of the torrid zone. Smiling peace, and roseate health, establish their salutary reign; and the prospects of pleasure beyond the grave, miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the terrors of dissolution.</p>
