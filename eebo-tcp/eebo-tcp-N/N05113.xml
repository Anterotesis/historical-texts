            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </hi> Sin 2. The <hi>Cauſes</hi> hereof aſſigned both meritorious and inſtrumental, the <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Faith.</hi> 3. The <hi>Deſign</hi> of God herein declared, <hi>viz.</hi> The manifeſtation of his <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE firſt Benefit mentioned in our Text, is <hi>Propitiation</hi> or <hi>Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whom God hath ſet forth to be a Propitiation.</hi> It is <hi>Chriſt</hi> that the Apoſtle here Speaks of, as appears from the preceeding Verſe, him the Father hath purpos'd and engaged in his Councils and Covenant from Eternity to be a PROPITIATION, and hath actually exhibited him as ſuch in Time, not only by the Shadows of the Law and Propheſies of the Prophets, but alſo by the open preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel after his Advent. To be a Propitiation, <hi>ilaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion,</hi> either from <hi>ilaſcomai,</hi> to expiate Sin or ſhew Mercy; or from <hi>ilaſco placo,</hi> to aſſwage, quiet, pacify, atone, reconcile, There is in the Words a <hi>Metalepſis</hi> of the Effect for the Efficient; <hi>Chriſt</hi> is call'd a <hi>Propitiation</hi> becauſe he purchaſed it, inſtead of <hi>propitiator,</hi> reconciler, pacifyer, &amp;c. The Word <hi>ilaſterion,</hi> is the Title of the Mercy Seat; this is aſcrib'd to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becauſe in many Things he reſembles it; it was indeed an eminent Type of him: The Mercy Seat cover'd the Tables of the Law which were broke by us, to ſignify that by <hi>Chriſt</hi> pardon is procur'd for us;
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:006426_0003_1028E4816A1285E8"/>
by the ſprinkling of the Blood of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> upon it, God was rendered propitious or favourable, and exhibited himſelf there upon a Throne of Grace, ſo it is in <hi>Chriſt</hi> alone that God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to Sinners, and thro' him we have acceſs to the Father: He interpoſes between divine <hi>Juſtice</hi> and our <hi>Guilt,</hi> and purchaſes the Kindneſs of God for us. God was peculiarly preſent in a Cloud on the Mercy Seat, and gave gracious Anſwers thence to his People from between the Cherubims, (<hi>Levit.</hi> xvi. 2. <hi>Num.</hi> vii. 83.) Thus it is only in <hi>Chriſt</hi> that we can expect God's ſpecial Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and a merciful Anſwer to our Requeſts.</p>
            <p>The 2d <hi>Benefit</hi> mentioned in our Text, which is indeed but a conſequent of the former, is the <hi>Remiſſion</hi> of <hi>Sins,</hi> i. e. The cancelling of their Guilt, or our Obligation thro' them to Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now this is obtained by the <hi>Propitiation</hi> or Atonement of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> This Remiſſion the Apoſtle obſerves, extends to <hi>Sins that are paſt,</hi> i. e. Not only to Sins committed after <hi>Chriſt's</hi> coming, but to Sins committed before it, even from the Foundation of the World: He only mentions the Sins that are paſt, becauſe that ſeem'd incredible that the Effect of Remiſſion ſhould exiſt before its Cauſe, and likewiſe that he might repreſent the great Value and Efficacy of the <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> which not only extended forwards to the Time to come after it, which is eaſy to conceive, but alſo to the Time paſt before it. It was a difficult and momentuous Queſtion, What became of the Fathers who dyed before <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s coming? Now the Apoſtle tells us, that they were forgiven, and God's forbearance exerciſed towards them, <hi>the Times of Ignorance God winked at.</hi> We muſt conſider the Death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> not as a natural but a moral Cauſe; it's not ſtrictly or properly as a <hi>Medicine</hi> that heals, but as a <hi>Ranſom</hi> that frees a Captive. Natural Cauſes operate nothing before their actual Exiſtence, but Moral Cauſes do. Its ſufficient that they ſhall be, and that the Perſon with whom they are effectual, accept the Promiſe. A Captive is releaſed upon aſſurance given that he will ſend his Ranſom, tho' it is not actually paid: Thus the Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was available to purchaſe pardon for Believers before his coming; for he interpoſed as their <hi>Surety,</hi> and God, to whom all Things are preſent, knew and ſaw the accompliſhment of it in the Time promiſed; and hence he is called <hi>the Lamb ſlain from the Foundation of the World,</hi> not only in reſpect of God's Purpoſe concerning the certainty of his Death, but likewiſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Efficacy of it. The Salvation we derive from him was ever in him. It is true, under the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> they had not ſo clear Knowledge of him, yet notwithſtanding they enjoyed the Benefit of his Sufferings: For the <hi>Medium</hi> by which his Benefits are conveyed, is not an exact Knowledge of what he did and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, but ſincere Faith in the Promiſe of God. Now the divine Revelation being the Rule and Meaſure of our Faith, ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree was ſufficient to Salvation, as anſwered the general Diſcovery of Grace: Believers then depended upon God's Goodneſs to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:006426_0004_1028E484B6A87E20"/>
them in a way honourable to his Juſtice: By their Ceremonies and Sacrifices they were taught the reality and greatneſs of their Diſeaſe and Danger, and the neceſſity and ſufficiency of a Remedy without themſelves, even in the <hi>Meſiah:</hi> And from hence, together with the Propheſies of the Prophets reſpecting him, they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to believe that he would certainly come in due Time and bring Salvation with him: Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> rejoiced to ſee <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Day, and <hi>Moſes</hi> valued the Afflictions of <hi>Chriſt</hi> more than the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of <hi>Egypt.</hi> From what has been ſaid it appears, that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> is one eſſentially; they differ but as the Morning and Evening Star, which is the ſame, but is diverſly called from its Appearance before the Sun riſing and after its ſetting. Our Faith reſpects a Saviour that has already come, theirs reſpect him as yet to come.</p>
            <p>NOW the <hi>meritorious Cauſe</hi> of the Benefits of <hi>Propitiation</hi> and Remiſſion, is the <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Chriſt, i. e.</hi> by a Synedoche the whole <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which began in the obedience of his Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and was conſumated in his Death</p>
            <p>BUT the <hi>inſtrumental Cauſe</hi> of the Application of the aforeſaid Benefits to us, and our Inveſtiture in them is <hi>Faith,</hi> ſuch a cordial Complacence in, and entire Dependance on the Method of Salvation by the Death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as habitually attracts the Mind and Life, to the Love of <hi>Truth,</hi> and Practice of <hi>Good,</hi> both moral and evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical, <hi>whom GOD hath ſet forth to be a Propitiation thro' Faith in his Blood;</hi> and indeed the Wiſdom of the divine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution is herein apparent, that an actual Intereſt in the Benefits of CHRIST'S Death, is communicated in a way intirely conſiſtent with the <hi>Purity</hi> of GOD'S <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> of his <hi>Government.</hi> Sinners muſt firſt humble themſelves before GOD for their Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and accept the <hi>Mediator</hi> before they are forgiven. But the</p>
            <p n="3">3d. PARTICULAR in our <hi>Text,</hi> is the <hi>Deſign</hi> of <hi>GOD</hi> in our <hi>Redemption</hi> by JESUS CHRIST, and that is the <hi>Manifeſtation</hi> of his <hi>Juſtice</hi> and Righteouſneſs: <hi>Whom God hath ſet forth to be a Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation thro' Faith in his Blood to declare his Righteouſneſs. To declare I ſay at this Time his Righteouſneſs, that he might be juſt; and the Juſtifier of him that believes in JESUS.</hi> This Point is repeated with earneſtneſs by the Apoſtle, not only to ſignify its great Importance, and inexpreſſible Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but likewiſe to make the deeper Impreſſion by it upon our <hi>Minds.</hi> The <hi>Juſtice</hi> of GOD is that Perfection of his <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> whereby he is inclined to render every one his <hi>Due:</hi> That at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute whereby he is diſpoſed to hate Sin, and puniſh Sinners ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Demerit; now of this the bleſſed GOD has given a glorious but awful Demonſtration, in the Sufferings of CHRIST; by condemning and puniſhing Sin, in the Perſon of his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten and dearly beloved Son; hereby the Almighty ſhews before the whole World, the Inflexibleneſs and Severity of his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and that he will not ſuffer Sin to paſs unpuniſhed.</p>
            <p>FROM the Words of our Text thus explain'd, I would obſerve
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006426_0005_1028E4882AD45EE8"/>
the following Propoſition, <hi>viz. That the Juſtice of GOD is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly manifeſt, or declared in the Redemption of Man, by the Death of JESUS CHRIST:</hi> Altho' GOD ſpared guilty Man for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his <hi>Mercy,</hi> yet he ſpared not his own <hi>Son,</hi> when he be came the Sinner's <hi>Surety,</hi> for the Honour of his <hi>Juſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN ſpeaking upon this Propoſition I would,</p>
            <p n="1">I. OPEN <hi>the</hi> Nature <hi>of GOD's</hi> Juſtice. And,</p>
            <p n="2">II. SHEW <hi>how it is gloriouſly manifeſt in the</hi> Redemption <hi>of Man by the</hi> Death <hi>of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, and then proceed to the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of GOD, is that eternal <hi>Rectitude</hi> of the <hi>divine Nature,</hi> whereby he orders and diſpoſes all Things, according to the <hi>Rules</hi> that his infinite Wiſdom has preſcribed; and governs all Mankind with the utmoſt Exactneſs and Impartiality in Relation to the Diſtribution of <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Puniſhments;</hi> to illuſtrate this we ſhould obſerve, that there is an intrinſick RECTITUDE and ODDI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QUITY in Things, and that the Reaſons and Relations of moral Good and Evil, do not depend upon any uncertain and arbitrary Principle; but are fixed and immutable, indiſpenſable, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> purſuant to this, that <hi>Truth, Goodneſs,</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> are eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and neceſſary Properties, in the divine Nature; antecedent to any Conſideration of the divine Will; and what he can no more alter or unſettle, than he can deny himſelf or ceaſe to be; that as he is the Maker and Governor of the World, he has an undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Authority to make <hi>Laws,</hi> and enforce them with proper <hi>Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> that when Laws are thus enacted, he ſetts Bounds in ſome Meaſure to his own Authority; for Juſtice requires that he ſhould not preſcribe what is above Man's Strength, or if he does, that he ſhould give ſupernatural Power to obey it; that upon Obedience he cannot without Prejudice to his Juſtice, deny the promis'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or, upon Diſobedience, finally forbear to inflict the threatned Puniſhment: And from hence it follows, that GOD is neceſſarily obliged, both by his Nature and Covenant, to act with the ſtricteſt Juſtice and Impartiality, in all his Proceedings with Man: But I proceed to the</p>
            <p n="2">II. Propos'd, Which was to ſhew how divine Juſtice is gloriouſly manifeſt, in the Redemption of Man, by the Death of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Now the Particular in which, or Manner how divine <hi>Juſtice</hi> is glorify'd by the Death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is the Satisfaction that has been made thereto by it. In order to open this important and FUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DAMENTAL POINT, of the CHRISTIAN RELIGION, and give it its juſt Weight, let me endeavour to repreſent,</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE indiſpenſable <hi>Neceſſity</hi> there was of a <hi>Satisfaction</hi> to Juſtice, in order to our <hi>Redemption</hi> and <hi>Salvation.</hi> And,</p>
            <p n="2">2. EVINCE the <hi>Reality</hi> and <hi>Sufficiency</hi> of that which <hi>Chriſt</hi> has made thereto by his <hi>Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW the Neceſſity of a Satisfaction to <hi>divine Juſtice</hi> in order to our Redemption and Salvation, appears from the Conſideration of the Nature of GOD, and his Relation to intelligent Creatures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:006426_0006_1028E48B1F707640"/>
               <hi>JUSTICE</hi> being a natural and neceſſary <hi>Perfection</hi> of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Nature,</hi> hath conſequently an invariable Reſpect to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Qualities of intelligent <hi>Beings,</hi> as divine Goodneſs in ſome Degree naturally and neceſſarily diffuſes itſelf upon Agents, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly pure and innocent, ſo likewiſe Juſtice terminates upon the Guilty and Nocent by Puniſhments equal to their Crimes; except a Satisfaction intervene. If it be impoſſible conſidering the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Diety that Holineſs ſhould be unrewarded, then ſurely it muſt be more impoſſible that Sin ſhould be unpuniſhed; ſeeing the Exerciſe of Juſtice is more neceſſary than that of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; for the Rewards which Goodneſs diſpenſes are pure Favour, inaſmuch as the Creature has received it's Being, and all its Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits from GOD, all the Services it can perform, are due to him on account hereof, and if ſo, by the Payment of a juſt Debt, they cannot merit freſh Benefits; but the Puniſhments which Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice inflicts are due and demerited, for violating the Rights of Heaven, and all the Obligations they are laid under to GOD; ſeeing <hi>Juſtice</hi> in it's Nature is a Perfection, it muſt of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence be in GOD, who is poſſeſs'd of all kinds of Excellency, and that in the higheſt Degree of Eminence, or infinitely, and if ſo it is inflexible and eternal.</p>
            <p>SIN is directly contrary to the divine <hi>Purity,</hi> and therefore he muſt as neceſſarily hate it, as he loves himſelf; this is evident from the Law of Contraries, as well as from the Pſalmiſt's Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>The righteous Lord loveth Righteouneſs, but the Wicked his Soul hateth.</hi> Now <hi>Puniſhment</hi> is but a natural Effect, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Manifeſtation of this <hi>Hatred;</hi> and therefore it is not an arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Conſtituion; it is true, the Time and Manner of it's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction is founded in divine <hi>Sovereignty,</hi> but the <hi>Matter</hi> or <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> of it is bottom'd on the eſſential <hi>Purity</hi> and Rectitude of the divine <hi>Nature</hi> to which Sin is repugnant.</p>
            <p>BUT if together with what has been offered, reſpecting the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature; we conſider the Relation <hi>Jehovah</hi> bears to the moral World, it adds much Light and Force to this Argument.</p>
            <p>ALMIGHTY GOD in the Character of a <hi>Governor,</hi> is obliged to protect the Laws of his Government from Reproach and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult.</p>
            <p>AS it was proper and neceſſary, that the reaſonable Creature ſhould have a <hi>Law</hi> to direct it, in that <hi>Homage</hi> and Service, which it had a Capacity to perform to its Creator and Sovereign.</p>
            <p>SO it is highly reaſonable that the aforeſaid <hi>Law</hi> ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by ſuch important Sanctions, as were neceſſary to procure the Creature's Obedience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>SIN</hi> being the greateſt moral <hi>Evil,</hi> becauſe oppoſite to the greateſt moral <hi>Good</hi> the bleſſed GOD, it is but ſuitable that it ſhould be puniſhed with the greateſt penal Evil, <hi>viz.</hi> Death.</p>
            <p>NOW the <hi>Law</hi> being broken, was it not juſt and neceſſary, that the Penalty threatned ſhould be inflicted, either upon the Tranſgreſſor himſelf, according to the immediate Intent of the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:006426_0007_1028E48DB6595480"/>
               <hi>Law,</hi> or upon ſuch a <hi>Surety</hi> in his room, as was able to make Satisfaction equivalent to the Offence; that ſo the <hi>Majeſty, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of GOD might be rendered conſpicuous, as well as the Value he puts upon Obedience to his <hi>Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF the Penalty threatened be not inflicted, upon a proper Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, does it not reflect either upon his WISDOM, as if he had not with good Reaſon concerted the SANCTION, or upon his POWER, as if he was not able to inflict it, or upon his PURITY, as tho' he conniv'd with Tranſgreſſors; or upon his TRUTH, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as his Word is not perform'd. And would not Sinners be hereby induced to contemn the Law and the Lawgiver, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd in their Impieties? All which Conſiderations plainly prove the Neceſſity of Satisfaction for the Breach of GOD'S Laws; without this, GOD'S Hatred againſt Sin would not be declared, nor the <hi>Honour</hi> of his <hi>Laws</hi> preſerved, nor a ſuitable <hi>Fear</hi> of offending him awak'd, every of which are neceſſary and excellent: It is true, temporal Magiſtrates are ſometimes obliged to diſpenſe with the Law, and ſpare an Offender, either thro' inabillity to puniſh him, or becauſe his Life may be of more Service to the State; and ſtill there is a ſuperior Tribunal, to which the Caſe either is, or ought to be referred; but GOD'S Government is very different, no Criminal can either eſcape his Notice, byaſs his Juſtice, or controul his Power; here is no Exigency of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that requires Impunity, no ſuperior <hi>Tribunal:</hi> Moreover the <hi>Majeſty</hi> of theſe <hi>Laws</hi> is more ſacred than that of Civil States and Kingdoms. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. I am to evince the <hi>Reality</hi> and <hi>Sufficiency</hi> of that <hi>Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> which CHRIST paid to divine <hi>Juſtice</hi> by his Death. And to this End, it will be neceſſary to conſider the PREQUISITES in order to it; and the Account the ſacred Scriptures give of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Death,</hi> together with the CONSEQUENTS thereof.</p>
            <p>NOW in order to Satisfaction, theſe Things were previouſly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, <hi>viz.</hi> The perſonal <hi>Holineſs</hi> of the <hi>Mediator;</hi> his being <hi>poſſeſs'd</hi> of the divine and human <hi>Natures;</hi> his <hi>Appointment</hi> to undertake this Province, and his <hi>Conſent</hi> thereto.</p>
            <p>HE that ſatisfies for another's Sin muſt be without Sin himſelf, for guilty Blood is impure and conſequently ſtains by its Effuſion rather than cleanſes: Now the Lord JESUS was holy, harmleſs, undefiled, ſeparate from Sinners, he appeared to take away Sin and in him was no Sin: To prevent his Infection with original Sin propogated by natural Generation, he was conceived in a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Manner, by the Power of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> according to the Angel's Declaration, <hi>The Holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee, and the Power of the higheſt ſhall overſhadow thee, therefore alſo that holy Thing that ſhall be born of thee ſhall be called the Son of GOD.</hi> And as he was perfectly free from original, ſo likewiſe from actual Sin; Satan, when he came found nothing in him, to faſten his Temptation upon; and therefore was baffled in all his Stratagems; tho' he came in the likeneſs of ſinful Fleſh, yet he had no Sin:
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:006426_0008_1028E493F49AE758"/>
juſt as the brazen Serpent had the Figure, but not the Venom of the fiery Serpent: Our Lord fulfilled all Righteouſnes, and ever did what pleaſed his Father.</p>
            <p>NAY our Lord was not only free from Sin, but it was impoſſible that he ſhould be tainted with it, becauſe of the intimate Union of his human Nature with the divine; the divine Nature being Holineſs itſelf, and Almighty Power, muſt needs by its Preſence and Union inſallibly prevent Sin in the Redeemer.</p>
            <p>BUT it was not only neceſſary that the MEDIATOR ſhould be perſonally holy, in order to make Satisfaction, but likewiſe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd of the divine and human Natures: He muſt aſſume the Nature of Man, that he might be ally'd to him, and capable of ſuffering in his ſtead, for the Deity cannot ſuffer. Under the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Oeconomy, the Right of Redemption belong'd to him that was next in Blood; hence our Lord took upon him the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he might have a Right of Propinquity or near Alliance as Man, to redeem us, and be capable to make Satisfaction for us in the ſame Nature that ſinn'd.</p>
            <p>NOR was it leſs neceſſary that the MEDIATOR ſhould be GOD, that ſo the human Nature might be ſupported under its Sufferings, and they made of infinite Value, and ſo equivalent to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit of Sin. JUSTICE required an exact Proportion between the Guilt of Sin, and the Satisfaction made for it, which could not be, if the <hi>Mediator</hi> had not been <hi>GOD.</hi> The Guilt of Sin is doubtleſs infinite, becauſe committed againſt an infinite GOD, but the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of any finite Nature can be but finite in Meaſure and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue; and there was an abſolute Neceſſity of a Union of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and human Natures, in the Perſon of the <hi>Mediator,</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate an infinite <hi>Dignity</hi> to his Sufferings: By Reaſon of this Union there is a Communication of the ſpecial Properties of both <hi>Natures</hi> to the <hi>Perſon</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which being properly the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of his Actions, muſt needs communicate an infinite Merit and Dignity to them all, and hence it is ſaid, that <hi>the Lord of Glory was crucified;</hi> and that we are <hi>purchaſed by the Blood of GOD,</hi> the human Nature being united to the divine, the Actions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from it, are not meerly human, but rais'd above their natural Worth, and therefore meritorious and infinitely excellent: One Hour of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Life glorified GOD, more than Millions of Ages ſpent in his Service by Men and Angels, becauſe this being done by Creatures, can be but finite and limited; but the other being the Obedience of one who is GOD, is of infinite Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and worthy of GOD: <hi>He that</hi> comes from <hi>above, is above all;</hi> the ſame may ſaid of his Sufferings.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER <hi>Pre-requiſite</hi> to Satisfaction, is the <hi>Mediators Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to undertake this Province; without this his Mediation would have been in vain, being deſtitute of ſufficient Authority. Now the Scriptures plainly and poſitively declare our Lord's Appointment to the mediatorial Work, in theſe Words <hi>for him hath GOD the Father ſealed,</hi> GOD anointed <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:006426_0009_1028E496D122A090"/>
Ghoſt, and with Power, the Lord hath ſworn and will not repent, thou art a Prieſt forever after the Order of</hi> Melchizedek. <hi>Therefore doth my Father love me, becauſe I lay down my Life, this Commandment I have received of my Father.</hi> Theſe Scriptures and many others that might be mentioned, do ſufficiently ſhew <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Authority and Commiſſion to mediate.</p>
            <p>GOD the Father in this Conſtitution, is to be conſidered as a Governor, who by an Act of Supremacy and pure Juriſdiction, may diſpenſe with the Execution of the Law, upon ſuch Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, as fully anſwer the Ends of Government.</p>
            <p>THE Law is not executed according to the Letter of it, for that obliges the Perſon that Sins to ſuffer, and if the Caſe were ſo no Fleſh could be ſaved; nor is it diſannull'd, for if ſo no Obligation to Duty or Penalty would remain, but all Men are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to obey, and thoſe who impenitently neglect it, are under a Curſe, it is therefore only relax'd in regard of its Penalty, by a merciful Condeſcenſion of the Lawgiver.</p>
            <p>IT is true the <hi>Moral Law</hi> cannot be relaxed, in reſpect of its <hi>Precept;</hi> for that being a <hi>Copy</hi> of the divine <hi>Purity,</hi> the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty cannot deny himſelf by contradicting it, or allowing what is intrinſically Evil; nor can it be relaxed in Reſpect of the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> and Weight of its Penalty in general, becauſe of the <hi>Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> of GOD engaged to iſſue the ſame.</p>
            <p>YET that the Penalty may be relaxed, as to the Perſon of the Sinner, for wiſe and juſt Reaſons, is evident by conſidering, that it is not the Evil of the Offender, that is primarily deſigned by it, but the Honour of the Lawgiver, and the Preſervation of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Order and Government; in caſe therefore thoſe valuable Ends can be attain'd, by ſubſtituting a Surety in the Place of the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor to ſuffer for him; the End of the Law is anſwered.</p>
            <p>ALTHO' the Threatning declared the Demerit of Sin in the Tranſgreſſor, and the Right of Puniſhing in the Creator and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, yet it cannot vacate GOD'S Power to relax it upon juſt and wiſe Reaſons; otherwiſe it would be abſurd and inconſiſtent with his Supremacy.</p>
            <p>THE laſt <hi>Pre-requiſite</hi> that I mentioned, was the REDEEMERS <hi>Conſent</hi> to the Fathers Appointment; this was neceſſary to make his Sufferings ſatisfactory; for being GOD himſelf he could not be compelled by any ſuperior Authority<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> its true, after he had undertaken, he was then obliged to pay the Debt; but his firſt Engagement was altogether free and of Choice.</p>
            <p>AND ſeeing that the <hi>Vertue</hi> of his Sufferings does not ariſe meerly from the Dignity of his Perſon, but from his Subſtitution in our ſtead, this rendered his Conſent likewiſe neceſſary; his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings for others without his Conſent, if he could have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd thereto, would have been liable to the Charge of Injuſtice; and therefore the Scriptures expreſsly declare his willingneſs to undertake the Buſineſs of Mediation, Burnt-offering, and Sin-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou didſt not require, <hi>then ſaid I, lo I come, in the Volumn
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:006426_0010_1028E4988C551EA8"/>
of the Book it is written of me,</hi> I <hi>delight to do thy Will, O my God, yea, thy Law is within my Heart.</hi> And hence it is ſaid, that he <hi>gave himſelf for us;</hi> and that on this Account, the <hi>Father loved him, becauſe he laid down his Life;</hi> theſe Paſſages of Scripture do ſufficiently manifeſt <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s free, and full Conſent to the Fathers Appointment, of his undertaking to be our Surety.</p>
            <p>NOW having ſpoken of the Pre-requiſites neceſſary in order to Satisfaction; it is proper to diſcourſe on the Account which the Scriptures give of the Redeemer's Death, to the End we may know whether it was ſatisfactory or not, and to ſhew how divine Juſtice is therein glorified. Now the Scriptures repreſent the Death of CHRIST under a threefold Character, <hi>viz.</hi> as a Puniſhment inflicted for Sin, as a Price to redeem us from Ruin, and as a Sacrifice to reconcile us to God. And</p>
            <p n="1">1. IT is repreſented as a Puniſhment for Sin, this will appear by conſidering,</p>
            <p>THAT Man on account of his Tranſgreſſion, was ſentenced by the Law he broke to Death; and being inſolvent, the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> by his Father's Appointment and his own Conſent, engaged as a Surety to pay the Debt; and hence he is call'd the Surety of a better Covenant, and he is ſaid to be made under the Law, that we might obtain the Adoption of Sons; he who was God over all bleſſed forever, was in reſpect of his human Nature, and as Mediator, ſubject to its Precepts, and liable to its Penalties, that by performing the one and ſuſtaining the other, he might redeem thoſe that were under the Law.</p>
            <p>THE Debt we ow'd was not pecuniary but penal, a Creditor may forgive the former without Payment, becauſe it is his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, but the latter cannot be forgiven without the Prince's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, who is Guardian of the <hi>Laws,</hi> becauſe publick Juſtice is concerned in it.</p>
            <p>JESUS CHRIST having aſſum'd the Relation of a SURETY, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came one with the Debtor, in the Judgment of the <hi>Law;</hi> and ſo was liable to their Puniſhment according to <hi>Juſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND this Puniſhment the Scriptures aſſure us, GOD as a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame Judge inflicted upon him; and hence he is ſaid to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up by the Determinate Council of GOD, and that the Lord laid upon him the Iniquities of us all, that is the Guilt of them, and Puniſhment due for them. It is farther ſaid, that it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, and elſewhere that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was cut of but not for himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he was wounded for our Tranſgreſſions, bruis'd for our Iniquities, that the Chaſtiſement of our Peace was laid upon him, and that by his Stripes we are heal'd; that he himſelf bare our Sins on his own Body on the Tree. Moreover the Sufferings CHRIST endur'd, were anſwerable to the Penalty the Law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd, in Subſtance, the Death threatn'd was both Temporal and Spiritual, and thus our Lord, not only bore a Temporal Death, accompanied with great Diſhonour, and exquiſite Anguiſh, but likewiſe with the Curſe of GOD, and he alſo bore the Wrath of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:006426_0011_1028E49B8BA896B0"/>
               <hi>Jehovah</hi> upon his Soul, and hence he is ſaid to <hi>tread the Wine Preſs of it alone:</hi>— The FEAR and SORROW of CHRIST at the approach of his Sufferings as well as his BLOODY SWEAT and Lamentation under them, ſhew'd that he endur'd ſomething more terrible then all outward Torments, for the Martyrs have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd ſuch with triumph, and ſurely our Redeemer cou'd not have leſs courage then they, who was the Source of their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; the Difference then muſt be in the Nature of their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, GOD the Father dealt with him as our SURETY, and not as his own SON; and therefore ſuſpended a comfortable Senſe of his Love, and appear'd as a ſevere inexorable Judge: Now from the aforeſaid Account of the Sufferings of CHRIST, it is evident they were PENAL; ſeeing they were inflicted for Sin by the Supreme Judge, and were equivalent to the Sentence of the Law, and we receive ſpiritual and ſpecial Benefits by them.</p>
            <p>IN <hi>Chriſt's Sufferings</hi> we may obſerve the <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Ends</hi> of Puniſhment. The <hi>Matter</hi> of <hi>Puniſhment</hi> is ſomething afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, either privative in being deprived of ſome good, or poſitive in enduring ſomething grievous, both which <hi>Chriſt</hi> bore. The <hi>form</hi> of Puniſhment is when it is Inflicted for Sin, and this diſtinguiſhes it from a Calamity. Now <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſuffer'd Death for Sin not his own, and hence he is ſaid to bear our Sins, to be delivered up to Death for our Sins, yea, to be made Sin and a Curſe for US. The <hi>End</hi> of <hi>Puniſhment</hi> is the common good, partly in deterring Perſons from violating the Laws, which is the deſign of exemplary Puniſhment, and partly in maintaining the Honour and Intereſt of thoſe who have ſuffered by the Breach of the Laws, this is the Deſign of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory Puniſhment, anſwerable to which in the <hi>Death</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Severity there expreſs'd is to deter from Sin, and maintain the Honour of the great Lord of the Univerſe, by making com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation for the Injury done againſt him by Sin.</p>
            <p>2dly. THE DEATH of CHRIST is repreſented in Scripture as the PRICE of our <hi>Redemption: Redemption</hi> in general is a deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one from a Calamity by a <hi>Ranſom, i. e.</hi> Some valuable Conſideration, which is term'd a Price; to underſtand which let it be conſidered, that Man by Diſobedience to GOD was bro't into Miſery, ſuch Miſery as the Scripture often expreſſes by Captivity, which conſiſts in a ſervile Subjection to Satan and Death, to which Man was as it were committed for his Rebellion by the Supreame Judge and Governor; from this Calamity Men could no otherwiſe be delivered then by Ranſom, for by Order of Divine Juſtice we were detain'd Priſoners, and till this was Satisfy'd, no Diſcharge could be obtain'd; freedom from a Calamity without a Price is Deliverance ſimply, but not properly Redemption: The Word Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption to which the Scriptures aſcribe our eſcape <hi>(apolutroſis)</hi> ſignifies Deliverance by a Ranſom; and hence it is ſaid, <hi>that CHRIST gave himſelf a Ranſom for all, (antilutron)</hi> This Word is exceeding Emphatical, and ſignifies a Ranſom paid inſtead of another. <hi>Anti</hi> denotes Subſtitution, when a Thing or
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:006426_0012_1028E4A25953B038"/>
Perſon is put in the Place of another; many Inſtances might eaſily be given of this, ſo that the Meaning of the aforeſaid Words, he gave himſelf a Ranſon for many, is this, that he died in their ſtead, and by his Life as a Price obtained their Redemption; which Truth the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> elſewhere confirms, by ſaying that <hi>Chriſt</hi> has Redeem'd us from the Curſe of the Law, being made a Curſe for us; the Price upon Conſideration of which we are Redeem'd, <hi>is not corruptable Things ſuch as Silver and Gold, but the precious Blood of CHRIST as of a Lamb without blemiſh and without Spot,</hi> this Price was paid in our ſtead to GOD, for it was for Sin againſt his Majeſty, that we were caſt into Miſery, and by his Righteous Order detained in it; and therefore to him the Price of our acquitance muſt be paid; Satan is no more then an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of his Juſtice: If CHRIST had died only for the Confirmation of the Goſpel, or to exhibit to us a Patern of Suffering, as the <hi>Socinians</hi> imagine, then what was there in his Death more than in the Death of other Martyrs, and how can we be ſaid to be <hi>redeem'd</hi> by it? Would it not be as ridiculous as blaſphemous to ſay, that we are redeemed by their Death? But</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE <hi>Death</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is repreſented in Scripture, as a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to reconcile us to God; him Jehovah <hi>has ſet forth to be a Propitiation thro' Faith in his Blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT the <hi>Death</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was a true and real <hi>Sacrifice</hi> appears not only from the expreſs Declaration of Scripture, but from all the Ingredients of a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> being found in it, Chriſt <hi>our Paſſover,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle to the <hi>Corinthians, is ſacrificed for us;</hi> and in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> he informs us, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath appeared once in the End of the World to put away Sin by the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of himſelf.</p>
            <p>ONE <hi>Ingredient</hi> of a real and proper <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> was that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon offering muſt be a Prieſt, <hi>every high Prieſt,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>taken from among Men is ordained for Men in Things pertaining to God, that he may offer both Gifts and Sacrifices for Sins;</hi> and was not <hi>Chriſt</hi> conſtitued a Prieſt by Oath after the Order of <hi>Melchizedeck.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AGAIN, The Things offered were to be of God's appointment, otherwiſe it was but Will-worſhip, even in freewill Offerings, tho' the Time of Offering was not fixed, yet the Things to be Offered were appointed; and thus was not what CHRIST offered, appointed and prepared by God, <hi>a Body haſt thou prepared me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; this Body was animated with a Soul, which being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated therefrom in his Death, is ſaid to be <hi>made an Offering for Sin,</hi> by the Royal Prophet; and elſewhere he is ſaid to <hi>offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> i. e. both his Soul and Body, (<hi>Heb.</hi> ix.)</p>
            <p>FARTHER, that which was offered for a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> was to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd; thoſe Things that had life were kill'd, and their Blood pour'd out, and the other Parts beſides the Blood were burnt, either wholy or in part: Thus our Lord was ſlain and his Blood ſhed, and his Soul was expoſed to his Fathers Wrath. And as the Jewiſh <hi>Sacrifices</hi> were burnt without the Camp: Thus did not JESUS ſuffer <hi>without the Gates of Jeruſalem.</hi> Moreover,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006426_0013_1028E4A52A429A80"/>
               <hi>Sacrifices</hi> were offered to God only, and hence the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> terms them <hi>Things pertaining to God:</hi> And did not JESUS CHRIST, thro the eternal Spirit, offer himſelf <hi>without Spot to God,</hi> (<hi>Heb,</hi> ix. 14.)</p>
            <p>FROM the aforeſaid Particulars it appears, that all the <hi>Ingredients</hi> or <hi>Conſtituents,</hi> of a real <hi>Sacrifice</hi> are found in the Sacrifice of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HAVING already ſhewn that CHRIST'S Death was a <hi>real Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> I would proceed to aſſert and prove, that it was a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Propitiation</hi> or <hi>Attonement</hi> and <hi>Reconciliation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TO this End obſerve, that the <hi>Propitiatory Sacrifices</hi> under the Jewiſh OEconomy, were figures and ſhadows of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Now if the Types and Shadows had any propitiatory Vertue in them, much more the Antitype, elſe the Subſtance would not exceed the Shadow, which is abſurd. That the Jewiſh <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi> did prefigure the Death of Chriſt, the Apoſtle declares at large in the ninth and tenth Chapters to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and in the ſecond Chapter of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſians,</hi> where he calls them <hi>Figures and Shadows of good Things to come:</hi> but in the mean Time ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, that <hi>the Body is of</hi> Chriſt; as if he ſhould ſay, thoſe Propitiatory Jewiſh Sacrifices had ſome reſemblance of this, as the ſhadow has of the Body, tho' obſcure and imperfect; but the Subſtance and Perfection of Atonement is in the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT to make this very important Point more evident, let me endeavour to prove, that all that was abſolutely neceſſary to a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of Propitiation under the Jewiſh OEconomy, is to be found in the Sacrifice of Chriſt, <hi>e. g.</hi> The Sin of the Offender was laid upon the Sacrifice, and likewiſe his Puniſhment was inflicted upon it, the Sacrifice was ſubſtituted in his Room, apeaſed the Almighty, and removed the Sinners guilt.</p>
            <p>EACH of theſe Particulars deſerves and requires our Attention. The Sin of the Offender was laid upon the Sacrifice, or imputed to it and charged upon it, ſo as to be made reſponſible and liable to ſuffer for it, as if it had contracted the Guilt itſelf; even as a Surety is obliged to pay a Debt he never contracted, yea as much as if he had: The <hi>Sacrifice</hi> was look'd upon and treated as a guilty Thing, tho' it had not ſin'd itſelf; hence theſe <hi>Sacrifices</hi> were called <hi>Sins,</hi> (<hi>Levit.</hi> xx. 17.) which is tranſlated <hi>Sin-Offering.</hi> Farther they are ſaid to bear the Iniquities of the People, (<hi>Levit.</hi> xvi. 22.) <hi>and the Goat ſhall bear upon him all their Iniquities.</hi> We are farther informed in the aforeſaid Chapter, that the People laid their Hands upon the Head of the Sacrifice, confeſſed their Sins over him, and put their Sins upon him; <hi>and</hi> Aaron <hi>ſhall lay both his Hands upon the Head of the live Goat, and confeſs over him all the Iniquities of the Children of Iſrael.</hi> Putting them upon the Head of the Goat, ſignified, ſay the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Maſters, that the Guilt was transferred from the People to the Sacrifice that was offered for them. And hence the Scape Goat, and other Propitiatory Sacrifices, were look'd upon as execrable and poluted Things; and thoſe that touch'd them were poluted. (<hi>Levit.</hi> xxvi.)
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:006426_0014_1028E4A7CA391C78"/>
Now as the Sin was charged upon and imputed to the legal Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, ſo our Sins were charged upon and imputed to JESUS CHRIST, as the Apoſtle obſerves to the <hi>Corinthians, he was made Sin for us who knew no Sin, that we might be made the Righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi> How could he be made Sin who knew none, any other way than by Imputation? And how can his Righteouſneſs, who is God, be made ours by any other Method? Sin was imputed to Chriſt when it was charged upon him, and he obliged to ſuffer for it in our ſtead; as a Debt may be ſaid to be imputed to a Surety when he takes it upon himſelf, and is thereby obliged to pay it, tho' he never contracted it; and <hi>Chriſt's Righteouſneſs</hi> is imputed to us when it is accepted for us, and we as realy entitled to its Benefits as tho' we had perform'd it. Moreover,</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Penalty</hi> of the Offender was laid upon the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> offered for him; the Sinner deſerved temporal Death and Deſtruction, and the Sacrifice was ſlain or deſtroy'd. A Bullock, which was a Sin-Offerring for the High-Prieſt, and a Goat, which was a Sin-Offering for the People, were ordered to be killed, and the Scape Goat was ſent into the Wilderneſs to be deſtroy'd one way or other. (<hi>See Levit.</hi> xvi) And in like manner the Sin-Offerings for private Perſons whether Lambs, Kids, Turtle-Doves, or Young Pidegons, were to be ſlain, and the Offering of Flour was to be partly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed. (<hi>Levit.</hi> v.)</p>
            <p>THE Sacrifices, by having the Sins of the People laid upon them, became liable to the Penalty, and did actually under go it: Thus it was with <hi>Chriſt</hi> whom they pointed to; <hi>he himſelf,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Peter, bare our Sins in his own Body on the Tree, by whoſe ſtripes we are healed; he was bruiſed for our Iniquities,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>wounded for our Tranſgreſſions, and poured out his Soul unto Death.</hi> Farther,</p>
            <p>THE Sacrifice ſuffered the aforeſaid Penalties in the Offenders room and place, and this indeed neceſſarily follows from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars beforementioned, for to ſuffer in one's ſtead is nothing elſe but to ſuffer for another what he ſhould have ſuffered, that he may eſcape; thus the Sacrifice ſuffered Death for the Offender that he might not die, and therefore dy'd in his ſtead, its Life went for his Life, <hi>Levit.</hi> xvii. 11. <hi>For the Life of the Fleſh is in the Blood, and I have given it to you upon the Altar to make an Atonement.</hi> The Blood being the Vehickle of Life, when it goes, the Life goes; this therefore being offered to attone for them, or ſave their Lives, of Conſequence the Life of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice went inſtead of the Life of the Offender.</p>
            <p>AND if, as has been before proved, both the Sin and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Offender were laid upon the Sacrifice, it muſt needs ſuffer in his room and place; but for farther Illuſtration of this important Point of the Subſtitution of the Sacrifice in the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors room, it may be obſerved, that no Sacrifices were inſtituted for Capital Offences, ſuch as Murder, Idolatry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe the Sinner himſelf was to be cut off; but for other Sins which tho'
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:006426_0015_1028E4B12446F4F0"/>
they in ſtrictneſs according to that Diſpenſation, deſerved Death, yet God was pleaſed to relax the Penalty of the Law in Reſpect of the Tranſgreſſor, and accept of the Life of the Sacrifice for his Life: Agreeable hereto the guilty Perſon was to offer a clean Beaſt of his own, to ſignify its Subſtitution in his ſtead, for as Proprietor he had a Dominion over it to apply it to that Uſe.</p>
            <p>WELL; if there was in the Sacrifices of Attonement a Subſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Sacrifice in the Offender's room, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> was ſuch a Sacrifice as has been proved, then it neceſſarily follows that he died not only for our Good, but in our room and place, ſeeing he is the Subſtance and Anti-type to which thoſe Shadows pointed, and in whom they have their Accompliſhment; and hence he is ſaid <hi>to die for the Ungodly,</hi> and to ſuffer the juſt for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt that he might bring us to GOD, juſt as the innocent Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in the room of the guilty Tranſgreſſor, not only the original Words in thoſe Scriptures <hi>Huper</hi> and <hi>Anti,</hi> but the Things ſpoken of manifeſtly declare a Subſtitution of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Place of Sinners as a Sacrifice of Propitiation.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, <hi>propitiatory Sacrifices</hi> were to appeaſe God and turn away his Anger, this is the Meaning of the Word <hi>Attonement,</hi> which was the Deſign of the <hi>Sin-Offerings,</hi> the <hi>Treſpaſs-Offerings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and the <hi>Burnt-Offerings,</hi> Levit. vii. 7. and i. 4. <hi>And he ſhall put his Hand upon the Head of the Burnt-Offering, and it ſhall be accepted for him to make Attonement for him.</hi> And this was alſo the Deſign of the <hi>Peace-Offerings,</hi> and this End thoſe Sacri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fices attained, many Examples of this Kind might be offered but I ſhall only, for brevity's ſake, mention one, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> xxiv. ult. <hi>And</hi> David <hi>offered Burnt-Offerings and Peace-Offerings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo the Lord was intreated for the Land, and the Plague was ſtayed from</hi> Iſrael. Becauſe the Lord by thoſe Sacrifices was rendered propitious or well pleaſed, therefore they are frequently ſaid to be of a <hi>ſweet ſavour to the Lord,</hi> Levit. i. <hi>Noah</hi>'s Sacrifice is ſaid to be <hi>a ſavour of Reſt,</hi> as it is in the Margin, <hi>Gen.</hi> viii. 21. on which Occaſion <hi>God</hi> ſaid <hi>he would not curſe the Ground any more for Man</hi>'s <hi>ſake.</hi> It is call'd a ſavour of Reſt, becauſe when <hi>God</hi> is pacify'd, his Anger reſts, <hi>Ezek.</hi> xvi. 42. Hence thoſe Sacrifices are call'd <hi>propitiatory.</hi> The Words <hi>Propitiation, Attonement, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, Pacifying,</hi> are ſynonimous Terms, and ſignify one and the ſame Thing.</p>
            <p>NOW the ſame Words and Effects are aſcribed to the Sacrifice of <hi>Chriſt</hi> (or to his <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> which is the ſame) in our Text he is ſaid to be a <hi>Propitiatory thro' Faith in his Blood,</hi> by him, ſays the Apoſtle to the <hi>Romans, we have received the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement, Rom.</hi> xi. He is called our <hi>Peace, Epheſ.</hi> ii. 14. And the Chaſtiſement of our Peace is ſaid to be laid upon him, <hi>i. e.</hi> Puniſhments neceſſary to procure our Peace, and by his Blood and Death we are ſaid to be juſtified and reconciled. <hi>Rom.</hi> v. 9.10.</p>
            <p>PREVIOUS to this Reconciliation, Satisfaction to Juſtice was neceſſary, which implies not only the Suffering of a Calamity,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:006426_0016_1028E4B35B63A860"/>
but that in Subſtance, which the <hi>Law</hi> threatned and the Sinner deſerved. <hi>Juſtice</hi> that it may be ſatisfied requires the Execution of the <hi>Law,</hi> and the Calamity aforeſaid muſt be endured by the Sinner, and in his ſtead by another, if one ſuffers upon his own Account, that can be no Satisfaction for another, all theſe Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars we have already proved, are verified in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and in the Subſtance which they prefigured.</p>
            <p>ONCE more I may obſerve, that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sacrifices removed Guilt or Obligation to Puniſhment, here obſerve, that Guilt may be ſaid to be threefold, <hi>viz. Civil, Ceremonial,</hi> and <hi>Moral. Civil</hi> Guilt conſiſted in a liableneſs to temporal Death, for ſome viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the civil or judicial <hi>Law, Deut.</hi> xxi. 9.</p>
            <p>CEREMONIAL Guilt conſiſted in an Obligation to be debarr'd from the Privileges of publick Worſhip under the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my for ſome Breach of the ceremonial <hi>Law,</hi> for ſome legal Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, <hi>Levit.</hi> 5. But,</p>
            <p>MORAL <hi>Guilt</hi> conſiſts in an Obligation to endure eternal Death for tranſgreſſing the <hi>moral Law,</hi> for by divine Conſtitution the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of every moral Evil or Sin properly and intrinſically ſo call'd is Death; now the legal Sacrifices could free from the two former Kinds of <hi>Guilt,</hi> but the Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> alone from the latter, <hi>Heb.</hi> ix. 13, 14. <hi>For if the Blood of Goats, and Aſhes of a Heifer ſprinkling of the Unclean, ſanctifieth to the purifying of the Fleſh,</hi> i. e. promoted an external Sanctification or Expiation, as to the Fleſh, not as to the Soul and Conſcience, <hi>How much more ſhall the Blood of</hi> Chriſt <hi>purge your Conſciences from dead Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE legal Sacrifices could not make him that did the Service, perfect, as pertaining to the Conſcience, becauſe they could not compenſate the Injury Sin had done to GOD, being finite, without which, <hi>Juſtice</hi> is engaged to puniſh the Tranſgreſſor with eternal Death.</p>
            <p>THESE Sacrifices could only remove a civil and ceremonial <hi>Guilt,</hi> or liableneſs to outward Puniſhment enacted by thoſe Laws<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (in Inſtances not grounded upon the Nature and Reaſon of Things, but meerly upon divine Sovereignity;) and ſhadow forth the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which being of infinite Value is ſufficient to ſatisfy divine Juſtice, remove the Guilt of moral Impurity, and ſave the Soul: Under the Law we are told, <hi>that without the ſhedding of Blood there was no remiſſion of Sins,</hi> and the Blood is ſaid to make Attonement, <hi>Levit.</hi> xvii 11. the Reaſon is, becauſe the Life was in the Blood, and therefore when the Blood was offered to make Attonement for the Offender, the Life of the Sacrifice was ſuppos'd to be given inſtead of his Life, and thus the Sentence of the Law threatning Death was executed, and ſo <hi>Juſtice</hi> ſatisfied. For this Reaſon the Blood of the Mediator is ſaid to <hi>ſpeak better Things than the Blood of</hi> Abel, for that cry'd for Revenge, but this procures Remiſſion to Believers; and this doubtleſs is the Reaſon why ſo frequent mention is made of the Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:006426_0017_1028E4B9998595A8"/>
the <hi>New-Teſtament, viz.</hi> to ſhew that our dear Redeemer has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the <hi>Penalty</hi> of the Law, Death itſelf, and thereby ſatisfied <hi>Juſtice,</hi> magnified the <hi>Law,</hi> and made it honourable.</p>
            <p>BUT the <hi>Reality</hi> and <hi>Sufficiency</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Satisfaction to Juſtice appears, not only from what has been ſaid upon the ſcriptural Repreſentation of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Death as a Puniſhment inflicted for Sin, as a Price to redeem us from Ruin, and a Sacrifice to reconcile us to GOD, but likewiſe from the Conſideration of the Quality of the Perſon ſuffering, the Degrees of his Sufferings, and the Effects of them.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Quality</hi> of his Perſon derived an infinite Value upon his Sufferings. Our Redeemer was the true and eternal GOD, co-equal and co-eternal with his Father, <hi>the Brightneſs of his Glory, and the expreſs Image of his Perſon,</hi> the Son of GOD, not meerly by Office, but by Nature, and therefore was able to make full Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for our <hi>Sins.</hi> The <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> of all Nations agree that Puniſhments receive their Eſtimate from the Quality of the Perſons that ſuffer: Tho' the Deity is impaſſible, yet it was a divine Perſon that ſuffered, and hence his Blood is call'd the <hi>Blood of GOD,</hi> in Scripture, this made his Sufferings of infinite Worth.</p>
            <p>NOR was there any Defect in the Payment he made, we ow'd a Debt of <hi>Death</hi> to the <hi>Law,</hi> and his <hi>Life</hi> was offered up as a <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> yea, <hi>he trod the Wine-preſs of his Father</hi>'s <hi>Anger,</hi> and his divine Nature communicated an infinite Dignity to his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſo that they were in Kind, Degree, and Value, ſuited to the Sentence of the violated <hi>Law,</hi> equal to the Demerit of <hi>Sin,</hi> and conſequently ſatisfactory to divine <hi>Juſtice,</hi> provoked by it.</p>
            <p>BUT methinks, the Conſideration of the <hi>Conſequents</hi> and <hi>Effects</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Death pours more Light upon this important Subject, and clearly proves the ſufficiency of his Satisfaction to <hi>Juſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW there are theſe three Conſequences of his Death that deſerve our preſent Attention, <hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>Reſurrection</hi> from the Grave, his <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> into Heaven, and <hi>Exaltation</hi> to the Father's Right Hand.</p>
            <p>OUR Lord, in Quality of our <hi>Surety,</hi> was arreſted by <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and detain'd as Priſoner in the Grave, till he had by his Death ſatisfied the <hi>Law</hi> and paid our Debt; upon which he received a Diſcharge in his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and hence the raiſing of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is aſcribed to GOD as reconciled, <hi>Now the God of Peace, who brought again from the Dead the great Shepherd of the Sheep, thro' the Blood of the everlaſting Covenant;</hi> beſides it is aſcribed to his Blood becauſe that was the full Price of his and our Liberty. <hi>Juſtice incenſed</hi> arreſted and ſlew him, but <hi>Juſtice ſatisfied</hi> gave him a Releaſe and Acquittance, of which his <hi>Reſurrection</hi> is a clear Demonſtration.</p>
            <p>THE bleſſed <hi>Jeſus</hi> having riſen from the Dead, aſcended into Heaven as our High Prieſt, there to interceed for us: Now his Admiſſion into Heaven, after he had undertaken to be our <hi>Surety,</hi> is a full and certain Proof that he has faithfully diſcharged that
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:006426_0018_1028E4C3B906F020"/>
important Truſt, this is doubtleſs the Meaning of theſe Words of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> John xvi. 10. He <hi>ſhall convince the World of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, becauſe I go to my Father,</hi> i. e. the holy Spirit ſhall convince and perſuade Sinners of the Compleatneſs of my perſonal and media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial Righteouſneſs, by the Argument of my aſcending to and being accepted of my Father, for without this he would exclude me from his divine Preſence.</p>
            <p>AFTER the <hi>High Prieſt</hi> had offered Sacrifices without at the Altar, for the Sins of the People, he opened the Vail and entered into the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> and there offered ſweet Incenſe and the Blood of Sacrifices to render GOD propitious to them, (<hi>Levit.</hi> xvi. 14, 15.) Theſe Things were Figures of what <hi>Chriſt</hi> was to perform, the <hi>Holy of Holies</hi> was a Type of the third Heaven, as that had a double Vail which ſeparated it from the inner Temple, and the outward Court, ſo is the third Heaven ſeparated from the Earth by the double Vail of the ſtarry Heavens and airy Regions, none that was impure might enter into the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> and into Heaven, we are told that <hi>no unclean Thing can enter;</hi> there was the Throne of GOD, for as the Pſalmiſt obſerves, <hi>He dwells between the Cherubims,</hi> there the Tables of the Law, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems of divine Wiſdom and Purity, there the Cherubims the Figures of the bleſſed Angels, there the <hi>High Prieſt</hi> entered with the Blood of the Sacrifice, carrying the Names of the twelve Tribes upon his <hi>Breaſt-plate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THUS our great <hi>High Prieſt,</hi> after having by the Sacrifice of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf without the Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> attoned for the Sins of his People, entered into the eternal Sanctuary with his own Blood, <hi>bearing on his Boſom the Names of all the redeemed,</hi> and taking Poſſeſſion of Heaven for them in their Names, and there offering their Supplications to his Father, perfumed with the Incenſe of his Merits. Of this there was a miraculous ſign given at his <hi>Crucifixion,</hi> for in the Moment he expired, <hi>the Vail of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was rent from the Top to the Bottom,</hi> to ſignify that the great <hi>High Prieſt</hi> had Authority to enter into Heaven itſelf as our Surety, and that his Deſign herein was to appear in the Preſence of God for us as the Lamb ſlain, (<hi>Heb.</hi> ix. 24.)</p>
            <p>AS our LORD purchaſed <hi>Salvation</hi> for us, by the real Sacrifice of himſelf upon the Earth, ſo he applies it to us by his Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in Heaven, which is a Commemoration of that Sacrifice; and therefore he is ſaid to appear before his Father by <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> (<hi>Heb.</hi> ix.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>IF any Man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>the Righteous.</hi> His <hi>Interceſſion</hi> is attended with Majeſty and Efficacy: He does not now ſupplicate with <hi>ſtrong crying and tears,</hi> as in the Days of his Fleſh, but <hi>Wills</hi> Salvation to his People, <hi>Father I will that thoſe thou haſt given me be with me, that they may behold my Glory.</hi> Nor does his Suit ever fail of <hi>Succeſs,</hi> for it is juſt, he asks nothing but what he has bought by Blood. Moreover, he is nearly related to the eternal Father, and has an
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:006426_0019_1028E4C55214AD68"/>
inexpreſſible Intereſt in his Affection; and hence we are told, that <hi>him the Father heareth always.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FARTHER, the preſent <hi>Exaltation</hi> of our <hi>Redeemer</hi> to the higheſt Degree of Dignity, Glory and Dominion, is a certain Argument of the ſufficiency of his <hi>Satisfaction</hi> to Juſtice by his obedient Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, becauſe it was promiſed to and conferred upon him by his Father as a Reward thereof.</p>
            <p>THAT he is now advanced to the higheſt <hi>Dignity</hi> and <hi>Dominion,</hi> is evident from theſe Scriptures, (Epheſ. i.) <hi>When he raiſed him from the Dead, and ſet him at his own right Hand in heavenly Places, far above all principality and Power, and Might and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion; and every Name that is named, not only in this World but alſo in that which is to come, and hath put all Things under his Feet, and gave him to be the Head over all Things to the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT the Father promiſed to him, as <hi>Mediator,</hi> the aforeſaid Dignities as a Reward, and conſequent of his Humiliation, is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe evident from theſe Places of Scripture, (<hi>Luke</hi> xxiv. 26.) <hi>Ought not</hi> Chriſt <hi>to have ſuffered and to enter into his Glory:</hi> This doubtleſs refers to the Covenant of Redemption between the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son, before all Worlds, wherein the Son engaged to ſuffer for Sinners, and the Father promiſed to reward him for it; for without Reference had hereto, there was no Obligation either upon the Father or the Son in theſe reſpects, See alſo <hi>Phil.</hi> ii. 8.9. <hi>He humbled himſelf and became obedient unto Death; wherefore God hath alſo highly exalted him, and given him a Name which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove every Name, that at the Name of</hi> Jeſus <hi>every Knee ſhould bow.</hi> Heb. i. 3. <hi>When he had by himſelf purged our Sins, he ſat down on the right Hand of the Majeſty on high.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW ſeeing the aforeſaid Exaltation, of being Head of the Church, and Lord of the Univerſe, was promiſed to the <hi>Mediator</hi> as a Reward and Conſequent of his Sufferings and Satisfaction; foraſmuch as it is diſpenſed, it is a ſufficient Proof that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is perform'd, on which the Promiſe was ſuſpended, or in other Words, of the certainty and ſufficiency of CHRIST'S Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to Juſtice.</p>
            <p>BUT the <hi>Effects</hi> of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Death, are likewiſe Evidences of his <hi>Satisfaction</hi> by it, and therefore give farther force to this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> made nothing Perfect, all it's Sacrifices and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies could not cancel the Guilt, or cleanſe the ſtain of moral Impurity, nor open Heaven for us, all which are neceſſary to our Perfection. But CHRIST <hi>by one Offering hath perfected forever them that are ſanctified;</hi> he hath acquired for his People, acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from the Guilt of Sin, deliverance from its Stain and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and a final Admiſſion into the Imperial Paradiſe.</p>
            <p>The Death of JESUS has blotted out the Hand-Writing of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances which was contrary to us, and took it out of the Way, hailing it to his Croſs <hi>i. e.</hi> entirely cancelled the condemnatory Sentence of the Law as to Believers; for in the aforeſaid Terms there is a manifeſt alluſion to the Defacing and Deſtruction of
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:006426_0020_1028E4C7A41D6838"/>
obligatory Bonds. In the End of the World our great high Prieſt appeared to put away Sin by the Sacrifice of himſelf; <hi>his Blood cleanſeth from all Sin,</hi> and not only extends its Efficacy to all Time paſt, but will to all Time coming; and hence he is ſaid <hi>to be the ſame Yeſterday to-day and forever, able to ſave to the uttermoſt all that come to the Father by him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOR is the Death of CHRIST leſs efficacious in removing the Dominion and Stain of Sin, for by it the ſanctifying Influences of the Holy Spirit are procured, <hi>whereby we are renewed after the Image of God, and made meet for Communion with him;</hi> hence it was that <hi>Chriſt</hi> promiſed the <hi>Comforter</hi> as a conſequent of his Aſcenſion. (<hi>John</hi> xvi.) Hence we are ſaid <hi>to be ſanctifyed in</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, and <hi>to have our Robes made white in the Blood of the Lamb.</hi> (Rev. vii. 14.)</p>
            <p>AND is it not thro' the <hi>Blood of</hi> CHRIST <hi>that we have bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to enter into the holieſt?</hi> (Heb. x. 19) Which is a clear E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of the compleat <hi>Satisfaction</hi> made by it: For without this, Juſtice would never ſuffer the Privilege of the Righteous to be confered on the guilty and depraved. To this very Purpoſe the Apoſtle himſelf argues, (Heb. v. 9.) <hi>He learned Obedience by the Things which he ſuffered, and being made Perfect, he became the Author of eternal Salvation to all them that obey him.</hi> The meaning of which is, that there was Obedience to the Fathers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Sufferings, and that after he had perfected the End deſigned by them, which was <hi>Satisfaction</hi> to Juſtice, he became the Author of Happineſs to all that are believingly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to his Government and Authority.</p>
            <p>Having gone thro' the Heads of Diſcourſe propos'd; give me leave, becauſe of the inexpreſſible moment of this Subject, before I proceed to the Improvement, to offer a brief Anſwer to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Objections that are made againſt the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Socinians</hi> object, that it is a Violation of Juſtice to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Puniſhment of one to another.</p>
            <p>I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> It is ſo in ſome Caſes, but not in all, <hi>e. g.</hi> When the Perſon puniſhed has not Power to diſpoſe of his Life, does not conſent to the Puniſhment, and no valuable End can be anſwered by it, then it is no doubt unjuſt to transfer the Puniſhment upon him. But on the Contrary, when he has Power to diſpoſe of his Life, conſents thereto, and a valuable End can be anſwered thereby, it is not unjuſt.</p>
            <p>NOW every of theſe Things are applicable to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> He had full Power to diſpoſe of his Life, and freely conſented to his Death, (<hi>John</hi> x. 18.) <hi>I lay down my life, no Man taketh it from me, I have Power to lay it down and Power to take it again;</hi> nor was it poſſible he ſhould be held under the Power of Death, (<hi>Act.</hi> ii. 24.) otherwiſe no doubt it would have been unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for ſuch a one as he to endure it, for worthleſs rebels.</p>
            <p>MOREOVER, an infinite Good reſults from his Death; God is hereby glorified, and guilty Sinners ſaved, and the great Ends of Government anſwered.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:006426_0021_1028E4CA402CC4F0"/>JUSTICE is no diſorderly Appetite, that aims principally at the Ruin of the Guilty, and is diſſatisfied without it. No, it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves Right with pure Affections, and is therefore content when the Injury is repaired, from whomſoever Satisfaction comes.</p>
            <p>THO' an Inocent Perſon cannot ſuffer as Inocent, without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice; yet he may contract an Obligation which will expoſe him to deſerved Sufferings. The Wiſdom and Juſtice of all Nations agree in puniſhing one for anothers Fault, where there is previous Conſent, as in the Caſe of Hoſtages; tho' it is eſſential to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to be inflicted for Sin, yet not on the Perſon ſinning, for in the Judgment of the Law, the Sinner and Surety are one.</p>
            <p>EXCHANGE in Criminal Caſes it is true is not allowed, but that is not from a Suppoſition of Injuſtice in its Nature, for then it would not be allowed in civil; but for other Reaſons, ſuch as theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe Life is a Depoſitum committed to us, to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved till God or the publick Good calls for it; beſides the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick would ſuffer loſs by the Deſtruction of one of its Members, and perhaps the ſurviving innocent, or guilty Perſon, grow worſe by impunity.</p>
            <p>Moreover we ſhould remember, that there is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſame Perſon, when abſtractly conſidered, and by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and when ſuſtaining the Repreſentation of others, ſince ſuch a one's Inocence, tho' it renders him incapable of ſuffering<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſtrictly ſo called, in the former of theſe reſpects, yet not in the latter, becauſe the Law then no longer looks upon his private but publick Character; and conſequently the Puniſhment of thoſe he repreſents devolves upon their Proxy. Theſe Things duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, the aforeſaid grand and popular Objection vaniſhes into Smoke.</p>
            <p>But it is again objected, that the Puniſhment which our SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR underwent, was not the ſame which the Law threatned, and therefore is not Satisfactory; it is but the Death of one, but a tranſient and temporal Death, whereas the eternal Death of all was threatned.</p>
            <p>I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> It is true there was a Difference in ſome Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, but not in Subſtance. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> did endure a real tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Death, and ſomething Equivalent to an eternal, in weight and value. He could not endure indeed the reproaches of a ſinful Mind, or the Anguiſh of Deſpair, becauſe it is impoſſible from the Nature of Things, that theſe Calamities could come upon an ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and divine Perſon, they being the reſult of perſonal Guilt and Impotency to atone for it; but our Lord endured Agonies of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Kind, the awful apprehenſions of a painful ignominious Death, the Malice of <hi>Satan,</hi> and the unrelenting Vengeance of Almighty God, which all united at once againſt him; while in the mean Time the divine Nature, as it were, withdrew from his relief. Whatever were the Ingredients of that <hi>bitter Cup</hi> which God that mix'd them, and he that drunk them, only knew, yet this we may ſay, that it could be no ordinary <hi>penal</hi> preſſure,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:006426_0022_1028E4CFF11AADC0"/>
which could overwhelm his Soul with ſuch a deluge of Grief, diſſolve his Body into a ſweat of Blood, and at laſt extort this awful outcry, <hi>My God, My God, why haſt thou forſaken me.</hi> This inexpreſſible weight of Pain, which the dignity of his Perſon put an immenſe Value upon, made his Sufferings equal to the Guilt of all he repreſented, and more than equal to the ſufferings of all Mankind; the eternal anguiſh of the whole human Race could not have ſo much honoured the Juſtice and Law of God, as the Sufferings of God himſelf in our Nature, tho' but for a ſmall ſpace of Time.</p>
            <p>But to open and illuſtrate this Matter more fully, let it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd, that it was impoſſible for the <hi>Redeemer</hi> to pay the Debt of Penalty denounced by the Law for Sin, in all the Circumſtances of it: He did indeed endure a <hi>natural Death</hi> ſtrictly ſo called, but then it was but one in the Room of Millions, the Defficiency of which was made up by the Dignity of his Perſon.</p>
            <p>BUT as to <hi>ſpiritual Death,</hi> tho' he bore ſomething like it, <hi>viz.</hi> the withdrawing for a Time a comfortable Senſe of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers love, and anguiſh of Spirit, in a Degree that we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or expreſs; yet it was impoſſible that he ſhould endure it in all its Parts ſtrictly and properly; for as <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Life includes theſe two Things, <hi>viz,</hi> a Union to God by Faith and pious Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, from which all truly ſpiritual and acceptable Acts proceed, ſo by the Law of Contraries, <hi>ſpiritual Death</hi> muſt needs include a real Separation from God, a real removal or privation of pious Habits, for ſo long as one has them, however clouded, weakned or out of Exerciſe, tho' he may be ſaid to be in a ſpiritual Sleep or Conſumption, yet he is ſtill alive.</p>
            <p>NOW to ſuppoſe that the human <hi>Soul</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was ſeparated from the divine Nature, as it is without Foundation in Scripture, ſo it deſtroys the infinite value of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of it to Juſtice, which depends upon that Union.</p>
            <p>AND to ſuppoſe that the <hi>Soul</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was devoid of pious Principles or Habits, is to make him a SINNER realy and inherently, and thus to diſqualify him entirely from being a <hi>Saviour</hi> of others. The Reaſon is this, the moral Law being ſpiritual, in Regard of its <hi>Author, Nature</hi> and <hi>Deſign,</hi> and Perfect alſo, muſt needs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire Purity in the Temper and Diſpoſition of the Soul, which cannot be without the aforeſaid Habits: Now if CHRIST wanted theſe, he was diſconformed to the Law, and ſo a <hi>Sinner</hi> realy and inherently, for Sin is any want of Conformity to, or Tranſgreſſion of the Law. <note n="*" place="bottom">1 <hi>John</hi> iii. 4. He amartia eſtin, he anomia.</note>
            </p>
            <p>IF ſo, CHRIST would want another MEDIATOR to ſave him, and therefore he was only made Sin by Imputation, being in the mean Time perſonally and inherently holy, harmleſs and undefiled, and knowing no Sin.</p>
            <p>WHAT was defective in the <hi>Sufferings</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s human Nature,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:006426_0023_1028E4D383312F38"/>
in reſpect of the Species or Circumſtances of the Penalty threatned by the Law, was made up by its Union with the divine, and ſo rendered an equivalent to the demerit of Sin.</p>
            <p>AND indeed, in this Conſtitution, the Wiſdom of God appears admirably; for on the Suppoſition that <hi>Chriſt</hi> paid the Debt in Specie in all Circumſtances which the Law required, (were that poſſible) the Bond would be cancelled, and all thoſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented actually freed from the Curſe, at leaſt from the Time of the Payment made by the Surety, which Notion is as dangerous as abſurd.</p>
            <p>BUT an EQUIVALENT puts it into the original <hi>Creditors</hi> Power whether he will accept of it at all, and when, and how to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the Benefits thereof to the Debtors.</p>
            <p>AGREEABLE hereto the bleſſed God has, in unſpeakable Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goodneſs, ſo formed the Plan of the new Covenant, that none ſhall have any actual Title to, or Inveſtiture in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Purchaſe, until they be enabled to repent and believe.</p>
            <p>THIS, rightly underſtood, entirely overſets the dangerous and inconſiſtent Doctrines of the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> preſerves the Harmony of the Scriptures, and makes the Doctrines of Grace and Duties of Religion entirely conſiſtent.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER Objection is this, How could God receive this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, ſince he himſelf was the Party that gave it? Or how could the <hi>Saviour</hi> of Mankind, ſuppoſing him to be God, make Satisfaction to himſelf? The Anſwer is,</p>
            <p>
               <q>THAT the infinite Goodneſs of God in giving a Redeemer, does not diveſt him of the Office of ſupreme Judge, nor hinder him from receiving a <hi>Ranſom</hi> to preſerve the Rights of Juſtice inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. To illuſtrate this Matter, we have an eminent Inſtance, not unlike it, in the Caſe of <hi>Zaleucus,</hi> the Prince of the <hi>Locrians,</hi> who paſſed a Law, that <hi>Adulterers</hi> ſhould looſe both their Eyes; and when his Son was convicted of that Crime, the People, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected him for his excellent Qualities, came and interceeded for him, <hi>Zaleucus,</hi> in a conflict between Zeal for Juſtice and Affection to his Son, took but one Eye from him, and parted with one of his own to ſatisfy the Law, and in this Action both paid and received the Puniſhment: He paid it as a Father, and received it as a Conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator of publick Juſtice. In like Manner when guilty Mankind could not pay the Forfeiture of the Law, God, the Father of Mercies, was pleaſed to give it from the Treaſures of his Love, <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>Blood</hi> of his Son for our Ranſom; which he neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs as the Supreme Judge received from <hi>Chriſt</hi> upon the Croſs, and declared it <hi>to be an Offering of a ſweet ſmelling Savour to him,</hi> or a ſufficient Satisfaction to his Juſtice.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>NOR is it inconſiſtent with Reaſon, that the Son of God, clothed with our Nature, ſhould by Death make Satisfaction to the <hi>Deity,</hi> and therefore to himſelf. In a Difference between two Parties, a Perſon that belongs to one of them, may interpoſe for Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:006426_0024_1028E4D95DC00B08"/>
provided he diveſts his own Intereſt, and leaves it with the Party from whom he comes. For Inſtance, when a Father and Son, both poſſeſſed of Imperial Power, have been offended by rebellious Subjects, it may not be improper for the Son to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe as a <hi>Mediator,</hi> to reſtore them to the favour of their <hi>Prince,</hi> and yet at the ſame Time he reconciles them to himſelf, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures them the Pardon of an Offence whereby his own Majeſty was violated.</q> But the Time requires that I haſten to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement.</p>
            <p>HAS <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> been ſlain as a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Propitiation</hi> for us? Then how vain, how uncomfortable and perilous is the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of thoſe who deny the <hi>Imputation</hi> of his <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; for hereby they endeavour to ſap the Foundations of the Chriſtian's Hope, and ſhut up the Springs of their Joy, hereby they oppoſe the continued Series of Revelation both in the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New-Teſtament:</hi> To <hi>deny</hi> the <hi>Imputation</hi> of his <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> to <hi>Believers,</hi> is the <hi>ſame Thing</hi> in <hi>effect,</hi> as to deny his being <hi>ſacrificed</hi> for them, and equally <hi>unreaſonable,</hi> as has been before repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, and if CHRIST has not died our Faith is vain, we are without Hope, Help, Comfort; but bleſſed be GOD, tho' the Doctrine of CHRIST crucified be to the <hi>Jews a ſtumbling-block, and to the</hi> Greeks <hi>fooliſhneſs, yet to thoſe that believe, it is the Wiſdom of GOD, and the Power of GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HAS <hi>Chriſt</hi> been ſet forth as a Sacrifice of <hi>Propitiation,</hi> then we may hence learn the Sinfulneſs of Sin and ſtrictneſs of divine Juſtice in the Puniſhment of it; its true, the Evil of <hi>Sin</hi> may be in ſome Meaſure diſcerned from its malignant Nature, being an Enmity againſt the bleſſed GOD, a Contrariety to, and diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Reflexion upon all his adorable Attributes, as well as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Contempt of all the ſacred and unalianable Rights of his Government over the <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Moral</hi> World.</p>
            <p>BUT the moſt affecting Demonſtration of its Malignity appears in thoſe Puniſhments which are inflicted for it; the Torments of the <hi>Damned</hi> are, no doubt, equal to the Demerit, and therefore expreſſive of the great <hi>Evil</hi> of it: But they are too little thought upon and realiz'd by ſtupid, indolent Tranſgreſſors, until it be too late to obtain a Deliverance; and temporal Calamities cannot ſufficiently repreſent the infinite <hi>Diſpleaſure</hi> of GOD againſt the obſtinate and ungrateful Contempt of his Goodneſs and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but in the Sacrifice and Sufferings of CHRIST it is expreſſed to the utmoſt in the moſt ſtrong and flaming Colours. Had divine Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice rent the Heavens and appear'd on this Theatre, attended with the moſt terrible Images of Pomp and Majeſty, to puniſh the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts and Inſults caſt upon the Authority of GOD by impenitent Tranſgreſſors, it could not make a deeper and more abiding Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon our Minds, than the due Conſideration of the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of our Lord JESUS: The drowning of the <hi>Old World</hi> by an awful Inundation of Water, and the dreadful Deſtruction of the Cities of the <hi>Plain</hi> by <hi>Showers of Fire,</hi> do not ſet the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:006426_0025_1028E4DD07B9B4F8"/>
Evil of <hi>Sin,</hi> and divine Severity in the Puniſhment of it in ſo ſtrong and ſtriking a Light; if we conſider not only the Depth of his Sufferings but the Dignity of his Perſon, and near Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his eternal Father; he ſuffered not only <hi>Torments</hi> from Men many Ways, but his <hi>Father</hi>'s <hi>Wrath</hi> in a Degree equal to the Deſert of all the <hi>Sins</hi> of thoſe he repreſented; and the Perſon who endured theſe Things was the <hi>Son of GOD by Nature,</hi> and of co-equal Glory and Majeſty with his eternal Father. O how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible is the Juſtice of GOD, that would not ſpare even his own innocent and beloved Son, when he became <hi>Surety</hi> for Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors.</p>
            <p>AND how then ſhall thoſe eſcape the angry Strokes of GOD'S iron Rod, who obſtinately perſiſt in Unbelief and Impenitence, when ſuch a <hi>dearly purchas'd</hi> Salvation is ſet before them, and they repeatedly and earneſtly urged to accept thereof? Can they fortify themſelves againſt Almightineſs, or encounter with divine Vengeance, the Apprehenſions of which made the Soul of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſorrowful, and heavy, <hi>even unto Death?</hi> Can they bear with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience forever, that Indignation which extorted a bloody Shower from <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Body; and the moſt affecting Lamentations from his Soul! <hi>Eli, Eli, lama ſabachthani,</hi> notwithſtanding his perſonal Inocence and the Supports of his Godhead? O Sinners! For GOD'S ſake, realize theſe Things ſpeedily, leaſt ye feel the Weight of God's Vengeance forever.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, methinks what has been ſaid in the doctrinal Part of this Diſcourſe, ſerves to remove the Reproach of CHRIST'S <hi>Croſs;</hi> this was a <hi>Stone</hi> of <hi>Stumbling,</hi> and a <hi>Rock</hi> of <hi>Offence</hi> to the <hi>Jews,</hi> they wanted a pompous <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to deliver them from tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Bondage, and judged it abſurd to expect great Things or eternal Bleſſedneſs from one under Circumſtances of the deepeſt Abaſement, and many of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are of the ſame Stamp, and take Occaſion of Prejudice one Way or other from <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Croſs;</hi> but to ſuch as believe it is exceeding precious; for they clearly apprehend that CHRIST by his Death has ſatisfied Juſtice, made Attonement for <hi>Sin,</hi> and purchaſed ſpiritual and eternal Benefits: The Doctrine of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Sacrifice upon the Croſs, is the very <hi>Foundation</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> upon which its whole Fabrick is firmly built; its the <hi>Center</hi> in which the <hi>Lines</hi> of both <hi>Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> meet and harmonize, the <hi>Soul</hi> that animates the whole Frame, without which it is but a dead Carcaſe; this is the Source of our Righteouſneſs and Peace, our Comfort and Salvation: This opens a Door of <hi>Hope</hi> to diſtreſſed Sinners, and a Fountain of <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Solace,</hi> to all the Saints of GOD that will never, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver run dry. For the Man <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> is to them <hi>a hiding-place from the Wind, a Covert from the Tempeſt, as Rivers of Waters in a dry Place, and as the Shadow of a great Rock in a weary Land,</hi> ſure Protection from every Danger, ſweet Refreſhment in every Difficulty, and ſtrong Support under every Preſſure; a Balm to every Wound, a Salvo to every Fear, yea, even to that
