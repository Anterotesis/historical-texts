            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THE following <hi>Sermons,</hi> plain and ſimple as they are, for <hi>Mourning</hi> forbids Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament, had been publiſh'd <hi>ſooner,</hi> if at all, after the <hi>Funeral</hi> of my dear Child, if the putting in Order ſome <hi>Memoirs</hi> of her ſhort <hi>Exemplary Life</hi> had not obliged us to ſome <hi>Delay.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I hope both the <hi>Sermons</hi> and the <hi>Memoirs</hi> may be of good Uſe to <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>Children,</hi> and to <hi>Miniſters</hi> and their Children in particular, or I ſhould not trouble the <hi>Public</hi> with them.</p>
                  <p>As the <hi>Father</hi> of the <hi>Deceaſed</hi> I owe this Reſpect unto her Memory, but more as a <hi>Miniſter</hi> I owe it to the Children of my <hi>Country</hi> and of the <hi>Town.</hi> It becomes Me now <hi>in Age</hi> to write for <hi>Thoſe</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Whom I have been miniſtring theſe <hi>five and thirty</hi> Years; and I <hi>magnify my Office</hi> (to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the Words of the Great <hi>Apoſtle) if I may

provoke to Emulation thoſe that are my Fleſh.</hi> I mean, If what is here publiſh'd may ſerve to put <hi>Parents</hi> on more <hi>early</hi> and continued Endeavours for the Souls of their Children, and to inſpire our <hi>Dau'ters</hi> in particular with <hi>Deſires</hi> to improve in Knowlege and Goodneſs under the Inſtructions of their wiſe and gracious Parents. <hi>This,</hi> by the Will of God, ought to be to me <hi>a Joy</hi> next to any <hi>Saving Miniſtrations to my own Offspring,</hi> whereof the following <hi>Record</hi> gives me ſome humble <hi>Hope:</hi> Scil. That it has pleaſed God to make Me, together with my good Son Mr. <hi>Turell,</hi> a <hi>Spiritual Father</hi> to my lov'd Child, and that <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus</hi> we <hi>have begotten her thro' the Goſpel;</hi> (again to uſe the <hi>Apoſtle's</hi> moſt <hi>pleaſant</hi> Words) — At leaſt the <hi>Reader</hi> will charitably judge that I have with ſome Pains and Throws <hi>been travailing in Birth till Chriſt was formed in her.</hi> In which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech <hi>Others</hi> to be <hi>Followers</hi> of me, who yet am not <hi>worthy</hi> to be named among the <hi>Miniſters of Chriſt.</hi>

                  <p>VERY gracious and exemplary was <hi>this Silence of Aaron,</hi> and very awful was the Providence and <hi>Trial</hi> which made it ſo excellent and admirable in him. <hi>He</hi> and his <hi>Sons</hi> having been called of <hi>God</hi> unto the <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> and ſolemnly conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to the ſervice of the <hi>Sanctuary</hi>; upon the firſt Execution of their Office the <hi>Glory of the Lord</hi> appeared unto all the People, and a <hi>Fire</hi> came from before the <hi>Lord</hi> and conſumed the Burnt-Offering upon the <hi>Altar.</hi> This was a moſt open and glorious Teſtimony of the <hi>Lord's</hi> accepting of his Sanctuary and Altar, his Prieſts alſo and the worſhipping People. Well might it fill them all with tranſports of Joy, and make them <hi>ſhout</hi> and <hi>fall on their Faces.</hi> So they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor'd and gave Thanks to the <hi>King Eternal and Inviſible,</hi> who vouchſaf'd thus to manifeſt Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to them, and ſhow 'em His Glory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="unknown:003888_0013_100317FE42A24D18"/>But the Sin and Sudden Death of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> (the two Sons of <hi>Aaron</hi> who had been dignified among <hi>the Elders of Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>by Name</hi> called up into the <hi>Mount,</hi> to <hi>ſee the God of Iſrael, and He laid not his Hand on them</hi>; Exod. xxiv. 1, 11.) gave a dreadful <hi>Damp</hi> to the Joys of that glorious Day.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>young Prieſts,</hi> proud it may be of their <hi>Office,</hi> and half intoxicated with the Joy of the ſacred <hi>Feſtival,</hi> took either of them his <hi>Cenſer,</hi> probably without the Divine Order to burn In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe at that Time; and whereas they ſhould have taken of the Fire that was newly kindled on the Altar <hi>from before the Lord,</hi> they offer'd <hi>ſtrange Fire,</hi> us'd common Fire, <hi>which He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was a great piece of Raſhneſs, Irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Preſumption in them; and being the <hi>firſt</hi> Profanation of <hi>God's</hi> Houſe and Worſhip by the <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> it pleas'd the <hi>Holy and Dreadful Majeſty</hi> to ſtrike 'em dead upon the ſpot. <hi>There went out Fire from the Lord and devoured 'em, and they died before the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was ſuch a kind of Bereavement as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver but once hapned, enough to ſwallow up all Words! and no doubt but <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> and all the worſhipping Aſſembly were ſtruck with Aſtoniſhment at the terrible Execution. But <hi>Moſes</hi> inſpir'd of God, with a Preſence of Mind as ſurpriſing as the preſent Event, immediately ſhewed them that ſo it became the <hi>Holineſs of God</hi> to ſanctify Himſelf on them that came nigh Him, if they did not take care to ſanctify his Name in their Approaches to Him and Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions before him: ver. 3. <hi>Then Moſes ſaid unto
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003888_0014_10031827AE280658"/>
Aaron, This is it that the Lord ſpake, ſaying, I will be ſanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the People I will be glorified: And Aaron held his Peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So <hi>Aaron</hi> hearkned to the Word of God, from the Mouth of his Brother <hi>Moſes,</hi> and was <hi>dumb</hi> becauſe God had done it in his wiſe and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Severity: So he <hi>ſanctified</hi> the Lord, and glorified Him before all the People, in adoring Silence and profound Submiſſion.</p>
                  <p>This was as indeed became the <hi>High Prieſt</hi> of the Lord. What an <hi>Example</hi> did he give to the frighted gazing Congregation! But he did no more than was his Duty, nor all that neither. It was of God's great Grace and Mercy to him that he bare as he did. Let God have all the Glory, and <hi>Aaron</hi> his praiſe alſo; for God put Honour on him, glorified his Grace in him.</p>
                  <p>It is the Duty of all Men, more eſpecially of <hi>Miniſters,</hi> to be Silent under Divine Corrections. <q>Not only to bear, but to <hi>accept</hi> of the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Sin. And the moſt effectual Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for ſilencing and quieting a gracious Heart under Affliction, are thoſe that are fetch'd from God's Glory.</q> The Holy One had ſanctified his own Name, &amp; vindicated the Glory of it: This ſilenc'd <hi>Aaron.</hi> 
                     <q>God was glorified and <hi>Aaron</hi> is ſatisfied.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Doctrines I would briefly ſpeak to are, 1. That there is a gracious <hi>Silence</hi> which may highly become us in our ſorrowful <hi>Bereavements</hi>; more eſpecially when they are <hi>ſudden</hi> &amp; awful, and carry much of God's holy Anger and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure in them. 2. That <hi>Miniſters</hi> eſpecially

                  <p>
                     <hi>Such</hi> was this of <hi>Aaron's</hi> in the Text: To have <hi>two Sons,</hi> juſt conſecrated to the Service of God, ſuddenly ſtruck Dead, as it were by Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and that becauſe the Holy God was not ſerv'd by 'em in that reverend Manner which he requir'd,—What could be more ſurprizing, more awful and expreſſive of Divine Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure?</p>
                  <p>The <hi>firſt Death,</hi> the firſt Bereavement of the <hi>firſt Parents</hi> of Mankind, was a very ſudden and awful Breach upon them! And no doubt but <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> tho't God very angry with them, when they ſaw one Son, and him a godly one, Murder'd by his ungodly Brother; becauſe his Works were righteous and He accepted by God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job's</hi> Bereavement was the moſt ſudden and tragical that we ever read of: His <hi>ten Children</hi> feaſting together, and rejoycing in one anothers Love; and on a ſudden comes a fierce Wind from the Wilderneſs, &amp; blows down the Houſe, and buries 'em all together in a moment of Time; cruſh'd to pieces in the mighty Ruines of ſome princely Fabrick.</p>

                     <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Bereavement in the Sudden Death of <hi>Rachel</hi> was very awful to him; as indeed all Deaths in <hi>Child-birth</hi> are, becauſe of the joyful

Hope therein fruſtrated of a new &amp; double Life.

                  </p>
                  <p>The fair <hi>Naomi</hi> had a very awful ſenſe of the Divine Anger, when ſhe return'd from the Land of <hi>Moab</hi> deſolate and empty; having buried <hi>her two Sons and her Husband</hi>: Ruth i. 20. <hi>Call me not Naomi, call me Mara, for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me, and teſtified againſt me.</hi>

Our Affections are irregular, our Paſſions unruly; apt to break out at our Lips, when our Hearts are hot within us. We no ſooner take fire within, but we blow up and burſt to pieces. Out of the Abundance of the Affections the Mouth ſpeaks; but Silence keeps them down from making Work for Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.

That <hi>wiſe and gracious Speaking,</hi> to God and of Him, in the Day of our Affliction, may be ſometimes <hi>better than Silence</hi>; more to the Glory of God, the Edification of Men, and our own Eaſe and Comfort.

                  <p>The <hi>Tongue</hi> was made to ſpeak, as well in the Day of Grief as in the Day of Gladneſs; and in both to the Glory of God. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to the Honour of God, while <hi>Aaron</hi> ſtood ſilent. <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Silence kept Time and Concert with <hi>Moſes</hi> Words.

                     <hi>Aaron</hi> was both a Prophet and a Prieſt, the Mouth of <hi>God</hi> to <hi>Iſrael</hi> and their Mouth to <hi>God</hi>; and he could <hi>ſpeak well,</hi> yet was now Silent. He was now <hi>in Waiting,</hi> miniſtring in his Place, in the Sanctuary, when he gave this Illuſtrious Example of profound Submiſſion: And ſo he ſtands a teaching and commanding Pattern to <hi>the Miniſters of God</hi> for ever, and to them eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially. Every worſhipping <hi>Iſraelite</hi> were to learn of him that awful Day, but the <hi>Prieſthood</hi> and <hi>Levites,</hi> his own <hi>Family</hi> and <hi>Tribe,</hi> more than others.</p>
                  <p>I ſpeak therefore more eſpecially to <hi>my ſelf,</hi> and to my <hi>dear Son,</hi> your honoured and beloved <hi>Paſtor,</hi> this Day; to charge <hi>my ſelf</hi> and <hi>him,</hi> in the Name and Preſence of the <hi>Great and Holy God,</hi> who is pleas'd to lay his bereaving Hand upon <hi>us</hi>; that we fall down before Him and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore his Grace to help us <hi>to carry Our ſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore You</hi> with that Silence and Humiliation that ſhall honour his Holy Name before You, and exemplify in ſome manner <hi>thoſe Doctrines and Commandments of God our Saviour,</hi> which we have been ſo often preaching to you in <hi>the Days of Death and Mourning</hi> that have paſſed over us.</p>

                  <p>THEY are <hi>David</hi>'s calm and quieting Words upon the <hi>Death</hi> of his Child. He had been in great <hi>Sorrows,</hi> the Sorrows of Nature and alſo of Grace; the Sorrows of deep Humiliation and Repentance under the holy Anger and Hand of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet was ſent by God to him to lay open before him his <hi>Sin,</hi> and to tell him that the <hi>Child</hi> ſhould die. <hi>David</hi> humbled his Soul with Faſting, and lay all Night upon the Earth. The <hi>Elders</hi> of his Houſe went to him to raiſe him up and conſtrain him to eat, but he would not be entreated by them. Therefore when the Child was <hi>dead</hi> they were afraid to let him know of it, leſt his Sorrow (which was ſo great before) ſhould quite overwhelm him. But to their Surprize he aroſe and waſhed himſelf, and went into the Houſe of God &amp; worſhipped;
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:003888_0035_1003056B1C0825C0"/>
and they ſet Bread before him and he did eat. His Servants humbly ask him the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of this his Conduct, and in the Meekneſs of Wiſdom and Grace he <hi>anſwered</hi> &amp; ſatisfied 'em. <q>While the Child was yet alive, ſaid he, I faſted and wept; for I ſaid, Who can tell whether God will be gracious to me, that the Child may live?

                  <p>He could not think of a <hi>Reſurrection</hi> from the State of the Dead, his Prayers and Tears could not bring him back again; he could not expect or deſire it.

                  <p>
                     <hi>So Man lieth down and riſeth not again till the Heavens be no more,</hi> Job xiv. 12. And then the dead ſhall riſe only to be <hi>judged,</hi> every one <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what</hi> he has been and done here <hi>in the Body, whether good or evil,</hi> 2 Cor. v. 10. How far is this from any Return to this animal and ſenſitive Life, to our preſent earthly Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or worldly Poſſeſſions, or to any ſecond Time of Probation, or further Opportunity for ſerving God and our Generation, and working out our own Salvation: the only worthy End and Work of our preſent Time and Life.</p>
                  <p>Upon all, An <hi>Exiſtence</hi> ſomewhere, after we go hence, is ſuppoſed. <hi>Going</hi> and <hi>returning</hi> plainly imply this. We could not be ſaid to <hi>go,</hi>

if our Spirits were not in ſome Place or other after this Life is ended; and much leſs could we ſpeak properly of <hi>not returning,</hi> if we did not indeed exiſt any where.</p>
                  <p>Yet neither can it be inferred from ſuch a <hi>mode</hi> of Speech, that the <hi>Body</hi> ſhall <hi>never</hi> return to Life again, or that the <hi>Soul</hi> ſhall <hi>never</hi> return into the Body: It only means that the depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Spirit</hi> returns not hither, that we know of, till the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of the Dead at the laſt Day. 'Till that Day the Body will not return from the Grave, nor the Spirit from <hi>Hades,</hi> the inviſible World: But then there will be a <hi>Re-union</hi> of Soul and Body.— This was an Article of Faith before <hi>Job</hi>'s Time, and has continued to be ſo down to our Days: Job xix. 25. <hi>For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that He ſhall ſtand at the latter Day upon the Earth; and tho' after my Skin worms deſtroy this Body, yet in my Fleſh ſhall I ſee God: Whom I ſhall ſee for my Self and my Eyes ſhall behold, and not another: tho' my Reins be conſumed within me.</hi> 1 Cor. xv. 42. <hi>For this Corruptible ſhall put on Incorruption, and this Mortal Immortality.</hi>

                  <p>In ſhort, <hi>Going</hi> and <hi>not returning</hi> in our <hi>Text</hi> means, never to live again <hi>ſuch a Life as this</hi> which we now do in the Body, either on bodily or ſpiritual Accounts: <hi>"He ſhall return no more to his H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And this is at laſt the awful meaning of <hi>going</hi> at Death, to return <hi>no more,</hi> "I muſt enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>a fixt and unchangeable State for Eternity,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to enjoy <hi>another Time of Probation &amp; Trial.</hi> There is <hi>a great Gulf fixed</hi> betwixt this and the next World, as well as between the <hi>two infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtant States</hi> in that to come. Luk. xvi. 26, 27. Neither did miſerable <hi>Dives</hi> ask to come back <hi>himſelf</hi> into this World; he knew it could not be granted.

                  <p>The Sum of all is, Our preſent Life is the <hi>only</hi> Time and State of <hi>Probation</hi> to us; at Death we paſs into the World of Reward or Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is eternal &amp; unchangeable.

                  </p>
                  <p>This World is not our <hi>Home.</hi> We are all leaving it. <hi>Time</hi> is of infinite price to mortal Man, and the ſhorter his Time is, it is of ſo much the more Price. Every <hi>Moment</hi> of it ſhould be carefully <hi>redeemed,</hi> in obſerving the <hi>Seaſons</hi> of

particular Duties; to fill it up with Work and Spirit. Death, the <hi>Period</hi> of this Time, is a very awful and critical Moment. Let us ſee to it, that we all <hi>live</hi> as Thoſe that are going hence, we know not how ſoon, never to return. And let it comfort the <hi>Godly,</hi> that they are going from, never again to return to, this State of Sin and Sorrow.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>II.</hi> As our Dead are gone, no more to return to us, ſo <hi>We are going after them to the Grave,</hi> and to <hi>the World of Spirits,</hi> to the State of everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Happineſs</hi> or everlaſting <hi>Miſery.</hi> This nearly concerns us, and ſhould exceedingly affect us.

                  <p>Within a very, very little Time we ſhall all be gone! gone hence for evermore! every Man Woman and Child! every one in his Time and Order, which God has appointed.

                     <hi>We know that God will bring us to Death, and to the Houſe appointed for all the Living.</hi> We as ſurely know it, as that others are dead and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried before us. <hi>Every Man is drawing after as there are innumerable before him.</hi> We might have gone before many whom we have ſeen buried. We are, it may be, a Wonder to our Selves, that we did not go firſt; How ſoon we ſhall follow is unknown to us. We <hi>know not the Day of our Death; we know neither the Day nor the Hour.</hi> This we know, and ſhould be ſaying to our Selves, the Young as well as the Old, <hi>"I go the Way of all the Earth. It is appointed for all Men once to die. We ſee that wiſe Men die, alſo the Fool and brutiſh Perſon periſh. And what Man is he that liveth and ſhall not ſee Death? Shall he deliver his Soul from the Hand of the Grave?</hi> Or who <hi>can by any Means redeem his Brother, or give to God a Ranſom for him? that he ſhould ſtill live for ever and not ſee Corruption?</hi> Pſal. xlix. 9, 10.</p>
                  <p>The Grave is one of the unſatisfied and inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable things that cries, <hi>Give, give!</hi> and never ſays it has enough. One Generation goes down into it after another, yet is it not full. After the Thouſands that are buried to Day, it craves and has as many more to morrow. And if we wait a little longer it is <hi>our Houſe,</hi> it is <hi>ready for us.</hi> Job xvii. 1.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Souls</hi> are alſo going to the ſame Places of Happineſs or Miſery that thoſe before us are gone to. Souls are not <hi>mixt</hi> in the next World as they are in this: Here the Godly and the wicked dwell in the ſame Houſe, eat at the ſame Table, ſleep in the ſame Bed, worſhip together in one Family &amp; in one Aſſembly. But Death
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:003888_0043_10031819A9CB5740"/>
makes a perfect and total Separation of the one from the other. The <hi>Godly</hi> are gathered to <hi>their</hi> People, as the Soul of <hi>Jacob</hi> to the Spirit of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and as the Soul of <hi>Lazarus</hi> to his Boſom; but the wicked and <hi>ungodly</hi> go to the Generation of <hi>their Fathers,</hi> never to ſee Light. — <hi>David,</hi> in the full Perſuaſion of his Child's Salvation, ſaid, <hi>"I ſhall go to him.</hi> Gracious <hi>Parents</hi> will ſee again their Elect Children in everlaſting Life. And there all pious Relations will meet again with Joy, and embrace for Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more: But others <hi>ſhall ſee Abraham and Iſaac and Jacob, and all the Prophets in the Kingdom of God, and be themſelves ſhut out,</hi> Luk. xiii. 28.</p>
                  <p>Put then the <hi>Queſtion,</hi> every one to himſelf, <hi>"To whom and whither am I going?</hi> Going we all are, and haſting out of Time into an awful Eternity; but to <hi>which State</hi> in the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal World are <hi>we</hi> haſtning? Whither <hi>others</hi> are gone is not ſo much our Buſineſs to enquire, but whither <hi>we</hi> our Selves are going is a moſt important and neceſſary Conſideration: O the <hi>happy few</hi> that are daily thinking of this! and upon good Grounds can ſay to themſelves, as in 2 Cor. v. init. <hi>For we know that if our earthly Houſe of this Tabernacle were diſſolved, we have a Building of God, a Houſe not made with Hands, eternal in the Heavens: For in this we grone ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, deſiring to be clothed upon with our Houſe which is from Heaven.— Now He that hath wro't us for this ſelf-ſame thing is God, who alſo hath given to us the Earneſt of the Spirit, Therefore we are always confident, knowing that while we are at Home in the Body we are abſent from the Lord; (for we walk by Faith and not by Sight) We are
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:003888_0044_100305EA1E812888"/>
confident, I ſay, and willing rather to be abſent from the Body and to be preſent with the Lord. Wherefore we labour that whether preſent or abſent we may be accepted of Him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I come to the <hi>third</hi> Head,</p>

                     <hi>III.</hi> We ſhould ſeriouſly remember and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe things <hi>in the Days of our Bereavement,</hi> in our <hi>Mourning over our Dead.</hi> Then it was that <hi>David</hi> ſaid, "I ſhall go to my Dead, it ſhall not return to me."</p>
                  <p>This is a moving Seaſon, wherein to <hi>muſe</hi> and let <hi>the Fire kindle,</hi> and then <hi>ſpeak</hi> to our Selves and others of our own and their <hi>Dying.</hi> Yea, and to ſpeak to God and ſay, as in the xxxix Pſalm, <hi>Lord! make me to know my End and the Meaſure of my Days, what it is; that I may know how frail I am! Behold thou haſt made my Days a hand-breadth, and my Age is nothing before Thee! Verily every Man at his beſt Eſtate is altogether Vanity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>David</hi> the King, the Prophet and the Saint is a good <hi>Teacher,</hi> a great <hi>Example</hi> to us. Let us learn of Him to turn our <hi>Eyes off</hi> from our Dead, <hi>upon</hi> our Selves; upon our own <hi>Souls,</hi> their State, and Frame; and to ſay, <q>
                        <hi>My Soul,</hi> thou muſt ſoon go after thy Dead! in what Preparation art thou for a better World? in what Readineſs to leave this? and where would be thy Lot if this Night thou were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired hence?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>O that we were wiſe, that we underſtood this, that we were conſidering our latter End! This is God's <hi>Wiſh</hi> concerning us, and we cannot wiſh
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:003888_0045_1003181B2D7826E8"/>
our Selves better than this wiſe and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Heart. Let us ask of God this Wiſdom which we ſo greatly want, and which He is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral to give. Pſal. xc. 12. <hi>So teach us to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber our Days, that we may apply our Hearts unto Wiſdom.</hi> What an eaſy Numeration Table is this! So many of our few Days already paſt; but ſo many more at the utmoſt Bounds to come; and whether indeed one more of them remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us, altogether uncertain.</p>
                  <p>One would think that <hi>Fleſh and Blood</hi> ſhould teach men all this: And if not the Tokens of Death within our Selves, yet the pale and gaſtly Face of it on our neareſt Relations, Friends and Nei'bours. But neither Fleſh and Senſe, nor natural Affection &amp; Sorrow of Heart can make us to know our own End, and the Meaſure of our Days, how frail we are. God only can reach the Hearts of Sinners with an effectual ſaving Impreſſion. Men <hi>ſee</hi> others go, and <hi>feel</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves going, and yet will not conſider it. There is an Enmity and Averſion in mortal Man to the ſober Conſideration of Death, the realizing his own Death, &amp; the Conſequents thereon. Death paſſes by us, and touches us, and we are a little mov'd for the preſent, but preſently forget it again. Sin which has brought Death on us, has taken away the Underſtanding, the Power and Heart to make a juſt and deliberate Reflection on the matter.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Wiſdom</hi> cometh down from <hi>the Father of Light,</hi> and is one of his moſt perfect <hi>Gifts.</hi> We are naturally all Darkneſs &amp; Inſenſibility in our Way to the Grave, as well as when we are in it. We need Divine Teaching in this moſt plain
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:003888_0046_1003183F48142938"/>
and obvious matter, of which we are willingly ignorant. God muſt give us <hi>an Eye to ſee,</hi> and <hi>an Ear to hear,</hi> and <hi>a Heart to underſtand.</hi> The fault does not lie in the <hi>Head,</hi> but in the <hi>Heart.</hi> The Promiſe of God is, <hi>a new Heart will I give you.</hi> He gives it liberally to them that ask it. It is the Spirit &amp; Practice of his Saints to think daily and ſeriouſly of Death and Eternity, and to be often ſaying to Themſelves and before the Lord, <q>
                        <hi>O my Soul, thou</hi> art going after the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations before thee! Is there not an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Time <hi>to me</hi> as well as others? O re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that <hi>my Life</hi> is Wind! thine Eyes are upon me and I <hi>am not!</hi> for now <hi>ſhall I</hi> ſleep in the Duſt, and Thou ſhalt ſeek me in the Morning, and <hi>I ſhall not be!</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>This is proper <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> of a Soul to it <hi>ſelf,</hi> and to God, in this mortal Body, and through this paſſing World. So let it <hi>muſe,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he Heart <hi>grow hot,</hi> and out of the Abundance of it the Tongue <hi>ſpeak, "Lord make me to know my end.</hi> Light &amp; Heat come thus together into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering Heart, and the Sun of Righteouſneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes over it with vital Influences; gives ſpiritual Life and ſuſtains it in this Way. So Bodily Death ſerves to ſpiritual and eternal Life under the Power of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> The Flames of Devotion kindle, are blown up, and kept burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by daily Meditation on Death &amp; Eternity. But as this ceaſes, ſo the other goes out.</p>
                  <p>It is in this Way, very much, that the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> works on Souls, and carries on his good Work in them. He works by Providences and Ordinances together to this End, and on this wiſe. He revives and renews his good Work
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:003888_0047_1003181E5B042EF8"/>
hereby. He ſends <hi>Death</hi> into our Windows, Chambers and Boſoms on this Errand; and he is <hi>the Miniſter of God</hi> to us for Good, a Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger one of a thouſand. <hi>David</hi> in our Text found <hi>Nathan</hi> &amp; Death alike to him in the Hand of God. It was good for him that his <hi>Child</hi> died. (And in all Probability it had been ill for all <hi>Iſrael</hi> had it lived.) Death rung a Peal in his Ears, and he anſwered, <hi>"Lord I am coming!</hi> And as often as any die in our Families, this is the Lord's <hi>Voice</hi> to us, <q>Man, Woman, Child, thou alſo art following! in what Readineſs art thou?</q> Who is the <hi>Man of Wiſdom</hi> that hears and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to this Voice of God? This makes it good to go unto the Houſe of Mourning, there to conſider of the End of all Men, and lay the matter to Heart.</p>
                  <p>This is the Will of God <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning us, for <hi>He</hi> has given us the Example. He kept his own Hour in Mind, and quickned Himſelf, <hi>"I muſt work the Work of Him that ſent Me, while it is Day, the Night cometh.</hi> He retired upon the Death of his Friend the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and he wept and groan'd in Spirit at the Grave of <hi>Lazarus</hi>; for He was preſently to die Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and how was He ſtraitned till it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed?</p>
                  <p>How great then is the Irreligion of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and the Madneſs of mortal Men, in their Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of their own frail and dying State! Eccl. ix. 10. <hi>Man knoweth not his Time; but as the Fiſhes are taken in an evil Net, and as the Birds are caught in the Snare, ſo are the Sons of Men ſnared in an evil Time, when it cometh ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly upon them.</hi> As if we were not made wiſer

than the <hi>Birds,</hi> or were made as ſtupid and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible as the very <hi>Fiſh!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Imprudence and Improvidence of the Children of Men is very provoking to God, and great <hi>Sin</hi> in them; being in Contempt of the <hi>Reaſon</hi> which <hi>God</hi> has given them, of the <hi>Souls</hi> that He has made them, and of his <hi>Word</hi> which He has written for them, and of all that is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſaid to 'em of a future State and of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Judgment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> therefore interprets this ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs fearleſs Life to mean nothing leſs than thoſe Words of profane Licence, which are ſo ſeverely animadverted on &amp; expoſed in Scripture, <hi>"Let us eat and drink for to Morrow we die! And to Morrow ſhall be as this Day and much more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant!

Let Him lead us again and again to the Grave after our Friends, we go home and forget where we have been, what manner of Men, what corruptible Fleſh we are, and that we our ſelves may be next carried out and buried.</p>
                  <p>Let <hi>Relatives</hi> in their Sorrows over their Dead judge themſelves by what has been ſaid, and be thereby directed and quickned.

                  <p>The Death of <hi>Children</hi> is the moſt common Caſe in the whole Courſe of <hi>Death.</hi> Parents often live to bury many Children, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times all. They that live long in this World, as the Excellent <hi>Judge Hale</hi> ſaid on the Death of a Son, muſt look for this Grief. And the Grief is uſually great in this Caſe, for Natural Affection is like Water, flowing downward. The Love of Parents runs down in a Torrent, the Love of Children returns as in an Eddy, which is alſo caus'd by the Stream. When the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> would repreſent the moſt bitter Grief, He repreſents it by a <hi>Mourning for an Only Son, and for a firſt-born.</hi> Zech. xii. 10.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> Mourning was of Parents for their Son. <hi>Abel</hi>'s Death was a bitter Grief to our firſt Parents. It called for Tears of Blood, and was as a Sword in the Bowels of <hi>Eve.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When God would prove <hi>Abraham</hi> it was in this moſt tender point. <hi>"Take now thy Son, thy only one, whom thou loveſt, and offer him to me.</hi> The God of <hi>Abraham</hi> knew what of all earthly

                  <p>
                     <hi>Jacob</hi> was able to ſee his beloved <hi>Rachel</hi> die, and when he had ſet a <hi>Pillar</hi> on her Grave <hi>he journeyed on.</hi> Gen. xxxv. 20, 21. <note n="‡" place="bottom">

Nor is there any part of ſacred Story that delineates theſe, like that of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Joſeph,</hi> inimitably tender and mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. How is the Heart of a <hi>Father</hi> here painted beyond the Life, to a humane Eye, pierced, bleeding burſting, on ſuppoſed repeated Bereavements, in the Loſs of <hi>three Sons</hi>? Geneſis xlii. 36, 37, 38. <hi>And Jacob their Father ſaid to them, Me have ye bereaved of my Children; Joſeph is not, and Simeon is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And Reuben ſpake unto his Father ſaying, ſtay my two Sons if I bring him not to thee; deliver him into my Hand, and I will bring him to thee again. And he ſaid, My Son ſhall not go down with you, for his Brother is dead, and he is left alone; if Miſchief befal him by the Way in which ye go, then ſhall ye bring down my gray Hairs with Sorrow to the Grave.</hi> Chap. xliii. 6, 11, 13. <hi>And Iſrael ſaid, Wherefore dealt ye ſo ill with me, as to tell the Man whether ye had yet a Brother</hi>?— But <hi>if it muſt be ſo now,— Take your Brother and ariſe, go again to the Man; and God Almighty give you Mercy before him, that he may ſend away your other Brother and Benjamin! If I am bereaved of my Children, I am bereaved.</hi> — What a <hi>giving up</hi> of Nature was here! like his after <hi>gathering up his feet</hi> into the bed! So the dying Body af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a vain Struggle reſigns, and gives up the <hi>Ghoſt.</hi> And if hid God had that Day required the <hi>Patriarch's</hi> Spirit and his Breath, the Summons had been much more readily o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, than this Surrender of his <hi>Benjamin</hi> to the Will of the <hi>Man</hi> who had ſo ſtrangely demanded a Sight of Him. But he had <hi>Simeon</hi> in Bonds, and the <hi>Life</hi> of all the reſt of his Sons and their Children depended on his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; the <hi>Famine was ſore upon</hi> them all, and this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained him to let the other and only remaining Part of his <hi>Rachel</hi> go.</p>
                        <p>No doubt but it was a <hi>Spectacle</hi> highly pleaſing to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> as it is unto <hi>Men</hi> for evermore; but how much more unto the <hi>Father Almighty</hi> Himſelf, to behold the <hi>dear Parent</hi> in his feeble Age wreſtling and agoniſhing in Prayer for Divine Direction, and then in Faith committing his <hi>Only One</hi> to the tender Care and ſtrong Protection of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe and Sovereign Providence, even as <hi>Abraham</hi> had done <hi>Iſaac</hi> long before.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Judah</hi> had with the utmoſt Emotion of Soul obſerved all theſe things, and laid 'em up in his Heart; and as he had in a <hi>Strain</hi> of filial Tenderneſs which merited the Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and carried it from <hi>Reuben,</hi> pleaded with his <hi>Father</hi> and prevailed: So when he ſtood again before <hi>the Man</hi> and ſaw <hi>Benjamin</hi> arreſted by his Order and in Cuſtody, he was able to ſet <hi>the Soul of his Father</hi> in ſuch a Light before <hi>Joſeph,</hi> as overwhelmed his Conſtancy, and broke up all the <hi>Springs of Nature,</hi> which he had <hi>damm'd</hi> up with the greateſt Art and Reſolution, as <hi>Bars and Doors to the great Deep.</hi> See Gen. xliv. 18,—34.</p>
                        <p>Forgive a <hi>Father</hi> in the Depth of Sorrow, that he has tried <hi>to ſoothe his Grief</hi> in this Excurſion on the <hi>Parental Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs</hi> of <hi>Jacob</hi> in the Day of his Bereavements.</p>

Chap. xxxvii 33, 34, 35. <hi>It is my Son's Coat; an evil Beaſt hath devoured him; Joſeph is without doubt rent in Pieces!

                  <p>In like manner the mighty Reverence and Strength of <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Grace was tried, as with <hi>Fire,</hi> in the Sight of all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>he held his Peace.</hi> His profound <hi>Silence</hi> ſpake aloud his profound <hi>Grief.— Job</hi> had been long before tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in more awful manner than this of <hi>Aaron</hi>; and he ſtands a prior Inſtance of <hi>Parental</hi> Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs &amp; Conſtancy.

                  <p>My <hi>Text</hi> relates how <hi>David</hi> behav'd on the Death of his <hi>Child,</hi> but on <hi>more bitter</hi> Occaſions of Grief he <hi>loſt</hi> himſelf, when he ſhould rather have kept the Poſſeſſion of his Soul, and call'd in the Exerciſe of Reaſon and Grace: I mean more eſpecially on the Death of <hi>Abſalom</hi>; unto Whom he could not wiſh to have his Soul ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered; tho' he wiſhed to have died for him, if he might have lived to repent.</p>
                  <p>The Love of <hi>Mothers</hi> is yet more tender. We read of <hi>two</hi> under a like Bereavement, but not in a like Paſſion of Grief; the Widow of <hi>Zidon</hi> and the <hi>Shunamite</hi>: When the one ſaw her <hi>Son</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Parent</hi> we ſhould think will improve the Grief, behave and ſpeak aright under it; ſpeak unto <hi>God,</hi> to himſelf and his. He has Years, Experience and Wiſdom; is a <hi>Father</hi> and has ſeen much of a dying World: And what is the Father's <hi>Leſſon</hi> from his Child's Death, but <hi>this</hi> in my Text?

                     <hi>Firſt</hi> then, Let <hi>Parents prepare to part</hi> with their Children. Look on them as <hi>dying</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and accordingly care for their <hi>Souls.</hi> Look not upon them as <hi>yours,</hi> but God's, who may call for them when he will, having only given them to you in Truſt and Charge, to educate them for him, for his Service here, and for Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs in Himſelf for ever. Teach 'em betimes to know God and themſelves; that they have precious immortal Souls, and that God is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Lord and Judge of their Spirits; that they are made for another and far better Life, may very ſoon die, and muſt whenever God orders, who will ſurely bring them into Judgment.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

die in the Preſence of their Father; And <hi>Nao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi</hi> buried her two Sons in the Land of <hi>Moab.</hi> Indeed Parents naturally <hi>deſire</hi> that their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may out-live them; and good Parents may let their Children hear 'em <hi>ask</hi> it of God in their daily Family Prayers; that theirs (by his holy Will) may live to ſerve Him when they are gone. With Reverence &amp; great Submiſſion Children may ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to ſuch Prayers of their Parents; but they may not pleaſe themſelves with the Expectation of ſurviving their loving and dear Parents; to come into their Eſtate, nor for any worſe Ends. We read of One who wickedly expected to out-live his Father and ſaid, <hi>The Days of Mourning for my Father are at Hand, and then I will kill my Brother.</hi> But pious Children, from the Day of <hi>Abel</hi>'s Death, think of dying before their Parents.</p>

Thus did <hi>David</hi> in the Text. He had done well to have had his own Death as much in Mind, and in a like manner, when he heard of <hi>Abſalom</hi>'s; tho' indeed he could not without <hi>horror</hi> have tho't of <hi>going to him.</hi> Happy the Father and Mother, the Son or Daughter, that can look forward <hi>to their own Death,</hi> and quiet themſelves in the Day of their Bereave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. O what need is there to be in a State of <hi>Grace and Peace with God</hi> for this End! and to have a well grounded Hope of ſuch a State! of an Intereſt in Chriſt and a better Life.— A Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſhould look on himſelf as ſo much <hi>nearer</hi> to Death than his Child, and ſhould be able to hope, thro' Grace, that he is ſo much higher to a <hi>better</hi> Life, that he ſhould <hi>feel</hi> the ſtrong At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction and <hi>Powers of the World to come.</hi>— As the moſt pious and venerable Mr. <hi>Richard Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> after his Advance in Life and Grace, and a ſufficient Experience of the Vanity &amp; Emptineſs, the Afflictions and Sorrows of this World, wrote under his <hi>Picture</hi> two of the <hi>beſt</hi> Lines that were ever written,

                  <p>You will give me leave therefore openly to utter my great Thankfulneſs to God, that He has pleas'd to Honour me before You in being the Father of ſuch a Child; and if I have any <hi>Hope</hi> of the Grace of God in my own Soul, I

muſt have a Meaſure of holy <hi>Joy</hi> in the Hope of <hi>going</hi> to her at my Deceaſe, which can't be far off, and of <hi>coming</hi> with her in the Day of the Reſurrection of the Juſt.</p>
                  <p>[The Sovereign <hi>God of our Spirits</hi> made her a pleaſant <hi>Soul</hi> to her Parents from her <hi>Infancy. Thrice</hi> ſhe received the Sentence of Death before ſhe was <hi>Eighteen Months</hi> old, and it was a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly Time with us by reaſon of her great Weakneſs, and the mortal Symptoms returning on her. It kept us the more in conſtant &amp; fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent <hi>Supplications</hi> for her Life, and in daily <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignations</hi> of it; and her ſecond and third Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries were as ſurpriſing to her <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> and unto others who ſaw her in her low Eſtate, as unto her near Relations. I have the <hi>Sermons</hi> of Wonder and Gratitude to God, yet lying by me which I preached on thoſe Occaſions, when all Hopes of Life had been once and again taken away. And I can never forget the dark &amp; fair Day, when the <hi>Beloved Phyſician</hi> having warn'd me that nothing now remained but to make the laſt Reſignation of her into the Hands of her <hi>Saviour,</hi> I called my Family together for that End, and did it in the moſt ſolemn manner I was able, wherein I found my ſelf greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, begging of God an <hi>eaſy Death</hi> by his holy Will: when on a ſudden the Babes piercing <hi>ſhrieks</hi> ceas'd, for ſhe lay in great Anguiſhes of pain, and <hi>the ſleep of Death</hi> as we tho't came on and filled us with Tears of Joy to ſee her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring in Eaſe: but to our great Surprize we found it the next Morning to be the <hi>ſleep of Life,</hi> for ſhe wak'd free from every Sign of Danger,

her great Weakneſs excepted: She half opened one of her ſunk Eyes, and anſwered unto the <hi>Barrow</hi> in the Street, repeating what was cry'd there to be Sold. When the dear and Reverend Mr. <hi>Pemberton</hi> ſaw this ſtrange Recovery, and had expreſs'd a kind of Aſtoniſhment at it, he turn'd to me and ſaid, <q>Well Mr. <hi>Colman,</hi> I am perſwaded God purpoſes to make this <hi>Child</hi> a Bleſſing and remarkable in her Life.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the midſt of this <hi>Bodily Weakneſs</hi> her <hi>Soul</hi> made uncommon Improvements for an Infant State; and it may be much <hi>the more</hi> for the weak State of the Body; for ſhe had not Strength to run about and play like other Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which was then our Grief. We made it therefore our daily Pleaſure, and her Diverſion, to learn her <hi>Letters,</hi> and <hi>Prayers</hi> to God her Maker, Redeemer and Sanctifier, and to fill her little Mind with the Stories of all the <hi>Holy Men</hi> on Sacred Record; to ſtrike her Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Affection with true <hi>Excellency</hi> and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; for which End I took care to ſpeak to her of every thing in a juſt and <hi>proper</hi> Manner, if poſſible to convey <hi>regular</hi> Ideas into her, as of the Greatneſs and Goodneſs of God, ſo of all that relates to his <hi>Worſhip</hi> and Service. By this Means before ſhe could go alone ſhe had ſuck'd in a <hi>little Treaſure</hi> of Sacred Knowlege, and was nouriſhed up from the Breaſt with the <hi>ſincere Milk of the Word</hi>; the Knowlege whereof became the humble <hi>Pride</hi> of her Childhood, for we taught her to <hi>value</hi> her ſelf on it, as far better than bodily Ornaments.]</p>

                     <pb n="51" facs="unknown:003888_0062_1003185AF332E348"/>I early obſerv'd her daily Retirements <hi>to pray to her Father in Heaven,</hi> at five or ſix year old, or before; and tho't it my Duty to <hi>praiſe</hi> her for it, and examine her <hi>how</hi> and for <hi>what</hi> ſhe prayed? and whether ſhe kept to Mr. <hi>Henry</hi>'s excellent <hi>Form</hi> for Children? but her <hi>Anſwer</hi> greatly pleas'd as well as ſurpris'd me, "that ſhe found God gave her Words to ſpeak when ſhe began to pray.

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spirit of God</hi> was moving upon her often in her following Youth.

                  <p>Her Heart was always <hi>above the Things of this World</hi>; ſo far as I could perceive from firſt to laſt; and neither the <hi>Proſpects</hi> of it elevated her, nor <hi>Injuries</hi> from it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>She early gave her Self up to God, but her <hi>timorous</hi> Diſpoſition reſtrain'd her from proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing early to the <hi>Lord's Table</hi>; nor was it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much Conflict of Soul and great Diſtreſs, thro' Fear of coming unworthily, that ſhe at laſt came into full Communion.

                  <p>Her <hi>Siſter</hi>'s Soul was, next to her own, her chief Care, and ſhe even <hi>travail'd in Birth</hi> for her, to ſee <hi>Chriſt formed in her:</hi> She wrote to her, and ſpake to her for this End, living and dying, with the greateſt Concern and Endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

charm'd and reproved by her Example, that pleaſant Day! But yet more ſo <hi>Eleven</hi> Days after, when God called for the Babe away, to ſee her <hi>reſign</hi> him with a Silence and Calmneſs, like that of the <hi>Shunamite</hi> of old, and almoſt without a <hi>Tear</hi>; for ſhe had <hi>ſurrender'd</hi> and offer'd him up on the Day he was <hi>baptized.</hi>

                  <p>[Her dear <hi>Couſins</hi> tell me that when they ſometimes <hi>viſited</hi> her, and made ſome abode with her, ſhe would in the <hi>Afternoons</hi> ſlip away from them, and at an hours End return with a Smile and tell 'em how pleas'd ſhe had been to hear 'em ſo merry.

                  <p>But after all it muſt be ſaid, That her Temper was exceeding <hi>timorous,</hi> and her Diſtemper <hi>Hyſteric,</hi> the Accidents of which all know to be a <hi>Swimming</hi> of the Head and <hi>Inquietude</hi> of Mind.

one. Her Conſtitution from her early Infancy was wonderful weak and tender, yet the Organs of her Body ſo form'd as not to obſtruct the free Operations of the active and capacious Spirit within. The Buddings of Reaſon and Religion appear'd on her ſooner than uſual. — Before her <hi>ſecond</hi> Year was compleated ſhe could ſpeak diſtinctly, knew her Letters, and could relate many Stories out of the Scriptures to the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and Pleaſure of the moſt Judicious. I have heard that Governour <hi>Dudley,</hi> with other Wiſe and Polite <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> have plac'd her on a Table and ſetting round it own'd themſelves diverted with her Stories. — Before ſhe was <hi>four</hi> Years old (ſo ſtrong and tenacious was her Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory) ſhe could ſay the greater Part of the <hi>Aſſembly's Catechiſm,</hi> many of the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> ſome hundred Lines of the beſt <hi>Poetry,</hi> read diſtinctly, and make pertinent Remarks on many things ſhe read.—</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Even at the Age of <hi>four, five,</hi> &amp; <hi>ſix</hi> ſhe ask'd many aſtoniſhing <hi>Queſtions</hi> about divine Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and carefully laid up and hid the <hi>Anſwers</hi> ſhe received to them, in her Heart.</p>

                     <pb n="62" facs="unknown:003888_0072_10030633896B6C38"/>Throughout her Childhood ſhe diſcover'd a very <hi>ſerious</hi> Spirit. Her Heart was tender, and her Conſcience a well-inform'd faithful Guide, and Monitor.</p>
                  <p>The moſt that I am able to collect of her Life from <hi>ſix</hi> to <hi>ten</hi> is general (and from her) viz. That her <hi>Father</hi> daily inſtructed her, and inrich'd her Mind with the beſt Knowlege; and excited her to the due Performance of all Duty. And that her tender gracious <hi>Mother</hi> (who dy'd about four years before her) often pray'd for, and over her, and gave her the wiſeſt Counſels, and moſt faithful Warnings; and that ſhe was thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and grew in Knowlege and (ſhe hoped) in Grace under them.— That ſhe lov'd the <hi>School</hi> and the Exerciſes of it, and made a laudable Progreſs in the various Kinds of Learning proper to her Age and Sex.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>nine</hi> or <hi>ten</hi> (if not before) ſhe was able to write; for in the Year 1718, I find a Letter of her honour'd Father's to her wrote in Anſwer to one of her's, Dated <hi>Brookline</hi>—Which he expreſſes himſelf well pleaſed with. A Copy of it follows.</p>

                  <p>Theſe Condeſcentions of her <hi>Father</hi> were no doubt of great Uſe to her, and had in ſome meaſure the Effect propos'd, to put her on think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and writing more and better, and to gain more of his Eſteem for Ingenuity and Piety, which ſhe was wiſely ambitious of; but above all to approve her Heart before God, <hi>her Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father who ſees in ſecret.</hi>

                              <l>AS on the Margin of Euphrates Flood</l>
                              <l>We wail'd our Sins, and mourn'd an angry GOD;</l>

                              <l>And by a righteous Judge condemn'd we ſtand;</l>
                              <l>Deep were our Groans, our Griefs without compare,</l>

                        <p>YOur's of the fifth Inſtant was exceeding pleaſant to me, both your Paraphraſe on the 137 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Letter</hi> that inclos'd it. In the Letter you wiſh you might inherit ſomething of your Father's Soul and therein his Gifts. If that be worthy of your Deſire God has in a great Meaſure given it to you; only you muſt go on by Reading and Study to improve the Powers which God has given you. My poor Gift is in thinking and writing with a little Eloquence, and a poetical turn of Thought. This, in proportion to the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages you have had, under the neceſſary and uſeful Reſtraints of your Sex, you enjoy to the full of what I have done before you. With the Advantages of my liberal Education at School &amp; College, I have no reaſon to think but that your Genius in Writing would have excell'd mine. But there is no great Progreſs or Improvement ever made in any thing but by Uſe and Induſtry and Time. If you dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently improve your ſtated and ſome vacant Hours every Day or Week to read your <hi>Bible,</hi> and other uſeful Books, you will inſenſibly

grow in Knowlege and Wiſdom, fine Tho'ts and good Judgment, from Year to Year, to the Pleaſure of your Friends, the Profit of your Children, if God give you any, and to your own ſpiritual and everlaſting Advantage; if you direct all unto, and govern it by the Glory of God. But as to a Poetical Flight now and then, let it be with you only a thing by the by. At your leiſure and ſpare Hours you may indulge your Inclinations this way. But let them not break in either upon the daily Hours of ſecret Reading or Devotion. — So you ſhall conſecrate your Heart &amp; Life, your Muſe and your daily Works, to the Honour of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Way of your own Salvation.</p>
                        <p>You ask me to forgive the flow of your Affections, which run with ſo ſwift a Current of filial Duty as may carry you beyond your ſelf ſometimes, and make you wanting in that Reſpect which you aim at expreſſing". It is true, my <hi>Dear,</hi> that a young fond and muſical Genius is eaſily carry'd away thus; and never more than when it runs into the Praiſes of what it loves; and I would have you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore careful againſt this Error, even when you ſay your Tho'ts of Reverence and Eſteem to your <hi>Father,</hi> or to a <hi>Spouſe</hi> if ever you ſhould live to have one. It is eaſy to be laviſh and run into fooliſh Flatteries. I think you have done well to correct your Self for ſome of your Excurſions of this kind toward me. Your <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> is pleas'd with your love; and <hi>you</hi> are but a poor partial Judge of his Gifts or Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.—But if you ſee any thing of Chriſt in any, and whatever things are <hi>juſt,</hi> whatever
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:003888_0081_1003187AE789E708"/>
things are <hi>lovely,</hi> think of theſe things and i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate them.</p>
                        <p>You deſire me to correct the faults in your Verſes. I have always done that freely, both as to your Proſe and Verſe. Nor be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd hereby, but inſtructed. It is your learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time, and I am not aſham'd of my <hi>Pupil.</hi>— But you have taken the laſt Paper of Verſes with you, which prevents my ſending you any Emendations of them. Commendation of them in the general I do however ſend. The ſerious melancholy <hi>Pſalm</hi> is well turn'd in the moſt parts of it, conſidering your Years and Advantages for ſuch a Performance. You ſpeak of a ſingle <hi>wither'd Willow</hi> which they hung their Harps on; but <hi>Euphrates</hi> was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with Willows along the Banks of it, ſo that it has been call'd <hi>the River of Willows.</hi> I hope, my Dear, your Lyre will not be hung on ſuch a ſorrowful <hi>Shrub.</hi> Go on in ſacred Songs, and we'll hang it on the ſtately <hi>Cedars of Lebanon.</hi> Or let the pleaſant <hi>Elm</hi> before the Door where you are ſuffice for you. — Give my love to Mr. P— and Madam, who receive you with ſuch Courteſie and Love. We wiſh their pleaſant Air and Converſation may ſerve your Health both of Body and Mind; and that your Company may be of ſome Pleaſure and Uſe to them.</p>

of <hi>Nature, Providence</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> which ſhe ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifies and enumerates in the following manner,</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) I thank God for my Immortal <hi>Soul,</hi> and that <hi>Reaſon</hi> &amp; Underſtanding which diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes me from the lower Creation.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) For my Birth in a <hi>Chriſtian Country,</hi> in a Land of Light, where the true God and Jeſus Chriſt are known.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3) For pious and honourable <hi>Parents,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I am favour'd beyond many others.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>She writes of the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God in making Man a <hi>Sociable</hi> Creature; of the Inſtitution of Marriage in the paradiſaical State, and the Happineſs of the <hi>firſt Couple</hi>; and what alone will render Perſons <hi>happy</hi> in our fallen State; namely, a faithful Diſcharge of all the <hi>Duties</hi> of that Relation; and then particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the Duties, and treats of the Miſchiefs that follow upon the Neglect of them; Shews at large what their Duty is who are about to enter into that State, namely, to ſeek to God by hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Prayer for his Direction and Conduct, and that he would over-rule all the Circumſtances
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:003888_0087_100318854A106A80"/>
of that momentous Affair in Mercy, on which ſo much of the Comfort and Pleaſure of Life depends.—She carries her Tho'ts to the Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Temptations of that Condition, and Prays for ſufficient Grace to carry aright un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all. And for her Aſſiſtance in making a right Choice ſhe laid down a Number of <hi>Rules,</hi> from which ſhe reſolves never to ſtart: Some of them are the following,</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) I would admit the Addreſſes of no Perſon who is not deſcended of pious and credible Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) Who has not the Character of a ſtrict <hi>Moraliſt,</hi> ſober, temperate, juſt and honeſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3) <hi>Diligent</hi> in his Buſineſs, and <hi>prudent</hi> in Matters.</p>
                  <p n="4">(4) <hi>Fixt in his Religion,</hi> a conſtant Attender on the publick Worſhip, and who appears not in God's Houſe with the Gravity becoming a Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p n="5">(5) Of a ſweet and agreable <hi>Temper</hi>; for if he be Owner of all the former good Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and fails here, my Life will be ſtill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Many Letters to her <hi>honoured Father</hi> on various Occaſions.</p>

                  <p>Before She had ſeen <hi>Eighteen,</hi> ſhe had read, and (in ſome meaſure) digeſted all the Engliſh <hi>Poetry,</hi> and polite Pieces in <hi>Proſe,</hi> printed and Manuſcripts in her Father's well furniſh'd Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary, and much ſhe borrow'd of her Friends and Acquaintance. She had indeed ſuch a Thirſt after knowlege that the Leiſure of the Day did not ſuffice, but ſhe ſpent whole Nights in reading.</p>
                  <p>I find ſhe was ſometimes fir'd with a laudable Ambition of raiſing the honour of her <hi>Sex,</hi> who are therefore under Obligations to her; and all will be ready to own ſhe had a fine <hi>Genius,</hi> and is to be placed among thoſe who have excell'd.</p>

                     <pb n="79" facs="unknown:003888_0089_1003065F403B8260"/>When I was firſt indin'd (by the Motions of God's Providence and Spirit) to ſeek her Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance (which was about the Time ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred her <hi>nineteenth</hi> Year) I was ſurpriz'd and charm'd to find her ſo accompliſh'd. I found her in a good meaſure Miſtreſs of the politeſt <hi>Writers</hi> and their Works; could point out the Beauties in them, and had made many of their beſt Tho'ts her own: And as ſhe went into more free Converſation, ſhe diſcours'd how ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably on many Subjects!</p>
                  <p>I grew by Degrees into ſuch an Opinion of her good <hi>Taſte,</hi> that when ſhe put me upon tranſlating a <hi>Pſalm</hi> or two, I was ready to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe my Self, and if I had not fear'd to diſpleaſe her ſhould have deny'd her Requeſt.</p>
                  <p>After her <hi>Marriage</hi> which was on <hi>Auguſt</hi> 11th. 1726, her Cuſtom was once in a Month or two, to make ſome <hi>new Eſſay</hi> in Verſe or Proſe, and to read from Day to Day as much as a faithful Diſcharge of the Duties of her new Condition gave Leiſure for: and I think I may with Truth ſay, that ſhe made the writing of Poetry a <hi>Recreation</hi> and not a <hi>Buſineſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What greatly contributed to increaſe her Knowlege in <hi>Divinity, Hiſtory, Phyſick, Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy,</hi> as well as <hi>Poetry,</hi> was her attentive hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt that I read upon thoſe Heads thro' the long Evenings of the Winters as we ſat together.</p>

Sometimes my Sins come preſſing on my Mind, and appear ſo black and numerous that I am quite amazed. I look all around, and ſee a World of Vanities, which can yield me no Comfort, much leſs any Help. Only in <hi>Chriſt</hi> is my Help found; O that I had <hi>Faith</hi> to lay hold on him, and <hi>Love</hi> to join my Soul to him! — The laſt Week I was in great Diſtreſs, I could not go to Chriſt, nor hope in him, nor pray to him, nor take any Comfort from any thing I heard, read or diſcours'd about. — I ſeem in a maze, that ſuch a Sinner as I, am ſpar'd from day to day; and admire at the Patience of God in giving me a ſpace for Repentance. O that he would give me Grace to repent!— Often in a Day I think what would become of me if I ſhould die? I think, if it were poſſible, I could open my very Breaſt, and tear the accurſed thing <hi>Sin</hi> out of it. But ſince I can't wholly take it out, or drive it out, I look to God for his Grace that I may more mortify and ſubdue it, and prevent it's reigning in me.— Sometimes I feel in a Tumult by reaſon of <hi>Blaſphemous Tho'ts</hi> crowding in upon me, and wicked, revengeful, quarrelſome Tho'ts riſing up in me. I find alſo raſh paſſionate Expreſſions ready to break thro' the doors of my Lips. Yet I bleſs God who has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd me by his Grace from conſenting to the one, or uttering the other. I hope I can truly ſay, <hi>My Soul abhors them.</hi>— I often mourn the Loſs of that <hi>Time</hi> I have ſpent in reading <hi>uſeleſs Books,</hi> which I am ſenſible had been better improv'd in working out my Souls Salvation. I frequently take up that Lamentation, <hi>"How have I hated Inſtruction,</hi> &amp;c.— I feel my Heart at times <hi>harder than an Adamant,</hi> at other times by reaſon of God's <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors I am Diſtracted.</hi> The Things that <hi>once</hi> appear'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Amuſements, <hi>now</hi> appear to be ſinful. It amazes me to think that one ſo Young as I, ſcarce <hi>Twenty</hi> Years Old, ſhould have heap'd up ſo much Sin and Guilt.

                        <p>I can't but <hi>hope</hi> after all that God has begun a good Work in me; and will he not carry it on and finiſh it? I would hope that in his own Time he will deliver my Soul from all her Sins and Fears — I bleſs God I have not been without Supports and Conſolations from him in my dark Hours.— I have been much at a loſs about laying hold on and applying the Promiſes, and when I have been (ſearching my <hi>Bible</hi> to find out a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that Scripture has come full in my Mind, <hi>What laſt thou to do to take my Covenant into thy Mouth</hi>?—But I have lately met with a Book <note n="*" place="bottom">The Godly Man's Ark.</note> of Mr. <hi>Calamy's</hi> that has greatly inſtructed and comforted me on that Head. —I know not what to think of my Self; ſometimes I fear I never had an Intereſt in Chriſt, but am an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite: At other times I think I am Sincere: I am ſure I deſire to be ſo—I am more mortify'd to the World ſince the <hi>Earthquake,</hi> and love is leſs.

O then improve it to the beſt Purpoſes, leſt you provoke God to deprive you of your Advantages, and take away your <hi>Father</hi> from your Head —O remember your Creator now, even <hi>now</hi> in the Days of your Youth: Let him have your firſt Love and Service: Keep in Mind what Chriſt the Wiſdom of <hi>God</hi> ſays, <hi>I love them that love me, and thoſe that ſeek me early ſhall find me.</hi> Fly to that great <hi>Shepard</hi> who takes the Lambs in his Boſom.

Beg of him his Holy Spirit, and gracious Aſſiſtances; and he will own your Endeavours and accept you. O how does God delight in the Bloſſoms of his Gardens!

                     <p>On the Day after ſhe makes a Record of her Admiſſion, renews the Dedication of her Self to God; and ſeems to have had her Heart much drawn forth to Chriſt, by the vaſt Variety of Expreſſions ſhe uſes on this Occaſion. She writes particularly of the <hi>Earthquake,</hi> and makes many pious and pertinent Reflections and Petitions. 'Lord awaken in me a more lively ſenſe of thy Perfections, and of my Duty towards thee. O cauſe me to ſtand firm in the Truths and Ways of Chriſt. Make me ſtedfaſt in thy Covenant, that I may hold faſt the Profeſſion of my Faith without wavering, &amp;c.'</p>
                     <p>She uſually ſpent a conſiderable part of the Saturday before the <hi>Sacrament</hi> in Preparation for it, and ſometimes other Days.</p>

                     <p>Her ſtrict and cloſe Examinations of her Self before the Sacrament are noted down. The <hi>Word of God</hi> was her Rule, and the Marks and Signs of a good and bad State there given are what ſhe judges upon.— I alſo find her making uſe of the Judgment of the beſt Divines &amp; Caſuiſts. —Two Books one for Devotion, &amp; the other for Inſtruction generally lay on her Table on Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion Days, namely Dr. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s <hi>Chriſtian Sacrifice,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Henry</hi>'s <hi>Communicant</hi>'s <hi>Companion.</hi>

                     <p>In one of her Papers ſhe anſwers all Mr. <hi>Henry</hi>'s <hi>Queſtions,</hi> under the Head of Self-Examination; namely, What <hi>am</hi> I?

                        <hi>Her Frames</hi> at the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Table</hi> were very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, but always conſiſtent with real and vital Religion.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes ſhe ſeems overcome with <hi>Fears,</hi> and born down with Doubts and Scruples; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe has finiſhed her Record there is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Mourning after Chriſt, and an ardent Love to him diſcoverable.</p>
                     <p>There are thoſe which ſhe calls her <hi>uncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Sabbaths and Sacraments,</hi> others her <hi>pleaſant Days</hi> and <hi>joyful Communions.</hi> I obſerve that when ſhe went laden with the moſt Fear, ſhe generally brought home Comfort in return.</p>
                     <p>She writes once, <q>I was exceeding dull and heavy, and ready to go away from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but when I had reſolved to ſtay, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently

                  <p>THE <hi>Reader</hi> will eaſily obſerve, thro' the preceeding <hi>Memoirs,</hi> the great Advantage Mrs. <hi>Turell</hi> had in the early Care of her <hi>Father</hi> to infuſe Knowlege of the beſt Kind, in the eaſieſt and kindeſt Manner, into her little Mind, as faſt as it grew capable of receiving it. He firſt <hi>talk'd</hi> into her all he cou'd in the moſt free and endearing Manner, and then ſupply'd her with the beſt <hi>Books</hi> of every kind, ſuted to her Years and Inclinations, without making them a <hi>Task</hi> and Burthen; which it muſt be own'd was very much owing to her natural <hi>Genius</hi> and Inclination. His next Care was to teach her to <hi>read his Hand,</hi> and then by <hi>writing to her,</hi> in a Manner becoming him and proper for her, he inſinuated himſelf more and more into her Affections, and increas'd her Reverence of Him, and Deſire of his Eſteem. The Way to merit and obtain that, he let her ſee was by a prudent, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, virtuous and religious Conduct, upon the Principles and Motives of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> the Fear of <hi>GOD</hi> and a Deſire to pleaſe her <hi>Heavenly Father.</hi> The Succeſs and Fruit of theſe happy <hi>Methods</hi> have been partly ſeen in the foregoing <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative</hi>; and tho' it can't be pretended that the like Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours will always be attended with like Succeſs, yet it may be ſuppoſed they would very often, if <hi>Parents,</hi> with a humble Reliance on the Bleſſing of God, and Prayers for it, would go into them.</p>

                     <p>YOU were wiſhing laſt Night that I would inſtruct you how to write <hi>Letters,</hi> which I willingly undertake to do by <hi>writing</hi> to You, and requiring you to <hi>anſwer</hi> me as often as I write. I know no Way of teaching you ſo eaſy and pleaſant to me, and that may be ſo profitable to you. I hope it will be a very great Pleaſure to you to hear from <hi>your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> often this Way, and to ſpeak to him again, and to have his loving Lines to you to read over again and again at your Leiſure. Beſides, Your <hi>liſping</hi> at good Senſe will be as <hi>Muſic</hi> to your Father's Ear, and much more your <hi>Growth</hi> the Joy of his Soul.</p>
                     <p>You need not be aſham'd to let your Father ſee your Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norances and <hi>Defects,</hi> for to be ſure he'll kindly <hi>cover</hi> 'em, as well as <hi>inform</hi> you of 'em.</p>
                     <p>A very little <hi>Uſe</hi> will make you Miſtreſs eno' of the Art of decent, familiar, common Letters. <hi>Practice</hi> is the beſt and ſhorteſt Way of learning this; and it will be well worth a little <hi>Pains</hi> to learn, being of conſtant <hi>Uſe</hi> while you live, and not one of the leaſt <hi>Ornaments</hi> and Pleaſures of Life.</p>
                     <p>Write without Fear or Awe to <hi>Him</hi> who is your own, and whoſe you are. Write more or leſs according as you find your Tho'ts flowing or reſtrained. But always remember, that it is better to be <hi>ſhort</hi> and full of good Senſe, than to <hi>draw out</hi> your Letters to an empty Length.</p>
                     <p>Mine to you will be on one Head or other of Religious and Virtuous <hi>Conduct,</hi> wherein I ſhall teach you the Fear of the <hi>Lord</hi> and the Care of your own <hi>Soul,</hi> which are the true and higheſt <hi>Wiſdom.</hi> I ſhall breathe hereby into your Ear, and may it pleaſe God into your Heart, many a good <hi>Wiſh</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> for you to make over again for your Self. And may you find Grace from <hi>God,</hi> to make this Benefit of that tender Affection, which fills the Soul of your <hi>loving Father</hi> ——</p>

                     <p>YOur Letter of the 9th. of this <hi>Month</hi> was exceeding pleaſant to Me and to your Mother, wherein you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs your great Contentment in the kind Diſpoſals of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence reſpecting you.

                     <p>IN your's to me of this Week you ask my Tho'ts about that <note n="‡" place="bottom">See Page 52, &amp; 111.</note> Text, 1 Cor. 11.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, 29. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall eat this Bread, and drink this Cup of the Lord unworthily, ſhall be guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord; he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh Damnation to himſelf, not diſcerning the Lord's Body.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You ſay that it comforted you to find Mr. <hi>Flavel</hi> ſaying, <q>That by <hi>Damnation</hi> here is not meant eternal Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but ſome temporal Judgment and Chaſtiſement in order to the preventing the eternal Damnation.</q>—This is no more than what you have often heard from me and other Miniſters.</p>
                     <p>It is certain that the <hi>Greek Word</hi> render'd here <hi>Damnation,</hi> ſignifies only <hi>Judgment</hi> in general, as the <hi>Margin</hi> of our Bibles renders it. And this Judgment is primarily meant of <hi>temporal</hi> Judgments; as it immediately follows, ver. 30, 31.32. <hi>For this Cauſe many an weak and ſickly among you, and many ſleep; for if we would judge our ſelves, we ſhould not be judged: But when we are judged, we are chaſtned of the Lord, that we ſhould not be condemned with the World.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here, my Dear, you have Mr. <hi>Flavel's</hi> Interpretation in the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s own Words: Scil, that <hi>temporal Judgment and Chaſtiſement is the primary Meaning of that Text,</hi> and this <hi>in order to the preventing eternal Damnation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if you look into the <hi>Context,</hi> you will eaſily ſee how <hi>groſs and ſoul</hi> the unworthy Eating among the <hi>Corinthians</hi> was. They acted after ſuch a manner that the Apoſtle told them ver. 20. <hi>That it was not to eat the Lord's Supper.</hi> They
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:003888_0135_100398F47B76CF10"/>
did not <hi>diſcern the Lord's Body.</hi> They made a kind of <hi>common Meal</hi> of it. The Abuſe of their <hi>Love-Feaſts,</hi> us'd before the Sacrament among them, was the Occaſion hereof. The poor were neglected, every one <hi>took his own Supper; one was hungry and another was drunken</hi>! ver. 21. <hi>What,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>Have ye not Houſes to eat and drink in? or deſpiſe ye the Church of God</hi>? ver. 22. Here was groſs Diſorder indeed, even to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance; ſuch as is not like to be known among us. Wherefore, neither are the like temporal Judgments known among us on this Account, as were inflicted upon thoſe <hi>Corinthians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if People do incur the <hi>Judgments</hi> of God by <hi>unſuitable partaking</hi> at the Lord's Table, Do they not equally by a <hi>careleſs Omiſſion</hi> and irreverent and prophane <hi>Neglect</hi> of it, think you? Is not the <hi>Reaſon</hi> the ſame? the <hi>Irreligion</hi> and Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation the ſame? And ſo may the <hi>Danger</hi> be juſtly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended.</p>
                     <p>Indeed either the <hi>"Omiſſion or careleſs Performance</hi> of the holy Duties of God's Worſhip, ſecret or publick, do juſtly expoſe People to the Judgments of God, both bodily and ſpiritual, temporal and eternal. And the <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Judgments we ſhould eſpecially fear. And if People habitually and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanely and impenitently <hi>ſtay away</hi> from the Lord's Table, or <hi>come</hi> to it; both the one and the other will turn to their <hi>Damnation</hi> in the World to come.</p>
                     <p>But what is the Inference or <hi>Argument</hi> from hence? Is it not that therefore we ſhould religiouſly <hi>prepare</hi> for, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently <hi>come</hi> to the Ordinances of Chriſt? We muſt nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>ſtay away</hi> from them, nor <hi>prophane</hi> them in the Uſe of them; for <hi>both</hi> of theſe Errors will alike incur the Judgment of God, here and hereafter, without Repentance</p>
                     <p>And think my <hi>Dear,</hi> Is it only by <hi>Eating</hi> and <hi>Drinking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily,</hi> that the Judgment of God is incurred? Is it not alſo by <hi>unworthy Praying</hi>? For it is ſaid, That the <hi>Prayer</hi> of the wicked is an <hi>Abomination</hi> to the Lord. Is not <hi>this</hi> as dreadful as the Word <hi>Judgment</hi>? And do we not read of the <hi>Word Preached,</hi> that it will become a <hi>Savour of Death unto Death</hi> by our <hi>unworthy hearing</hi> it? Here is <hi>eternal</hi> Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation indeed in theſe fearful words, <hi>Death unto Death.</hi> Let us fear then to <hi>pray</hi> and <hi>hear</hi> unworthily, as well as to <hi>eat</hi> unworthily. But to be ſure we may <hi>not</hi> ſay, "Well then, it is beſt <hi>not</hi> to pray at all, and beſt <hi>not</hi> to hear at all, leſt I bring Judgment and Condemnation upon my ſelf: No more ſhould we ſay—I will <hi>not</hi> dare to go to the Lord's Table for the ſame Reaſon.</p>

                        <pb n="126" facs="unknown:003888_0136_100398FAA17E6AC8"/>In a word, If we prophane the <hi>Sabbaths</hi> and <hi>Ordinances</hi> of Chriſt, it will be to our Judgment, both on temporal and ſpiritual Accounts; and they will be prophaned by us, if they are not reverently obſerved by us. The Rule there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is, ver. 28. <hi>Let a Man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup.</hi> So let a Man <hi>examine</hi> himſelf, and prepare for the <hi>other</hi> Ordinances of Chriſt. <hi>Keep thy foot when thou goeſt to the Houſe of God, and offer not the Sacrifice of Fools who conſider not that they do Evil.</hi> Be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn, ſerious, and reverend in the <hi>whole</hi> worſhip of God, for it is all <hi>holy,</hi> and God will be <hi>ſanctifyed</hi> in it by us, or will ſanctify himſelf upon us.</p>

I. 5. See <hi>there</hi> the Frame, and Voice, and Act of a Soul preparing, or thro' Grace prepared, for the renewing and confirming its <hi>Covenant</hi> with God. Both the <hi>Duty</hi> and the <hi>Grace</hi> of the Covenant are wonderfully expreſſed in this <hi>Phraſe.</hi> A Word of wonderful <hi>Condeſcention</hi> on the part of <hi>God,</hi> and of ſtrong <hi>Obligation</hi> and Binding on <hi>ours.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For in Covenanting with God we <hi>joyn our ſelves</hi> to Him, as <hi>Servants to their Maſter</hi> by an Indenture; as <hi>Subjects to their King</hi> by an Oath of Allegiance; as <hi>Soldiers to their General</hi> in a War againſt Sin and Satan; and as a <hi>Wife to her Husband</hi> in a Marriage Covenant; a <hi>Covenant</hi> of mutual, endearing, conſtant and perpetual <hi>Love.</hi>—O with what a conſenting joyful Soul, ſhould you now (my Deareſt, my Joy and my Crown!) make your <hi>Vows</hi> to God! Let <hi>the Love of Chriſt conſtrain thee.</hi> Say, <q>I will go unto the Altar of God, unto God my exceeding Joy! I will take the Cup of Salvation and call upon the Name of the Lord! I will pay my Vows unto the Lord, now in the Preſence of all his People.</q> O what a <hi>Mercy,</hi> and Matter of everlaſting Thankſgiving, is a <hi>Heart</hi> thus given to <hi>Chriſt!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And remember, that what you do is <hi>for Perpetuity,</hi> never to be forgotten. We Covenant for Life and for <hi>Eternity.</hi> It is the Covenant of the <hi>Living God,</hi> with <hi>Immortal</hi> Creatures, for our whole Being here, and for our eternal Well being in another World. We muſt reverently uſe the <hi>Signs &amp; Seals</hi> of the Covenant of our God, to keep in Memory our <hi>Bonds</hi> and God's <hi>Promiſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is a Sketch of the <hi>Sermon</hi> I might have brought you, had my Health and the Weather permitted me. It may lie by you, be reviewed on Occaſion, and do you more good, than if I had come and preach'd to you. <hi>Grace be with you.</hi> Amen.</p>
