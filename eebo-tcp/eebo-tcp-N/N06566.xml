            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AS the following Pages contain the <hi>Genuine Sentiments</hi> of a Heart full of Zeal for the Honour of his Majeſty King <hi>GEORGE,</hi> and a juſt Indignation againſt a baſe, cowardly Neglect, to defend the civil and religious Liberties of <hi>Britiſh</hi> America, they cannot be unacceptable to your Lordſhip.</p>
            <p>This Diſcourſe having a direct Tendency to raiſe a <hi>Noble Spirit</hi> among the Inhabitants of the Weſtern World, whoſe Territories have been firſt inſidiouſly curtailed, and then openly attacked by the perfidious and reſtleſs Diſturber of the Peace, both of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> the Circulating thereof muſt neceſſarily be a Matter of no ſmall Importance.</p>
            <p>Here Courage is ſet upon its proper Baſis, which will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce more ſolid, ſteady and perſevering Vigour, than any Methods that are or can be taken, merely to inflame the Paſſions, for that is only to intoxicate Men with Rage, and temporary Phrenſy.</p>

The Author's Friendſhip ſent the Manuſcript croſs the <hi>Atlantick</hi> to my Hands; and having read it, I thought it would be criminal to conceal ſuch generous Principles, and powerful Motives to his Majeſty's Service, from the Publick, either in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſhould You, my Lord, think fit to introduce this <hi>American</hi> Compoſition to His Majeſty's View, muſt it not give Him a real Satisfaction, to ſee the grateful Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the Inhabitants of that Country have of His <hi>paternal Care,</hi> and that there is among them a Spirit of <hi>undiſſembled Loyalty</hi> to His Perſon, and moſt <hi>ardent Zeal</hi> in His Service, not altogether unworthy of His Royal Regard?</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip's juſt Senſe of the Utility and Importance of the <hi>Britiſh Colonies</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> and conſtant Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs over them, as myſelf and all others that have Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions there, know; have gain'd You, Sir, the univerſal Eſteem of the Inhabitants of that extenſive and now populous Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.</p>
            <p>Permit me then, with the moſt profound Reſpect, to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to your Lordſhip, what I apprehend is ſo well calculated to promote His Majeſty's Service, and the vigorous Defence of His Dominions in general: And if ſpreading theſe Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Country which gave them Birth, ſhould have that happy Effect, I ſhall eſteem it an additional Honour to that of being permitted to ſubſcribe myſelf,</p>

            <p>NOTHING can be more agreeable to the God of Peace, than to ſee univerſal Harmony and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence prevail among his Creatures; and He has laid them under the ſtrongeſt Obligations to cultivate a pacific Temper towards one another, both as Individuals, and as Nations. <hi>Follow Peace with all Men,</hi> is one of the principal Precepts of our holy Religion. And the great Prince of Peace has ſolemnly pronounced, <hi>Bleſſed are the Peace-makers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when, in this corrupt diſordered State of Things, where the Luſts of Men are perpetually embroiling the World with Wars and Fightings, and throwing all into Confuſion; when Ambition and Avarice would rob us of our Property, for which we have toiled, and on which we ſubſiſt; when they would enſlave the free-born Mind, and compel us meanly to cringe to Uſurpation and arbitrary Power; when they would tear from our eager Graſp the moſt valuable Bleſſing of Heaven, I mean our RELIGION; when they invade our Country, formerly the Region of Tranquillity, ravage our Frontiers, butcher our Fellow-Subjects, or confine them in a barbarous Captivity in the Dens of Savages; when our <hi>earthly</hi> All is ready to be ſeized by rapacious Hands, and even our <hi>Eternal</hi> All is in Danger by the Loſs of our Religion: when this is the Caſe, what is then the Will of God? Muſt Peace then be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained? maintained with our perfidious and cruel Invaders?
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:008333_0006_102F326EDC8204F8"/>maintained at the Expence of Property, Liberty, Life, and every Thing dear and valuable? maintained, when it is in our Power to vindicate our Right, and do ourſelves Juſtice? Is the Work of Peace then our only Buſineſs? No; in ſuch a Time even the God of Peace proclaims by his Providence, TO ARMS! Then the <hi>Sword</hi> is, as it were, <hi>conſecrated</hi> to God; and the Art of WAR becomes a Part of our Religion. Then happy is he that ſhall reward our Enemies as they have ſerved us.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Pſal</hi> cxxxvii. 8.</note> Bleſſed is the brave Soldier; bleſſed is the Defender of his Country, and the Deſtroyer of its Enemies. Bleſſed are they who offer themſelves willingly in this Service, and who faithfully diſcharge it. But on the other Hand, <hi>Curſed is he that doth the Work of the Lord deceitfully; and curſed is he that keepeth back his Sword from Blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the original Reference and Meaning of theſe Words, it is ſufficient to my Purpoſe to obſerve, That the <hi>Moabites,</hi> againſt whom this Prophecy was immediately denounced, were a troubleſome and reſtleſs Nation in the Neighbourhood of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who, tho' often ſubdued by them, as <hi>France</hi> has been by <hi>England,</hi> yet upon every Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſtruggled to recover their Power, and renewed their Hoſtilities. By this, and various other Steps, they were arrived to the higheſt Pitch of national Guilt, and ripe for Execution. The <hi>Babylonians</hi> were commiſſioned for this Work of Vengeance; and they were bound to execute the Commiſſion faithfully, under the Penalty of a Curſe. To them this Denunciation was immediately directed, <hi>Curſed be he that doth the Work of the Lord deceitfully,</hi> or negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently; <hi>and curſed be he that keepeth back his Sword from Blood.</hi> This is expreſſed in the Form of an Imprecation, or an authoritative Denunciation of a Curſe: And in this Form it might be uſed, conſiſtently with Benevolence, by a Prophet ſpeaking as the Mouth of God. But this is not a Pattern for our Imitation, who are peculiarly obliged under the Goſpel, to <hi>Bleſs, and curſe not,</hi> and to <hi>pray for all Men.</hi> However, it may be pronounced even by our Lips as a Declaration of the righteous Curſe of God againſt a da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtardly Refuſal to engage in War, when it is our Duty; or
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:008333_0007_102F3272D973CAF8"/>a deceitful negligent Diſcharge of that Duty, after we have engaged in it. Theſe are the Crimes that ſeem intended in my Text; and againſt each of theſe the tremendous Curſe of JEHOVAH is ſtill in full Force in all Ages, even under the mild and gentle Diſpenſation or the Goſpel. Cowardice and Treachery are now as execrable as ever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Curſed be he that keepeth back his Sword from Blood. —</hi> This Denunciation, like the Artillery of Heaven, is leveled againſt the mean, ſneaking Coward, who, when God, in the Courſe of his Providence, calls him to Arms, refuſes to obey, and conſults his own Eaſe and Safety, more than his Duty to God and his Country.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Curſed be he that doth the Work of the Lord deceitfully.</hi>— This ſeems to be leveled againſt another Species of Cowards; ſly, hypocritical Cowards, who undertake the Work of the Lord, that is, take up Arms; but they do the Work of the Lord <hi>deceitfully,</hi> that is, they do not faithfully uſe their Arms for the Purpoſes they were taken up. They com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence Soldiers, not that they may ſerve their Country, and do their Duty to God, but that they may live in Eaſe, Idleneſs and Pleaſure, and enrich themſelves at the public Expence. <hi>Curſed is he that doth the Work of the Lord deceitfully.</hi> and ſerves himſelf under Pretence of ſerving his Country.</p>
            <p>You, Gentlemen and others, whom I this Day behold with peculiar Pleaſure, engaged in the Cauſe of your neglected Country, and who have done me the Honour of inviting me to this Service; a Service which I am ſure I ſhould perform to your Satisfaction, if my Preparations and Abilities were proportioned to my Benevolence for you, and my Concern for your Succeſs: You are peculiarly inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in the Remarks I have made upon the Text. And that I may contribute all in my Power both to increaſe your Number, and direct you to a proper Conduct in the honourable Character you ſuſtain, I ſhall lay before you a brief View of the preſent Circumſtances of our Country, from which it will appear, that the War in which we are engaged is a Duty, or THE WORK OF THE LORD;
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:008333_0008_102F3274730E6770"/>and conſequently, that we are all obliged, according to our reſpective Characters, to carry it on with Vigour, under Penalty of falling under the Curſe of God. And then I ſhall ſhew you what is the deceitful Performance of the Lord's Work, or unſeaſonably keeping back of the Sword from Blood, which expoſes to the Curſe.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I am to lay before you a brief View of the preſent Circumſtances of our Country, which render the War in which we are engaged the Work of the Lord, which conſecrate Swords as Inſtruments of Righteouſneſs, and call us to the dreadful but important Duty of ſhedding of human Blood, upon Penalty of falling under the tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous Curſe of God.</p>
            <p>Need I inform you what Barbarities and Depredations a mongrel Race of Indian Savages and French Papiſts have perpetrated upon our Frontiers? How many deſerted or demoliſhed Houſes and Plantations! How wide an Extent of Country abandoned! How many poor Families obliged to fly in Conſternation, and leave their All behind them! What Breaches and Separations between the neareſt Relations! What painful Ruptures of Heart from Heart! What ſhocking Diſperſions of thoſe once united by the ſtrongeſt and moſt endearing Ties! Some lie dead, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with ſavage Wounds, conſumed to Aſhes with out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous Flames, or torn and devoured by the Beaſts of the Wilderneſs, while their Bones lie whitening in the Sun, and ſerve as tragical Memorials of the fatal Spot where they fell. Others have been dragged away Captives, and made the Slaves of imperious and cruel Savages. Others have made their Eſcape, and live to lament their butchered or captivated Friends and Relations. In ſhort, our Frontiers have been drenched with the Blood of our Fellow-Subjects, through the Length of a thouſand Miles; and new Wounds are ſtill opening. We, in theſe inland Parts of the Country, are as yet unmoleſted, through the immerited Mercy of Heaven. But let us glance a Thought to the Weſtern Extremities of our Body Politick; and
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:008333_0009_102F32760A9E27A8"/>what melancholy Scenes open to our View! Now, perhaps, while I am ſpeaking; now, while you are ſecure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moleſted, our Fellow-Subjects there may be feeling the Calamities I am deſcribing. Now, perhaps, the ſavage Shouts and Whoops of Indians, and the Screams and Groans of ſome butchered Family, may be mingling their Horrors, and circulating their horrendous Echoes thro' the Wilderneſs of Rocks and Mountains. Now, perhaps ſome tender delicate Creature may be ſuffering an invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Proſtitution to ſavage Luſt; and perhaps debauched and murdered by the ſame Hand. Now, perhaps, ſome miſerable <hi>Briton</hi> or <hi>Virginian</hi> may be paſſing through a tedious Proceſs of Experiments in the infernal Art of Torture. Now ſome helpleſs Children may be torn from the Arms of their murdered Parents, and dragged away weeping and wringing their Hands, to receive their Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation among Barbarians, and to be formed upon the Model of a ferocious Indian Soul.</p>
            <p>And will theſe Violences ceaſe without a vigorous and timely Reſiſtance from us? Can Indian Revenge and Thirſt for Blood be glutted? or can French Ambition and Avarice be ſatisfied? No, we have no Method left, but to repel Force with Force, and give them Blood to drink in their Turn, who have drunk ours. If we ſit ſtill and do nothing, or content ourſelves, as alas! we have hitherto, with feeble dilatory Efforts, we may expect theſe Barbarities will not only continue, but that the Indians, headed by the French, thoſe eternal Enemies of Peace, Liberty and Britons, will carry their Inroads ſtill farther into the Country, and reach even to us. By the Deſertion of our remote Settlements, the Frontiers are approaching every Day nearer and nearer to us: And if we cannot ſtand our Ground now, when we have above an hundred Miles of a thick-ſettled Country between us and the Enemy, much leſs ſhall we be able, when our Strength is weakened by ſo vaſt a Loſs of Men, Arms and Riches, and we lie expoſed to their immediate Incurſions. Some cry, <q>Let the Enemy come down to us, and then we
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:008333_0010_102F327799A65478"/>will fight them.</q> But this is the trifling Excuſe of Cowardice or Security, and not the Language of Prudence and Fortitude. Thoſe who make this Plea, if the Enemy ſhould take them at their Word, and make them ſo near a Viſit, would be as forward in Flight, as they are now backward to take up Arms.</p>
            <p>Such, my Brethren, ſuch, alas! is the preſent State of our Country: It bleeds in a thouſand Veins; and without a timely Remedy, the Wound will prove mortal. And in ſuch Circumſtances, is it not our Duty in the Sight of God; is it not a Work to which the Lord loudly calls us, to take up Arms for the Defence of our Country? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is; and <hi>Curſed is he,</hi> who having no Ties ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſtrong to confine him at Home, <hi>keepeth his Sword from Blood.</hi> The mean, ſneaking Wretch, that can deſert the Cauſe of his Country in ſuch an Exigency; his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in the Bleſſings of which he ſhared, while in Peace and Proſperity; and which is therefore intitled to his Sympathy and Aſſiſtance in the Day of its Diſtreſs; that cowardly ungrateful Wretch ſins againſt God and his Country; and deſerves the Curſe of both. Such a Conduct in ſuch a Conjuncture, is a <hi>moral Evil,</hi> a groſs Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and expoſes the Wretch to the heavy Curſe of God both in this and the eternal World.</p>
            <p>And here I cannot but obſerve, that among the various and numberleſs Sins under which our Country groans, and which muſt be looked upon as the Cauſes of our publick Calamities, by every one that believes a Divine Providence; (a Doctrine ſo comfortable, and ſo eſſential both in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and Revealed Religion; an Article in the Creed of Heathens and Mahometans, as well as Jews and Chriſtians) I ſay among theſe various Sins, Cowardice and Security are none of the leaſt. He that hath determined the Bounds of our Habitation, hath planted us in a Land of Liberty and Plenty; a Land, till lately, unalarmed with the Terrors of War, and unſtained with human Blood: Indeed, all Things conſidered, there are but few ſuch happy Spots upon our Globe. And muſt it not highly
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:008333_0011_102F327CB3ED6178"/>provoke our Divine Benefactor, to ſee a People thus diſtinguiſhed with Bleſſings, ſo inſenſible of their Worth, ſo ungrateful for them, and ſo unacquainted with their own Unworthineſs to receive them? What can be more evidential of their undue Apprehenſions of the Worth of theſe Bleſſings, than their being ſo little concerned to ſecure and recover them? The Generality among us have acted, as if their Intereſts at Stake were ſo trifling, that it would not be worth While to take Pains, or encounter Dangers, to preſerve them. What greater Evidence can be given of Ingratitude, than a ſupine Neglect of theſe Bleſſings, and ſuch a ſtupidly tame and irreſiſting Reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of them into bloody and rapacious Hands? And what can be more evidential of a proud Inſenſibility of our Unworthineſs of ſuch Bleſſings, than our being ſo inapprehenſive of loſing them, even in the moſt threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and dangerous Circumſtances? Our Countrymen in general have acted, as if Beings of their Importance and Merit might certainly reſt in the quiet unmoleſted Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their Liberty and Property, without any one daring to diſturb them, and without their doing any Thing for their own Defence; or as if neither God nor Man could ſtrip them of their Enjoyments. What vain ſelf-confident Preſumption, what intolerable Inſolence is this, in a ſinful Nation, a People laden with Iniquity, who have forfeited every Bleſſing, even the Ground they tread upon, and the Air they breathe in; and who live meerly by the immerited Grace, and Bounty of God! Is not Cowardice and Security, or an Unwillingneſs to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage with all our Might in the Defence of our Country, in ſuch a Situation, an enormous <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> in the Sight of God, and worthy of his Curſe, as well as a ſcandalous daſtardly <hi>Meanneſs</hi> in the Sight of Men, and worthy of publick Shame and Indignation? Is it not fit that thoſe who ſo contemptuouſly depreciate the rich and undeſerved Bounties of Heaven, and who ſwell ſo inſolently with a vain Conceit of their own Importance and Worth, ſhould be puniſhed with the Loſs of theſe Bleſſings? What Diſcipline can be more ſeaſonable or congruous?
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:008333_0012_102F327EA9D20E00"/>May we not ſuppoſe, that Divine Providence has permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted our Body Politick to ſuffer Wound after Wound, and baffled all our languid Efforts, in order to give it Senſibility, and rouſe us to exert our Strength in more vigorous Efforts? Has not the Curſe of God lain heavy upon our Country, becauſe we have <hi>done the Work of the Lord deceitfully, and kept back our Swords from Blood?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſhall this Guilt increaſe from Year to Year, till we are entirely cruſhed with the enormous Load? Shall neither the Fear of JEHOVAH'S Curſe, nor the Love of our Country, nor even the Love of ourſelves, and our own perſonal Intereſt, conſtrain us at Length to relieve our ravaged Country, and defend the Bleſſings which God has entruſted to our Cuſtody, as well as lent to us to enjoy? — Bleſſed be God, and Thanks to you, brave Soldiers for what I now ſee. I ſee you engaged in this good Cauſe; and may the effectual Bleſſing of Heaven be upon you, inſtead of the Curſe entailed upon Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice and Treachery! But are there no more to join with you? what! none more in this Crowd? None more in Hanover? Hanover! which I think ſhould ſhew itſelf worthy of Precedence, and exhibit a brave Example to other Counties: This is what may reaſonably be expected, from the Number of our Militia, the high Price of our Staple Commodity, the Frequency and Variety of our religious Inſtructions; and I may add, from our own former good Conduct in ſuch an Emergency. Hanover had the Honour of ſending out the firſt Company of Volunteers that were raiſed in this Colony.<note n="*" place="bottom">Under Capt. <hi>Averton,</hi> immediately after Gen. <hi>Braddock</hi>'s Defeat.</note> And are we degenerated ſo ſoon? Or is our Danger leſs now, than immediately after <hi>Braddock</hi>'s Defeat? Or are we now inured and hardened to bad News, ſo that the Calamities of our Frontiers, which have been growing every Year, have now ceaſed to be Objects of our Compaſſion?</p>
            <p>I am ſorry to tell you, that the Company now forming, is not yet compleated, though under Officers from among yourſelves, from whom you may expect good Uſage;
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:008333_0013_102F328212660988"/>and the Encouragement is ſo unuſually great, and the Time of Service ſo ſhort.<note n="†" place="bottom">Only till the firſt of December next.</note> May I not reaſonably inſiſt upon it, that the Company be made up this very Day before we leave this Place? Methinks your King, your Country, nay, your own Intereſts command me; and therefore I muſt inſiſt upon It.—Oh! for the all-prevailing Force of Demoſthenes's Oratory,—but I recall my Wiſh, that I may correct it,—Oh! for the Influence of the Lord of Armies, the God of Battles, the Author of true Courage, and every heroic Virtue, to fire you into Patriots and Soldiers this Moment! — Ye young and hardy Men, whoſe very Faces ſeem to ſpeak that God and Nature formed you for Soldiers, who are free from the Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Families depending on you for Subſiſtence, and who are perhaps but of little Service to Society, while at Home, may I not ſpeak for you, and declare as your Mouth, <q>Here we are, all ready to abandon our Eaſe, and ruſh into the glorious Dangers of the Field, in Defence of our Country?</q> Ye that love your Country, enliſt; for Honour will follow you in Life or Death in ſuch a Cauſe. You that love your Religion, enliſt; for your Religion is in Danger. Can Proteſtant Chriſtianity expect Quarters from Heathen Savages and French Papiſts? Sure in ſuch an Alliance, the Powers of Hell make a third Party. Ye that love your Friends and Relations, enliſt; leſt ye ſee them enſlaved or butchered before your Eyes. Ye that would catch at Money, here is a proper Bait for you; ten Pounds for a few Months Service, beſides the uſual Pay of Soldiers. I ſeriouſly make the Propoſal to you, not only as a Subject of the beſt of Kings, and a Friend to your Country, but as <hi>a Servant of the moſt High God:</hi> for I am fully perſuaded what I am recommending, is his Will; and Diſobedience to it may expoſe you to his Curſe.</p>
            <p>This Propoſal is not liable to the Objections that have been urged againſt former Meaſures for raiſing Men. You can no longer object, <q>that you are dragged away
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:008333_0014_102F32860BA5B468"/>like Slaves againſt your Wills, while others are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reaſon exempted:</q> For now it is left to your own Honour, and you may act as free Men. Nor can you object, <q>that you are arbitrarily thruſt under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of foreign, unknown, or diſagreeable Officers:</q> for the Gentleman that has the immediate Command of this Company, and his ſubordinate Officers, are of your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, your Neighbours Children, and perhaps your old Companions. And I hope I may add, you need not object, that you ſhall be badly uſed: For, GENTLEMEN-OFFICERS, may I not promiſe for you, that not one Man in your Company ſhall be treated with Cruelty or Injuſtice, as far as your Authority or Influence can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent? May I not be your Security, that none but the Guilty ſhall be puniſhed, and they only according to the Nature of the Offence? Perhaps ſome may object, that ſhould they enter the Army, their Morals would be in Danger of Infection, and their Virtue would be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ſhocked with horrid Scenes of Vice. This may alſo be a Diſcouragement to Parents to conſent to their Children's engaging in ſo good a Cauſe. I am glad to hear this Objection, when it is ſincere, and not an empty Excuſe: And I wiſh I could remove it, by giving you an univerſal Aſſurance, that the Army is a School of Religion; and that Soldiers, as they are more expoſed to Death than other Men, are proportionably better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for it than others. But alas! the Reverſe of this is too true; and the Contagion of Vice and Irreligion is perhaps no where ſtronger than in the Army; where, one would think, the ſupreme Tribunal ſhould be always in View, and it ſhould be their chief Care to prepare for Eternity, on the ſlippery Brink of which they ſtand every Moment. But, GENTLEMEN-OFFICERS, I muſt again appeal to you, that as for this Company, you will not Impunity; but will always endeavour to recommend and willingly allow any Form of Vice to be practiſed in it with enforce Religion and good Morals by your Example and Authority, and to ſuppreſs the contrary? May I not give
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:008333_0015_102F328A0B5B6CC8"/>the Public the Satisfaction of ſuch an Aſſurance concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning you, that whatever others do, as for you and your Company any you will ſerve the Lord? Do you not own yourſelves bound to this in Honour and Duty? Such a Conduct I can aſſure you, will render you popular among the Wiſe and Good; tho' perhaps it may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you to the ſenſeleſs Contempt of Fools, who <hi>make a Mock of Sin,</hi> and who eſteem it Bravery to inſult that God, <hi>in whoſe Hand their Breath is, and whoſe are all their Ways.</hi> Such a Conduct will afford you Pleaſure in the Review, when the Terrors of the bloody Field are ſpread round you, and Death ſtarts up before you in a thouſand ſhocking Forms. Such a Conduct will be a Source of true Courage, and render you nobly indifferent about Life or Death in a good Cauſe. And let me honeſtly warn you, that if you do not maintain ſuch a Conduct, you will bitterly repent it either in Time, or Eternity.</p>
            <p>But I return to invite others to join with you in this important Expedition.—What a Crowd of important Arguments preſs you on every Hand? What can our Legiſlature do more, than they have done to engage you? If ſuch unuſual Encouragement does not prevail upon you to enliſt as <hi>Volunteers,</hi> what remains but that you muſt be <hi>forced</hi> to it by Authority? For our Country <hi>muſt</hi> be defended: and if nothing but <hi>Force</hi> can conſtrain you to take up Arms in its Defence, then Force <hi>muſt</hi> be uſed: Perſons of ſuch a ſordid unmanly Spirit, are not to expect the Uſage of <hi>Freemen.</hi>—Think what the paternal Care or our Sovereign has done for us: and how many Millions of Money, and Thouſands of Men our Mother-Country has furniſhed for our Defence. And ſhall we do nothing for ourſelves? Great-Britain, I own, is inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in our Protection: But can ſhe be as much inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted as ourſelves?—Conſider what the brave New-England Men have done, after ſo many Mortifications and Diſappointments, and their Treaſury ſo much exhauſted. By the beſt Accounts I have had, the little
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:008333_0016_102F328BA3671858"/>Colony of Maſſachuſets-Bay, has raiſed no leſs than 7000 Men, tho' not larger perhaps than 15 or 20 of thoſe 53 Counties contained in Virginia. And ſince we have the ſame Intereſts at Stake, ſhall not we chearfully furniſh our Quota for the public Service?—We all admire the Bravery and Succeſs of the King of Pruſſia: But his Succeſs muſt be greatly owing to the Bravery of his <hi>Subjects,</hi> as well as his <hi>own:</hi> He has almoſt as many Soldiers as Subjects. And while he has almoſt <hi>miraculouſly</hi> ſtood his Ground againſt ſuch ſuperior Numbers; ſhall we, with the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Numbers on our Side, be perpetually flying before a pitiful Enemy, and tamely give up our Country to their Ravages: Let us ſtrenuouſly exert that ſuperior Force, which a gracious Providence has put into our Hands: And we may ſoon expect, thro' the Concurrence of Heaven, that we ſhall again enjoy the Bleſſings of Peace. Whatever Intelligence our artful Enemies may ſend, or the Cowardly among ourſelves may believe <note n="†" place="bottom">It is generally believed, and all the expenſive Preparations of laſt Year were rendered fruitleſs, by falſe Accounts of the ſuperior Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Enemy at Louiſbourg, &amp;c.</note>, there is no Reaſon to conclude, that the French Regulars upon this Continent are half to many as ours: and as to the <hi>Coloni,</hi> or Country-militia, we are certainly 20, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps 40, to one. Let us then, in the Name of the Lord of Hoſts, the God of the Armies of Iſrael, let us collect our whole Strength, and give one deciſive Blow; and we may humbly hope Victory will be ours.</p>
            <p>Every one can complain of the bad Management of our public Undertakings, and lament the general Security and Inactivity that prevails. Every one can wiſh that Something were effectually done, and that this and that Perſon would enliſt, Every one can tell, what great Atchievements he <hi>would</hi> perform, were it not for this and that, and a hundred Obſtructions in his Way. But this idle Complaining, Wiſhing and Lamenting, and Boaſting will anſwer no End. SOMETHING MUST BE DONE! muſt be done BY YOU! Therefore, inſtead of aſſuming the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:008333_0017_102F328D6FE57980"/>State of Patriots and Heroes at home. TO ARMS! and away to the Field, and prove your Pretenſions ſincere. Let the Thunder of this Imprecation rouſe you out of your Eaſe, and Security, <q>Curſed be he that doth the Work of the Lord deceitfully; and curſed be he that keepeth back his Sword from Blood.</q> God ſent an Angel from Heaven to curſe the daſtardly Inhabitants of Meroz, who refuſed to take up Arms for the Defence of their Country. (Judges v. 23.) <q>Curſe ye Meroz, ſaid the Angel of the Lord, curſe ye bitterly the Inhabitants thereof: becauſe they came not to the Help of the Lord, to the Help of the Lord againſt the Mighty.</q> And ſhall this Curſe fall upon Virginia? No, fly from it, by venturing your Lives for your Country for this Curſe is far more terrible than any Thing that can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal you in the Field of Battle.—But it is not enough for you to <hi>undertake</hi> this Work: you are alſo obliged <hi>faithfully to perform</hi> it, as the Work of the Lord. And this leads me,</p>
            <p n="2">II. To ſhew you, what is that deceitful Performance of the Lord's Work, or unſeaſonable keeping back the Sword from Blood, which expoſes to his Curſe.</p>
            <p>If Soldiers, inſtead of abandoning their Eaſe and Pleaſure, and riſquing their Lives in Defence of their Country, ſhould unman themſelves with ſenſual Pleaſures and Debauchery; if, inſtead of ſearching out the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, they keep out of their Way, leſt they ſhould ſearch out and find them; if they lie ſleeping or rioting in Forts and Places of Safety, while their Country is ravaged, perhaps in their very Neighbourhood: when they waſte their Courage in Broils and Duels among themſelves, or in tyrannizing over thoſe that are under their Command: when they lay themſelves open to falſe Alarms, by being credulous to every Account that mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the Force of the Enemy: when they are tedious or divided in their Conſultations, and ſlow and faint in the Execution: when they conſult rather what may
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:008333_0018_102F32901AB52880"/>be moſt <hi>ſafe for themſelves,</hi> than moſt <hi>beneficial to their Country:</hi> when they keep ſkirmiſhing at a Diſtance, inſtead of making a bold Puſh, and bringing the War to a ſpeedy Iſſue by a deciſive Stroke: when they are fond of prolonging the War, that they may live and riot the longer at the public Expence: when they ſell themſelves and their Country to the Enemy for a Bribe: In ſhort, when they do not conſcientiouſly exert all their Power to repel the Enemy, and protect the State that employs them, but only ſeek to ſerve themſelves; then they do the Work of the Lord deceitfully; and his Curſe lights upon them as their heavy Doom: I leave others to judge, whether the Original of this ugly Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is to be found any where in the Univerſe. But as for you of this Company, may I not preſume that you will behave in a nobler Manner? Shall not Sobriety, public Spirit, Courage, Fidelity, and good Diſcipline be maintained among you? This I humbly recommend to you; and may God enable you to act accordingly!</p>
            <p>Thus far have I addreſſed you as <hi>Soldiers,</hi> or at leaſt as Perſons concerned in your Stations to do all in your Power to ſave your Country. But we muſt not part thus. It is poſſible we may never meet more, till we mingle with the aſſembled Univerſe before the ſupreme Tribunal: Therefore, before I diſmiſs you, I muſt addreſs myſelf to you as <hi>Sinners,</hi> and as <hi>Candidates for Eternity.</hi> You are concerned to ſave your <hi>Souls,</hi> as well as your <hi>Country;</hi> and ſhould you ſave or gain a Kingdom, or even the whole World, and loſe your Souls, your Loſs will be irreparable.</p>
            <p>None of you I hope will reply, <q>I am now a Soldier, and have nothing more to do with Religion?</q> What! has a Soldier Nothing to do with Religion? Is a Soldier under no Obligations to the God that made him, and that furniſhes him with every Bleſſing? Is not a Soldier as much expoſed to Death as other Men? May not a ſoldier be damned for as Sin, as well as other Sinners? And will he be able to dwell with devouring Fire and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:008333_0019_102F329498C71FD8"/>everlaſting Burnings? Are theſe Things ſo? Can any of you be ſo ſtupid as to think them ſo? If not, you muſt own, that even a <hi>Soldier</hi> has as much Concern with Religion, as another. Therefore hear me ſeriouſly upon this Head.</p>
            <p>You are about entering into <hi>the School of Vice:</hi> for ſuch the Army has generally been. And are any of you already initiated into any of the Myſteries of Iniquity there prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed? Muſt I ſo much as ſuppoſe, that ſome of you, who have bravely eſpouſed the Cauſe of your Country, are addicted to Drunkenneſs, Swearing, Whoredom, or any groſs Vice? I cannot now take Time to reaſon with you for your Conviction; it may ſuffice to appeal to your own Reaſon and Conſcience; Do you do well in indulging theſe Vices? Will you approve of it in the honeſt Hour of Death? Will this Conduct prove a Source of Courage to you, when the Arrows of Death are flying thick around you, and Scores are falling on every Side? No, you are ſelf-condemned; and may I not reaſonably hope, you will endeavour to reform, what you cannot but condemn? Soldiers indeed, are too commonly addicted to ſuch Immoralities; but are they the better Soldiers on that Account? Can an Oath or a Debauch inſpire them with a rational Fortitude againſt the Fears of Death? Would not Prayer and a Life of Holineſs better anſwer this Purpoſe? Their Courage, if they have any, muſt be the Effect, not of Thought, but of the Want of Thought; it muſt be a brutal Stupidity, or Ferocity; but not the rational Courage of a Man or a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>Some of you, I doubt not, are happily free from theſe groſs Vices; and long may you continue ſo! But I muſt tell you, this <hi>negative</hi> Goodneſs is not enough to prepare you for Death, or to conſtitute you true Chriſtians. The Temper of your Minds muſt be changed by the Power of divine Grace; and you muſt be turned from the Love and Practice of all Sin, to the Love and Practice of univerſal Holineſs. You muſt become humble, broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted Penitents, and true Believers in Jeſus Chriſt.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:008333_0020_102F32964B046388"/>You muſt be enabled to live righteouſly, ſoberly, and and godlily, in this preſent evil World. This is Religion: This is Religion that will keep you uncorruped in the midſt of Vice and Debauchery: this is Religion, that will befriend you, when Cannons roar, and Swords gleam around you, and you are every Moment expecting the deadly Wound: this is Religion, that will ſupport you in the Agonies of Death, and aſſure you of a happy Immortality.</p>
            <p>But are not ſome of you conſcious, that you are deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of ſuch a Religion as this? Then it is high Time for you to think on your Condition in ſober Sadneſs. Pray to that powerful and gracious Being, who can form your Hearts and Lives after this ſacred Model. Oh! pray earneſtly, pray frequently for this Bleſſing: and uſe all the Means of Grace in that Manner which your Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances will permit.—Remember alſo, that if you try to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long your Life by a daſtardly Conduct, your Life will lie under the Curſe of Heaven; and you have little Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to hope, you will ever improve it as a Space for Repentance.—Remember alſo to put your Confidence in God; who keeps the Thread of your Life, and the Event of War, in his own Hand. Devoutly acknowledge his Providence in all your Ways, and be ſenſible of your Dependance upon it.</p>
            <p>And now, to conclude my Addreſs to you, as the Mouth of this Multitude, and of your Countrymen in general, I heartily bid you farewel. Farewel, my dear Friends, my brave Fellow-Subjects, the Guardians of your poor ravaged Country. God grant you may return in Safety and Honour, and that we may yet welcome you Home, crowned with Laurels of Victory! Or if any of you ſhould loſe your Lives in ſo good a Cauſe, may you enjoy a glorious and bleſſed Immortality in the Region of everlaſting Peace and Tranquility! Methinks I may take upon me to promiſe you the Prayers and good Wiſhes of Thouſands. Thouſands, whom you leave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, will think of you with affectionate Anxiety, will
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:008333_0021_102F17AEECC931D8"/>wiſh you Succeſs, and congratulate your Return, or lament your Death. Once more I pour out all my Heart in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affectionate Farewel. May the Lord preſerve your Going out, and your Coming in, from this Time forth and even for ever more. Amen.</p>
            <p>Here I thought to have conclued. But I muſt take up a few Minutes more, to aſk this Crowd, is there Nothing to be done by us who ſtay at Home, towards the Defence of our Country, and to promote the Succeſs of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition now in Hand? Shall we ſin on ſtill impenitent and incorrigible? Shall we live as if we and our Country were <hi>ſelf-dependent,</hi> and had Nothing to do with the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Ruler of the Univerſe? Can an Army of <hi>Saints</hi> or of <hi>Heroes</hi> defend an obnoxious People, ripe for Deſtruction from the righteous Judgment of God? The Cauſe in which theſe brave Men, and our Army in general, are engaged, is not ſo much their own as ours. Divine Providence conſiders them not ſo much in their <hi>private</hi> perſonal Character, as in their <hi>publick</hi> Character, as the Repreſentatives, and Guardians of their Country; and therefore they will ſtand or fall, not ſo much according to their own <hi>perſonal</hi> Character, as according to the <hi>publick</hi> Character of the People, whoſe Cauſe they have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken. Be it known to you, then, their Succeſs depends upon us, even more than upon themſelves. Therefore let us all turn every one from his evil Ways. <hi>Let the Wicked forſake his Way, &amp;c.</hi> Let us humble ourſelves under the mighty Hand of God, which is lifted up over our guilty Heads, that we may be exalted in due Time. I could venture the Reputation of my Judgment and Veracity, that it will never be well with our Country, till there be more of the Fear and Love of God in it, and till the Name of Jeſus be of more Importance among us. I could preſcribe a Method for our Deliverance, which is at once infallible, and alſo cheap and ſafe, and ſo far from endangering the Life of any, that it would ſecure the everlaſting Life of all that comply with it.

This will do, what Millions of Money and Thouſands of Men, with Guns and Swords and all the dreadful Artillery of Death, could not do; it will procure us Peace again; a laſting well-eſtabliſhed Peace. We have tried other Expedients without this long enough: Let us now try this new Expedient, the Succeſs of which I dare to warrant.—And do not object, that ſuch a <hi>general</hi> Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is beyond your Power; for a general Reformation muſt begin with <hi>Individuals:</hi> therefore do you, through the Grace of God, do <hi>your</hi> Part; Begin <hi>at Home,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to reform yourſelves, and thoſe under your Inflence.</p>
            <p>It is a natural Inference from what has been ſaid, that if the Defence of our Country, in which we can ſtay but a few Years at moſt, and from which we muſt ere long take our Flight, be ſo important a Duty, then how much more are we obliged to <q>ſeek a better Country, i. e. an heavenly;</q> and to carry on a vigorous War againſt our ſpiritual Enemies, that would rob us of our heavenly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance? Therefore in the Name of JESUS, the Captain of your Salvation, I invite you all to enliſt in the ſpiritual Warfare. Now proclaim eternal War againſt all Sin. Now "take to you the whole Armour of God: quit you like Men, be ſtrong." And for your Encouragement, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>He that overcometh, ſhall inherit all Things:</hi> He ſhall enter into a Kingdom that cannot be <hi>ſhaken</hi>—cannot be ſhaken with thoſe Storms of public Calamities wich toſs and agitate this reſtleſs Ocean of a World. In that bleſſed Harbour may we all reſt at laſt!</p>
