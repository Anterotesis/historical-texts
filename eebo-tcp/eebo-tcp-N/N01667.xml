            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THE <hi>Sermons</hi> Emitted herewith, are very mean, plain, ordinary <hi>Diſcourſes,</hi> like others of the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. They that have Sermons Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by me Fifty Years ago, if they compare them with theſe Compoſures, will find them to be of the ſame ſtrain. I muſt confeſs that I have from my Youth effected a Plain, Scriptural way of Preaching. So have I lived, and ſo let me dye.</p>
                  <p>I have been very much urged, &amp; by many, to Publiſh a conſiderable Number of Diſcourſes on thoſe <hi>Eight Characters of a bleſſed Man</hi> (commonly called the <hi>Beatitudes)</hi> in Christs admirable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon on the Mount. But I muſt Pray my Friends not to be troubled at my not complying with their importunity in that matter; Unleſs ſome One that has the Pen of a ready Writer ſhall tranſcribe Notes taken in ſhort hand (whom I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perſwade to ſpend time in ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable an undertaking) I am not able to do it. Forty Years ago, I could
<pb facs="unknown:001981_0003_0FBA4831F9BFEF80"/>
Preach every Week, and a Monthly Lecture, &amp; Print many Sermons, &amp; ſome other Books which coſt me more Reading &amp; hard Study than the Preaching of many Sermons would have done. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do now as once I could. I find a difference between Forty Years of Age and almoſt Fourſcore. I have cauſe to admire the Mercy of GOD, that at ſuch an Age I am able (by the help of Chriſt) to attend Publick Labours (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' not ſo frequently as in my Youth) in ſo large a Congregation as that where the Divine Providence has cast my lot, &amp; carryed me through more than ſix &amp; fifty Years Temptations &amp; Difficulties. I have great reaſon with thankfulneſs unto Chriſt, to acknowledge the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Love of the Lords People. May I be Serviceable among them whilſt in the World, &amp; leave thoſe things with them, which ſhall be for their Edification, when I ſhall be gone to that World, where of Later Years I have longed to be.</p>

                  <p>IN the beginning of this Chapter, we have the Hiſtory of a Miracle wrought by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in feeding five thouſand Men with only five loaves and two ſmall fiſhes. The Jews were much affected with the Miracle, ſo as that they deſigned to take him by force and make him a King. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he withdrew from them, and privately croſſed the Sea (or Lake) of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> and went over to <hi>Caparnaum.</hi> The next day a great Multitude followed him thither, which
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001981_0005_0FBA48369B43F330"/>
they did not that they were convinced by the Miracles (altho' that was enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them) that he was the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> nor out of any love to his Perſon or to his Doctrine, but out of love to the Loaves. Chriſt reproved them, and exhorted them to mind Earthly things leſs, and Spiritual things more; the Meat which endures to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Life, which he would give them, and not that which periſheth. Wherefore Chriſt Preached an <hi>admirable Sermon,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Bread of Life, that Bread which if a Man eateth of it, he ſhall not die but live for ever. There are eſpecially two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars contained in his Sermon, <hi>viz.</hi> A Declaration what is meant by the Bread of Life, and who they are that eat that Bread. He gives them to underſtand that He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is that Bread, and that Believers are they that eat that Bread. It is by Faith that the Souls of Men feed upon Chriſt, and are made partakers of Eternal Life. This is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by Chriſt in the Words before us, with the greateſt ſolemnity. He pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth it with a double <hi>Verily,</hi> or as it is in the Original, <hi>Amen,</hi> importing the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt certainty. <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi> I ſay unto you, I who am the <hi>Amen,</hi> the faithful and true witneſs, who never did nor can ſpeak an untruth, I ſay unto you, <hi>He that believeth on me hath Everlaſting Life.</hi> If Chriſt is the Bread of Life, and Faith is a feeding on him, it neceſſarily follows, that the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001981_0006_0FBA483809AF1870"/>
ſhall have Everlaſting Life. By Life happineſs is ment. The happy Life is not to be enjoyed in this, but in another World, not Earth, but Heaven is the World where Everlaſting Life is to be had.</p>
                  <p>The Doctrine then before us, is,
<q>
                        <hi>DOCT.</hi> That the True Believer on Jeſus Chriſt ſhall moſt certainly enjoy Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Life and Happineſs in Heaven.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Doctrine may be Opened and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in ſeveral Propoſitions.</p>
                  <p>PROP. I. <hi>In Faith there is implyed an</hi> Aſſent <hi>of the Understanding to the Truth of the Goſpel, and a</hi> Conſent <hi>of the Will to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Chriſt as offered in the Goſpel.</hi> This I take to be a true and a clear deſcription of Faith. It is the Soul that Believeth and cloſeth with Chriſt. Lam. 3.24. <hi>The Lord is my portion ſaith my ſoul.</hi> The <hi>Soul</hi> is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten called the <hi>Heart</hi> in the Scripture, Rom. 10.10. <hi>With the heart man believeth unto righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi> Then both the Underſtanding and the Will of the Believer are given to Chriſt, theſe being the two eſſential faculties of a Reaſonable Soul.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Faith implies a work of God on the Underſtanding inlightning it, and cauſing an <hi>Aſſent</hi> to the great Truths of the Goſpel. It implies a giving Credit to divine Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001981_0007_0FBA48408E879EA8"/>
It is expreſſed in the Scripture by a <hi>full aſſurance of Underſtanding,</hi> Col. 2.2. The Believer does not only think that the myſtery of the Goſpel is Truth, but He is ſure of it. Hence <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaking in the Name of all true Believers, ſayes, <hi>We believe and are ſure that thou art that Chriſt the Son of the living God,</hi> Joh. 6.69. There muſt be Knowledge in the <hi>Head</hi> or there will not be Faith in the <hi>Heart.</hi> No Man will believe in an Unknown Chriſt. Joh. 10.38. <hi>That you may know and believe.</hi> Yea, Knowledge is ſo Eſſential to Faith, as that Faith is ſometimes called Knowledge, Iſai. 53.11. <hi>By his Knowledge. i. e.</hi> by the knowledge of him, <hi>my righteous Servant:</hi> it is Chriſt the Righteous, who is there called Gods righteous Servant, <hi>ſhall juſtify many.</hi> It is by Faith that many are juſtified. In ſpecial the Believer giveth a full <hi>Aſſent</hi> to that great Truth of the Goſpel, that the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is come, and that our <hi>Jeſus</hi> is He. Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Martha,</hi> who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever liveth, and believeth in me ſhall never die: Believeſt thou this? She ſaid unto him, yea, Lord, <hi>I believe, that thou art the Christ, the Son of God that ſhould come into the World,</hi> Joh. 11.27. He believeth what the Goſpel reveals concerning the Perſon of Chriſt: That he is God and not Man only, but God and Man in One Perſon. And he believes the Truth relating to the Office of Chriſt, that there is One <hi>Mediator</hi> between God and Man, the Man Chriſt Jeſus: And the Truth
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001981_0008_0FBA484295AEA8C0"/>
which concern Chriſts State of Humiliation and Exaltation. That he dyed, and was made a Sacrifice for the Sins of his People, and roſe again the third day, and is aſcended to Heaven, and is at the right hand of God, Angels being made ſubject to him, and will come again at the laſt day to Judge the World. That Man that does disbelieve or deny any one fundamental Article of the Chriſtian Religion, cannot be a true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver on Chriſt. But altho' the Faith of <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> is neceſſary, it is not alone a Saving Faith. For many Hypocrites and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates have it. There were chief Rulers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews of whom it is ſaid that they believed, but they did not confeſs their Faith, <hi>For they loved the praiſe of men more than the praiſe of God,</hi> Joh. 12.42, 43. That decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them to be no true Believers. For there is not a true Believer in the World that loves the praiſe of Men (though they may love it too much) more than the praiſe of God. Moreover, their declining to make a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſt, diſcovered their want of a Saving Faith. For with the heart Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth, and <hi>with the Mouth Confeſſion is made to Salvation.</hi> If a Man will not <hi>Confeſs</hi> Chriſt before all the World, that's a ſure ſign that his heart doth not truly believe on him. Believers in the Primitive times would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly Confeſs the Name of Chriſt, when they knew they ſhould die for it immediately. It is related concerning one of the Martyrs,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001981_0009_0FBA4844186F66D0"/>
That the Perſecutors could obtain no Anſwer to their Interrogatives, but <hi>I am a Chriſtian.</hi> Where doeſt thou live? <hi>I am a Chriſtian.</hi> Who are thy Relations? <hi>I am -a Chriſtian.</hi> It is not neceſſary to Salvation, that a Man ſhould ſay, I am <hi>Lutheran,</hi> or I am a <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaniſt,</hi> or I am an <hi>Epiſcopalian,</hi> or I a <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beterian</hi>; or of this or that Party: but it is neceſſary that he ſhould ſay, and confeſs it freely, <hi>I am a Chriſtian.</hi> Since then, ſome that have been convinced of Chriſts being the Son of God, yet have not confeſſed him, that ſhews that a meer doctrinal Faith is not a Saving Faith. Nay, ſuch a Faith is no more than what the Devils and Damned have. To thoſe that have only a Faith of Aſſent, the Apoſtle ſays, Jam. 2.19. <hi>Thou believest there is one God, thou doſt well, The Devils alſo believe and tremble.</hi> All Religion depends upon this Article of it, <hi>There is a GOD, and but One GOD.</hi> Deny that and you deſtroy all Religion at once. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when it is ſaid, The Devils believe there is One God, it imports that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all the Articles of Religion. In par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular they believe that Great Article of our Chriſtian Faith, That Jeſus of Nazareth is the Son of God whom he had promiſed to ſend into the World. We read in the Goſpel of a Poſſeſſed Man, that when the Devils in him ſaw Chriſt, they made a ſad out cry, <hi>Saying, Let us alone, what have we to do with thee, thou Jeſus of Nazareth, are
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001981_0010_0FBA48465AE75C10"/>
thou come to deſtroy us? I know thee who thou art, the holy One of God.</hi> So that this Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief is not enough to denominate any One a true Believer in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In Faith there is implied the <hi>Conſent</hi> of the Will. Believers are Chriſts People. And his People are a <hi>Willing People,</hi> Pſal. 110.3. In this does Believing eſpecially conſiſt. Hence Faith is ſaid to be not a believing <hi>Of</hi> Chriſt, but a Believing <hi>On</hi> him. So in the Text before us. And Believing <hi>In</hi> him, Joh. 11.25. <hi>He that believeth</hi> in <hi>me though he were dead, yet ſhall he live.</hi> And there are many other Expreſſions whereby Faith is denoted in the Scripture which imply a <hi>Conſent of the Will.</hi> e. g. It is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed by a willingneſs to come to Chriſt for Life and Salvation. Chriſt ſaid to the unbelieving Jews, <hi>You will not come to me that you might have life,</hi> Joh. 5.40. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief is a <hi>departing</hi> from Chriſt. So 'tis by Faith that we go to him for Salvation. When ſome falſe hearted Diſciples were ſo offended at ſome paſſages in Chriſts Sermon, as to go back and walk no more with him, Chriſt ſaid to his true Diſciples, Will you alſo go away? <hi>Peter</hi> anſwered, <hi>Lord to whom ſhall we go, Thou haſt the words of Eternal Life,</hi> Joh. 6.68. Thy words which teach us to believe on thee will bring us to Eternal Life, therefore we will go to thee and to no one elſe for it. Faith is
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001981_0011_0FBA484899AEF380"/>
expreſſed by that of <hi>Truſting</hi> in the Lord, in which is implied a <hi>Conſent of the Will,</hi> and a <hi>Resting</hi> on him, and a <hi>Leaning</hi> on him. Cant. 8.5. <hi>Who is this that comes up from the Wilderneſs Leaning on her beloved.</hi> It is the Believer that comes out of the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this World, and Leans upon Chriſt all the Way in his Journey towards Heaven. Again, Faith is called Obedience. <hi>He is the Author of Salvation to all that obey him,</hi> Heb. 5.9. It is not a forced but a willing Obedience. Iſai. 1.19. <hi>If ye be willing and obedient, you ſhall eat the good of the Land.</hi> They that are willingly obedient to Chriſt ſhall eat the good of the heavenly Land, they ſhall eat the bread of Life there. Moreover, <hi>Believing</hi> is ſaid to be a <hi>Receiving of Chriſt.</hi> Joh. 1.12. <hi>As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe on his Name.</hi> A Man that has a gift offered to him, if he is convinced of the worth of it, he receives it with both hands willingly. Chriſt is the greateſt gift that poſſibly can be. God himſelf has not a greater gift to beſtow than that of his Son Jeſus Chriſt. In the Goſpel he offers him to Sinners to be their Saviour. They that <hi>Receive</hi> him as God offers him, are the Believers that ſhall have Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life. The true Believer <hi>Receives</hi> him <hi>with</hi> his heart, and in his heart. Chriſt ſayes, <hi>Behold I stand at the door and knock, if any man hear my voice, and open the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001981_0012_0FBA484B4DA0A9A8"/>
door, I will come in to him and will ſup with him and he with me,</hi> Rev. 3.20. What door is that which Chriſt ſtands knocking at? It is at the door of the Sinners heart. Chriſt ſays, Open that door, that I may come in. The Believer ſays, I will do it with all my heart. Come in bleſſed Lord, Take poſſeſſion of this heart of mine, Dwell there and rule there for ever; And caſt out of my heart what ever ſtands in oppoſition to thee. I give to thee, and to none but thee my heart. The Believer that thus heartily receives Chriſt, ſhall ſup with him, ſhall feaſt with him upon the bread of Life in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>To ſpeak more particularly:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Believer receives Chriſt in his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as a moſt deſirable One. 1 Pet. 2.7. <hi>To you which believe he is precious.</hi> Not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his benefits precious, but He himſelf is ſo. God offers his Son to Men to be their Head and Saviour, that their Souls ſhould be Married to him, Matth. 22.2. <hi>A King made a Marriage for his Son.</hi> The God of Heaven is the King there ſpoken of. Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is his Son. It is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Soul that is Married to him; yea, the Soul takes him not meerly for his Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but for the excellency and deſirable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Perſon. Not for his Loaves, but becauſe his Miracles have convinced him
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001981_0013_0FBA484D6636E9C8"/>
that he is the Son of God, and ſo the moſt excellent Perſon that ever was in the World. The dark Unbeliever never had his eyes opened ſo as to have real viſions of the glory of Chriſt. The language of Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief is that, in Iſai. 53.2. <hi>He has no form nor comlineſs, and when we ſhall ſee him, there is no beauty in him that we ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him.</hi> But as for the true Believer the Spirit of God has opened his eyes, and ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into his heart, and has given him to ſee the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt. He therefore ſayes of Chriſt, He is my beloved, and my beloved is the chief of ten thouſand. There is no Man on Earth nor in Heaven neither that is ſo deſirable in his eyes as Jeſus Chriſt. Pſal. 73.25. <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee, and there is none upon Earth that I deſire beſides thee.</hi> He does then moſt willingly receive him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He receives Chriſt, as in his Perſon, ſo in all his Offices. He does not only believe that Chriſt is a Prieſt, a Prophet and King, but is willing that Chriſt ſhould be his Prieſt, his Prophet, and his King. It is true that the Prieſtly Office of Chriſt is in a ſpecial manner the object of Faith. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>. 3.25 <hi>Whom God hath ſet forth to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation through faith in his blood.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt the glorious <hi>High Prieſt of our</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> has offered a Sacrifice to God to make Atonement for the Sins of

his People, and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> to obtain for them the forgiveneſs of all their Sins, and the Salvation of their Souls. Now that Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice which Chriſt has offered, is Himſelf. He is both Prieſt and Sacrifice. His hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature which was Sacrificed being Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally united to the divine Nature, that Sacrifice was infinitely greater than if all the Creatures in the whole World had been a Sacrifice to appeaſe the wrath and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Juſtice of God, for the wrong done to him by the Sins of Men. It was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to make Atonement for the Sins of the whole World. Were it not for the Merit of the blood of that Sacrifice, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever would have no Faith nor Hope of ever ſeeing Heaven. Heb. 10.19. <hi>Having boldneſs to enter into the holiest of all by the blood of Jeſus.</hi> He dare venture to ſay, If there is not Merit enough in the blood of Jeſus to obtain my Salvation, I am content to periſh. But ſince there is ſuch a great High Prieſt as <hi>Jeſus the Son of God</hi> to be his Saviour, the true Believer on him ſhall never periſh. Thus does he receive Chriſt in his Prieſtly Office. He alſo receives and ſubmits unto him in his Prophetical Office. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid to the Children of Iſrael, <hi>A Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet will the Lord your God raiſe up unto you like unto me, him ſhall you hear in all things whatſoever he ſhall ſay unto you, and it ſhall come to paſs that every ſoul that will not hear that Prophet ſhall be destroyed.</hi> Chriſt
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001981_0015_0FBA4854D808BD90"/>
is that Prophet, as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> declares in one of his Sermons which he Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Temple, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.22. The <hi>Believer</hi> is called a <hi>Comer</hi> to Chriſt: Joh. 6.35. <hi>He that comes to me ſhall never hunger, he that believeth on me ſhall never thirst.</hi> He comes to Chriſt to be taught by him, as a Scholar comes to his Inſtructor. Hence Believers are called <hi>Diſciples.</hi> Again, the Believer receives Chriſt as King. There are many that would have Chriſt to be their Saviour who are not willing that he ſhould be their Ruler, But Believers ſay of Chriſt, <hi>He is our Lawgiver, he is our King, he will ſave us.</hi> As ſuch He is received by the true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever. Col. 2.6. <hi>As you have received Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, ſo walk ye in him.</hi> It was from damning Unbelief in the Jews that they ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>We will not have this man to raign over us,</hi> Luke 19.14.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The true Believer is willing to receive Chriſt upon Chriſts own Terms. He will not capitulate with Chirſt, and ſay, I will be his Servant, provided ſo and ſo: but he ſayes, Let Chriſt propoſe what terms he pleaſeth, by the help of his Grace I'le comply and be his Servant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But what are the Terms which we muſt Conſent unto, and comply with, if we would have Chriſt to be our Saviour? What does the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="unknown:001981_0016_0FBA485813B58070"/>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If we would have Chriſt to be our Saviour, we muſt have no other Saviour. As there is no other, nor any in Heaven or Earth that is fit to be the Saviour of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing World, but only Jeſus Chriſt. Act. 4.12. <hi>There is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be ſaved.</hi> So we may not expect Salvation in whole or in part from any other. Chriſt ſayes to the Man that would approve himſelf a Believer, <hi>Thou ſhalt be for me and not for another,</hi> Hoſ. 3 3. <hi>David</hi> was a true Believer on Chriſt. He ſayes, <hi>My ſoul wait thou only upon God, my Expectation is from him, he only is my rock and my ſalvation,</hi> Pſal. 62.5, 6. The Believer has no other Prieſt by the Merit of whoſe Sacrifice he Expects reconciliation with God, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life. He does not think to be Saved partly by the Merit of Chriſts Obedience, and partly by his own. When there were ſome among the <hi>Galatians</hi> that would be Saved partly by <hi>Moſes</hi> and partly by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle declares to them, that if they did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue of that Opinion, <hi>Chriſt would profit them nothing,</hi> Gal. 5.2. Nor has the true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any other Prophet to whom he yields abſolute and univerſal Obedience, but only Jeſus Chriſt. The Jewiſh <hi>Rabbies</hi> expected that their diſciples ſhould believe whatever they dictated, as if they had been infallible, which is an Obedience due to Chriſt alone. In oppoſition to them, it is ſaid, <hi>Neither be ye called Masters, for one is your Maſter even
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001981_0017_0FBA48590EBFAA50"/>
Chriſt,</hi> Matth. 23.10. Moreover, The Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever receives Chriſt as his King, and the only King of his Soul. Before he had Faith, he ſubmitted his Soul to another King. Sin reigned in him, and Satan ruled over him, but now he ſayes, <hi>Other Lords have had domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over me,</hi> for the future I will make mention of <hi>thy Name only,</hi> Iſai. 26.13. True Believers all agree in <hi>appointing themſelves one head,</hi> Hoſ. 1.11. That one head is none but Chriſt. <hi>Nathaniel</hi> ſaid to him, <hi>Thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Iſrael,</hi> Joh. 1.49. He is not only <hi>a</hi> King of Iſrael, but <hi>the</hi> King of Iſrael. There is no other King of Iſrael, (that is of the Church of God,) but only the Son of God. The Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever receives him accordingly.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is required of Men that they ſhould deny themſelves, and receive Chriſt with his Croſs, if they would indeed approve themſelves Believers on Chriſt. Men are apt to ſay as thoſe Jews did; Matth. 27.42. <hi>Let him come down from the croſs, and we will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him.</hi> But a Man cannot be a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> if he will not be a <hi>Croſs-bearer.</hi> How expreſs and plain are the words of Chriſt, Matth. 16.24. <hi>If any man will come after me,</hi> if he will be my diſciple, <hi>Let him deny himſelf, and take up his croſs and follow me.</hi> If a Man will be my diſciple (ſayes Chriſt) he muſt follow my Example in bearing the Croſs as I ſhall do: He muſt go croſs to his own
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001981_0018_0FBA485AAB2DE4E0"/>
Will, and natural inclination. So muſt he deny himſelf. <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Self</hi> are very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. And what ſelf muſt he deny? Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſelf muſt be denyed: which to do is a great difficulty. For nothing is more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to Adams Children, than to deſire to be Saved by ſome works or righteouſneſs of their own, and not be beholden to another, to Chriſt for all their Salvation. They would <hi>find the life of their hands.</hi> The Jews when Chriſt was at <hi>Capernaum,</hi> enquired of him, <hi>What ſhall we do that we might work the works of God?</hi> Meaning the work which God will reward with Eternal Life. Chriſt gives them to underſtand that Everlaſting Life follows not upon <hi>Doing,</hi> but upon <hi>Believing</hi>: Joh. 6.29. <hi>This is the work of God that you believe on him whom he hath ſent.</hi> For a Man to make many Prayers, and to remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy, to be righteous in all his dealings with Men, and to abound in works of Charity, and when he has done to look upon all as nothing worth, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend wholly on the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt for all his acceptance with God, is ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial. Thus <hi>Humbled</hi> muſt a Man be, that ſo he may be a true Believer on Chriſt. He muſt renounce all his own righteouſneſs and eſteem it as filthy rags. So did <hi>Paul: He counted all things but loſs for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ: and that he might be found in him not having his own righteouſneſs, but that which is through the Faith of Chriſt,</hi>
                     <pb n="16" facs="unknown:001981_0019_0FBA485CCE904580"/>
Phil. 3.8, 9. Alſo, corrupt ſinful ſelf muſt be denyed. A Man muſt be willing to part with his Sins, and the Luſts of his heart ſo far as they are ſinful, or he cannot be a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever on Chriſt. Joh. 5.44. <hi>How can you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve which receive honour one of another?</hi> If a Man is under the dominion of a Luſt of Ambition, how can he believe? So if he is under the power of a Luſt of Wantonneſs, or a Luſt of Drunkenneſs, or of any other Luſt, that he will rather venture the loſs of his Soul, and Eternal Life, than part with that Sin, how can he believe. The true Believer is heartily willing to part with all his Sins. It is ſaid of the wiſe Merchant, that <hi>he ſold all that he had for the Pearl of great price,</hi> Matth. 13.46. Chriſt is the Pearl of great price, the true Believer is the wiſe Merchant, he will <hi>ſell all,</hi> will part with all the World, much more with all his Sins, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than not have Chriſt and Eternal Life. That Sin which has been his <hi>own Iniquity,</hi> as hard to part with as his right hand, he will cut it off, if it will keep him from having an Intereſt in Chriſt. That Sin which has been the chief Idol of his heart, he is willing to part with it. Hoſ. 14.8. <hi>Ephraim ſhall ſay, what have I to do any more with Idols.</hi> Converted Ephraim ſhall ſay ſo. Ephraim, when became a believer on Chriſt, ſhall ſay ſo, and will ſay ſo. Moreover<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Natural Self</hi> ſo far as ſtanding in oppoſition to, or competition with Jeſus Chriſt, it
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001981_0020_0FBA485E9DB214D0"/>
muſt be denyed. A Man muſt break with his deareſt Friends, or neareſt Relations, rather than break with Chriſt, or he will not, nay, he cannot be a Believer. Luke 14.26. <hi>If any man come to me and hate not his Father and Mother, and Wife and Children, yea, and his own Life, he cannot be my diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> A leſs degree of love is called hatred in the Scripture. The caſe may be ſo circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced with a Man, that if he become a Chriſtian, his own Father, or his own Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will become his Enemy, and ſeek his Life. It has often been ſo. Nothing is ſo dear to Men naturally as Life. All that a Man has will he give for his Life: but if he does not hate his own Life in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt, he cannot be a true Believer on his Name. The Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>I am ready not only to be bound, but to die for the Name of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> Act. 21.13. In the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Times, Chriſtians were frequently put upon the Trial, Whether they would part with their Lives for the Name of Chriſt, then many falſe-hearted Chriſtians proved Apoſtates, but the <hi>ſound Believer</hi> did not ſo. Rev. 12.11. <hi>They loved not their lives to the death.</hi> They might have lived and enjoyed the Comforts of Life many a fair day, if they would have denied Chriſt, but they choſe death rather. And in theſe Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ages, cruel and bloody Papiſts would burn the Servants of Chriſt to death, if they did not own Antichriſt, and ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001981_0021_0FBA48603AE1C2D0"/>
Chriſt. Notable was the Expreſſion of One of thoſe Martyrs. <hi>If I had as many lives as there are hairs on my head, I would gladly part with them all for Chriſt.</hi> But thus we ſee that if Men will be Chriſtians indeed, they muſt take Chriſt with his Croſs. This has been the parting point between Chriſt, and many a one that has bid fair for Chriſt and Heaven. We have diverſe Inſtances of it in the Goſpel. There was a Perſon of ſome Note, one that was a <hi>Scribe.</hi> Among the Jews the <hi>Scribes</hi> were Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Officers, not unlike thoſe who among Chriſtians are called <hi>the Canoniſts.</hi> A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Scribe came to our Saviour and ſaid, <hi>I will follow thee, whitherſoover thou goeſt,</hi> Matth. 8.19. No doubt but notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this fair profeſſion, he hoped for ſome Secular advantage by following Chriſt; for when the Lord intimated to him, That if he would be his Diſciple, it may be he might be a poor Man all the days of his Life; ſo poor as not to have an houſe to lay his head in, we then hear no more of his following Chriſt. There was alſo a Ruler among the Jews, who was a Man of a great Eſtate. He was very deſirous of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life in Heaven. He came kneeling to Chriſt, and asked him, <hi>What ſhall I do that I may inherit Eternal Life.</hi> To try what he would do, the Lord ſaid to him, <hi>Sell whatſoever thou haſt and give to the poor, take up the croſs and follow me, and thou ſhalt have trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001981_0022_0FBA48615157D990"/>
in heaven: He was ſad at that ſaying, and went away grieved, for he had great Poſſeſſions,</hi> Mark 10.<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>1, 22. There are many who if they could have Chriſt and the World too, they would be Chriſtians, but when they hear of ſuch hard termes as taking up the Croſs, and parting with all the World for Chriſt, they go away ſorrowful. Men deal with Chriſt as <hi>Orpah</hi> did by her impoveriſhed Mother <hi>Naomi,</hi> when ſhe was told that ſhe muſt expect nothing of the Worlds good, by going with her, She wept and took her leave of her. Thus do many weep over Chriſt, and weep over Religion, and take their leave of it. But the true Believer, does like <hi>Ruth,</hi> who ſaid, Thy People ſhall be my People, and thy God ſhall be my God; nought but death ſhall part thee and me. So ſays the Believer, nought but death ſhall part Chriſt and me, neither ſhall that do it. Thus I have ſpent a whole Sermon, in declaring to you what it is to be a Believer.</p>

It is ſaid of the Believer that he ſhall <hi>Eat of the Tree of Life which is in the midſt of the Paradiſe of God,</hi> Rev. 2.7. If Adam had Eat of the Tree of Life, he ſhould have lived for ever. So ſhall the Believer who does by Faith feed upon Chriſt, who is the Tree of Life.</p>
                     <p>Several things may be mentioned which Evince &amp; Confirm the Truth now before us.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>True Faith in Chriſt is an infallible ſign of Electing Grace.</hi> The Electing Love of God is Unchangable. The purpoſe of God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Election ſtands firm for ever, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11. Among the Jews there were a great many who did not obtain Eternal Life: but <hi>the Election hath obtained it,</hi> Rom. 11.7. Not One Elect Soul ſhall ever periſh. For they are all given to Chriſt, to be Redeemed and Saved by him. And he has ſaid to God his
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001981_0024_0FBA4866995EFEC0"/>
Father, <hi>Thoſe whom thou gaveſt me I have kept, and none of them is lost,</hi> Joh. 17.12. It is impoſſible that any one of Gods Elect ſhould periſh. Satan and his Inſtruments may do their utmoſt to draw them from Chriſt, and ſo to hinder their Salvation, but in vain. Tis ſaid, <hi>They ſhall deceive the very Elect if it were poſſible,</hi> Matth. 24.24. which words imply that it is impoſſible. But Believers on the Name of Chriſt are Elected. It is true that there are many belonging to Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on who do not as yet believe, but they ſhall believe. Wherefore Chriſt has ſaid, <hi>I have other Sheep who are not of this fold, them alſo I muſt bring, and they ſhall hear my voice,</hi> Joh. 10.16. Thoſe whom God has from Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty choſen to Salvation, ſhall believe, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. And they that do believe may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by know that they are choſen to Salvation. For which cauſe the Apoſtle exhorts Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that they ſhould <hi>give diligence to make their Calling and Election ſure,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.10. Not that they ſhould endeavour to make their Election in it ſelf ſure, for ſo it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the World began; but ſure in reſpect of their own Knowledge of it. Effectual Calling, or Obedience to the call of the Goſpel is the ſame thing with Faith. He that has Aſſurance of that, has Aſſurance of his Election, and ſo of his being an Heir of Everlaſting Life.</p>

                        <pb n="22" facs="unknown:001981_0025_0FBA486B54BAEE38"/>2. <hi>The Son of God came into the World that ſo whoever ſhall truly believe on him might have Everlaſting Life.</hi> He came to deliver from death. 1 Joh. 3 8. <hi>For this purpoſe the Son of God was manifested, that he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the works of the Devil.</hi> Sin and Death were the works of the Devil. All that the Devil had been contriving &amp; doing againſt the Elect, the Son of God came into the World, and deſtroyed all the Devils de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in one day. The Devil drew Adam the firſt Man into ſin, and that ſin killed all his Children: but Chriſt the Second Adam has delivered his Children from Eternal Death. 1 Cor. 15.22. <hi>For as in Adam all die, even ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive.</hi> This was Gods bleſſed deſign in ſending Chriſt into the World: 1 Joh. 4.9. <hi>He ſent his only begotten Son into the World, that we might live through him.</hi> And this was Chriſts end in coming, that ſo he might obtain a better Life for Believers than ever <hi>Adam</hi> had, before ſin entred into the World. Joh. 10.10. <hi>I am come that you might have life, and that you might have it more abundantly.</hi> Chriſt did therefore himſelf dye. The ſorrows of Hell took hold on him. He endured the pains both of the firſt death in his holy Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and of the ſecond death, when his Soul was made an offering for ſin, that ſo he might redeem us from death. If then Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers ſhould not have everlaſting Life, Chriſt has dyed in vain, the end of his
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001981_0026_0FBA486C930293C0"/>
coming into the World ſhould be fruſtrated, which is a thing not to be ſuppoſed.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>The faithful God has promiſed that Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſhall have Everlasting Life.</hi> 1 Joh. 2.25. <hi>This is the promiſe that he hath promiſed us Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life.</hi> Believers are for the generality among the poor of the World, but in reſpect of the heavenly World, they are rich. There the riches of a Kingdom is their's, and a far more glorious Kingdom than any on the Earth. This riches they have in reverſion by vertue of a faithful promiſe made to them. Jam. 2.5. <hi>Hath not God choſen the poor of the world, rich in faith, and heirs of the Kingdom, which he hath promiſed to them that love him.</hi> That Kingdom is the ſame thing with Everlaſting Life. It is called <hi>the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> Heb. 10.36. That after you have done the will of God you may <hi>receive the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</hi> What is that promiſe but Life and Glory in Heaven?

                     <head>PROPOSITION, III. The true Believer on Jeſus Christ is as ſure to have Everlaſting Life given to him, as if he was now in the actual and full En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of it.</head>
                     <p>Hence it is Expreſſed in the preſent Tenſe, he <hi>hath,</hi> and not <hi>he ſhall have</hi> (though that's intended) Everlaſting Life. In the Scripture things future are ſometimes ſpoken of as if they were preſent, intimating the undoubted certainty of their accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Thus, Iſai. 9.1. <hi>For unto us a Child is born.</hi> The Prophet wrote thoſe words above ſeven hundred Years, before that Child was born, but it was as ſure to be as if it had been already. So is the Believers Enjoyment of Eternal Life in Heaven. He <hi>now hath</hi> Everlaſting Life,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>In that he</hi> now hath <hi>an Intereſt in Chriſt.</hi> 1 Joh. 5.12. <hi>He that hath the Son hath Life.</hi> The Believer <hi>Now hath</hi> the Son. He is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to Chriſt: As the branch is united to the vine, and one with it. Chriſt is the vine, Believers are branches in that vine: As the branches are part of the body of the vine, ſo is every Believer a part of Chriſts Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal body. The Myſtical Union between Chriſt and the Believer is like the Natural Union which is between the head and the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:001981_0029_0FBA487347500648"/>
body. Believers on Earth in reſpect of their bleſſed head are in heaven already. God <hi>hath made them to ſit in heavenly Places in Christ Jeſus,</hi> Eph. 2.6. They are as ſure to be with Chriſt in Heaven, as if they were there <hi>Now.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>The Believer is</hi> Now <hi>in a State of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and without fault before the Throne of God.</hi> Rom. 8.1. <hi>There is now no condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to them that are in Christ Jeſus.</hi> There <hi>was</hi> Condemnation to them, but <hi>now</hi> there is none at all. It is not only true that a Sentance of Abſolution ſhall be paſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him before all the World at the Day of Judgment, his Sins ſhall be blotted out, when the time of refreſhing ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord, but its alſo done already, then he ſhall live and not die. It was ſaid to <hi>David, The Lord hath put away thy ſin thou ſhalt not dye.</hi> So may it be ſaid to the true Believer on Jeſus Chriſt, the Lord has pardoned thy Sin, thou ſhalt not die, but live for ever. The Scripture ſays, That <hi>whom he Juſtified them he glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,</hi> Rom. 8.30. Two things are impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Juſtification, in reſpect whereof the Believer on Jeſus Chriſt <hi>has</hi> Eternal Life. One is the full forgiveneſs of Sin. Where there is no Sin, there is no Death. The Juſtified Perſon is fully and for ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted from his Sins. All his Sins are done away in the blood of Chriſt: That
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:001981_0030_0FBA48784CCBE100"/>
blood having been ſprinkled on his Soul, he is perfectly cleanſed from the guilt of his Sins. Pſal. 51.7. <hi>Purge me with Hyſop,</hi> (when blood was ſprinkled with Hyſop on the Leper he was cleanſed from his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſy,) <hi>and I ſhall be clean: Waſh me and I ſhall be whiter than the ſnow.</hi> It is for the ſake of Chriſts blood in which he has been waſhed, that the Pardoned Believer is looked upon as Sinleſs and Guiltleſs. Jer. 50.20. <hi>The iniquity of Iſrael ſhall be ſought for, and there ſhall be none, and the ſins of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, and they ſhall not be found, for I will pardon them whom I reſerve</hi> Moreover, the Believers Juſtification implies his being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted as righteous: He may plead a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect righteouſneſs for his obtaining Eternal Life. Chriſts righteouſneſs is perfect: He has ſatisfyed the Law and fulfilled the Law by his Active and Paſſive Obedience, which is imputed to every true Believer. <hi>The Righteouſneſs of God,</hi> cannot but be perfect Righteouſneſs, this is <hi>upon all them that do believe,</hi> Rom. 3.22. Then Everlaſting Life is their's.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>The Believer has Everlaſting Life, in reſpect of a Juſt Title to it.</hi> It does <hi>Now</hi> of right belong to him. Rev. 22.14. <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are they that do his Commandments, that they may have right to the tree of Life.</hi> A Man may have a juſt Title to that Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which he has not a preſent poſſeſſion

of. The Believer has a right to the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of Eternal Life on the account of a glorious purchaſe. It has been bought and paid for. Not by himſelf. Eternal Life is too great a thing for all the Creatures in the World ever to purchaſe or lay down a valuable price for it. But Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God has given an Infinite price to purchaſe it for the Believer on his Name. He has <hi>Merited</hi> it for them.

If there is no other World but this, why would he deſire to dye the Death of the Righteous rather than of the wicked? For as to what is viſible as the one dies, ſo dies the other; but he was convinced that when a Righteous Man dies his Soul goes to a better World, but when a wicked Man dies, his Soul goes to a woful World, his knowledge of that made him ſay, <hi>O let me dye the death of the Righteous.</hi> There is a viſible World, which with the things belonging to it are Temporal, there is alſo an inviſible World, and the things there are Eternal. So ſayes the Scripture, 2 Cor. 4.18. <hi>The things which are ſeen are Temporal, but the things which are not ſeen are Eternal.</hi> There is <hi>this preſent World,</hi> that's Temporal. This World ſhan't continue always in its preſent State. 1 Cor. 7.31. <hi>The faſhion of this World paſſeth away.</hi> The Earth and the works therein ſhall be burnt up; All theſe things ſhall be diſſolved. <hi>Life</hi> in this World is <hi>Temporal.</hi> There is no Creature on the Earth whoſe Life is Everlaſting.

The <hi>Reſurrection World,</hi> is a World to come. They that obtain that World are Immortal ones, <hi>Neither can they dye any more,</hi> Luke 20.30. The <hi>Heavenly World,</hi> is a <hi>World to come</hi> as to our Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it.

Pſal. 16.11. <hi>Thou wilt ſhew me the path of life, in thy preſence is fulneſs of joy, and at thy right hand are pleaſures for ever more.</hi> And as there is an Eternal Heaven, where the Righteous ſhall be rewarded with Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life, So there is an Everlaſting Hell, where the wicked ſhall be puniſhed with Eternal death and miſery. Mark 9.43. <hi>In Hell the worm dyeth not, and the fire never ſhall be quenched.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt has taught us the doctrine of the Immortality of the Souls of Men. He has ſaid, <hi>Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the Soul,</hi> Matth. 10.28. Its an eaſy matter to kill the body, a little thing will do it, but all the Men in the World are not able to kill the Soul, which is of ſuch a nature that it <hi>cannot be killed.</hi> Now if the Souls of Men are Immortal, it neceſſarily follows, that
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:001981_0034_0FBA4881451FFF18"/>
they will be either happy or miſerable to Eternity. Moreover, that which the Apoſtle ſpeaks, is a clear demonſtration that there is another World, and another Life beſides this. 1 Cor. 15.19. <hi>If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men moſt miſerable.</hi> Chriſtians deny themſelves of the Comforts of this Life, and expoſe themſelves to many croſſes and ſorrows, and all for Chriſts ſake; if then there were not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, and another Life after this, the beſt Men in the World, would be the unhappieſt, which is againſt the light of reaſon to imagine. There was a Chriſtian Emperor, that when ſome informed him of the Death of a Noble Man, withal declaring that he was a very wicked Man, and yet lived to a great old Age, and never met with any affliction in his Life, then (ſaid the Emperor) we may conclude that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of God ſpeak the Truth unto us, when they tell us, that there is another World beſides this, and a Judgment to come. And wiſe Men among the Gentiles have argued thus, we ſee (ſay they) That many Times in this World Virtue is not rewarded, and Vice is not puniſhed, Therefore there muſt needs be a future World and State, in which Men ſhall receive according to what their deeds have been.</p>
                     <p>All this notwithſtanding there have been ſome who paſs under the Name of Chriſtians,

One fitly calls them <hi>Baptized Infidels,</hi> who deny all <hi>revealed Religion,</hi> and will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any thing, but what they ſee with their eyes. One of them when dying ſaid, <hi>He was going to take a Leap in the dark,</hi> He Queſtioned whether there was either a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or an Hell. And it has been credibly reported that a dying Pope, ſaid, That now he ſhould be reſolved of three great Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, 1. Whether there is a God or no. 2. Whether there is a Heaven or an Hell. 3. Whether the Souls of Men are Immortal. But altho' there are few Comparatively which are arrived to ſuch a prodigious height of Atheiſm and Infidelity, there are Practical Infidels innumerable. What ſhall be ſaid of <hi>Worldlings,</hi> Men of the World whoſe portion is in this Life, nor are they at all ſollicitous about any other Life or Portion, beſides what is Enjoyed on the Earth. Do not Men live as if all their thoughts were that there is no God, nor E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life to come? If they did really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that there is no other World but this, would they not live juſt as now they do? Do they not practically ſay, <hi>Let us eat and drink for to morrow we ſhall dye.</hi> If there is no Eternal World, no Everlaſting Life, they may well ſay ſo. Did not the holy Apoſtle weep when he knew that there was among Profeſſed Chriſtians many whoſe God is their belly, their glory is their ſhame, <hi>who mind Earthly things,</hi> Phil. 3.19.</p>

But in reſpect of Chriſt it was ſaid, <hi>Behold a greater than Solomon is here.</hi> The Jewiſh Writers have a ſaying (and there is truth in it) That <hi>when Meſſiah comes, he ſhall be greater than Moſes, greater than our Father Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, greater than the Angels.</hi> The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſayes no leſs: <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.4, 5. Being made ſo much better than the Angels, he has by inheritance <hi>obtained a more excellent Name than they, for unto which of the Angels ſaid he at any time, Thou art my Son.</hi> God has ſet the Man Chriſt Jeſus at his own right hand in Heaven, which is a dignity above the higheſt Angel in Heaven.

higheſt <hi>Arch Angel</hi> is his Servant, and will appear to be ſo before all the World, when he ſhall at the Command of Chriſt, blow the Trump of God, and Summon all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to appear before his Judgment Seat, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.16.</p>
                     <p>But there are two things in the Text and Doctrine before us which declare the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing Excellency and Glory of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>He is the object of Faith: One to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved on.</hi> Joh. 14.1. <hi>Ye believe on God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve alſo in me.</hi> That's a greater thing than may be ſaid of any other Man, nor might it be ſaid of Chriſt if he were not more than a Man. We may not truſt in any other for the Salvation of our Souls. It would be a curſed thing to do ſo. Jer. 17.5. <hi>Curſed be the man that truſteth in man.</hi> But to truſt in Chriſt is a bleſſed thing. Pſal. 2.12. <hi>Bleſſed are all they that put their truſt in him.</hi> This proves that Chriſt is more than a Man, as being the object of Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. For Faith is a ſpecial thing in that inward Worſhip of Soul, which is an honour too great for any Creature to receive. As all Religious Service, ſo in ſpecial believing, which is internal Worſhip, muſt be placed on no other object but God. <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> We may not Worſhip an Angel.
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:001981_0039_0FBA488D48CCD690"/>
They all with one voice ſay unto us, <hi>See you do it not,</hi> Rev. 19.10. But we may and ought to Worſhip Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God. All the Saints on Earth do ſo. <hi>In every place they call upon the Name of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> All the Angels in Heaven do ſo. <hi>Worſhip him all ye Angels.</hi> God Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands Men to Worſhip his Son. Pſal. 2.12. <hi>Kiſs the Son.</hi> i. e. not only in token of Love, but of <hi>Adoration.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Jeſus Christ is the Author of Life, yea, of Everlaſting Life.</hi> So does the Texts and Doctrine before us intimate, when 'tis ſaid. He that believes on him has Everlaſting Life. He is ſtyled, <hi>The Prince of Life,</hi> Act. 3.15. Who is it that can make the dead to live? The Son of God can do it, has done it, will do it, which is a more Excellent Glory than any Creature may pretend unto. An Angel cannot make a dead body to live again, much leſs a dead Soul. Chriſt does both. <hi>The hour cometh and now is, when the dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear ſhall live,</hi> Joh. 5.25. There is not a true Believer in all the World, but <hi>he liveth,</hi> and that not only as to a Natural, but a Spiritual Life, which will end in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life: but all the Believers on Earth are beholden to Jeſus Chriſt for whatever Life they have. Joh. 1.4. <hi>In him was the Life</hi>; in him as the fountain of it. There is Life enough in Chriſt for the quickning
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:001981_0040_0FBA489DEE6F19A8"/>
of Millions of dead periſhing Souls. There is an abundance of Life in him. Joh. 10.10. <hi>I am came that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.</hi> Hence <hi>Chriſt</hi> is called <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> becauſe he is the Author of it. 1 Joh. 5.20. <hi>We are in him that is true, even in his Son Jeſus Chriſt. This is the true God, and eternal life.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>The Life which Believers have through Jeſus Chriſt a right and title unto, is the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt life that can be deſired.</hi> Life is of all things the moſt deſirable. Happineſs is called Life. Pſal. 34.12. <hi>What man is he that deſireth life, and loveth many days, that

he may ſee good.</hi> Doth not every Man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that life in which happineſs doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt? True happineſs does not conſiſt in an Earthly ſenſual Life, for then the vileſt of Men would be happier than the beſt of Men, nay bruit beaſts ſome of which live hundreds of years, would be happier than Men. But in a Spiritual Celeſtial Life there is happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Such a Life as the Angels of Heaven live, who are always beholding the face of God, is bleſſedneſs. That's the Life which Believers ſhall live in another and a better World. Do Riches make life deſirable? What are earthly Riches compared with Heavenly? Follow me, (ſaith Chriſt) and thou ſhalt have <hi>Treaſure in Heaven.</hi> O the Riches of the Glory of that Inheritance! Does Pleaſures make Life deſirable? Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Celeſtial Pleaſures are the moſt deſirable. Believers when once in Heaven ſhall be made to <hi>drink of the River of thoſe pleaſures,</hi> Pſal. 36.8.

Matth. 25.46. <hi>The Righteous ſhall go into Life Eternal.</hi> If a Man enjoys a thing that is delightful to him, the thought of looſing it, is gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious The glorified Believer has no fear of being deprived of his happy Life. The Life which <hi>Adam</hi> had in Paradiſe he loſt it, and all his unhappy Children with him. But the life which Believers have by Jeſus Chriſt can never be loſt. Chriſt is alive, and behold he lives for ever more. Believers being united to him, and One with him, they alſo ſhall live for ever more. Joh. 14.19. <hi>Becauſe I live, ye live alſo.</hi> Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers then are the happieſt of Men. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, there are ſome that will ſay, We know that true Believers on Chriſt are happy, and we ſhould account our ſelves happy, if we knew that we our ſelves were ſuch: But how ſhall be know that?</p>

Have you been made willing to accept of Chriſt on his own terms? To receive him with his Croſs, To part with whatever ſtands in oppoſition to him, or in competition with him.

A true Faith is a Sanctifying Faith. It purifieth the heart, and turns a Sinner into a Saint. Act. 26.18. <hi>Sanctified by Faith.</hi> The Apoſtle directs Chriſtians to judge of their Faith by this. All pretences to believing without this will never prove a Saving Faith. Jam. 2.14. <hi>What doth it profit though a man ſay he hath Faith, and hath not works, Can Faith ſave him?</hi> No, ſuch a Faith can never ſave him. A workleſs Faith is a worthleſs Faith. The Apoſtle adds, Verſe 18. <hi>A man may ſay, Thou haſt Faith and I have Works, Shew me thy Faith without thy works, and I will ſhew thee my Faith by my Works.</hi> The works of true Sanctification are inſeparable and infallible ſigns of a true Believer on Jeſus Chriſt. But who is a <hi>real</hi> Saint? The Man that has reſpect to all the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God is ſo: No Man but the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever in Chriſt has ſo.

                     <p n="2">2. There is <hi>Poſitive Unbelief,</hi> which is a diſobedience to the Calls of the Goſpel. This Unbelief is the moſt damning Sin that ever any Man has been guilty of. Joh. 3.19. <hi>And this is the Condemnation that light is come into the World, and men love darkneſs ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than light.</hi> Chriſt is the moſt glorious
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:001981_0045_0FBA48AD78ADE728"/>
light that ever came into the World, but Men prefer Sin before Him. This brings them under the heavieſt Condemnation that poſſibly can be. The Unbeliever is not as yet Executed, but he is Condemned. Joh. 3.18. <hi>He that believeth not is condemned already.</hi> And what Puniſhment is he Condemned unto? To nothing leſs than death. And what death? A death not of the body only, but of the Soul; He is Condemned to ſuffer the pains not of the firſt death only, but of the <hi>Second Death.</hi> What is the Second Death? Rev. 21.8. <hi>The Unbelieving ſhall have their part in the Lake which burns with fire and brimſtone, which is the ſecond death.</hi> And that which makes it to be a death indeed, is the <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingneſs</hi> of it. The thought of it is ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing. Deſpairing <hi>Spira</hi> ſaid, <hi>If I were to be in Hell but for a thouſand Years, methinks it might be endured, but when I think of Eternity, I am amazed</hi> Ah! Woful Unbeliever, if thou were told that thou ſhouldſt be in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite Torments for a few Years, how would it aſtoniſh thee?

For the Lords ſake Conſider of it before it is too late.

that ever have been in the World. The Sinners in Sodom ſhall not have ſo hot a place in Hell as Unbelievers and Goſpel deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſers ſhall. It ſhall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than for that City, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.15. Pagans, meer Heathen will not be puniſhed as they ſhall. Wherefore it was ſaid to Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing <hi>Chorazin,</hi> and to Unbelieving <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaida,</hi> who lived under the Miniſtry of the beſt Preacher that ever was in the World, <hi>Wo to thee Chorazin, wo to thee Bethſaida, it ſhall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of Judgment than for you.</hi> Thy other Sins are ſmall compared with this. <hi>If I had not ſpoken to them, they had no ſin,</hi> did Chriſt ſay, none Comparatively. It may be ſome of you have been guilty of Secret Scarlet Sins, of Crimſon abominations; but thy Unbelief is thy greateſt Sin. If ever God intends Mercy to thy Soul, He will make thee ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it: For the holy Spirit does <hi>Convince the World of ſin,</hi> that they have been guilty of the moſt hainous Sin, <hi>becauſe they believe not,</hi> Joh. 16 9. There is no Sin that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes God like this. <hi>To whom did he ſwear in wrath that they ſhould not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not,</hi> Heb. 3.18. God ſending his Son into the World to be the Saviour of it, is the greateſt Mercy that ever was, therefore in Unbelief there is the greateſt ingratitude: And there is Blaſphemy in it. For Unbelievers give GOD the lye,

Believe on Jeſus Chriſt. As for Life on Earth, there is no Securing it: It is paſſing away every day. Thou haſt a day leſs to Live now, than thou hadſt Yeſterday. Thy Life is by a Week nearer to an End now, than it was the laſt Sabbath Day. But an Everlaſting Life in Heaven may be Secured by Believing on Jeſus Chriſt.

Say not, may I dare to believe and caſt my ſelf upon Chriſt for Life and Salvation! Is it not ſtrange that any Man ſhould ſay, May I dare to obey the Commandment of God? Make no Objections.

This ungrounded perſwaſion has undone the greateſt part of thoſe that call themſelves Chriſtians, and is the cauſe of their dying in a ſtate of Unbelief to their Eternal ruine.

It is <hi>Calvins</hi> note on thoſe words of the Prophet, <hi>That among thoſe that have the Goſpel Preach'd to them, ſcarce one in an hundred is a true Believer.</hi> As among the Jews there were many who profeſſed to know God, but in works they denied him. So many pretend to be Believers on Chriſt, but their works declare them to be no real Chriſtians. But beſides ſuch, There are many Moral Men of blameleſs Converſation, (as <hi>Paul</hi> was before his Converſion) who have no Saving Faith: And beſides theſe, many Hypocrites in the pureſt Churches, who have a ſeeming Faith, deceiving the World, deceiving Churches, and deceiving their own Souls. For the Lords ſake, Let not any of us be of that Number.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Be willing to part with what ever will keep thy Soul from cloſing with Chriſt. Any one Sin loved and lived in will make a Separation between Chriſt and thee. <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſaid to the Children of Iſrael, <hi>You cannot Serve the Lord,</hi> i. e. if you Serve Idols. And Chriſt ſays, You cannot Serve God and Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. No Man can ſerve two contrary Maſters.

Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, If I waſh thee not thou haſt no part in me.</hi> He ſayes to every Man, If thou art not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that I ſhould ſave thee from Sin as well as from Hell, thou canſt not be my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. Alſo thy Sinful Companions muſt be abandoned. <hi>Save your ſelves from this untoward Generation.</hi> If once thou art be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a ſerious Chriſtian they will abandon thee. Wherefore now <hi>forſake the fooliſh and live.</hi> And if thou wouldſt have Chriſt to be thine, beware of an heart glue'd to the World. That keeps many from cloſing with Chriſt. Chriſt is offered to them, but they make light of it, and <hi>Go away one to his Farm and another to his Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize,</hi> Matth. 22 5. Suppoſe a Man has a Jewel offered to him, if his hand is full of Earth he cannot take hold of it; So when Chriſt the Pearl of great price is in the Goſpel offered to Sinners, they cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, if their hearts will hold faſt the Earth ſtill.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Pray and Cry to GOD to make thee a Believer. For Faith is the gift of GOD. It is of his operation where ever it is found. Therefore he muſt be ſought unto for it. The caſe ſtands thus; either thou muſt believe on Jeſus Chriſt or periſh

Eternally. But thou art not able to believe by any power of thy own. Thou art no more able to believe by thine own power, than thou art able to create a World, or to raiſe the Dead. No Man can come to Chriſt except the Father draw him. O then Cry to GOD that He would pleaſe by His Almighty power to draw thee: Then ſhalt thou not only <hi>Go</hi> but <hi>Run</hi> to Him, as earneſtly as the Man ſlayer to the City of Refuge. And if GOD ſhall make a true Believer of thee, thou ſhalt receive the End of thy Faith, the Salvation of thy Soul in Everlaſting Life.</p>

                  <p>IN the former part of this Chapter, we have a Parable, the deſign whereof is to intimate that the Jews would reject Chriſt the Promiſed <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and that therefore they themſelves ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected from being the Church and People of God, and that the Gentiles ſhould become his People, and that among them, many ſhould be the Subjects of an External Call,
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:001981_0053_0FBA48CB28325438"/>
and that ſome (tho' but a few) would be the Subjects of an internal and effectual Call.</p>
                  <p>The words before us to inſiſt on are a Similitude or Parable in which there is.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The thing compared, Namely the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven. By the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven here we are to underſtand <hi>the Church of God</hi>; Eſpecially under the heavenly diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the Goſpel. The Church is a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and an heavenly Kingdom. It is under the Government of a heavenly King, and ruled by heavenly Laws.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is that unto which this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven is compared, Namely, to a King that made a Marriage for his Son; by the King underſtand the God and King of Heaven, and by his Son our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. The Marriage feaſt ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in the Parable, has reſpect to the benefits of Chriſt which are preferred to Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the Goſpel on condition of their conſent to the Marriage. In a Marriage there is the Bridegroom and the Bride, the Bridegroom is Chriſt, and the Bride, the few that are choſen, or the Church of true Believers.</p>

                  <p>PROP. I. <hi>That Believers while in this World are Married to Christ the Son of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is the Initiation and the Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this Marriage. The Initiation of it is in this World. As ſoon as a Man does believe his Soul is Married to Chriſt. The Apoſtle therefore ſayes to the Corinthians 2 Cor. 11.2. <hi>I have eſpouſed you to one Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, that I may preſent you as a chaſt Virgin unto Chriſt.</hi> The great work of the Miniſters of the Goſpel is to bring Souls to Chriſt; to woo and win Souls to Chriſt, therefore called the <hi>Friends of the Bridegroom,</hi> Joh. 3.29. The Truth before us is Evident.</p>
                  <p>For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Scripture does declare that there is a Spiritual Conjugal Relation between the Lord and his People. Jer. 3.14. <hi>I am Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to you, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Iſai. 54.5. <hi>Thy Maker is thy Husband, the God of the whole Earth ſhall he be called.</hi> That Implies that his Church ſhall be among the Gentiles; that he would be not only the God of the Jews, but of the Gentiles alſo. The Lord directs his Church to call him <hi>Iſhi,</hi> the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh of which word is, <hi>My Husband,</hi> Hoſ. 2.16. And Chriſt calls his Church, <hi>His Spouſe,</hi> Cant. 4.10. And the Church is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The Lambs Wife,</hi> Rev. 21.9.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="52" facs="unknown:001981_0055_0FBA48D6CC2519B0"/>2. This holy Truth was Myſteriouſly ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifyed by ſeveral Types which did Figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively repreſent it to us. As now, The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage God made between <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> was a Type of this. Eph. 5.32. <hi>They two ſhall be one fleſh; this is a great Mystery, but I ſpeak concerning Christ and the Church.</hi> That Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage had a Myſtery in it as reſpecting the Relation that is between Chriſt and the Church. <hi>Adam</hi> was caſt into a deep ſleep, and <hi>Eve</hi> taken out of him and given to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chriſt has been caſt into the deep ſleep of death, and by means of this the Church is produced. And Solomons Marriage was a Type hereof. The <hi>Song of Songs</hi> is an <hi>Epitha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamium,</hi> in Praiſe of Chriſt and his Church. It was the manner among the Jews, that when Perſons of Quality were Married they had Songs in Praiſe of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom and the Bride. The <hi>Song of Solomon,</hi> is ſuch an One; it ſhews forth the Praiſes of Chriſt and his Church: And the XLV. Pſalm is like it. Solomon Married <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Daughter who was a Gentile, and thereby was ſignified that Chriſt ſhould be Married to the Gentiles, that is, have his Church among them. Pſal. 45.10. <hi>O Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter forget thy own People and thy Fathers houſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. If we conſider the things that are re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quiſite in order to conjugal Relation, we ſhall ſee that there is a bleſſed Marriage be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and his Church. <hi>e. g.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) The Fathers Conſent is requiſite there
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:001981_0056_0FBA48E1B92F7720"/>
unto. God Conſents that his Son ſhould be Married to his Church. He has made this bleſſed Match; wherefore, the Text ſayes. <hi>A King made a Marriage for his Son.</hi> We Read of the Marriage Feaſt, as provided by him, which implies his Conſent. <hi>Verſe</hi> 4. <hi>I have prepared my dinner,</hi> ſays the King. God has given his Son to his Church to be the head thereof. Iſai. 9.6. <hi>Unto us a Son is given, his Name is called Wonderful, the Prince of Peace.</hi> So he has given his Church to Chriſt, as Chriſt to them. Chriſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid, Joh. 17.9, 10. <hi>I pray for thoſe that thou haſt given me: All mine are thine, and thine are mine.</hi> It is God that perſwades and draws the Souls of his Elect to Chriſt. Joh. 6.44. <hi>No man can come to me except the Father draw him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) Another thing requiſite in Marriage is the Conſent of the Perſons concerned therein. Tho' their Parents be never ſo willing to the Match, if the Parties concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned do not Conſent to take each other, there can be no conjugal Relation. Chriſt has conſented that his Church ſhould be ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to him: He has given himſelf <hi>for</hi> his Church, and given himſelf <hi>to</hi> them, and owns them to be his in the moſt peculiar Relation. Cant. 8.12. <hi>My Vineyard is mine,</hi> ſayes Chriſt. As for Believers, they are mine ſayes Chriſt. And as Chriſt has given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to his Church, ſo Believers have given themſelves to him. 2 Cor. 8.5. <hi>They gave
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:001981_0057_0FBA48E2ECE79B00"/>
themſelves to the Lord.</hi> A true ſaving Faith does conſiſt in this very thing eſpecially, when a Man gives himſelf to Chriſt, as his Lord and Saviour, to be his as his only, and his for ever; that is a ſaving Faith. Chriſt ſayes, <hi>Give me thy heart</hi>; the Believer ſayes, My heart thou ſhalt have with all my heart. This Mutual Conſent between Chriſt and the Believer, we ſee in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.12. It is ſaid of the Kings Daughter, <hi>The King ſhall greatly deſire thy beauty. He is thy Lord, and worſhip thou him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>PROP. II. <hi>That the bleſſed Marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Son of God and the Believer, will be Compleated at the laſt day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was cuſtomary among the Jews, that Married People were firſt Eſpouſed, and then they were eſteemed Husband and Wife; and in due time the Marriage was compleated. In this Life Believers are Eſpouſed to Chriſt. At his Second coming will be the Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Marriage. Chriſt will then come as a Bridegroom. Matth. 25.5. <hi>The Bridegroom is come, go ye out to meet him.</hi> Then the Church of Chriſt is every way ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for him, bedeck'd with Grace &amp; Glory, and all Sin and Imperfection taken away. Rev. 10.7. <hi>The Marriage of the Lamb is come, and his Wife has made her ſelf ready.</hi> It will be ſo at the laſt day, then the Church will have on all her Ornaments. Iſai. 61.10.
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:001981_0058_0FBA48E40D166B08"/>
                     <hi>Covered with a Robe, with the garments of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as a bride adorneth her ſelf with her Jewels.</hi> Then the Church will appear a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Church indeed. Eph. 5.27. Chriſt will <hi>preſent</hi> her a <hi>glorious Church without ſpot or wrinkle or any ſuch thing.</hi> Then comes the bleſſed Marriage Supper. Rev. 19.9. <hi>Bleſſed are they that are called to the Marriage ſupper of the Lamb.</hi> This bleſſedneſs is intimated to Believers when they come to the Lords Table. Luk. 22.29, 30. <hi>I appoint to you a Kingdom</hi> (ſays Chriſt) <hi>You ſhall eat and drink with me at my Table in my Kingdom; You ſhall fit upon thrones.</hi> This is ſignified and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to Believers in this holy Ordinance, of the Lords Supper. At the laſt day Chriſt and his Church will be together and live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and never more be ſeparated for ſo much as one day: they ſhall ever be with the Lord. Rev. 21.2, 3. <hi>New Jeruſalem comes down from God our of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her Husband: And the Tabernacle of God is with men, and he ſhall dwell with them.</hi> Chriſt who is God ſhall dwell with them: They ſhall be with Chriſt during the diſpenſation of the laſt Judgment, which will not be as many imagine a day of Twenty-four hours only, but doubtleſs will continue a long time. Eminent Divines ſuppoſe it will laſt for a thouſand Years. And all that time Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers ſhall be with Chriſt; and after that they ſhall go to Heaven together. The Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and Wife dwell together in the ſame
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:001981_0059_0FBA48E58596D4F8"/>
Houſe: So it ſhall be with Chriſt and his Church, they ſhall dwell together in the ſame Houſe, and it will be in his Fathers Houſe, which is ſuch a glorious Palace as Mortal eye never did behold the like. Joh. 14.2, 3. <hi>Many Manſions are in my Fathers houſe. I go to prepare a place for you, and will come again and receive you to my ſelf, that where I am you may be alſo.</hi> So ſhall they dwell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in his Fathers Houſe throughout the never ending days of Eternity.</p>
                  <p>PROP. III. <hi>That the Relation between Chriſt and his Church will abide for ever and ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This indeed is the only Marriage that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be diſſolved. As for all Earthly Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Death diſſolves them. Rom. 7.2. <hi>If the Husband is dead the Wife is looſed from the Law of her Husband.</hi> But the Relation between Chriſt and his Church has no end. Chriſt ſayes to his Church, Hoſ. 2.19. <hi>I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troth thee to me for ever.</hi> This Relation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to Eternity, as long as the Eternal Son of God and the Immortal Souls of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers ſhall live, ſo long ſhall this Relation continue. As in Marriages the Relation continues ſo long as both Parties ſhall live: ſo it is here. Chriſt the Son of God he lives for ever, He is Yeſterday, and to day and for ever the ſame. The Jews ſaid, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.34. We have heard out of the Law that <hi>Chriſt
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:001981_0060_0FBA48E701F63E38"/>
abides for ever</hi>: He does ſo. Tho' he was once as to his Body ſubject to death. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.18. He ſaid from Heaven, <hi>I was dead and I am alive, and behold I live for ever more.</hi> Chriſt lives for ever more. And as for Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers they ſhall never die, Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Martha,</hi> Joh. 11.26. <hi>He that believes in me ſhall never die</hi>; and he ſaid, <hi>If a man keeps my ſayings, he ſhall never ſee death,</hi> Joh. 8.51. Altho' a Natural Death, the Death of the Body is that which they are as ſubject to as other Men; yet their Souls live and their Bodies too ſhall awake out of the ſleep of death; and after the Reſurrection they ſhall be equal to the Angels, and then they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not die any more: therefore the Relation between Chriſt and them will continue to all Eternity: It abides in Heaven, for in Heaven is the Marriage Feaſt: a Feaſt is there the like where-unto was never known on Earth, as to the greatneſs of the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, the rejoycing and the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it. The King of <hi>Perſia</hi> made a Feaſt for all his Princes, <hi>Eſther</hi> 1.3. which laſted a hundred and eighty days together; but this Feaſt laſts infinitely longer than a hundred and eighty Millions of Years. The Scripture ſets forth heavenly things by Earthly Similitudes, otherwſe we could not conceive of them, no heart can conceive what is to be injoyed in Heaven. Chriſt ſaid to the Jews, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3 9. <hi>If I ſhould tell you heavenly things how could you believe</hi>? If
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:001981_0061_0FBA48EBE7650988"/>
heavenly things ſhould be ſet before us in their own proper Dialect, we could not comprehend them. Therefore earthly Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes are made uſe of to ſet forth thoſe things, and eſpecially this of a Marriage Feaſt, to denote the happineſs and joy of Heaven. Many times at Feaſts there is great Joy; but the greateſt Joy of Believers will be in Heaven: There <hi>Everlasting joy ſhall be upon their heads,</hi> Iſai. 35 10. There is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Joy, and there are pleaſure for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. That holy Man Mr. <hi>Jordan</hi> being at a Feaſt, ſaid, At a Feaſt there is good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and ſo there is in Heaven, and here is good Chear, ſo there is in Heaven, and far better, but anon we hear that word <hi>Take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi>; that word will never be heard in Heaven.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>There is an high dignity that does belong to Believers on Chriſt.</hi> They ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected and honoured, becauſe of the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they ſtand in to the Son of God. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' they are generally deſpiſed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned in the World: Yea, the beſt of them are ſo. 1 Cor. 4.13. <hi>We are made the filth of the world, &amp; the off ſcouring of all things.</hi> Nevertheleſs they are no contemptible Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: They are honourable. They are ſo in the Eyes of good Men. It is given as the Character of the Upright Man, Pſal. 15.4. <hi>He honours them that fear the Lord.</hi> As God
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:001981_0062_0FBA48F2434382A0"/>
himſelf does reſpect them: He ſayes of his Church, <hi>Thou was Precious in my ſight and honourable,</hi> Iſai. 43.4. So there is a dignity belonging to them becauſe of their Relation to Chriſt. If a King Marry a mean Perſon, there is a dignity belonging to ſuch an one. As <hi>Eſther</hi> when Married to the King. Is there not a dignity belonging to the Kings Daughter? The Church is called ſo, Pſal. 45 13. <hi>The Kings Daughter is all glorious with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</hi> Yea, She is a Queen, <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>The Queen ſtands at thy right hand in Gold of Ophir.</hi> That Scripture will be fulfilled at the laſt day, when all Believers ſhall ſtand at the right hand of Chriſt.</p>

                     <p>From this Doctrine <hi>we may Infer the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers Felicity as well as Dignity.</hi> A good Match is a ſingular happineſs. Chriſt is the moſt deſireable one that ever was or that poſſibly can be. To be Married to the Son of God, To the only Son of the King of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, What greater Dignity? What greater Felicity? Chriſt is the Wiſeſt and Richeſt that can be thought of: Angels proclaim it. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.12. The Angels ſaid, <hi>Worthy is the Lamb that is ſlain to receive honour, &amp; glory, and power, and wiſdom, and riches.</hi> That is to ſay, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be acknowledged the Richeſt and Wiſeſt, and moſt Powerful and Honourable that can be mentioned. Was not Pharaohs
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:001981_0063_0FBA4900954C6C50"/>
Daughter happy in being Married to Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon! Behold a greater than Solomon is here. The Soul that is Married to him is made happy for ever.</p>
                     <p>Several things may be mentioned, which declare the happineſs of Believers by reaſon hereof.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There can be no Law-ſuits againſt them. <hi>Urori lis non intenditur.</hi> The Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is reſponſible for his Wives debts. The Wiſe can't be Sued as long as her Husband liveth. So is the caſe here. The debts which we owe, Chriſt has undertaken the payment of. He has ſuffered to make ſatisfaction to God for all our Sins, which are our debts. God has imputed them to him, becauſe he became our Surety, and promiſed to make Satisfaction for all we did owe to the Juſtice of God. Accordingly God has charged Chriſt with all the debts of his People. Iſai 53.6. <hi>Upon him was laid the Iniquity of us all.</hi> Therefore Juſtice will not come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, will not demand ſatisfaction of the Surety, and of the Principal too. Rom. 8.33, 34. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect?</hi> What? have they not been guilty of many Sins? Yea, but God Juſtifies for all that, <hi>Who ſhall condemn? It is Chriſt that dyed, yea rather that is riſen again:</hi> which implies that God has received full ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the death of his Son. Chriſt is come out of the Priſon of the Grave, and God has thereby declared Himſelf fully Satisfied.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="61" facs="unknown:001981_0064_0FBA490475699580"/>2. Believers thus related to Chriſt ſhall be protected and defended againſt all their Enemies. Chriſt their Husband will be their Protector, and happy are they in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuch a Protector. It was ſaid to <hi>Sarah,</hi> That Abraham her Husband ſhould be a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to her Eyes. h.c.</hi> A vail to defend her from injuries, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.16. So Chriſt defends his Church. If any offer wrong to them they ſhall pay dear for it. Chriſt ſayes of them, <hi>He that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his Eye:</hi> that we may be ſure Chriſt will never indure, <hi>Zech.</hi> 2.8.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Becauſe of their Relation to Chriſt, Believers are ſure to be well provided for. He is able to provide well for them: They ſhall never want for any thing ſince Chriſt is their Head and Husband. They ſhant want Clothing, they ſhall have the beſt Robe given to them. In <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.1. We read of <hi>a Woman clothed with the Sun.</hi> Who is that Woman but the Church of Chriſt? What is that Sun with which ſhe is cloathed, but the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt? Chriſt is <hi>the Sun of Righteouſneſs.</hi> They ſhant want for Food. Iſai. 25.6. <hi>The Lord of Hoſts has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared a feaſt of fat things, and of wines well refined on the lees.</hi> And what will Chriſt feed his People with? He will feed them with Manna, with the bread of Heaven. What is that bread Chriſt gives? It is the bread of Life. Bread which if a Man eat thereof,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:001981_0065_0FBA4905E178B9C0"/>
he ſhall not dye, but live for ever. Chriſt feeds Believers with the bread of Life, and with the water of Life. Rev. 7.17. <hi>The Lamb ſhall feed them and lead them unto living fountains of waters.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. Since Believers are Married to Chriſt, Chriſt and all that belongs to him is theirs. They have an Intereſt in his Perſon: They are his and He theirs. <hi>My beloved is mine and I am his,</hi> Cant. 2.16. And they have an Intereſt in his Eſtate; all the Eſtate that belongs to Chriſt, belongs to them. Rom. 8.17. <hi>They are heirs of God and joynt heirs with Chriſt.</hi> A Kingdom is the greateſt Riches: Believers on Chriſt are heirs of a bleſſed Kingdom And more than ſo, by reaſon that the Inheritance of Chriſt is theirs, all things are theirs; for what is that Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance? it is no leſs than all things: He is ſaid to be <hi>the heir of all things.</hi> Is it not ſaid of Believers, <hi>That they ſhall Inherit all things</hi>? Rev. 21.7.</p>

                        <hi>We may here ſee the wonderful Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in that He becomes ſo related to ſuch as we are: we may know that Chriſt is infinitely gracious from this very thing. 2 Cor. 8.9. <hi>You know the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, altho' he was rich, yet became poor for your ſakes, that thro' his povert you might be made rich.</hi> This appears, if we

Conſider, who Chriſt is, and what we are,</p>
                     <p n="1">(1.) Who Chriſt is. He is a King, the moſt glorious King that can be mentioned. Pſal. 24.10. <hi>Who is the King of Glory? the Lord of Hoſt he is the King of glory,</hi> that is the moſt glorious King; Chriſt he is that King: He is <hi>the Lord of Host</hi>: All the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in Heaven and Earth are all under the Command of Jeſus Chriſt. He is the Lord of Lords, and King of Kings. And he is the Son of God, as in the Text: <hi>A King made a Marriage for his Son.</hi> He is the Son of God, of the ſame Nature with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; he ſaid God was his Father, ſo made himſelf Equal with God, and thought it no Robbery to do ſo. It is Infinite Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention in him to look on the higheſt Angel in Heaven. He humbles himſelf to behold things in Heaven, how much more then for him to look upon Men, ſuch poor Creatures as we are. How wonderful is it, that he ſhould be Married to our Nature? The Son of God is ſo in reſpect of his Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, He has taken the Nature of Man into his own Perſon to be One with him. O Wonderful! And as for particular Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, they are taken into the neareſt U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Chriſt. O let it affect all our hearts!</p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) Conſider what we are. Who or what are we, that Chriſt the Son of God ſhould give himſelf to us, and not to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:001981_0067_0FBA490A659AC138"/>
Heb. 2.16. <hi>He took not the nature of Angels,</hi> but the Nature of Man. What is Man that the King of Heaven and Earth ſhould be thus mindful of him? If a Prince ſhould Marry a Peaſant, would it not be admired at! To do ſo is not the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Men. There is uſually ſome external Motive that inclines them in their choice. What was it that did Incline Chriſt to us, but his own Grace and Goodneſs? <hi>Jacob</hi> choſe <hi>Rachel</hi> rather than <hi>Leah,</hi> becauſe of her beauty. But there is nothing to incline Chriſt to chooſe his Elect, in them was no beauty, before Chriſt ſet his heart upon them. Their beauty is perfect through the Comli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which he has put upon them. All the Comlineſs that the Souls of Believers are ſet off, and adorned with, is from Chriſt. But in themſelves ſeparate from Chriſt, they are woful Creatures. Ezek. 16.5, 6. <hi>I ſaw them when caſt out to the loathing of thy Perſon, when thou wast in thy blood, I ſaid unto thee, live; yea, when thou wast in thy blood, I ſaid unto thee, live.</hi> Sometimes Men in their choice look at Birth, and Parentage. Chriſt did not ſo, in chuſing us. Does he not ſay <hi>Thy Father was an Ammorite thy Mother a Hit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite.</hi> Men look at Portions and Riches we have none. Chriſt did not chuſe us for any Riches: He hath choſen the Poor of this World, ſuch as were Morally as well as Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally Poor: Poor as Beggars. <hi>Miſerable Wretched,</hi> Poor, <hi>Blind</hi> and <hi>Naked.</hi> So it is
<pb facs="unknown:001981_0068_0FBA4914AD63FEC0"/>
with Men by Nature; they han't ſo much as Rags to Cover their Nakedneſs. Now, that Chriſt ſhould look after ſuch, and chooſe ſuch, is an Evidence of aſtoniſhing Grace.</p>
                     <p>Let the laſt USE be a double Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                     <p>EXHOR. I. <hi>O that every Soul would make ſure of being Married to Jeſus Chriſt the Son of GOD.</hi> Might this be the Effect of what I have been ſpeaking, it would be the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt Sermon that ever I Preached.</p>
                     <p>Conſider. <hi>CHRIST is Offered unto you.</hi> There is not one Soul, Man nor Woman here, but Chriſt is offered to you to be in the neareſt Relation to you. God himſelf offers him to you, and ſends his Servants for that end. It's ſaid in the Context before us, The King ſent his Servants to Invite them to come, Saying, all things are ready, <hi>Come to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</hi> The ſpecial work of the Embaſſadors of Heaven is to woo Souls for Chriſt. As Abraham ſent his Servant to perſwade Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca, to become a Wife to his Son Iſaac: So God ſends ſome to Preach the Goſpel, and to Call upon Sinners to Come to Chriſt; Submit to him, and Accept of him to be the it Lord and Saviour, Head &amp; Husband. And as God offers his Son to every Soul where the Goſpel comes: So Chriſt offers himſelf,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:001981_0069_0FBA4916E4F0A270"/>
                        <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.4. <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> that is <hi>Christ</hi> ſays, <hi>I have furniſhed my Table, Come and eat of my bread and drink of the wine that I have mingled.</hi> Thus does Wiſdom <hi>ſend forth her Maidens,</hi> that is Chriſt his Miniſters to proclaim this. And unto whom does the Lord Jeſus Chriſt offer himſelf? To <hi>whoſoever will,</hi> let them come to him, He will accept of them; if they come with a heart really willing to ſubmit to him. He ſayes, <hi>Let him that heareth, Come: And whoſoever will let him take the water of Life freely,</hi> Rev. 22.17.</p>
                     <p>Conſider. <hi>You will never be better offered.</hi> What wouldſt thou have? What canſt thou deſire in ſuch a Relation, but thou mayſt have it in Chriſt? Would you have a Wiſe Man? Chriſt is wiſer than <hi>Solomon.</hi> In him are hid <hi>all the treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledge:</hi> Subjectively as well as Objective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.3. Chriſt is called, <hi>The Wiſdom of God.</hi> Do you deſire one that is Rich: In Chriſt there is Unſearchable Riches. Wouldſt thou have Beauty? Chriſt is fairer than the Children of Men. He is altogether Lovely. Doeſt thou deſire High-birth, or One Great and Honourable: Chriſt is ſo; all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in Heaven do honour him. <hi>Worſhip him all ye Angels.</hi> He is the Son of God. The greateſt Emperors on Earth are his vaſſals: Some of them have ſtyled themſelves, <hi>A veſſel of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

Hearken now for he will not always make the offer. Chriſt ſaid to Jeruſalem, <hi>How often would I have gathered you under my wings, and ye would not</hi>? How often has Chriſt the Son of God ſpoken to thee and offered himſelf to thee? yet thou haſt not regarded: take heed leſt thou have no more offer; mayſt not thou fear it. It may be this is the laſt offer that ſome that hear me this day ſhall ever have: then ſlight not the offer, as you love your Souls.</p>
                     <p>Do any of you ſay, What ſhall we do that Chriſt may be ours and we his? That we may come into this bleſſed Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> If we would have Chriſt we muſt reſolve to be for him and not for another. Reſolve to Renounce all other Lords and Lovers that ſtand in Oppoſition to, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Say as the Lords People do, <hi>Altho' other Lords have had dominion over us, now we will make mention of thy Name only.</hi> So muſt you ſay, Tho' Sin, tho' Self, tho' the World has had dominion over me, yet I renounce all, and part with all for Chriſt. Conſent ſincerely to the motion of the Goſpel, and the thing
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:001981_0071_0FBA4919F2972818"/>
is done: It is but that one thing and the Match is made; and thou art made for Eternity, if thou doeſt but that One thing. Then Conſent to the offer of the Goſpel with all thy heart.</p>
                     <p>The Second EXHORTATION is to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers who are Married to Chriſt: <hi>Approve your Selves as your Relation to Him does call for.</hi> And how is that?</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>To Love Chriſt.</hi> To love him above all things; to love him more than any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. We are apt to love Creatures more than we ſhould; there is not any of us but have been guilty of that Idolatry more or leſs; but reſolve now to love Chriſt more than any Creature. It is impoſſible for us to love Chriſt too much. Its uſual with many People to ſay, I love ſuch a thing with all my heart; that's no good ſaying, We muſt love none but Chriſt with all our hearts, becauſe he is moſt worthy of our love; He is ſo in reſpect of what he is in himſelf, the moſt lovely One that can be deſired, <hi>the Chief of ten thouſands.</hi> The worſt that can be ſaid of Chriſt is better than all the Pleaſures that this World can afford. Namely, his Croſs, his Sufferings. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.26. Moſes did <hi>Eſteem the reproach of Christ greater Riches than the treaſures of Egypt.</hi> And Chriſt is moſt worthy of our love in reſpect of what he has done for us. What has he done?
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:001981_0072_0FBA492F4DAA7190"/>
He has paid all our debts, that we could not; we muſt have remained in a woful Priſon for ever, if Chriſt had not paid our debts for us: And ſhall we not love him? And he has deſtroyed our Enemies, our greateſt Enemies, Sin and Satan; He has ſaved us from the Enemies of our Souls, and Salvation; and ſhall we not love him? All the Creatures in the whole World could not deliver us from the Wrath of God, but <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus has delivered us from the wrath to come</hi>; and ſhall we not love him?</p>
                     <p>And 2. <hi>Let us Study to pleaſe Christ.</hi> Let us dy rather than do any thing that grieves him. <hi>I charge you, O ye Daughters of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem that you awake not my love until he pleaſe.</hi> Any death is better than to offend Chriſt. Would you pleaſe Chriſt? Then you may not ſeek to pleaſe the World. Gal. 1.10. <hi>If I pleaſe men I am no longer a Servant of Chriſt.</hi> If Men demand this or that of us, we ſhould think, Will this pleaſe Chriſt? if ſo, then we may do it, but otherwiſe, not. Let us then do the things that are pleaſing to him. And what will pleaſe him? If we bring forth much Fruit, that will pleaſe him. He loves to come into his Garden and <hi>Eat his pleaſant fruits,</hi> Cant. 4.16. Does Grace thrive in our Souls? That is very pleaſing to him. Do theſe Spices flow out? The Exerciſe of Grace, that is very pleaſing to
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:001981_0073_0FBA493138DE2AA0"/>
Chriſt. If we Pray much, that will pleaſe him: He loves to ſee us often upon our Knees, eſpecially in Secret: That is pleaſing to him. If we accuſtom our ſelves to the deepeſt Humiliations before him, that is pleaſing to him. If we keep his Commandments, we ſhall pleaſe him, ſo that he will deny us nothing that ſhall be good for us to receive. 1 Joh. 3.22. <hi>Whatever we ask we receive, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we Keep his Commandments, and do thoſe things that are pleaſing in his ſight.</hi>

<pb n="72" facs="unknown:001981_0075_0FBA493AA6C6FC98"/>
Attendance to the Word of God. In the 5th and 6th verſes Men are Exhorted to Pray to Chriſt, To Worſhip and Kneel before him. In this verſe, they are Exhorted to Attend his Word, which is urged with weighty Reaſons: Particularly in that he is God, and in a particular manner his Peoples God; and in that he is their Shepherd, which implies his being their Feeder and their Protector, Therefore they ought to Pray to him and Hear his Voice.</p>
                  <p>In the words before us we have, (1.) The Duty to be done, ſcil. <hi>To hear the Voice of Chriſt</hi>; which intends Obedience. Often in the Scripture to <hi>Hear</hi> is to <hi>Obey. Hear</hi> (i. e. Obey) <hi>and your Souls ſhall live.</hi> (2.) The time when this ought to be done, <hi>To day.</hi> It may not be deferred until to Morrow, but muſt be done <hi>To day.</hi> The Doctrine before us, is,
<q>
                        <hi>DOCT.</hi> That Men ought not only to hear the Voice of CHRIST ſo as to Obey Him, but it is of Infinite Concernment for them to do it, To Day.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Doctrine may be Opened and Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in ſeveral Propoſitions.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>PROP. I.</hi> There are many in the World, whom the Lord is pleaſed to favour with a Day of Grace.</q>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="73" facs="unknown:001981_0076_0FBA493CACE8A4A0"/>When it is ſaid, <hi>To day</hi> hear his Voice, that is intended, hear the Voice of Chriſt whileſt you have a day of Grace vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed to you for that End. The day of Grace is in Scripture Expreſſed by that of <hi>a day for Men to know the things of their Peace,</hi> and <hi>by their time of Viſitation.</hi> And 'tis called, <hi>The day of Salvation</hi>; a day in which Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is offered and may be obtained. And <hi>a ſpace to Repent.</hi> Such a day Sinners who are gone out of this World are not favoured with. Altho' the Apoſtle ſpeaking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the damned Souls of the Sinners who lived in the Old World before the flood, ſayes, That the Spirit of Chriſt Preached to <hi>the Spirits in Priſon,</hi> which were ſometimes diſobedient in the days of Noah, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19. the meaning is not, that he Preached to them after they were in Priſon, <hi>i. e.</hi> in Hell, but before that whileſt they were living; the Spirit of Chriſt in the Miniſtry of Noah, Preached Repentance to them. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it is a Truth that no Sinners in the other World have a <hi>Day of Salvation</hi> vouchſafed to them, nevertheleſs, there are ſome in this World that have ſuch a day.</p>
                  <p>For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>There are many that Enjoy the light of the Goſpel</hi>; which is the ordinary <hi>Medium</hi> by which God works Grace in the Souls of Men, and ſo brings them unto Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by bringing the Goſpel to them,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:001981_0077_0FBA494230065790"/>
which is called, <hi>The Goſpel of our Salvation,</hi> Eph. 1.13. As for ſuch as have not the light of the Goſpel, they have no <hi>Day,</hi> 'tis always Night with them; they ſee no light but ſit in darkneſs and in the region of the ſhadow of death. But as for ſuch as have the Goſpel, 'tis <hi>Day</hi> with them. The Sun is riſen upon them, even <hi>the Sun of Righteouſneſs which has healing under his wings,</hi> Mal. 4.2. There was a time when for many Ages only one Nation had the light of Gods Word ſhining upon them; and they had but Moon light Comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>He ſhewed his Word to Jacob, he hath not dealt ſo with any Nation.</hi> That bleſſed light ſhined but on a little ſpot of ground, not two hundred Miles; as to the reſt of the World, darkneſs covered the Earth, and groſs darkneſs the People. But ſince Chriſt has come into the World, many parts of the Earth have been enlightned with the Goſpel. 1 Joh. 2.8. <hi>The darkneſs is past, and the true light now ſhines.</hi> The knowledge of Chriſt, which the Goſpel brings to the World is truly light, and the moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous light that ever ſhone on the Earth. Now they that Enjoy the Goſpel have a Day of Grace and Salvation offered to them. For the Goſpel offers Grace wherever it comes. It is the Grace of God that brings Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and has appeared to all Men. The Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel proclaims the Mercy of Heaven to Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners on the Earth. Chriſt then declares to
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:001981_0078_0FBA4943A5C26D78"/>
them, that there Sins ſhall be forgiven and their Souls ſaved, if they will <hi>hear his Voice.</hi> It makes a free offer of Life to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denmed Sinners; yes to all that come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the hearing of it, if they will accept of it on gracious Goſpel termes. Rev. 22.17. <hi>Whoſoever will let him take the water of Life freely.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The bleſſed God does not only offer Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to Sinners, but he waits with wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Patience to ſee whether they will accept of the Grace offered. He endureth with much long-ſuffering the veſſels of wrath,</hi> Rom. 9.22. He extends his Patience to <hi>Long-ſuffering,</hi> nay, to <hi>much</hi> Long-ſuffering. It is from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Grace in God that be makes an offer of Salvation to Sinners; ſuppoſe he ſhould do it but once, and then deſtroy them upon the firſt refuſal: but the Lord renews his offers of Grace and Mercy, and continues to do ſo, from day to day, nay, he waits Petiently for Years one after another, and ſtill finds himſelf diſappointed. Luk. 13.7. <hi>Theſe three years I came ſeeking fruit and find none. Life Time</hi> in this World is a <hi>Day of Grace.</hi> It is Compared to the Day, as death is reſembled to the Night: <hi>Night comes when no man can work.</hi> Men may do things in the <hi>Day Time,</hi> while they have light for what they do, which they cannot when the dark Night has overtaken them. So whileſt they Enjoy <hi>the Light of the Living</hi> they may be working about their Salvation
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:001981_0079_0FBA49472D8F9300"/>
which when in the dark Grave they cannot. <hi>There is no work in the Grave whither thou art going.</hi> There are ſome Sinners which Live threeſcore, yea, it may be four ſcore Years, or more, and all that time the Lord has waited to be gracious to them. He has ſpread out his hands, with a Scepter of Grace in them, to Rebellious ones, and that has he done <hi>all the Day,</hi> as long as they had a Day to live on this Earth. Thus it was with the Sinners of the Old World, they lived an hundred and twenty Years under the awakening Miniſtry of <hi>Noah,</hi> who was a Preacher of Righteouſneſs; there was the Voice of Chriſt ſpeaking to them in that Miniſtry, but they regarded it not; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, for <hi>ſo long a time</hi> did the Lord lengthen out the days of his Patience. Of this the Apoſtle takes notice, 1 Pet. 3.20. <hi>Who ſometimes were diſobedient when once the long ſuffering of God waited in the dayes of Noah, while the Ark was a preparing.</hi> When the Children of Iſrael were in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they continued in their Rebellious Practices for the ſpace of Forty Years; God was Patient and Long-ſuffering to them all that time, notwithſtanding their not <hi>hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Voice</hi>; wherefore it is ſaid in the next words following my Text, <hi>Harden not your hearts as in the provocation, and as in the day of Temptation in the Wilderneſs, when your Fathers tempted me, proved me and ſaw my works, forty years long was I grieved with
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:001981_0080_0FBA4949FA607540"/>
this Generation.</hi> The like Patience did the Lord Exerciſe towards the Jews after the Goſpel had been Preached to them by the Son of God himſelf, and by his Apoſtles. Chriſt indeed threatned them with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of their City and Temple, and that the means of Grace ſhould be taken from them, yet did he continue the Goſpel to them forty Years after they had rejected it.</p>
                  <p>PROP. II. <hi>When Men</hi> (<hi>a particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or People</hi>) <hi>are favoured with ſpecial ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to be attending the work of their Eternal Salvation, that is their day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Day of Grace does not conſiſt meerly in the allowance of Time, or a Space to Repent, and ſeek the face and favour of God, but in having ſpecial Advantages for it. To ſpeak more particularly,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>A Day of Proſperity is a day of Grace.</hi> Often in the Scripture a time of Adverſity is denoted by darkneſs and night; it is Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for Men to mind the concerns of their Souls before that Night overtake them. Jer. 13.16. <hi>Give Glory to the Lord your God before he cauſe darkneſs, and before your feet ſtumble on the dark Mountains.</hi> Says the Prophet, ere long you will be carried over the dark Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains into Captivity; give Glory to God by Repentance before that darkneſs comes upon you. <hi>David</hi> ſaid to the Princes of Iſrael,
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:001981_0081_0FBA4951310FCC98"/>
                     <hi>has not God given you reſt on every ſide? Now ſet you heart and your ſoul to ſeek the Lord your God.</hi> Becauſe of the preſent Peace and Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity you have a ſingular advantage to endeavour after the things wherein your Souls are concerned. Let not the Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſlip. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22.18, 19. Chriſt ſaid to Jeruſalem, O that thou hadſt known <hi>in this thy day</hi> the things which belong to thy Peace, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.42. The Jews were in great Proſperity when Chriſt ſpoke theſe words, they had Peace and Plenty, and Riches, and Health; but they did not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove <hi>their Day,</hi> they did not <hi>Hear the Voice of Christ</hi> in it. They knew not <hi>the time of their Viſitation</hi>; for which cauſe War, and Famine, and Sickneſs, and all ſorts of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery overtook them, and overwhelmed them. Men are more capable of minding their Spiritual as well as Temporal Welfare, in a time of Proſperity, than when they are in diſtreſſing Miſery. Eſpecially they are ſo in a time of Health, more than when painful diſeaſes are upon them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The</hi> Chriſtian Sabbath <hi>is a Day in which Men have ſpecial advantages to be promoving their Souls Good and Salvation: Wherefore they ſhould hear the Voice of Christ therein.</hi> It is called <hi>the Lords Day,</hi> Rev. 1.10. Since it is <hi>Chriſts Day,</hi> He will make it a bleſſed day to ſuch as ſhall then hear his Voice. Pſal. 518 24. <hi>This is the day which the Lord
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:001981_0082_0FBA495273839770"/>
hath made.</hi> He has made it, that ſo we might worſhip him on that Day as our Redeemer. For the ſpace of four thouſand Years from the Creation the <hi>Seventh day</hi> of the Week was the Day of ſolemn Worſhip, in Commemoration of God, His reſting on that Day from the Work of Creation; but the <hi>Firſt Day</hi> of the Week is the Chriſtian Sabbath in Commemoration of our Saviour Chriſt his riſing from the dead on that day, and ſo reſting from the Work of Redemption then finiſhed. The Lords Day has been a Day of Salvation to many a Soul; indeed to the generality of Gods Elect. Among the Lords Ancient People, when there was to be a ſolemn Feaſt, a Silver Trumpet was to be ſounded which called the People together. The Pſalmiſt alludes to that, Pſal. 89.15. <hi>Bleſſed is the People that know the joyful ſound.</hi> The ſounding of the Silver Trumpet, did figuratively ſignify the Preaching of the Goſpel. It is on the Lords Day that the Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Trumpet of the Goſpel ſounds, and then and thereby Chriſt himſelf is from Heaven ſpeaking to us. The <hi>Lords Day</hi> is a <hi>Market Day</hi> for the Soul. Is it a Spiritual Fair, in which Commodities are offered to Men as will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich their Souls. To refuſe them is the greateſt diſobedience to <hi>the Voice of Chriſt</hi> that poſſibly can be.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>There are Times when the Holy Spirit ſtrives with Sinners, that is their</hi> Day of Grace.
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:001981_0083_0FBA4953ACB30610"/>
It was the Spirit of Chriſt that did ſtrive with the Sinners of the Old World before the flood, and then they had a bleſſed day of Grace, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18, 19. but they did not <hi>hear his Voice in that their day.</hi> When Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners turn out of the way in which they ſhould go, they oft hear a Voice behind them ſaying, <hi>This is the way walk in it,</hi> Iſai. 30.21. The Voice of Chriſts Word and Spirit directs them into the right way. Bleſſed are they that hear it, and obey it. There are <hi>Saving Operations</hi> of the Holy Spirit on the Souls of the Elect. There are alſo <hi>Common Operations</hi> thereof in the Hearts of Reprobates, by which Chriſt is ſpeaking to them, and ſtriving with them, and Grace is offered to them. Sometimes the Holy Spirit ſtrives by great Illuminations in the Mind. Some have proved total and final Apoſtates, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Unpardonable Sin; <hi>Who were once Enlightned, and have taſted of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly gift, and were made partakers of the holy Ghost, and have taſted the good word of God, and the powers of the World to come,</hi> Heb. 6.3, 4. Sometimes the Holy Spirit ſtrives with Sinners by Convincing them of their Sin and Miſery, and awakening their Conſciences with diſmal fears of a Wrath to come. The Scripture ſpeaks of a <hi>Spirit of Bondage unto fear,</hi> Rom. 8.15 Many a Sinner has Experience of it. He hears that he has tranſgreſſed the Law of God, and is bound over to the Great Aſſizes. He is
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:001981_0084_0FBA495514EDE130"/>
afraid of Death and Hell. O what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of me in another World to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity! Would he hearken to the Voice of Chriſt in theſe Convictions, it may be they Would iſſue in Converſion and Salvation. There was ſomething of this <hi>Spirit of bondage unto fear</hi> in <hi>Felix,</hi> when he heard <hi>Paul</hi> Preach an awakening Sermon concerning Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and Temperance, and Judgment to come, <hi>Felix Trembled,</hi> Act. 24.25. Happy had he been, if he had obeyed the Voice of the Spirit of Chriſt in theſe Convictions and Terrors of his Conſcience. Sometimes the Holy Spirit ſtrives with the hearts of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in cauſing good Affections to be ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in them: but they have quenched the holy fire which the holy Spirit has kindled in them. It may be at times they have wept at Sermons, and it may be at times have received the Word with Joy. Nay, they have been ſo affected as <hi>almoſt</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to forſake their Sins, and to become Chriſtians indeed. Was it not ſo with <hi>Agrippa?</hi> He was <hi>almost perſwaded</hi> to be a Chriſtian, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.28. Yea, many times the Holy Spirit ſtrives with Sinners, ſo as to cauſe a great Reformation in them, and yet no thorough ſaving work upon them. They have been ſwept and garniſhed, and the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Spirit has gone out of them for a time, but afterwards Seven Devils have entred for One before, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.45. They have eſcaped the Pollutions of the World through the
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:001981_0085_0FBA495D0B48A048"/>
Knowledge of Chriſt; yet but a common work of the Holy Spirit on them, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20. Was it not thus with <hi>Herod</hi>? He lived under <hi>John Baptiſts</hi> powerful Miniſtry, heard him gladly, and <hi>did many things,</hi> Mark 6.20. Now when the Spirit of God is at work in the hearts of Sinners, altho' but with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and not a ſaving Work, they are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned to hear the Voice of Chriſt, that ſo the work may prove ſaving.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>The Preſent Time is the Day of Grace.</hi> 2 Cor. 6.2. <hi>Behold Now is the accepted time, behold Now is the day of Salvation.</hi> Not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, but <hi>Now</hi> If you would be ſaved hear the Voice of Chriſt <hi>Now</hi>; if you would have God accept of you, return to him <hi>Now</hi>: For <hi>Now</hi> is the time, Behold it, behold it. This was the Voice of God by all his holy Prophets; they all with one Voice cried, <hi>Turn ye</hi> NOW <hi>from your evil way.</hi> The Lord does not ſay, <hi>To Morrow,</hi> if you will hear his Voice, you ſhall be ſaved, but <hi>To Day,</hi> if you will hear his Voice. <hi>Now</hi> or the preſent Time, is the only time that any Man is ſure of. As for the Time paſt it is gone irrecoverably. Yeſterday will never be here again. The Time paſt was thine, but it ſhall never be thine any more. Time to come is very uncertain. Sinners when they are Exhorted to Repent, and Believe on Chriſt, are apt to ſay, it is good Counſil, but they had rather do it <hi>To Morrow</hi> than
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:001981_0086_0FBA495FEAB2E0B0"/>
                     <hi>To Day</hi>; when as it is uncertain whether they will ever ſee a To Morrow. Prov. 27.1. <hi>Boaſt not thy ſelf of to morrow, for thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not what a day may bring forth.</hi> For ought thou knoweſt, or any Man living, thou mayeſt be in another World to Morrow. So then the preſent time is thy day. And as for the preſent Time, it does not ſtand ſtill, but is flying away. The wings of time are ſwifter than the wings of an Eagle. Job 9.27, 28. <hi>My dayes are ſwifter than a Poſt: they flee away, as the Eagle that haſteth to the prey.</hi> What is ſwifter than that? So then the preſent time without any the leaſt delay, <hi>is thy day of Grace,</hi> in which it is thy duty to hear the Voice of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>PROP. III. <hi>Sinners are Infinitely Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to hear the Voice of Christ, in this their day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Text ſayes <hi>To Day.</hi> If you will hear his Voice; <hi>If</hi> ſo. What then? Then you are for ever happy. <hi>If</hi> not, Infinitely miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. The Aſſertion before us is truth.</p>
                  <p>For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>An Eternity of Weal or of Wo depends on this.</hi> Are not Men Infinitely concerned in that which their Eternity depends upon. If any Man was told that he ſhould be in happineſs or in miſery for ſome Scores of Years, would he not be greatly concerned about it? How much more when the
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:001981_0087_0FBA4961DF007278"/>
Word of God informs him of that on which an Eternity of Weal or Wo depends? For ſo it does on his hearing or not hearing the Voice of Chriſt <hi>whileſt it is day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>If Sinners hear his Voice Now before their day is past, they ſhall certainly find Mercy; God will then be found of them.</hi> Iſai. 55.6. <hi>Seek ye the Lord while he may be found.</hi> While the day of Grace laſt is a finding time. No Sinner did ever repent and return to God within that time, but the Lord had Mercy on him, and has abundantly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned his many and great Sins. Come before it is too late. Come before Sun ſet. Come before the Maſter of the houſe has ſhut to the door, and you are ſure of finding acceptance with him; He will in no wiſe caſt you out, if you come to him, <hi>To Day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>If Sinners harden their hearts, and will not hear the Voice of Chriſt until</hi> their day <hi>is paſt and gone, there is no hope of Mercy for them.</hi> Whrefore the Prophet ſayes, <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your ſelves together, O Nation,</hi> in order to the ſolemneſt Humiliations, <hi>before the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree bring forth,</hi> Zeph. 2.1, 2. When the day of Grace is paſt, <hi>the decree brings forth.</hi> Repentance is too late then. It is with ſuch undone Sinners as with thoſe miſerable Jews who ſaid, <hi>Hold thy tongue, for we may not make mention of the Name of the Lord</hi>; ſay they, it is too late to Pray now, for God is Executing
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:001981_0088_0FBA49636663AAD0"/>
the Sentence which we were adviſed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, but did it not in due ſeaſon, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.10. When the day of Grace is paſt, God ſaith of ſuch Periſhing Creatures, Call their Name <hi>Lo-Ruhamah,</hi> for I will no more have Mercy on them, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1.6. He writes over ſuch a woful Soul, <hi>Lo-Ruhamah.</hi> The Name which God has given to that Sinner, is, <hi>I will not have Mercy on him.</hi> He has not only ſaid, but he has Sworn in his wrath, that Sinners who Out-ſtand their day of Grace ſhall not enter into his Reſt. When they have Out-ſtood and Out-ſinned their day, No Prayers, nor Cryes, nor Tears will prevail for the obtaining Mercy. God ſaid to the Children of Iſrael, Go up and poſſeſs the Land which I have given you, if you will go now it ſhall be yours: but they rebelled againſt the Commandment of the Lord, and believed him not. And what was the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence? God Swore that not a Man of them all that was in that Rebellion ſhould ever enjoy the good Land. <hi>Notwithſtanding they returned and wept before the Lord, but the Lord would not hearken to their voice, nor give ear unto them,</hi> Deut. 1.45. Thus God in the Goſpel offers Heaven to Sinners on their believing in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, they ſlip the Offer; they neglect the great Salvation; until the day of Salvation is paſt, then they cry but God regards them not. <hi>Therefore it is come to paſs, that as he cried, and they would not hear; ſo they cried and I would not
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:001981_0089_0FBA496FE6676FA8"/>
hear, ſaith the Lord of Hosts,</hi> Zech. 7.12. Shall Sinners that refuſe to hear the Voice of Chriſt in the Goſpel offering Salvation to them, obtain that Salvation! No: He has ſaid, <hi>That none of thoſe men which were bidden ſhall taſte of my Supper,</hi> Luke 14.24.</p>

                     <p>This Doctrine affords matter of juſt and ſad Reproof to ſuch as do not hear the Voice of Chriſt in this their day of Grace. Chriſt ſaid of <hi>Jezebel, I gave her ſpace to Repent and ſhe Repented not,</hi> Rev. 2.21. Alas! It is ſo with many. The Lord has given them Time and many Advantages to be making ſure of the Salvation of their Souls; but they have not done it. Do Men improve their day of Grace? Are there not many who neglect their day, as to all the particulars but now mentioned.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>They do not improve their day of Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity to Soul ſaving Ends and Purpoſes.</hi> They have Health, and it may be Wealth too. That ſhould cauſe them to Seek and Serve the Lord Willingly and Joyfully becauſe of the abundance of all things. They ſhould therefore hear his Voice, and be very Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to him. But the Lord may ſay to them as he did to Jeruſalem: Jer. 22.21. <hi>I ſpake unto thee in thy Proſperity, but thou ſaidſt I will not bear; this has been thy manner
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:001981_0090_0FBA4970DCAD0C98"/>
from thy Youth that thou obeyeſt not my Voice.</hi> They have been like <hi>Jeſurun,</hi> who when he waxed fat was ſo bruitiſh as to kick his feeder. <hi>Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and has forgotten the God that formed thee,</hi> Deut. 32.15, 18. Wretched Sinners, the more mindful God has been of them, the more forgetful have they been of him. And for how long a time? how many days have they forgotten him? Jer. 2.32. <hi>They have forgotten me days without number.</hi> Prayerleſs ones, Hear the Word of the Lord. How many days haſt thou lived, in which thou haſt not Prayed to God? Have they not been days without number! Then thou haſt forgotten God dayes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out number. O fooliſh Creatures and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe! do you thus requite the Lord for all his bleſſings? Doſt thou call thy ſelf a Chriſtian, and yet not Pray to God? Thou has leſs Religion than <hi>Mahometans</hi>; For they Pray more than once every day. A late Writer ſpeaks of two Turks that being at variance, One of them, that he might diſgrace his Adverſary with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Reproach, uttered ſuch words as theſe, <hi>You may ſee what a Wretch that man is, he has not Prayed to God ſo much as once this day.</hi> Are there not thoſe profeſſed Chriſtians here preſent, that have not Prayed to God this day, and it may be not once the laſt Week. Woful forgetters of God they are!</p>

Have we not cauſe to think ſadly on the Parable of the Sower, which ſpeaks of four ſorts of ground, the moſt of them not fruitful. Fruitful hearers of the word are rare in ſome Congregations. They hear and do not hear. It is much to be feared, and the thought is awful, That many who live under the Preaching of the Goſpel, are under that Judicial diſpenſation which <hi>Iſaiah</hi> has Propheſied of, <hi>That their Ears are dull of hearing, and their Eyes they have cloſed, leſt at any time they ſhould ſee with their Eyes, and hear with their Ears, and ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand with their hearts, and be converted,</hi> Matth. 13.15. Is not the Lords day, which is a Market-day for the Soul, by ſome ſpent very Unprofitably? O how much good might Men gain to their Souls in one Lords day, would they carefully improve it? If they would ſpend it Publickly and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately with that Religion which ought to be; in Praying, and in Reading Books of Piety, and in Holy Diſcourſe; ſurely their Souls would thrive in Grace. But do not many ſpend the Evening after the Sabbath ſo Irreligiouſly, as that the Sermons which they heard in the day are in a manner loſt before the next day?</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="89" facs="unknown:001981_0092_0FBA4974F0BE8FB8"/>3. <hi>Do Men hear what the Spirit ſayes</hi>? Do they not quench his Motions? He ſometimes kindles a fire of good Affections in their hearts, but they put it out. They ſtifle Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, and by diſobeying his word reſiſt his Spirit. Act. 7 51. <hi>Te do always reſist the holy Ghoſt.</hi> May not ſuch Sinners fear that the holy Spirit will depart from them: Then wo to thy deſolate Soul. Jer. 6.8. <hi>Be thou inſtructed, O Jeruſalem, leſt my ſoul depart from thee, leſt I make thee deſolate.</hi> If thou ſtill provokeſt the Holy Spirit, it may be he will not only depart from thee, but leave thee to the power of the Evil Spirit. Was it not ſo with <hi>Saul</hi>? 1 Sam. 16.14. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an evil ſpirit from the Lord troubled him.</hi> And was it not ſo with the rebellious Jews? Iſai. 63.10. <hi>They rebelled and vexed his holy Spirit, therefore he was turned to be their enemy.</hi> For the Infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kind Spirit to become an Enemy, is moſt dreadful.</p>

It is poſſible for an Old Sinner to be Converted and Saved. Was not <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> ſuch an One?

Think not to ſay within your ſelves, we will Repent and Turn to God in Jeſus Chriſt, when Old Age has over-taken us. It may be thou ſhalt not live to Age. And you Children hearken. Chriſt ſpeaks to you. Is it not Chriſt that ſayes, <hi>Come you Children hearken to me, I will teach you the fear of the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 34.11.

                     <p>Conſider, 3. <hi>Thy Day may be gone ſuddenly.</hi> It may be thy Sun will ſet at Noon, and the Lord will make the day dark over thee. A ſudden death may put an End to thy day of Grace. If thou haſt hardned thy heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt many Calls of Chriſt, thou haſt cauſe to fear it. Remember that awful Scripture,
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:001981_0097_0FBA4982F6158CF0"/>
Prov. 29.1. <hi>He that being often reproved, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his neck ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed, and that without remedy.</hi> It may be before another Lords day, thou ſhalt be in another World. It may be before this Week is out, thou ſhalt be in thy Grave, and where will thy Soul be then!</p>
                     <p>Do any of you ſay, What would you have us to do, <hi>That we may become Obedient Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to the Word of Chriſt, and that without any delay</hi>?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I wiſh you would <hi>ſeriouſly Think and Conſider.</hi> Thus ſayes the Lord of hoſts, <hi>Conſider your wayes.</hi> You ſay you cannot Convert your ſelves: but you have power to Think ſadly and Conſider of Things, if you will. Does not <hi>David</hi> ſay, <hi>I thought on my wayes, and turned my feet unto thy Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi> Pſal. 119.59. Think ſadly with thy ſelf, What have my ways been? And think what is the way which I am now in? What is my preſent State? Am I in a State of Grace? Am I ſure of that? If I ſhould die this Night? Have I a perſwaſion grounded on the Scripture, That my Soul ſhall be with holy Angels, and with the Spirits of Juſt Men made perfect? And there is another thing, I wiſh you would think of. Think what anguiſh Damned Souls are in, becauſe their day of Grace is paſt. I have heard of a poor Creature that when at the point of Death, uttered ſuch words as theſe, <hi>If I had
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:001981_0098_0FBA49850D8A27F0"/>
Ten thouſand Worlds, I would give them all that I might live one day longer.</hi> Certainly it is ſo with thoſe in Hell. They would give Worlds if they had them to give, that they might have One Sabbath, or One Sermon, or have One Offer of Grace more; One Day to Repent in, with any hopes of finding Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with God. Oh Conſider of it. And Oh that you would go home, and get alone and <hi>Think ſadly on ETERNITY.</hi> It may be one quarter of an hours ſerious Conſideration on it, might be a Means of thy Converſion and Eternal Salvation. That precious Man of God Mr. <hi>Flavel,</hi> in one of his profitable Books, ſpeaks of a Perſon of Quality, who having been abroad with vain Companions until late in the Night, ſhe found a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant who was of a more ſerious Spirit, reading in a good Book; at firſt ſhe deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her, ſaying, Poor Melancholy Soul, What doſt thou poring on a Book: but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a while burſt out into a flood of Tears, Saying to her Servant, As I looked on the Book you was reading, I ſaw that word <hi>ETERNITY:</hi> The thought on that word <hi>ETERNITY,</hi> has broke my very heart within me. I Pray God the ſerious thought of <hi>ETERNITY</hi> may ſavingly Break the hearts of many that hear me this day. Oh Conſider and Think ſadly of it, before thou art gone into <hi>ETERNITY,</hi> whither thou art haſtning; If I die in my
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:001981_0099_0FBA5456F02C2358"/>
Sins and Diſobedience to the Voice of Chriſt, until my day of Grace is paſt, then after I have ſuffered the pains of Hell as many Millions of Years as there is Sands on the Sea ſhore, I ſhall be no nearer to an end of my Miſery, than I was the firſt day that it came upon me: But if I hear the Voice of Chriſt, <hi>To day,</hi> All my Sins will be forgiven, and I ſhall be happy throughout the never-ending days of Eternity; for Chriſt has ſaid, <hi>The Righteous ſhall go into Life Eternal.</hi>

                  <head>The Preface.</head>
                  <p>THE Reaſon of my committing this <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> (ſuch as it is) to the <hi>Preſs,</hi> is, not only that I might gratify the deſire of the worthy Perſon whoſe <hi>Ordination</hi> occaſioned the Preaching of it (&amp; of many others) but that beſides what I have Written many Years ago in the Preface before bleſſed Mr. <hi>Mitchels</hi> Life, I might leave my <hi>dying Advice</hi> to the <hi>Students</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> which I hope may be of ſome uſe alſo to thoſe who are or ſhall belong to the <hi>Academical School</hi> which is now Erecting in a Neighbour Colony.</p>
                  <p>It is mentioned in the Sermon Emitted herewith, that our very Learned <hi>Preſident,</hi> the Aged &amp; Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Mr. <hi>Chauncey</hi> in a Diſcourſe on <hi>Amos 2.11.</hi> delivered many Years ſince, at the Lecture in <hi>Cambridge</hi> the day after the <hi>Commencement,</hi> inſiſted on the neceſſity of that which is called <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Learning,</hi> to make an able Miniſter of the New-Teſtament. Likewiſe that Eminent Divine Mr. <hi>Sydrack Sympſon</hi> at the Commencement, <hi>Anno 1653.</hi> Preached a Sermon to the ſame Effect on <hi>2 King. 6.1, 2.</hi> to the <hi>Univerſity Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in Old <hi>Cambridge.</hi> Alſo Mr. <hi>Edward Reyner,</hi> a Reverend &amp; Learned Miniſter of the Congregational Perſwaſion, in <hi>Lincoln,</hi> has an Elaborate &amp; Judicious Diſcourſe, ſhewing that Knowledge in the Liberal Arts and Original Tongues is very neceſſary to make an accompliſhed Divine. And if ſo, then <hi>Univerſities</hi> &amp; <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges</hi> are not unneceſſary.</p>
                  <p>It is true, that our firſt <hi>Reformers</hi> complain of the <hi>Univerſities</hi> which were in <hi>Europe</hi> in
<pb facs="unknown:001981_0102_0FBA545F236D4A48"/>
thoſe days, as the <hi>Chairs of Peſtilence. Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff</hi> calls them the <hi>Synagogues of Satan;</hi> and <hi>Satapras Antichriſti,</hi> Antichriſts Lieutenants. <hi>Luther</hi> (according to his wonted vehemency) ſays, They are no other than <hi>the Pits of Hell out of which came that Smoak of the bottomleſs Pit which has darkned the Sun &amp; the Air</hi>: And that <hi>Hell is Paved with the</hi> bald <hi>Sculs of Friars,</hi> who lived in Colleges. The Martyr <hi>Tindal</hi> (who has been called the <hi>Apoſtle of England</hi>) complains of them for ſetting up <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> (a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, who maintains many damnable Opinions) to be of equal Authority with <hi>Chriſt. Melancthon</hi> relates that there was a Preacher in the Univerſity of <hi>Tubingen</hi> who took his Text out of <hi>Ariſtotles Ethicks,</hi> inſtead of the Bible.</p>
                  <p>Such as theſe are the Univerſities which our Reformers have Condemned, in which there was no true Religion, nor ſolid Learning taught, but Heatheniſm &amp; Idolatry, with the Rixations of thoſe called <hi>Schoolmen</hi> who were much worſe than their Maſter <hi>Peter Lombard. Calvin</hi> calls their Scholaſtical Divinity, <hi>Diabolicam ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem rixandi.</hi> Another Reformer ſays, He that ſees a Scholaſtical Theologue, <hi>ſees the Seven deadly Sins.</hi> It is not to be wondred at if ſuch Men as <hi>Weigelius,</hi> (whom the Excellently Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Dr. <hi>Arrowſmith, Regius Profeſſor</hi> in the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge</hi> has taken to task) ſhould declare against <hi>Colleges,</hi> but it is very strange, that any Maſter of a College ſhould write against <hi>all Univerſities</hi> whatſoever, and then produce the Reformers mention'd to Patronize him. Yet this has been done by Mr. <hi>Dell</hi> the
<pb facs="unknown:001981_0103_0FBA5460D2554490"/>
Quondam Maſter of <hi>Convil &amp; Cajus</hi> College in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> not conſidering that <hi>the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> has like Moſes's Rod turned thoſe Serpents into a Paſtoral Staff, and that <hi>Luther,</hi> and other Reformers have been ſtrenuous aſſerters of the uſefulneſs &amp; neceſſity of ſuch Societies, if duly regulated. It has been by the bleſſing of God on <hi>Proteſtant Univerſities</hi> that the true Religion has been Continued, and Propagated among the Nations: out of them have riſen thoſe who have been the glory of the Places &amp; of the Age in which they lived. In our own Nation how great a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing have the two Univerſities of <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge</hi> been in the former Ages? It has been ſaid of them as of <hi>Leah</hi> &amp; <hi>Rachel, which two did build the houſe of Iſrael.</hi> And out of the three Univerſities in <hi>Scotland,</hi> many Men of Renown have iſſued forth, too many to be enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated. Nor is the most famous <hi>Uſher</hi> the only famous Man that has had his Education in the College at <hi>Dublin.</hi> There are five Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities in the <hi>Reformed Belgium.</hi> How many great Instruments of Good to the Church of God have they produced? So among the Reformed in <hi>France,</hi> and in <hi>Germany,</hi> and in <hi>Denmark?</hi> And ſome out of the Univerſity of <hi>Upſal</hi> in <hi>Sweedland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When our Fathers on the account of <hi>Pure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Undefiled,</hi> came into this <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Deſert,</hi> their care was that Religion might not die with them, or continue but for One Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. To prevent that, they built a <hi>College,</hi> that a Learned Youth might be Educated under the Inſpection of a Preſident and Tutors; which
<pb facs="unknown:001981_0104_0FBA546221BBF898"/>
owes its Foundation to a Godly Non-conformiſt Miniſter, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>John Harvard,</hi> who by his <hi>Will</hi> bequeathed the one half of his Eſtate, for the Encouragement of that Publick &amp; Pious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; for which his Memory is and ever will be bleſſed: and it is perpetuated by the Name of <hi>Harvard College</hi> in <hi>Cambridge.</hi> GOD has made it a fruitful Mother, ſince not only the Churches in <hi>New-England</hi> have been ſupplied from thence with Excellent Preachers, diverſe of them Eminent Men of God, but moreover, ſome who had their Education there, have Preached the Goſpel in <hi>England, Scotland, Ireland,</hi> and in <hi>Holland.</hi> It would be ſad, if ever that Society ſhould degenerate from its Primitive Inſtitution. <hi>Corruptio optimi peſſima.</hi> The Lord forbid that they ſhould ever ſo diviate from the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of their Pious Founder, as that the overthrow of the Churches ſhall proceed from thence, as has been related concerning the Churches in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> that the Corruption of their Schools proved fatal to them.</p>
                  <p>I rejoyce to ſee a peculiar <hi>Talent</hi> put into the hands of One ſo Qualified &amp; Hopeful as Mr. <hi>Appleton</hi> is, to be Servicable to the Churches of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Dr. <hi>Preſton</hi> choſe rather to be a Preacher in <hi>Cambridge</hi> than elſe where, becauſe there he had an Opportunity (by the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Chriſt) to be the Inſtrument of Converting thoſe, who might probably be the Converters of many others. The good Lord grant that in our <hi>Cambridge</hi> it may be ſo.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>IN the Preceding Verſe, the Apoſtle declares, that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt has given to his Church a variety of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Officers. Some that were Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary and Temporary, and are long ſince ceaſed, viz. <hi>Apoſtles, Prophets, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts.</hi> An Apoſtle was one that had ſeen Chriſt and received a Commiſſion immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from him. The Prophets here ſpoken of are not the Prophets of the Old, but of the New Teſtament; ſuch as <hi>Agabus,</hi> and ſome others mentioned in the Acts of the Apoſtles. An Evangeliſt was one that did accompany the Apoſtles, and Aſſiſt them in Preaching the Goſpel. Such were <hi>Mark, Luke, Timothy, Titus, Silas, Apollos,</hi> &amp;c. But beſides theſe, Chriſt has given to his Church
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:001981_0106_0FBA5471F9008F50"/>
a Miniſtry which is to be perpetual. A ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſtanding Office, Namely that of <hi>Paſtors and Teachers.</hi> It is Obſervable, that it is not ſaid <hi>ſome</hi> Paſtors, and <hi>ſome</hi> Teachers, as it was ſaid <hi>ſome</hi> Apoſtles, and <hi>ſome</hi> Prophets, which ſeems to intimate that the Paſtoral and the Teaching Office are the ſame. Every Paſtor is to be a Teacher, and every Teacher that is ſo in reſpect of Office is to feed his Flock, and is in that reſpect a Paſtor. In this Verſe the Work of the Miniſtry is deſcribed from that which is the principal end of it. Some ſuppoſe a <hi>Trajection</hi> in the words, and that the Verſe runs thus. <hi>For the Work of the Miniſtry, for the perfecting the Saints, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt.</hi> That's the End for which Chriſt has inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Ordinance of the Miniſtry. In the next Verſe, The Miniſtry is deſcribed from the duration of it. It ſhall continue <hi>until we all come into the unity of the Faith.</hi> The Elect of God are diſperſed throughout the World in Places very diſtant from one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; but the day will come when they ſhall <hi>all come together,</hi> and then they ſhall be of <hi>One Faith,</hi> not only as to the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Articles of Religion, but in leſſer points alſo. In a future World it will be ſo, where there will be no need of a Miniſtry, and until then, it ſhall continue. From the Words in Conſideration with the Context, the Doctrinal Truth before us, is,

                  <p>The Scripture gives it that Name. When <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were to be <hi>Ordained Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers</hi> of the Goſpel to the Gentiles, the holy Ghoſt ſaid, Separate them <hi>for the Work</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I have called them. And a divine Work it is. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of <hi>Timothy, He work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the work of the Lord, as I alſo do,</hi> 1 Cor. 16.10. On which account it is that a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular reſpect is due to thoſe that are ſo em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. 1 Theſ. 5.13. <hi>Eſteem them very highly in Love for their works ſake.</hi> A work which cannot be done without Labour. 1 Tim. 5.17. <hi>Let Elders that rule well, be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted worthy of double honour, eſpecially they</hi> who Labour <hi>in the Word and Doctrine.</hi> That double honour intends, an honourable Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; therefore in the next Verſe it is ſaid, <hi>The Labourer is worthy of his reward.</hi> Indeed the Labour of the Body is not ſo much in this as in ſome other Callings; but the Labour of the Mind is that which is the moſt Conſuming; the Labour of the head and heart is moſt tireſome. Therefore <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>

                  <p>The Enquiry now will be, <hi>What it the Work of the Miniſtry?</hi> What is the Work which the Miniſters of the Goſpel are to be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about?</p>

For if any one of thoſe Souls miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry through the Miniſters negligence or unfaithfulneſs, he muſt anſwer for it. Their blood will be required at his hand. Ezek. 33.6. <hi>His blood will I require at the Watchmans hands.</hi> Who is that Watchman? Verſe 7. <hi>Son of Man, I have ſet thee a Watchman to the houſe of Iſrael; thou ſhalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me; if thou dost not ſpeak to warn the wicked from his ways, he ſhall die in his iniquity, but his blood will I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire at thine hand.</hi> Who can think of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the blood of Souls layed to his charge, without trembling at the thought of it?</p>

Joh. 3.29. Chriſt is the Bridegroom, his Miniſters are ſaid to be his Friends; for it is their work to woo, and if poſſible to win Souls for Chriſt. King <hi>David</hi> was not an ordinary Miniſter, nevertheleſs a Miniſter of God he was; he was a Prophet, and he ſayes, <hi>I will teach Tranſgreſſors thy ways, and Sinners ſhall be converted to thee,</hi> Pſal. 51.13. <hi>Levi</hi> did as became his relation, when the law of Truth was in his Mouth, and <hi>he did turn many from iniquity,</hi> Mal. 2.6. As for the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Preachers of the Goſpel, this was their main deſign, and God made their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours wonderfully Succeſsful. Acts 11.21. <hi>The hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the Lord, Peter</hi> had the Jews for his more peculiar Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, the Apoſtleſhip of the Circumciſion was committed to him, and the Lord taught Effectually by him. We read of near upon three thouſand Jews Converted by one Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon which he Preached at Jeruſalem, <hi>Act.</hi> 2 41. <hi>Paul</hi> endeavoured the Converſion of the Gentiles; Chriſt from Heaven having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him a Commiſſion to that work, ſaying, <hi>I ſend thee to the Gentiles to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkneſs to light and from the power of Satan unto God,</hi> Act. 26.18. And he was an happy Inſtrument of Converting we know not how many thouſands. The Miraculous Succeſs of the Apoſtles and their Succeſſors in Converting the Gentile World was Propheſied of by <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> who ſayes,

That <hi>Fiſhers ſhall ſtand from</hi> Engedi <hi>even unto</hi> Eneglaim, and ſpread forth nets, and the fiſh taken in the net, would be <hi>exceeding many,</hi> Ezek. 47.10. <hi>Engedi</hi> was at the South-weſt end of the dead Sea, <hi>Eneglaim</hi> was at the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt end of it; there were to be fiſhers from one end of the dead Sea to the other. The dead Sea (the Lake of Sodom) was an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of the Gentile World, who were all dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins. Miniſters are Fiſhers. Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples, I will make you <hi>Fiſhers of Men.</hi> They muſt fiſh for Souls, and ſpread the Net of the Goſpel that they may take Souls for Chriſt. In all Ages of the World there will be ſome to be Converted, which is one reaſon why there muſt be Miniſters of the Goſpel to the End of the World, becauſe in every Age there will be ſome to be Converted; and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the Word is the ordinary Means of Converſion. Rom. 10.7. <hi>Faith comes by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and hearing by the Word of God:</hi> And it is ſaid, How ſhall they believe on him of whom they have not heard? and how ſhall they hear without a Preacher? and how ſhall there be a Preacher except there is one ſent? When there are Believers, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt are uſually the Inſtruments by whom they are made ſuch. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. Who is Paul, &amp; who is Apollos, but <hi>Ministers by whom you believed, even as the Lord gave to every one.</hi> There are few Congregations but there are ſome Unconverted ones therein. It is the
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:001981_0111_0FBA5483CC3C1480"/>
Miniſters duty to apply himſelf accordingly. It is a vain Opinion which ſome have, that the Paſtor of a Church is only to Endeavour the Edification of Saints, but not the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of Sinners; he ought to do both, as the next words to my Text intimate, <hi>For the Edifying the Body of Christ.</hi> When a Sinner is Converted, the Body of Chriſt is Edifyed, there is a New Member added to his Church which is his Body; another living Stone is layed in that Sacred building. And truly what greater Service can any Miniſter, or any Man in the World do for Chriſt, than to make thoſe that have been ſlaves to Sin and Satan, to become faithful Subjects in Chriſts holy Kingdom, to the Eternal Salvation of their Souls. <hi>He that Converts a Sinner ſhall ſave a Soul from death.</hi> Jam. 5.20. And what can any Man do that will be more for his own Joy &amp; Comfort? I have often thought of a Paſſage which a renowned Hiſtorian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates concerning Dr. <hi>Williams</hi> the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>York,</hi> who had been before that the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and Lord Keeper, and ſuſtained other Places of Honour and Dignity; when a Miniſter came to him for <hi>Ordination,</hi> he ſaid to him, <hi>I have paſſed thorough many Places of honour in Church and State, more than any of my Order in</hi> England; <hi>could I be aſſured that by my Preaching I had Convered one Soul, I ſhould have more comfort in that than in all the Honours and Offices that have been bestowed on me.</hi> Without doubt there are ſome who
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:001981_0112_0FBA54855FBC1988"/>
will have a greater degree of Glory conferred on them at the laſt day, than others ſhall. Among theſe faithful Miniſters of Chriſt will be found, who have been the happy Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Converting many Souls to God. Witneſs that bleſſed Scripture: Dan. 12.3. <hi>They that be</hi> Teachers (ſo the Hebrew word. <hi>Hammaſchilim</hi> there uſed) <hi>ſhall ſhine as the brightneſs of the Firmament, and they that turn many to righteouſneſs as the Stars for ever and ever.</hi> A <hi>Prophets reward</hi> is mentioned as that which has a Specialty on it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.41.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>It belongs to a Miniſter of the Goſpel to Endeavour the Spiritual Edification of thoſe that are Converted, that they may be built up in their most holy Faith.</hi> It is not enough to Sow the Seed of the Word, but it muſt be watered, then it may be hoped that God will make it fruitful. 1 Cor. 3.6. <hi>I have planted, Apollos watered, God gave the increaſe. Paul</hi> was the Planter of a Church in <hi>Corinth.</hi> They were his Converts. He was Inſtrumental in Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Seed of Grace in their Souls. He left <hi>Apollos</hi> with them, who continued Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching to them and by thoſe waterings built them up in further degrees of Faith and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. A Paſtor of a Church muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the Edification of his People, by build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them up in Knowledge. It is a ſingular bleſſing when they have a Paſtor furniſhed with ſuch gifts as enable him to do it. Jer. 3.15. <hi>I will give them Paſtors according to my own
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:001981_0113_0FBA5486EAA897E0"/>
heart, which ſhall feed them with Knowledge and Underſtanding.</hi> The Miniſtry of the Word is appointed, not only that ſo Grace may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun where it is not, but that they who have Grace, may grow in Grace. 1 Pet. 2.2. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the ſincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby.</hi> Miniſters muſt Endeavour the Confirmation and Eſtabliſhment of their Hearers in the truth and holy ways of the Lord. This alſo did the Primitive Preachers of the Goſpel. <hi>Act.</hi> 14.22. They Preached the Goſpel, and taught many, <hi>Confirming the Souls of the Diſciples, Exhorting them to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in the Faith.</hi> No Man was more Labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous herein than the Apoſtle <hi>Paul:</hi> He went through <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> in which Places he had Converted many, and gathered Churches, <hi>Confirming the Churches,</hi> Act. 15.41. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Flocks are in danger by Wolves. Falſe Teachers who bring in damnable Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, are ſuch. It is incumbent on their Paſtors to defend them againſt the cunning Craftineſs of theſe Men who lie in wait to deceive; and to confirm them, that they may not be carried about with every wind of doctrine. Sometimes Believers meet with ſore temptation, by which they are apt to be diſcouraged: Then a word of comfort may be much to their Edification. <hi>Comfort ye, Comfort ye my People, ſpeak comfortably to Jeruſalem.</hi> It may be a ſeaſonable word from the Mouth of a Paſtor to the tempted in his Flock who ſit in darkneſs and ſee no light,
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:001981_0114_0FBA548D0E539270"/>
will have a wonderful reviving Efficacy in it, to ſtrengthen their Faith, and eſtabliſh their hope in God, who has <hi>Created the fruit of the Lips, Peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>In order here-unto Miniſters ought to be Diligent and Labourious in Preaching the word of God.</hi> They ſhould come to their People with well ſtudied Sermons. 2 Tim. 2.15. <hi>Study to ſhew thy ſelf approved unto God, a workman that needeth not be aſhamed, rightly dividing the word of Truth.</hi> As the Prieſts were to divide the Sacrifice that every one might have their ſhare, ſo the Miniſter muſt apply Comfort to whom that does belong, and Terror to whom that does belong. He that will ſhow himſelf a Workman that needs not be aſhamed, muſt ſtudy for it. There is more than a little contained in that Apoſtolical Injunction: 2 Tim. 4.2. <hi>Preach the Word, be inſtant in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon. Preach.</hi> The Greek Word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, ſignifies to Proclaim like an <hi>Herald,</hi> publickly and with a loud Voice. Miniſters of the Goſpel are Chriſts Heralds, they muſt Publickly and Earneſtly declare what is the Command of their Lord and Maſter, and <hi>be inſtant,</hi> be in good Earneſt. The Lord ſaid to his Prophet, <hi>Cry aloud,</hi> do as becomes an Herald, <hi>Spare not, lift up thy Voice like a Trumpet</hi>; it condemns a cold, dull, lifeleſs way of Preaching. <hi>In ſeaſon.</hi> If a Miniſter is on a ſubject which People are willing to hear of, that's <hi>in ſeaſon</hi>;
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:001981_0115_0FBA549077C2D760"/>
if on a ſubject which they have no Mind to hear, that's out of the Seaſon to them: but whether they will hear or forbear, the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher muſt faithfully declare the Meſſages which the Lord has ſent him with. What is <hi>Preaching?</hi> It is an <hi>Opening, and Applying of the Scriptures.</hi> To ſearch the Scriptures is every Mans duty, but the Miniſters duty more than any Mans in the World. <hi>Search</hi> them. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as <hi>Miners</hi> do. There are rich Mines, in the Scripture, there is Gold and Pearls in thoſe Mines, but we muſt dig and dive that ſo we may come at them. No Man can be better Employed. Miniſters ſhould be Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate in their Sermons. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayes, <hi>The Preacher ſought to find out acceptable words,</hi> Eccl. 12.10. Men that come into the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, and utter whatever comes next, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Premeditation or Dijudication, do not <hi>ſeek</hi> to find out acceptable words. There was a Man of ſome Name and Fame, who had an unhappy deſign of introducing <hi>Ex tempore</hi> Preaching as well as <hi>Ex tempore</hi> Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; And being a Learned Man he would make the attempt in the Univerſity Church in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> but the Lord rebuked him. One that was there preſent informed me that he was at a <hi>Nonplus,</hi> and in perfect confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Confeſſing his raſhneſs, and warning the Students not to do the like, but to Study their Sermons before they Preached them. Moreover, Miniſters of the Goſpel ought not to Preach only Verbally, but by their Lives
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:001981_0116_0FBA54917AD09460"/>
and Converſations. They ſhould <hi>Live Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</hi> A Miniſter ſhould be able to ſay to his People, as Gideon ſaid to his Souldiers, He ſaid to them, <hi>Look on me and do likewiſe, it ſhall be as I do, ſo ſhall you do,</hi> Judg. 7.17. Thus ſhould a Miniſter be able to ſpeak to his People, do not only as I ſay, but as I do, obſerve my Life and Practice, and do you Live and Practice as I do, my humane frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Excepted. The Apoſtle ſaid to his Corinthians, <hi>Be ye followers of me,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.15. Followers of my Doctrine, and followers of my Example.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>To be much in Prayer is the Work and Duty of the Miniſters of God in a ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi> They are to be as Gods Mouth to his People, ſo his Peoples Mouth to him. The Prieſt was to bleſs in the Name of the Lord, and to be offering Incenſe daily. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſaid, <hi>We will give our ſelves continually to Prayer and to the Miniſtry of the Word,</hi> Act. 6.4. They that are called to the Miniſtry of the Word, are to give themſelves to Prayer, which implies frequency as well as conſtancy therein. Before they Compoſe their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, they ſhould Pray over them. Let them Pray Sermons down from Heaven. It is reported of Martyr <hi>Bradford</hi> that he Study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Kneeling. And when they have Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their Sermons they ſhould Pray over them again, that a bleſſing from God may make them Succeſsful and Effectual for the good
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:001981_0117_0FBA54972C1F93F8"/>
of Souls. And they have cauſe to be much in Prayer for their own Souls, that they may obtain Mercy to be faithful in the diſcharge of their Miniſtry. It is a dreadful charge which is impoſed on them. One of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients ſaith of the Miniſtry, That it is <hi>Onus humeris Angelicis formidandum,</hi> a charge and burden which the Shoulders of Angels might tremble to come under it. Another Ancient ſayes, It is a wonder that a Miniſter ſhould get to Heaven. Such Mortification to the World, ſuch Self-denial, ſuch Impartiality, ſuch Faithfulneſs, ſuch Exemplary Holineſs is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired and expected of them, as that it is a wonder that any of that Order ſhould be Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. A ſmall error in ſuch an one, is great by reaſon of the Sacredneſs of his Office. Under the Law there was as great a Sacrifice to be offered for the Prieſt as for the whole Congregation. Are they not then concerned to be alwayes Praying? It was <hi>Auſtins</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, that when the Meſſenger of Death ſhould be ſent for him, it might find him either Preaching or Praying. Miniſters are to Pray as for themſelves, ſo for and with particular Perſons in their Flock, if they need Prayer and deſire it. Jam. 5.15. <hi>Is any ſick among you? Let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray over him. Auſtin</hi> (whom I mentioned but now) would not refuſe to go to the meaneſt Sick Perſon in his Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if they deſired it, but otherwiſe he would ſeldom go to any, becauſe he would not
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:001981_0118_0FBA549A6EF178A8"/>
prevent them from doing that which is their duty, <hi>to Call for their Elders,</hi> to Pray over them. And a Paſtor of a Church ought to Pray continually for his whole Flock. 'Tis his duty to bring them to God every Day, and every Night. How is it poſſible that that Miniſter ſhould have Grace in his Soul that can, that dare live one Day or one Night without bringing his Flock to GOD for his bleſſing when Praying for his own Soul? The Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid, <hi>God forbid that I ſhould ſin in ceaſing to pray for you, but I will teach you the good and the right way,</hi> 1 Sam. 12.23. And truly faithful Miniſters of God may be Encouraged to Pray, for that there is a great Efficacy in their Prayers, their Prayers have a greater power with God than the Prayers of other Men, ſince they Pray not only by vertue of the rule of Charity, but <hi>Ex Officio</hi> by vertue of an Office. We find in the Scripture that God has manifeſted a Special regard to the Prayers of ſuch of his Servants. Pſal. 99.6. <hi>Moſes and Aaron among his Prieſts, and Samuel among them that call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Name; they called upon the Lord, and he anſwered them.</hi> Moſes is mentioned among the Prieſts, becauſe he did the work of a Prieſt before the Prieſthood was ſettled and confined to Aarons Family, and after that was a powerful Interceſſor for the People. <hi>Samuel</hi> was a Prophet. We ſee that the Lord has a great regard to the Prayers of thoſe that are his Prieſts and his Prophets. Wherefore
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:001981_0119_0FBA549EC36E6330"/>
it was ſaid to <hi>Abimeleck</hi> when he was Sick and in danger of death, the Prayer of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet might ſave his Life. Gen. 2.7. <hi>He is a Prophet, he ſhall pray for thee, and thou ſhalt live.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee that Miniſters of the Goſpel have a Work to attend, and what that Work is. I might have added, that there is <hi>Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> (as well as doing) <hi>Work</hi> which they muſt expect a peculiar ſhare in. When Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution ariſeth they muſt look to be ſet in fore-front of the hotteſt battel. It is the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one of the Ancients, <hi>Non eſt Minister Chriſti, qui non eſt ad mille mortes Paratus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We proceed to a Second Propoſition, which is,
<q>That there are ſome who are by the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt called to this Work.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>When it is ſaid, That <hi>Chriſt has given ſuch to his Church,</hi> it implies that they have a Call from him to accept of that Office, and to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the work of it. It is true, that there are ſome who undertake the Work without a Call. Such were the falſe Prophets in the Church of Iſrael, of whom the Lord ſayes, <hi>I have not ſent theſe Prophets, yet they ran, I have not ſpoken to them, yet they Propheſied,</hi> Jer. 23.21. But this ought not to be. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſayes, <hi>No man takes this honour to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi>; that is to ſay, No Man that does as he ought to do, <hi>but he that is called of God as
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:001981_0120_0FBA549F9C8A3E70"/>
was Aaron,</hi> Heb. 5.4. It is not good to Uſurp the Miniſterial Office. All that are Called there-unto have their Call from God and from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1 1. Paul an Apoſtle <hi>not of men, neither by man, but by Jeſus Christ, and God the Father.</hi> The Apoſtles, (excepting <hi>Matthias</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi>) had their Call immediately from Chriſt without any Man being concerned in their Call; <hi>Paul</hi> peculiarly had his Call to the Apoſtleſhip from Chriſt ſince his Aſcention to the Right hand of God in Heaven. Paſtors and Teachers are not thus Called. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they are Called <hi>by Men,</hi> their Office and Miniſterial Authority is not <hi>of Men.</hi> No Man, nor all the Men in the World, have power to make any Officer in the Church beſides what Chriſt himſelf has Inſtituted. Men commonly ſay, Such an One is <hi>our</hi> Miniſter, but it would be more proper to ſay, He is <hi>Gods Miniſter,</hi> and <hi>Chriſts Miniſter.</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.2. Timotheus our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>and Miniſter of God.</hi> 1 Tim. 4.6. <hi>A good Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Your Paſtor has his Call <hi>by you,</hi> but not <hi>of you</hi> as the Inſtitutor of it. <hi>Archippus</hi> was a Teacher in the Church of <hi>Coloſſians.</hi> To him it was ſaid, <hi>Take heed to the Miniſtry which thou haſt received in the Lord that thou fulfil it.</hi> Fulfilling the Miniſtry implies doing whatever belongs to that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, Praying, Preaching, Governing, Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing the diſcipline of Chriſt, adminiſtring the Sacraments of the New Teſtament.
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:001981_0121_0FBA54A11D527458"/>
The Miniſter that neglects any part of his Miniſterial Work does not fulfil it. <hi>Archip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pas</hi> received this Miniſtry <hi>in the Lord,</hi> i. e. by and from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. It was in the Lords Name and by vertue of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, that he was called unto and intruſted with a Sacred Miniſtry, which he was under the Solemneſt Obligation Conſcientiouſly to fulfil it.</p>
                  <p>Here the Enquiry will be.</p>
                  <q>Who are Called of the Lord to the Work of the Miniſtry?</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> In Order to a Lawful and Regular Call to this Work ſeveral things are requiſite.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Ministerial Gifts and Qualifications are neceſſary.</hi> He muſt be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, One that ſhall have an Ability and Promptitude to Teach. One called to that work ſhould have more Wiſdom and Knowledge than what the generality of Believers have attained unto. Eccl. 12.9. <hi>Becauſe the Preacher was wiſe he taught the people Knowledge.</hi> Chriſt ſpeaking of thoſe whom he would ſend to Preach the Goſpel, ſays, <hi>I will ſend you wiſe men,</hi> Matth. 23.34. And <hi>Ezra</hi> ſent ſome to <hi>Iddo</hi> at <hi>Caſiphia</hi> where there was a College, or Company of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites over whom it ſeems <hi>Iddo Preſided,</hi> that they ſhould bring Miniſters for the Houſe of God, and 'tis ſaid that by the good hand of God upon them, <hi>they brought a Man of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi>
                     <pb n="120" facs="unknown:001981_0122_0FBA54A2C6C542D8"/>
Ezra. 8.17, 18. A Miniſter ſhould be ſuch an One. He ſhould have in his head and heart a Treaſure of Scripture Knowledge. Matth. 13.52 <hi>Every Scribe which is inſtructed to the Kingdom of Heaven, is like unto a Man that is an houſeholder, which brings forth out of his treaſure things new and old.</hi> That Man who Preacheth Salvation by the alone Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of a Crucified Chriſt, and withal Teacheth Obedience to the Moral Law, brings forth things new and old. 'Tis ſaid, <hi>The Prieſts lips ſhall preſerve knowledge, and they ſhould ſeek the Law at his Mouth,</hi> Mal. 2.7. And in another Scripture it is ſaid, <hi>Ask the Priest concerning the Law,</hi> Hag. 2.11. It is neceſſary then that he ſhould have a greater Underſtanding in the Law of God than others have. Every Man is not qualified to be a Publick Interpreter of the Divine Law. <hi>An Interpreter is one of a thouſand,</hi> Job 33.23.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Where there is a Call to the Miniſtry there is an Inclination to Serve God in that Work.</hi> There have been thoſe who have been ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with admirable Knowledge and other Miniſterial qualifications, but no inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to improve their Talents in that Work, they chuſe rather to Serve God and Chriſt in ſome other Calling. A ſign that the Lord does not Call them to the Work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry. Not but that a Man who has a Call thereunto, may from a ſenſe of the awfulneſs of the Work, and his own inſufficiency be
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:001981_0123_0FBA54A959869778"/>
for ſome time very unwilling to ingage in it, as we ſee in the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> God ſaid to him, I have <hi>Ordained</hi> thee to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to the Nations; What me! (ſayes he) I am a Child I cannot ſpeak. I am a Young Man, and not fit to undertake ſo great an Office; but God by his power over-came the unwillingneſs of the Prophet, Wherefore he ſayes, <hi>Thou art ſtronger than I, and haſt prevailed,</hi> Jer. 20.7. Thus if God calls a Man to the Miniſtry, he will over power him, and make him buckle to the work, yea, to deſire it. 1 Tim. 3.1. <hi>If a man deſire the Office of a Biſhop, has deſireth a good work</hi>; That is to ſay, an excellent and an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble work. But this deſire ought to proceed not from Carnal but Spiritual Motives. Not becauſe he would have the honour of ſuch an Office; not for a Benefice, as too many take up the Miniſtry only to make a Liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of it. Which does not agree with the Apoſtles Exhortation, 1 Pet. 5.2. <hi>Feed the flock of God, taking the over-ſight thereof, not by conſtraint, but willingly, not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind.</hi> He does not do his work of a <hi>ready mind,</hi> who is driven to it by neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, or drawn to it by Covetouſneſs. When an earneſt deſire to glorify God, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Intereſt of Chriſts Kingdom, and the Salvation of Souls ſhall incline a Man to deſire the work of the Miniſtry, it is a ſign that Chriſt has called him to it.</p>

                     <pb n="122" facs="unknown:001981_0124_0FBA54AC5082E9D8"/>3. <hi>Mutual Election is that which does Eſſentiate the relation of a Paſtor to this or that particular Church.</hi> No Church ought to have a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

                     </gap> free choice. No <hi>Patron</hi> or <hi>Prelate</hi> may do it. The Apoſtles notwithſtanding their having an <hi>Amplitude,</hi> and <hi>Plenitude</hi> of Church power, would not do it. They left it to the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Diſciples to chooſe their Deacons. The Electing of a Paſtor is of far greater Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore no Church ſhould be deprived of that Privilege in which the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of their Souls is ſo much concerned. When an Apoſtle was to be choſen to joyn with thoſe whom Chriſt himſelf had choſen, <hi>Peter</hi> and the other Apoſtles, Call-upon the Brethren in the Church at Jeruſalem to chooſe One ſuitably qualified. Accordingly they Nominated two, and then caſt Lots which ſhould be the Perſon. And the Lot feel upon <hi>Matthias,</hi> Act. 1.26. Now the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is very ſtrong, that if the Brethren in this Leading Example might chooſe an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Officer, they have power to Elect an ordinary Paſtor. It is ſaid in Act. 14.23. <hi>When they had ordained the Elders in every Church, and Prayed with Fasting, they commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to the Lord, on whom they believed.</hi> That the Original Word <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="123" facs="unknown:001981_0125_0FBA54B500F42400"/>
Church by lifting up of their hands. A learned Knight [Sir <hi>Norton Knatchbull</hi>] in his Critical Animadverſions on the New Teſtament, has clearly demonſtrated. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more evident than that in the Primitive times, the Privilege of chooſing their own Paſtor did belong to the Church to which he was to Miniſter. <hi>Ignatius</hi> in his Epiſtle to the Church then in <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> ſayes, it belonged to them to chooſe their Paſtor. The <hi>Nicene Council</hi> in a Synodal Letter to the Churches in <hi>Africa,</hi> adviſed them to chooſe Orthodox Paſtors inſtead of <hi>Arians; Cyprian</hi> ſayes, <hi>Plebs maxime habet poteſtatem dignos ſacerdotes Eligendi,</hi> &amp;c. It was a long time before this Privilege was wreſted out of the hands of particular Churches by Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Antichriſtian Uſurpation. Our <hi>United Brethren</hi> in London, concur in this Article, <hi>That ordinarily none ſhall be Ordained to the Work of the Miniſtry, but ſuch as are Called and Choſen thereunto by a particular Church.</hi> But it is neceſſary that this Election ſhould be Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual. Altho' a Church chooſe a Man to be their Paſtor, Except he does alſo chooſe them to be his Flock, or accept of their Election, he does not become their Paſtor. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding every Church has power to chuſe their own Paſtor, our <hi>United Brethred</hi> declare, <hi>That in ſo weighty a Matter as chuſing a Paſtor, we judge it ordinarily neceſſary, that every ſuch Church conſul: and adviſe with the Paſtors of Neighbouring Congregations.</hi>

So was <hi>Joſhua</hi> Ordained <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor. <hi>Numb.</hi> 27.18, 19. The Lord ſaid to Moſes, <hi>Take Joſhua and lay thine hand upon him ſet him before Eleazar and before all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and give him a charge in their fight.</hi> And thus have Miniſters of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment been ſet apart for the work of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. The firſt <hi>Laying on of hands</hi> that ever was practiſed out of the Land of Iſrael, was that in the Church at <hi>Antioch,</hi> but now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, which may therefore be looked upon as Preſidential to the Gentile Churches. Some have eſteemed that Ceremony ſo Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the Call of a Miniſter as to judge thoſe that have it not to be no true Miniſters of the Goſpel. I dare not ſay ſo. For I know full well that not only thoſe of the Congregational Perſwaſion, but the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Brethren do many of them ſay other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. When that Queſtion was propoſed by K. James I. to the General Aſſembly of the Church in Scotland, <hi>Is he a lawful Pastor who
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:001981_0127_0FBA54B85AD5B0A0"/>
wants impoſition of hands?</hi> Their anſwer was, <hi>Impoſition of hands is not Eſſential, but Ceremonial and indifferent, in the Admiſſion of a Paſtor.</hi> Several Synods of the Reformed Churches in France ſay the very ſame. So the Dutch Churches, and thoſe in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in Germany. Yet there are who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain not only that the impoſing of hands as Eſſential to the being of a Miniſter, but that it muſt be by Epiſcopal hands, otherwiſe that the Ordination is Null and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter that has received it, no true Miniſter. A moſt uncharitable Opinion which deſtroys by far the greateſt part of the Proteſtant Churches in the World, and makes their Baptiſm and all their Adminiſtrations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual. According to the Scripture a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter may lay on hands. 1 Tim. 4.14. <hi>The laying on of the hands of the Preſbytery.</hi> How many ſhould joyn in Impoſing hands, is not determined in the Scripture, but is a Pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial left to Miniſters and Churches to do as they ſhall ſee cauſe. There were belonging to the Church in <hi>Alexandria</hi> twelve Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: When One dyed the other eleven con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in impoſing hands on a Succeſſor. In the Reformed Churches in France, only two Miniſters impoſe hands on the Perſon that is Ordained. Judicious Interpreters ſuppoſe that when <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were Separated to the Work of Preaching the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, that the other Three Miniſters in the Church at Antioch, viz. <hi>Niger, Lucius,</hi> and

                  <p>CHRIST will raiſe up ſuch in every Age and give them to his Church. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry is a ſtanding Ordinance which ſhall abide as long as there ſhall be any need of Officers and Ordinances.

At the laſt day all the Elect of God ſhall be Called, and made perfect in Grace, until that day come there ſhall be Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in the Church. Chriſt has promiſed to be with his Miniſters to the end of the World, which implies that there ſhall be Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters until then. GOD will have a Church on the Earth throughout all Ages. <hi>Unto him be glory in the Church by Chriſt Jeſus throughout all ages,</hi> Gal. 3.21. Hence the Church is compared to a Mountain, not only in reſpect of Viſibility but Perpetuity. Pſal. 125.1. <hi>They that truſt in the Lord ſhall be as Mount Sion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever.</hi> The Church whilſt in this ſinful World will need Teachers and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.

It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes me in reſpect of my Age, (as well as on the account of my having many Years formerly, ſuſtained the <hi>Preſidentſhip</hi> over this <hi>Academy</hi>) to give you <hi>Advice.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. My firſt Word of Advice to you, is, <hi>Do not Enter on the Work, eſpecially ingage not in a Paſtoral Charge before you have attained ſuch a Meaſure of Knowledge as may render you able Miniſters of the New Teſtament.</hi> Firſt fill and then empty. It is reported concerning <hi>Baſil,</hi> and <hi>Gregory,</hi> that they ſpent thirteen Years in preparing for the Work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:001981_0131_0FBA54C8259333A0"/>
before they would undertake it. I adviſe not to ſo long a delay, for a Young Man may be called to be a Prophet, <hi>Zech.</hi> 2.4. But it is certain that a large Stock of Learning is needful to make a Miniſter that ſhall be able to defend the Truth againſt the Sophiſtry of Learned and Subtile Adverſaries. The enemies of the Truth know this. <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate deſtroyed all Publick Schools of Learning among Chriſtians, becauſe (ſaid he) Their Learned Men <hi>Wound us with our own Weapons.</hi> The <hi>Mahometans</hi> are enemies to that which is called <hi>humane Learning:</hi> They are afraid that the light thereof might be a Means to diſcover the falſity of their dark Religion. Some of the <hi>Papiſt</hi> have been great enemies to <hi>Academies.</hi> The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> in their private Inſtructions have this for one, <hi>We most teach that Learning is needleſs in a Pariſh Priests,</hi> ſo do they Jewiſhly term a Miniſter of the New Teſtament. They know that if they could bring it to that paſs that there ſhould be no Learned Men to oppoſe them, the World would be theirs. That ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably Learned &amp; Holy Man Mr. <hi>Chauncey,</hi> who did for many Years <hi>Preſide</hi> over this <hi>College,</hi> Publiſhed a Sermon on thoſe words, in Amos 2.12. <hi>I raiſed up of your Sons for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and of your Young Men for Nazarites:</hi> in which he ſhows how uſeful and neceſſary it is that Preachers ſhould be Learned Men. Eſpecially you ſhould labour after a large meaſure of Scripture Knowledge. And ſince
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:001981_0132_0FBA54C998BDE0A8"/>
the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament were written Originally in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue, and the New Teſtament in <hi>Greek,</hi> a Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Knowledge in both theſe Languages is needful, otherwiſe we ſee with other Mens eyes, and take all upon truſt and report from others, if we are not able our ſelves to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the <hi>Originals.</hi> Some of the Ancients (called Fathers) would not have miſtaken in the Interpretation of diverſe Scriptures ſo as they have done, had they conſulted the Original. Moreover, Knowledge in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral Arts is a good handmaid to <hi>Theology.</hi> A Preacher ſhould have a body of Divinity in his head. There have been many <hi>Syſtems</hi> thereof Publiſhed, but above all that I have ſeen, I recommend unto you Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> his <hi>Medulla Theologiae.</hi> That Supereminent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Dr. <hi>Thomas Goodwin</hi> would ſometimes ſay, That he eſteemed that Book as the beſt Book in the World next to the Holy Bible. I remember an Hungarian Proteſtant aſſured me that in thoſe Proteſtant Churches, they never Ordained any Miniſter without requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Legistine Ameſium.</hi> I Exhort you not only to read it, but to digeſt it, and adhere to the Principles of Truth contained therein. It was once moſt highly eſteemed of by the <hi>Students</hi> in this <hi>College</hi>; yea, by all thoſe of them that have proved Eminent Men of God in their Generation. Let it ever be ſo. But beſides <hi>Theology,</hi> a Miniſter ſhould have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with other ſorts of Learning.

Eſpecially with <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory.</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to you the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory of the <hi>Magdeburgenſian</hi> Divines, in which you will ſee what the Chriſtian Church was in the Primitive Times, and how Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Degeneracy did gradually corrupt both the Doctrine and Diſcipline thereof, until at laſt it became quite another Church, than what it was in the Apoſtles dayes, and what Hereſies have Peſtered the Church in ſeveral Ages.

Does not the Apoſtle ſay, That if he could <hi>Speak with the Tongue of Men and Angels, and had the gift of Propheſy, and underſtood all Mysteries,</hi> if he had not the Grace of Love to God and Man, he ſhould be notwithſtanding thoſe eminent accompliſhments, <hi>but as ſounding braſs and a tinkling ſymbal,</hi> which has a taking ſound with it, 1 Cor. 13.1, 2. <hi>Quid prodeſt eſſe peritum et periturum.</hi> If a Man ſhould gain the Applauſe of the whole World, what is he advantaged, if he looſe himſelf, or be caſt away.

others, but if they are not Sanctified they will aggravate the Condemnation of the Man that has been adorned with them. Many who helped to build the Ark were drowned in the flood. So many who by Means of their Miniſterial gifts have helped to build the Church will periſh Eternally. All the World will ſee that this is true at the laſt day, when <hi>not a few</hi> but <hi>many</hi> ſhall ſay to Chriſt, <hi>Lord, have not we Propheſied in thy Name, and in thy Name done wonderful works</hi>; and Chriſt will ſay to them for all that you were workers of iniquity, and therefore depart from me, I know you not, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.23. Oh! remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the awful words of the Apoſtle, 1 Cor. 9.27. <hi>Leſt that by any Means, when I have Preached to others, I my ſelf ſhould be a caſt away.</hi>

                     <p n="3">3. <hi>When you Enter upon Publick Preaching, Endeavour that your Sermons may be ſuch as ſhall be profitable to thoſe that hear them.</hi> If you would Preach profitably, you may not Preach your ſelves, but CHRIST. Young Preachers are apt to make an oſtentation of their Parts, and Wit, and Learning, which ought not to be. <hi>Paul</hi> was the moſt Learned of all the Apoſtles, but how careful was he not to make any ſhew of it! Sermons painted with fine Phraſes and Flouriſhes are like painted Windows which obſcure the light. One ſays well, That ſuch Preachers <hi>put the Sword of the Spirit into a velvet Scabbard, which
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:001981_0135_0FBA54D66325DD20"/>
keeps it from wounding the heart.</hi> If you would Preach profitably, Preach plain Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Sermons. Scriptures are the Sinews of a Sermon. Confirm all that you ſay with them. It is the Preachers duty to do ſo: He may not come to the Congregation with Notions of his own, but with the Word of God. 1 Pet. 4.11. <hi>If any ſpeak, let him ſpeak as the Oracles of God.</hi> And if you would Preach profitably, ſingle out profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Subjects to Diſcourſe on; dwell rather on Practical than Polemical Subjects: <hi>e. g. Concerning the Evil of Sin, and Mans Natural Sinfulneſs, and the abſolute neceſſity of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in order to Salvation, and the danger of Hypocriſy, and how far Men may go in the Profeſſion and Practice of Religion, and yet fall ſhort of Heaven at laſt. This is a Subject much to be inſiſted on, ſince there have been and there are Notorious Hereticks who have excelled in a ſeeming Piety.</hi> But beſure you <hi>Preach JESUS CHRIST and His Righteouſneſs.</hi> The Learned <hi>Scultetus,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves that the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> Preach up <hi>Morality,</hi> and Good Works, but not a Word of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt; and that <hi>Seneca,</hi> and <hi>Plutarch,</hi> and other Moral Philoſophers teach as Good Morality as they do. The iniquity of ſome <hi>Clergy Men</hi> at this day, who ſay, they are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, is very great, ſince they have little either of CHRIST, or of Scripture in
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:001981_0136_0FBA54D8042C7F28"/>
their Sermons. Nay, they count it a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to their Sermons, if the Name of Chriſt is often mentioned therein. How unlike are ſuch to that good Old <hi>Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>Si ſcribas, ſi conferas, non mihi placet, niſi ſonuerit ibi Jeſus.</hi> And how unlike unto the bleſſed Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who in his Epiſtles, mentions the Name of Chriſt four hundred and fifty times; and in one Chapter (<hi>viz.</hi> 1 Cor. 1.) in 10. verſes, he mentions the Name of Chriſt ten times. And he faith to them, That <hi>he determined to know nothing,</hi> that is, to Preach nothing among them but <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.2. The Corinthians were a Polite People, and ſome of them no doubt great Scholars; and it might have been thought that among ſuch a People, he would have come with excellency of Speech and of Wiſdom, but he Preached Chriſt with all poſſible plaineſs; His Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching was not with enticing Words of Mens Wiſdom. Therefore let us Preach Chriſt as becomes the Simplicity of the Goſpel. CHRIST is ſuch a Subject as can never be drawn dry. A Miniſter may Preach of him all his days, and there is more to be ſaid ſtill. The Truths relating to Chriſt Angels deſire to look into. The Myſtery of his Perſon, Office, Humiliation and Exaltation will be the Admiration of Saints and Angels throughout the days of Eternity.

And can we Preach or Hear too much of them now? Our famous Engliſh Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologiſt, gave that Advice to his Friend, Brother, <hi>Preach Jeſus Chriſt, Preach Jeſus Chriſt</hi> It was his Complaint that Chriſt was not Preached in <hi>England</hi> then, ſo much as ſhould be.

For a Miniſter of the Goſpel whoſe Work is a <hi>Spiritual Husbandry,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.9. to neglect that, and betake himſelf to his Farm, if it is done of choice, is evil.

I was then a Young Man, Eighteen Years Old, ingaged in a Voyage for <hi>England,</hi> when I took my leave of him, his Advice to me was, <hi>Keep out of all Company whatſoever as far as the rules of Chriſtianity and Civility will allow, for you will ſurely find that for the most part, the time ſpent in your Study will be time moſt profitably ſpent.</hi> I have found his Advice good and true, and have very much Endeavoured to order my Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation accordingly from my Youth unto this day, I hope not altogether without benefit to ſome others as well as to my ſelf.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall not inlarge on <hi>Motives,</hi> in which either they that deſign the Miniſtry, or ſuch as are already ingaged in it may be concerned. I need not to ſay to you, That an Unfaithful Miniſter is the Unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt Man in the World. A fearful thing it is to Trifle in that Work. <hi>Qui ludit in Cathedra, lugebit in gehenna,</hi> is a true ſaying and a terrible one. For one that has

ſhewed others the way to Heaven to fall ſhort of it himſelf, how diſmal is the thought of it? Miniſters are called An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. If one of them fall ſhort of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, an Angel falls from Heaven. How amazing is it?</p>
                     <p>Nor ſhall I inlarge on the Conſideration of the Joy and Glory that will follow, if we approve our ſelves faithful to Chriſt and the Souls of Men. When a faithful Miniſter ſhall ſay to Chriſt at the laſt day, <hi>Lord, here am I and the Children whom thou hast given me,</hi> Here am I, and the Souls who have been Converted and Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by my Miniſtry; and one ſhall ſtand forth and ſay, This is the Man by whoſe Miniſtry I was Converted, if it had not been for Thy Preſence with him, I had never been brought home to Chriſt; and another ſhall ſay, This is the Man by whoſe Miniſtry I was built up in Faith and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, bleſſed be Thy Name that ever I ſaw his Face, bleſſed be Thy Name that ever I heard his Voice, Will there not be <hi>glorious Joy</hi>! But O what <hi>Joy,</hi> when CHRIST Himſelf ſhall ſay, <hi>Well done, thou faithful Servant, Enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord,</hi> Amen! O LORD.</p>
