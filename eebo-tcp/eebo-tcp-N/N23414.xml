            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE enſuing diſcourſe, as is uſually ſaid, was haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily compoſed without any thought of its being made public; which is now done at the repeated ſolicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of many of the hearers. And the purport of it is to ſhew, that the commiſſion Chriſt gave his apoſtles, and the religion he impowered them to teach, does not in the leaſt infringe that equality which GOD had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore eſtabliſhed among all the human race.</p>
            <p>It has long appeared to the author, that all rule and dominion—all authority, power and government, under whatever form, either in church or ſtate, which does not originate from the free choice of the people, is uſurped, and ought to be held in the utmoſt contempt indignation and abhorance! And that our Saviour has guaranteed and ſecured the natural equality of men by expreſs precepts; as, <hi>Be not ye called Rabbi; for one it your Maſter, even Chriſt; and all ye are brethren,</hi> &amp;c. It is accordingly attempted to be proved in the following pages, that Chriſt gave his apoſtles no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or dominion over mankind, but only ſimply commiſſioned them to baptize men, and teach them to obſerve whatſoever HE himſelf had taught; and that the commiſſion intended to be continued to the end of the world, contains nothing more. The conſequence of which is, that a man cannot have any power or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the church any more than he can in the ſtate unleſs he derives it from the people!</p>

                  <p>And when they ſaw him, they worſhipped him; but ſome doubted. And Jeſus came and ſpake to them, ſaying, all power is given unto me in Heaven and in Earth. Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt: teaching them to obſerve all things whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I have commanded you. And lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the world. Amen.</p>

            <p>WHILE we celebrate the birth day of this Jeſus, 'tis proper to conſider, firſt, who he was?</p>
            <p>Secondly—For what purpoſe he came into our world?</p>
            <p>And Thirdly—By what means the end of his coming is to be accompliſhed?</p>
            <p>Firſt then we enquire, Who he was?</p>
            <p>THE Diſciples, who ſaw him after his reſurrection, believed him to be GOD, as well as man: for when they ſaw him they worſhipped him.—Well aware that they ought not to worſhip any but God and fully convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, by his riſing on the third day, according to his promiſe that he was GOD, they worſhipped him. But ſome doubted.—Obſerving this, Jeſus came—(that is came nearer)—and ſpake to them, ſaying, all power is given unto me in Heaven and in Earth.—Go teach and baptize all nations, and I will be with you to the end of the world—I will ſupport you in the execution of your office—I will give ſufficient proof, by the works I will enable you to do, that I have ſent you and that indeed I <hi>have</hi> all power in Heaven and in Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:030992_0005_0FEA1E4BC6023928"/>WE learn from the other Evangeliſts, that Jeſus, on this occaſion, promiſed the miraculous gifts of the Holy Ghoſt; the fulfilment of which promiſe, together with his own reſurrection, abundantly demonſtrated that he was GOD And if it was indeed a fact, that he did riſe from the dead; and if it was alſo a fact, that he did, according to his promiſe, enable his diſciples to work miracles.—(and it ſeems ſcarcely poſſible that men could be impoſed on in ſuch plain matters of facts) if theſe things, I ſay, were facts, it muſt be that he was what he pretended, and had all power in Heaven and in Earth. We may therefore ſafely conclude that he was GOD—We proceed then to the ſecond inquiry: For what purpoſe did he come into <hi>our</hi> world?</p>
            <p>HIS name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> ſingnifies a Saviour. The Angel who foretold his birth, called his name Jeſus, becauſe he ſhould ſave his people from their ſins.</p>
            <p>AND he himſelf tells us that he came—to call ſinners to repentance.</p>
            <p>HE gave himſelf for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himſelf a peculiar people zealous of good works.</p>
            <p>HE ſuffered,—the juſt for the unjuſt, that he might bring us to GOD.—Who ſo loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</p>
            <p>THE wretched and miſerable ſtate of Man, after he had tranſgreſſed the divine law, moved the eternal fountain of compaſſion and mercy to contrive a way for man's recovery; to make atonement for ſin; to procure us pardon and acceptance with GOD, and to bring us to that eternal glory and happineſs for which human nature was firſt intended!—But the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of our Saviour, and the end and deſign of his coming into the world, are matters ſo well underſtood, that I need not take up much of your time on <hi>theſe</hi> heads.—What I chiefly intend at this time, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the means by which <hi>that end</hi> is to be accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:030992_0006_0FEA1E4F1117FA00"/>THE death and ſufferings of Chriſt are the only cauſe of the pardon of ſin; but as the pardon of ſin is but a part of the deſign of his incarnation, other means are yet to be uſed. <hi>Men are to be made fit</hi> to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the inheritance of the Saints in light: And to accompliſh this part of the deſign he has inſtituted a religion; founded a church in the world, and commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned an order of men to make diſciples to him, to baptize them, and teach them to obſerve all things whatſoever <hi>he</hi> hath commanded. What we call the Chriſtian religion is therefore a matter of great importance to mankind. Obſerving the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it; living according to the rules and precepts of it; is, ſo far as we know, the only means of eſcaping eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ruin, and being qualified for the enjoyment of ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erlaſting happineſs.</p>
            <p>THE commiſſion therefore which Chriſt gave his Apoſtles, being the only means of conveying to us the knowledge of this religion; and thoſe who refuſe to comply with what that commiſſion empowered them to require, being threatened with damnation; it concerns us to enquire into the nature and import of that commiſſion.</p>
            <p>HAD the Apoſtles taken it into their heads to require ſomething which their commiſſion did not warrant, there could have been no harm in refuſing to ſubmit to it. We find indeed that they have not done this; but 'tis more than probable that ſome of their ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors have.</p>
            <p>SOME who call themſelves the Apoſtles' ſucceſſors, have exerciſed powers and authority which Chriſt nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er gave his Apoſtles, and which <hi>they</hi> never did and never could give to any body elſe; for it is certain they could not give others more power than they had themſelves; but 'tis not certain that they gave them quite ſo much.</p>
            <p>THAT the commiſſion which Chriſt gave his Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles had no reference to one place or diſtrict more than
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:030992_0007_0FEA1E50BA626558"/>
another is evident from the very <hi>words</hi> of my text. <hi>Go ye and teach all nations,</hi> or as St. Mark records it; <hi>Go into all the world and preach the Goſpel to every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> All <hi>power,</hi> ſays he, <hi>in Heaven and in Earth</hi> is giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en unto ME; <hi>I</hi> therefore, by virtue of this power, <hi>ſend you</hi>;—not to be lords over particular diſtricts—nor indeed to be lords over any body; but to teach and baptize—to teach whatſoever <hi>I</hi> have commanded you; and to enable you to do this, ye ſhall receive the Holy Ghoſt, who ſhall bring to your remembrance whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I have taught you. And I will myſelf inflict dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation on thoſe who refuſe to believe that Goſpel I ſend you to preach. I will ſtill hold all power in my own hands; and to overcome the oppoſition which my Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel will meet with at its firſt ſetting out in the world; I will, by the Holy Ghoſt, enable you to ſpeak with new tongues—diſcern ſpirits, and work miracles.</p>
            <p>IT appears then that the Apoſtles' commiſſion em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered them to do no more than baptize men, and declare to them the will of their maſter. And leſt they ſhould attempt to to exerciſe lordſhip and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over their <hi>fellow-creatures</hi>; he more than once ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly forbids it. <hi>Be not ye called maſters—it ſhall not be ſo among you!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had no juriſdiction, or authority over particular diſtricts, ſo neither did they pretend to give any body elſe. As they were not placed over particular pariſhes themſelves, ſo neither did they ever place any body elſe over any.</p>
            <p>AND further: As they had no power to diſcard or ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence any of their brethren, ſo neither did they, or could they, give any ſuch power to their ſucceſſors!</p>
            <p>THE arguments on which the contrary opinion is grounded, are chiefly drawn from the caſe of Timothy at Epheſus. And Titus at Crete.—We are told, in the poſtcripts to the Epiſtles to Timothy and Titus, that they were ordained Biſhops, the one over Epheſus, and the other over Crete.—Who ordained them is a
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:030992_0008_0FEA1E53F21D29A0"/>
queſtion. We have no evidence that Paul did it: much leſs that he ordained them over theſe diſtricts. St. Paul indeed when he wrote his firſt Epiſtle to Timothy, beſought him to abide ſtill at Epheſus, while he [Paul] went into Macedonia. But it does not follow from this, that Timothy was at Epheſus when that epiſtle was written; much leſs that Paul had placed him over that diſtrict. I did at a certain time, ſays Paul, beſeech thee to abide ſtill there; which ſhews that the Apoſtle did not authoratively place him there. Had Timothy been ordained by an Apoſtle over Epheſus, and had he believed the Apoſtle had power ſo to ordain him, he would have ſtayed there very cheerfully, let him have had ever ſo many, and ever ſo great CALLS, to get elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where! So that the Apoſtle need not have <hi>beſought</hi> him to abide there.</p>
            <p>BUT it is added that Paul in his ſecond Epiſtle, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins Timothy to ſtir up the gift of GOD that was in him, by the putting on of the Apoſtle's hands; which ſhews, they ſay, that Paul ordained him.</p>
            <p>BUT to this, I anſwer: that the gift here mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was probably <hi>not</hi> the commiſſion of a Goſpel Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe there appears an impropriety in requiring him to <hi>ſtir it up.</hi> Should any one ſay to me; come Sir, you don't <hi>ſtir up</hi> your <hi>commiſſion!</hi> You muſt <hi>ſtir up the commiſſion</hi> that is in you by the laying on of the hands of the <hi>Biſhop;</hi> I ſhould not think he ſpoke properly!</p>
            <p>BUT if we obſerve that the Holy Ghoſt is frequently in Scripture called <hi>fire,</hi>—and that this fire was convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the laying on of the Apoſtles' hands; there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears a peculiar propriety in requiring Timothy to ſtir up that gift.—<hi>The ſpirit of the Prophets is ſubject to Prophets.</hi>—A man who had the miraculous gift of the Holy Ghoſt could exerciſe that gift or let it alone. But you know how it is with fire, to make it ſhine and give heat, you muſt ſtir it up. The gift was from GOD conveyed by the hands of Paul, but the exerciſe of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:030992_0009_0FEA1E57805576E8"/>
that gift was the buſineſs of Timothy. So far then was Paul from ordaining Timothy <hi>over</hi> Epheſus that he did not ordain him at all. And the directions given to Timothy reſpecting the qualifications of a Biſhop and Deacon, and the manner of receiving an accuſation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an Elder, do not concern Timothy as <hi>Biſhop of Epheſus</hi>; but that <hi>he might know how he ought to behave in the Houſe of GOD. Which is, ſays he, the Church of the</hi> LIVING GOD: That is, the univerſal Church. <hi>In</hi> this great houſe Timothy had a great deal of work to do. Accordingly Paul calls on him to endure afflictions; to make full proof of his miniſtry, and do the work of an Evangeliſt; which ſeems hardly compatible with <hi>fattening in a Dioceſe.</hi> For the work of an Evangeliſt was to travel from place to place, to propogate and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſh the Chriſtian faith wherever occaſion and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity offered. St. Paul had run the ſame courſe, and had, as he ſays, now finiſhed it; and calls on Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy and Titus to do as he had done. It further appears that Timothy was <hi>not</hi> biſhop of Epheſus, from the 20th of Acts; where we find him with Paul on his travels. And we find alſo Paul ſending from Miletus and calling the elders of Epheſus, and inſtructing them in their duty; which we preſume he need not have done, if Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy had been ſettled <hi>there</hi> for life, as <hi>overſeer of thoſe overſeers.</hi> At this time Timothy did not reſide at E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus; and he was not there when Paul wrote his <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> epiſtle to him; neither do I believe he was there when the apoſtle wrote his <hi>firſt</hi> epiſtle to him. Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy then was not biſhop of Epheſus!</p>
            <p>Let us next ſee how the caſe was with Titus, who, we are told, was ordained the firſt biſhop of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians. Poor Cretians! they did not enjoy their biſhop but a little while! For we find Paul requeſting him to come to him at Nicopolis; and the year after, in his laſt epiſtle to Timothy, he tells us, Titus had depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Dalmatia. Paul therefore did not ordain <hi>Titus</hi> biſhop <hi>over</hi> Crete, he only <hi>left</hi> him <hi>in</hi> Crete, that he
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:030992_0010_0FEA1E5919C29AC0"/>
might ſet in order the things which were wanting and ordain elders <hi>in</hi> every City. What a pity it is, the apoſtle had not ſaid, "ordain elders <hi>over</hi> every city!" By their wanting elders or preſbyters <hi>in every</hi> city, it ſeems there was not one prieſt on the Iſland when Paul left it; to ſupply that defect, and ſome others not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, Titus was left in Crete; and when he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed the buſineſs, he left Crete and travelled on.<note n="*" place="bottom">Doctor WHITBY obſerves; that Timothy and Titus are never called biſhops of Epheſus and Crete by any writer of the three firſt centuries. But ſays the learned Doctor, that defect is abundantly ſupplied by the ſuffrages of the fourth and fifth centuries. Then, I ſuppoſe, the poſtſcrips were written.</note>
            </p>
            <p>BUT it will be aſked; does not the apoſtle call the elders of Epheſus <hi>overſeers?</hi> And does not this imply that they had <hi>authority</hi> over their flocks? And did not <hi>Timothy ordain</hi> theſe overſeers; and by <hi>ordaining</hi> them, gave them the overſight of their particular flocks? To this I anſwer, <hi>I know not what reaſon we have to ſuppoſe that Timothy ordained them?</hi> But if he <hi>did;</hi> his ordaining them did nothing towards making them overſeers: becauſe the Apoſtle ſays the Holy Ghoſt made them over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers. And 'tis probable theſe overſeers were able to give ſome proof of their having received their authority from the Holy Ghoſt; otherwiſe their flocks would have had too much ſenſe to regard them. But what were theſe overſeers to do? Nothing more than <hi>feed</hi> the Church of GOD! Not threſh the members of it with an <hi>iron flail. Feeding</hi> the church of GOD being a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent thing from <hi>governing</hi> it, which makes it proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that theſe overſeers were <hi>not</hi> governors; but if they were, 'twas the Holy Ghoſt who made them ſuch, and not biſhop Timothy. Their ruling and governing powers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if they had any, were not derived from Chriſt by virtue of the commiſſion <hi>he</hi> gave his Apoſtles, and which he intended ſhould be continued to the end of the world; but theſe powere were imparted to them
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:030992_0011_0FEA1E5C10E38068"/>
by the Holy Ghost and did not belong to their commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as goſpel miniſters.</p>
            <p>THE peculiar circumſtances of the church at that time, required gifts and powers, which were not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in after ages—accordingly he gave Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, Prophets, Paſtors, Teachers, Governors, Helpers—Speakers with tongues, Interpreters of tongues, Deſcerners of ſpirits, Workers of miracules &amp;c. &amp;c. All which offices, gifts and powers, ceaſed when the church was eſtabliſhed in the world; and can never exiſt again, unleſs it ſhall pleaſe GOD again to pour out his ſpirit upon all fleſh as he did in that day.</p>
            <p>BUT what ſays Paul to Timothy? A Biſhop, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeer, muſt be one that <hi>ruleth</hi> well his own houſe— for if a man know not how to <hi>rule</hi> his own houſe; how ſhall he <hi>take care of</hi> the Church of GOD! <hi>Take care of it!</hi>— Alas; what a pity it is, the Apoſtle had not ſaid, how ſhall he <hi>rule</hi> the Church of GOD. We find then nothing in the New Teſtament that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to the modern idea of ſpiritual rulers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Governors!</p>
            <p>WHAT then! —you will ſay —are we in this age, to have no church government! no diſcipline! — who ſhall judge, cenſure and excommunicate offenders! who ſhall diſcard and ſilence a wicked Miniſter!—</p>
            <p>To ſolve this we muſt look back to the XVII chapter of St. Matt. (and 'tis wiſhed that every body would read that chapter) where we had our Lord inſtructing his diſciples in the buſineſs of diſcipline. If thy brother treſpaſs againſt thee, go &amp; tell him his fault between thee and him alone; if he hear thee, thou haſt gained thy brother; but if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witneſſes every word may be eſtabliſhed. And if he neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be to thee as a heathen man, and a publican.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:030992_0012_0FEA1E5DAFB2A9B0"/>THERE will be no difficulty in underſtanding <hi>this,</hi> if we can only determine what is <hi>here</hi> meant by the word CHURCH. And if men were leſt to the dictates of common ſenſe, they doubtleſs <hi>would</hi> underſtand it juſt as our Lord intended. The word Church, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, in different places, uſed in different ſenſes; but 'tis moſt natural to ſuppoſe, our Lord <hi>here</hi> meant by it the congregation, or ſociety, to which the offending brother belongs. He ſurely did not mean to ſend us to Rome! He did not mean that we ſhould croſs the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantic; nor ride poſthaſte to New London; nor call a conſociation. He doubtleſs intended that his diſciples, in all parts of the world, as many as can convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſhould meet together in one place to worſhip GOD. And wherever <hi>any</hi> number, if it be but two or three, <hi>are</hi> met together in the name of Chriſt, there is he in the midſt of them; and there is the Church.</p>
            <p>THE body, or ſociety, be it greater or leſs, has a <hi>right,</hi> and ſufficient <hi>power,</hi> to <hi>expel</hi> from itſelf an <hi>unruly member,</hi> if he cannot be reclaimed; and if he repents, they can <hi>reſtore</hi> him. If there is a clergyman in this ſociety, he is under the ſame law, ſubject to the ſame fate; we know no diſtinction. And we know of no other diſcipline intended for the chriſtian church af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inſpiration and miracles ceaſed. See the 1ſt epiſtle to the Corinthians, 5th, 12th and 13th Chapters. <hi>Do not ye judge them who are within</hi> [your ſociety?] <hi>Them who are without GOD judgeth. Therefore put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from among yourſelves that wicked perſon.</hi> See al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, 2nd to the Theſſ. 3rd chap.—14th and 15th verſes. <hi>If any man obey not our word by this epiſtle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed. Yet count him not as an enemy, but admon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh him as a brother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>PUNISHING an offending brother with death, or with bodily diſeaſes—or remitting and retaining ſins, binding &amp; looſing, inflicting corporeal or pecuniary pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:030992_0013_0FEA1E60B52043F8"/>
—is no part of the church's buſineſs at <hi>this day.</hi> Whatever of this kind has ever been done by divine authority, has been done by immediate inſpiration. And the Pope is ſo far in the right: firſt to pretend to infallibility, before he undertakes to remit and retain ſins, or to puniſh heretics. For even that injunction to <hi>biſhop</hi> Titus—(after the firſt and ſecond admonition) to <hi>reject</hi> a heretic, required and ſuppoſed inſpiration in <hi>Titus.</hi> Becauſe the Apoſtle <hi>there</hi> ſays, a heretic is one who is ſelf condemned; which is impoſſible to be known without inſpiration. And thus we ſee who is to judge, cenſure and excomunicate offenders. <hi>'Tis the church or congregation to which the offender belongs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſtill you will repeat, and reiterate the queſtion: Who ſhall diſcard and ſilence a wicked <hi>miniſter?</hi> Why, we have already obſerved, that the miniſter is ſubject to the ſame <hi>law</hi> with the reſt of the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: we know no diſtinction!</p>
            <p>But ſtill, you ſay, St. <hi>Paul</hi> inſtructed <hi>biſhop Timothy</hi> how to receive an accuſation againſt an offending <hi>elder,</hi> or prieſt. 'Tis true he did ſo: but we have ſhewn that Timothy was an <hi>evangeliſt,</hi> had inſpiration,—and <hi>more power</hi> than goſpel miniſters <note n="*" place="bottom">Alas for the POWER!—Why don't they cure Joe Mudge?</note> at this day. But even <hi>Timothy</hi> with all <hi>his power,</hi> could do nothing about ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencing a wicked miniſter. All he could do was only to <hi>rebuke!</hi> Them who ſin, <hi>rebuke;</hi> ſays the apoſtle. Why hid he not ſay; hang them up; put them down; turn them out; unordain them; take away their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion!</p>
            <p>The apoſtle well knew that the commiſſion origina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from Chriſt, and none but he could take it away. And the ordainer, <hi>if he is any thing,</hi> is the inſtrument of conveyance only. If the commiſſion originates from Chriſt, although the ordainer <hi>does</hi> convey it, yet he can not take it away. No power, ſhort of that from which the commiſſion originates is ſufficient to
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030992_0014_0FEA1E65F7E595E8"/>
               <hi>recall it.</hi>—He, <hi>who has all power in heaven and in earth, might</hi> have ordered, that his miniſters ſhould uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionate one another; he <hi>might</hi> have done this, I ſay; but I deny that he <hi>has.</hi> As the caſe now ſtands; 'tis juſt as if the Governor of the ſtate ſhould ſend me, by one of this congregation, a commiſſion to execute ſome office in the civil or military department; and the man who conveys and hands the commiſſion, ſhould take it into his head to recall it, and forbid me to act accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it. In that caſe, I believe, you would all call me a fool, if I regarded him; unleſs he could prove that the power from which the commiſſion iſſued, had expreſsly ordered and empowered him to do ſo.</p>
            <p>How any man <hi>can,</hi> at this day become a goſpel miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Is a queſtion we ſhall not, at preſent, meddle with. But if he once has that commiſſion, he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy all the powers of earth and hell to take it away. If the ordainer conveys the commiſſion, the man who has it, may go into the world, and teach and baptize, in deſpite of what the ordainer can do. If he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted in one city, he may flee to another. If any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to receive, or hear him, he may ſhake off his duſt, and paſs on. He never can become the miniſter of any <hi>particular pariſh,</hi> unleſs the people of that pariſh make a contract with him; and when they have done ſo, all the <hi>powers</hi> under heaven cannot diſſolve that contract.—Not diſſolve it!—What then muſt a congregation do, if their miniſter turns wicked? They muſt be in a woeful eaſe, if they cannot find ſomebody to ſilence him! Don't be frightened friends!—A congregation, ſo far as <hi>concerns them,</hi> may <hi>ſilence</hi> their own miniſter, <hi>if they find juſt cauſe.</hi> For, "if thy brother treſſpaſs againſt thee, go and tell him his fault." —If thou findeſt aught againſt thy brother, who is a miniſter, (and I adviſe thee to keep a good watch) go and tell him his fault—if nothing elſe will do; tell it to the church. Call the miniſter and the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion together. And if it appears that he has not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:030992_0015_0FEA1E679AD245A0"/>
his part of the contract. If he has tranſgreſſed what the goſpel makes his duty, and refuſes to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed; then let him be unto thee as a heathen man and a publican. The congregation, in that caſe, may ſafely put away from <hi>among themſelves</hi> that wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: and ſufficient will be his puniſhment, which is inflicted by many.—Oh! but, you will ſay, that won't do; for he will draw his ſalary ſtill. We ſhall have him to pay during life, notwithſtanding all this! —Why ſo!—Why, becauſe the law of the land im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered the ordainer to place him over the pariſh; &amp; the ſame law impowers the ordainer to take him down again, and unordain him.—Ah indeed! — Is it the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil law that impowers goſpel miniſters to unordain one another!—I have long thought that they did not derive ſuch power from Chriſt. And it ſeems the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators thought ſo too, or they would not have meddled with the matter.</p>
            <p>If it be the civil power that <hi>makes</hi> a goſpel miniſter; the civil power can, without doubt <hi>unmake</hi> him. — Or, if a man's having ſuch and ſuch qualifications authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes him to teach and baptize; then when he ceaſes to have thoſe qualifications, he looſes his authority. In either of <hi>theſe</hi> caſes; for the miniſters of Chriſt, as ſuch, whether biſhops or preſbyters, to pretend to ſuſpend, or ſilence a miniſter, is but a ſolemn farce, a meer ſham, and deſerves no other notice but ridicule. So that chooſe what method you will to make a man a miniſter; when once he <hi>is</hi> made, his brother miniſters have no power over him. And he, by the law of Chriſt has no power over the people. All he can do by virtue of his commiſſion as a goſpel miniſter, is only to teach and baptize!—What! you will ſay; is it not the prieſt's buſineſs to adminiſter the Lord's ſupper? Does not the apoſtle injoin the overſeers of Epheſus to <hi>feed</hi> the church of God?—Yes: and they were to feed it as <hi>Paul had</hi> done. They were to feed it with milk; (the ſincere milk of the word) if it could not bear ſtrong meat but not with bread and wine. The fact is; according
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:030992_0016_0FEA1E6984A4C050"/>
to the new teſtament there is no adminiſtering about the Lord's ſupper, and the prieſt has no more to do with it than any other chriſtian.<note n="*" place="bottom">Conſecrating the elements, differs only in degree from TRANSUBSTANTIATING them. The prieſt may as well, when his hand is in, perform the whole miracle, as a part of it. HE may as well convert the bread and wine into the body and blood of Chriſt, as, in ANY DEGREE, to change the nature of them!— —Whoever can believe that a prieſt, by taking the bread and cup into his hand; or by dipping his finger into the water of baptiſm, can make them any holier than they were before; may e'en go on, and belive all the abſurdities of Popery. Whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver can believe that a DEACON may PREACH AND BAPTIZE, (which is all that Chriſt's commiſſion empowers ANY MAN to do) but that it requires a higher order to adminiſter the Lord's Supper; and a higher order ſtill to adminiſter the holy rite of confirmation;—may go on, and believe all the claims and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of Saint Peter's ſucceſſor.</note>—That chriſtians, when they come together to eat the Lord's ſupper, ſhould conſider it as the moſt ſolemn act of worſhip; —That they ſhould, by the eye of faith, diſcern the Lord's body;—That they ſhould call to mind his death and ſuffering, and that ſin was the cauſe of them;— That they ſhould examine themſelves, and look well to the motives and views which govern them—are facts which none can doubt who read the new Teſtament: —But that they cannot eat that ſupper unleſs they have a prieſt to conſecrate the elements and make them holy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then <hi>adminiſter</hi> them,—is a whim, which has no foundation in that book,—as is all pretence to lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and eccleſiaſtical government, derived from the commiſſion Chriſt gave his apoſtles.</p>
            <p>But, you will ſay; does not the apoſtle tell the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews; to remember them that had the rule over them, —to obey them that had the rule over them, and and ſubmit themſelves; and to ſalute them that had the rule over them?</hi>—And does our Lord tell Peter that he would give him the <hi>keys</hi> of the kingdom of Heaven? And does not all this imply that Chriſt has given his miniſters <hi>power</hi> over men? By no means. For as we
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030992_0017_0FEA1E6B51509E00"/>
have already obſerved; <hi>that age</hi> was the age of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and inſpiration, and the Holy Ghoſt did then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part extraordinary gifts and powers, which ſoon after ceaſed—and theſe <hi>rulers,</hi> whatever they were, might be immediately conſtituted ſuch by the Holy Ghoſt, like the <hi>overſeers</hi> of Epheſus—Or they might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted rulers by the free choice of the people. But <hi>however</hi> they <hi>might</hi> become rulers over the Hebrews; —what they ſpake being called the word of God, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies that they had <hi>inſpiration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as to Peter's having the keys, it means no more than that he ſhould unlock the door, and ſet open the gate of the kingdom of Heaven, or the goſpel church. Which he did, by being the firſt preacher of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel both to Jews and Gentiles. And as his name ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a rock;—and as he was the firſt preacher and founder of chriſtianity, it might be ſaid, by a figure, that the church was built on him. But having <hi>opened</hi> the door, he had nothing further to do with the keys. And we do not find he <hi>attempted</hi> to make any other uſe of them.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole it appears, that in this buſineſs of church government, we have been as much hoodwink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as ever we were in the buſineſs of ſtate govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>It appears alſo, that as the chriſtian religion is of infinite importance to mankind; ſo it is alſo plain, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and rational, —every way adapted to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and neceſſities of men; calculated, in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree to promote the peace and happineſs of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety—and inſtead of infringing, was intended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to ſecure and eſtabliſh the inherent Rights, and native equality of all the children of Adam!</p>
            <p>To conclude then; —All the uſe I wiſh you to make of this diſcourſe is, to be hereby excited to open your eyes, and then open your Bibles, and ſee for yourſelves. The Bible has been too often repreſented as a very <hi>gloomy</hi> ſort of a book; fit only to amuſe a <hi>melancholy</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:030992_0018_0FEA1E7060523B20"/>
hour. It has been repreſented as full of miſtery and obſcurity, and requiring a great deal of learning and ſtudy to underſtand it, but it requires no great ſtudy to underſtand whence this notion is derived!— We are often told what a bleſſing it is to have the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in our hands, and in our mother tongue. We are often pitying the poor Roman Catholics, who are, by their ſpiritual rulers, denied the uſe of it. <hi>We</hi> are highly favored indeed! But pray tell me what is the difference between having no Bible at all, and only having it ſmoakdrying on a ſhelf, while we depend wholy on a prieſt to tell us what it contains, or how we ſhall underſtand it. Does not the Bible contain that very goſpel, and the whole of it, which Chriſt ſent his apoſtles to preach, and are we not threatened with damnation if we refuſe to believe it? Were not the apoſtles inſpired for that purpoſe; to guide them into all truth, and bring to their remembrance what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Chriſt had taught! And have they not recorded that truth? And does it not concern us to look into it? Let me aſſure you my friends; <hi>it is not that gloomy book!</hi> I have read a few books in my day, &amp; ſome with great ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerneſs and ſatisfaction; but never one, except the Bible, but in a little time grew <hi>ſtale,</hi> I loſt my reliſh for it, and laid it aſide. But the Bible is always new. The more I read it the better I love it. The more I am acquainted with it, the more entertainment and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction I find in it: and it ſeems as if that would be the caſe to all eternity! And this very circumſtance clearly evinces, that the Bible is of a different origin from all other books. And 'tis a mark of its divinity, that its contents are ſo long unfolding. Oh! My friends! Could we read this book with that attention, candor and impartiality, which the nature of it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands! Could we lay aſide all bigotry, ſuperſtition, and party ſpirit. Could we ſtrip chriſtianity of the fooleries and fopperies—Could we unload it of the lumber, which ignorance and prieſt-craft have
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030992_0019_0FEA1E7329DED770"/>
heaped upon it, we ſhould be charmed with it— We ſhould embrace it with eagerneſs—Conform to it with cheerfulneſs— obey its precepts with ſincerity, and ſhould then have the witneſs in ourſelves, and feel the genuine influence of it on our hearts, and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of it would appear in our lives! 'Twould raiſe us above the world! 'Twould carry as fearleſs thro' the valey of the ſhadow of death, and bring us to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of eternal bliſs and glory! And by theſe means would the end of our Saviour's coming into the world be accompliſhed.</p>
