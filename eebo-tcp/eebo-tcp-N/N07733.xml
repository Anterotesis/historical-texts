            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>OR ſeveral years I have been a ſilent ſpectator of the political conduct of a particular faction in this province; I have obſerv'd how they have ruled in moſt public tranſactions; have handled the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic money, and diſpoſed of our lives and fortunes at pleaſure: I have ſeen this very faction raiſe the hue and cry about liberty, while they were ſtealing the poor remains of liberty from the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable inhabitants of the province: And I have now obſerv'd, that while the injur'd and diſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are crying for redreſs, they are endeavouring to plunge us into new ſchemes, in order to amuſe us; tho' the wound is ſtill bleeding of which we have complain'd. In ſuch a ſituation, ſilence would no longer become a friend of liberty and his country. And as our repreſentatives are gone home to conſult with their conſtituents, what is to be done in this conjuncture, I think we are now in a particular manner call'd upon to ſpeak out, and tell what we take to be the origin of all our troubles, and what is the beſt way to cure them. For my part, I am clearly perſuaded that Quaker politicks, and a Quaker faction,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:009875_0003_0F7AD24D8783D018"/>
have involv'd this province into almoſt all the contentions, and all the miſeries under which we have ſo long ſtruggled.</p>
            <p>There can never be a greater cauſe, perhaps no other cauſe of tumults and complaints in any government, than the people conceiving that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt laws are impoſed on them, and that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are purſued to which they did not conſent. This is the very caſe with the majority of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. They are depriv'd of their ſhare in le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlation; laws are made and impos'd on them, and meaſures are taken which they do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, and yet cannot prevent, becauſe they are not fairly repreſented in Aſſembly. This would be in any view, an intolerable grievance, as it deprives us of liberty; but that grievance is doubled, when we conſider that it is contrary to an expreſs ſtipulation in Charter, for which we left our native country, and came to this. howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wilderneſs.—This grievance is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all our trouble, and has its origin from Quakers. You, Gentlemen, ſoon perceiv'd that the majority of your people were come over at firſt, and that all future increaſe of this province would be of other denominations. The govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was in your hands, and that you might never looſe it, you reſolv'd to deprive all new Counties of their rights as Engliſhmen, and their rights by the Proprietor's charter: And you have ſo contrived it, that three Quaker counties may give laws to all the province, altho' it ſhould
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:009875_0004_0F7AD24E08445928"/>
contain fifteen counties. If you had not form'd new counties, the people now in thoſe counties muſt have voted amongſt you, and might have turn'd you out of power; but now you have made blanks of them for ever; and by this ſcheme they muſt ever wear ſuch a yoke as a Quaker may pleaſe to ſhape for them. If the province is to be protected, the principal of Non-Reſiſtance takes place, and we muſt protect your lives; but if money is to be rais'd, a very different principal takes place, and you will take care of our money. In this bleſſed ſituation we have jogg'd on, and call'd our ſelves Freemen. The poor ſun-burned African comes to a more deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſlavery in this province than we; for his maſter is at leaſt careful of his life; but ours diligently purſue ſuch practices as bring us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the laſt French war, you would not grant ſo much as £. 10,000 for his Majeſty's ſervice; you had not ſtarted your quarrel with the Proprietor then, but you plead conſcience, and that did as well. On account of ſuch conduct the Engliſh parliament had like to've turn'd you out of the Aſſembly for ever; but your Friends in London interceded, and come over to perſuade you to reſign; and reſign you did with great reluctance, juſt ſo as to make a ſham majority of other denominations in the Houſe: But ſome of the gentlemen that you choſe would not go heartily into your meaſures,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009875_0005_0F7AD24ECE19C978"/>
ſo you turned them out, and have put a great majority of Quakers in the Aſſembly again.<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Viz. 22 out of 36.</note> However tho', with much trouble his Majeſty obtained ſupplies; yet, like good engineers, you found a way to counter-plot him. It may not indeed become us who are ſlaves, to ſay this; but we may tell you, that his Majeſty's Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Lord L—n.</note> his Governor,<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Gr. D—y.</note> and his Agent for Indian affairs,<note n="(d)" place="bottom">Sir William J—n.</note> have ſaid that you <hi>invaded the King's prerogative royal,</hi> and <hi>preſume to treat with foreign princes,</hi> with whom we are at war; and <hi>act as moderators between the government and an independant people.</hi> From this conduct have flow'd thoſe ſtreams of innocent blood with which our frontiers have been drench'd for many years. Soon as war was proclaim'd with the Indians,<note n="(e)" place="bottom">By Gr. M—s.</note> you opened a correſpondence with them, you created a King among them,<note n="(f)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Tedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſcung;</hi> the Six Nations ſaid he was no King, till the white people made him one. See the firſt treaty at <hi>Eaſton.</hi>
               </note> and him you ſupported for ſeveral years as your Deputy-Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the Proprietor, and the poor inhabitants of our frontiers. You taught him to accuſe the Proprietor.<note n="(g)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Tedyuſcung</hi> confeſs'd this afterwards.—</note> The Indians alſo ſay, and we have much reaſon to believe it, that you perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to kill the frontier inhabitants.<note n="(h)" place="bottom">See <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rad Weiſer</hi>'s diary.—</note> It is certain, however, that you falſly<note n="(i)" place="bottom">This appear'd upon examining into the matter. See Sir WM. J—N's report.</note> perſuaded
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009875_0006_0F7AD24F86C05908"/>
them that they were cheated; and that was the proper way to make them kill the people: You attended at public treaties; procured a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of ſtate<note n="(k)" place="bottom">C—s T—n.</note> for your Indian King, and furniſh'd him with whatever was neceſſary for his purpoſes and your's. When the Governor complain'd of this treaſonable tampering and treating with Indians, you modeſtly told him that you would do it whether he was pleas'd with it or not; for you did not chuſe to leave the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor and King's agent to manage the buſineſs without you.<note n="(l)" place="bottom">This was done in an addreſs to the Governor, 1757.</note> We need not tell what blood this has coſt our province: The miſerable Dutch and Iriſh on the frontiers have felt your ſcourge, and the groans of many a thouſand widows and fatherleſs children which daily pierce the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, will tell it, as far as the Quaker-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Pennſylvania ſhall be known.</p>
            <p>In order yet to prove that you have abus'd the province, need I mention how the public money has been ſquandered away? You rais'd large ſums, but always granted them too late, as tho' on purpoſe that little might be done. Was ever half a million of money ſo conſumed as it has been in this province? It was not with our many troops; for a New-England colony has rais'd three times the number of troops, and yet never ſpent ſuch ſums of money. Does any man aſk
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009875_0007_0F7AD25052753840"/>
what is become of this money? Many a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds were ſpent in debating with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor about things that you knew he could not grant; many thouſands as bribes to G—r D—, to obtain iniquitous laws, and to pervert juſtice; many a thouſand to ſupport your friends, in order to maintain your faction; many a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand to murtherers, and his Majeſty's enemies; and a great many thouſands where Quakers alone can tell, tho' it may not ſuit them to tell: But hardly ever was a farthing given to ſupport the naked and periſhing frontier inhabitants; to whom the Indians that you fed, had left nothing but the miſerable life. And in this preſent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian war, it is notorious, that great ſums of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney were ſpent laſt ſummer, while the moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual endeavours were uſed to order matters ſo as to render no effectual ſervice to the poor and defenceleſs inhabitants. It is no wonder, as a Prime Miniſter lately informed us, that
<q>His Majeſty ſees through ſuch artifices.</q> 
               <note n="(m)" place="bottom">See Lord EG—T's <hi>Letter.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>In this manner you have tyranniz'd over the good people on the frontiers of this province.— If you might avail your ſelves of a friendſhip and trade with the Indians, no matter what mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries we ſuffer'd; if you might help the Indians to recover their lands from the Proprietor, no matter what became of the people who lived on thoſe lands: And ſuffer me to obſerve, this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:009875_0008_0F7AD2518D83DE90"/>
of yours, and not the price of lands, was the true cauſe of thouſands leaving this province. The Scots and Iriſh were rode by main force; and the unhappy Germans, being ignorant of our conſtitution, have been blindly led into your ſchemes, and patiently groan'd under the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, while their wives, their children, and all were periſhing by fire and hatchet.</p>
            <p>But when you find that the province is to be enſlav'd no longer; the frontier counties, almoſt to a man, inſiſt on having juſtice done them; the Hibernian winches beneath his yoke; the German, having loſt every thing elſe, begins to pray that you would ſpare his life:— In ſhort, the voice of miſery and diſtreſs is no longer to be ſtifled, now you propoſe to lead us another dance.</p>
            <p>The Proprietor is no more; by 26 very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and very modeſt Reſolves of the Houſe, you conceive him as dead as Harry the Eighth. So the helm muſt be clap'd hard to lee, and we ſhall be about in a jerk. Nothing elſe than a King's government will now ſuit the ſtomach of a Quaker politician: Not that you all love his Majeſty neither, for ſome of you would not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly give ſix-pence to ſupport his cauſe; many who now puſh for a King's government, have never paid a farthing of a tax for the King's uſe, but as their goods have been deſtrain'd. You would not take up arms for him, when his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions were at ſtake; not becauſe you are
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:009875_0009_0F7AD251F0DA3DA8"/>
mightily averſe from ſhedding blood; for we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw people have a better Goû for that buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs than ſome of you had, when his Majeſty's ſubjects were like to come in your way. But whether it proceeds from a love to his Majeſty, from a hatred of the Proprietor, from ſome hopes of keeping the people under a Quaker-yoke for ever by this ſcheme, or from a deſire to throw down the whole fabric together, if you muſt fall,—whatever is the motive,—you are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd on having a King's government.</p>
            <p>But as our Aſſembly adjourn'd without grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any ſupplies, in order to conſult their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituents (of whom you are at preſent no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part) whether we ſhall petition his Majeſty to take this government under his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate care, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as we find you are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding this petition with great vigour, we would humbly beg to know whether it might not be conſiſtent with Quaker politicks, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct your Repreſentatives to prepare the Supply Bill firſt, ſo that it may paſs; and petition af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, if neceſſary. If the Bill be unjuſt, they may proteſt againſt the oppreſſion, and give the Proprietor as many ſur-names as they pleaſe; but at the ſame time raiſe troops for the ſecurity of the miſerable inhabitants; his Majeſty will not be the leaſt more unwilling to take care of us, upon hearing that we have rais'd money for the ſupport of his ſubjects, tho' we ſhould do it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der oppreſſive circumſtances; I ſhould think that
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:009875_0010_0F7AD252A4A1FDA0"/>
ſuch an action would rather recommend us to his Majeſty; unleſs perhaps he might think that while we were acting wiſely, we had no occaſion for new Governors. For my part, I can ſee but one objection to paſſing the Supply Bill, under thoſe circumſtances, and that is, the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary expence to which it will put the province.— If the Proprietor's located uncultivated lands be taxed at only £. 5 <hi>per</hi> hundred acres, it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce his ſhare of the preſent ſupply about £. 110 lower than it ſhould be, according to the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly's plan: That whole ſum will fall upon the inhabitants of the province, which will be almoſt the third part of a farthing for every inhabitant, and all we ſhould get in return for this great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, would be protecting the lives and fortunes of the frontier inhabitants: For, ſuppoſe we ſhould grant no ſupplies during the ſeaſon, we may compute that the Indians would kill about 900; make ſlaves of about 1100; and, wound, baniſh, and reduce to beggary about 13000:— So you ſee all that we get by the extra expence of £. 110, is the proſpect of ſaving fifteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of his Majeſty's ſubjects from beggary, cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity and death; which would make each one of them coſt us about ſeven farthings. But it may be a queſtion with ſome, whether the life of a Dutch or Iriſh man, be worth ſo much?—</p>
            <p>But if you will not urge the Aſſembly to paſs the Supply Bill, I beg that you would at leaſt ſend another meſſenger to the Indians; acquaint

them that we hope by next winter to import a new Governor, and then we ſhall look them in the face; but in the mean time, as we are not in tune for making any defence, it will not be fair to meddle with us; but if they inſiſt on conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing the murther and ravages which they began a few days ago, tell them that we have computed their chance, and on the condition that they will not wound, plunder and baniſh any more for the ſeaſon, we ſhall agree quietly to give up 3000 frontier inhabitants, whom they may kill, and eat if they pleaſe; for ſome of your writers <note n="(n)" place="bottom">See the Letter that Chief Juſtice R—D ſigned.</note> have made it plain, that it's no matter what the Indians do with a man after they have kill'd him.—By this bargain with the Indians, you will ſave from baniſhment, and perhaps dying with hunger, about 13000 innocent people; which, we apprehend, would be as great a proof of your loyalty, as you have given for many years.—The thing is practicable enough; there are Indians in town, whom you may ſend on this meſſage; and if the Governor ſhould not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of it, you may ſend without his approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as 'tis ſaid you lately did.</p>
            <p>We are all this time taking it for granted, that the Proprietor is to be kick'd off the Stage; but let us now ſee what has been his fault: He deſires that his located, uncultivated lands, be tax'd at five per cent: And is there not a very expreſs decree to that purpoſe? It ſeems unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:009875_0012_0F7AD254F3C94F18"/>
to me, why the Proprietor ſhould be blamed for what the King in Council has done; and ſtill more ſurpriſing, that we ſhould abuſe him for a thing that we have already approv'd by our Agent; if the decree was unjuſt, ſhould not we have complained then; have repreſented the great Difference of the Prices of Land, and the ſingular goodneſs of the Proprietor's Land? It is ſtrange that we ſhould have to quarrel in this province, at the expence of ſo much Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and danger of ſo many lives, about a Thing that ſhould have been ſettled in England long ago. We conceive that we have ſpent about ten thouſand pounds already, upon an embaſſy to London; but if that ſum was not enough to get buſineſs well done, let us ſend again, and ſpend three times as much: We ſeem to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for it; but in the mean Time, don't let us avenge our blunders on the Proprietor. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that he has done wrong, in ſelling his Lands too dear, or in reſerving ſome of the beſt to himſelf, how will the Matter be mended by geting a King's Governor? Shall we then make laws to force the Proprietor to take up the worſt Land? (for he has a right to ſome) Or ſhall we force him to ſell his property at whatever price we chooſe to give? Shall we prevent him from leting his friends have land? Or, ſhall we force him to refund the fourſcore thouſand pounds which we gave to his Governors? Is he alſo to refund the thouſands which Governor D— re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd

as bribes, to injure the Proprietor? And beſides that, is the new Governor, and all the retinue and dependants that may follow him, to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed upon the air? If this be the ſcheme, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue it on; but if theſe things be impracticable, I cannot ſee how we ſhall get our preſent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion mended.</p>
            <p>I expect to be told, I am not well affected to his Majeſty, as you ſaid of ſome Preſbyterians t'other day at the State-Houſe, becauſe they would not plunge themſelves blindly into your meaſures: I ſuppoſe, however, they are very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different about ſuch malicious accuſations. In ſpite of all you can ſay, his Majeſty will judge of your loyalty, and theirs, according to the <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial</hi> proofs you give of it, in time of danger; and not by your idle gaſconade at a State-houſe. What under the heavens did your ſpeaker mean, by telling us that the Proprietor has made us all ſlaves, and will preſently bring our heads to the block? Can the Proprietor take away our lives, or our liberties? Have we not got a valuable Charter? Don't we make our own laws, and ſit as juries to determine upon life and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, according to theſe laws? The danger is from another quarter; you are the perſons that have made us ſlaves; you have depriv'd us of charter-privileges; have made laws for us, and have offer'd to deprive us of juries, ſo that you might have the power to ſpare our lives, or take them away, at pleaſure. Did the Proprietor
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:009875_0014_0F7AD2565E36C590"/>
ever attempt ſuch a thing? You aſcribe all our contentions and trouble to the Proprietor, with the ſame juſtice that you do our ſlavery: Your non-reſiſting principle began our troubles, and your obſtinacy continued them. You refus'd to grant his Majeſty ſupplies in Governor THOMAS's time, but the Governor was obliged to take the men; and through obſtinacy you ſunk ten or twelve thouſand pounds. What ſhare of blame had the Proprietor in that affair? When you had loſt your hold in the corporation of this city, the Governor would not aſſiſt you to be aveng'd of your ſucceſſors; for which you never forgave him. Was the Proprietor to be blam'd for that quarrel? In the beginning of the late French war, you plead conſcience, or unbelief, or ſomething worſe, and would grant no ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies. Was the Proprietor to blame there?— But the Proprietor urged you then ſo hard, to come into ſome meaſures of defence, that you never forgave him ſince. And as you were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards obliged to grant ſupplies, you reſolv'd to manage your cards ſo as to give him but little eaſe.</p>
            <p>And we contend, that if our Aſſembly had, ten years ago, conſiſted of men ſincerely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſerve his Majeſty and their country, by defenſive meaſures, we might have avoided moſt of all our quarrels with the Governor; and ſhould at the ſame time have ſav'd this province one hundred and fifty thouſand pounds, at leaſt, and many thouſand lives.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:009875_0015_0F7AD2571467D8B0"/>How many thouſand pounds did it coſt us to get the Indians to charge the Proprietor with all our trouble? Even to accuſe him with the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt fraud,—of producing falſe records. But when the matter was enquir'd into, it was plain that the accuſations were falſe, and that you had ſet the Indians on.</p>
            <p>Sir W—M J—N, in his report of theſe proceedings, mentions ſeveral Quakers who had correſponded with the Indians, and been guilty of ſeveral ſeditious and treaſonable practices: Yet you are ſtill diſpoſed to fling all our calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties on the Proprietor. It is notorious that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor looſes greatly by the depopulation and ſlavery of the frontier counties; but you are the perſons who gain by it; for the fewer the new counties are, the more likely the Quakers are to hold their power in this province. Yet we are told<note n="(o)" place="bottom">By J— G—y, <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
               </note> that the Proprietor has made ſlaves of us all, and will preſently (make us lords, and) bring us to the block. A curious politician is this ſame orator of your's.— We are told that the change is eaſy, from Proprietary-Slavery to Royal-Liberty. It is a pity the change were not eaſy, from Quaker-Slavery to Britiſh-Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For my part, I cannot ſee what you mean, by talking as if we were not already under his Majeſty's government:— We conceive that we are under it; and are ready to ſpend the laſt drop of blood, rather than ſubmit to any other Sovereign: That's more than you can ſay.—
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:009875_0016_0F7AD257D78299B8"/>
The Proprietor is our Governor under the King, and he nominates a Lieutenant-Governor for his Majeſty's approbation. Can this circumſtance ever be mended? It is impoſſible his Majeſty ſhould be acquainted with the many thouſand of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers who are in his ſervice. Even in a King's government we muſt expect to have a Governor whom ſome body has recommended to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. My Lord Some-body has a friend, who has a couſin, who needs a place, or ſtands in ſome other body's way: Him he recommends to the prime miniſter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo we may come by a Governor. And the queſtion now is, Who ſhall recommend our Governor to his Majeſty; ſhall the Proprietor? who muſt naturally be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of the growth of this province; or muſt ſome Nobleman or other? who, perhaps, knows and cares little about it.</p>
            <p>We have had one trial already of a Governor the Proprietor did not chuſe to recommend, <hi>i. e.</hi> Governor D—Y. We know he oblig'd you much: And a few ſuch Governors would do for us all.—But the change of a Governor is not the only thing we are to expect; if we muſt have a change, we ſhall have a thorough one. For if we get a new government, the Parliament muſt alter our Charter firſt, and then we ſhall have new privileges and new laws. We know what we have, and we can hardly get better, but we may get worſe, when it will be too late to repent. It is very probable that we ſhall ſoon have ſtamp-offices,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:009875_0017_0F7AD258863C2930"/>
cuſtoms, exciſes and duties enough to pay, we don't want to pay tythes into the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. —Our preſent Charter is a very good one, if you would ſuffer the people to enjoy it: But you ſeem reſolv'd to enſlave us, either in one go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment or another. You privately inſtructed your Agent in England, to make terms for you. You were preparing, like the <hi>unjuſt ſteward,</hi> that in caſe you ſhould be turn'd out of power in this government, you might immediately plunge us into a new government, where you ſhould reign again: And doubtleſs a Quaker's finger would then be heavier than his loins have been hitherto. The anſwer that you got from Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, was that you might be able to get the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment changed,
<q>The Quakers ſtill retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their power.</q>
A very comfortable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer! —But if the people of this province ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you thus to lead them blind-fold into a new ſyſtem, they will very well deſerve to be rid.— You have the power at preſent of making any laws for us that you pleaſe, and you would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ſame power in the new government, for your ſcheme is not to grant the frontier-counties any Repreſentatives before this change. Thus, bound hand and feet, we are to be delivered up!</p>
            <p>If you are really deſirous to do this province a ſervice and make the people happy, your only way is to grant them their privileges, let them be fairly repreſented in Aſſembly; and then when they are free men, if they deſire a change
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:009875_0018_0F7AD25947C22520"/>
of government, let them petition; but ſooner by no means.— Suffer me to ſay, that when there are petitions before the Aſſembly from two or three thouſand frontier inhabitants, and more daily coming in, praying for redreſs of grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that at ſuch a time to puſh for a new go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, inſtead of letting the people be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs'd; ſuch conduct, I ſay, and at ſuch a time, will admit of conſtructions very diſhonorable to your ſociety.</p>
            <p>It is cruel to deprive people of their liberties, and when they cry for juſtice, immediately to raiſe a counter-cry, and ſet the province in a ferment about another affair, leſt the groans of the injur'd ſhould be heard. Therefore, inſtead of liſtening to new ſchemes, I am reſolv'd, and hope that every lover of this province and of liberty, will reſolve to liſten to no propoſals for a change of government, until juſtice is done to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd, the oppreſs'd and groaning inhabitants of our frontier-counties.—</p>
