            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>We are further to acquaint you, That these delays of yours do very much hinder the necessary Affairs of their Majesties here: His Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency has no directions nor instructions from the King to make any applications to your selves; he has not publisht his Commission until he did it in this Court; nor could he suppose, neither will it be believed in <hi>England</hi> that an English Collony should deny the Rights of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant King.</p>
                  <p>The Letters from <hi>Albany</hi> do still intimate, That they are apprehensive that they will be attacked by the Enemy, and if that Post should be lost for want of your Complyance to their Majesties Commission, you may be sensible of what dangerous <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  <p>The <hi>Jarseys</hi> are under the same Circumstances with your selves, in respect of their Charter, yet have willingly submitted to the Kings plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and Right of the Millitia, who are commanded by his Excellency; the Governour of that Collony acts there without the least interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: He calls Assemblies, makes Laws, raises Money, ordains and keeps Courts, only commands the Militia under his Excellency, who has not altered one single Officer in that Collony.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> We are to conclude with the last thing his Excellency gave us in charge, That the fatal Consequences of your Proceedures, as it appears to his Excellency, will be repented by you and your Posterity when 'tis too late: You are the only People in all the Kings Dominions that will venture to dispute with our King, who is a Souldier, concerning that inherent Right of the Militia, settled upon the Crown by several Acts of Parliament, and cannot be aliened nor demised.</p>

            <p>Upon the delivery of the above Memorial, the general Court dispersed, and returned no Answer.</p>
            <p>During his Excellency's stay at <hi>Hartford</hi> he had twice Conference with Governour <hi>Treat,</hi> Secretary <hi>Allyn,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pitkin</hi> and Mr. Stanley, who attended his Excellency at his Lodging. His Excellency having heard what they had to say, answered their several Arguments, in particular to their Allegations, That they had enjoyed their Militia the two last Reigns, and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               <p>You are permitted by your Charter, in case of eminent Danger, to arm and array the Subjects of this Collony, but I do not find you are impowered to give Commissions and keep up a standing Militia.</p>
               <p>I do therefore require you, Coll. <hi>Treat,</hi> to give Obedience to this Commission, and I do tender you the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
