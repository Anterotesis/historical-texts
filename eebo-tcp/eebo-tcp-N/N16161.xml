            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>GARDENING at the perfection to which it has been advanced, in many parts of the world, is entitled to a place of considerable rank among the liberal Arts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As there is no doubt that with care and attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, almost every species of vegetables may be propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated in this climate to as great perfection as in any part of the universe; it is to be hoped that every improvement which can possibly be suggested, in the infant state of Horticulture in this country, will meet with every possible degree of encouragement; more especially when we call to mind the many ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries and conveniencies of life which are derived to us from the produce of the garden; and how su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabundantly the assiduous labourer is here reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the exuberance of vegetation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Under such persuasion, and from the repeated so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations of many reputable characters in this and the adjoining States,</hi> R. SQUIBB<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>has been induced to submit to the perusal of the Public the following Epitom of</hi> GARDENING, <hi>which is founded on expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and observation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This being his first Essay, he flatters himself that the candid Public will overlook any trifling mistake or inaccuracy that may possibly occur to their notice; and the more so, as his attention (since the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of the undertaking) has been greatly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
<pb facs="unknown:020722_0005_0FB0E3A921C48FD0"/>
through the urgent application of his friends, to the pursuit of his manual profession; and his fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble efforts in the intervals only have been exerted to point out, in a plain, concise and familiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the most beneficial rules (to the utmost of his practice, knowledge and abilities) peculiarly adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the climate, and most agreeable to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral system of Horticulture, throughout every mouth in the year—in doing of which be candidly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges to have followed, as much as possible, the method and style of a justly admired European Gard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ener.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>However mysterious some propositions in this work may appear to his readers respecting foreign seeds, and some other deviations from the usual practice, which the variation of climate makes necessary; let them be assured, that what is here laid down, has been the result of much experience, which no theori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ideas can confute—he having studied with atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the soils and seasons, best calculated for sowing and planting the most useful vegetables, &amp;c. adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, or peculiar to this country.</hi>

                  <head>BEANS.</head>
                  <p>IN the beginning of this month, if the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is open, let some ground be got ready for a principal crop of broad beans. The best sorts are—</p>
                  <p>The windsor bean, sandwich bean, toker bean, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The windsor bean is an excellent sort, and may be planted the first week in this month; also the toker, which is very fine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a good bearer. Let the rows be four
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:020722_0009_0FB0E3B2C5487678"/>
feet distant from each other; and set the beans either with a blunt ended dibble, two or three inches deep, or drill them that depth; and about five or six inches asunder in the rows.</p>
                  <p>If you have not planted any mazagon and long podded beans before this month; let some of the two sorts be planted as early as possible—you may plant the mazagon, long podded, and windsor beans all at the same time; and they will succeed each other in bearing.</p>
                  <p>The mazagon bean should be planted in rows two feet asunder, and four inches dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in the rows; and the long pods two feet and a half or three feet from row to row, and six or seven inches in the row.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="task">
                  <head>PEAS.</head>
                  <p>Let some early hotspur peas be sown the beginning of this month for a full crop, in a warm piece of ground, to succeed the same sorts sown in the two last months—the sorts are—</p>
                  <p>Charleton, hotspur, golden hotspur, Essex hotspur, &amp;c. but the two first are the earliest, and the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is proper to succeed them; sow each sort in rows four feet asunder; if the ground is rich, and you intend to set sticks for their support—but, if you do not intend to give them sticks; three feet will be sufficient.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="unknown:020722_0010_0FB0E3B466FD6260"/>
At the same time also you may sow the first crop of marrowfat peas, and they will succeed the hotspur, for they will come into bearing as the others go off. This pea is much admired in most families<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the dwarf marrowfat is the properest for sowing at this season; observing, if you intend to set sticks for those peas to run upon, to sow them in rows five feet distant from each other—but, if no sticks are intended, three feet and a half will afford space enough.</p>
                  <p>If you have pease and beans, already ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced two or three inches high or more, take the advantage of a fine day, when the surface of the ground is dry, and draw some earth up to their stems.</p>
                  <p>This should not be omitted; for it will strengthen the plants, and protect them great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against the frost and wind.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="task">
                  <head>CABBAGES</head>
                  <p>About the beginning, middle, or any time in this month, you may sow early York, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar-loaf and drum-head cabbage-seed, to come in for summer use—for this purpose, chuse a warm border, under a wall or fence—Dig the ground a spade deep, throw it up into a bed or beds, sow the seed pretty thick, and rake the surface even—should severe weather set in, you may throw a little light litter or straw over the beds, before or after the plants are up.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="unknown:020722_0011_0FB0E3BB750B25B8"/>
If your cabbage-plants, sown in October or November, were not transplanted last month, let them be put out soon in this. Let the ground be well manured with good rotten dung, and dig it in a full spade deep, if the land will bear it. Rake the ground smooth, and plant your drumhead or large cabbage plants two feet and a half distant from row to row, and the same distance in the rows....[See December.]</p>
               </div>
               <div type="task">
                  <head>CAULIFLOWERS.</head>
                  <p>Let every care be taken to protect your cauliflowers from frost—This may be done by binding moss or hay bands round the stems, and about one third of the leaves, and tying the leaves together near the tops.</p>
                  <p>About the middle of this month, you may transplant the cauliflowers sown in October, if they are of full size to transplant. Let these plants be put out into a warm situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in a spot of rich soil well manur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with good rotten dung; and plant them about two feet and a half distant from row to row, and two feet in the rows.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="task">
                  <head>BROCCOLI.</head>
                  <p>Let your broccoli have frequent hoeings; and let the decayed leaves be taken away as they fall off, which are no ways pleasing to the eye.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="task">
                  <pb n="5" facs="unknown:020722_0012_0FB0E3BD49BA18D8"/>
                  <head>TURNIPS.</head>
                  <p>About the latter end of this month, sow a few dutch turnips, for an early crop—if they succeed they will come in about the beginning of April, and will be exceeding good.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="task">
                  <head>BEETS.</head>
                  <p>Sow beets about the latter end of this month, of different sorts, the red beet for a large root, and the green and white sorts, for their leaves in soup, stewing, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Beet seed being pretty large it is an eligible method, either to sow it in drills, in order that it may be more regularly buried in the earth, at an equal depth; or to dot it in with a blunt ended dibble in rows—Let the drills be drawn with a hoe, about an inch and a half deep, and ten or twelve inches asunder—Divide the ground into beds five feet wide, put three or four seeds into each hole, and cover them in as you go on; and after the plants are come up some time, leave only one of the strongest in each hole.</p>
                  <p>It will be most proper to sow the red and the other sorts separate; for it is the root of the red sort only that is used; and the leaves of the white and green kinds.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="task">

                  <head>CARROTS.</head>
                  <p>When the weather is mild and dry, at any time in this month, let a warm spot of ground be prepared for a few early carrots—Dig the ground a full spade deep, and break the earth well as you go on.</p>
                  <p>This is only intended for a few to come in a little before the general crop; therefore only a small piece of ground should be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for this purpose—Choose a dry mild day to sow the feed; and you may sow a thin sprinkling of radishes with the carrots; and let them be raked in soon; always ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving to divide the ground into beds from four to five feet in width.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="task">
                  <head>ONIONS.</head>
                  <p>Let your onions have frequent hoeings; and let the surface of the ground be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly kept loose, which will greatly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their growth.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="task">
                  <head>SPINAGE.</head>
                  <p>On a small spot of ground you may sow a little spinage, to come early in the spring, at which time it will be very acceptable in most families; the smooth-leaved or round seeded is the best to sow at this season.</p>
                  <p>The seed may be sown about the middle or toward the latter end of this month, either in the broad cast, and raked in; or in broad, flat, shallow drills, drawn with a hoe flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:020722_0014_0FB0E3C0D1B40738"/>
about an inch deep, and a foot asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; or you may sow it in drills between rows of early beans and peas.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="task">
                  <head>PARSLEY.</head>
                  <p>Sow some parsley seed in open weather, about the middle or towards the end of this month.</p>
                  <p>There are two kinds of parsley, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon plain, and curl-leaved, but the latter is greatly to be prefered; the leaves being large, thick, and bushy, and excellent for culinary uses, and much admired for garnish to dishes. Let shallow drills be drawn in a dry part of the garden, and sow the seeds therein pretty thick, and cover them about half an inch deep with earth.</p>
                  <p>These seeds may be sown in a single drill round the edges of the kitchen garden quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or along the edges of the borders next the paths—This seed lies in the ground some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a month or six weeks before it makes its appearance.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="task">
                  <head>LETTUCES.</head>
                  <p>Transplant some more lettuces from the beds or borders where they stand too close together—In doing this, observe to draw the plants out regularly, and let the strongest remain in the bed or border ten or twelve inches distance; then loosen the surface of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:020722_0015_0FB0E3C28BF7B0B0"/>
the earth with a hoe, and clear away the weeds and litter.</p>
                  <p>The plants which are taken out, should be planted in a warm border of rich earth, at ten or twelve inches distance each way; and if the weather is dry let them have a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle water.</p>
                  <p>Cabbage, Silesia, and Dutch brown lettuce may be sown at any time in this month in a sheltered situation, in a spot of light rich earth, open to the sun.</p>
                  <p>Pick off all dead and decayed leaves as they appear on the plants, and keep them perfectly clear of weeds; and if you stir the surface of the earth between the plants some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it will be of service to them.</p>

               <div type="task">
                  <head>CELLERY.</head>
                  <p>When the weather is open take the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of a dry day to earth up such cellery as require it.</p>
                  <p>Let the earth be well broken and laid up to the plants lightly, that they may not be crushed down or bruised, raising the earth near to the top of the plants; should severe frost set in, it will injure part of the tops of the plants that are above ground; and if much of the plants should be out of ground in such weather, and be thereby destroyed, it will also occasion a decay of those parts that are within the ground—Therefore it may

be necessary to cover the rows with long litter, straw, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>In the beginning, or any time this month when the weather is open and mild, sow some short top radishes for an early crop, on a warm border that lies well to the sun, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a wall or fence—and about the latter end you may sow the same sort, and some salmon radishes, to succeed them.</p>
                  <p>You should not mix both sorts together, but let each sort be sown by itself, for the short top will come in ten or twelve days
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:020722_0017_0FB0E3C807ADBA90"/>
sooner than the salmon radishes; and the short top are much more hardy than the salmon—</p>
                  <p>The surest method is to sow some short top at least twice or oftner in this month—therefore if you sow some about the beginning, and again at the middle, and towards the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of the month, in a warm situation you will seldom fail of success.</p>
                  <p>There may be mixed and sown with the radishes a sprinkling of carrot seed; for if the radishes should fail, the carrots may succeed; and if both succeed, there will be a double advantage—for when the radishes are drawn off for use, there remains a crop of carrots, which will come in at an early period; or, instead of carrots, you may sow a little lettuce seed or round spinnage, and when the radish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es are gone off these will come in.</p>
                  <p>You should sow your radish seeds pretty thick at this season; for when the radish seeds begin to appear, if the weather should prove sharp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it will cut some off, and the birds too will be apt to attack them and destroy many; sow the seeds regularly over the surface, and throw the ground up into beds, about four or four feet and a half wide, and rake the surface even, standing in the alleys—Should there be any appearance of frost after the seed is sown, it will be proper to spread some dry straw or litter over the surface, an inch or two thick; which will keep the surface
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:020722_0018_0FB0E3CA9B8CEEC8"/>
warm, prevent the injury of the frost, and greatly forward the germination of the seed—</p>
                  <p>Likewise when the plants begin to appear, the same precaution will be necessary to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect them from the frost, by spreading a little straw or litter over the surface, there to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main till they are fairly up—and if the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proves frosty afterwards, cover them with a little straw, or some light ever green bushes, which may be continued occasionally; by which means the plants will be greatly forwarded in their growth: for should cold north wet winds prevail in the day time, the bushes will break the wind, which is almost as hurtful to them as the frost: but this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering must not by any means be kept on in mild, but only in severe weather, until the plants are fairly in rough leaves.</p>

                  <p>This plant is propagated by cuttings, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taken off the top an inch or two long,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:020722_0019_0FB0E3CBB41BEB88"/>
or from the old roots cut in pieces of that length—but the top or crown of the plant is most preferable. The method is this —</p>
                  <p>First procure a quantity of proper sets;—which may be either the small off-sets that arise from the sides of the main roots, of which take cuttings off their tops, an inch or two long; or you may use the tops of the crowns of the old roots, when taken up for use: or in default of a sufficiency of crowns or tops of either, you may divide a quantity of old knotty roots into cuttings of two inch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es long; which, if furnished each with two or three buds or eyes, will make tollerable sets. When you intend to make a fresh plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, you should, during the winter, when you take up the plants for use, reserve all the best crowns of the main roots for planting. But this latter practice can only be pursued in private gardens: for where the large roots are for sale, their tops must not be taken off, which would render them unsaleable in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket: therefore the Market Gardeners reserve the strongest off-sets arising from the main root.</p>
                  <p>Being thus furnished with a proper quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of sets, proceed to prepare the ground for their reception. And they may either be p<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>nted with a dibble, after the ground is dug; or trenched in, as you proceed in dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ground.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="unknown:020722_0020_0FB0E3CD133910F8"/>
Choose an open situation, and as light and deep a soil as the Garden affords; which must be trenched regularly one good spade deep at least; but if the ground will admit of it, the deeper it is loosened the better.</p>
                  <p>Then proceed by dibble planting, in the following manner, being provided with a long dibble, begin at one end of the piece of ground—range the line cross-ways; and with the dibble make holes about fifteen inches deep; and be careful to make them all of an equal depth; which you may readily do by making a mark upon the dibble. and so thrusting it down to that mark: makeing the holes six inches asunder, dropping as you go on, one set or cutting into each hole, with the crown, &amp;c. upwards; taking care to fill or close the hole properly with earth—the rows to be one foot six inches asunder.</p>
                  <p>The other method of planting, by trench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the sets, is, to open a trench at one end, in the common method of trenching, two spades wide and one spade deep or more; and then having the sets or cuttings provided, plant one row along the bottom of the trench with the crowns upright, about six inches asunder; then dig the next trench the same depth and width, turning the earth into the first trench, over the row of sets; thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, trench after trench, to the end.</p>
                  <p>By practising either of the above methods of planting horse-radish, the sets will put
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:020722_0021_0FB0E3CE79AAD910"/>
forth perfectly straight-rooted shoots quite to the top; whereby they will be long and smooth, and swell evenly their whole length, and will sometimes attain a tolerable perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the first summer's growth.</p>
                  <p>When the whole is planted, the ground may be sown with spinage or radishes, which will come off time enough to give the horse radish full time to grow—for these will not come up till the first or middle of April, when the spinage and radishes will be all gathered.</p>
                  <p>They must be kept weeded for a month of six weeks, after which the leaves will co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the ground, and prevent the growth of weeds.</p>
                  <p>In the autumn after planting, or about michaelmas, you may begin to take up some of the roots, if wanted for use: but it will be adviseable to let the principal part remain, to have another summer's growth, when they will be very fine and large.</p>
                  <p>When you take up these roots, it should be done regularly—not digging up a stick here and there, as is often practised in private gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens; but beginning at the first row, and so proceeding from row to row, according as you want them: observing to throw out a trench close along the first row of roots, and as deep as the roots go, but not to loosen the bottom or old set from whence these proceed, which is called the stool.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="unknown:020722_0022_0FB0E3D002E257A0"/>
Having thus cleared away the earth quite close to the stool or bottom of the roots, then with a knife out each root off level, close to the stool from whence it proceeds ‐ for all the stools or bottoms of the roots must be left in the ground undisturbed; for these will yield a supply of fine roots, the succeeding year—and when the roots are dug up, the old stools still remaining will continue as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as the produce is gathered, to furnish a fresh supply of roots every succeeding year.</p>
                  <p>But care must be taken, when digging up the roots, always to clear the old stool from all straggling or small roots whatever; and in the summer season to draw up all the small plants rising between the rows.</p>

                  <p>PRUNING may be performed on these Trees any time in this month.</p>
                  <p>In doing this business, you are to observe, that although the trees were pruned last summer, there will still remain many bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which ought to be taken out — The most irregular and most abundant of them are to be cut away, and a due supply of the best-placed and most moderate, strong
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:020722_0023_0FB0E3D41E1E6F18"/>
shoots are to be preserved, in every part, at proper distances — For these trees produce their fruit principally from their former sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's shoots.</p>
                  <p>The old naked branches, having no young shoots on them, should be entirely taken out: which you will frequently meet with in old standard trees; particularly in their lower and middle limbs. The cause is chiefly ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to neglect of pruning, in due season; for the upper branches crowding over the lower and middle ones, destroy their fertility.</p>
                  <p>Therefore in pruning these trees, let some of the old naked wood be cut away in every winter's pruning, to make room for the last summer's shoots; and where the branches of the trees are too crowded, let them be thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; observing to take off such as grow most i regularly: and when any branches run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cross, or interfere much with any of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in an improper direction, let them be cut out. But a due supply should be left e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where, at moderate distances, to bear fruit the next summer; and all such as are not wanted must be cut away quite close, leaving only the short spurs.</p>
                  <p>The weaker shoots, which are now left, must, at the same time, be shortened, more or less, according to the vigour of the tree, and strength of the different shoots; which is done in order to procure an effectual supply
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:020722_0024_0FB0E3D78E643440"/>
of new shoots next year, to bear fruit the year following.</p>
                  <p>But in shortening the shoots, mind to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion every one, according to it's growth, and original length. For instance—A shoot of about a foot long, may be shortened to six or seven inches, according to it's strength; and one from fifteen to eighteen inches, may be shortened to about twelve; and one from two to three feet, need not be shortened at all, if the strength is in proportion to it's length. And you will even find sometimes shoots of a foot long that require no shorten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, observing always to leave the strongest and largest shoots.</p>
                  <p>The general rule for shortening the shoots of young trees, after the first year's planting, is, if they are very strong and vigorous, you may shorten them one fourth; if pretty strong, one third; and if weak, cut off two thirds. Observe to prune out side branches, that are above an inch long; and leave none but the main shoots on the trees—As to the number of the branches, I refer you to head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down young trees.—[See March.]</p>
                  <p>But such peach, nectarine, and apricot trees, as produce strong and vigorous shoots must be treated accordingly, and must also be shortened less in proportion; and the stronger the branches are, the more room they should have.—When the tree is pruned,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:020722_0025_0FB0E3D9003C16D0"/>
the branches should be at least from sixteen to eighteen inches distant from each other, at the extremity of each shoot; but indeed some of the most vigorous shoots should not be shortened at all—This is the only method of pruning, to bring a vigorous shooting tree in good order, so as to produce moderate shoots, such as will bear fruit.</p>
                  <p>For the more wood you cut out, and in proportion as the shoots are shortened, the more vigorous the trees will become.</p>
                  <p>By what I have above hinted, the pruner will not be at a loss to know in what manner peach, nectarine, and apricot trees, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their different growth are to be treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In the article of pruning, the rule here mentioned is always to be applied to win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter prunings.</p>
                  <p>Another thing is also proper to be observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that is, where any young shoots, which are left to bear, have produced only small shoots from their sides, they must be cut off close to the principal, for those will neither produce good fruit, nor good wood.</p>
                  <p>It is proper to direct also, in shortening the shoots, to cut them off as much as possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at a leaf or wood bud, distinguishable from the blossom buds, by being long and flat; the others being round and swelling: or otherwise to prune to a twain blossom bud, that is where two buds arise at the same eye,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:020722_0026_0FB0E3DA8691D6C8"/>
having a wood bud between them. Either of these rules are necessary to be observed in shortening; in order that each may produce a leading shoot next summer, forming a lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the main shoots. For where there is a fair leading shoot provided near the extremity of a bearing branch, such shoot seldom fails to yield a fair and well flavoured fruit.</p>
                  <p>It will be also necessary to remark one thing more in pruning of these trees; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the apricot—In this tree we often perceive in the two year old branches, some short shoots or spurs, on which are frequently to be seen several blossom buds: now some people cut these spurs entirely off, but I am much against such practice; for some of these short natural spurs will produce handsome fruit, both in apricots, peaches, and nectarines, but especially the former.</p>

                  <p>Prune rasberries—In doing this let it be observed, that all the old wood that produced fruit last summer must now be cut out; for these never bear but once.—Therefore a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of young wood must be left to bear next year; observe therefore to leave several of the strongest of the last summer's shoots standing upon every root, to bear the fruit to be expected next year.—These being the only proper bearing shoots, they must be allowed room; therefore as above hinted, let all the old wood be cut close to the ground; and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting from three to five of the best young shoots on each root or stool, let all the rest above that number be cut away close to the surface of the earth; and at the same time let all straggling roots be destroyed.</p>
                  <p>Each of the shoots that are left to bear must be shortened—the rule is this.—Take off one third or one fourth or thereabouts of the original length of each shoot, according to the different growths.</p>

                  <p>Having procured the plants, shorten the shoots a little, and leave only one of the strongest shoots on each root—Let the ends of the roots be also trimmed; then put the plants in rows four or five feet distant, and let them be planted half a yard distant from each other in the rows.</p>

                  <p>The seed may at this season be sown ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a spot alone, or with other crops; particularly, between rows of windsor beans, or between cabbages, or with radishes, &amp;c. observing that, either alone or with other crops, spinage seed should be sown pretty thick, and generally in the broad cast—Let it be evenly raked.—Or you may otherwise

                  <p>This plant is to be propagated, either by parting the root, or by the slips of the young plants, taken up with roots or fibres at the bottom; or by the cuttings of the young stalks next month, or in April, &amp;c. But at this season the increasing it by slips or parting the roots is most generally practised—and the method is this:</p>
                  <p>Having procured the roots let them be planted in rows about six inches asunder, and five of six inches distant in the rows; and if the weather is dry let them have a tolerable watering, to settle the earth about their roots.</p>

                  <p>The method of propogating by roots is this: Having procured a sufficient quantity of old roots, draw drills with a hoe six inches asunder, extend the roots or runners along the bottom of the drills; cover them about an inch deep with the earth, and then make the ground even.</p>

                  <head>PLANTING ASPARAGUS.</head>
                  <p>Any time in this month is a very proper season to remove the roots of asparagus, for the making of new plantations.</p>
                  <p>In the doing of which, the chief matter to be regarded is the choice of a proper soil; which should be the best and deepest the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den affords: it must not be too wet, nor too strong or stubborn; but such as is moderately light and pliable; so that it will readily fall to pieces in digging, raking, &amp;c. and in a situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is open, and enjoys the full sun.</p>
                  <p>The ground where you intend to make new asparagus beds should be regularly trenched or dug to a good depth; and a large quantity of rotten dung buried in each trench, at least ten or twelve inches below the surface of the ground.</p>
                  <p>The ground being dug and laid level, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide it into beds three feet in width, with al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys about twenty inches wide between<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bed and bed.</p>
                  <p>Two rows of these roots are to be planted on each bed, allowing about sixteen or eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen inches between each plant; and let the rows be about eighteen inches from row to row.</p>
                  <p>Next let it be observed that the plants to be chosen must not be more than two years old; but most good gardeners prefer those that are only one year from the seed, which are such
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:020722_0042_0FB0E2FEC4DF9AB8"/>
as I would recommend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as from experience I have found they have generally taken root more freely, and succeeded every way better than two year old plants.</p>
                  <p>The following is the method of planting them:</p>
                  <p>Strain your line length-ways the beds, about eight inches from the edge; and then, with a spade, cut out a small trench or drill, close to the line, about six inches deep; making that side next the line nearly upright; and when one trench is opened, plant that, before you open another, at the distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore directed.</p>
                  <p>In placing the roots observe they must not be horizontally extended or put flat in the bottom of the trench, as practised by some people; but they must be laid nearly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, against the back of the trench or drill, so that the crown of the plants may also stand upright, about two to three inches below the surface of the ground: Let them be all placed at an equal depth, spreading their roots a little in nearly a direct position against the back of the trench; and, at the same time, drawing a little earth up against them with the hand, as you place them; just to fix the plants in their due position. When one drill is thus planted, immediately with the rake draw the earth into the drill over the plants; and then open another drill, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:020722_0043_0FB0E30050D2E668"/>
in the same method till the whole is plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Then let the surface of the bed be raked smooth, and cleared from stones, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>At each corner of every bed, let a firm stake be driven into the ground, to serve as a mark for the alleys.</p>
                  <p>It is the custom with some people, who are obliged to make the most of every spot of ground, to sow a thin crop of onions, the first year, on new asparagus beds; and this should be performed before the beds are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; sowing the seeds and raking them light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in. A crop of onions may thus be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, without hurting the asparagus, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the onions are not suffered to grow just about the plants.</p>
                  <p>The asparagus being planted, the next care is, when the plants come up, which will be about the end of this month, or the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the next, to keep them clean from weeds; which must be particularly attended to during the summer season.—[For the further management in dressing up the beds, &amp;c. which must be done this month, see October.]</p>
                  <p>It will be two years, from the time of planting two year old roots, before the aspa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragus will produce handsome buds large enough for use; tho' sometimes a few of the largest are cut the second spring after plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But I do advise to let it be the third
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:020722_0044_0FB0E30641B9BDF0"/>
year before you make a general cutting.</p>
                  <p>A plantation of asparagus, if the beds are properly dressed every year, as directed, in the spring and autumn months, will continue to produce buds for twelve or fourteen years.</p>
                  <p>In making new plantations of asparagus, it is the custom with some gardeners, instead of putting in your plants as before directed, to sow the seed at once in the beds, where the plants are to remain: This is not a bad me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod—for by such practice the roots are not disturbed by a removal, and consequently cannot fail of producing a regular crop. But it must be observed, that if two pieces of ground are to be laid down the same year with asparagus; supposing one piece to be planted with young roots, and the other sown with seed, that piece which was planted will be ready to cut, a year before that sown with seed.</p>
                  <p>However to such as choose to raise a plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of asparagus at once from seed, the method is this:</p>
                  <p>The beds are to be three feet wide, and prepared as before directed for the plants; then mark out two lines lengthways on the beds, and allowing these lines at the distance of sixteen or eighteen inches, dot in a few seeds, covering them about half an inch deep. When the plants have been up some time, you must thin them, leaving only one of the
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:020722_0045_0FB0E307BB886AE0"/>
strongest in each place, and carefully clearing them from weeds—</p>
                  <p>A plantation of asparagus thus raised will produce beds fit to cut the fourth spring after sowing, but they will be very large and fine the fifth year.</p>
                  <p>This is now the season to sow asparagus seed, to raise plants to make new plantations.</p>
                  <p>This seed should be sown about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or middle of this month, on beds of rich earth, about four feet wide, Let it be sown in the broad cast, on the surface; and throw up the alleys about fourteen or sixteen inches wide, and three inches deep; let the seed be buried about half an inch in the earth, and let the ground be raked smooth:—the plants will be up in a month, when they must be kept very clean from weeds, by a careful hand, weeding them at different times in the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
                  <p>If the weather be very dry, when the plants come up, it will be proper to refresh them, now and then, with a little water; which will greatly forward them in their growth.</p>
                  <p>They will be fit to plant out for good next spring, agreeable to the method prescribed.</p>

the autumn to protect them from frost, let the ground be now levelled down, especially if the plants have begun to shoot tolerably strong; observe, as you proceed in levelling down, to dig and loosen all the earth about the plants; and at the same time, examine the number of shoots or suckers proceeding from each stool or root; and selecting two or three of the strongest to remain on every stool or root, you may then readily get to slip the superabundant shoots off clean from the place whence they arise; minding, as above direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to leave two good shoots, but never more than three, upon each root or stock; closing again and gently pressing the earth about the roots, and also about the young plants, with your hands.</p>
                  <p>The shoots that are slipped off will serve to make fresh plantations, where wanted; for artichokes are generally increased by planting the young shoots; and this is the season to do it.</p>
                  <p>When any new plantations of artichokes are intended, let them be planted so soon in this month as you can procure good plants for that purpose; observing that those slips or suckers slipped off, in spring dressing, from the largest plants, as above directed, are the proper sets to be chosen.</p>

<pb n="40" facs="unknown:020722_0047_0FB0E30DE4E80750"/>
but the former is greatly preferable to plant for a general supply, the head being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderably larger, and the eatable parts more thick and fleshy.</p>
                  <p>They should be planted in an open situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in good ground; it may be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary therefore to spread a quantity of good rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten dung over the piece, and to dig it in.—The sets must be planted, with a dib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in rows of five feet asunder, and four feet in the row—give them some water immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after they are planted, to settle the earth about the plants.</p>
                  <p>The above plantation, if kept clear from weeds, and watered now and then in dry wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the beginning of the spring, till they have taken good root, will not fail to yield artichokes in June.</p>
                  <p>You may in the spring, when your arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chokes are dressed, plant a row of drum head cabbage plants between them, or sow radish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, spinage and lettuce; as also, between the rows of your new planted shoots.</p>
                  <p>A plantation of artichokes will continue to produce good heads six or seven years, and sometimes longer; but it must be observed, that such person as desire to have a succession of them for two or three months in the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, should make a new plantation every spring; for the old stocks, which have been planted a year or two, produce heads in May
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:020722_0048_0FB0E311B04D8638"/>
and June; and the slips planted now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce their heads in June and July.</p>
                  <p>About the latter end of this month, sow the seed of artichokes; for this purpose choose a small piece of good ground, in an open situation; throw it up into a bed, about four feet wide; draw four drills thereon, about nine inches from each other, and half an inch deep; plant the seeds about six inches distant in the row; cover the seed over and rake the other ground smooth. The plants from these seeds will be fit to put out, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>Irish potatoes may be planted at any time in this month—these roots thrive best in a moderate, light, loose soil; and where it is not wet, if you add dung it will be of great advantage.</p>
                  <p>For propagating potatoes be careful to procure some good roots; that is, to pick a quantity of the best kind of potatoes, choos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such as are perfectly sound, and of a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable large size: These are to be prepared for planting, by cutting or quartering them; that is to say, each root is to be cut into two<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> three, or more pieces, minding particularly that each piece be furnished with at least one or two good buds, which will be sufficient.

As to the method of planting, it is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently performed with a blunt ended dib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but some plant them as they proceed in digging or plowing the ground, placing them in the trenches or furrows as they go on, and turning the earth from the next trench or furrow over them; and so on to the end.</p>
                  <p>Others dig or plough the ground; then draw drills with a hoe, about two or three inches deep; and so drop the set into the drills and cover them in.</p>
                  <p>But where people plant large quantities, the most expeditious way is to plow them in, by placing the potatoes in the furrows; miss two furrows, and plant one; but you must observe, that your ground must be in good order, clean, and free from weeds, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>Early in this month, sow turnips for a full crop—the best sort to sow now is the early Dutch. But I observe that few people sow turnips at this season; and the reason is, I have heard many say, that they will all go to seed. But the chief cause why they so frequently run to seed is, that it is greatly degenerated, by being sown too often in the same soil; but you will find that when your seed is fresh imported from Europe, not one in ten thousand will run.</p>
                  <p>Let this seed be sown in an open spot of

                  <p>PRUNE, plumb and cherry trees, at any time in this month, if not done before.</p>
                  <p>In pruning plumb and cherry trees, either espaliers or standards; observe, that the same bearers remain many years in a fruitful state.—Let only any causual worn out wood, or any irregular crowded branches, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed parts be cut out, together with all the superfluous and ill placed young shoots of last summer.—</p>
                  <p>But it must be observed, where a supply of young bearing wood is wanting in any part of these trees, that some of the best situated shoots of the last summer's growth must be left in every such place; these shoots are not to be shortened, but each must be left at full length, without being reduced at any future pruning, in summer or winter, where there is room for them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="44" facs="unknown:020722_0051_0FB0E31641D0E7A0"/>
For the shoots, which are now left at full length, and not hereafter shortened, will, in the second or third year after, begin to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce some thick short shoots or spurs, about an inch or more in length; and upon these spurs, and on no other, the fruit of these trees is produced.</p>
                  <p>But on the contrary, if the shoots which are left in to bear were to be shortened, as by many is ignorantly practised, they would not, in that case, produce any such fruit-bearing spurs; but, in the places where the spurs or blossom-buds will otherwise appear, would send out numbers of strong and altogether use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less shoots; with which the trees would be continually crowded; and not one branch would be in a condition to bear, so long as you keep shortening them: and the trees thus mismanaged would not produce one tenth part of the fruit as when treated in the method above mentioned.—</p>
                  <p>Therefore be careful to leave the young shoots as they advance in full length, without reducing them, unless you should perceive any irregular or superabundant ones which may require to be taken out, in which case they should be pruned away close to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther branches.</p>
                  <p>This plainly shows, what method is to be taken, in pruning these trees, to bring them into a condition to bear; it also plainly shows,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:020722_0052_0FB0E3189794E168"/>
that neither the young shoots nor old branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es are, in the general course of pruning, to be shortened.</p>
                  <p>But in the course of pruning the above trees, the branches in general should be well examined with a curious eye; and if there are any which are old or worn out, and not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with good bearing spurs, let such as are decayed, or in an unfruitful state, be taken out, to make room for the more proper bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wood and for a supply of young shoots, in a regular manner.</p>
                  <p>When the old useless wood is cut out, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the remaining branches, &amp;c. And where these stand too close let some of them be cut away, observing to prune out the most unpromising and irregularly grown, and such as can be best spared; and let no two branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es cross each other—and all the summer shoots which are not wanted for a supply of wood, must be now cut away quite close, leaving no spurs but such as are naturally produced.</p>
                  <p>Let the shoots in general be left at equal distances, at the extremities; and always ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to leave the middle of the tree open, to admit a free circulation of air through the branches.</p>

                  <p>The plantations of strawberries should be now cleaned, and have the spring dressing.—First pull or cut off any remaining strings or runners from the plants, and clear the beds from weeds, litter &amp;c. then loosen the ground between the plants, and earth them up: this will strengthen them, and make them flower strongly, and produce large well flavoured fruit.</p>
                  <p>Strawberries may be planted till the middle of this month; but the best season is about the latter end of September, or the beginning of October; for, in such case, they will bear fruit the summer after: indeed those planted now will take root freely; but will not bear any fruit until the next year.—Observing that the proper sets for planting are the young off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets or runners of last summer; such as I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised to be left in May, which must be now procured from these beds of old plants that are in full perfection for bearing, taking them up with good roots, and not disturbing the old stools. Prepare for these plants a piece of good land, if loomy the better, and let some good rotten dung if you can procure it, be dug in. Divide the ground into beds four feet wide, with alleys at least eighteen inch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.

                  <p>Fruit trees, of all sorts, may be planted any time in this month.</p>
                  <p>Let every kind be planted at proper dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances, so that they may have room to grow, without interfering with each other; which, in a few years, is often the case in many gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens and orchards.</p>
                  <p>Peaches and nectarines should never be planted less than twenty-five feet distant from each other; and if you plant them thirty, it would be a more eligible plan; tho' the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance appears considerable at first, yet, if trees are grafted or budded upon free growing stocks, they will readily fill up that place; and bear much better than if confined, so as to require to be often cut back, and kept within bounds.</p>
                  <p>Standard apple and pear trees, when plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in an orchard, should be at least thirty feet distant from each other; and if the land is rich and strong, if they had forty it would be the better.</p>
                  <p>The rule, I advise, to plant standard fruit trees in general is, to allow apple and fruit trees in an orchard, from thirty to forty feet distance, every way; peaches, nectarines and apricots, from twenty-five to thirty feet dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; cherries and plumbs, from eighteen to twenty-five; almonds, quinces and med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, from sixteen to twenty. Observing,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:020722_0056_0FB0E323A9E7AD28"/>
these are the least distances that should be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed; but where there is a good scope of ground, you may allow them five, ten, or even twenty feet more room: for in the end, it will prove to be of greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, when the trees arrive at their full growth.</p>
                  <p>In planting trees of any kind, let care be taken that they are not planted too deep; for that is a more material point than many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple imagine.</p>
                  <p>Open for each tree a hole, wide enough to receive the roots freely, without pressing them against the sides; then, having the trees ready dug up with good spreading roots, which you must take care not to injure in the operation, let the ends of the straggling ones be pruned; and cut off all such as are broken or bruised: then set the tree in the hole, and see that all the roots spread freely as they should do, so as the upper roots be rather over than below the general surface of the ground.—Break the earth well, and throw it in equally about the roots; and in so doing shake the tree gently, that the earth may fall in close between the roots and fibres.</p>
                  <p>When the earth is all in, tread the surface gently, to fix the tree properly; and lastly raise a small concave hill round the tree.</p>
                  <p>Support new planted trees with stakes, as soon as they are planted; that they may not

                  <p>In the first place observe to cut away or grub up all the suckers at the stock of the trees; which otherwise would require much nourishment to support them, and weaken the mother plants; when this is done you must prune out all dead, decayed and crowded wood; and where any large branch grows in a rambling manner across the others, let it be also taken out.</p>
                  <p>Where the branches stand too close, so as not to admit a free circulation of air through the tree, let some of these be also cut away.—The keeping the trees thin, and taking away all irregular and old worn out branches, is the only way to have large and well tasted fruit, and also handsome and lasting trees.</p>
                  <p>The young branches of fig trees must not be shortened, but left at their full length; for by shortening them you will not only cut away the fruit that would have appeared, but also, occasion them to run much to wood, and thereby never to produce half a crop of fruit.</p>

                  <p>Any of the dwarf kind may be now plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but the most profitable are the white, black, and yellow, which are all early kinds, great bearers, and exceeding good for kitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en use.</p>
                  <p>There are three or four other kinds more late, but very great bearers; they are the black speckled, red speckled, large white, and the cream coloured dwarfs. The early and the late sorts may be planted at the same time in this month, and they will succeed each other in bearing.</p>
                  <p>The method of planting them is this.—Dig a square of ground, in an open situation; and if you can give it a moderate dunging, the better.</p>
                  <p>Your ground being dug, rake it even; and take away the stones if any; then with a small hoe draw drills about twenty inches or two feet from each other, and one inch deep; then drop the beans into the bottom of the drills six inches apart; cover them over with your hoe, and rake the ground smooth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="70" facs="unknown:020722_0077_0FB0E35593EFDDD8"/>
Let it be observed, that both the early and late sorts are to be planted in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; only allow the large kinds a little more room from row to row, and likewise in the rows.</p>
                  <p>The white running snap bean is in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est esteem in Europe; where few families use dwarfs after these come in.—They are great bearers, and a fine delicious vegetable if ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered while young. I have known them to thrive exceeding well in this state, and am much surprized to see them taken so little notice of; for they will bear when the dwarfs will not—I have seen them in full bearing in July and August.</p>
                  <p>These beans should be planted in rows about six feet from each other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and from four to six inches in the rows, and in drills about an inch deep, as was before observed.</p>

                  <p>Your early carrots and parsnips will be now advancing fast in their growth, and they should be properly encouraged:—Clear them from weeds, and thin the plants out to their due distances.</p>
                  <p>This work may be either done with the hand or hoe; but those who can use the small hoe will find it to be the most expeditious method of cleaning and thinning the plants: and besides, by loosening the ground with
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:020722_0078_0FB0E357A8E519D8"/>
the hoe, it will in a great manner promote their growth.</p>
                  <p>However, at any rate, let the plants be thined out properly, so that they may have full liberty to grow at the top, and to swell at the bottom. Thin out therefore the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral crops to about seven or eight inches at least, and cut up all the weeds, for there is nothing like allowing these plants plenty of room; by which means, if the ground be good, the roots will become long and strait.</p>
                  <p>The parsnips in particular should be thined out to twelve inches distance; then the roots will swell to a considerable size, and attain their utmost perfection.</p>
                  <p>Such crops of carrots however, as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be drawn for the table when young, need not to be thined at first, to more than four or five inches apart; for, by a gradual thining out the larger, for use, the rest will increase in their growth daily.</p>
                  <p>But the main crops of carrots, that you intend to grow to a full size, should be thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed properly at once; you should in this case allow them full eight or nine inches at least; but if they were placed from ten to twelve inches asunder, it would be the better.</p>

                  <p>About the latter end of this month, sow carrots and parsnips for a general winter crop.</p>

Various are the opinions about sowing these roots for winter use; therefore I think it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on me to let no observation escape that may add to the culture of these valuable vegetables.</p>
                  <p>In England the culture of carrots has ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to such perfection, that for my own cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit I refrain from relating real facts; for I am sure, not one in a thousand would believe me.</p>
                  <p>It seems to be the general opinion of most people, that if they sow their winter crops of carrots before June, they will run all to seed; but those ideas are entirely erroneous; for success depends chiefly on the kind of seed.—If it be the true orange carrot, it will not run;—but if the seed sown in March or April, be of the pale degenerated sort, they will run to seed by September; or, as the gardeners express it, they will all be speared to a plant; while the produce of the true ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine seed imported from Europe, will be in its full vigor. Besides, it is a very hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to get the carrot seed to grow in June, that month often proving dry, and the weather very hot; therefore people who have occasion to sow large crops of carrots for the winter use, should take every precaution to keep the ground as dry as possible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

confine the alleys, but let them be full fifteen inches wide, and not less than six inches deep; by which means you will be able to draw off the water; for if it is suffered to lay on the beds or even in the alleys, the intense heat of the sun in July and August, will scall the roots and rot them.</p>
                  <p>Having laid out the ground into beds, let the surface be raked smooth; then draw four drills on each bed at equal distances, about half an inch deep; and scatter the seeds thin in each drill; cover the seed with your hoe; and rake the ground even standing in the alleys.</p>

                  <p>Now let more than common pains be taken to destroy weeds among crops of every kind, and in every part throughout the garden.</p>
                  <p>There is no work in the kitchen garden that requires more attention than this: for weeds are at no time more dangerous to crops than at the present: it should be therefore the principal care of the gardener to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy them before they grow large; for weeds, when permitted to get to much size, not only exhaust the goodness of the land, and ruin the present crops, but are also a very dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable sight, and require more than double labour to clear the ground of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="90" facs="unknown:020722_0097_0FB0E381C4AA4A48"/>
Let the utmost attention be paid to your small crops that grow pretty close; and let them be timely cleared.</p>
                  <p>That is, let the weeds be cleared away and not suffered to over-spread the plants, which they would soon do when they begin to run, and in this case would do much da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to the crops.</p>
                  <p>Besides, when the weeds are suffered to grow large among the small crops, so as to mix and entangle one with another, and with the plants, it renders the work of hoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or weeding them extremely tedious, and very troublesome to perform.</p>
                  <p>But when weeds appear between the rows of beans, pease, cabbages, and such crops as stand in wide rows, nothing can be more easy than to stop their progress; because, there is room between the plants to admit a large hoe—and with such an instrument a person may go over a large piece of ground in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time; therefore he who would suffer weeds to grow among such crops will be much to blame.</p>

                  <p>THESE trees, in favourable seasons, will set ten times as much fruit as their roots are capable of supplying with proper nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment; and if the whole, or even too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them were to be left, they would starve one another; and the fruit in general would be small and ill flavoured.</p>
                  <p>Besides, where this precaution is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served and too great a quantity of these sorts of fruit remain to ripen on the trees, the ill consequence does not terminate altogether in the badness of the fruit that year, but it
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:020722_0099_0FB0E385A025F330"/>
extends to two or three years to come.—For by suffering the trees to be over burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with fruit, the branches are robbed of their due nourishment; and the trees are so much exhausted that they will not be able to produce shoots capable of bearing fruit the next, and perhaps subsequent year;—and it may probably be the third year before a crop of good fruit can be reasonable expected.</p>
                  <p>Therefore when the fruit is produced too thick upon the trees, and advanced to about the size of a nutmeg, or before; let the quantity be reduced;—and the sooner the work is done the better it is for the trees, and also for the fruit that is to remain on them.</p>
                  <p>This thinning should be performed in a very careful manner, by looking over the branches regularly one by one; and before you take any off, single out, on each shoot, the fruit that is proper to leave, and let the most promising and best shapen remain:—paying a due regard to those that are best situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated on the branches:—each kind according to its size must be left at such proper dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances, that every one may have sufficient room to swell and grow freely to its just big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness every way; and the fruit on the strong shoots should be left at least nine or ten inch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es from each other.—For instance allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a tree is in good condition and strength
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:020722_0100_0FB0E38759609118"/>
for bearing;—and supposing the shoots to be of three different sizes; that is, the strong, the middling, and the weak: the number of fruit to be on those branches are; upon the stronger, three or four of the fairest and best placed; upon the middling shoots two or three, and not more than one on the weak shoots.</p>
                  <p>Was a due regard to be paid to the above distances, and to the number of fruit menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to be left on the different branches; the thinning them nicely in this manner, will be the means of bringing your fruit to the utmost perfection.—At the same time the trees will shoot freely, and produce a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent quantity of good wood to bear fruit the next year.</p>
                  <p>This should be the method of thinning the choice kinds of fruits; but the small and inferior sorts, may be left closer together, and a greater number of fruit may remain upon the different branches:—For instance, the early masculine apricot, the nutmeg peach, and the fair Child's early nectarine are of the earliest kinds, and by far the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest; of these there may be left upon each of the strong shoots, about five fruit; and on the middle size three or four, and so in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion on the weaker shoots.</p>

                  <p>About the beginning of this month, you may look over your peach, nectarine and apricot trees—for they will now require your utmost care and attention.</p>
                  <p>Let these be gone over as quick as possible, while they are making their first shoots, and clear away all the useless ones; and at the same time let the well placed and promising shoots be retained.</p>
                  <p>Likewise let all the luxuriant shoots that generally rise out of the old wood be taken away;—these will neither produce good fruit nor kindly wood, and will also greatly injure the growth of the prime shoots; they are always known by their rambling and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous growth: and as I before observed, in treating of pruning in a former month, branches shooting out from the middle part of the tree should be all displaced, unless any should seem necessary in particular parts, to fill up a vacancy, or to furnish a supply of wood—but only some occasional shoots of these kinds should be left, and let all the others be cleared away quite close.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding, be careful to leave a full sufficiency of the best shoots, that are of a kind and moderate growth; that is, the shoots that are produced this summer, to bear fruit next year; therefore it is much the
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:020722_0102_0FB0E38AA5AF6278"/>
best way to reserve at this season a sufficient quantity of kindly growing shoots, that there may be enough to choose from in winter pruning.</p>
                  <p>Observe not to shorten any of the shoots thus left at this season; but let them remain at full length<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for by topping them, they will produce so many young shoots, as would crowd the fruit too much.</p>
                  <p>In the early summer dressing or pruning of these kinds of trees, it is also requisite to keep the middle part open to admit a free circulation of air among the branches; which will be very beneficial to the fruit; but, at the same time, not to cut away too much, so as to leave the fruit altogether exposed to the sun.</p>
                  <p>The displacing of these young shoots at this season may be carefully performed with the finger and thumb; and the fruit may be thinned at the same time as before directed.</p>

both in giving an opportunity of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the work with more expedition and regularity, and in affording a greater benefit to the trees and fruit.—Observe that all the immediate bearing shoots, which now discover the young bunches of grapes upon them, must be left,—and such other shoots as have strength, and are well situated for the purpose of throwing out bearers next year, must be left in the places where they are wanted; but all weak and straggling shoots, such particularly as often arise im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from the old wood are useless, and must be cleared away, where-ever they are produced; except in such places where young wood is absolutely needful;—and even strong shoots that are destitute of fruit, and arise in places where they are not evidently wanted, should also be taken off.</p>
                  <p>When this is done, let all the bearing shoots, and all others that are necessary, be left in their proper places, in regular order—and do not stop any of the shoots now, but let each be left at full length for the present, so that all the branches, and fruit, may equally enjoy the advantages of sun and air.</p>
                  <p>After this dressing, observe, that all shoots that put out in any part of the vines, must be constantly rubbed off as soon as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and no small shoots must be suffered to remain, unless it be to fill a vacancy.</p>

                  <p>It would be very proper, in dry weather, to steep the beans in soft water about six or
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:020722_0106_0FB0EE3082B8FDB0"/>
eight hours before they are planted.—They will spring and take root much sooner and stronger.</p>
                  <p>You may also plant in this month the white runners; they will stand the heat bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the dwarfs, and bear more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.—You must give them proper sticks for them to run up.</p>

                  <p>Your cabbage plants, that were sown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the middle of April, will be fit to plant out early in this month, to the places where they are to cabbage.</p>
                  <p>For these plants prepare a piece of good ground, in the most open situation of your garden:—Dung it well with good rotten dung, if you can procure it; and dig it in evenly, laying the surface smooth; then mark out the ground for the plants, in rows about two feet or two feet and a half; and if your plants be of a very large kind, you may even allow them three feet from row to row, and two feet and a half from each other in the rows:—Observe that the distance for planting cabbage plants depends entirely on the goodness of the land.—The surface of
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:020722_0107_0FB0EE320F4944E0"/>
the ground being laid even, and your rows all marked out, draw the earth up into small ridges or beds about six or seven inches high; and let the top of them be flat, observing at the same time to let these small beds or ridges range with the descent of the ground, if there be any; for if the water is suffered to lie in the alleys next month, when the heavy rains set in, the roots of the plants will be scalded; this is a very material cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance which you ought to guard against.</p>
                  <p>It is very necessary also to observe, that the plants, at this season, should be planted out as soon after a shower of rain as possible; and if the weather should prove dry, give them now and then a little water every even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, till they have taken good root;—and should the day after planting prove very hot, which often happens in this month, it would be of great advantage to the plants to stick a small bush on the south side of them; which would not only protect the plants from the violence of the sun, but greatly promote their taking root.</p>
                  <p>You may still continue to sow cabbages and savoys, for winter use.</p>

                  <p>Let these shoots be taken away quite close to the place from whence they are produced, except such as grow out close to the fruit; which may be cut off within half an inch of the branch.—Observe to leave, in every part of these trees, a sufficient quantity of the best shoots, for the purpose of bearing fruit the next year;—leave also a plenty of the more regular and moderate shoots that are well situated; observing at the same time to keep<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the middle of the tree as open as possible, to admit air among the branches.—Do not shorten any of the shoots you intend to leave, for the reason mentioned last month; but let them stand at full length, both the large and smaller ones; and take particular care to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>In ordering these trees, it must be observed, that there is no need to leave a general sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of young wood, as in peaches, nectarines, &amp;c. which bear their fruit always upon one year old shoots, and in consequence thereof, require a peculiar treatment.—But as the case is otherwise with the trees I am now speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, there is no necessity to leave, every summer, a general supply of young shoots in every part of the tree; for as to apples, pears, plumbs and cherries, their branches seldom begin to bear till they are two or three, and sometimes four or five years old; the branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of plumbs and cherries generally begin to bear at one and two years, likewise apples sometimes in the lower parts of these States: while the pears oftener bear from four to five year old spurs:—and when the branches of all these kinds have arrived to a fruitful state, the same bearers continue to produce fruit in more and greater abundance for many years: so that there is no necessity, after the trees are once furnished fully with bearing branches, to leave such<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a general and constant supply of young shoots above mentioned, as would be required on different trees which produce their fruit on shoots of the preceding sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's

growth.—But notwithstanding it will be proper to leave here and there, in every tree, some of the best grown and well placed side shoots, together with the leader, to each branch, if there be sufficient room: this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution should not on any account be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; for some of those summer shoots will most probably be wanted, to lay in, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply some vacant place or other of the tree, in the winter pruning.</p>
                  <p>But where there appears to be an absolute want of wood in any part of these trees, do not fail, in that case, to leave, if possible, some good shoots in such vacant parts.</p>
                  <p>It is always the best method to leave the trees pretty full of proper shoots, at this season; they will be ready, in case they should be wanted, to fill up any vacancy, or to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the place of old useless dead or worn out wood, when you come to prune in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and such shoots as are not wanted may then be cut away.</p>

                  <p>For this crop you should choose one of the best pieces of land your garden affords; and to have fine cauliflowers and brocoli you must give it a dressing with good rotten dung—and let it be spread even over the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face; dig it in, and lay the ground smooth; then mark out the rows about two feet and a half for the cauliflowers, and three feet for the brocoli; plant the former at two feet in the rows, and the latter two feet and a half: the ground being dug in a proper manner, draw the earth up into small beds or ridges, as before directed under the head of cabbages; and, if the weather should prove dry after planting, give them a moderate watering every evening, till they have taken good root; and if you were to stick a small bush on the south side of each plant the next morning after they are put out, (the evening being now the best time for planting) it would be of great ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to them, by screening them from the intense heat of the sun.</p>
                  <p>You may still sow more cauliflower and brocoli seed, if you have not got a sufficiency of plants from your former sowings; they may be sown on a bed, as directed in last

month; and should now have a temporary shade erected over them, which will not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly break the violent heat of the sun, but also the heavy showers of rain which commonly fall, and cripple the young plants at this season.</p>
                  <p>If the weather should prove dry, after the sowing of the above seed, give them a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate watering every evening till they come up, and every two or three days after they are up; for the plants at this time ought to be forwarded as much as possible in their growth, as the season for sowing them is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most spent.</p>

                  <p>You may, about the middle of this month, prepare some trenches, to plant out your first crop of celery.</p>
                  <p>For this purpose choose a spot of rich ground, and clear it well from weeds; then mark out the trenches about a foot broad, and allow three or four feet between the trenches; dig each out at this season about six inches deep, without shoveling the crumbs out at the bottom; place the earth that comes out neatly in the spaces between the trenches; observe to lay it equally, and spread it as even as possible;—then put in the bottom of each trench some good rotten dung, and dig it in.</p>

                  <p>And besides retarding the growth, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basing the taste of the fruit, it is also detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in a very great degree, to both stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard and espalier trees, to neglect summer pruning until this time; and in particular peach, nectarine, and apricots, and such like trees as produce their fruit principally upon one year old shoots.</p>
                  <p>Besides, it causes great perplexity to the operator, to break through and regulate such a confusion of young shoots;—it also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires treble pains and labour, and cannot be executed with half the accuracy as when the work is commenced early in the summer.</p>
                  <p>There is a very great advantage in begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning early in the summer to prune, train and leave the useful shoots in their proper places; and at the same time to clear the trees from all that are ill-placed and luxuriant:—For when the useless ones are timely cut away, and the useful left in a regular manner all the summer, the sun, air and gentle showers will have a proper access, not only to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the growth and improve the flavour of the fruit, but also to harden and ripen the shoots perfectly, which is absolutely necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their producing good fruit the next year.</p>

               <p>The above mentioned sorts are well calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated for town gardens: for you may plant three of these to one of the larger kind of cabbages: neither will they be half so long on the ground.</p>

                  <p>You may either plant them in beds on the quarter of your garden, or in the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of each side of the principal walk;—but let them be planted where they will (if you

                  <p>Choose for these plants the lowest part of your garden; for they delight in low moist land; observe, never to suffer the water to lay on or between the beds, either in sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer or winter,—If you would wish to have large, and good flavoured fruit, it would be proper to give your ground a good dressing with manure when you put out the plants.</p>

It would be very imprudent to destroy the old beds the same year you make your new ones; as they will bear but little for the first and second season: tho' the third year they will come into full bearing, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce fruit plentifully:—Therefore, as I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served above, take out only such young plants as can be best spared, and will not injure your crop, for the ensuing year.—You will find many young plants round the outside of the old beds, which (if not taken up to make new plantations) must be destroyed—let it be observed that the old plants which bore fruit the last year, are not proper to be planted out; for they will not produce fruit more than one season, when they die, and are succeeded by young shoots every sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:—It is these and these only, that I mean should be planted out to form new beds.</p>
                  <p>Having procured a sufficient number of young plants, trim off the ends of the strag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling roots, and one-third part of the young shoots, and plant them in rows four or five feet one from another; and about a foot or fifteen inches from each other.</p>
                  <p>Let the old raspberry beds be examined, and let all the old branches be taken out, and the young shoots properly arranged, and the weeds which are now on the beds be taken away, and the earth loosened between the

young plants that are left—lay in some good rotten dung betwixt them, and let the alleys be now dug a full spade deep, and three feet wide, close up to the plants; and as you are digging between the rows, cast a little earth over the dung: by so doing the raspberry beds will look neat all the winter, and will be in a fair way of producing a good crop of fruit next season.</p>

                  <p>NEAR the middle, or the latter end of this month, you may plant some beans to come early the succeeding spring.</p>
                  <p>Those which are planted now, if they survive the winter's frost, &amp;c. will be fit for use early in April.</p>
                  <p>The Mazagon bean is the best to plant at this season; for they will come up earlier then any other sort, and are excellent bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers tho' but of an humble growth; and they will stand the winter better then the larger kinds.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="158" facs="unknown:020722_0165_0FB0EE9D46BFF378"/>
A warm border under a south wall, is the best situation to plant those beans at this season.</p>
                  <p>They should be planted in rows across the border—that is, provided the border is five or six feet wide; observing that the rows are to be two feet asunder, which will be room enough for this sort.—The beans should be planted four or five inches from each other in the rows, and near an inch and a half deep.</p>
                  <p>You may also plant one row lengthways of the border, within two or three inches of the wall or fence: these will sometimes out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live the winter, when those at a greater dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the wall, &amp;c. are destroyed.</p>
                  <p>But, if the border is narrow, you had better plant two rows only lengthways; that is, one row near the wall, and the other about two feet and a half from it.</p>
                  <p>They may be planted wither with a blunt dibble putting them in about an inch and a half, or near two inches deep; or you may draw drills that depth, and drop the beans therein; drawing the earth an equal depth over them, and rake the ground smooth.</p>
                  <p>In planting early beans, it often proves successful first to sow them pretty thick in a bed of rich earth; and when they come up a little height, transplant them into the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="159" facs="unknown:020722_0166_0FB0EE9ED89503B8"/>
The method is this:—Dig a bed about three or four feet broad, of good earth, in a warm corner of your garden.</p>
                  <p>The ground being dug, draw the earth off about an inch and an half or near two inches in depth equally from the surface, half to the one side and half to the other.—This done, scatter the beans thereon about an inch asunder, and immediately cover them over with the earth that was drawn off for that purpose: or you may with your hoe draw broad flat drills cross-way the bed, and scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the beans pretty thick, and cover them over with earth equally; and if severe frost should prevail in their infant slate while re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining altogether in this, they can readily be protected with a few pine tops till they are fit to transplant.</p>
                  <p>When the beans are come up an inch and a half or two inches high, they should then in mild weather, be transplanted into the above mentioned borders, taking them care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully out of the seed-bed with their full spreading roots, and as much earth as will hang about them—pull the old beans at the bottom, and trim the end of the perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar root, and then plant them in rows in the same manner and at the same distance as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore directed; observing to close the earth well about every plant—they will soon take root and grow freely.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="160" facs="unknown:020722_0167_0FB0EEA070EF67A0"/>
One reason for this practice is, the best of gardeners allow, that the beans which are transplanted, will come in sooner by a week or ten days than those that are not, though the seed be put in the ground the same day.</p>

                  <p>The early hotspurs are the proper sorts to sow at this time.—Choose seeds that are fresh and new.</p>
                  <p>There are several sorts of the hotspurs, such as the golden, Carleton, Reading, &amp;c. These I would recommend to sow for the first crop.</p>
                  <p>A warm south border, under a wall or fence, is the most proper place to sow them in at this season—the seed must be sown in drills, either lengthways or in rows, athwart the border, according to its breadth: where it is but narrow, draw one drill only length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways at the distance of one or two feet from the wall or fence, and scatter the pease there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in pretty thick, but as regular as possible—cover them up immediately with cath about an inch and a half deep, and rake the ground even.</p>
                  <p>Where your border is five or six feet wide, it would be proper to sew the peae in drills cross-ways

                  <p>The young vines which were planted out in the last season, should be now looked over; as they will probably have produced some (more or less) young shoots, the last summer.</p>
                  <p>These shoots should be all shortened with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in three eyes of the old wood, in order to make them put out with more vigour the next year.</p>

                  <head>PRUNING VINES THE SECOND YEAR AFTER PLANTING.</head>
                  <p>As these vines were headed down very short the first year after planting, it is to be supposed that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> some of them have made three, four, and perhaps six fine and strong kindly shoots, eight or ten feet long.—These shoots, some over-wise people will lay in. six or eight feet the second year—but such practice I by no means approve of: for the running them out so long before the plants are well established in the ground, will weaken them so much, that with all the art you are possessed of, it will be three or four years before your young vines will have acquired sufficient strength to produce good wood, without which there will be no pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:020722_0186_0FB0EDA07660CAA8"/>
of fine fruit; therefore let the shoots be shortened the second year also, to within four or five eyes of the last year's wood; and the third season they will with proper care cover an arbor eight feet wide and ten feet high, with fine fruit-bearing shoots.—By this treatment your vines will acquire pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per strength, and may, probably produce some fine fruit the next summer.</p>

                  <p>By this time your vines will have acquired strength, if managed as before directed; and may have produced on each plant from eight to twelve fine bearing shoots, which should be also shortened according to their strength, leaving the strongest of them after pruned, at least five feet; and if very strong, six feet will not be too much.</p>
                  <p>Then let them be tied to the frame ten inches or a foot from each other:—Tho' this distance may seem great at this season, you will find your arbor compleatly shaded in the summer.—For the further manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of these, I refer you to the next head on pruning old vines.</p>

In the first place let all the last summer's shoots which have sprung out of the old wood and branches be cut away; except in such particular places where they are abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely wanted in the ensuing year: in such a case only they are to remain; but let them be shortened with two or three good eyes from the old wood.—By cutting the shoots so short it will be the means of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing strong and kindly ones, which may probably prove fruitful the summer after next.</p>
                  <p>Observe in the next place, that all the short shoots which were suffered to remain in the last spring (for the purpose of bearing fruit only) should be now examined; and the most weakly and ill-placed of them be cut away; leaving the prosperous and most healthy shoots about ten or twelve inches from each other; and shortened so as not to have more than one or two good eyes (or as the gardener's call them spurs) to your vines; which will produce good fruit in the next season.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly and lastly, let all the shoots which were laid in the last summer, be carefully looked over; and all the side shoots from the principal bearing young branches be cut away quite close from whence they proceed; as they will neither bear good fruit, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce good wood, being always of a rambling

and irregular growth.—This being done, shorten the shoots which are left, agreeable to the state and strength of each, as in the following manner.</p>
                  <p>Your young shoots will now require great attention, and must be shortened according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:—The most weakly should be cut back within three or four eyes of the old wood, in order to render them strong and healthy by the ensuing summer;—those of a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling strength should be taken off within five or six eyes, whilst those that are strong and luxuriant may be (where there is sufficient room) permitted to remain with eight or twelve, and even from twelve to sixteen eyes; tho' let it be observed, that this treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is only intended for old grown grape vines.</p>

                  <p>Choose for this purpose some good young plants of one and not more than two years old.—If you put them out for an arbor (which is the most approved method) let holes be dug where you intend your plants to grow, about three feet wide and eighteen inches deep—put therein a barrow full of rich earth mixed with some good rotten dung, planting the young vines near the frame about five or six feet from each other,
