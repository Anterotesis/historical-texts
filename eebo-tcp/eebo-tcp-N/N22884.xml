            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </opener>
               <p>IN recurring to the internal ſituation of our country ſince I had laſt the pleaſure to addreſs you, I find ample reaſon for a renewed expreſſion of that gratitude to the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:030227_0005_0FE54BB4A4062718"/>
Ruler of the Univerſe, which a continued ſeries of proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity has ſo often and ſo juſtly called forth.</p>
               <p>The acts of the laſt ſeſſion, which required ſpecial ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangements, have been, as far as circumſtances would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, carried into operation.</p>
               <p>Meaſures calculated to enſure a continuance of the friendſhip of the Indians, and to preſerve peace along the extent of our interior frontier, have been digeſted and adopted. In the framing of theſe, care has been taken to guard on the one hand, our advanced ſettlements from the predatory incurſions of thoſe unruly individuals, who cannot be reſtrained by their tribes; and on the other hand, to protect the rights ſecured to the Indians by trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; to draw them nearer to the civilized ſtate; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire them with correct conceptions of the power, as well as juſtice of the government.</p>
               <p>The meeting of the deputies from the Creek nation at Coleraine, in the State of Georgia, which had for a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal object the purchaſe of a parcel of their land by that State, broke up without its being accompliſhed; the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion having, previous to their departure, inſtructed them againſt making any ſale; the occaſion however has been improved, to confirm by a new treaty with the Creeks, their pre-exiſting engagements with the United States; and to obtain their conſent to the eſtabliſhment of trading houſes, and military poſts within their boundary; by means of which their friendſhip and the general peace may be more effectually ſecured.</p>
               <p>The period during the late ſeſſion, at which the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation was paſſed, for carrying into effect the Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation, between the United States and his Britannic Majeſty, neceſſarily procraſtinated the reception of the poſts ſtipulated to be delivered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the date aſſigned for that event.</p>
               <p>As ſoon however as the Governor General of Canada could be addreſſed with propriety on the ſubject, arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were cordially and promptly concluded for their
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:030227_0006_0FE54BB631A6B950"/>
evacuation, and the United States took poſſeſſion of the principal of them, comprehending Oſwego, Niagara, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troit, Michilimackinac and Fort Miami, where ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs and additions have been ordered to be made as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared indiſpenſable.</p>
               <p>The commiſſioners appointed on the part of the United States and of Great Britain, to determine which is the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver St. Croix, mentioned in the treaty of peace of 1783, agreed in the choice of Egbert Benſon, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of New-York, for the third commiſſioner. The whole met at St. Andrew's, in Paſſamaquody Bay, in the beginning of Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober, and directed ſurveys to be made of the rivers in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; but deeming it impracticable to have theſe ſurveys completed before the next year, they adjourned, to meet at Boſton in Auguſt 1797, for the final deciſion of the queſtion.</p>
               <p>Other commiſſioners appointed on the part of the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States, agreeably to the ſeventh article of the treaty with Great-Britain, relative to captures and condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of veſſels and other property, met the commiſſioners of his Britannic majeſty in London, in Auguſt laſt, when John Trumbull, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> was choſen by lot, for the fifth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner. In October following, the board were to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to buſineſs. As yet, there has been no communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of commiſſioners on the part of Great-Britain, to unite with thoſe who have been appointed on the part of the United States, for carrying into effect the ſixth article of the treaty.</p>
               <p>The treaty with Spain required that the commiſſioners for running the boundary line between the territory of the United States, and his Catholic Majeſty's provinces of Eaſt and Weſt Florida, ſhould meet at the Natchez before the expiration of ſixth months after the exchange of the rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, which was effected at Aranjuez on the twenty-fifth day of April; and the troops of his Catholic Majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, occupying any poſts within the limits of the United States, were within the ſame period to be withdrawn.— The commiſſioner of the United States, therefore, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced his journey for the Natchez in September, and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:030227_0007_0FE54BBA09D891A0"/>
troops were ordered to occupy the poſts from which the Spaniſh garriſons ſhould be withdrawn. Information has been recently received of the appointment of a commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner on the part of his Catholic Majeſty, for running the boundary line; but none of any appointment for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtment of the claims of our citizens, whoſe veſſels were captured by the armed veſſels of Spain.</p>
               <p>In purſuance of the act of Congreſs paſſed in the laſt ſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, for the protection and relief of American ſeamen, agents were appointed, one to reſide in Great Britain, and the other in the Weſt-Indies. The effects of the agency in the Weſt-Indies are not yet fully aſcertained; but thoſe which have been communicated afford grounds to believe the meaſure will be beneficial. The agent deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tined to reſide in Great-Britain declining to accept the appointment, the buſineſs has conſequently devolved on the miniſter of the United States, in London, and will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his attention, until a new agent ſhall be appointed.</p>
               <p>After many delays and diſappointments ariſing out of the European war, the final arrangements for fulfilling the engagements made to the Dey and Regency of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers, will, in all preſent appearance, be crowned with ſucceſs; but under great, though inevitable diſadvantages in the pecuniary tranſactions, occaſioned by that war<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which will render a further proviſion neceſſary. The actual liberation of all our citizens who were priſoners in Algiers, while it gratifies every feeling heart, is itſelf an earneſt of a ſatisfactory termination of the whole ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociation. Meaſures are in operation for effecting trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with the Regencies of Tunis and Tripoli.</p>
               <p>To an active external commerce, the protection of a naval force is indiſpenſable. This is manifeſt with regard to wars in which a ſtate is itſelf a party. But beſides this, it is in our own experience, that the moſt ſincere neutrality is not a ſufficient guard againſt the depredations of nations at war. To ſecure reſpect to a neutral flag, requires a naval force, organized and ready to vindicate it from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult or aggreſſion. This may even prevent the neceſſity of going to war, by diſcouraging belligerent powers from
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:030227_0008_0FE54BBCD7479458"/>
committing ſuch violations of the rights of the neutral party, as may, firſt or laſt, leave no other option. From the beſt information I have been able to obtain, it would ſeem as if our trade to the Mediterranean, without a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting force, will always be inſecure; and our citizens expoſed to the calamities from which numbers of them have but juſt been relieved.</p>
               <p>Theſe conſiderations invite the United States to look to the means, and to ſet about the gradual creation of a navy. The increaſing progreſs of their navigation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes them, at no diſtant period, the requiſite ſupply of ſeamen; and their means, in other reſpects, favour the undertaking. It is an encouragement likewiſe, that their particular ſituation will give weight and influence to a moderate naval force in their hands. Will it not then be adviſable to begin without delay to provide and lay up the materials for the building and equipping of ſhips of war; and to proceed in the work by degrees, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as our reſources ſhall render it practicable without inconvenience; ſo that a future war of Europe may not find our commerce in the ſame unprotected ſtate in which it was found by the preſent?</p>
               <p>Congreſs have repeatedly, and not without ſucceſs, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected their attention to the encouragement of manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. The object is of too much conſequence not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure a continuance of their efforts in every way which ſhall appear eligible. As a general rule, manufactures on public account are inexpedient. But where the ſtate of things in a country leaves little hope that certain branches of manufacture will for a great length of time obtain; when theſe are of a nature eſſential to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing and equipping of the public force in time of war; are not eſtabliſhments for procuring them on public ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, <hi>to the extent of the ordinary demand for the public ſervice,</hi> recommended by ſtrong conſiderations of national policy, as an exception to the general rule? Ought our country to remain in ſuch caſes dependent on foreign ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, precarious, becauſe liable to be interrupted?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="unknown:030227_0009_0FE54BBE65450FB8"/>If the neceſſary articles ſhould in this mode coſt more in time of peace, will not the ſecurity and independence thence ariſing, form an ample compenſation? Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this ſort, commenſurate only with the calls of the public ſervice in time of peace, will, in time of war<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eaſily be extended in proportion to the exigencies of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and may even perhaps be made to yield a ſurplus for the ſupply of our citizens at large, ſo as to mitigate the privations from the interruptions of their trade. If adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the plan ought to exclude all thoſe branches which are already, or likely ſoon to be eſtabliſhed in the country; in order that there may be no danger of interference with purſuits of individual induſtry.</p>
               <p>It will not be doubted, that with reference either to individual or national welfare, agriculture is of primary importance. In proportion as nations advance in popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and other circumſtances of maturity, this truth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more apparent; and renders the cultivation of the ſoil more and more an object of public patronage. Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for promoting it, grow up ſupported by the public purſe: and to what object can it be dedicated with greater propriety? Among the means which have been employed to this end, none have been attended with greater ſucceſs, than the eſtabliſhment of Boards, compoſed of proper cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, charged with collecting and diffuſing information, and enabled, by premiums and ſmall pecuniary aids, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage and aſſiſt a ſpirit of diſcovery and improvement.— This ſpecies of eſtabliſhment contributes doubly to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of improvement; by ſtimulating to enterprize and experiment; and by drawing to a common centre the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults every where of individual ſkill and obſervation, and ſpreading them thence over the whole nation. Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence accordingly has ſhewn, that they are very cheap in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of immenſe national benefits.</p>
               <p>I have heretofore propoſed to the conſideration of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, the expediency of eſtabliſhing a National Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and alſo a Military Academy. The deſirableneſs of both theſe inſtitutions, has ſo conſtantly increaſed with every new view I have taken of the ſubject, that I cannot
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:030227_0010_0FE54BC08964A9C0"/>
omit the opportunity of once for all, recalling your atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them.</p>
               <p>The aſſembly to which I addreſs myſelf, is too enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened not to be fully ſenſible how much a flouriſhing ſtate of the arts and ſciences contributes to national proſperity and reputation. True it is, that our country, much to its honor, contains many ſeminaries of learning highly reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and uſeful; but the funds upon which they reſt, are too narrow to command the ableſt profeſſors in the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent departments of liberal knowledge, for the inſtitution contemplated: though they would be excellent auxiliaries.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the motives to ſuch an inſtitution, the aſſimila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the principles, opinions and manners of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, by the common education of a portion of our youth from every quarter, well deſerves attention. The more homogeneous our citizens can be made in theſe particulars, the greater will be our proſpect of permanent union; and a primary object of ſuch a national inſtitution ſhould be, the education of our youth in the ſcience of <hi>government.</hi> In a republic, what ſpecies of knowledge can be equally important? And what duty more preſſing on its legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, than to patroniſe a plan for communicating it to thoſe who are to be the future guardians of the liberties of the country?</p>
               <p>The inſtitution of a military academy, is alſo recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by cogent reaſons. However pacific the general policy of a nation may be, it ought never to be without an adequate ſtock of military knowledge for emergencies. The firſt would impair the energy of its character, and both would hazard its ſafety, or expoſe it to greater evils when war could not be avoided. Beſides, that war might often not depend upon its own choice. In proportion as the obſervance of pacific maxims might exempt a nation from the neceſſity of practiſing the rules of the military art, ought to be its care in preſerving and tranſmitting by proper eſtabliſhments, the knowledge of that art. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever argument may be drawn from particular examples, ſuperficially viewed, a thorough examination of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject will evince, that the art of war is at once comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:030227_0011_0FE54BC648FCE358"/>
and complicated; that it demands much previous ſtudy; and that the poſſeſſion of it, in its moſt improved and perfect ſtate, is always of great moment to the ſecurity of a nation. This, therefore, ought to be a ſerious care of every government; and for this purpoſe, an academy, where a regular courſe of inſtruction is given, is an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious expedient, which different nations have ſucceſsfully employed.</p>
               <p>The compenſations to the officers of the United States, in various inſtances, and in none more than in reſpect to the moſt important ſtations, appear to call for legiſlative reviſion. The conſequences of a defective proviſion are of ſerious import to the government. If private wealth is to ſupply the defect of public retribution, it will greatly contract the ſphere within which the ſelection of character for office is to be made; and will proportionally diminiſh the probability of a choice of men, able as well as upright. Beſides that it would be repugnant to the vital principles of our government, virtually to exclude from public truſts, talents and virtue, unleſs accompanied by wealth.</p>
               <p>While in our external relations, ſome ſerious inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies and embarraſſments have been overcome, and others leſſened, it is with much pain, and deep regret, I mention, that circumſtances of a very unwelcome nature have lately occurred. Our trade has ſuffered, and is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering extenſive injuries in the Weſt-Indies, from the cruizers and agents of the French republic; and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations have been received from its miniſter here, which indicate the danger of a further diſturbance of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce by its authority; and which are, in other reſpects, far from agreeable.</p>
               <p>It has been my conſtant, ſincere and earneſt wiſh, in conformity with that of our nation, to maintain cordial harmony, and a perfectly friendly underſtanding with that republic. This wiſh remains unabated; and I ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in the endeavour to fulfil it, to the utmoſt extent of what ſhall be conſiſtent with a juſt, and indiſpenſable regard to the rights and honour of our country: nor will I eaſily ceaſe to cheriſh the expectation, that a ſpirit of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:030227_0012_0FE54BC7D7649620"/>
candor and friendſhip, on the part of the republic, will eventually enſure ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>In purſuing this courſe, however, I cannot forget what is due to the character of our government and nation; or to a full and entire confidence in the good ſenſe, patriotiſm, ſelf-reſpect and fortitude of my countrymen.</p>
               <p>I reſerve for a ſpecial meſſage, a more particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication on this intereſting ſubject.</p>

               <p>It is with ſatisfaction I am able to inform you, that the revenues of the United States continue in a ſtate of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſive improvement.</p>
               <p>A reinforcement of the exiſting proviſions for diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our public debt, was mentioned in my addreſs at the opening of the laſt ſeſſion. Some preliminary ſteps were taken towards it, the maturing of which will, no doubt, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage your zealous attention during the preſent.

               <p>My ſolicitude to ſee the militia of the United States placed on an efficient eſtabliſhment, has been ſo often, and ſo ardently expreſſed, that I ſhall but barely recall the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to your view on the preſent occaſion; at the ſame time that I ſhall ſubmit to your inquiry, whether our har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours are yet ſufficiently ſecured.</p>

               <head type="sub">The Senate preſented to the Preſident the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing anſwer to his addreſs of the 7th.</head>
               <p>WE thank you, Sir, for your faithful and detailed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure of the exiſting ſituation of our country: and we ſincerely join in ſentiments of gratitude to an over-ruling Providence, for the diſtinguiſhed ſhare of public proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and private happineſs, which the people of the United States ſo peculiarly enjoy.</p>
               <p>We are fully ſenſible of the advantages that have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted from the adoption of meaſures (which you have ſucceſsfully carried into effect) to preſerve peace, cultivate friendſhip, and promote civilization, among the Indian tribes, on the weſtern frontiers;—feelings of humanity, and the moſt ſolid political principles, equally encourage the continuance of this ſyſtem.</p>
               <p>We obſerve with pleaſure, that the delivery of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary poſts, lately occupied by the Britiſh forces, within the territory of the United States, was made with cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, and promptitude, as ſoon as circumſtances would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; and that the other proviſions of our treaties with Great-Britain and Spain, that were objects of eventual
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030227_0014_0FE54BCB876F2708"/>
arrangement, are about being carried into effect, with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire harmony and good faith.</p>
               <p>The unfortunate, but unavoidable difficulties that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed a timely compliance with the terms of the Algerine treaty, are much to be lamented; as they may occaſion a temporary ſuſpenſion of the advantages to be derived from a ſolid peace with that power, and a perfect ſecurity from its predatory warfare; at the ſame time, the lively impreſſions that affected the public mind, on the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our captive fellow-citizens, afford the moſt laudable incentive to our exertions, to remove the remaining obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</p>
               <p>We perfectly coincide with you in opinion that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of our commerce demands a naval force for its protection againſt foreign inſult and depredation, and our ſolicitude to attain that object will be always proportionate to its magnitude.</p>
               <p>The neceſſity of accelerating the eſtabliſhment of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain uſeful manufactures, by the intervention of legiſlative aid and protection, and the encouragement due to agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by the creation of Boards, (compoſed of intelligent individuals) to patronize this primary purſuit of ſociety, are ſubjects which will readily engage our moſt ſerious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
               <p>A national univerſity may be converted to the moſt uſeful purpoſes—the ſcience of legiſlation, being ſo eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally dependent on the endowments of the mind, the public intereſt muſt receive effectual aid from the general diffuſion of knowledge; and the United States will aſſune a more dignified ſtation, among the nations of the earth, by the ſucceſsful cultivation of the higher branches of literature.</p>
               <p>A military academy may be likewiſe rendered equally important. To aid and direct the phyſical force of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by cheriſhhing a military ſpirit, enforcing a proper ſenſe of diſcipline, and inculcating a ſcientific ſyſtem of tactics, is conſonant to the ſoundeſt maxims of public poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: connected with, and ſupported by ſuch an eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:030227_0015_0FE54BD1C82AD5E8"/>
a well regulated militia, conſtituting the national defence of the country, would prove the moſt effectual, as well as economical, preſervative of peace.</p>
               <p>We cannot but conſider, with ſerious apprehenſions, the inadequate compenſations of public officers, eſpecially of thoſe in the more important ſtations. It is not only a violation of the ſpirit of a public contract, but is an evil ſo extenſive in its operation, and ſo deſtructive in its conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, that we truſt it will receive the moſt pointed le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative attention.</p>
               <p>We ſincerely lament, that whilſt the conduct of the United States has been uniformly impreſſed with the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of equity, moderation, and love of peace, in the maintainance of all their foreign relationſhips, our trade ſhould be ſo harraſſed by the cruiſers and agents of the republic of France, throughout the extenſive departments of the Weſt-Indies.</p>
               <p>Whilſt we are confident that no cauſe of complaint ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, that could authoriſe an interruption of our tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or diſengage that republic from the bonds of amity, cemented by the faith of treaties, we cannot but expreſs our deepeſt regrets, that official communications have been made to you, indicating a more ſerious diſturbance of our commerce. Although we cheriſh the expectation, that a ſenſe of juſtice, and a conſideration of our mutual inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts will moderate their councils; we are not unmindful of the ſituation in which events may place us, nor unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to adopt that ſyſtem of conduct, which, compatible with the dignity of a reſpectable nation, neceſſity may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel us to purſue.</p>
               <p>We cordially acquieſce in the reflection, that the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States, under the operation of the federal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, have experienced a moſt rapid aggrandizement and proſperity, as well political, as commercial.</p>
               <p>Whilſt contemplating the cauſes that produce this auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious reſult, we much acknowledge the excellence of the conſtitutional ſyſtem, and the wiſdom of the legiſlative
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:030227_0016_0FE54BD390249D38"/>
proviſions;—but we ſhould be deficient in gratitude and juſtice, did we not attribute a great portion of theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, to the virtue, firmneſs and talents of your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration; which have been conſpicuouſly diſplayed in the moſt trying times, and on the moſt critical occaſions. It is, therefore, with the ſincereſt regret, that we now receive an official notification of your intentions to retire from the public employments of your country.</p>
               <p>When we review the various ſcenes of your public life, ſo long and ſo ſucceſsfully devoted to the moſt arduous ſervices, civil and military,—as well during the ſtruggles of the American revolution, as the convulſive periods of a recent date, we cannot look forward to your retirement, without our warmeſt affections and moſt anxious regards accompanying you; and without mingling with our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low citizens at large, the ſincereſt wiſhes for your perſonal happineſs, that ſenſibility and attachment can expreſs.</p>
               <p>The moſt effectual conſolation that can offer for the loſs we are about to ſuſtain, ariſes from the animating reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the influence of your example will extend to your ſucceſſors, and the United States thus continue to enjoy, an able, upright, and energetic adminiſtration.</p>

that theſe, by impreſſing the Indian tribes with more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect conceptions of the juſtice, as well as power of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited States, will be attended with ſucceſs.</p>
                           <p>While we notice, with ſatisfaction, the ſteps that you have taken in purſuance of the late treaties with ſeveral foreign nations, the liberation of our citizens, who were priſoners at Algiers, is a ſubject of peculiar felicitation. We ſhall cheerfully co-operate in any further meaſures that ſhall appear, on conſideration, to be requiſite.</p>
                           <p>We have ever concurred with you in the moſt ſincere and uniform diſpoſition to preſerve our neutral relations inviolate, and it is, of courſe, with anxiety and deep re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret we hear that any interruption of our harmony with the French Republic has occurred: for we feel with you and with our conſtituents, the cordial and unabated wiſh to maintain a perfectly friendly underſtanding with that nation. Your endeavours to fulfil that wiſh, and by all honourable means to preſerve peace and to reſtore that harmony and affection which have heretofore ſo happily ſubſiſted between the French Republic and the United States, cannot fail, therefore, to intereſt our attention.

                           <p>When we advert to the internal ſituation of the United States, we deem it equally natural and becoming to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the preſent period with that immediately antecedent to the operation of the government, and to contraſt it with the calamities in which the ſtate of war ſtill involves ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the European nations, as the reflections deduced from both tend to juſtify as well as to excite, a warmer admiration of our free conſtitution, and to exalt our minds to a more fervent and grateful ſenſe of piety towards Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty

                           <p>And while we entertain a grateful conviction that your wiſe, firm and patriotic adminiſtration has been ſignally conducive to the ſucceſs of the preſent form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we cannot forbear to expreſs the deep ſenſations of regret with which we contemplate your intended retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from office.</p>

Your obedience to the voice of duty and your country, when you quitted re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctantly, a ſecond time, the retreat you had choſen, and firſt accepted the preſidency, afforded a new proof of the devotedneſs of your zeal in its ſervice, and an earneſt of the patriotiſm and ſucceſs which have characterized your adminiſtration.

Some members were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to almoſt every part of it, but their oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was more directly levelled againſt three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular points; the compliment to the Preſident, the paragraph reſpecting the miſunderſtanding with the French Republic, and the expreſſion of the free and enlightened ſtate of the American peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>That a compliment to the Preſident, or rather a faint acknowledgement of his virtues and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices (for on this ſubject any acknowledgement muſt be faint,) ſhould be oppoſed in the Congreſs of the United States, would be cauſe of great mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification to every generous and grateful mind,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:030227_0020_0FE54BDE398C44F0"/>
were it not accompanied with the conſoling reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that <hi>Mr. Giles</hi> was at the head of the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. There are certain perſons, whoſe applauſe we ſhun with as much ſolicitude as we ſeek for that of others, and I muſt confeſs, there are few men in the world whoſe praiſes I ſhould dread more than thoſe of the Virginian Giles, and I dare ſay the Preſident is very happy to think that he has eſcaped them.</p>
               <p>The anſwer expreſſes a grateful conviction of the Preſident's <hi>wiſe, firm,</hi> and <hi>patriotic</hi> admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, and regrets his departure from office. To all this the virtuous and upright Mr. Giles objected. He ſaid, that
<q>the Preſident's admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration had been neither <hi>wiſe</hi> nor <hi>firm;</hi> and as to his departure from office, he felt not the leaſt regret on account of it. He hoped he would retire to his country ſeat, and live comfortably there. He believed the government of the United States would go on without him. <hi>The people</hi> were competent to their <hi>own</hi> government. That for thoſe, who had oppoſed ſome of the principal meaſures of the Preſident, to vote for the anſwer in its preſent form, would be <hi>writing ſcoundrel on their foreheads.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>It would be uſeleſs to take up mine and my read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's time in a juſtification of the compliment to which Mr. Giles was oppoſed. The people of the United States, from one end of the Union to the other, have unequivocally expreſſed, what this gentleman is afraid to expreſs, leſt thereby he ſhould write ſcoundrel on his forehead. If the reader will look back to the Cenſor for April laſt, he will find this ſame patriot declaring, that he <hi>adored</hi> the voice of the people, and yet he has
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030227_0021_0FE54BDFCE9BDA58"/>
now the temerity to doubt its infallibility, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe obedience to it, even to mutiny againſt and offer reſiſtance to its <hi>awful</hi> commands. If ever I derived an extraordinary degree of ſatisfaction from the embarraſſment of others, it was on ſeeing Mr. Giles and his brother patriots, the votaries of the popular voice, reduced to take the <hi>unpopular</hi> ſide of a queſtion. The leader ſeems to have been ſenſible of the awkwardneſs of his ſituation, when he ſaid that
<q>
                     <hi>the people</hi> are competent to their <hi>own</hi> government.</q>
This was a kind of palliative, it was ſhifting the ground of oppoſition, it was a poor miſerable attempt to preſerve conſiſtency, and betrayed either a total want of diſcernment in the ſpeaker, or a conſummate contempt for the underſtandings of the people: for, if the people are competent to their own government, they are certainly competent to form a judgment of the conduct of the Preſident, and as they have declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his adminiſtration to be wiſe, firm and patrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic, how dared their zealous and pious adorer to ſay they are miſtaken?</p>
               <p>As to <hi>writing ſcoundrel on his front,</hi> of which Mr. Giles ſeemed to entertain ſuch unneceſſary fears, if the approving of the compliment in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would produce this effect, all the members of the ſtate legiſlatures, and nine-tenths of their conſtituents, had already taken the hideous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription. What a ſcoundrelly god, then, does Mr. Giles adore? If an obſtinate oppoſition to all the moſt important meaſures of an adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the anſwer approves of in the aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, was calculated to imprint the terrific word, voting for the anſwer could do no more than ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der legible what was already written; as charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in certain liquids remain imperceptible till
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:030227_0022_0FE54BE2021883A8"/>
drawn forth by the fire. Mr. Giles and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low labourers prudently ſhrank from the ordeal; but they will excuſe us, if our imaginations ſhould ſupply its place. Read we aſſuredly ſhall, and it will be nothing very extraordinary if we ſhould extend the ſignification of every term that we think we perceive.</p>
               <p>The next ſubject of oppoſition was the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph which ſpeaks of the miſunderſtanding with the bloody Gallican Republic. In the reported anſwer it ſtood thus:
<q>We have ever concurred with you in the moſt ſincere and uniform diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to preſerve our mutual relations invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and it is, of courſe, with anxiety and deep regret we hear that any interruption of our har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony with the French Republic has occurred: for we feel with you, and with our conſtituents, the cordial and unabated wiſh, to maintain a perfectly friendly underſtanding with that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Your endeavours to fulfil that wiſh can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail therefore to intereſt our attention. And while we participate in the full reliance you have expreſſed on the patriotiſm, ſelf-reſpect and fortitude of our countrymen, we cheriſh the pleaſing hope, that a ſpirit of juſtice and moderation will enſure the ſucceſs of your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This was certainly tame enough, after all the outrages and inſults of France. The deſire to re-eſtabliſh harmony is expreſſed, as <hi>Mr. Ames</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, with little leſs ardour than the requeſts of a ſupplicating lover; and the confidence in the ſpirit of the country, in caſe of an appeal to arms, is diſguiſed with as much care, as if it were a crime to be courageous in oppoſing the violence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:030227_0023_0FE54BE8A1116888"/>
the indignities of a horde of baſe-born grovelling tyrants.</p>
               <p>How different from this heſitating tone was that of the Senate: "We are," ſay they,
<q>not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful of the ſituation in which events may place us, <hi>nor unprepared to adopt that ſyſtem of conduct, which, compatible with the dignity of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable nation, neceſſity may compel us to purſue.</hi>
                  </q>
This manly anſwer does infinite honour to the man who penned it, and let the inſolent convention re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect, that it was approved of by him with whom they will in future be obliged to treat.</p>
               <p>The anſwer of the Senate was all that could be wiſhed, but it ſhould have been ſurpaſſed in warmth by thoſe who call themſelves the <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate</hi> repreſentatives of the people. Language that may be extremely proper, at ſuch a criſis, from cool and diſpaſſionate Senators, whoſe buſineſs is rather to check than to encourage the ardour of the public ſpirit, may be poor and cold when coming from the Repreſentatives. Every ſentence from them ſhould have ſmoked with indignation at the inſupportable inſolence of the French; they ſhould have declared, that they were ready with their lives to defend that independence, which had been ſo openly attacked, and to ſupport the government in every energetic meaſure it ſhould take to obtain ſatisfaction for the indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that had been heaped on it. Yet, ſo far from this was the conduct of the Houſe, that even the paragraph above quoted was not humble enough for them: not content with expreſſing their <hi>anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety</hi> and <hi>deep regret</hi> at the interruption of <hi>harmony,</hi> and their <hi>unabated</hi> wiſh to maintain a <hi>perfectly friendly</hi> underſtanding, with the nation who had
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:030227_0024_0FE54BEA48627430"/>
robbed, deſpiſed, and openly inſulted them and their country, they muſt needs add another ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, wiſhing for the reſtoration of that <hi>harmony</hi> and <hi>affection,</hi> which had hitherto ſo <hi>happily</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted. Not content with amplifying their tremu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous accents till the quaver had loſt the ſound of manhood, they muſt needs begin <hi>da Capo</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat the faltering tune. Nay, the laſt ſentence of the paragraph, which ſpeaks of a ſpirit of <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>moderation,</hi> could not paſs without being crammed with the word <hi>mutual.</hi> Mr. Giles, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, wiſhed to tack another phraſe; viz. <hi>"on the part of the Republic,"</hi> to the end of this word <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.</hi> He ſeemed to think that the anſwer would be incomplete without a little <hi>nonsense.—</hi>
                  <q>That a <hi>mutual</hi> ſpirit of juſtice and moderation <hi>on the part of the Republic</hi> will enſure the ſucceſs of your perſeverance.</q>—If you can go to the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day-Schools round the city, and find me a boy out of his primer, ſtupid and illiterate enough to compoſe a ſentence like this, I will be bound to find you men in Virginia, who ſhall vote him into Congreſs.— "<hi>The</hi> Republic," too. <hi>What</hi> Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic? Is not America a Republic as well as France? The French King forbade his ſubjects to addreſs him, or ſpeak of him, under any other name than ſimply that of <hi>the</hi> King, as if there were but one king in the world; juſt as we ſpeak of the Sun or the Moon. The deſpots who have cut his throat, ſeem to have taken poſſeſſion of his vanity as well as of his houſes, his gardens, his coaches and his jewels. They call their poor beggared enſlaved country <hi>the</hi> Republic. But other kingdoms ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver obſerved this ſtyle of eminence towards the French monarch, nor will it be obſerved towards the French Republic, I truſt, by any other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public, or any other mortal except Mr. Giles. It
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:030227_0025_0FE54BEBD7EC34E0"/>
would ſeem that the gentleman forgot where he was, and looked upon himſelf as a repreſentative of the ſwarthy French, inſtead of the more hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and more enlightened, though ſooty, citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of the ancient dominion.</p>
               <p>The imagination of this man, and of all thoſe who voted with him, appears to have been upon the rack to find out terms expreſſive of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on the generoſity and magnanimity of the inſulting foe, and of their want of confidence in the people of this country. Was this what the Preſident expected, when he complained to them of the aggreſſions of the French, and of the threats he had received from their miniſter? Was this what the people expected, when that inſolent miniſter appealed to them from their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? No; they expected no ſuch milk-ſop tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tology. They expected a good, plain, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute tone, calculated to convince the treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous French, that their independence was not a mere name, and that, while a deſire of peace dwelt in their breaſts, fear of a war found no place there.</p>
               <p>It was ſaid by thoſe who oppoſed the introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that redundancy of <hi>affection,</hi> which now diſhonours the anſwer, that the firſt draught was dictated by a ſpirit of accommodation; and, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, this was evidently the caſe, for no one who knows Meſſrs. Ames and Sitgreaves, and reads their animated ſpeeches in the debate, will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that this draught was dictated by their feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. My complaiſance, however, would not have carried me ſo far; I would have ſtood alone in the Houſe; I would have oppoſed every ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, every word, and every ſyllable, that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:030227_0026_0FE54BEDF03B9860"/>
of tameneſs, that indicated a reliance on the <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>moderation</hi> of the French, or a fear of encountering their diſpleaſure.</p>
               <p>The third ſubject of oppoſition was, that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in the anſwer which ſtyles the people of America
<q>the freeſt and moſt enlightened in the world;</q>
and who could help being ſurpriſed that the <hi>adorer</hi> of the <hi>people</hi> ſhould take the lead here alſo! One would imagine, that to be proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of adoration, they ſhould at leaſt be the moſt free and enlightened in the world; unleſs we ſuppoſe that Mr. Giles adored them for their purity and virtue, which there is very little reaſon to do.</p>
               <p>Theſe words were at laſt changed for,
<q>a free and enlightened people.</q>
The cauſe of this (with ſhame be it ſpoken) was, <hi>fear of offending the French Convention,</hi> an aſſembly that every worthy American longs to ſpit upon; an aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly whoſe approbation is a mark of diſhonour ten thouſand times greater than ſtanding in the pillory or being burnt in the hand. Talk of writing ſcoundrel in the forehead! I would ſooner bear the word ſcoundrel as a motto round the pupils of my eyes, than be blaſted with the approving grin of a gang of aſſaſſins.</p>
               <p>That the cauſe of the oppoſition was what I have ſtated it, muſt be clear to every one who recollects the language of the members who took a part in it, on other occaſions. There is hardly a people in Europe, except the French, whom they have not, at different times, ſince the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent war, repreſented as buried in ſlavery and brutal ignorance. They inſiſted that the Houſe
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:030227_0027_0FE54BF0C5E6D958"/>
had no right to caſt reflections on foreign nations; what right had Mr. Giles, then, to caſt reflections on the government and parliament of Britain? What right had another member to call the Empreſs of Ruſſia a ſhe-bear, another, the King of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a robber, and another, all kings in general a herd of crowned monſters? "The fact may be true," ſaid they,
<q>but we have no right to ſtep beyond the boundaries of our own country to contraſt it with any other.</q>
Now, what did the pretty Mr. Livingſton, who was one of theſe inoffenſive and modeſt gentlemen, do laſt ſeſſion.?—<q>Great Britain, was <hi>once</hi> free; but now Great Britain, and <hi>all Europe,</hi> France <hi>except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> is <hi>in chains!</hi>
                  </q>—Was this ſtepping beyond the boundary line? This was not being content with eulogium on America, but was openly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting every nation of Europe, <hi>except the French,</hi> the <hi>free</hi> and <hi>enlightened</hi> heroes of the <hi>Bloody Buoy.</hi> But, why need we go back to paſt ſeſſions, when in the preſent one, and even in this debate, and on this very queſtion, we hear the delicate Mr. Parker exclaim:
<q>Kingcraft and prieſtcraft have too long governed the world with an iron rod: more enlightened times, I truſt, are approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and I hope ere long <hi>republicaniſm</hi> will cover the earth.</q>—Like the univerſal deluge I ſuppoſe.</p>
               <p>It is pretty clear from this ſally of Mr. Parker, that no nations were to be excepted but thoſe who are, or call themſelves, republics. This might have done very well, and the anſwer might have been thus amended with ſome little conſiſtency, but poor Mr. Parker has a ſhort memory, and being preſſed hard by Mr. William Smith, who truly aſſerted that fear of giving umbrage to the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:030227_0028_0FE54BF44F5E9200"/>
French, was at the bottom of the oppoſition, he tacked ſhort about, and ran headlong into the moſt monſtrous contradiction that ever bemired a poor orator.—"No;" ſaid he,
<q>I have not the French republic, or any other nation in view; the Swiſs Cantons have ſhown themſelves more enlightened than we.</q>—All was well yet, but Mr. Parker, like moſt other eloquent men, is very fond of enumeration, and he unfortunately added the <hi>Danes</hi> and the <hi>Swedes.</hi> Theſe nations alſo, he ſaid, were more enlightened than the people of America, though, in the ſame ſpeech, he declared that <hi>King-craft</hi> had too long govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the world with an iron rod, and hoped that more enlightened times were at hand, and that republicaniſm would ſoon cover the earth! He could not be ſo very ignorant, or at leaſt I ſhould ſuppoſe ſo, as not to know that Denmark and Sweden are governed by kings; but he was hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med up in a corner, and did not know where to look for more enlightened republics than his own, <hi>except France.</hi>—A legiſlator ſhould always un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand geography and aſtronomy, and then "his eye in a fine fit of frenzy rolling," might, as Doctor Ruth ſays Rittenhouſe did, find out re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publics in the moon. However, a very little ſtudy of the former ſcience, might have led Mr. Parker, in his jump from Switzerland to Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, to perceive the dear ſiſter republic of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavia.</hi> Here he might have found a triumphant compariſon. Republicaniſm has enlightened the Dutch with a vengeance. The ſans-culottes have worn them down till you may read a newſpaper through their ribs. <hi>Geneva</hi> too, which was ſo near him when he was got among the Swiſs, might, one would have thought, have claimed a
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:030227_0029_0FE54BF5DD674090"/>
preference to Denmark and Sweden; particularly as the cheering rays of republicaniſm have been communicated to it by the great luminary which ſeems to be the ſole object of his admiration.</p>
               <p>Mr. Parker moved for ſtriking out the words, "freeſt and moſt enlightened." This Mr. Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie propoſed to amend, by inſerting,
<q>free-eſt, and <hi>amongst</hi> the moſt enlightened;</q>
but ſtill Mr. Swanwick thought the word <hi>"amongst"</hi> ſhould come before, inſtead of after
<q>
                     <hi>free-eſt;</hi> becauſe nothing could tend more to <hi>preſerve the peace</hi> of the country, than <hi>treating others with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect;</hi>
                  </q>
and in this opinion he was joined by Meſſrs. Coit and Dayton, the latter of whom moſt humbly thought, that
<q>the amendment very much <hi>ſoftened</hi> the terms, and rendered them <hi>more palatable.</hi>
                  </q>—At laſt, after theſe four words had undergone juſt as many changes as can be rung upon four bells, the peal was cloſed with, "<hi>free</hi> and <hi>enlightened</hi> people."</p>
               <p>Gracious heaven! and have I lived to hear the American Congreſs, men whoſe brow I had been taught to believe <hi>independence</hi> had made its choſen ſeat, haggling three whole days about four words of compliment to their country, and at laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punge them, leſt they ſhould give offence to a foreign nation! Mr. Livingſton and the news-monger Brown may dun us as long as they pleaſe about the ſlavery of Britons, but if a member of their Houſe of Commons were timid enough to expreſs his <hi>ſears</hi> at calling his nation the free-eſt and moſt enlightened in the world, I flatter my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf he would never dare ſhow his face again in that aſſembly. For a nation, which dares not paſs on itſelf whatever compliment or encomium
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:030227_0030_0FE54BF810D5B140"/>
it pleaſes, to call itſelf <hi>free</hi> and <hi>independent,</hi> is an abuſe of words that nothing can be a ſufficient puniſhment for, except the conſciouſneſs of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and of being thought, exactly the contrary of what it ſtrives to appear.</p>
               <p>That the amendment ſhould be adopted at all, is a circumſtance in itſelf ſufficiently humiliating; but, when we conſider that it was adopted for fear of giving umbrage to France; when we conſider that the repreſentatives of the people thought it unfitting to declare them more <hi>free</hi> and <hi>enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> than the baſe, the willing ſlaves, the brutiſhly ignorant and illiterate wretches left in the French territory, we feel our ſuperiority inſulted, and deſpiſe the man who would ſhrink from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration.</p>
               <p>In that <hi>free</hi> country, France, the parent dares not yield protection to his child, nor the child to his parent, without the previous conſent of ſome petty underſtrapping deſpot. Man poſſeſſes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; his property belongs to a mob of tyrants, who call themſelves the nation, who hold his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and his very carcaſs in a ſtate of requiſition. If his griefs break out into complaint, he is dragged to a tribunal, where <hi>no evidence is required.</hi> A ſhrug, a look, a tear, or a ſigh, betrays him. To repine at the cruelty of his fate is to be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and to be ſuſpected is death.</p>
               <p>We need not ſtretch our view acroſs the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantic for ſpecimens of French liberty; we may ſee enough without quitting our own country, or even our houſes. The <hi>cockade proclamation</hi> of Citizen Adet is at once an inſult to the United States, and an act of abominable tyranny on the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:030227_0031_0FE54BFCFB00F718"/>
unfortunate French who have taken a refuge in them. They muſt not only ſuffer ſhame for their country, but muſt bear about them the ſign of its diſgrace, the livery of the infamous Orleans. They muſt not only be deſpoiled of their wealth, and driven from their homes and their families, but muſt drag their chains into diſtant lands. It is not enough that they ſhould be branded with the name of ſlave; they muſt wear the ſymbol of their ſlavery, and that, too, exactly where other men wear the ſymbol of courage and of honour!— Will not the people of America bluſh to think, that their repreſentatives were afraid to aſſert, that they enjoyed a degree of freedom ſuperior to this?</p>
               <p>Of the <hi>enlightened</hi> people, now called the French nation, not one out of five hundred can ſpell his own name. As to religion, four years ago they were ſeen kneeling with their faces prone to the earth, blubbering out their ſins, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching abſolution from the men whom, in a year afterwards, they degraded, inſulted, muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated and murdered. After changing the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic worſhip, at the command of one gang of tyrants, for a worſhip that was neither catholic nor proteſtant; at the command of another, they abandoned all worſhip whatſoever, and publicly rejoiced that
<q>the ſoul of man was like that of the beaſt.</q>
A third gang orders them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that there is a god: inſtantly the ſubmiſſive brutes acknowledge his exiſtence, and fall on their knees at the ſight of Robeſpierre, proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the decree, with as much devotion as they formerly did at the elevation of the ſacred hoſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="unknown:030227_0032_0FE54BFF38C6F920"/>Politically conſidered, they are equally <hi>enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened.</hi> Every ſucceſſive faction has been the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their huzzas, in the day of its power, and of their execrations in that of its fall. They crowded to the bar of the Convention to felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Robeſpierre on his eſcape from the poignard of a woman; and, in leſs than ſix weeks after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, danced round his ſcaffold, and mocked his dying groans.—Firſt they approve of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution with a hereditary monarch, whoſe perſon they declare <hi>inviolable</hi> and <hi>ſacred,</hi> and ſwear to defend him with their lives. Next they murder this monarch, and declare themſelves a republic, to be governed by a ſingle chamber of delegates. This ſecond conſtitution they deſtroy, and frame a third, with two chambers and five co-equal kings.—After having ſpent five years in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing war, in the name of liberty and equality, upon arms, ſtars, garters, croſſes, and every other exterior ſign of ſuperiority of rank, they very peaceably and tamely ſuffer their maſters to dub themſelves with what titles they pleaſe, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively to aſſume garbs and badges of diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion far more numerous than thoſe which former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exiſted in France.</p>
               <p>But, the circumſtance beſt calculated to give a juſt idea of their baſeneſs of ſpirit and ſwiniſh ignorance, is, their ſanctioning a conſtitution, which declares that they ſhall elect the members of their aſſemblies, and then ſubmitting to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, obliging them to chooſe two-thirds of the number out of the Convention. Nor was this all; the Convention, not content with enſuring the re-election of theſe two-thirds, reſerved to itſelf the power of rejecting ſuch members of the other third as it might not approve of!—And yet

the wiſe Mr. Parker calls the French "a <hi>free</hi> and <hi>enlightened</hi> people," and very piouſly wiſhes that <hi>King-craft</hi> may be done away, and that <hi>repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licaniſm</hi> may <hi>enlighten</hi> the whole earth!—The Houſe of Repreſentatives were afraid even to hint that this nation of poor, cajoled, cozened, bullied, bamboozled devils, were leſs enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than the people of America!</p>
               <p>There is not a true American, and I love to believe that a very great majority of the people of theſe ſtates are of that deſcription, who does not reject with ſcorn the idea of being upon a level with the regenerated French; not only in underſtanding, but in any reſpect whatever. Their very friends, the Democrats, nay their beſt paid hirelings, deſpiſe them in their hearts, as much as a proſtitute deſpiſes her cully.</p>
               <p>After having contemplated the modeſt and humble tone of the Antifederal members towards France, it may not be amiſs to contraſt it with their language towards Great Britain, on an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſomewhat ſimilar.—It was reported, that His Britannic Majeſty had iſſued inſtructions for ſeizing American veſſels, contrary to the law of nations. It was, indeed, well known that many veſſels were ſeized; but it was not known that the ſeizure was authoriſed by theſe inſtructions. They were equivocal, and therefore left room to hope that they were miſconſtrued, by intereſted individuals, and that an indemnification would be obtained by a manly and temperate repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the injury. This hope, which was then entertained by the friends of the federal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, has ſince been completely realized. But, what was the tone of Mr. Madiſon, Mr. Clarke,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:030227_0034_0FE54C02EA0E20E8"/>
Mr. Dayton, and all thoſe who are now for ſoften<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their language towards France, till it ſurpaſſes in effeminacy the pipe of a ſickly girl? What were the meaſures they then propoſed? <hi>Lay a double duty on their goods,</hi> ſaid one; <hi>Prohibit all trade with them,</hi> ſaid another; and Mr. Dayton offered a reſolution for
<q>ſequeſtrating all debts due from the citizens of the United States to the ſubjects of the king of Great Britain.</q>—
Thus, without waiting a moment to inquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the king's inſtructions were miſinterpreted, or whether an indemnification was likely to be obtained, the ſeizure was to be regarded as a commencement of hoſtilities; repriſals were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to be made, and that, too, in a mode that every honourable and honeſt man turns from with ſcorn.—Was this very <hi>"palatable,"</hi> Mr. Dayton?</p>
               <p>It was during this memorable debate, that Mr. Smith from Maryland, <hi>modeſtly</hi> exclaimed:—
<q>Let us adopt the reſolution. It will arreſt <hi>twenty millions</hi> of dollars in our hands, as a fund to reimburſe the <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four</hi> millions, which we have been ſtripped of by that <hi>piratical nation,</hi> Great Britain, according to the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of that <hi>king of ſea-robbers,</hi> that <hi>Leviathan</hi> who aims at ſwallowing up all that ſwims on the ocean, that <hi>monſter,</hi> whoſe only law is power, and who reſpects neither the rights of nations, nor the property of individuals.</q>—
Was this <hi>decent</hi> and <hi>honeſt</hi> ſpeech very
"palat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able?"—Theſe political cooks ſeem to be very ſkilful in diſtinguiſhing the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the palates of Britons and that of the ſoupe-maigre, frog-eating French, who can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh nothing that is not<hi>bien cuit,</hi> or coddled to
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:030227_0035_0FE54C09DCD88D50"/>
mummy, except the fleſh and blood of ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crats.</p>
               <p>Striking as this contraſt is, it is not ſeen in its proper light, till accompanied with a compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive view of the injuries received from the two nations. The Britiſh, when they were called <hi>pirates, ſea-robbers,</hi> and <hi>monſters,</hi> by a member of Congreſs, had unlawfully ſeized on American property, to the amount of
<q>
                     <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four</hi> mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of dollars.</q>
The French, even at that time, were guilty of the ſame aggreſſions, and of this the Congreſs could not plead ignorance, as it was ſtated to them by order of the Preſident, in the ſame report that complains of the conduct of the Britiſh. At the preſent epoch it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that the depredations of the French are double in amount to thoſe of the Britiſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any indemnification was obtained. But, to avoid all diſpute on this ſubject, let us ſuppoſe that the loſs from both nations to be of exactly the ſame amount, and confine our remarks to the vaſt difference in their anterior ſituation and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent conduct with reſpect to this country. Great Britain had no treaty, either of amity or commerce, with America; her conduct towards us, therefore, was ſubject to no rule but that preſcribed by the general law of nations, the principles of which, often leaving room for miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpretation, give a ſcope to an abuſe of power, that does not, if reparation be demanded and obtained, fix the ſtigma of cowardice or depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on the injured nation. The ſituation of the French was quite different. The depreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions committed by them are in direct violation of a ſolemn contract, voluntarily entered into with America. Great Britain excuſed herſelf by
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:030227_0036_0FE54C0BC39E8380"/>
declaring (whether truly or not is no matter) that her orders had been miſconſtrued, that ſhe was ready to make reſtitution, and it is well known that ſhe has made good this declaration, by pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the full value of the cargoes and veſſels ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally ſeized. But, the conduct of the French leaves no room for an excuſe. They cannot plead a miſconſtruction of their orders, their ſpoliations have not taken place under an ambiguous inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but are warranted by a decree of their tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical aſſembly; and, to deprive America of the hope of indemnification, and even of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of maintaining her rights, they have hurled this decree in our teeth. The Britiſh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully ſeized on the property of Americans, or, if you will, in the polite language of Maryland Mr. Smith, that nation of "monſters" robbed them; but the miniſter of theſe "monſters" did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the plundering order in this country, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the people whom they had robbed, by telling them that it was the fault of their own Executive. The French have done all this and ten times more: they have trampled upon the indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Americans, braved them, ſcoffed at them; they have done every thing but kick the Preſident from his chair and take poſſeſſion of the government: and yet Mr. Dayton, the <hi>ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getic</hi> Mr. Dayton, ſays not a word about <hi>ſequeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration;</hi> he is even afraid to compliment his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituents on their <hi>freedom</hi> and <hi>underſtanding,</hi> leſt it ſhould be <hi>unpalatable</hi> to this inſidious, treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and inſolent nation. Not a word do we now hear about
<q>
                     <hi>pirates</hi> and <hi>ſea-robbers,</hi> and <hi>levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans,</hi> and <hi>monſters:</hi>
                  </q>
all breathes a deſire to cultivate
<q>harmony, perfect friendſhip, <hi>and</hi> affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q>
In ſpeaking of the depredations of the
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:030227_0037_0FE54C0D9ADD0788"/>
Britiſh, "nothing," it was ſaid,
<q>was to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from the <hi>juſtice</hi> of a nation who had robbed us;</q>
but now, behold, every thing is to be left to the <hi>"juſtice</hi> and <hi>moderation"</hi> of the French, after we are not only well aſſured that their robberies have far ſurpaſſed thoſe of the Britiſh, but after their miniſter as contemptuouſly told us, that thoſe robberies are ſanctioned by his government; that it has given orders for vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the treaty, and is determined to continue in the violation. Thus, one nation is ſpoken of with approbation, eſteem and affection; is even flattered and careſſed, after loading us with inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries a thouſand times greater than thoſe which drew down on another nation the indecent and opprobrious terms of <hi>"pirates</hi> and <hi>monſters."</hi> Is this a proof of the candour or of the obſtinate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, of the wiſdom or folly, of the Houſe of Repreſentatives? Is it a proof of the indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of America on Great Britain, or of its ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject dependence on France?</p>
               <p>To what are we to aſcribe the immeaſurable difference between the daring and inſulting tone formerly aſſumed towards Britain, and the poor, piping, puſillanimous language, that is now held towards France. Is it becauſe one is a monarchy, and the other calls itſelf a republic? I have heard, or read, of a fellow that was ſo accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be kicked, that he could diſtinguiſh, by the feel, the ſort of leather that aſſailed his poſteriors. Are our buttocks arrived at this perfection of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility? And do we really find that a republican ſhoe wounds our honour leſs than a monarchical one? Is an injury from a nation on whom we heaped every term of abuſe, and for whoſe anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation we, and even ſome of our parſons, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:030227_0038_0FE54C0FB195D130"/>
prayed, leſs calculated to rouſe our feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, than the accumulated injuries and inſults of another nation, whom we diſtinguiſhed by every ſign of partiality, for whoſe misfortunes we put on mourning, and for whoſe victories we mocked and inſulted heaven with thankſgiving? Is a ſingle ſlap on the cheek from a power, with whom we had no connection, leſs offenſive than reiterated blows from an <hi>ally?</hi> Finally, is the commerce of Britain leſs neceſſary to America than that of France, or is the power of the latter more to be dreaded than that of the former?—This laſt queſtion is the only one that requires to be examined: the reſt, I truſt, are already anſwered in the mind of the reader.</p>
               <p>The neceſſity of a commercial connection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Great Britain and America, is ſo loudly and unequivocally aſſerted by the unerring voice of experience, that nothing but the blindeſt ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, or the moſt unconquerable prejudice, could poſſibly have called it in queſtion. Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the ſuſpenſion of this commerce, cauſed by the revolutionary war, it was on both ſides reſumed with more ardour than ever, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the arts that France and her par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizans employed to prevent it. In vain did poor Louis iſſue edicts to encourage his people to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant their rivals, in vain did he take off his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and offer premiums; in vain did friend Briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſot coax the Quakers, and citizen Madiſon ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ify the Congreſs: in ſpite of all their fine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, cajoling, and wheedling; in ſpite of the mortification of Britain, and the more powerful prejudice of America, no ſooner was the obſtacle removed by the return of peace, than, without a treaty of friendſhip or commerce, without any
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:030227_0039_0FE54C15AC9E39D8"/>
other ſtimulus than mutual intereſt, confidence and inclination, the two countries ruſhed together like congenial waters that had been ſeparated by an artificial dyke.</p>
               <p>It is this natural connection with Britain, the Britiſh capital, which a confidence in the ſtability of the government invites hither, together with the credit that the merchants of that country give to thoſe of this, a credit which Britiſh merchants alone are either willing or able to give, that forms the great ſource of American wealth. Mr. Smith from Maryland, the <hi>polite</hi> Mr. Smith, who called the Britiſh <hi>"ſea-robbers</hi> and <hi>monſters,"</hi> incauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly acknowledged, in the ſame breath, that theſe "monſters" gave a ſtationary credit to this country amounting to <hi>twenty millions of dollars.</hi> Grateful gentleman!—A very great part of this credit is given for a twelve-month at leaſt; ſo that the ſimple intereſt on it amounts to <hi>one million two hundred thouſand dollars annually;</hi> an advantage to this country that might have merited in return ſomething <hi>"more palatable"</hi> than "<hi>ſea-robbers</hi> and <hi>"monſters."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If America could obtain what ſhe ſtands in need of (which ſhe cannot) from any other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try than Britain, from what country on earth could ſhe obtain them on terms like theſe? The capacity of France, in the brighteſt days of her commercial proſperity, was fairly tried. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondencies were opened with her merchants; but what was the reſult? The total ruin of them and of all thoſe who were concerned with them. They are no more; they are forgotten. Their trade could be equalled in ſhortneſs of duration by nothing but the wear of their merchandiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="unknown:030227_0040_0FE54C1742BE31B8"/>To ſay, as ſome of the French faction have done, that America does not want the manufactures of Britain, is an inſult on the national diſcernment little ſhort of the <hi>Blunderbuſs</hi> of my old friend Citizen Adet. Let any man take a view of his dreſs (when he is dreſſed like a man), from head to foot, from the garments that he wears to ſea, to plough, to market or to church, down to thoſe with which he ſteps into bed; let him look round his ſhop, and round the ſhops of his neighbours; let him examine his library, his bed-chamber, his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and his kitchen, and then let him ſay how great a part of all he ſees, of all that is indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable, uſeful or convenient; let him ſay how great a part of all this comes from Great Britain, and how ſmall a one from France or any other country; and then, if he be fool enough, let him ſay with the Gallican faction, that we ſtand in no need of the manufactures of Britain.</p>
               <p>The commercial connection between this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Great Britain is full as neceſſary as that between the baker and miller, while the connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between America and France may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to one between the baker and the milliner or toyman. France may furniſh us with looking glaſſes; but without the aid of Britain we ſhall be aſhamed to ſee ourſelves in them, unleſs the ſans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culottes can perſuade us that thread-bare beggary is a beauty. France may deck the heads of our wives and daughters (but by the bye, ſhe ſhan't thoſe of mine) with ribbons, gauze, and powder, their ears with bobs, their cheeks with paint, and their heels with gaudy party-coloured ſilk, as rotten as the hearts of the manufacturers; but Great Britain muſt cover their and our bodies. When the rain pours down and waſhes the roſe
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:030227_0041_0FE54C18D39F8770"/>
from the cheek; when the bleak north-weſter blows through the gauze, then it is that we know our friends. Great Britain muſt wrap us up warm, and keep us all decent, ſnug and comfortable, from the child in ſwaddling cloths to its tottering grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. France may ſend us cockades, as ſhe does (or has done) in abundance; but Great Britain muſt ſend us hats to ſtick them in. France may furniſh the ruffle, but Great Britain muſt ſend us the ſhirt; and the commerce of the latter nation is juſt as much more neceſſary to this country than that of the former, as a good decent ſhirt is more neceſſary than a paltry diſhclout of a ruffle.</p>
               <p>As, then, the importance of a trade, with any nation, muſt be the ſtandard whereby to meaſure the embarraſſment and diſtreſs that its ſuſpenſion would produce, it is evident that a war with Great Britain would, in this reſpect, have been productive of infinite calamities to America, while a war with France would hardly be felt. The dangers, therefore, to be apprehended from mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary operations only, remain to be conſidered.</p>
               <p>By going back to the epoch when the hoſtile tone was aſſumed towards Great Britain, I could repreſent her as in poſſeſſion of the <hi>Weſtern Poſts,</hi> and conſequently as in a ſituation to arm and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Indians, to harraſs that frontier, and by thoſe means find employment for an army of the United States, and that a very expenſive one too. But, I ſhall decline this advantage, ſhall conſider things in their preſent ſtate; I ſhall even ſuppoſe all inroads from Canada impoſſible, ſhall turn my eyes to the ſea only, and there take a view of
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:030227_0042_0FE54C1AE92F51D8"/>
what might be reaſonably feared from a war with Great Britain, and what from a war with France.</p>
               <p>The mighty difference in the maritime power, ſkill and courage of the two nations, is ſo univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally known, and has undergone ſo many and ſo convincing proofs during the preſent war, that any compariſon in this reſpect would be ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. The hirelings of France, do, however, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that ſhe could eat us up alive, crack us as a ſquirrel does a nut, while we could boldly bid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance to her rival. I ſhall not ſuppoſe it poſſible for Great Britain to bombard our towns and burn our ſhipping, I ſhall look upon all our harbours as completely defended; I ſhall even ſuppoſe it impoſſible for her to make a landing on any part of our coaſt, to carry off a ſingle ſack of flour or head of cattle; and only inſiſt, that, with thirty detached frigates and a ſquadron of twenty ſhips of the line, ſhe could completely block up every principal port in the United States, in defiance of the French and their new allies, Holland and Spain. If I am told to look back to what ſhe was able to do, in this way, laſt war; I reply, that the commerce, the foreign relationſhips, of this country, are not now what they were then, nor would the ſpecies of war, carried on by Britain, be the ſame. Then ſhe had armies on the land, on which the operations of her fleet were depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. It had garriſons to ſupply, convoys to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cort, and tranſports to conduct from one ſtate to another. Thoſe who look to France and her al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies for relief, forget that during this war France has loſt <hi>thirty-nine</hi> ſhips of the line, with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate number of frigates; that the remnant of her ſhattered fleet is now blocked up in her own ports, and that her petty armaments ſkulk
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:030227_0043_0FE54C1E6786A318"/>
about from harbour to harbour, as if their only object was to keep out of ſight. They forget that the Dutch dare not peep out of the Texel, and that the Spaniards, after muſtering their all together, are ſtationed before a place of refuge in the Mediterranean. In this ſituation of things nothing could prevent Great Britain from totally cutting off the commerce of America, exports as well as imports, trebling the price of every ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of foreign manufacture, and rendering the produce of the land a drug; deſtroying the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of the country at the very moment that a tenfold augmentation of it would be neceſſary.</p>
               <p>From the French and their allies, on the contrary, America has little, nay nothing to fear. When we are told about their demoliſhing our towns and invading our country, it ſeems to be forgotten that they muſt croſs the ſea to come to us. Fear ſeems to have deranged the trembling wretches who hold this language. They talk and think about the proweſs of the barbarian armies, till they imagine us divided from them by a river only, or that it is as eaſy for a hundred thouſand of them to be ſhipped off and landed in America, as for them to croſs the Rhine; they imagine that a fleet of three hundred tranſports and fifty ſhips of the line as eaſily erected as a bridge of boats. And, during this terrific reverie, it never once ſtrikes them that Great Britain is at war with the French, or that her fleets would blow them to atoms, before they could approach our coaſt. Mr. Giles, and all thoſe who talk about the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of incurring the diſpleaſure of the French, delight in repreſenting her as ready to make an attack on us in conjunction with the Spaniards. This is true, and we are informed that they have
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:030227_0044_0FE54C2190C84F78"/>
already ſet theſe their "natural allies," to ſeize and confiſcate our veſſels <note n="*" place="bottom">It is pretended by France, that our treaty with Britain contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venes that with her; and for that reaſon ſhe ſeizes our veſſels. Groundleſs and inſolent as this pretext is, it is worth noticing now that the Spaniards have begun to imitate her. We had <hi>no treaty</hi> with them, when that with Great Britain was formed, and therefore, I preſume, that the "<hi>magnanimous</hi> Spaniſh monarch," as Mr. Swanwick called him, will allege that our treaty with him was contravened <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was made;</hi> nor ſhould I much wonder, if members in Congreſs were to be found, courageous and patriotic enough to attempt to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the charge.—This is all that is wanted to fill up the meaſure of our humiliation.</note>. There is no doubt but both nations would willingly co-operate in ſuch an enterprize; but I would aſk Mr. Giles ſeriouſly, whether he thinks America would ſtand ſingly in the war; whether he thinks the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or the people ſo incorrigibly blind and ſtupid, as, while they ſee the French calling in all hell to their aid, to refuſe the only aſſiſtance capable of repulſing the infernal hoſt.—Oh, Lord! ſays Mr. Giles, what are you talking about!
<q>I diſlike extremely any <hi>intimate connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> betwixt this country and Britain, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding pecuniary advantages may ariſe from it<note n="†" place="bottom">See his ſpeech in this debate.</note>.</q>—So
ſays Citizen Adet, and ſo ſays every Frenchman as well as Mr. Giles. Yes; this is what they "diſlike," this is the thing, and the only thing, they are afraid of, and it is for that very reaſon that it ought to take place.</p>
               <p>But, I ſhould be glad to know on what Mr. Giles founds his "diſlike" to this connection, in caſe of a war. He acknowledges its "pecuniary advantages," and that is one great point gained; for you well know, Mr. Giles, that in <hi>connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:030227_0045_0FE54C2320C9C0C8"/>
with foreign nations</hi> nothing goes on cheerly <hi>without money.</hi> What, then, can be the objection? Becauſe America is a <hi>Republic</hi> and Britain a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy?</hi> This was the old objection to the treaty of amity and commerce with Great Britain; but it very luckily happened that, juſt before that treaty was concluded, the Republic of France had made a ſimilar treaty with the king of Pruſſia; and now, as if on purpoſe to give us a ſecond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, ſhe has concluded a treaty offenſive and defenſive with the king of Spain, and has called that nation her "<hi>natural</hi> allies."—Now, Mr. Giles, rub that <hi>forehead</hi> of yours a little, and tell me ſincerely, without any quibbling or ſubterfuge, whether you think the Spaniards are more <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> allied to the French than the Americans are to the Britiſh.</p>
               <p>Surely no nation was ever ſo completely duped as America has been by the French and their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizans! By a ſincere and hearty alliance with Great Britain, ſhe would not only place herſelf in a ſituation to make a peremptory demand of indemnification from France, but, in caſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal, would be able to ſtrip both France and Spain of every inch of territory they poſſeſs in this hemiſphere. There is no danger of any other nation taking umbrage at this. America and Great Britain might bid defiance to the world. The map of this continent and its iſlands lies open before them: they might cut and carve for themſelves, and ſit down in the quiet enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their conqueſts. The very mention of ſuch an alliance would ſcare the Dons at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of their mines, and would make the <hi>ſeven hundred and five tyrants</hi> tremble on their thrones. Yet the hirelings of France tell us that this alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:030227_0046_0FE54BA8EFD354F8"/>
muſt not be formed, becauſe, forſooth, Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain is a monarchy! Poor, paltry objection! France avails herſelf of all the raſcally aid ſhe can rake together; ſhe forms treaties with all the monarchies ſhe can find baſe enough to join her, and calls them her <hi>natural allies;</hi> but, if Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca makes a treaty with a monarchy, be it merely for the purpoſes of adjuſting diſputes and regulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing trade, France, "terrible France," takes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence at it, calls it an unnatural connection, ſeizes our veſſels as a puniſhment for it, and (with ſhame be it ſpoken!) is juſtified by ſome of thoſe who are choſen to preſerve the honour and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence of the country!—All the world are the <hi>natural allies</hi> of France; republics, ariſtocracies, monarchies and deſpotiſms; Dutch, Genoeſe, Spaniards, Turks and Devils; but poor America has no <hi>natural ally</hi> at all, except France herſelf; and if ſhe chooſes, with the aid of her allies, to rob and inſult her, America muſt accept of no one's aſſiſtance, but muſt ſtand and be pillaged and kicked till the by-ſtanders cry ſhame.—Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Independence! "Glorious Revolution." —If this muſt be the caſe, let us hear no more boaſtings and rejoicings. Let the <hi>fourth of July</hi> be changed from a feſtival to a faſt, or rather, let it be effaced for ever from the calendar.</p>

            <head>A LETTER TO THE INFAMOUS <hi>TOM PAINE,</hi> IN ANSWER TO HIS LETTER TO GENERAL WASHINGTON.</head>
            <p>
               <q>CEREMONY, and even <hi>ſilence,</hi> from what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever motive they may ariſe, have a hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful tendency, when they give the leaſt degree of countenance to <hi>baſe</hi> and <hi>wicked perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances.</hi>
               </q> With this maxim, Tom, you begin your remarks on one of your then Sovereign's ſpeeches to his parliament, and during which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks you pay a very high, though juſt, compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to the talents and virtues of <hi>General Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington;</hi> the very man whom you now attempt to ſtrip of every talent and every virtue, public as well as private. Complain not, therefore, if your max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im be adopted on the preſent occaſion; if your bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal

attack on this illuſtrious character has got the better of <hi>ſilence,</hi> and drawn forth an anſwer, and if this anſwer be conducted with very little <hi>ceremony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your letter profeſſes to treat of
<q>affairs public and private.</q>
From this adjunct to the title, we might have expected from the Great Tom Paine, the prince of demagogues, ſomething like a review of the Preſident's adminiſtration and a developement of diplomatic and cabinet ſecrets. It was not being over ſanguine to expect this much from a member of the "illuminated and illuminating Aſſembly of France," and a maker of conſtitutions beſides. But, alas! how have we been diſappointed! That part of your letter, which treats of what you call <hi>"public affairs,"</hi> is no more than a repetition of one or two paſſages of Citizen Adet's inſolent notes, which had been ſentenced to general execration a month before you letter appeared. Your <hi>"private affairs,"</hi> were long ago <hi>public.</hi> Every one knew, and every honeſt heart rejoiced, that you had found a Baſtile in the purlieus of your
<q>palace of <hi>freedom;</hi>
               </q>
that your filthy carcaſs was waſting in chains, inſtead of wallowing in the plunder you had promoted.</p>
            <p>In the minds of the people of this country, therefore, none of the aſſertions contained in your letter require to be refuted. The public voice has pronounced them as falſe and foul as the heart from which they proceeded. But, it is not enough that ſuch are our ſentiments; it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, to preſerve us from the ſhame of paſſing for your dupes, that theſe ſentiments ſhould be known: and, as the world has a right to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:030227_0049_0FE54C2CB31F3438"/>
of the reaſons on which they are founded, it is in compliance with that claim, and not in complaiſance to the inhabitant of a dungeon, that I proceed to obſerve on what you have had the impudence to aſſert: viz. 1. That our treaty with Britain juſtifies the ſeizure of our veſſels by the French. 2. That the Preſident was guilty of a neglect of duty, in not demanding your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement from the cells of one of the thouſand Baſtiles of your free and happy republic. 3. That our Federal conſtitution is an
<q>inconſiſtent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument,</q>
which, if you live to return to America, you will have altered. 4. That all which General Waſhington did in the American revolution, might have been done by any other man as well as by him, and that he has neither talents nor virtues, either as a ſtateſman or a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe aſſertions; to wit, <hi>That our treaty with Britain juſtifies the ſeizure of our veſſels by the French,</hi> you attempt to ſupport by a moſt barefaced miſconſtruction of the ſecond article of our treaty with France. This article ſays, that the contracting parties engage mutually, not to grant any particular <hi>favour</hi> to other nations, in reſpect to commerce and navigation, <hi>that ſhall not immediately become common to the other party.</hi>
               <q>Therefore, ſay you, all the <hi>conceſſions</hi> made to England by Jay's treaty, are, through the medium of this ſecond article, made to France, and can be exerciſed by her as a matter of right.</q>
This is a truth, but, like all the truths you have ever committed to paper, it is advanced with the malicious intention of leading your read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers into a falſehood.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:030227_0050_0FE54C2E46779FD8"/>Having ſaid, that all the commercial favours, or <hi>conceſſions,</hi> granted by America to England, are, by the pre-exiſting treaty, granted to France alſo (all which we knew while you were ſafe in your den), you proceed to number among thoſe <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions,</hi> the acknowledgment of Great Britain's right to ſeize contraband articles and enemies goods, found on board neutral veſſels, which is juſt <hi>no conceſſion at all.</hi> Great Britain had, prior to the treaty, as ſhe ſtill has, a right to ſeize all ſuch articles and enemies goods, ſo found. No ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a treaty was neceſſary to the recognition of this right. It is eſtabliſhed by the univerſal law of nations, and is, and ever has been, rigorouſly maintained, when not ſurrendered by particular convention. It could be no <hi>conceſſion</hi> on the part of America to acknowledge that Great Britain poſſeſſed a right which ſhe did poſſeſs, and which ſhe exerciſed too, before the treaty was formed; and if this was no <hi>conceſſion,</hi> how can the ſecond article of the treaty with France be in anywiſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to the caſe?</p>
            <p>I ſhall not here prove that the regulations, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting ſeizures, adopted in the treaty between Britain and America, are conſonant to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the modern law of nations, and are more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over ſanctioned by the practice of France. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall I enter into an explanation of the true meaning of the ſtipulation for <hi>equal favour,</hi> nor attempt to expoſe the abſurdity of applying it to what every independent nation enjoys as a <hi>right.</hi> All this I have done, and I hope to the ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every unprejudiced mind, in my anſwer to the inſolent and ſeditious Notes of Citizen Adet, to which I would refer you, Tom, were I not well aſſured, that you are guided by villainy, and not
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:030227_0051_0FE54C3084C64A40"/>
miſguided by ignorance or error. I ſhall not avail myſelf of the advantage to be derived from a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of theſe proofs. I ſhall admit your aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in its fulleſt extent, and convict you on your own words.</p>
            <p>You ſay, that the treaty with Britain, as far as it relates to ſeizures,
<q>is now become engrafted into that with France, and can be exerciſed by her as matter of right.</q>—Now, then, let us turn to what the Britiſh treaty ſays on this head.
<q>Where veſſels ſhall be captured or detained on <hi>juſt</hi> ſuſpicion of having on board <hi>enemies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,</hi> or of carrying <hi>to the enemy</hi> any of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles which are <hi>contraband of war;</hi> the ſaid veſſel ſhall be brought to the neareſt and moſt convenient port; and <hi>if any property of an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> ſhall be found on board of ſuch veſſel, that part <hi>only</hi> which <hi>belongs to the enemy</hi> ſhall be made prize, and the veſſel ſhall be at liberty to proceed with the remainder without any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment.</q>—Compare this with your juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the preſent conduct of the French. Are they content with ſeizing only articles <hi>contraband of war,</hi> or the <hi>property of enemies?</hi> And do they ſuffer the veſſel to proceed with the reſt of her cargo? No; they ſeize <hi>all vessels bound to the ports of the enemy,</hi> whether they have on board contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band articles, or enemies property, or not! They ſeize and confiſcate both veſſel and cargo, and put the captains and ſeamen in chains.</p>
            <p>You will ſay that Great Britain ſtopped all our veſſels bound to her enemy's ports, ſome of which ſhe alſo condemned; but this was before the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with her was made, and therefore cannot be
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:030227_0052_0FE54C3411795BB0"/>
attributed to that inſtrument, by which, on the contrary, ſhe acknowledges the <hi>illegality</hi> of all ſuch ſeizures, and engages <hi>to make full compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the losses thereby suſtained.</hi>—Take, then, the treaty with England, let it be the law to judge your Harlequin maſters by, and we ſhall ſoon have the pleaſure to hear that they have ſhared the fate they long ago merited, and which their <hi>servant</hi> has often ſo miraculouſly eſcaped.</p>
            <p>You were informed of the piratical orders they had iſſued, and were commanded to prepare a juſtification. In compliance with this command you rummaged about the treaty, as Milton rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maged the bible to find a juſtification for the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his king. Your baleful eyes at laſt fixed on the eighth article. Here, you ſay, the treaty
<q>makes a conceſſion to England of <hi>other arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> in American ſhips. <hi>These articles</hi> are <hi>all other articles,</hi> and none but an ignoramus, or ſomething worſe, would have put ſuch a phraſe into a treaty.</q>
Do you think that we have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read this treaty? And, if we had not, do you think there is a man among us fool enough to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that it contains ſuch a conceſſion? If you do, your opinion of the people of your
<q>belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed America</q>
muſt be much changed.</p>
            <p>This article, out of which you have culled <hi>two,</hi> and only <hi>two words,</hi> runs thus:
<q>And whereas the difficulty of agreeing on the <hi>precise cases</hi> in which <hi>alone</hi> proviſions and other articles, not generally contraband, <hi>may be regarded as such,</hi> renders it expedient to provide againſt the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtandings which might thence ariſe: It is agreed, that, whenever any ſuch articles, <hi>so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming contraband,</hi> according to the <hi>exiſting law
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:030227_0053_0FE54C371F85D300"/>
of nations,</hi> ſhall <hi>for that reason</hi> be ſeized, the ſame ſhall not be confiſcated, but the owners thereof ſhall be ſpeedily and completely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnified.</q>—So that, you ſee, your <hi>all other articles</hi> are reduced to ſuch articles only as are <hi>contraband of war,</hi> according to the modern, <hi>the exiſting law of nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Playfair</hi> calls you
<q>the clumſy advocate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,</q>
and you are certainly as clumſy an advocate of piracy. Poor Citizen Adet is a lame hand enough, but you are ſtill worſe; he did flounce about and made a noiſe before he ſunk; but you juſt make a bubble, and go to the bottom at once, like a ſtone or a lump of lead.</p>
            <p>I now come to your charge againſt the Preſident reſpecting your detention in priſon. You inſiſt that you were ſtill a citizen of America, and that therefore it was his duty to demand your enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.—You perceived that you had loſt all claim to citizenſhip here, in virtue of the article which extends that deprivation to all thoſe
<q>who ſhall accept of any title or <hi>office</hi> under any foreign king, prince, or <hi>ſtate.</hi>
               </q>
To get rid of this you have recourſe to a curious quibble: you pretend that this proviſion did not embrace your caſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe France, at the time you joined the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive mob was neither a kingdom, principality nor <hi>ſtate,</hi> but <hi>a people in a ſtate of revolution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That France was not worthy of the name of <hi>ſtate</hi> I am very ready to allow. The French were then, what they are now, a horde of ſavages, engaged in the work of deſtruction. But, be this as it might, France was acknowledged as a <hi>ſtate</hi> by America, and even you, I preſume, will not have
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:030227_0054_0FE54C38AD8E4310"/>
the impudence to deny, that ſhe was declared to be a republic too, the very firſt day that you took your ſeat in the convention, and, if a republic, ſhe was certainly a ſtate. Admitting your own doctrine, then, to have preſerved your claim to American citizenſhip, you ſhould have abdicated your ſeat, the inſtant this declaration took place.</p>
            <p>You contend that a man may lend a hand to <hi>form a conſtitution</hi> for a nation who has none, without forfeiting his citizenſhip in his own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. This may be ſo: it is nonſenſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not worth diſputing about. But why did you not retire as ſoon as your job was done. You continued your ſeat after you had made and ſworn to and made every one elſe ſwear to your ſilly work. You had taſted the ſweets of plunder, and you hung to it like a leech, till Robeſpierre chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you from a legiſlator to a jail-bird.</p>
            <p>You wiſh to perſuade us, that the being a dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate to aid in forming a conſtitution was not fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any <hi>office</hi> at all.—Now ſuppoſe that I ſhould allow this, did you exerciſe no other functions than thoſe of a conſtitution maker? Was not the convention every thing, legiſlative, executive and diplomatic; judicial, military and <hi>eccleſiaſtic?</hi> Were not ſome of you watching the armies, others ſuperintending the guillotine, and others preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſermons of atheiſm? Was this filling <hi>no office?</hi> And were you not at all times as liable and as ready and fit to be thus employed as any of the gang? Nay, did you not preſide <hi>as judge</hi> ("ah! righteous raſcally judge!") on the trial of Louis the XVIth? And did not your ſwiniſh voice pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce on him the ſentence of <hi>baniſhment?</hi> Was this filling <hi>no office?</hi>

               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:030227_0055_0FE54C3AC9FEAF70"/>But, whether you were an officer or not, or whether you had legally forfeited your American citizenſhip, what a poor mean-ſpirited miſcreant muſt you be to make a complaint that your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe was not requeſted by the Preſident, the man whom you call an <hi>apostate</hi> or an <hi>impostor!</hi> What! <hi>old Common Sense,</hi> who was at all times

            <p>Are you not aſhamed, Tom, to be ſurpaſſed by a lord? Inſtead of coming forth from your den, a volunteer martyr in this glorious cauſe, and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Vive la Republique!</hi> with your neck under the national razor, you tremble even now at the thoughts of your danger. Inſtead of dancing to the muſic of your republican chains, you pine and peak and cry for <hi>liberty:</hi> as if it were poſſible for a man to want liberty in France!</p>
            <p>I cannot help obſerving here how harmoniouſly you chime in with the cant of the enſlaved French and the American democrats.
<q>During the <hi>ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of Robespierre</hi>—the <hi>orders of Robespierre</hi>— the <hi>cruelty of Robespierre.</hi>
               </q>
Juſt as if the whole mob of tyrants, who paſſed the bloody decrees, were not as guilty as he who <hi>proposed</hi> them? But the reſt, or the greateſt part of them, are <hi>alive</hi> and <hi>in power,</hi> and Robeſpierre is <hi>dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You are obliged, however, to confeſs that the convention itſelf refuſed to releaſe you at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of ſome ſilly Americans: but here again, to avoid offending your deſpotic maſters, you throw the blame <hi>on the president</hi> for the time being, and he, poor cut-throat, "has ſince <hi>absconded.</hi>" If he had been preſent you would not have dared even to do this.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:030227_0057_0FE54C41D671BA40"/>The committees, you acknowledge, did order your arreſt; but then, as ſome of them are alive, and even on the throne, you add:
<q>the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees, of which <hi>Robeſpierre was Dictator.</hi>
               </q>
Thus you qualify your tone, kneel, creep and cringe to thoſe who have held you in chains, and brought you to the foot of the ſcaffold. Nay you do more. <hi>Carnot,</hi> one of the five fellows now called the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory, was a member of theſe committees, he was Robeſpierre's right-hand man, the jackall that brought proviſion for the guillotine. This is he who ſigns the decree for ſeizing the veſſels of your "beloved America," and this meaſure your pen, your poor old double-turned antitheſiſes, are now employed to defend. It is thus that you ſupport
"the <hi>dignity</hi> of <hi>man,</hi>" that "<hi>dignity</hi> compared to which that of lords, dukes and kings dwindles into nothingneſs."</p>
            <p>If Robeſpierre were ſtill living, you would be as much his flatterer and ſlave as you are the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer and ſlave of Carnot. You were made for a French republican; the baſeneſs which they have conſtantly diſcovered, is in your nature. While the tyrant is alive, he is a God; when dead, he is a devil. An ignominious death, the awful avenger of crimes, and, with other men, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion of injuries, with you unlocks the faculties of reproach, and changes your praiſes into exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations. You are like tame carrion-crows: you flutter in flocks from the preſence of the kite, but when he is wounded by the hunter and lies gaſping on the earth, you attack his proſtrate car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſs, and pick out his eyes that are cloſing in death.</p>

            <p>There is a pretty little poſey for you, Thomas! What a vile wretch muſt you be! That which was becoming the
<q>admiration and model of the world,</q>
is now
<q>
                  <hi>a copy,</hi> not <hi>quite ſo baſe</hi> as the original, of <hi>the Britiſh government;</hi>
               </q>
and you were exhauſting all the hell of ſophiſtry to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade the Engliſh to change their conſtitution for another, from which the vices of their own were <hi>"naturally to be expected."</hi>—Never, ſurely never, was a poor demagogue ſo completely detected. Your letter will do good in this country; but in England it will be a national bleſſing. Your <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity</hi> will now be ſeen to the bottom. Thoſe whom you had the addreſs to deceive will now bluſh at their folly: they will ſee the pit you had prepared for them, and will bleſs the hand that ſaved them from deſtruction. For my own part, what I owe to this performance in common with every American and every Engliſhman, I have particular acknowledgments to make. It has flattered my vanity as a political writer; a ſpecies
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:030227_0060_0FE54C4AB4CDAB70"/>
of vanity which you know, Tom, is none of the weakeſt,—witneſs your Second Part of the
<q>Rights of Man.</q>
I long ago declared that all who were the enemies
<q>of the Britiſh Government, would be found to be the enemies of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Government of America.</q>
And no longer ſince than the September Cenſor, which contains your infamous life, I ſaid:
<q>I ſincerely believe that he (meaning you, Tom,) <hi>hated,</hi> and that he <hi>ſtill hates,</hi> the <hi>general government of the United States,</hi> as much as the <hi>Government of Great Britain.</hi> But it was neceſſary that he ſhould find out ſomething to hold up to the imitation of the Engliſh; no matter what, ſo that it differed from what they poſſeſſed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Among the good effects that your letter will have, one is, and that not of the leaſt importance, it will tend to complete the reconciliation between America and Britain. Your intention and that of your employers was quite different; but you have overſtepped your mark. When the people of this country firſt read your "Rights of Man," they were naturally flattered with your compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to their wiſdom. To have formed a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<q>the admiration and model of the world,</q>
and to be held up to the imitation of their rivals in freedom, merited a return of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe; and they were aſtoniſhed and offended to find, that the Engliſh refuſed to be inſtructed. Hence the appellations of "Britiſh tyrant," and "willing ſlaves;" and all the acrimonious and diſdainful language that was for a long time held towards that nation. But now, when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that their flatterer is become an aſſailant, and that their
<q>admiration and model of the world,</q>
is no more than a mere
<q>
                  <hi>copy,</hi> not
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030227_0061_0FE54C4D1A734168"/>

               </q>
they will begin to think that the people of England were not ſo fooliſh; that they ſtill are free men, and worthy of their friendſhip and affection.</p>
            <p>In a ſucceſſive attack on all that is fair and excellent, <hi>the conduct and character of General Waſhington</hi> naturally follows the Federal Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
            <p>I will not caſt a ſlur on this illuſtrious man by attempting to defend him againſt the ſhafts of Tom Paine, but I will make you, Tom, defend him againſt yourſelf.</p>

            <p>Now, atrocious, infamous miſcreant,
<q>look on this picture, and on this.</q>
I would call on you to bluſh, but the ruſt of villainy has eaten your cheek to the bone, and dried up the ſource of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. Are theſe the proofs of your diſintereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs and conſiſtency? In it thus that you are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the ſame, and that you
<q>
                  <hi>preſerve through life</hi> the right-angled character of MAN?</q>
            </p>
            <p>The object of your maſters, in having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to you on this occaſion, is evident to every one. Your letter was written at the time they were paſſing the decree for authorizing the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their treaty with America. To prevent the people here from reſenting the injury, it was neceſſary to perſuade them that it was owing
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030227_0064_0FE54C55EC228DB0"/>
to the mal-adminiſtration of their own govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and this could not be done without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the character of him who preſided over it. It was thought that you yet poſſeſſed influence enough to effect this, and therefore the proſtituted pen of the revolutionary ruffian was put in a ſtate of requiſition.</p>
            <p>Your tyrants are completely baffled. The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of your letter are exactly the contrary to what it was intended to produce. There is but one thing on earth nearer to the hearts of all true Americans than their conſtitution, and that is, the ſpotleſs character of their chief. Your brutal attempt to blacken this character was all that was wanted to crown his honour and your infamy. You never before ſunk to a level with the damned, but now you are plunged beneath them. The vile democrats, nay even Franklin Bache, with whom you boaſt of being in cloſe correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, can ſay not a word in its defence. All the <hi>apology</hi> for you, is, that you wrote at the inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the deſpots of Paris. Thus the great Rights of Man, the ſworn foe of corruption, and the reformer of nations, winds up his patriotic ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer: his being <hi>bribed</hi> is pleaded as an <hi>alleviation of his crimes.</hi>

            <head>PROPOSALS, <hi>By William Cobbett, Book-Seller, of Philadelphia,</hi> FOR PUBLISHING <hi>A NEWS-PAPER,</hi> TO BE ENTITLED, Porcupine's Gazette AND DAILY ADVERTISER.</head>
            <p>METHINKS I hear the reader exclaim:
<q>What! have we not Gazettes enough al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready?</q>
Yes, and far too many: but thoſe that we have, are, in general, conducted in ſuch a manner that their great number, inſtead of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering mine unneceſſary, is the only cauſe that calls for its eſtabliſhment.</p>
            <p>The gazettes in this country have done it more real injury than all its open enemies ever did or can do. They miſlead the people at home and miſrepreſent them abroad. It was theſe vehicles of ſedition and diſcord that encouraged the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the <hi>Weſt</hi> to rebel; it was they that gave riſe to the depredations of Britain, by exciting the people to ſuch acts of violence againſt that nation, as left her no room to doubt that we were deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined on war; and it was they, when an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation had been happily effected, that ſtirred up an oppoſition to it ſuch as has ſeldom been witneſſed, and which was overcome by mere chance. Theſe gazettes it was, that, by miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the diſpoſitions of the people, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged the French to proceed from one degree of
<pb facs="unknown:030227_0066_0FE54C5A5DF2E2A8"/>
inſolence to another, till at laſt their miniſter braves the Preſident in his chair, and a bullying commander comes and tells us that his only bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs is to ſeize our veſſels, in violation of a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by virtue of which alone he claims a right to enter our ports: and it is theſe gazettes that now have the impudence to defend what their falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and malice have produced.</p>
            <p>I ſhall be told, that the people are to blame; that they are not obliged to read theſe abominable publications. But they <hi>do read</hi> them; and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands who read them, read nothing elſe. To ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them is impoſſible; they will vomit forth their poiſon; it is a privilege of their natures, that no law can abridge; and therefore the only mode left, is, to counteract its effects.</p>
            <p>This muſt be done, too, in their own way. Books, or periodical publications in the form of books, may be of ſome ſervice, but are by no means a match for their flying folios. A falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood that remains uncontradicted for a month, begins to be looked upon as a truth, and when the detection at laſt makes its appearance, it is often as uſeleſs as that of the doctor who finds his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient expired.</p>
            <p>The only method of oppoſition, then, is to meet them on their own ground; to ſet foot to foot; diſpute every inch and every hair's breadth; fight them at their own weapons, and return them two blows for one.</p>
            <p>A gazette of this ſtamp is what I have long wiſhed to ſee, but I have wiſhed and expected it in vain. Indignation at the ſupineneſs of others
<pb facs="unknown:030227_0067_0FE54C5C85CFDE88"/>
has at laſt got the better of all diffidence in my own capacity, and has determined me to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the taſk.</p>
