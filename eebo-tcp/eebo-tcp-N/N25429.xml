            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>THE ſucceſs which my former narrative met with, which was merely an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from a Journal kept for my own amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, has induced me to lay before the public a more copious detail of that work.</p>
                  <p>Various errors in the former edition are in this corrected,—and large additions made, with ſuch improvements as muſt render the work more extenſively uſeful, as well as entertaining to readers of all claſſes. I have been more particular in the Geographical deſcription of the ſeveral places, in this edition than I was in the laſt, particularly of Algiers and Oran.</p>
                  <p>The importance as well as utility of having a work of this kind generally diſſeminated through the United States, muſt be apparent to every thinking perſon. The ſuffering of our fellow-citizens, in Algiers were great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed! They ought not to be too eaſily forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="unknown:033747_0003_0FF915EB47927A00"/>
Every ſtep to avoid a repetition of them will undoubtedly be purſued. But ſhould, at any future period, from cauſes not ſeen, more Americans be doomed to wear the galling chain, (God grant that period may never ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive) a knowledge of the habits, manners, and cuſtoms of the place, may not be unſerviceable.</p>
                  <p>From the tender and feeling ſoul, a peruſal of the following pages, muſt call forth the tear of ſympathy. The hardſhips—the ſufferings—the agonizing tortures, which our fellow-citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens had to endure, while groaning under all the horrors of Mahometan vaſſalage, of Alge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine tyranny, muſt call into action every ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſigh! and virgin drops of pity embalm the memory of thoſe whoſe fate it was to ſink un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the weight of their accumulated woes.—Alas! they're gone—</p>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Nor heed they, more with anguiſh and with pain,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>The goad terrific—or the galling chain.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <p>Some of my deſcriptions of the treatment of the Captives may appear rather wire-drawn, but then my readers ought to be informed that theſe mercileſs Barbarians are taught by their
<pb facs="unknown:033747_0004_0FF915F2A5FE7890"/>
religion to treat the Chriſtian Captives with unexampled cruelty, and that in ſo doing they do God ſervice! Hence to expect pity or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration from thoſe ſons of Iſhmael would be as abſurd, as to expect a ſhrubery from the burning deſerts, or cooling ſtreams from the parched plains of Arabia.</p>
                  <p>All the poor, forlorn, miſerable Captive has to do, is to reſign himſelf up to his fate, and in ſilence wait the event.</p>
                  <p>As the following is the production of one whoſe literary advantages have been but ſmall and whoſe opportunities of improvement have been limited, he humbly hopes, the humane &amp; candid reader will paſs over ſuch errors as may not have been diſcovered: And further hopes that their patronage may be afforded to the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venile efforts of one, who for a long time, had to ſuffer the galling chains of Slavery.</p>
                  <p>As ſome may inquire what opportunities could be obtained for writing a journal under ſuch ſevere captivity; I would here obſerve that I wrote in the night, while in the <hi>Bagnio</hi> or priſon, after our daily labour was over, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal events of the day, merely to amuse &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb facs="unknown:033747_0005_0FF915FA6EAFF720"/>
my mind from the diſmal reflections which naturally occurred—that I could have no inducement to exaggerate our ſufferings not ſuppoſing my narrative would ever be ſeen here—theſe circumſtances being known, I flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter myſelf the facts herein ſtated will not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten be called in queſtion.—</p>
                  <p>But ſhould the truth of any thing ſtated in the following pages be called in queſtion, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple teſtimony can be procured in ſupport of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing here advanced, from thoſe of my unfortunate fellow captives whoſe veracity is known and unqueſtionable.</p>
                  <p>Sincerely wiſhing that none of my fellow-citizens may ever be ſo unhappy as to experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the miſeries of Algerine ſlavery, I again commend the following pages, to their candour and patronage.</p>

                     <p>ON Saturday the 27th of July 1793, I ſailed from Newburyport in the State of Maſſachuſetts, in the capacity of a Mariner, on board the Brig Polly, belonging to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove mentioned place, Samuel E. Bayley, Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, bound to Baltimore, in the State of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryland, expecting to take freight from thence for the Iſland of Tobago.</p>
                     <p>On Tueſday the 6th of Auguſt, we were brought too by a French privateer, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted immediately to proceed on our voyage. Being then in ſight of the Capes of Virginia, we took on board a Pilot and ſtood in for the Cheſapeak.</p>
                     <p>Wedneſday the 7th of Auguſt, we entered the Capes and were 'till Saturday the 10th, before we arrived at Baltimore; and found,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:033747_0007_0FF91604219D9358"/>
on our arrival, that the freight, which Capt. Bayley expected, was embarked and ſailed on board another veſſel. Nothing particular hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, until Monday the 19th when we were ordered by the Captain to diſcharge the ballaſt, and were informed by him that he had agreed to take a freight for Cadiz.</p>
                     <p>Thurſday the 29th, <hi>Paul Noyes,</hi> one of our mariners, was attacked with a ſevere fever, and continued on board until Monday, the 9th of September, when he was carried on ſhore, and put under the care of a woman, well qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ified for attending ſick people. I underſtand he died in a few days after our departure.—Tueſday the 10th we ſailed from Baltimore, bound to Cadiz; and on Friday the 13th we left ſight of the Capes of Virginia. Nothing of any great moment occurred, until Thurſday the 24th of October, when we fell in with and ſpoke two Brigs from Elſinore, bound to Barcelona. On Friday, the 25th, early in the morning we ſaw the ſame Brigs about two miles to windward, ſtanding on their larboard tack, with the wind about E. N. E.</p>
                     <p>We got our breakfaſt, and ate it in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt jollity, not apprehending any danger nigh, expecting to reach the port of deſtination within 48 hours; As we judged ourſelves to be about 35 leagues weſtward of Cape St. Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. But what a fatal day was this! How viſionary our hopes! Our ſprightly looks, and cheerful congratulations, and anticipations of reaching the port of our deſtination was ſoon
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:033747_0008_0FF9160BD7CB0C98"/>
turned into the moſt gloomy deſpair. Little did we think in the morning when we aroſe with nothing before us but Liberty and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that before the Sun ſhould reach his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian altitude, we ſhould be ſlaves to merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>Barbarians.</hi> This however, was the caſe, For at 9 A. M. we ſaw a ſtrange ſail bearing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout E. N. E. and ſtanding directly for the two Daniſh Brigs. We then diſcovered (with a proſpect Glaſs) that ſhe had boarded them; and that ſhe had the Engliſh Flag diſplayed at her peak. We then ſuppoſed her to be an Engliſh Privateer. She ſoon diſmiſſed them, and bore down upon us. By this time we could ſee that ſhe was a Brig; and diſcerned by the cut of her ſails, that ſhe was not an Engliſh veſſel, although ſhe had ſtill the Engliſh ſlag flying; we then ſuppoſed her to be a French Privateer, hoiſting the Engliſh flag to deceive their enemy. We immediately clued down topgallant ſails, and hove too in order to wait 'till ſhe came along ſide. When ſhe came near enough to make us hear, ſhe hailed us in Engliſh, aſked from whence we came, and where bound; which was immediately anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered by Capt. Bayley. The man who hailed us, was dreſſed in the Chriſtian habit, and was the only perſon we could yet ſee on her deck; By this time, the Brig was under our ſtern; we then ſaw ſeveral men jump upon her poop, to hall aft the main ſheet, and ſaw by their dreſs and long beards that they were Moors, or Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerines. Our feelings at this unwelcome
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:033747_0009_0FF9161327659240"/>
ſight, are more eaſily imagined than deſcribed. What dreadful perturbations! to eſcape was impoſſible; weapons of defence, we had none, we muſt therefore reſign ourſelves to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of piratical ſea-rovers. She then hove too under our lee, when we heard a moſt terrible ſhouting, clapping of hands, huzzaing &amp;c.—And ſaw a great number of men riſe up with their heads above the gunnel, dreſſed in the Turkiſh habit like them we ſaw on the poop. They immediately hoiſted out a large launch, and about one hundred of the pirates jumped on board, all armed; ſome with Scymitres and Piſtols, others with pikes, ſpears, lances, knives, &amp;c. They manned about 20 oars and rowed along ſide. As ſoon as they came on board our veſſel, they made ſigns for us all to go forward, aſſuring us in ſeveral languages, that if we did not obey their commands, they would immediately maſſacre us all. They then went below into the cabin, ſteerage, and every place where they could get below deck, and broke open all the Trunks, and Cheſts, there were on board, and plundered all our bedding, cloathing, books, Charts, Quadrants, and every moveable article, that did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of the Cargo, or furniture. They then came on deck, like a parcel of ravenous wolves and ſtripped the cloaths off our backs, all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a ſhirt and pair of drawers, (myſelf being left with no ſhirt at all.) The next day an old Turk, with an air of kindneſs, gave me an old ſhirt without ſleeves, blaming thoſe who had
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:033747_0010_0FF91616AA5DB400"/>
taken mine from me. It was ſoothing to find a ſpark of humanity in my barbarous masters, who had but the day before mancipated and ſtripped us. This was the only Mahometan I ever met with, in whom I had the leaſt reaſon to ſuppoſe the ſmalleſt ſpark of humanity was kindled.</p>
                     <p>They having choſen a ſufficient number of the Algerines to take command of the prize, they ordered us all into the launch; and when they were all embarked, they rowed along ſide their own veſſel, and ordered us on board. We embarked accordingly, and were conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſome of the ſea rovers to the door of the poop, at which place we were received by a negro man, who conducted us into the cabin: when we entered the cabin, we ſaw the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the pirates, ſitting upon a matt on the cabin floor; who, with the help of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, aſked us many queſtions concerning the veſſel and cargo, the places of our nativity, and many others, as void of ſenſe as he was of Philanthrophy who asked them. He then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed us that he was an Algerine, that his veſſel belonged to Algiers, that her name was <hi>Babazera,</hi> and his name <hi>Rais Hudga Mahomet Salamia,</hi> and we were his priſoners; and muſt immediately experience the moſt abject ſlavery, on our arrival at Algiers, which we ſoon found to be true. Our embarraſſments were ſtill greater, when we found that they were Alge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines, (for before we ſuppoſed them to be Moors) knowing that the Algerines uſed the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:033747_0011_0FF9162181A3E048"/>
moſt ſeverity towards chriſtian captives, of any ſtate in all Barbary. He then informed us that Charles Logie, <abbr>Eſq.</abbr> Britiſh Consul at Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers, had negociated with the Dey for a truce with the Portugueſe, for the term of twelve months, and before that time would expire, they would have a firm peace, and the Alge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines could cruiſe in the Atlantic when they thought proper. He then told us we muſt do our duty as ſeamen on board his veſſel; we told him we had no clothes, his people having taken every thing away from us except what he ſaw on our backs, which was not ſufficient for us to ſtand the deck with. He anſwered in very abuſive words, that we might think ourſelves well uſed, that they did not take them. And he would teach us to work naked, adding "now you are ſlaves and muſt be treated as ſuch, and do not think that you will be trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted worſe than you really deſerve, for your bigotry and ſuperſtition, in believing in a man who was crucified by the Jews, and diſregar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the true doctrine of God's laſt and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt prophet, Mahomet." He then ordered us immediately to our duty. When we came out of the cabin, we ſaw the Polly juſt making ſail, and ſtanding after us, and that night we loſt ſight of her, and ſaw her no more until our arrival at Algiers.</p>
                     <p>About ſunſet they brought us a diſh of oil, olives, vinegar and ſome bread, and told us to eat heartily while we were on board, for after our arrival at Algiers, we ſhould not be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:033747_0012_0FF91628698AC018"/>
ſuch dainties. Although we were very hungry, we could eat but very little, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſituation we were in, and not being u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſuch diet.</p>
                     <p>When we ſat down to eat, we were accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by three Dutchmen, whom we had not ſcen before. On aſking them the particulars of their being on board, they informed us that they ſailed from Amſterdam, bound to Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga, three weeks before, on board the ſhip Hope belonging to New-York, commanded by John Burnham, and had been captured by an Alge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine frigate, within ten leagues of Gibraltar. And the frigate having taken ſeveral veſſels, and having a great number of Chriſtian cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives on board, the Capt. of the frigate being fearful leſt they ſhould make an attempt to riſe upon the veſſel, had diſtributed them on board the other Corſairs, which had not taken any prizes. After we had finiſhed our ſupper they divided us (12 in number) into two wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and ordered us to ſtand the deck, in our reſpective watches. It fell to my lot to have the firſt watch below, and as we went down they ordered us into the ſail-room to ſleep, and ſhewed us the door. We were obliged to creep in, upon our hands and knees, and ſtow ourſelves upon the ſails, in the beſt manner we could. We endeavoured to get a little ſleep, but could not, as our minds were filled with horror, and dreadful apprehenſions of the fate we might experience, and expecting addition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſeverity on our arrival at Algiers. We lay
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:033747_0013_0FF9162F28E38398"/>
in this unhappy condition, bemoaning our hapleſs fate, until we ſuppoſed it to be paſt mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, and could not conceive the reaſon that the watch was not relieved, as is cuſtomary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Americans and Engliſh. And being ſtrangers to their manner of relieving the watch, ſuppoſed we had (innocently) neglected our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; this made us very uneaſy, fearing the watch had been relieved, and we not knowing it, they would inflict ſome corporal puniſhment, I then propoſed to my fellow ſufferers, that I would go on deck, in order to know whether they had called the watch or not; but they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed me not to go, adding, that if the watch was not called, they might treat me very ill for appearing on deck in the night, when my duty did not call me there, we then determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to wait 'till we were called, and to bear patiently our puniſhment if they inflicted any. We waited in this ſuſpence for near an hour longer, when I reſolved to go on deck by my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and know the iſſue: With this reſolution, I crept upon my hands and knees to the ſail room door, and on my appearance at the door, a Turk came to me, armed with a Scymitar &amp; a pair of Piſtols, and made me to underſtand by ſigns, that he wanted to know where I was going, I anſwered him in the ſame manner, made him underſtand that neceſſity called me on deck. He then conducted me to the hatchway, and ſpoke to ſome perſon on the deck, in his own language, which I could not underſtand, and pointing with his ſinger, I found that I had
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:033747_0014_0FF9163881EA5B40"/>
permiſſion to go up. I accordingly went on deck, and was received by another Turk, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the ſame manner, he asked me, in the French language, if I wiſhed to go in the head, which I anſwered in the affirmative: as I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood ſome French, and could hold a tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſcourſe with him, I aſked him if the watch was called, which he anſwered in the negative, and on aſking him if it was not paſt twelve o'clock, he told me it was paſt two.</p>
                     <p>On enquiring the manner of their ſtanding a watch, he informed me that they kept ten hours for one watch; and that it commenced at 8 o'clock in the evening and continued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til 6 in the morning; then relieved and kept till 4 in the afternoon, and their dog-watch was from 4 in the afternoon till 8, having only three watches in 24 hours. I then went below and informed my fellow-ſufferers of what had paned, which gave them great ſatisfaction to think we had not committed an innocent of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, as before we feared we had done. We were happy in being freed from the terrors of puniſhment. We then made ourſelves as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy and comfortable as we could, conſidering the deplorable ſituation we were in. But could not ſleep any the remainder of the night, for by this time the vermin, ſuch as lice, bugs and fleas, had found their way to our apartment, and in ſuch quantities that it ſeemed as if we were entirely covered with thoſe unwelcome gueſts. However, we paſſed the remainder of the night, in condoling our miſerable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:033747_0015_0FF8C4D2320D9170"/>
and rubbing thoſe vermin from our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, in the beſt manner we could. At 6, A. M. we were ſurpriſed by three heavy knocks from the deck, and with ſuch force, that it ſeemed as if they endeavoured to knock the deck to pieces, and not hearing any thing ſaid, we could not imagine the meaning: We lay a few minutes, and were then called by a Turk, ordered on deck and informed, that that was their way of calling the watch. This office is generally performed by the boatſwain, or one of his mates, in the following manner: A large block is laid on the deck near the hatchway, and ſtruck upon with a very large beetle, which makes ſuch a horrid noiſe, as nearly ſufficient to ſtun the brain of a ſtrong headed perſon, and this was the cauſe of our ſurpriſe before mentioned. This being Saturday the 26th of October. We paſſed the rock of Gibraltar on Monday the 28th and nothing of any conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence happened on our paſſage to Algiers; ſpoke ſeveral veſſels, but none proved to be their enemies. We having a very freſh breeze from the weſtward, we arrived at Algiers on Friday the firſt of November.</p>
                     <p>After they had brought their veſſel to an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor in the roads, they hoiſted out their boats and ordered us to embark, and to lay ourſelves down in the bottom of the boat: Having o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed their commands, we were rowed on ſhore, and landed, amidſt the ſhouts and huz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zas of thouſands of malicious barbarians. We were conducted to the Dey's palace by a guard,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:033747_0016_0FF9163F77A5F4D8"/>
and as we paſſed through the ſtreets, our ears were ſtunned with ſhouts, clapping of hands and other acclamations of joy from the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants; thanking God for their great ſucceſs and victories over ſo many Chriſtian dogs and unbelievers, the appellation they generally give to all Chriſtians. On our arrival at the gates of the Palace, we were received by another Guard, &amp; conducted before the Dey, who after taking a view of us, told us he had ſent ſeveral to our government, entreating them to negociate with him for a peace, and had never received any ſatisfactory anſwer from them: That he was determined never to make a peace with the United States, in his reign, as they had ſo often neglected his requeſts, and treated him with diſdain, adding "now I have got you, you christian dogs, you ſhall eat ſtones." He then picked out four boys to wait upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the palace, as follows, Benjamin Church, Benjamin Ober, Charles Smith and John Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey, and then ordered the reſt of us to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to the priſon <hi>Bili<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>After condoling our hapleſs fate, for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiderable time; a French prieſt came to us and enquired, if any among us underſtood the French language, and was anſwered in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative. After converſing ſometime with the perſon who ſpoke French, he left us, and told us he ſhould return in a few minutes.—About half an hour afterwards he returned, and two Moors with him, who brought two baſkets full of white bread, and he gave each man a loaf, weighing nearly a pound, which was a very delicious meal for us, we having eaten nothing during the day, it now being about 4 o'clock in the afternoon. He likewiſe inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us that it was a cuſtom among thoſe ſons, of rapine and plunder, not to allow the ſlaves any kind of food on the firſt day of their land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, except one ſmall loaf of bread at night—And what we then received, he gave us, out of his own pocket, and ſaid if he was able, his charity would further extend. We thanked our kind benefactor, and he then took his leave of us. We then walked from one part of the <hi>Bagnio</hi> to another, not knowing in what part we might be allowed to remain. We wandered in this manner, bemoaning our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable ſituation, 'till about 5 o'clock, when we ſaw (according to the beſt our judgment) about 600 men enter the <hi>Bagnio,</hi> all appearing to be in a more miserable condition than our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:033747_0018_0FF91652148A3D60"/>
with wretched habits, dejected counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and chains on their legs, every part of them beſpeaking unutterable diſtreſs. I enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the priſon-keeper, who thoſe people were, and of what crimes they had been guilty, that they were loaded with ſuch heavy chains. I was anſwered, that they were chriſtian ſlaves, had been captured in the ſame manner as my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſeeking an honeſt livelihood: A few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes afterwards, we heard a man ſhouting out in a moſt terrible manner, and not underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his language, made it ſound more terrible. We were immediately informed by a man who underſtood the Engliſh Language, that all us (Americans) muſt appear in the third gallery. We made all haſte up we poſſibly could, and as we entered the gallery we paſſed one at a time through a narrow door, on one ſide of which ſtood a taſk-maſter, and on the other ſide a Chriſtian ſlave. The former had a large ſtick in his hand, and the latter a book, in which was written the names of all the chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an captives in that priſon. The chriſtian aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed each man his name, and then wrote it in the book, and as we paſſed, the Turk gave each man a ſmall bundle. On examining it, we found it contained a blanket, a <hi>capoot</hi> (which is a ſort of jacket with a head) a waiſtcoat, made ſomething like a frock, to draw over the head, it not being open at the belly, a ſhirt, with neither collar or wriſtbands, a pair of trowſers, made ſomewhat like a woman's pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticoat, (with this difference,) the bottom being
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:033747_0019_0FF9165BE55718E8"/>
ſewed up, and two holes to put the legs thro' and a pair of ſlippers. There was neither but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, or button-hole on the whole ſuit. Such a ſuit excepting the blanket, of which they never get but one, is given to each captive once a year. The day they receive this ſuit is on Friday enſuing Chriſtmas. Soon after we received the above mentioned bundle, we were again called into the third gallery, and paſſed in the ſame manner as before, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our names called ſeparately by the clerk, we paſſed the taſk-maſter, and received each man a ſmall loaf of very black, ſour bread weighing about three ounces and a half, which we ate, although it was not ſo delicious as the bread we received from the French Prieſt.—Having finiſhed our ſupper, we lay down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſtone floor, and went to ſleep, and made ourſelves as comfortable, as we could, having neither bed, nor bedding, except the blanket before mentioned; but being very much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigued, we ſlept tolerably well until about 3 o'clock, when were alarmed with a terrible ſhouting, as before, and were all ordered to go down into the lower part of the priſon.—When we arrived there, they put a chain on each mans leg, reaching up to the ſhoulder, and weighing about 25, or 30lb. this was our firſt nights lodging in this doleful manſion of horror and deſpair. This done, it now being day-break—Saturday the 2d of November, we were all driven out of the <hi>Bagnio,</hi> and from thence to the Marine, where I experienced the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:033747_0020_0FF9165FE96A5B20"/>
hardeſt days work, I ever underwent before.—The dreadful clanking of the chains, was the moſt terrible noiſe I ever heard. And never during my whole captivity did I feel ſuch hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of mind, as on this dreadful morning.</p>

As it is not in my power to write the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of each day of my captivity, (which would be too tedious to my readers,) I only intend to give you a ſhort narrative of ſome of the moſt particular occurrences, which happened while I was in this abject ſlavery, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon labor, and uſage of the ſlaves, which is as follows.</p>
                     <p>At day break, in the morning, the priſon-keeper calls all the ſlaves out to go to work; at the door of the <hi>Bagnio,</hi> they are met by the <hi>Guardians</hi> or taſk-maſters (who have their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from the <hi>Guardian Bachi;</hi> he is the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of all the ſlaves that belong to the regency) they are then conducted to whatever place he has directed. The greateſt part of their work, is blowing rocks in the mountains. While ſome are drilling the holes, others are digging the earth from off thoſe rocks, which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, and others carrying away the dirt in baſkets. When the rocks are blown, they take ſuch as will anſwer their purpoſe: (Rocks leſs than 20 Tons weight, will not ſerve.)—Many are hauled by the ſlaves, two miles diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which weigh 40 tons. They roll them to the bottom of the mountain, where is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient place to put them on a ſled. Here they are left until Friday, (which is the Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Sabbath, on which day all the Chriſtian ſlaves belonging to the Regency, are driven out to haul them to the Quay, which is about two miles from the place where they are loaded.—In order to haul theſe rocks, they place them
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:033747_0022_0FF9166AD5099308"/>
upon a ſled made of large ſquare timber, and after being ſufficiently ſecured with ropes, they put about ſix or ſeven hundred men to each ſled, who haul it with ropes about ſeven inches in circumference, and as the road is all paved with large flat ſtones, they make ſome progreſs in the buſineſs. When riſing an aſcent, ſhould the number who are at one ſled, not be able to haul it up, they are aſſiſted by the reſt. By this means, they are enabled to haul three, or four rocks in a day, upon each ſled. From this Quay, they are taken on board a <hi>Puntoon</hi> (which is a large flat bottomed kind of veſſel) and diſcharged at the back of the mole, with the help of wheels. Theſe rocks are laid there in order to break off the ſea, that the mole may not waſh away; which muſt have a continual ſupply, for every gale of wind that comes waſhes them into deep water. After a gale they have as much need of them as they had the firſt hour after the mole was built. So we may conclude this is a work that will never be finiſhed. On Friday when the ſlaves, are going to work in the mountains, they paſs out thro' the gates of the city, about day break in the morning, and arrive at the bottom of the mountain, ſometime before ſunriſe.—On their arrival there, they are divided by the taſk-maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, into different gangs, each gang has one ſled. They muſt haul as many in a day as the taſk-maſters think proper, and are treated with additional rigor and ſeverity on this day. For the drivers being anxious to have as many haul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:033747_0023_0FF916721A1B9030"/>
as poſſible, (becauſe the number they haul muſt be reported to the Dey,)—they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinully beating the ſlaves with their ſticks, &amp; goading them with its end, in which is a ſmall ſpear, not unlike an ox-goad, among our farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
                     <p>If any one chance to faint, and fall down with fatigue, they generally beat them until they are able to riſe again.</p>
                     <p>At night when they are done hauling, all hands are called together, and have their names called by the clerk, and every one muſt paſs the <hi>Guardian Bachi,</hi> as his name is called.—Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are done calling, and find that none are miſſing, they are driven by the taſk-maſters into the city, then left to go to the <hi>Bagnio</hi> by themſelves, and muſt appear there within half an hour after they enter the gates of the city.</p>
                     <p>The roll is called every night in the priſon, a few minutes before the gates are locked.—If any one neglects his call, he is immediately put into irons, hands and feet, then chained to a pillar, where he muſt remain until the next morning. Then the irons are taken from his feet, and he is driven before a task-maſter, to the marine, and the <hi>Viguilhadge,</hi> (who is the miniſter of the marine) orders what puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he thinksproper, which is immediately inflicted by the taſk-maſters.</p>
                     <p>He commonly orders 150, or 200 Baſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does.</p>
                     <p>The manner of inflicting this puniſhment is as follows: The perſon is laid upon his face,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:033747_0024_0FF915D6B0EE7570"/>
with his hands in irons behind him, and his legs laſhed together with a rope.—One taſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter holds down his head and another his legs, while two others inflict the puniſhment upon his breech, with ſticks ſome what larger than an ox-goad. After he has received one half his puniſhment in this manner, they laſh his ancles to a pole, and two Turks lift the pole up, and hold it in ſuch a manner, as brings the ſoles of his feet upward, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of his puniſhment, he receives upon the ſoles of his feet. Then he is releaſed from his bands, and obliged to go directly to work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt of his fellow-ſlaves. On other days of the week only a part of the ſlaves work in the mountains, &amp; the others in the marine, thoſe in the marine, are again divided into diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent companies, each company have different kinds of employ. Some are employed in careen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the corſairs, and ſitting them for ſea. At other times they are ſtripping them and haul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them up. Others are diſcharging their prizes, cleaning the harbor, and bringing thoſe large rocks, before mentioned to the mole and every article that is tranſported from one part of the marine to another, or from the marine to the city, or from the city to the marine, or elſewhere, muſt be carried by the ſlaves, with poles, upon their ſhoulders. For the ſtreets are ſo narrow, that no kind of a carriage is uſed here, not even a wheelbarrow. In many ſtreets it is difficult for one man to paſs another.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="26" facs="unknown:033747_0025_0FF9167C2162FB58"/>
When their prizes are diſcharged, their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go muſt be all carried into the city, and ſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in magazines, ſo that ſome part of the ſlaves are conſtantly carrying hogsheads of ſugar, pipes of wine, caſks of nails, cannon, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>They work from day break in the morning, until a certain hour in the afternoon, which they call <hi>Laza,</hi> which is juſt half an hour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſunſet, ſummer and winter. At which time they hoiſt a white flag upon the <hi>Moſques</hi> to denote that it is the hour of prayer, it being contrary to their religion to have a bell ſound among them.</p>
                     <p>On Fridays they hoiſt a green flag, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a favorite color of Mahomet. All the ſlaves at this hour are ordered to leave work, except when they are fitting the corſairs for ſea in a hurry. Oftentimes when this is the caſe they are obliged to work all night, and go up to the gate, called <hi>Babazia,</hi> which is the marine gate, and before they can paſs, they are ſearched by the taſk-maſters, to prevent their ſtealing any thing from the Regency; if they are found with any thing, except a few chips, they do not eſcape puniſhment.</p>
                     <p>I have known a ſlave receive an hundred baſtinadoes for being found with three board nails.</p>
                     <p>Having related the daily labors of the ſlaves, I now proceed to give you an account of the proviſions they are allowed to ſubſiſt on, to enable them to perform this laborious ſlavery, and the cloathing they have allowed to keep
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:033747_0026_0FF9168334D0B8B0"/>
them from the cold rains and the ſcorching rays of the ſun.</p>
                     <p>About eight o'clock in the morning they are called by one of the taſk-maſters from their work to take breakfaſt. Which they receive in the following order. When they are called they all leave their work, and go near ſome ſacks of bread. As they paſs by, they are counted by one of the drivers, while another gives each man a loaf of bread: And to every eighth man he gives a wooden bowl with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a pint of vinegar, in this manner they paſs until all have received their allowance.—They then ſit down upon the ground to eat, and are commonly called to work in about ten minutes, and are ſeldom allowed more than 12. The ſame ceremony is paſſed at 12 o'clock, when they receive the ſame allowance. At night when the roll is called they receive ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loaf of bread, but no vinegar.</p>
                     <p>This is all the proviſion they have allowed them from the Regency. But oftentimes when they are at work on board the corſairs, the ſteward will give them a little ſweet oil, and ſometimes ſome olives, this they count a feaſt. Theſe loaves of bread weigh about three ounces and an half. I have weighed ſeveral and never found one to exceed three ounces and eleven drachms. So what bread each man has allowed him for a day, will not exceed eleven ounces, and it is ſo ſour, that a perſon muſt be almoſt ſtarving before he can eat it.—
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:033747_0027_0FF9168D787E47C0"/>
The reaſon of its being ſo ſour is their mixing the dough three days before it is baked.</p>
                     <p>To make this bread they ſift the bran of wheat, after the flour and middlings are taken out.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps you may think what I have already related could not be augmented, with additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal ſeverity, but alas, this is not all. The <hi>Bagnio</hi> in which the ſlaves ſleep, is built with ſeveral galleries, one above another; in each gallery are ſeveral ſmall rooms, in them the ſlaves ſleep. For the uſe of theſe rooms they muſt pay a certain ſum of money every moon to the <hi>Guardian Bachi,</hi> or ſleep in the open <hi>Bagnio,</hi> where they have nothing but the firmament to cover them. On the evening after the moon changes, the keeper of the <hi>Bagnio,</hi> calls out for all hands to pay for their rooms. If any one who has ſlept in a room during the moon, has not procured the money, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pay it down, his hands are put into irons behind him, and his legs chained to a pillar e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very night, until the money is paid. They are releaſed in the morning to go to their work and are chained again at night. Thoſe miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble objects are commonly relieved by the reſt of their fellow-ſufferers.</p>
                     <p>Some of the ſlaves are allowed a ſmall pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from their country, which enables them to pay this demand. Others are mechanics and work at their trades in the night, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure this ſum; others get it by theft, though they often hazard their lives by ſo doing;
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:033747_0028_0FF9168F14314BD8"/>
and many are obliged to ſleep every night up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the cold ſtones, with nothing but the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens to cover them, for want of money to pay this tribute.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Bagnio,</hi> where the ſlaves ſleep, is a kind of muſeum, belonging to the Dey; which contains a great number of Animals of prey. They are confined with chains in differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent apartments from where the ſlaves ſleep.—And are maintained by them; with Bullock's and Sheeps heads; this money muſt be paid every moon when they pay for the rooms they ſleep in.</p>
                     <p>There is ſtill another demand as unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as any of the former. After their <hi>Rama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> which is a faſt that continues a whole moon during which time they cannot eat, drink, ſmoak, or even wet their lips while the ſun is above the horizon, (what they do eat, is in the night) they have a great feaſt, which continues two days, on the evening previous to the feaſt, each ſlave muſt carry 2 fowls to the taſk-maſter; as a preſent; and a certain number of ſheep, is given them, for which each ſlave muſt pay his proportionable part. During thoſe two days, the ſlaves are locked in the <hi>Bagnio,</hi> and are allowed no kind of ſubſiſtence from the Regency except one ſmall loaf of bread which I mentioned before, and this they receive each night when the roll is called. The drivers, on the firſt morning of the feaſt, give each ſlave a loaf of good white bread, weighing about half
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:033747_0029_0FF91690A9EE44A8"/>
a pound, for which they had received two fowls from each ſlave the evening before.</p>
                     <p>In this deplorable ſituation, were upwards of 1,200 Chriſtian captives, dragging out a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable exiſtence, with the woeful appellation of ſlave preying upon their mind when I left Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers.</p>
                     <p>The cloathing which is allowed them for a year, is ſuch a ſuit as was contained in the bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle which I explained in a former part of this book, they receive it the firſt Friday after Chriſtmas, as before obſerved. The firſt Friday in January, when it begins on Friday excepted, then the ſecond, all the captives belonging to the Regency, are obliged to go about ſeven miles into the country, and gather reeds, and carry them to the Dey's garden, for Beans, Peas, &amp;c. to run upon, and this is a very tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous day's work.</p>
                     <p>At this ſeaſon of the year the rains fall in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance in that country, which renders the walking very diſagreeable as we do not follow the road, but are obliged to croſs fields, and meadows. The diſtance thoſe reeds are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried is about eight miles.</p>
                     <p>We go out at the eaſternmoſt gate of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty called <hi>Babazoone,</hi> and it is near 7 miles from this gate to the place where they are gathered, and from thence they muſt be carried to the Dey's garden, which is near a mile weſtward of the gate called <hi>

The puniſhments which are common for Chriſtian Captives, for different offences: For Mahometans and Jews, having committed ſimilar crimes, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with ſome entertaining ſtories of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments inflicted on the Chriſtian ſlaves, Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, Jews and Renegadoes, which occurred (to my knowledge) during my Captivity, and ſome accidents which happened.</head>
                     <p>THE puniſhments moſt common for ſmall offences, are baſtinadoes, of which I ſhall ſay but very little, having already related the manner of inflicting them; I ſhall how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever relate in the courſe of this chapter, a few inſtances of people being baſtinadoed for very ſmall offences or rather no offence at all.</p>
                     <p>In the month of October '93, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had the miſfortune of being an eye wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but of which I had a verbal account, 14 ſlaves of different nations, made an attempt to run away with a boat, but were finally overta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken after they were ſeveral leagues at ſea, and brought <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> to Algiers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="32" facs="unknown:033747_0031_0FF916A1592D82C8"/>
When they were landed, and carried before the Dey, he ordered the ſteerſman, and bowman to be beheaded, and the reſt to receive five hundred baſtinadoes each, to have a chain of 50 weight faſtened to each man's leg for life, and a wooden block of about 70lb. to the end of that, which they were obliged to carry up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their ſhoulder when they walked to do their work. When they are at work they lay the block down, and can only work within the length of their chain. When they have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to go further, they muſt carry the block, to the place where the work calls them.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe of them who were living when I left Algiers, which was the 13th July, '96, were ſtill in this miſerable ſituation.</p>
                     <p>They have different puniſhments for capital offences, ſometimes they are burned, or rather roaſted alive. At other times they are impal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This is done by placing the criminal upon a ſharp iron ſtake, &amp; thruſting it up the poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, by his back bone until it appears at the back of his neck.</p>
                     <p>For being found in company with a Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan woman he is beheaded, and the woman is put into a ſack and carried about a mile at ſea, and thrown overboard, with a ſufficient quantity of rocks, or a bomb, to ſink her. For ſuſpicion of being with one, the ſlave is caſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the woman baſtinadoed.</p>
                     <p>A ſlave for murder of another ſlave is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately beheaded. But for murder of a Mahometan he is caſt off from the walls of the
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:033747_0032_0FF8C4D7D5F1AD00"/>
city, upon iron hooks, which are faſtened into the wall about half way down.—Theſe catch by any part of the body that happens to ſtrike them, and ſometimes they hang in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the moſt exquiſite agonies for ſeveral days together before they expire. But ſhould the part that catches, not be ſtrong enough to hold them (for ſometimes this is the caſe, and the fleſh tears out) they fall to the bottom of the wall and are daſhed to pieces upon ſharp ſtones, placed there for this purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>If a ſlave endeavours to make his eſcape and is brought back, they are nailed to a gallows, by one hand and the oppoſite foot, and in this they expire in the moſt undeſcribable torture. But this method is not always practiced for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, for ſometimes they are only baſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doed, at other times they are beheaded. I never knew an inſtance of the former, during my captivity; though I have been an eye witneſs to the latter ſeveral times.</p>
                     <p>A ſlave for ſpeaking diſreſpectfully of the Mahometan Religion, is impoſed or burnt—For ſtriking a Turk he is executed in the ſame manner.</p>
                     <p>On the 16th of April, 1794, as all hands were at work in the mountains, Joſeph Keith, and Peter Barry, being very much fatigued, they went to a ſpring of water about fifty yards diſtant, from where the reſt of the ſlaves were at work, and after having drank ſome water they felt faint, and ſat down upon the graſs. The <hi>Guardian Bachi,</hi> obſerving them, ſent two
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:033747_0033_0FF916A6AD93E860"/>
taſk-maſters, and brought them to him, and ordered them one hundred baſtinadoes each, which was inflicted without heſitation. This was for being about five minutes abſent from their work, and this at a time when they ought to have been attended by a phyſician—Many inſtances of this kind I have witneſſed. Particularly on the 14th of Auguſt, '94, when a ſlave received three hundred baſtinadoes for no greater offence, than pulling ſix hairs cut of a horſe's tail, which belonged to one of the great men of the Regency.</p>
                     <p>In the month of November, 1794, as the ſlaves, were returning from work, and paſſing through the gate <hi>Babazia,</hi> (where they are ſearched by the taſk-maſters) one of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found with three board nails in his pocket, was carried before the <hi>Viguilhadge,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to be puniſhed with an hundred baſtinadoes, his indictment run as follows:—"you unbelieving Chriſtian dog, what occaſion could you have for theſe nails, unleſs you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to open ſome lock and ſteal."</p>

                     <p>Another circumſtance of this kind happened in March, 1796, one of theſe Oran ſlaves hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been informed, that the money for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the Spaniards, who deſerted from that place, was lodged in the hands of a Spaniſh prieſt, reſident at Algiers, and that he had neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected their liberation; the ſlave went to the prieſt, and aſked if he had money for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the Spaniards. Being anſwered in the negative, he drew a knife, and ſtabbed the prieſt in fourteen different places, and left him to all appearance dead. However, the prieſt recovered.

<pb n="36" facs="unknown:033747_0035_0FF916AB1425DA28"/>
this being deemed a breach of their religion, ſhe being found ſitting ſo near the chriſtians, it was ſuppoſed ſhe was waiting 'till ſome of them could find an opportunity of going to her.</p>
                     <p>As he was going with her he met a ſlave, who had been ſent by one of the taſk-maſters to bring a jug of water from an adjacent ſpring. The ſlave aſked what crime the woman was guilty of, that he was dragging her along in ſuch a manner, with her hands tied behind her. He was anſwered ſhe had been ſitting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſome buſhes waiting for the embraces of ſome Chriſtian. The ſlave having ſome hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, knowing ſhe would be puniſhed for ſuſpicion if ſhe was carried before the <hi>Cadi,</hi> and being confident theſe wretches are in general eaſily bribed, he offered three <hi>ſequins</hi> which was all the money he was maſter of, for her releaſe. The villain not being as eaſily bribed as the ſlave ſuppoſed, anſwered, "you are the Chriſtian dog whoſe embraces ſhe has been ſeeking," and calling a Turk to his aſſiſtance, who was at a ſmall diſtance from them, they dragged the two poor innocent victims before the <hi>Cadi,</hi> and they not being allowed to ſpeak in their own defence, the cauſe was laid before the judge in words to this purpoſe, "we found theſe two perſons out ſide the gate <hi>Babazoone,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſome buſhes in actual embraces." The <hi>Cadi</hi> then ordered the man to be carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Dey's palace, and there be beheaded, and the woman to be ſewed up in a ſack, with
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:033747_0036_0FF916ADB4565890"/>
a bomb ſhell at her feet, to be carried one mile at ſea, and thrown overboard. A few minutes after this ſentence was paſſed, and they were ordered to their reſpective places of execution, the <hi>Cadi</hi> was credibly informed that they had not been found together as it had been report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him. He then ordered them both to be baſtinadoed for ſuſpicion. This meſſage arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Dey's Palace juſt when the <hi>Novagi,</hi> (who is one of the Dey's corps of guard) was drawing his Scymitre to deprive an innocent Chriſtian of life. The poor ſlave however, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived five hundred baſtinadoes, which diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him in ſuch a manner, that he was unable to ſpeak for near forty eight hours, and was not capable of walking for upwards of two months afterwards.</p>
                     <p>While they were preparing to inflict his puniſhment, he was inceſſantly beſeeching them, to execute the former ſentence and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming, "Oh! that the <hi>Cadi</hi> had not been undeceived, that I might have died at one blow, and eſcaped theſe tortures." But alas, the meſſenger arrived too late for the poor woman, for ſhe was caſt into her watery grave a few minutes before the meſſage arrived.</p>
                     <p>About four days afterwards, ſhe was found upon the ſea-ſhore, diſengaged from the ſack and bomb-ſhell, looking nearly as freſh as when ſhe was alive.</p>
                     <p>She was then taken and interred, near the place where ſhe waſhed on ſhore, and has a large marble monument built over her remains.</p>

They now pray at her monument as a ſaint; and ſay if ſhe had not been innocent ſhe could not have diſengaged herſelf from the ſack and bomb-ſhell. But the poor Chriſtian, (though theſe bigoted ſuperſtitious beings were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the innocence of both theſe unhappy ſufferers) never received any redreſs. They would often deride him in this manner, "you was the occaſion of an innocent woman's death."</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>A Turk for offences capital, is ſtrangled in the following manner. The criminal is confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, with his back againſt a wall, in which are two holes, directly oppoſite the back of his
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:033747_0038_0FF8C4DD0D6663B0"/>
neck, through theſe holes is reaved a rope, with the two ends on the oppoſite ſide, from where the criminal is, and the bite or double of the rope coming about the criminals neck. Then the two ends are knotted together, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioner puts a ſtick in between the rope and wall. Then turning the ſtick round (as the ſea phraſe is) like a Spaniſh windlaſs, which twiſting the two parts of the rope together brings it tight about the criminal's neck, and he is ſoon diſpatched.</p>
                     <p>The executioner does not ſee the criminal while performing his office. This is accounted the moſt honorable death, for perſons who are executed. And beheading the moſt ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious.</p>
                     <p>A Turk for offences not capital, is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly baſtinadoed. A Moor or Arab, for enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous crimes, are ſometimes caſt upon the hooks; and at other times, hanged or behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For ſmall crimes they are enſlaved, (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to ſhare the fate of chriſtian captives) for a certain term of time.</p>
                     <p>For theft, they ſometimes have the right hand cut off, and hung about the neck—Then the criminal is ſet upon an aſs, and led through the city; with his face toward the aſſes tail, and hath ſometimes to wear his hand, hung by a ſtring about his neck, as he paſſes through the city, for ſeveral years.</p>
                     <p>A Jew for different offences hath various puniſhments; ſimilar to thoſe of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſlaves, and with not leſs ſeverity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="40" facs="unknown:033747_0039_0FF916B5E4AEFDC0"/>
Such is the groſs indignation the Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, bear toward the Jewiſh religion, that a Turk may with impunity, (if he flees to a <hi>Marabout Moſque,</hi> or pay a ſmall penalty,) murder ten of them. If he kills the eleventh, he is then ſtrangled, no <hi>Moſque</hi> or penalty will excuſe him: Nothing will ſave his life, except he is pardoned by the Dey, whoſe word is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute. A ſlave may with the ſame impunity, beat and abuſe them, in the ſtreets as he paſſes. While the poor Iſraelites are not allowed to lift their hand in their own defence, on penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of having it cut off. All the conſolation they will have, in ſuch caſes, from the Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans, is encouragement for the ſlaves, to continue their abuſe.</p>
                     <p>I have known fifty in one day, to receive five hundred baſtinadoes each, for being found with a red ſaſh about their waiſts. As they are not allowed to wear any colour except black.</p>
                     <p>A Renegado hath the ſame puniſhments as a Turk. If any Renegado, after embracing the Mahometan religion; deviates from its principles, the moſt ignominious death imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately follows.</p>
                     <p>I once knew an inſtance of this, during my captivity, which was in the month of February 1795, when a French merchant ſhip arrived at Algiers. One of the crew (through a miſtaken zeal,) expreſſed an inclination of embracing the Mahometan religion. He was accordingly cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, and made as they expreſs it a true
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:033747_0040_0FF916B9F39CE400"/>
believer. On his renouncing the Chriſtian religion, for that of Mahomet, the principal men in the city, made him a preſent of 5,000 Algerine <hi>Sequins.</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">A current Gold Coin in Algiers, the value of which is one Dollar and Eighty Cents.</note> He had not continued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 4 months, in this benighted ſuperſtition; before his conſcience ſmote him, and he repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his folly, for having abandoned the true worſhip of Jeſus Chriſt, and having embraced that of the impoſter Mahomet.</p>
                     <p>Behold him now with a conſcience ſtung with remorſe; his ſleepleſs nights are ſpent in meditating a poſſibility of his eſcape.</p>
                     <p>His livid countenance, haggard form, and gloomy aſpect, denote ſome weighty remorſe is preying upon his mind.</p>
                     <p>About the firſt of July 1795, two Engliſh frigates anchored in the bay. The ſame night he abandoned his riches, ſtripped himſelf na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and endeavored to ſwim to one of them, but was perceived by the centinals on board a guard boat, which was placed between the fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, and the ſhore, to prevent any ſlave mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his eſcape. They rowed after him and brought him back. They kept him confined on board the boat while morning, then carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him before the Dey, who ordered him to be beheaded immediately.</p>
                     <p>Thus ended the exiſtence of a wretch who was born a Chriſtian, and had exchanged the true religion for Mahometaniſm.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="42" facs="unknown:033747_0041_0FF916BCEFDCB368"/>
In the month of May '94, as all hands were at work, dragging thoſe large rocks before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the quay, one of the ſlaves a <hi>Neapolitan</hi> happened to fall down, being near the ſled, before it could be ſtopped, he was entirely cruſhed to pieces.</p>
                     <p>The taſk-maſters apparently rejoiced at the accident, and with ſmiling countenances, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered two ſlaves to gather the remains of his body in a baſket, and bury them at the Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian burial ground, ordering the reſt to go on with the rock, not giving them time to enquire what accident had happened. But telling them a chriſtian dog was gone to his own country. And many of them did not know what had happened for ſometime afterwards.</p>
                     <p>Another ſingular accident happened, about four months afterwards. As we were hauling rocks in the ſame manner, a Corſican ſlave ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally fell down, and the ſled went over his legs and knees, taking them both off, juſt above the joint of the knees, his legs and feet being cruſhed in ſuch a manner, that it was impoſſible to diſtinguiſh one part from anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. His father and ſix brothers who were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſlaves, were witneſſes of this dreadful acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. The father, his ſeven ſons, and five grand ſons, having been captured altogether on board one veſſel, about fifteen days before this accident happened.</p>
                     <p>As the unfortunate Chriſtian did not expire immediately, he was ſent to the hoſpital, where he remained two days in the moſt exquiſite
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:033747_0042_0FF916BF7A18E4F0"/>
agony. The king of terrors then put a period to his exiſtence.</p>
                     <p>When any ſuch accident happens among the ſlaves, it is immediately reported to the Dey. On hearing this, his obdurate heart was a little ſoftened, and he gave permiſſion that the father might attend his ſon, in the hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, while he lived.</p>
                     <p>This melancholy event, deprived a father of his ſon, ſix unhappy men of a brother, three children of a father, and a woman of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. In addition to the horrors of ſlavery, theſe miſerable relatives were left to bemoan the untimely death of the unfortunate ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer.</p>
                     <p>On the 16th of November, '94, about forty ſlaves were employed in carrying ſome pieces of old timber from an ancient building (which had formerly been a ſhelter for their gun boats on ſhore, time had now reduced it to ruins) to where was building a powder magazine.—</p>

                     <p>ALGIERS is a Country which derives its name from its Metropolis, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends four hundred and eighty miles in length from eaſt to weſt, along the northern coaſt of Africa, (this part of Africa is called Barbary.) Its greateſt breadth from North to South, is three hundred and twenty miles.</p>
                     <p>At the diſtance of about one hundred miles from the ſea coaſt, it becomes a barren deſert,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:033747_0044_0FF8C4E2B4566060"/>
almoſt entirely uninhabited by either man or beaſt.</p>
                     <p>Algiers is ſituated between 32 and 37 degrees of north latitude, correſponding to that of the United States, from Virginia to Carolina, inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive. It is bounded on the north, by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean ſea; on the South, by Mount At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las; on the eaſt, by the country of Tunis; and on the Weſt, by Morocco: It is ſeparated from that empire by the river Mulvia.</p>
                     <p>The principal rivers, which water the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of Algiers, riſe in Mount-Atlas, running by a northerly direction into the Mediterranean ſea; they are ſeven in number. None of them has a long courſe, or even is navigable; or at leaſt none of them are made use of in naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is however ſuppoſed that ſome of them might be made uſe of, for this purpoſe, were the inhabitants of a more intelligent and induſtrious character: for ſome of them are of a tolerable depth, and would admit large flat-bottomed boats to paſs with the greateſt eaſe, for the purpoſe of conveying their produce to the ſea ſhore.</p>
                     <p>Such is the groſs ignorance of the natives of this country, in whatever concerns domeſtic improvements, that there is not a ſingle bridge over any of their rivers. Although nature has formed them in ſuch a commodious ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that bridges might eaſily be conſtructed in many different places. Ferry-boats are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely unknown among them. When they
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:033747_0045_0FF8C4EACB394A80"/>
are to be croſſed, the traveller hath oftentimes to wander ſeveral miles in ſearch of a ford.</p>
                     <p>If a heavy rain happens to fall, he is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times forced to wait ſeveral days, before the river has returned to its natural depth.</p>
                     <p>This country conſiſts of eighteen provinces, which are commanded by <hi>Beys,</hi> who are ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to the <hi>Dey.</hi> The Beys of the provinces of <hi>Maſcara, Titeli,</hi> and <hi>Conſtanina,</hi> are obliged to ſend and carry their tribute to Algiers once every ſix months: They are obliged to appear before the Dey with the tribute annually themſelves. Six months after their departure from the Dey, they ſend the tribute by a <hi>Galief,</hi> he is a Secretary to the Bey or Governor.</p>
                     <p>The Bey's of other provinces bring their tribute once every two years. They being at ſuch a diſtance from the city, is the occaſion of its not being demanded oftener.</p>
                     <p>The climate in this country is remarkably delightful. The air is pure and ſerene. The ſoil is covered with almoſt a perpetual verdure. Extreme heat is not common. In winter it is ſeldom cold enough to freeze. I have been informed, that it has been known to freeze here, at the depth of two or three inches.</p>
                     <p>I once ſaw a little froſt, during my reſidence there, but not any ice or ſnow.</p>
                     <p>This deſcription applies to the lands on the ſea-coaſt; for as you advance into the country the land becomes more barren. Indeed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of the back country is a ſavage deſert, abounding with Lions, Tigers, Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard's,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:033747_0046_0FF916C775976FC8"/>
Jackall's, Buffaloe's wild Boar's Porcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine's, &amp;c. And it muſt be acknowledged, that theſe animals are not the leaſt amiable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of this country.</p>
                     <p>There are few towns at preſent in theſe ſtates of any conſequence, though when ſucceſſively under the dominion of Carthage, and Rome, they abounded with many populous cities, and to have a reſidence here was conſidered as the higheſt ſtate of luxury.</p>
                     <p>The produce of their ſoil formed the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines which formerly ſupplied all Italy and a great part of the Roman Empire, with corn, wine and oil. Though the lands are ill culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated through the oppreſſion and barbarity of the government, yet they are ſtill fertile: dates, figs, raiſins, almonds, apples, pears, cherries, plumbs, citrons, lemons, oranges, pomegranets, with plenty of herbs and roots.</p>

                     <p>The city of Algiers lies in lat, 36, 50, North and in long. 2 47, Eaſt, over againſt the Iſland of Minorca, three hundred and eighty miles weſtward of Tunis. It ſtands on a bay of the Mediterranean ſea. It is built upon the ſide of a very high hill, with ſo great an aſcent, that the houſes riſing gradually one above another from the ſea ſhore, it forms an amphitheatre, The city appears beautiful at a diſtance when approaching from the ſea. A perſon on firſt ſight of it at a diſtance would ſuppoſe it to be a ſnow bank. This is occaſioned by the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes being white-waſhed on the out ſide. The city is of a quadrangular form, and is near three miles in circumference, encompaſſed with two walls about twenty five feet diſtant from each other, and in ſome places an hundred feet
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:033747_0049_0FF916D335EFC128"/>
in heighth. The outward wall is defended by upwards of three hundred braſs cannon, and out ſide that is a deep entrenchment forty feet wide, over which are built bridges at the gates of the city. In the intermediate ſpace between the walls, are magazines for public ſtores. The mole of the harbour is about five hundred paces in length, extending from the continent to a ledge of rocks, where there are three caſtles, with large batteries of braſs guns. Theſe caſtles are known by the names of Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ella, Cordalaras, and Sardenia. On the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is a very excellent light houſe, from which the caſtle derives its name Fenelle, ſignifying (in Arabec,) a light.</p>
                     <p>This mole was begun and finiſhed in the reign of Hayradin. He commenced its foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in the year 1536, at this time, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, he had thirty thouſand Chriſtian ſlaves in his poſſeſſion. Theſe he obliged to work without intermiſſion for three years, in which the work was finiſhed; and he had now a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient harbour for the ſafety of his ſhips, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of containing between thirty and forty large veſſels; he alſo built ſeveral ſtrong forts, and erected a number of batteries, on many places that might favour the landing of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy. Several of the latter were deſtroyed in the expedition of Charles 5th in the year 1541. All the remaining ones have received great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements, ſince, and ſome new batteries e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected as occaſion required. He alſo built the caſtle <hi>

The city is computed to contain one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty thouſand inhabitants. The fortifications are extenſive and ſtrong. There are ſaid to be fifteen thouſand houſes, which are all built entirely with ſtone and lime, and are all flat roofed, they are commonly built round an oblong ſquare, with a paved court in the centre. Around this court is a triple range of Galleries, one above another which are ſupported by pillars. The principal build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are the Dey's palace, a hoſpital for Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian ſlaves, and ſeveral large moſques. The former ſtands near the centre of the city, is very large but not magnificent.</p>
                     <p>The hoſpital for Chriſtian ſlaves, ſtands in the principal ſtreet of the town. Is ſomewhat commodious, and tolerably well attended.—This hoſpital was erected as a deed of charity by the king of Spain, for the benefit of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian ſlaves, in the year—, and is ſtill main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the Spaniſh government.</p>
                     <p>When a ſlave is found ſo ſick that he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of doing any kind of work, they then permit him to go into this hoſpital, where he is ſuffered to remain until they ſuppoſe he is able to work again; while he remains here he is very well uſed by the Doctors and Prieſts.—They generally allow three or four of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and eight or ten of the latter to attend it.</p>
                     <p>The Doctors preſcribe the medicine, which is to be given to the patient, and the prieſt's prepare, and adminiſters it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="52" facs="unknown:033747_0051_0FF8C4E44437C1F8"/>
While a ſlave is ſick in this place, he is no manner of expence to the Regency, he being maintained with victuals, drink, medicine, and attendance by the Spaniards. It is the duty of a particular taſkmaſter, to viſit the hoſpital e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very morning, in order to take a view of the ſlaves, and to paſs his opinion upon them, or any particular one of them, concerning their, or his, ableneſs to perform the duty aſſigned the ſlaves in general, and if he finds any one whom he thinks (by his countenance, or any other circumſtance,) able to perform any kind of work, the forlorn ſon of wretchedneſs, is driven out from the hoſpital, to perform his taſk, among the reſt of his fellow ſufferers, and the Doctors are not even aſked whether they think he is able or not. And often times they are driven out in this-manner, to work, and are obliged to return to the hoſpital again, within a ſhort time after their departure and often expire in a few hours after their return. Cruelties of this nature are very common in this horrible place, and the untimely death of a Chriſtian, is nothing more thought of, by the inhabitants, than the death of one of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic animals.</p>
                     <p>A particular inſtance of this nature happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the 30th January, 1796. The unhappy ſufferer being an American, I have thought it worthy remark.</p>
                     <p>When Scipio Jackſon, (a blackman belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to New-York,) had been for ſome time ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry low with the cholic, ſo that his life had been
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:033747_0052_0FF916D779AED498"/>
deſpaired of for ſeveral days by the Doctors; he was now recovering, to all appearance, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry faſt; and was ſo far recovered as to be able to walk the room but the day before his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely death. He had juſt riſen from his bed, on the ſaid morning, when the taſkmaſter, who was known by the name of <hi>Salamoone,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the hoſpital, who on perceiving him walk, pronounced him able to work, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him to the marine, to perform his daily labour. He told the taſkmaſter, he was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to walk to the marine, and much leſs capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of performing his deſtined labour if he was there; at which the mercileſs villain, gave him ſeveral ſevere ſtrokes with his ſtick ſaying "if you are not able, I will make you able," and with that drove him to the marine. The Doctors uſed their utmoſt endeavours to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade him from it; and begged that he might be allowed to remain a few days longer; all their perſuaſions, and reaſoning were to no purpoſe, the wretch would not hearken to any thing they ſaid, but drove the poor man before him, to work. He accordingly with great difficulty arrived at the marine, where he did his work in the beſt manner his feeble condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would allow, for about half an hour, and being exhauſted he fell down upon the ground inſenſible. Upon this he was again ſent to the hoſpital, where he expired at two o'clock in the afternoon, and was in his grave before ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet.</p>

This alone is ſufficient to aſcertain the depth of the wretchedneſs of Chriſtians, whom fortune has unhappily thrown into the hands of thoſe deteſtable piratical barbarians. In former days, the Chriſtian captives when dead, were not allowed to be interred, but were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out about half a Mile to the eaſtward of the city, and precipitated down the banks into the ſea. This manner of diſpoſing of the dead bodies of Chriſtians, was practiſed by the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerines untill about the beginning of the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth century. At this time, a Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic prieſt, who was making a tour through Barbary, happened to be in Algiers, and the Plague raging very ſevere in the city, of courſe a great number of ſlaves died, and were caſt into the ſea, this dreadful ſpectacle, moved the heart of the humane Prieſt who poſſeſſing an independant fortune, purchaſed at an exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant price,<note n="*" place="bottom">It is reported that is coſt him 90,000 dollars.</note> about one acre of land for a burial place for chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>The day he paid the money for this piece of ground, the plague broke out in his groin, which put a period to his exiſtence in ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hours, conſequently he was the firſt who was interred on this piece of land, and perhaps the firſt Chriſtian that had been buried in the territory of Algiers ſince it was inhabited by Mahometans, as they formerly caſt all of this denomination into the ſea, who paid the laſt debt of nature near the ſea-ſhore. Thoſe who died in the country, were ſuffered to remain above ground.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="55" facs="unknown:033747_0054_0FF8C4E65CD178D0"/>
The author flatters himſelf that a deſcription of this piece of land will not be unaccepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his readers, he therefore preſents a ſhort and authentic account of it to their peruſal.—It lies about half a mile weſtward of the city, where is a piece of low land or meadow, this is dyked in with a mound to prevent the ſea from waſhing in, and deſtroying the produce of the land. The burial ground is between this mound and the ſea, conſequently, in a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy gale of wind, the violence of the waves waſhes the dead bodies out of their graves, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ocean, as the place is nothing more than a ſandy beach, and the corps are ſeldom buried more than one foot under the ſand.</p>
                     <p>According to the records of the nation, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of 98,000 Chriſtians have already been buried here, and ſcarcely any marks of a burial ground is to be diſcovered, more than the great quantities of human bones which are to be ſeen laying upon the beach. They keep four ſlaves whom age has rendered incapable of any other employment, to bury their deceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed companions, as it is contrary to the religion of Mahomet, for one of that denomination, to touch the dead body of a chriſtian.</p>
                     <p>With reſpect to the burial of their own dead, the Mahometans diſcover a degree of delicacy of which Chriſtians have no conception. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more common, in our Church yards, and ſurely nothing is more completely ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than to ſee graves broken up, a ſecond time before the perſon has returned to its original
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:033747_0055_0FF916E04B2BB208"/>
duſt; and the remains of the dead are toſſed about with very little ceremony. This wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed violation of decency ariſes from the orthor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox deſire of being buried in holy ground; a practice which has no doubt been encouraged by the parties concerned, for the purpoſe of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting high prices for the land.</p>
                     <p>Nothing would appear more ridiculous, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the profeſſors of the Mahometan Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than to ſee their graves opened, at any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of time, or upon any pretence whatever. They would regard this as an act of the moſt barbarous ſacrilege. Hence the burial ground of Algiers, or any large city of this profeſſion, are very extenſive, it is reported that ſome of the burial places, in the neighborhood of large cities, are nine, or ten miles in extent.</p>
                     <p>By this we may ſee that ſome uſeful leſſon is to be learned, from almoſt every nation in the world.</p>
                     <p>The Moſques are fine buildings, tho' they make no great appearance at a diſtance. They are 65 in number, ten of which are very large, which are called, Marabout Maſques, by reaſon of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Marabout or hermit buried in them.—Theſe they account holy places, and an aſylum for all kinds of vices.</p>
                     <p>A Turk having committed any crime what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, is pardoned if he can get into one of them before he is taken into cuſtody. Their religion teaches them to pardon a Mahometan, if he flees to thoſe Marabout or Saints, who
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:033747_0056_0FF916E2D09E8058"/>
are buried in thoſe moſques, for protection, let his offence be ever ſo capital.</p>
                     <p>Chriſtian ſlaves are alſo pardoned, having committed ſmall offences, if they can get into one of them before he is taken, he will have an additional chain upon his leg and a block at its end.</p>
                     <p>A Jew having been apprehended inſide the door of one of them, would be immediately burned or crucified. So the poor Iſraelites have no protection for their crimes, and muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the abſolute word of a deſpotic prince.</p>
                     <p>When a Mahometan, who has committed a crime, has taken the Marabout, it is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately reported to the Muftie, and he reports it to the Dey, who ſends a ſtring of beads by the Muftie to the keeper of the Moſque, and the criminal then comes out. Though he might come out before if he pleaſes, but ſhould he leave the Moſque, before the Muftie comes with the beads, he would be liable to the ſame puniſhment he was before he had taken the Marabout. The preſence of the Muftie and the beads denote his pardon. The Muftie then returns with the beads, to the Dey, and they are laid up until ſome other ſimilar occaſion. At the gates of the Dey's palace, there is a chain which is faſtened at the top of the gates and at night the lower end is faſtened down with a pad lock. Any ſlave who has commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an offence, and can get hold of this chain before he is taken, it ſerves the ſame purpoſe as the Marabout Moſque. If a ſlave has been
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:033747_0057_0FF916E78E812A50"/>
cheated by any Turk, Cologie, Moor, Arab, Renegado, or Jew, and he takes hold of this chain, and ſays he wants juſtice, one of the principal officers of the Dey's corps of guards goes to him and aſks the particulars of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wronged, and who the perſon is that has wronged him, and juſtice is immediately done him. But ſhould he give a wrong account, and it be proved that he has not told the truth, he is immediately baſtinadoed. If it is a Jew who is complained of, and he is found guilty, he muſt make the ſlave reparation and is baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinadoed.</p>
                     <p>This city contains a great number of hot bathes, which are large, and handſomely paved with marble; people of every denomination whatever are allowed to go into them and bathe, on paying double the ſum which is paid by a Turk. If a ſtranger happens to go in, they generally extort eight or ten fold.</p>
                     <p>The men ſpend a great part of their time in bathing, ſmoking, and drinking coffee.</p>
                     <p>Their religion obliges them to bathe four times a day, but many of them do it much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tener, for their own pleaſure. There are alſo ſeveral bathes for the uſe of women, who are not allowed to bathe only in the afternoon.—Thoſe among them who are able have theſe conveniences in their own houſes, that their women may not go out.</p>
                     <p>Few white women walk the ſtreets, except proſtitutes, and thoſe far advanced in years, and when theſe do they are obliged to be veiled.

The principal ſtreet extends from the eaſt gate of the city, to the weſt, is ſomewhat wide and magnificent. The reſt are all very narrow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodious and dirty, which renders it very difficult for paſſengers.</p>
                     <p>There are ſeveral tolerable edifices without the walls of the city, which add to the beauty of the environs.</p>
                     <p>Among theſe are a variety of Turkiſh ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchres, and monuments. Six of theſe mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uments ſtand in a circular figure; they were erected to the memory of ſix Deys, who were in the courſe of one day, ſucceſſively elected and murdered.</p>
                     <p>Algiers had formerly no other water than rain. A Moor, who had been driven out of Spain, conſtructed two aqueducts; by which it was ſoon ſupplied with abundance of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent water from the adjacent mountains. They have ſince conſtructed ſeveral others on the ſame plan as the two former. The country round this city is exceeding fertile; gardens, groves, and country ſeats are very numerous.</p>
                     <p>The Algerines are unacquainted with the art of pruning, and grafting trees..</p>
                     <p>At Meireija, which is about twelve miles from this city, are three hot bathes, which are natural curioſities. The principal one is 12 feet ſquare and three feet eight inches deep. The water is quite hot, and when it has filled the largeſt baſon, it runs through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſmaller one, where the ſews bathe, as they are not permitted to uſe the ſame bath with
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:033747_0059_0FF916E94D3E5D98"/>
the Mahometans. Theſe hot fountains are conjectured to proceed from the great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of ſulphre, nitre, and other inflamable ſubſtances in the bowels of the earth.</p>
                     <p>The people of the city of Algiers, in general ſpeak a compound of Arabec, Moreſco, and the remains of the ancient Phenecian langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: but in the country they ſpeak the proper Arabec tongue. The inhabitants of all denom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inations in the city for the moſt part, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the <hi>Lingua Franca.</hi> This is a kind of a dialect, which without being the proper lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of any country whatever, has a kind of univerſal currency all over the Mediterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, as the channel of information for people who cannot underſtand each other through a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny medium but this,</p>
                     <p>The public buſineſs of the nation, and the records are tranſacted in the Turkiſh tongue. The men by their laws and religion, are allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have four wives (if they are able to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe them) but they generally content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with two or three.</p>
                     <p>The huſband never ſees his wiſe before marriage, but accepts her upon the deſcription of her father. If ſhe has no father, the neareſt male relative performs this office. By this we may ſuppoſe he has generally a very partial account.</p>
                     <p>When the match is agreed upon, and the man has paid the father for the daughter (for in this country every man is obliged to buy his wife from her parents,) the bridegroom
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:033747_0060_0FF916EB0F8A7848"/>
ſends a preſent of fruit and ſweet meats, and entertains her relations with a feaſt, and muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal entertainments.</p>
                     <p>Eight days previous to the marriage, the bride is dreſſed in her richeſt apparel, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by four women; no one being allowed to ſpeak to her except her parents, and her four female attendants. At the expiration of which time, the bridegroom is (for the firſt time) conducted into the preſence of his wife, by the four women above mentioned, who are all veiled.</p>
                     <p>Theſe women after having ſeen a certificate from her parents, or neareſt ſurviving relative, lead the man by his hands, to where the bride is ſitting; when he is before her, ſhe riſes from her ſeat, and kiſſes his hands and feet.—This is a token of obedience &amp; honor to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. He then retires to his own houſe; and the bride is ſet on horſeback and led to his dwelling. They are then pronounced huſband and wife, by the four women, of whom I have been ſpeaking. After ſhe is ſafe delivered to her huſband, the females, who were invited to the nuptial feaſt, aſſemble themſelves, and walk through the ſtreets, &amp; at the ſeveral cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners they pronounce the bands, to the public, by ſhouting out all together, as loud as they can, and with ſuch ſtrong ſhrill voices that they my be heard two miles.</p>
                     <p>In the city of Algiers, the men wear large turbans, having their heads cloſely ſhaved, and
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:033747_0061_0FF916F18B944390"/>
for the moſt part wear their beard—ſome only wear their whiſkers.</p>
                     <p>Their longeſt jackets, which have ſleeves, they wear next their ſhirt, and then a veſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that, always taking care to have the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt garment outſide. Their ſhirts are made with neither collar nor wriſtbands, their bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſomething like a woman's petticoat reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down to their knees. Stockings are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely unknown among them; they always go with their legs bare. Their ſhoes have ſquare toes with no heels.</p>
                     <p>People of any denomination whatever, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Jews) are allowed to dreſs in this ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit. No perſon is allowed to dreſs in green; this colour they hold ſacred it being a favorite colour of Mahomet. A <hi>ſherief,</hi> who they ſay is deſcended from Mahomet, is known by a green turban. The Jews are obliged to dreſs entirely in black, and wear ſhoes without any quarters.</p>
                     <p>People of condition, ſometimes wear buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins. They never move their turban, but pull off their ſlippers, when they attend religious duties, or the perſon of their ſovereign.</p>
                     <p>They are very fond of ſtriped or fancied ſilk. The chief furniture of their houſes conſiſts of Carpets and matraſſes, on which they ſit and lie. They are prohibited Gold and Silver veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. Several families generally live in one houſe; I have known thirty Jew families to live under one roof.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="63" facs="unknown:033747_0062_0FF916F322EC6248"/>
The women dreſs, with a ſort of cap upon their heads, of either Gold, Silver, Braſs, Pew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or Tin, according as their fortune will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford; and wear ſhort jackets, and long trowſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. After they are married, they are obliged to have white trowſers, but before they wear a ſort of calico; they are obliged to wear a veil when they go out of their houſes, though ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few are allowed to go out at all.</p>
                     <p>They mark their forehead, chin, and noſe, with india ink, and ſtripe the backs of their hands, and fingers with black, and colour their finger nails red.</p>
                     <p>The preſent inhabitants of the territory of Algiers are compoſed of many different nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The Turks, are the firſt people among them, and have all the government and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in their own hands, and no man can hold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny poſt of great diſtinction among them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he is a real Turk.</p>
                     <p>The Cologlies, are next the Turks in power. Theſe are perſons born of a Mooriſh mother, the Father being a Turk. The Arabs, who trace their deſcent from the diſciples of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet, who formerly ſubdued Algiers.—Moors or Moreſcoes, who were driven out of Spain about the end of the ſixteenth century. Renegadoes, Levantines, Jews, and Chriſtian ſlaves, with a crowd formed of the poſterity of all theſe different people, make the reſt of the population.</p>
                     <p>The Cologlies, Moors, and Arabs, are the moſt numerous inhabitants of the city and
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:033747_0063_0FF8C4ED1FEA5960"/>
towns. They compoſe the great body of the inhabitants. The latter of theſe are thieves &amp; murderers by profeſſion. Travellers who are led to their country, through motives of curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity or devotion, are ſtruck with terror on approaching the Deſerts.</p>
                     <p>Theſe robbers traverſe the country in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable troops, on horſe back: They aſſault &amp; plunder the Caravans.</p>
                     <p>So late as the year 1750, a body of 50,000 Arabians attacked a caravan of Merchants, coming from Mecca, killed 60,000 perſons, &amp; plundered it of every thing valuable, tho' eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corted by a Turkiſh army.</p>
                     <p>But it may reaſonably be ſuppoſed, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid ſuch a variety of different races, immenſe numbers cannot be ſaid to belong to any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular tribe or nation whatever.</p>
                     <p>As to the nature of the inhabitants, they are moſtly of a lazy idle diſpoſition, and curſed with all the vices of mankind; miſtruſtful to the laſt degree, falſe, jealous, and the very pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ignorance! They ſtile themſelves, <hi>Muſſelmon,</hi> or true believers; yet there is no confidence to be put in their word, upon any occaſion whatever, except when they promiſe to do you an injury, in which promiſe they ſeldom fail, and on which you may ſafely rely. They are often famed by Spaniſh hiſtorians for men of gallantry, but I could never think they are inclined that way, but believe them nearly to equal the Spaniards in cowardice. They are but indifferent ſoldiers, the greateſt part of
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:033747_0064_0FF8C4F93AE93510"/>
their ſkill conſiſts in the management of a horſe, and it muſt be confeſſed, they manage theſe animals with a great deal of dexterity. They abominate the very name of and culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the moſt inveterate hatred againſt Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, and are continually like ravenous wolves ſeeking means to deſtroy them.</p>
                     <p>Mahomet has taught them in his alcoran, (or koran, for the two names appear to be ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonymous) that all of his faith who are ſlain fighting againſt the Chriſtians, immediately enter into Paradiſe in triumph: he even tells them their horſes, if they die in battle, are tranſlated into heaven; for they hope to have the pleaſure of riding there as well as on earth.</p>
                     <p>They believe the women have no ſouls, and are only formed for propagation; they are therefore not allowed to enter their moſques, becauſe they eſteem them incapable of being received into heaven: Yet the women ſay their prayers ſecretly at home.</p>
                     <p>The men have uſually a ſtring of beads in their hands, like the Roman Catholics; and for every bead they have a ſhort prayer, which, as they repeat, they let drop through their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. Their prayers conſiſt only in the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent attributes of God, as, "God is good,—God is great—God is infinite—God is merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, &amp;c."—The commanders of thoſe wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es only differ from their ſubjects, in a larger propenſity of their ill qualities, with the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a degree of cruelty and avarice.</p>
                     <p>

All foreigners are allowed the free uſe of their religion; but the eſtabliſhed religion in Barbary is Mahometaniſm. Many of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Morocco follow the tenets of the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, a modern ſectary, and an enemy to the ancient doctrines of the Califs. All of them have much reſpect for Idiots—whoſe protection in ſome caſes, ſcreens offenders from puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for notorious crimes.</p>
                     <p>In the main, however, the Moors of Barbary, as the inhabitants of theſe ſtates are now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly called, (becauſe the Saracens firſt entered Europe from Mauritania, the country of the Moors) have adopted the very worſt parts of the Mahometan Religion, and ſeem to have retained as much of it as countenances all their vices. The men commit the moſt unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural crimes with impunity.</p>
                     <p>Every one is amazed to find theſe people ſo ſubmiſſive and patient under ſo exceſſive and cruel a tyranny: But they ſhould underſtand, (bating their want of power) that they are taught to believe, if they fall by the hand of their king, whom they call Xerif, or Sherief, (which ſignifies Mahomet's ſucceſſor) they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately go up to heaven; and thoſe who would not willingly be ſent to Heaven before their time, muſt be very particular how they conduct themſelves.</p>
                     <p>But ſtill we may derive ſome uſeful leſſons from theſe Barbarians. The Algerines and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mahometans would regard it as the vileſt act of prodigality, to ſee the leaſt morſel of
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:033747_0066_0FF916F900C138D8"/>
food waſted; they would expect to be viſited with famine, ſhould they ſuffer ſuch waſteful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as is practiſed in many families in this country. Soon after my arrival at Algiers, as I was returning from my labor at night, and paſſing by a ſhop, a Turk, who was ſitting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſhop window ordered me to ſtop, and pointing to the ground, told me to take up a ſmall crumb of bread, which lay upon the pavement, accordingly I took it up and ate it; which the Turk perceiving, he gave me a cake weighing nearly half a pound, and told me, if I had not ate the ſmall crumb, he ſhould not have given me the loaf. This was the greateſt deed of charity, I ever knew from a Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, during my reſidence in this wretched place.</p>
                     <p>Algiers retains the title of a kingdom; it is however a military republic, though it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly can reflect no luſtre on that ſpecies of government, The national ordinances run in theſe words: <hi>"We, the great, and ſmall members of the mighty and invincible militia of Algiers."</hi> The Dey is elected by the ſoldiery. He ſeldom ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures his office without tumult &amp; blood-ſhed; and he often falls by the dagger of an aſſaſſin. This ſovereign, may, with peculiar propriety, adopt the expreſſion of one of the heroes of Oſſian:</p>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Where battle's rag'd, lo! I was born,</hi>

                     <l>
                        <hi>'T was there I drew my breath!</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>And blood muſt mark my lonely ſteps</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Down to the gates of death.</hi>
                     </l>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="68" facs="unknown:033747_0067_0FF8C4EFDBC8A3F0"/>
The manner in which his authority is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, correſponds with that by which it was obtained. The Dey has a corps of guards; a very neceſſary, though perhaps a fruitleſs precaution; as any private ſoldier who has the courage to aſſaſſinate him, ſtands an equal chance of becoming his ſucceſſor. An experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this deſcription has been made, ſince the beginning of the preſent century, when ſix private ſoldiers entered into a conſpiracy to murder the Dey of one of the Barbary ſtates. They entered his palace, and gave him a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal wound, by thruſting a ſcymetre into his ſide, in the midſt of a croud of people. He fell down and expired, exclaiming; "Has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body the courage to kill a villain?" One of the conſpirators, inſtantly aſcended the vacant throne, and brandiſhing his naked ſcymitre, declared that he would do juſtice to all! while his five aſſociates, were endeavouring to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the title of their new ſovereign, and none preſent ſeemed to give themſelves any concern about what had happened. He had not remained above ten minutes in this ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when an old ſoldier unobſerved took aim with a muſket or blunderbuſs, and ſhot him dead. Upon this, the five others were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately diſpatched by the people preſent. Such ſcenes as theſe do not unfrequently occur in tyrannic countries; and ought to teach both rulers and ruled in this happy country juſtly to appreciate the bleſſings of liberty and good government. The very ſpot now inhabited

by theſe mercileſs Barbarians, whoſe very breath ſeems to dry up every thing noble, great or good, was once the ſeat of Liberty and ſcientific improvements. But cities, towns, all, all are gone, &amp; hardly left a wreck behind to point the traveller where they ſtood.</p>

The <hi>Muftie,</hi> the <hi>Cadi,</hi> and the grand Mara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, are known by the largeneſs of their tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans. The former is the high Prieſt.

They were formerly looked upon with diſdain and treated with deriſion. But ſince the propheſy of Yuſef (who was one of theſe Hermits) concerning the deſtruction of the Spaniards (which was the expedition of Charles the 5th, in the year 1541,) they have been accounted Saints.

                     <p>They have but one copper coin, this they call <hi>drahame ſegaria,</hi> 1160 of which make a dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</p>
                     <p>The chief of their diet is bread, oil, olives, vinegar and Sallad. They very ſeldom eat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny meat. When they do, one pound is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for ſix or eight people, and this they think extravagant. They profeſs not to drink any ſpirituous liquors, and if any one is ſeen intoxicated, he is no more accounted a true Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan. Many of them will however drink to exceſs, when they are out of ſight of any others of their religion. Many inſtances of this kind I have ſeen; particularly one <hi>Muſtafa,</hi> an Alge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, would often go into the <hi>Bagnio,</hi> and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe wine from the ſlaves, at double price,
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:033747_0071_0FF917072F1EF530"/>
which they had bought for their own uſe, and ſit down and drink among them. One even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as I went in after returning from my labor, I ſaw <hi>Muſtafa</hi> drinking wine, and eating pork ſauſages. I aſked him if he knew what he was eating, he anſwered in great rage, <hi>uz coot ſanza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fida unta main ſchelim, una main arfſhi,</hi> which in Engliſh is, "Hold your tongue you unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, if you do not tell me, I ſhall not know."</p>
                     <p>They bury their dead in the following man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. The corps is waſhed in water, then ſew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in a winding ſheet, put upon a bear, and carried to the grave, where they are buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a ſitting poſture. No females are allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to follow any corps whatever. Any Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan who dies with the plague, is carried to the grave as faſt as the bearers can run. All the followers ſing while they are going. They imagine all Mahometans who die with this diſorder are called by the Supreme Being, and are happy to all eternity. But people of any other religion, who die with it, they ſuppoſe are damned. At each end of the grave they place a ſmall earthen pot, containing about half a pint, which the keep filled with water, preſuming that their friends, if not happy, will be relieved or comforted with their drink.—They alſo plant peaſe and beans on the graves of their friends, and lay fragrant buſhes on them, for the comfort and ſupport of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted relatives. The old women alſo every friday morning repair to the manſions of the dead, to carry ſuch proviſions as bread, beans,
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:033747_0072_0FF91708C86B9FD8"/>
peas, and plumbs. Theſe they expect their friends if unhappy, will receive; if they are happy, they are willing the cats ſhould partake the repaſt. Theſe animals croud the grave yards in hundreds.</p>
                     <p>The preſent Dey of Algiers, is between ſixty and ſeventy years of age—is a thick well built man, with his white beard covering his breaſt. He is of a light complexion. Does not appear to be much decayed by the weight of years, which have rolled over his head. He is of a very malicious diſpoſition; and, often (when he is in a rage) commands deeds of inhumani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be committed, of which it is ſaid he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents afterwards.</p>
                     <p>His family conſiſts of himſelf, wife, and one daughter. His wife and daughter have a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate palace, at a little diſtance from that of the Deys; and have a great number of female Chriſtian ſlaves to ſerve them. The Dey vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits them every Thurſday evening, abides with his wife the night, and returns to his own pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace on Friday morning.</p>
                     <p>The Dey, has alſo a number of male Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an captives, to wait upon him. One cooks his victuals, another ſets his table, waits upon him while eating—makes his bed—and ſees that all things in his apartment are kept clean. The others do any kind of work that is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. He keeps no Seraglio, as is generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported; he has but one wife, and ſleeps with her, but once a week.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="74" facs="unknown:033747_0073_0FF9170A9241A520"/>
When the Dey eats, he has a table about 4 inches high, on which is ſet ſeveral different diſhes, with neither plates, knives or forks, they eat only with ſpoons, their victuals being cut ſmall before it is ſet upon the table; and they can touch their victuals only with their right hand. They ſit always on the floor, (which has a mat or carpet upon it) as chairs are entirely unknown among them. The common people only differ from the Dey, by having no table whatever; their diſhes being ſet upon the floor.</p>
                     <p>The Turks are a well built robuſt people, their complexion not unlike Americans, tho' ſomewhat larger in ſtatue, but their dreſs, and long beards, make them appear more like mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters than human beings. The Cologlies are ſomewhat leſs in ſtature than the Turks, and are of a more tawney complexion. The Moors or Moreſcoes, are generally a tall thin, ſpare ſet of people, not much inclining to fat, and of a very dark complexion, much like the Indians in north America. The Arabs, or Arabians, are of a much darker complexion than the Moors, being darker than the Mulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes. They are much leſs in ſtature than the Moors, being the ſmalleſt people I ever ſaw; very few arrive at the height of five feet, and are generally near of a ſize. Theſe people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the greater part of the Piſaras, or porters in the city. As they are not allowed to trade in any mercantile line, nor even to learn any mechanic art, they are obliged to be drudges
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:033747_0074_0FF9171081D2CFE8"/>
to their ſuperiors, to gain the hard earned morſel on which they ſubſiſt.</p>
                     <p>The Algerines maintain about ſix thouſand five hundred foot, conſiſting of Turks, Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glies, or the ſons of Soldiers: About one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of them do garriſon duty, and part of them are employed in fomenting differences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the neighboring Arab princes. Beſides theſe, the Dey can bring two thouſand Moor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh horſe, into the field. Thoſe troops are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der excellent diſcipline.</p>
                     <p>Of their learning, or learned men, little can be ſaid.</p>
                     <p>The Turks profeſs the greateſt contempt for Learning. Greece which was the native coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of genius, arts and ſciences, produces at preſent, beſide Turks, numerous bands of Chriſtian Biſhops, prieſts and Monks, who, in general, are as ignorant as the Turks them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The education of a Turk ſeldom ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends further than to the reading the Turkiſh language, and the Koran, and writing a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon letter. Some of them underſtand aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, ſo far as to calculate the time of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe; but theſe are comparatively few, and regarded as extraordinary perſons. Of litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in modern Turkey, a curious ſpecimen was printed in the year 1769, at Vienna. The Book, which is a French tranſlation, is enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, "A treatiſe upon Tactics, or an artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al method for the diſcipline of troops; a work printed and publiſhed at Conſtantinople, by <hi>Ibrahim Effendi,</hi> officer Mutte ferrika of the Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman

Porte. The original appeared in 1730, and was intended as an experiment for the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhment of a Turkiſh preſs. The Turks are ſaid, upon a ſuperficial compariſon, to have preferred the uſe of manuſcripts, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign for want of encouragement was laid aſide. The preface of Ibrahim begins thus: "In the name of the moſt Climent and merciful God, praiſes, thanks and benedictions be to the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign maſter of the empires and kingdoms of the heavens and earth; to the maſter of Glory and omnipotance, God moſt high and moſt holy, who is the principal and the ſource of all order and ſymmetry in the univerſe, whoſe ſupreme will rules the affairs of the ſons of Adam, and whoſe decrees, direct all the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men." In this book the writer cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures his countrymen, for their negligence as to the acquiſition of modern diſcipline. To the curious, an extract from this work may not be altogether unentertaining:—"In for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages," ſays the writer, "when the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians made leſs uſe of cannon, muſkets, and granadoes, and when the principal arms of war, were ſabres, the Muſſulmen, ſuperior to all nations, in the management of theſe wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, made a progreſs ſo rapid, that the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians ſcattered upon the face of the earth, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhed at their victories and daring no more to oppoſe themſelves to the irreſiſtable force, remained during ſome time in the greateſt conſternation. In the end, invoking heaven and earth, to find ſome remedy to their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:033747_0076_0FF917160AA59DD0"/>
&amp; exploring every reſource without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on what ſide to turn themſelves, they made a laſt effort to invent an expedition pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to repair their loſſes. At firſt they were unanimouſly deſirous to perfect the uſe of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, of muſkets, and other arms. Afterwards, ſeeing, that the aſſiſtance of theſe was ſtill too weak to ſupport the impetuous attacks of the muſſelmen, and in particular thoſe of the Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman armies, they made new attempts, and laboured, all in concert, to oppoſe themſelves to this fatal deſtiny, and to find ſome means of reſiſtance. At laſt, after many conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and conferrences, the unanimous reſult of their deliberations was, that after having given a better form to their artillery, and their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenals, it would be neceſſary to find ſome means of ſubjecting their unfortunate troops, by certain rules, to a conſtant and firm diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, ſo that the ſoldiers reſtrained in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect order, finding no opportunity of flying, and of deſerting their ranks, nor time enough to think of danger and to terrify themſelves with the thoughts of inſtant death, might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, in ſpite of their inclination, in their ranks, ſeeing themſelves indiſpenſably forced to it.—Afterwards they thought that it was neceſſary to give more conſiſtency to their lines, ranged in order of battle, and to invent new diſcipline, to render them more firm, immovable, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſupporting the thundering ſhock <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

object of their attention, they have, at laſt, by their indefatigable application, arrived ſo far as to reduce the rules and principles of tactics to a particular art, and to treat them method<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ically in books compoſed upon the military ſcience."</p>
                     <p>The greateſt part of their commerce, is with the Sweeds, Danes, Dutch, French, Spaniards, Raguſeans and Engliſh. The commodities they trade in, are Wheat, Barley, Oil, Olives, Figs, Raiſins, Wax, Honey, Silks, Almonds, Dates, Wool, Leather of different colors, which is commonly called, Morocco Leather, Horſes, Mules, &amp;c. Their Manufactures are chiefly Silks, and Woolen Carpets. In return, the Europeans furniſh them with timber, artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, gun-powder, and whatever they want ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their public or private capacity. No nations are fond of trading with theſe ſons of plunder, owing to their capricious deſpotiſm, and the villainy of their Individuals.</p>
                     <p>Having given a ſhort account of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and cuſtoms of the people in the city; I now proceed to give a ſhort ſketch, of thoſe in the country.</p>
                     <p>The people in the country, have no houſes, but live in tents, and remove from one place to another, as they want paſture for their herds and flocks, or as any other accidental circumſtance may happen to make it neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>The excellence of the climate renders this ſimple way of living tolerable, though the tents of theſe people are mean, their utenſils of
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:033747_0078_0FF9171A9510E220"/>
little value, and their lodging filthy. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily and their domeſtic animals lie promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly in the tents together, except the dogs, which are left on the out-ſide as guards. They raiſe conſiderable numbers of bees and ſilk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms. They ſubſiſt chiefly on fruit, rice and bread. Wine and Sprituous liquors, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt entirely unknown among them. The Dey demands from them a tribute, which is procured by the Beys and carried to Algiers. The manner of gathering this tribute is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: The Dey informs the Bey what ſum muſt be paid, for the enſuing year, in the province which he commands or governs. The Bey then goes at the head of a large body of caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to collect it. And many of them on hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his approach retire to inacceſſible places in the mountains, until the troops are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn, in order to evade the payment. If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe who do not abſcond, ſhould make the leaſt equivocation he takes from them whatever he pleaſe. Should they make any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, or even intimate that they are diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfied with his proceedings, he cuts off their heads and ſends them in triumph to the Dey. And after it has been carried twice from the Deys palace, to the gate <hi>Babazoone,</hi> and expoſed to public view, they then bury it. Thoſe Beys ſeldom are in office more than two or three years, for by this time they have enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves to ſuch a degree (by plundering and robbing) that the Dey or Divan invents ſome crime againſt them, for which they are
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:033747_0079_0FF9171F32752510"/>
ſoon executed, and all their property is brought to the city and depoſited in the treaſury.</p>
                     <p>Should any of thoſe who retire to the mountains, to evade the payment of the tribute be apprehended, they are put to the moſt ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious death, and all their property is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the benefit of the public.</p>
                     <p>The dreſs of the men, is only a coarſe wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en cloth wrapped round the ſhoulders, which falls down as far as their ancles, with a cap of the ſame cloth, and a twiſted woolled turban over that. The women pay ſome more atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ornament themſelves with dreſs. They are dreſſed with a long woollen cloth, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like that of the men's, with a great number of pewter, and braſs broaches fixed upon it, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſhoulders, arms, and breaſt. They adorn their heads, with ſeveral of theſe broach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es fixed in their hair, and a braided woollen ſtring paſſed ſeveral times round their heads, which is filled with ſeveral different kinds of flowers. The huram, or apartment of the Turkiſh women is not only impenetrable, but muſt not be regarded on the outſide with any degree of attention. To approach them when abroad will give offence; and in the town, if they cannot be avoided, it is the cuſtom to turn to the wall and ſtand ſtill, without look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing toward them while they paſs. The Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh women claim an exemption from their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement on one day only in the week, when they viſit their relations, and are ſeen going in companies to the bathes, or ſetting in the bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

grounds on the graves of their friends their children, huſband, or parents. They are then enwrapped and beclothed in ſuch a manner, that it is impoſſible to diſcern whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are young or old, handſome or ugly. Their heads, as low as the eye-brows are cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered with white linnen, and alſo their faces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath; the prominency of the noſe and mouth giving them nearly the viſage of mummies.—They draw a veil of black gauze over their eyes the moment a man or boy comes in view.—They wear ſhort looſe boots of leather, red or yellow, with a large ſheet over their common garments, and appear very bulky. They uſe various arts to heighten their beauty—ſuch as decorating their hair with ſmall bits of ſilver gilded, reſembling a violin in ſhape, and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in at regular diſtances. Their method of colouring the laſhes of the eye is ſomewhat cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. They throw incenſe of gum of Lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num on ſome coals of fire, intercept the ſmoak which aſcends in a plate, and collect the ſoot. They cloſe one of their eyes, take the two laſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es between the finger, and thumb of the left hand, pulling them forward, and then thruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in at the external corner a bodkin, which has been immerſed in the ſoot, and extracting it again, the particles before adhering to it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main within, &amp; is preſently ranged round the organ, ſerving as a ſoil to its luſtre, beſides contributing, as they ſay to its health, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing its apparent magnitude.</p>

The children are ſuffered to go naked till 8 or 9 years of age. The <hi>Sheck,</hi> or chief of a tribe, is known by a linnen garment inſtead of a woollen, and a linnen turban, he alſo wears a pair of ſhoes, made of dreſſed leather.</p>
                     <p>The common ſort of people ſeldom wear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhoes at all, and when they do, they are made of undreſſed leather, with hair on the outſide. Theſe people are commonly called Arabs; their cuſtoms, language and religion bear a ſtrict affinity with thoſe of Arabia.—When a young man would marry, he drives a number of cattle to the tent where the parents of his miſtreſs reſide. The bride is then ſet on horſe back, and led to the tent of her lover, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the ſhouts and huzzas of a multitude of young people, who have been invited to the nuptial feaſt. When ſhe arrives at the tent where the young man reſides, a mixture of milk, and honey is given her to drink, and a ſong is ſung ſuitable to the occaſion. She then alights and receives a ſtick from her huſband, which ſhe thruſts into the ground, and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her right hand upon its end, ſhe repeats ſome words to the following effect:</p>

duty that he may aſſign her. Theſe previous cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies being ſettled, all the company ſet down by the tent, and the evening concludes with the greateſt jollity. They feaſt upon Dates, Almonds, Raiſins, Olives, and Oil, and drink <hi>Sherbot,</hi> which is water, having run through Raiſins, ſomewhat like making lye of aſhes.—Subſequent to the marriage, the wife is veiled and never ſtirs from the tent of her parents, for the ſpace of a whole moon, and no one can ſee her, except her parents, during this time. Theſe are the ceremonies, which I have been informed by the Algerines are cuſtomary in celebrating a marriage, among thoſe ſavage tribes of Barbary, but I never had an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of viewing one of them.</p>
                     <p>The economy of theſe people, to keep their clothes dry in a ſtorm, is worthy the attention of the reader, I have therefore preſented the following anecdote to their peruſal. One day as I was at work about two miles from the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, there aroſe a very heavy ſhower of rain, and for my part I would willingly have got under ſome tree, or ſomething elſe, if I had been allowed ſo to do to ſhelter myſelf from the tempeſt. But juſt before the rain began, I obſerved five of the natives at a ſmall diſtance driving ſome mules, loaded with coals, toward the city, who, on perceiving the rain was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, very calmly ſtopped their beaſts, and began to undreſs themſelves. This excit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my curioſity to know what they were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about. And as I was digging with a hoe,

having my back toward them, I immediately turned myſelf about and kept at my work with my face the other way, in order to obſerve their proceedings, without neglecting my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, which if I did, I was ſure would bring the bloody ſcourge of the unrelenting taſk-maſter upon my back. I therefore kept ſteady about my work, and looking at them as often as I dared, obſerved they ſtripped themſelves with a great deal of precipitation; then making their cloathes up in a bundle they took each one a rock about the bigneſs of a water pail, and laying the bundle upon the rock, they covered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it with their bodies having their hands and feet upon the ground; all their care was to keep their cloathes ſecure from the wet, while their naked bodies were expoſed to the fury of the weather. When it had done raining they took their cloathes in their hands, and drove on their mules a few ſteps, till they came to ſome buſhes, then taking up ſome dry leaves that lay under them, and had been kept from the wet by the ſhelter which the buſhes afforded, they wiped each other nearly dry, then dreſſed themſelves and went on. If a perſon was ſeen to do ſo in this country, he would be counted a fool or a madman; however I muſt confeſs I thought them ſomething in the right; for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſtorm is over, be it ever ſo violent, they have dry cloathes on their backs to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue their journey with. This being the firſt time I ever ſaw this ſingular method uſed, if exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſome aſtoniſhment, but it being ſo often prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed,
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:033747_0084_0FF9172B581B3808"/>
it ſoon became natural. The people in the city, will commonly pull off their ſhoes, when the ſtreets are muddy and walk bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed, to preſerve their ſhoes from being da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maged. I am informed that thoſe who tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel on horſe back or on other beaſts, have a bag, covered with an oil-cloth, in which they thruſt their cloathes in ſtormy weather, and ride ſtark naked. Allowing this to be cuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary among the ſoldiers, as it probably is, I fancy, if an army of them ſhould be met in a ſtorm, in this country, it would create a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible fright, and perhaps do as much executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to an ignorant body, as their offenſive arms, and oblige them to ſeek for ſafety in their heels.</p>
                     <p>Theſe wretches have their heads cloſe ſhav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, all except one ſmall lock on the top, which they never cut off; they being taught by the Alcoran, that Mahomet is to draw them up to their imaginary Paradiſe by that ſmall look of hair. They never ſhave their faces at all, but ſuffer their beards and muſtachoes to grow long, in the length and largeneſs of which, they take a particular pride; and he that has a very large beard, they allow to be a wiſe man. They are as ſtrict, as to their religion, as the people are in the towns and cities, they riſe carry and late to prayers; but only like children, do it becauſe they are ordered ſo to do by the Mufti, who is the high prieſt of their religion: And to him in eccleſiastical matters
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:033747_0085_0FF8C50458FA41B0"/>
they pay the moſt implicit obedience and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation.</p>
                     <p>"The beaten path of ignorance they tread."</p>
                     <p>In a former page I promiſed my readers, a further deſcription of Oran, which I ſhall now endeavour to perform.</p>
                     <p>Oran is ſituated about eighty leagues weſt of Algiers; is a mile and an half in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. It lies partly on a plain and partly on the aſcent of a hill, and is well fortified. As the Spaniſh coaſts and Merchant ſhips, had ſuffered much from the corſairs of this port, Ferdinand, King of Spain, determined to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt its reduction. Accordingly he tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into Africa, an army under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his prime miniſter, Cardinal Ximenſe.—The wonted good fortune of this officer did not, at this juncture deſert him. He had maintained a correſpondence with ſome of the people of Oran; &amp; when the Moors ſallied out to attack the Spaniards, their perfidious coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen ſhut the gates againſt them. Ximenſe killed four thouſand of the barbarians, and ſet at liberty ſixteen thouſand Chriſtian ſlaves.—The Algerines, during near two hundred years made frequent but unſucceſsful attempts to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it. In 1708, they retook it. In June, 1732, a Spaniſh army was landed not far from Oran. The Turkiſh troops and the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants were ſeized with a panic, and abandoned their fortifications without any reſiſtance. The Moors not long after attacked it with great fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but were finally repulſed, with much
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:033747_0086_0FF9172D2A66A510"/>
ſlaughter. The Spaniards continued in quiet poſſeſſion of it until the year 1791, when the Algerines went with a ſtrong force againſt it, under the command of Alli Bey of <hi>Maſcara.</hi> After a ſiege of ſeveral days, they withdrew their troops, having received much damage.—In 1792, the Dey of Algiers, and the King of Spain having agreed upon terms, very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventageous to the former, Oran was given up to the Algerines, and is ſtill in their poſſeſſion. During the ſixty years, the Spaniards had this place in their poſſeſſion; their ſoldiers kept continually deſerting. The Algerines uſed the greateſt economy to prevent thoſe at Oran, from knowing how the deſerters fared. By this means they were daily adding to their number of ſlaves, as the ſoldiers ſuppoſed they would be at liberty, if they deſerted to their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy. But contrary to every law of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, aſſoon as they were in the hands of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerines, they were made ſlaves, and deprived of the little liberty they enjoyed while under the Banner, of his Catholic Majeſty.</p>
                     <p>In this ſituation, were about five hundred of them, when I left Algiers. The King of Spain it cannot be reaſonably expected, will pay a ſum of money to ranſom people who deſerted from his ſervice, and by that means involved themſelves in this predicament, therefore they have no hopes of relief till death. There is a ſtory that the Dey, in one of his letters to the King of Spain, deſired to know if he intended to redeem thoſe ſlaves from Oran. To which
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:033747_0087_0FF9173009A5E110"/>
the King replied, that, if the Dey would ſalt them in barrels, he would purchaſe them at the price of ſalted beef.</p>

Previous to the beginning of the ſixteenth century, Algiers had experienced a variety of revolutions, in the form of its government, which does not come within the line of this ſhort ſketch to diſcribe. But there happened,
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:033747_0090_0FF917392110EF70"/>
a very ſudden revolution about that time, which hath made their hiſtory worthy of more attention, as it was the means of rendering the States of Barbary very formidable to the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans.

Aristotle, Strabo, Homer, recommended its wines; the firſt of whom, and Epicurus read lectures here.</note> who were known by the names of Hayradin, and Horuc, being prompted by a reſtleſs and enterpriſing ſpirit, forſook the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their father, went immediately to ſea, &amp; joined a gang of pirates, who made ſome of the ports of Barbary, the places of their rendezvous. They ſoon diſtinguiſhed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by the activity of their unparrelleled villianies, and in a ſhort time they became maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of a ſmall brigantine, mounting 14 ſix pounders by means of which, they ſupported their infamous and cruel piracies, with ſuch great ſucceſs, that in a few years they had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their command a fleet of twelve gallies, and many other veſſels of leſs force. Horuc, (the elder brother, who was afterwards called Barbaroſſa, by reaſon of the red color of his beard,) was Admiral of this fleet, and Hayra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din the younger brother, was ſecond in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. By their predatory conduct, their names ſoon became dreadful, and infamous

from the Straits of Gibraltar to thoſe of the Dardanelles.</p>
                     <p>Two famous caſtles defending the gulf of Lapanto, and the narrow ſtreight called the Helleſpont, which is here two miles over, and the key as it were to Conſtantinople; the one on the ſide of Europe, and the other on that of Aſia. The former was anciently called Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos, and the latter Abidos. In 1656, the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians paſſed through with their fleets between theſe forts, and drove that of the Turks on ſhore. Here all veſſels coming from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chipelago are examined. Not far from hence namely off Lapanto, the Venetians gained a conſiderable victory over the Turkiſh fleet.</p>
                     <p>As their power encreaſed, their ambitious views extended with a ſtill greater rapidity; for while they were acting as pirates, and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, they arrogated the ideas, and acquired the talents of, Conquerers. The prizes which they took on the coaſts of Spain, France, and Italy, they often carried into the ports of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary. The ſituation of theſe harbors being ſo very commodious for the ſecurity of their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſairs; and to add to this convenience, their vicinity to the greateſt commercial ports at that time in Chriſtendom, raiſed an ambitious deſire in the breaſt of thoſe infamous pirates, for an eſtabliſhment in that country. For ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing this project, an opportunity ſoon preſented itſelf, which the brothers, did not ſuffer to paſs unimproved. The King of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers, at this time, who was called Eutemi,
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:033747_0092_0FF91744A5EC4850"/>
having made ſeveral unſucceſsful attempts to gain poſſeſſion of a fort. which was built not far from his capital, by the Spaniſh Governors of Oran, applied to Barbaroſſa for aſſiſtance. The villain as may be ſuppoſed gladly accepted the propoſal, and left the fleet under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his brother Hayradin. He then marched with five thouſand men to Algiers, and was received with all the honors due to the commander in chief of ſuch an army, by the Algerines, who ſuppoſed him come to their aſſiſtance, not having the leaſt ſuſpicion of his baſe deſigns. His ambitious deſires of becoming great among the inhabitants of that part of the globe, had now an opportunity of being put in execution, and every thing ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to promiſe him ſucceſs. This great force had given him the command of the City, and indeed every thing ſeemed to favour the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petration of his diabolical plot. He therefore murdered ſecretly the monarch, who had ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited his aſſiſtance. and whom he had come to aſſiſt, and proclaimed himſelf king in his ſtead. He eſtabliſhed the authority which he had uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, by arts ſuited to the genius of the people whom he had to govern; for his liberality to thoſe who favored his promotion, was without bounds, and to thoſe whom he had any reaſon to miſtruſt, that wiſhed to oppoſe his authority his cruelties were no leſs unbounded. With his fleets, which reſembled the armaments of a great monarch, rather than the ſquadrons of a pirate, he continued to infeſt the coaſts of
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:033747_0093_0FF9174660119C28"/>
Spain and Italy, for by this time he had increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the number of his corſairs to upwards of 50 armed veſſels. The repeated and cruel devaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of his corſairs upon thoſe coaſts, obliged Charles the Vth, about the begining of his reign, to furniſh the Marquis de Comares, who was then Governor of Oran, with a ſufficient number of troops to attack him. That officer executed his commiſſion with ſuch ſpirit and reſolution, that the forces of Babaroſſa were vanquiſhed in ſeveral encounters, and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was ſhut up in Tremeſen, where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained blockaded for ſeveral months, and was at laſt fortunately ſlain, as he was attempting to make his eſcape. His brother Hayradin, who was likewiſe known by the name of Barbaroſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa, aſſumed the Algerine ſceptre. For ſome time he carried on his naval robberies with the utmoſt vigour, and on the continent of Africa, he even extended his conqueſts. But perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at length that the Moors and Arabs never ſubmitted to his deſpotic mandates, but with the utmoſt reluctance, and being apprehenſive leaſt his continual depredations would one day draw upon him the arms of the Chriſtians, he put his dominions under the protection of the grand Seignior, from whom he received a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient body of Turkiſh ſoldiers, for his ſecurity againſt his foreign as well as domeſtic enemies.</p>
                     <p>The infamy, (or, as Doctor Robertſon ſee proper to call it, the <hi>ſame</hi>) of his exploits daily increaſed, till at length <hi>Solyman,</hi> approving of
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:033747_0094_0FF8C4FD71BB3B50"/>
his conduct offered him the command of the Turkiſh fleet; and on the other hand, Hayra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din, juſtly dreading the fatal conſequences, which might ariſe from the tyranny of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers over the Algerines, ſolicited the protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the grand ſeignior. This was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately granted, and Hayradin himſelf appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Baſhaw, or vice roy of Algiers; by the means of which he received ſuch numerous reinforcements from Turkey, that the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Algerines durſt not make the leaſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, and were now under the woeful neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of reſigning their perſons, and property to the will of this deſpotic prince. Excluſive of thoſe Turks who were ſent him by the grand ſeignior as ſoldiers, ſuch numbers flocked to him, voluntarily, that he was not only capable in a conſiderable degree of annoying the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians with his corſairs at ſea, but alſo of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Moors, and Arabs in ſubjection at home. About this time he began the foundation of the mole, which I have before deſcribed. Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radin had by this time rendered himſelf dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not only by the Arabs, and Moors, but alſo by the maritime chriſtian powers, eſpecially by the Spaniards. The vice roy ſailed not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Grand Seignior with his ſucceſs, who being much pleaſed with his proceedings, furniſhed him with a freſh ſuppy of money, by means of which he was enabled to build thoſe ſorts and batteries before mentioned. The Sultan, in the mean time, either out of a ſenſe of the ſervices of Hayradin, or perhaps being

jealous leaſt he ſhould make himſelf indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, or more probably, both, to prevent the one, and reward the other, raiſed him to the important dignity of Baſhaw of the empire, and to ſucceed him as Baſhaw of Algiers, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, a Sardinian renegado, who was known by the name of Haſſan Aga, or General Haſſan the word Aga in Arabec ſignifying a general.</p>
                     <p>This new Baſhaw immediately on taking poſſeſſion of his new government, began to purſue his ravages, on the coaſts of Spain, and Italy with greater fury than <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> any of his predeceſſors had done, he even extended them to the eccleſiaſtical ſtate, and other parts of Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did not eſcape his rapine. Theſe proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings greatly alarmed, Pope Paul 3d who exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the emperor Charles 5th to ſend a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful fleet to ſuppreſs thoſe diabolical repeated piracies: and leaſt ſomething might be wanting to render this daring enterprize ſucceſsful, his holineſs publiſhed a bull, wherein a plenary ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of ſins, and the crown of martyrdom, were promiſed to all thoſe who fell in battle or were made ſlaves. The emperor, needed no incitement on his part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he therefore ſet ſail at the head of a powerful fleet, which conſiſted of one hundred and twenty three large ſhips, and twenty gallies of different ſizes, having on board thirty thouſand well diciplined troops, with an immenſe quantity of arms and ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition. The reduction of Algiers was ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently inevitable at this time, that many of the young nobility, and gentlemen attended
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:033747_0096_0FF9174C57744D90"/>
this expedition as volunteers, and among theſe were many knights of Malta, remarkable for their valour againſt the enemies of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Many ladies of birth and character attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Charles; A vaſt number of the officers and ſoldiers, took their wives and children with them, intending to ſettle in Barbary, after the conqueſt was finiſhed.</p>
                     <p>About the beginning of October, A. D. 1541, they arrived off the harbor. The ſight of ſuch a prodigious armament threw the Algerines into the utmoſt conſternation as their city was ſurrounded only by a wall, with ſcarce any out works, and their whole garriſon conſiſted of only eight hundred Turks, and ſix thouſand Moors, who were chiefly without fire arms, and poorly diſciplined and accoutred; the reſt of their forces being diſperſed in different pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of the kingdom, to levy the uſual tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute on the Arabs and Moors. The Spaniards landed their forces without any oppoſition whatever, and immediately built a large fort on a hill about a mile to the eaſtward of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, under the cannon of which they encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The city at this time being dependant on one ſpring for its water, which was one mile from the walls and the Spaniards, having di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted its courſe, they were now reduced to the utmoſt diſtreſs. Haſſan received a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons from Charles, to ſurrender at diſcretion, on pain of being put to the ſword with all his garriſon if he refuſed. The herald was order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to extol the vaſt power of the emperor, both
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:033747_0097_0FF9174ECDB71BC0"/>
by ſea &amp; land, and to exhort him to return to the Chriſtian religion. To this Haſſan replied, that <hi>he muſt be a madman, who would pretend to adviſe an enemy, and that the perſon adviſed, would act ſtill more madly ſhould he take counſel of ſuch an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſer.</hi> He was, however upon the point of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendering the city, when he received intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that the forces belonging to the weſtern government were in full march towards the place; upon which it was determined to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it, to the utmoſt. In the mean time, Charles being reſolved upon a general aſſault, kept up a cannonade without intermiſſion, upon the town, which from the weak defence made by the garriſon, he looked upon as already in his poſſeſſion. But while the Divan were delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating on the moſt proper means of obtaining an honourable capitulation, a mad prophet, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by a multitude of people, entered the aſſembly, and foretold the deſtruction of the Spaniards before the end of the moon, exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the inhabitants to hold out till that time. This prediction was ſoon accompliſhed in a very ſurpriſing and unexpected manner; for on the 28th of October 1541, a dreadful ſtorm of rain, hail and wind, aroſe from the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, attended with violent ſhocks of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, and a diſmal and univerſal darkneſs both by ſea and land; ſo that the ſun, moon, and elements, ſeemed to combine together for the deſtruction of the Spaniards. Eighty ſix ſhips, and fifteen gallies, were deſtroyed in that one night, with all their crews, and mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:033747_0098_0FF91752EF79EE40"/>
ſtores, and the Algerines ſay in leſs than half an hour, by which the army on ſhore was deprived of all means of ſubſiſtance. Their camp alſo, which ſpread itſelf along the plain, under cover of the cannon of their fort, was laid quite under water by the dreadful tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents which deſcended from the neighboring hills. Many of the troops were cut to pieces by the Moors, and Arabs by trying to remove into ſome better ſituation; while ſeveral gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and other veſſels, endeavouring to gain ſome neighboring creeks along the coaſt, were immediately plundered, and their crews maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred by the inhabitants. Next morning; Charles, to his utmoſt aſtoniſhment, beheld the ſea covered with the fragments of his ſhips, and the bodies of men, horſes, and other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſwimming upon the waves, the ſight of which ſo diſheartened him, that abandoning his tents, artillery, and all his heavy baggage, to the enemy, he marched at the head of his army in the greateſt precipitation and diſorder towards Cape Mallabux, in order to re-embark, on board thoſe veſſels, which had out-weather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſtorm. But Haſſan, was not an idle ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator all this while, for he had ſo narrowly watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the motion of the Spaniards, that he allowed them juſt time enough to get to the ſhore, when he ſallied out &amp; attacked them with the greateſt fury, in the midſt of their hurry to get into the ſhips. The Spaniards, however made an obſtinate reſiſtance, and a very bloody carnage continued for about two hours, when they
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:033747_0099_0FF9184C1BCC8038"/>
were over-powered, and obliged to retreat to their boats, the whole number of which was not capable of carrying one quarter of them. Haſſan purſued them to their boats, and killed a vaſt number, and brought away a ſtill greater number of captives; after which he returned in triumph to Algiers. The prophet Yuſef, who had foretold the deſtruction of the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, was ſoon after this declared the deliverer of his country, and had a conſiderable gratuity decreed him, with the liberty of exerciſing his prophetic functions unmoleſted. It was not long however, before a ſtrong oppoſition was made againſt him, by ſome of the interpreters of the law, by remonſtrating to the Dey, how ridiculous and ſcandalous, it was to their nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to aſcribe its deliverance to a poor fortune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teller, which had been obtained by the fervent prayers of an eminent ſaint of their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. The Baſhaw, and his Divan, ſeemed, out of policy, to give way to this laſt notion; yet the impreſſion which the prediction of Yu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſef, and its accompliſhments had made upon the minds of the common people, proved too ſtrong to eradicated; ſince which the ſpirit of divination and conjuring, has got into ſuch credit among them, that not only their great ſtatesmen, but their prieſts, and ſantoons, have applied themſelves to that ſtudy, and dignified it with the name of the Revelations of Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met.</p>
                     <p>The Spaniards had ſcarcely reached their ſhips, when a ſecond ſtorm attacked them, in
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:033747_0100_0FF917D20FB9C1C0"/>
which a vaſt vaſt number more of them periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. One veſſel in particular, with ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſoldiers, and three hundred ſeamen on board, ſunk, in the preſence of Charles, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a poſſibility of ſaving one man. At length with great difficulty the ſurvivors reached the port of Bujeyah, a ſmall port on the coaſt of Barbary, which lies about thirty five leagues to the eaſtward of Algiers, and was at this time poſſeſſed by Spain. They remained here only till the ſixteenth of November, and then ſet ſail for Carthagena, (in Spain,) at which place they arrived on the 25th of the ſame Month. Upwards of one hundred and twenty ſhips and gallies, were loſt, in this unfortunate expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with above three hundred officers, and eight thouſand ſoldiers, beſides mariners, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive of thoſe deſtroyed by the enemy on their re-embarkation, or periſhed in the laſt ſtorm, and thoſe who were made ſlaves. The number of priſoners was now ſo great, that ſome of them were ſold, by the Algerines, by way of contempt, for an <hi>Onion</hi> per head!</p>
                     <p>The Spaniards were never able to annoy the Algerines, in any conſiderable degree, after this time. In the year 1555, Salab Baiſe, ſucceſſor to Haſſan, attacked the city of Bujeyah, and ſoon made himſelf maſter of it, though not without an obſtinate reſiſtance from the Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iards, and great ſlaughter on both ſides. Salab Baiſe now augmented the number of Chriſtian ſlaves, to thirty one thouſand. The next year, this commander's ambition being raiſed
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:033747_0101_0FF917D9CD9D13B0"/>
with the ſucceſs he met at Bujeyah, he ſet out upon a new expedition, ſuppoſed to be againſt Oran, but was ſcarce got out of the city, when he was attacked with the plague which made its appearance in his groin, and fortunately carried him off, in twenty four hours. The plague at this time raging very violently in the city, and among the troops, the ſoldiery im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately elected a Corſican renegado, Haſſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Corſo, in his ſtead, in order to execute the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended expedition againſt Oran. He accepted the Baſhawſhip with much difficulty, diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a meſſenger at the ſame time to acquaint the porte, with what had happened, and marched his army againſt Oran, they had ſcarcely commenced their hoſtilities againſt that place, when orders were received from the porte, expreſſly forbiding Haſſan-Corſo to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the ſiege; or, if it was begun enjoining him immediately to raiſe it, which he did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. This officer had enjoyed his digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty but four months, when a new Baſhaw, Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kelli, arrived from Conſtantinople, as his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor. The Algerines reſolved not to admit him; but by the treachery of the Levantine ſoldiers, he at laſt entered. He immediately ordered Corſo, to be thrown upon the hooks which are faſtened in the walls of city, one of which catching him by the ribs of his ſide, he hung in this horrid agony, three days before he expired. Tekelli, was inhumanly murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhortly after, under the cupola of a ſaint, by Yuſef Calabres, a favourite renegade, of
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:033747_0102_0FF8C58A1B0A39D8"/>
Haſſan-Corſo. The murderer was immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly choſen in his ſtead, but died of the plague, ſix days after his election. Yuſef's ſucceſſor, was Haſſan, the ſon of Hayradin, Barbaroſſa. Not long after, the Spaniards undertook an expedition againſt Moſtagan under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the court D'Alcandela, but were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly defeated, the commander ſlain, and twelve thouſand men taken priſoners. Haſſan having diſobliged his ſubjects, they ſent him in irons to Conſtantinople, and two Turkiſh of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers ſupplied his place. Haſſan was cleared, but Achmet was appointed a new Baſhaw.—Immediately upon his arrival at Algiers, he ſent the two deputy-Baſhaws to Conſtantinople. where they were beheaded. Achmet died in four months after; and Haſſan was ſent a third time Vice-Roy to Algiers, Soon after his arrival he engaged in the ſeige of Marſalqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, (a town of Algiers, ſituate on the Barbary coaſt of Africa, lying oppoſite to Oran,) which at this time, was poſſeſſed by the Spaniards; and ſituated at a ſmall diſtance from Oran. He planted the Ottoman ſtandard ſeveral times upon the walls, which the Spaniards as often diſlodged; and Haſſan was finally obliged to raiſe the ſeige, after great ſlaughter on both ſides.</p>
                     <p>In the year 1567, Haſſan was again recalled to Conſtantinople. His ſucceſſor, Mahomet, incorporated the Janiſaries and Levantine Turks together. Thus he put an end to their diſſentions, and the foundation of the Algerine
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:033747_0103_0FF917EB36C57FE8"/>
independency on the porte, was now laid. He erected ſeveral fortifications which he intended to render impregnable.</p>
                     <p>About this time, one Juan Gaſcon, an intre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid Spaniard, formed a deſign of deſtroying the whole piratic navy, as they lay in the bay, by ſetting them on fire in the night. He was furniſhed by Philip the 2d, with veſſels, fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, and mariners, for the execntion of his plan. He failed for Algiers in the begining of October, when the greateſt part of the Corſairs lay at anchor in the bay; and advanced near enough to view them, undiſcovered. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, unperceived by any, came to the mole, and diſpatched his men, with their fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works but theſe being ſo badly mixed, that they could not be kindled. Gaſcon now find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf diſcovered, and in the utmoſt danger got his ſhips under way with all poſſible haſte, and ſtood to ſea; but was purſued, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, and brought back a priſoner. Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met immediately cauſed a gibbet to be erected on the ſpot where Gaſcon landed, and hung him by the feet upon a hook, with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion tied to his toes. He had been ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this ſituation, but a ſhort time, when the captain who made him priſoner, and ſeveral other officers, interceeded ſo ſtrongly in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, that he was taken down, and put under the care of a chriſtian ſurgeon. A few days after, it being reported that it was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon talk and belief in Spain, that the Alge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines durſt not hurt a hair of Guſcon's head,
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:033747_0104_0FF917F1A969F1A8"/>
he was carried to the top of the execution wall, and thrown down. In his fall a hook catched him by the belly, which tore out, ſo he fell to the bottom and was daſhed to pieces.</p>
                     <p>Mahomet was ſucceeded by Ochali, a rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gado, who ſubdued the kingdom of Tunis. It remained ſubject to the baſhaw of Algiers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the year 1586, a Baſhaw of Tunis, was then appointed by the grand Seignior.</p>
                     <p>Algiers continued to be governed by the Turkiſh Vice Roys or Baſhaws, till the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſeventeenth century. The Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Janiſaries, and Militia becoming powerful enough at laſt, to ſuppreſs the tyrannic ſway of theſe Baſhaws a deputation of ſome of their chief members was ſent to Conſtantinople to complain of their rapacity. They repreſented to the miniſtry, how much more honorable it would be for the grand Seignior to permit them to chuſe their own Dey, or Governor, from among themſelves, whoſe intereſt it would be to ſee that the revenue of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was rightly applied in keeping up its forces complete, and in ſupplying all other exigencies of the ſtate, without any further trouble or expence to the porte, than that of allowing them his protection. The Divan elected a Dey from among themſelves. A new ſet of laws was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled, and they made ſeveral regulations, for the better ſupport of this new government. The ſubſequent altercations that frequently hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened between the Baſhaws &amp; Deys, the one for
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:033747_0105_0FF917F683962AC8"/>
endeavouring to recover their former power, and the other to curtail it, cauſed ſuch frequent complaints and diſcontents at the Ottoman court, as made them ſometimes repent of their compliance.</p>
                     <p>The Spaniards made another attempt upon Algiers, in the year 1601, but by contrary winds their fleet was driven back, ſo that this time they came off without loſs. Such num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Moors, being expelled from Spain in the year 1609, that they flocked to Algiers in abundance; and many of them being able ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, they undoubtedly contributed to make the Algerine fleet ſo formidable as it ſoon became. <note n="*" place="bottom">The Moors are deſcended from the Saracens, who at the end of the 7th Century, poſſeſſed themſelves of the fineſt kingdoms of Aſia and Africa and not content with the immenſe region that formerly compoſed great part of the Aſſyrian Perſian, Macedonian, and Roman Empires, croſſed the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean ravaged Spain, and eſtabliſhed themſelves in its ſouthern pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces. They were ſuperior to all their contemporaries in arts and arms, and held poſſeſſion of the throne nearly 300 years. Learning flouriſhed in Spain, while the reſt of Europe was buried in Ignorance and barbarity. A ſeries of civil wars continued to depopulate Spain until about the year 1492, when all the Kingdoms of Spain (Portugal excepted) were united by the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of Ferdinand, King of Arragon, and Iſabella, the heireſs, and afterwards King of Caſtile. They took Grenada, and in the beginning of the 17th century, the Moors and Jews who would not become Converts to the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian faith, were to the number of one hundred and ſeventy thouſand families, driven out of Spain. This depopulation of Spain of Labourers, Manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers and Seamen, added greatly to the internal growth and ſtrength of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers, as well as to the increaſe of its navy.</note> In 1616, their naval force conſiſted of forty large ſhips, beſide Xebecs, row-galley's &amp;c. their Admiral ſhip at this time was upwards of five hundred tons burthen. Their fleet was divided into two ſquadrons, one of eighteen ſail, was ſtationed off the port of Malaga; and the other
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:033747_0106_0FF917FD9958AD90"/>
off the Cape Santa Maria, between Liſbon and Seville; both of which annoyed Chriſtian ſhips &amp; plundered both Engliſh &amp; French, with whom they pretended to be in friendſhip, as well as Spaniards and Portugueſe with whom they were at war.</p>
                     <p>The Algerines were now become formidable to the European powers. The Spaniards who were moſt expoſed to danger, ſolicited the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of England, the Pope and other ſtates. The French however were the firſt who dared to ſhew their reſentment at the perfidious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>havior of theſe miſcreants; and in the year 1617, M. Beauleau was ſent againſt them with a fleet of fifty men of war. He defeated their fleet, and took two of their veſſels. Their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral ſunk his own ſhip rather than fall into the hands of the enemy. The Engliſh ſent a ſquadron of men of war againſt Algiers in the year 1620, but they returned without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſuſtaining any material damage. The Algerines daily becoming more inſolent and daring, openly defied all the European powers, the Dutch only excepted, to whom, in 1625 they ſent a propoſal, that if they would ſit out twenty ſail of ſhips in the following year, upon any ſervice againſt the Spaniards, the corſairs would join them with ſixty ſail. In 1626, the Cologlies ſeized on the Citadel, and nearly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed their deſign, of making themſelves maſters of the city. The Turks and Renega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, attacked them with great fury, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated them with terrible ſlaughter. Vaſt
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:033747_0107_0FF918067778E998"/>
numbers were beheaded, and their heads thrown in heaps upon the walls of the city.—The Algerines, and other ſtate of Barbary, threw off their dependence on the porte, in the year 1623. Sultan Amurath 4th, had been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to make a truce with the Emperor Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand 2d; for the term of twenty five years, and as this put a ſtop to the piratical trade of the Algerines, they reſolved, that whoever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to be at peace with them, muſt, ſeparately apply to their own government. They made prizes of ſeveral merchant ſhips, belonging to the powers at peace with the porte. At Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroon <note n="*" place="bottom">A town of A ſiatic Turkey, ſituate on the coaſt of Aſia Minor. It is the port to on of Aleppo, with which the Engliſh and Dutch carry on a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable trade.</note> they ſeized a Dutch ſhip, and polacre; in this port they even ventured on ſhore, the Turkiſh aga and inhabitants had abandoned the town on their approach, they therefore plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered all the magazines and ware houſes, and ſet them on fire. About this time Louis 13th, undertook to built a fort on their coaſt, inſtead of one formerly built at the Marſilians, and which had been demoliſhed. This, after much difficulty, he accompliſhed; and it was called the Baſtion of France; but the ſituation being found inconvenient, the French purchaſed the port of La Calle, and obtained liberty to trade with the Arabs and Moors. In the mean time, the Ottoman court, was ſo much embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed with a Perſian war, that they had no lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:033747_0108_0FF9180C5B9FCED0"/>
to check the Algerine piracies. The Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier, and other courtiers, took this opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to compound matters with the Algerines, and to get a ſhare of the prizes, which were very conſiderable. A ſevere reprimand ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compined with threats, was ſent them, merely for ſake of form. They replied, that "they deſerved to be indulged in theſe depredations, as they were the only bulwark againſt the Chriſtian powers, and in particular, againſt the Spaniards, the ſworn enemies to the Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem name" they added, that "if they ſhould pay a punctilious regard to all who could pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe liberty to trade with the Ottoman em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, they "would have nothing to do but ſet ſire to their ſhipping, and turn camel-drivers."</p>
                     <p>The Algerines proſecuted their piracies with impunity, to the terror and diſgrace of Chriſtendom, till the year 1652; when a French fleet being driven to Algiers accidentally, the admiral thought proper to demand a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe of all the Captives belonging to his nation indiſcriminately, which the Dey refuſing to comply with the Frenchman without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ceremony carried off the Turkiſh viceroy, and his Cadi or Judge, who were juſt arrived from the porte, with all their equipage and retinue. By way of repriſal the Algerines ſurpriſed the Baſtion of France, already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and carried off ſix hundred inhabitants, with all their effects. Sixteen galleys and galliots were ſitted out ſoon after by the Alge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines, under the command of Alli Penchinin.
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:033747_0109_0FF9181119E0C950"/>
The chief deſign of this armament was againſt the treaſure of Loretto in Italy; but being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by contrary winds from obtaining their deſire, they made a deſcent on Puglia in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Naples; where the whole territory of Necotra, ſuffered by their ravages, and a vaſt number of captives were carried to Algiers. They then ſteered towards Dalmatia, &amp; ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Adriatic, loading themſelves with immenſe treaſure. Such ravages greatly alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Venetians, who immediately ſent admiral Capello, with twenty eight ſail of ſhips againſt them, with expreſs orders to burn, ſink or take, every Barbary corſair he might meet with, either at ſea, or in the Ottoman harbours, agreeable to their late treaty with the Porte. The Rais Baſhaw being at ſea at this time with a Turkiſh fleet, in order to drive the Malteſe and Florentine cruiſers from the Archipelago, and being informed that the Algerine ſquadron was very near, ſent expreſs orders to the Alge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine admiral to come to his aſſiſtance. Pinchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nin readily complied and ſet ſail; but on his way, he fell in with Capello, who chaſed him to Valona, a ſea port belonging to the Turkiſh empire; but the Turkiſh governor refuſing to turn out the pirates, according to the articles of peace between the Ottoman court &amp; Venice, Capello, was obliged to content himſelf with watching their motion, for a conſiderable time. At length Pinchinin ventured out, and a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate engagement enſued, which continued for about four hours, with the moſt determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:033747_0110_0FF9181831028A10"/>
obſtinacy on both ſides, at laſt Pinchinin fled, and was purſued by Capello; but the pirates ſhips ſailing faſter than their enemy, they made their eſcape. Five of the Algerine ſhips being diſabled they fell into the hands of the Venetians. In this action the pirates loſt, in killed, one thouſand five hundred men, Turks, and Chriſtian ſlaves, and one thouſand ſix hundred galley ſlaves ſet at liberty by Capel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo. The pirates, after this defeat, returned to Valona, where they were again watched by the Venetians, but the latter had not been long at his old ſtation, before a letter was ſent him from his court, deſiring him not to make any farther attempts at that time, leſt it might be the occaſion of a rupture with the Porte. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pello being forced to ſubmit; he reſolved to take his leave of them in ſuch a manner, as he tho't they deſerved; obſerving how their tents &amp; equipage were drawn along the ſhore, he kept firing among them, while ſome ſhips were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched to attack their ſquadron. They towed out ſixteen of the pirates gallies, with all their cannon and ſtores. A ball from one of the Venetian gallies having ſtruck a Turkiſh moſque, the whole action was conſidered as an inſult upon the grand Seignior. To conceal this orders were given to Capello to ſink all the ſhips he had taken from the Algerines, except the Admiral; which was to be laid up at Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice as a trophy. Capello received a ſevere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primand from his court, and the Venetians were obliged to pay to the porte, five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:033747_0111_0FF9181EC3B13C78"/>
thouſand ducats, by way of attonement. The news of this defeat, filled Algiers, with rage and confuſion. They immediately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the porte, for an order, that the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians who were ſettled in the Levant, (the eaſt part of the Mediterranean ſea,) ſhould make their loſs good. But the grand ſeignior refuſed to comply with this, and left them to repair their loſſes in the beſt manner they could. The pirates however ſoon recovered their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſtrength, being able at the end of two years to ſend a fleet of ſixty five ſail to ſea.</p>
                     <p>The Algerines having committed ſuch grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous outrages on the coaſts of Provence and Languedoc, that Louis the 14th, was provoked in the year 1682, to ſend a very, large ſleet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, under the command of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis du Queſne, vice Admiral of Prance. He arrived off Algiers in Auguſt, and gave the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſuch a furious bombarding and cannonading, that in a ſhort time, it was greatly damaged, and the great Moſque battered down. The wind ſhifting on a ſudden obliged du Queſne to return to Toulon. The Algerines by way of repriſal, ſent a number of Corſairs to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence where they committed the moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful outrages, bringing away a vaſt number of captives; upon which Louis ordered another armament, againſt them the next year. Du Queſne anchored before Algiers in May 1683, where he was joined by the Marquis d'Affran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville with five more ſhips, it being reſolved to bombard the town next morning, they accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:033747_0112_0FF91824B12129E8"/>
commenced the action in the morning, and threw one hundred bombs into it, which did terrible execution, while the Algerines diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged ſeveral hundreds of cannon againſt the aſſailants without doing any material damage. On the following night great numbers of bombs were again thrown into the city, which nearly demoliſhed the Dey's palace, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral great edifices; ſome veſſels were ſunk in the harbor and ſeveral batteries diſmounted.</p>
                     <p>The Dey and ſoldiery being greatly alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the terrible havock, ſued for peace.—As a preliminary, the French demanded all chriſtian captives who had been taken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the French flag, which was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately granted, and one hundred and forty two perſons were directly given up, with a promiſe of ſending on board the reſt as ſoon as they could be brought from the different parts of the country. Du Queſne ſent his commiſſary general and one of his engineers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the town; with expreſs orders to inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſurrender of all French captives without exception, together with all the effects which they had taken from the French; and that their Admiral Mezomorto, and Rais Alli, one of their captains, ſhould be given as hoſtages. The Dey being embarraſſed with this laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, he aſſembled the Divan, and acquainted them with it. This threw Mezomorto into a violent paſſion; he told the aſſembly, that the ruin of Algiers, was occaſioned by the coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice of thoſe who had the helm; that for his
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:033747_0113_0FF9182A346E6CA0"/>
part, he would never conſent to deliver up any thing which they had taken from the French. He immediately acquainted the ſoldiery with thoſe new demands, and of what had paſſed in the aſſembly; which ſo exaſperated them, that they maſſacred the Dey that very night, and the next day choſe Mezomorto in his ſtead. This being done, all the articles of peace which had been made were deſtroyed, and hoſtilities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed with greater fury than ever. Du Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne now kept pouring in ſuch volleys of bombs, that the greateſt part of the city was almoſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to ruins, in leſs than three days; the numbers of ſlain were ſo great that their blood run in rivulets along the ſtreets. Mezomorto was unmoved by all theſe diſaſters, but had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grown deſperate and furious, he ſought only how to wreak his revenge on the enemy. He cauſed all the French in the city to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanely maſſacred, and not contented with this, he ordered their Conſul to be faſtened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live to the mouth of a mortar, from which he was ſhot away againſt their navy. Du Queſne was ſo exaſperated, with this piece of barbarity that he did not leave Algiers till he had utterly deſtroyed all their fortifications, and ſhipping; and had reduced the city to a heap of ruins.—The Algerines ſoon after this, ſent an embaſſy into France, begging in the moſt abject terms for peace; which Louis readily granted. This bombardment ſo far humbled the Algerines, that they condeſcended to enter into a treaty with England which took place in the year 1686.

With a conciſe account of the expedition of the Spaniards in 1775, I ſhall cloſe this chapter.</p>
                     <p>On the 23d or June, 1775, a ſleet conſiſting of ſix ſhips of the line, twelve frigates, and thirty three other armed veſſels ſet ſail from Carthagena, in Spain, to attack Algiers. The troops which were on board amounted to twenty four thouſand four hundred and forty ſeven men, including calvalry, infantry, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines, and ſix hundred deſerters deſtined to ſerve as workmen. They were commanded by the count O'Reilly, a perſonal favourite of the late king of Spain. For the land ſervice they had an hundred and ſeventy ſix pieces of artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, mortars, and howitzers, with a ſufficient quantity of military ſtores. They anchored in the bay of Algiers, on the 30th of June, and 1ſt of July. Next day a council was held, and the troops were ordered to hold themſelves in readineſs to diſembark on the enſuing morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by day break. But as the ſucceeding night was windy, and a ſwell had ſet in from the North, their orders were countermanded.—From this day, to the ſixth, there were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent councils, violent debates and nothing done. A quarrel broke out between O'Reilly and the Marquis de Romane, a Spaniſh major<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>general, who was killed in the ſubſequent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. On the ſixth, the principal officers were again aſſembled, to receive their ultimate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions. O'Reilly warned the army, that the cuſtom of the Algerines, was, to pretend a moſt violent attack, and to fly with precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:033747_0115_0FF918333AD86C30"/>
on the ſmalleſt reſiſtance, that they might draw the enemy into an ambuſcade. He cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the troops not to break their ranks, as nothing but the force of diſcipline could ſecure them againſt ſo active an enemy. The very error which they committed, and the ſnare into which they were betrayed, was pointed out of them, by O'Reilly. The army was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected (on their landing) to gain ſome heights, which were ſuppoſed requiſite to enſure ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs againſt Algiers. In the afternoon of the ſame day ſome ſhips of war were ordered to fire againſt three batteries a little to the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the city. This commiſſion was execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſo much laudable attention to the perſonal ſafety of the aſſailants, that their ſhot <hi>did not reach the ſhore,</hi> thoſe of one ſeventy four gun ſhip excepted, and not one of thoſe ſtruck either of the batteries. This dreadful Spaniſh attack ceaſed about ſunſet. Between eight &amp; nine thouſand men were put on board the boats the next morning at day break in order for landing. They advanced under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of their ſhips very near the coaſt. Not a perſon appeared to oppoſe them; <hi>but leſt they might be attacked, and for their own ſafety</hi> they <hi>returned on board the tranſports</hi> at ſeven o'clock in the morning. Not a ſingle ſhot was fired on either ſide during this whole day. On the 8th at day break, the ſhips were ſtationed to batter the different forts to the right and leſt of the place of diſembarkation, eight thouſand troops were put on board the boats; which
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:033747_0116_0FF9183B8C86DD08"/>
formed in ſix colums. The place of landing was about a league to the eaſtward of the city. Sixty or ſeventy thouſand Barbarians, of whom the greateſt part were cavalry, came in ſight, but did not attempt to oppoſe the landing of the Spaniards. The troops advanced into a cloſe country, which the Algerines had occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſmall parties. The light infantry and grenadiers of the Spaniards were ſoon repulſed, and the whole body fell into confuſion. In a very ſhort time they fled, leaving behind them a great number of killed and wounded. Part of a ſecond body of troops, who were juſt land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, added to the general confuſion. A third body had caſt up an entrenchment on ſhore, for the protection of the army. The Africans attacked it, but were driven back, with great laughter on both ſides. The Algemines attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them a ſecond time, driving before them vaſt numbers of camels which ſerved to ſhield them in ſome meaſure from the balls of the Spaniards. They advanced in this manner within a ſhort diſtance of the Spaniſh forces, when a ſharp engagement took place which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued about half an hour, the Spaniards were then put to flight, leaving behind them fifteen pieces of cannon, three howitzers, and all their dead and wounded, the latter were all put to the ſword, and the head of every Spaniard, whether dead or alive,) was ſtruck off—The Dey having offered a reward of ten Sequins for each head that ſhould be brought him. The Spaniſh accounts allow their loſs to be no
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:033747_0117_0FF9183D214FC948"/>
more than five hundred and ſeventy one men killed. The Algerines ſtate the loſs of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, to be nine thouſand five hundred and ſeven, and their own at about one thouſand two hundred. This latter ſtatement is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps nigher the truth than the former, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Algerines being ſcreened in a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable degree from the fire of their enemy, by the camels, whom they drove in front. The real amount of the loſs on either ſide is very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to determine, but one circumſtance is ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ident, that the bones of ſeveral thouſand Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards are laying above ground to this day, in the valley where they were ſlain, they not being allowed a burial by the Algerines.</p>

                     <p>NOTHING of any great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment happened after the ſecond of November 1793, (to which date I have already given an account) until the eleventh, when a courier ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from Alicant, in Spain, ſent by Col. Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phreys, the Ambaſſador from the United States for Algiers, to obtain the Deys permiſſion for him to come to Algiers, and make a peace with the regency. The Dey anſwered, that "he would not receive him, either to make peace nor to redeem the American Slaves, that he had been ſoliciting the American government, to ſend an ambaſſador to make a peace with the Regency for three years before ſucceſſively, that they had treated his propoſitions with
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:033747_0119_0FF8C593F018ED60"/>
neglect and indifference; that as he had a truce with the Dutch and Portugueſe; and had cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured ten ſail of American veſſels, and had a fair proſpect of capturing many more, he would not make a peace with them—that he made the truce with Portugal, for the purpoſe of having the ſtraits open for his veſſels to cruize in the Atlantic, for capturing American veſſels—that he could not be at peace with all nations at once."</p>
                     <p>At this dreadful news, we deſpaired of ever taſting the ſweets of liberty again. Here we expected to end our days in the moſt laborious ſlavery, pregnant with unutterable diſtreſs, in whoſe preſence reigns eternal horrors, and meagre famine leads its doleful train; where ſubjection adds to the weight of each curſt load, and the pain of the vaſſal is doubled, it ſpreads a gloom over the ſprightly face of nature, and dooms every pleaſure to the grave. Behold here the humane benevolent man; the reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able citizen, and affectionate parent—he who vindicated the ſacred cauſe of liberty, and ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſociety by inflexible honor. Behold him cruelly rent from the embraces of a beloved wife—from the arms of his infants—from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry object beneath the circling rays of the ſun, that could afford a gleam of momentary joy, and conſigned to chains and miſery! See him groaning under the burden impoſed on him; and ſtill bearing a heavier weight within. He ſilently wipes away the involuntary tear which rolls down his emaciated cheek, and ſtruggles
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:033747_0120_0FF9184718684698"/>
to ſuppreſs the riſing ſigh. Follow him when evening approaches, into his deſtined dungeon. Obſerve the ſettled melancholy which preys upon his haggared countenance—Reſtleſs and forlorn, when he lays himſelf down to ſleep, thought preſents to his tortured imagination the happy moments of love and liberty! He now gives free ſcope to his grief, and bewails his cruel deſtiny, the briny torrent guſhes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrained from his eyes, and moiſtens the ſtones on which his emacitated body is ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.—He exclaims, "O! happy, thrice happy days of former proſperity—my eyes behold no more the ineffable ſmiles of friendſhip or the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing face of love! All nature is a vale of horror—a howling waſte, and life has become a burden. Oh! my dear children—my dear wife, thoſe former happy days are gone forev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er." Overwhelmed with heart rending an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, the ſtupor of inſenſibility affords him a momentary alleviation.</p>
                     <p>On the 29th, a prize arrived, and ſhe prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the brig Minerva of New York, load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with wine, oil, fruit and marble, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Joſeph Ingraham, from Leghorn, bound to America. She was captured by the Alge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines, on the 25th, within ſeven or eight miles of Cape St. Sebaſtian. When the captors ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived they brought the crew of the ſaid brig. Seven more were now added to our number to participate in our diſtreſs, and partake with us the horrors of unſpeakable ſlavery, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moan the loſs of the bleſſing of liberty, drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:033747_0121_0FF917C9A4B41288"/>
out an unwelcome exiſtence of a ſlave, on Barbary's hoſtile coaſt, and to be perſecuted by the hands of mercileſs Mahometans, confined in dark and unwholeſome dungeons, and loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with galling irons, whoſe unrelenting taſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter raiſes the bloody ſcourge, and exalts the engine of inhuman barbarity. Vain and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs are our inceſſant ſupplications, our cries are loſt in air, and reſignation is our only an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote. Our accumulated wretchedneſs far ſurpaſſes the power of deſcription, bereft of every dawn of conſolation, filled with excruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating woe, we tremble, faint, and ſink under the preſſure of affliction. The moſt ſtriking portrait, though exhibited by the pencil of a Hogarth, however affecting to the imagination, fal's infinitely ſhort of the reality.</p>
                     <p>On the 23d of December, we were inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Mr. Skjolderbrand, the Sweediſh Conſul, that we were allowed a valuable ſupply from the United States; and that he had that day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived orders and money, to pay each captain, belonging to the United States of America, eight Spaniſh dollars per month; each mate, ſix, and all the reſt three dollars each. Our country alſo furniſhed us with a ſufficient quantity of cloathing, decent and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. This was happy news for us; for from the time of our being captured, to this day, we had been dragging out a miſerable exiſtence, ſcarce worth poſſeſſing, with no kind of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance except bread and vinegar, and water to drink. This generoſity of the United S.
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:033747_0122_0FF9184E812A1498"/>
to us their enſlaved countrymen was of ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable value. It was more precious for being unexpected. No nation of Chriſtendom had ever done the like for their ſubjects in our ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>
                     <p>The Republican government of the United States have ſet an example of humanity to all the governments of the world. Our relief was matter of admiration to mercileſs Barbarians. They viewed the American character from this time in the moſt exalted light. They ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, that, <hi>"Though we were ſlaves we were gentlemen,"</hi> that <hi>"the American people muſt be the beſt in the world to be ſo humane and generous to their countrymen in ſlavery."</hi> The goodneſs of my country I ſhall never forget. Our money would now enable us to purchaſe ſome kind of proviſion, that we might have ſomething to eat at night, when we went to the Bagnio, that gloomy manſion of horror and deſpair. But theſe avaricious ſons of rapine and plunder, would endeavor to extort this little relief out of our hands; and as they were not allowed to take it by force, they would endeavour to get it by fraud. For when we were in the Bagnio, and wiſhed to buy any kind of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, (as we were not allowed to go out after we had entered) theſe fraudulent wretches, would gladly go and purchaſe them for us (on condition of being well paid for their trouble) and they would tell us they gave double what they really did give. In this manner they cheated us out of one half our money. This
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:033747_0123_0FF9185340C43678"/>
ſupply was allowed us until the day of our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, with the addition of three quarters of a dollar per Month, for the ſeamen, the officers being allowed the ſame they were at firſt, with no addition.</p>
                     <p>Soon after receiving the above mentioned ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, and a letter from Col. David Humphreys, informing the American Captains of his arrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they wrote him the following letter..</p>

                           <p>I HAVE been favored by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of your joint letter, dated the 29th of December, and, as I am about to ſet out im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately for Liſbon, I ſhall be able to do little more than aſſure you that your memorials to Senate and Houſe of Repreſentatives of the United States ſhall be forwarded to them in the earlieſt and ſafeſt manner, poſſible. Having communicated to Meſſrs. Carmichael, and Short, your apprehenſion that the plague may again be introduced to Algiers, from the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent countries, where it is already ſaid to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail; we have not heſitated to concur with you in ſentiment, that in caſe of that dreadful event, it might be uſeful for you to have a houſe hired in the country; in order to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, by all human precautions, to prevent your falling victims to that terrible diſorder. Where upon Mr. Robert Montgomery, Conſul of the United States, at Alicant, has been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered, in caſe that dreadful event ſhould ſhould happen, to furniſh ſufficient money to pay for the hire of a houſe, in the manner and for the purpoſe you propoſe. This proviſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al arrangement to continue in force, until Mr. Montgomery ſhall receive ulterior inſtructions from the Government of the United States, for continuing or ſuſpending the ſame.</p>

I entreat you will be perſuaded, my dear and unfortunate countrymen, that I receive with great ſatiſfaction the marks of your approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of the honeſt, but ineffectual efforts I have made in your favour.

                     <p>P. S. Though I have repeatedly remarked, that it may perhaps, (for particular reaſons) be inexpedient for me to keep up a regular cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with you: yet it is proper I ſhould add, that I ſhall always be glad to hear from you; and that it may be particularly intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the government of our country, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive at the earlieſt poſſible period, all intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of importance. I ſhall therefore always be ready to communicate ſuch intelligence, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til ſome nearer, and better channel of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication can be eſtabliſhed.</p>
                     <p>This letter was accompanied by another from Mr. Montgomery, authoriſing the Swediſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul, to make the before-mentioned propoſal to the Dey, and to offer payment to the Regency, for the time of all Americans, that the Dey
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:033747_0128_0FF91867796EFCD8"/>
would be pleaſed to let go, to any garden, or houſe, to reſide until this dreadful ſtorm of mortality ſhould be over.</p>
                     <p>Accordingly when the plague ſpread its a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm in the city, Mr. Skjoldebrand went to the Dey with this propoſal, to which the execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſon of Iſhmael replied in words to this purpoſe, <hi>"Does the American Government ſuppoſe, I am going to do my work myſelf, when I have ſo many ſlaves; or do they think to make an Aſs of me, by hiring my ſlaves, to live in idleneſs. No while they have life, they ſhall work, and if they die with the plague, it will be my loſs, not theirs!"</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>About the firſt of February, 1794, ſeveral Americans were attacked with the ſmall pox. Of this epidemical diſeaſe, four of my country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men died in the courſe of the month, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, Samuel Milborne, chief mate of the ſhip Minerva, belonging to Philadelphia, Richard Wood, mate of the brig Olive Branch of Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth (N. H.) John Mott, mariner, of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer veſſel, and Thomas Furnace, Cabin boy, of the latter. A ſhort time after, the city was alarmed with the plague. This fatal and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious, diſorder, carried off many Americans, whom I ſhall name, in the liſt of Americans, (captured by the Algerines) in the latter part of this book. About the laſt of april, a Dutch Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral arrived in the bay, with four ſail of the line, and two frigates, and in a few days effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a peace with the Regency. He ranſomed all the Dutch captives, which the Algerines, had in their poſſeſſion. It being an old cuſtom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:033747_0129_0FF9186968FEE750"/>
the Algerines, when they make a peace with any Chriſtian nation, to oblige that nation to ranſom the Dey's chief ſervant, and the ſweeper of his palace, ſhould they be of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent nation, from the captives liberated.—Accordingly, when the Dutch ranſomed their captives, they alſo ranſomed one Philip Sloan, an American, who was captured in the year '75 on board the Ship Dolphin of Philadelphia; commanded by Richard O'Brien, he being at this time the ſweeper of the palace.</p>
                     <p>In the month of September, '94, the Alge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines captured two hundred and one Corſicans. The manner of capturing them was ſomewhat ſingular. The Corſicans, while they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the government of France, had licence from the Dey of Algiers, to fiſh for Coral on the coaſt of Africa, from the bay of Bona, to the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland Gallette. They having now ſurrendered the Iſland of Corſica <note n="*" place="bottom">Corſica lies between the gulf of Genoa, and the Iſland, of Sardinia—<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

They ſailed under the convoy of an armed brig. Having been a few days upon the coaſt, a French cruiſing frigate cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured their convoy, and ſeveral, of their boats. The reſt ſought refuge in the harbor of Bona. The Alcaid, (or Mayor of the town) not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:033747_0130_0FF9186BEA217238"/>
their flag, (which is a white field with a Moors head in the centre,) and thinking this too delicious a morſel to paſs unnoticed, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them all in the Mortimore or dungeon, and ſecured their boats. He then ſent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the Dey of Algiers, what he had done, aſking his orders concerning them. The Dey being always willing to catch at every opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of plundering, and thinking this too valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a gem to eſcape his predatory rapine, he commanded them all to be brought to Algiers, and made ſlaves, which was accordingly done. They remained in captivity until the month of March '96. And were then ranſomed by the Engliſh, at the rate of 1,200, dollars each: And the Engliſh made the following addition to their former Treaty. The Algerines may carry their prizes into Corſica, and ſell them publicly. Every month a packet ſhall carry letters from and to Corſica, to and from Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers. The Engliſh ſhall take nothing which they find on board the Algerine veſſels, and if any difficulties, ſhall ariſe, the Dey ſhall decide upon it. The Dey (for the ſtipulated ſum of 1,200 dollars each) grants liberty to all ſlaves now in his poſſeſſion who were born in the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland of Corſica, and permits the Corſicans to fiſh for Coral upon the coaſts of Barbary.</p>
                     <p>On the 24th of April '95, we had the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of being deprived of the moſt Tyrannic guardian, or taſk-maſter, we ever had during my captivity. He was know by the name of Sherief. This cruel villain never appeared to be
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:033747_0131_0FF91871B3E77DA8"/>
be in his element, except when he was cruelly puniſhing ſome Chriſtian captives. On the day before mentioned; he with another taſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter being ſent with twenty ſlaves, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move a pile of boards, which was in a maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine, upon the walls of the city, and he having beat ſeveral ſlaves, unmercifully without any provocation; an American exclaimed (in the Engliſh language, which the Turk did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,) "God grant you may die, the firſt time you offer to abuſe another man." A few minutes afterwards, as a ſlave was going upon ſome plank, which was laid from the firſt wall to the ſecond, having his load upon his back. Sherief thinking he did not proceed as faſt as he might, ran and endeavoring to ſtrike him, miſſed his ſtroke; his ſtick gave him ſuch a ſudden jirk, that he fell from the planks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the walls, and was daſhed to pieces.—Thus ended the days of a godleſs wretch, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently in a moment, ſwept away by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout breath of a ſuffering Chriſtian; to the great joy and ſatiſfaction of all the ſlaves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the regency.</p>
                     <p>On the 28th of Auguſt, an Engliſh privateer Xebec, belonging to Gibralter was cruiſing on the coaſt, off Oran, and being in want of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions ſent her boat on ſhore, to purchaſe ſome; As ſoon as the boat landed, the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians demanded of the officer, his paſſport for the veſſel, and being told it was on board, they ſent off a boat, and very politely invited the Captain, to enter the port, with his veſſel, and
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:033747_0132_0FF9187A247B9980"/>
purchaſe, what he ſtood in need of. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly went in and brought his veſſel to an anchor. No ſooner was this done than they demanded of him, his paſſport, which was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately produced. On examining it, they found it was for a ſquare rigged veſſel, and his privateer being a Xebec, it excited ſuſpicion. They therefore, confined the captain and crew, and ſent them in irons to Algiers. The Dey on ſeeing the paſſport, declared the veſſel and crew to be Genoeſe, with falſe papers, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly condemned them as ſuch. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained eight months, in captivity, and were then liberated by the Britiſh government.</p>
                     <p>We heard many encouraging reports, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our captivity, but none proved to be fact, until the month of July 1795, when a veſſel arrived from Gibralter, and brought us the joyful news, that David Humphreys, <abbr>Eſq.</abbr> and Joſeph Donaldſon, Jun. <abbr>Eſq.</abbr> had arrived at that place, from America, a few days previous to her ſailing, and that Mr. Donaldſon was deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for Algiers, to effect a peace between the Regency, and the United States of America.—This news was confirmed about the tenth of Auguſt, when a Spaniſh courier arrived from Alicant, with a letter from Mr. Donaldſon, (who was then at that place) directed to the Dey of Algiers, the contents of which was to obtain the Dey's permiſſion for him to come and conclude a peace between the two nations. The Dey at this time being very anxious, to have an American Ambaſſador come, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociate
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:033747_0133_0FF9187E1D1B4B40"/>
with him for a peace, and the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the captives, and wiſhing to have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs amicably ſettled between him and the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited States, he chartered a Raguſean polacre, and ſent her to Alicant, to bring Mr. Donald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to Algiers. She ſailed on the eleventh of Auguſt, and when ſhe had been fourteen or ſixteen days abſent, and not hearing any thing from her, our ſpirits were very much damped, fearing ſome miſhap had befallen her; as eight or ten days is ſufficient to perform this voyage with a common chance of winds. We how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, feared the worſt and hoped for the beſt, until the joyful day at laſt arrived. Thurſday, the 3d of September, 1795, the wind being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout W. b. S. at nine A. M. ſaw a ſail from the marine bearing N. b. W. ſtanding directly for the harbour. At eleven, A. M. we could diſcern that ſhe had a white flag at her fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>top-gallant-maſt head, the American flag at the main, and the Raguſean flag over her ſtern.—This being a flag of truce, and denoting the American ambaſſador was on board. Such tranſports is were raiſed in our hearts at this moment (with the anticipation of approaching Liberty) are conceivable, but far tranſcends the power of deſcription. At 3 P. M. ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within one mile of the mole, the harbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter went on board with permiſſion from the Dey, for Mr. Donaldſon to land when he tho't proper. At 4 he landed, and was conducted by ſome of the chief men of the place, to a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:033747_0134_0FF9188579F95EA0"/>
elegant houſe, which the Dey had provided for him, previous to his arrival.</p>
                     <p>It now being too late for him to ſee the Dey that night, he was obliged to refer the negociation till Saturday. Friday the 4th be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Mahometan Sabbath, he could not do any kind of buſineſs with the Dey. The ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, the hope, fear, and agitation we ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this day, may be conceived, but not deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. An ambaſſador to redeem us had arrived. What would be his ſucceſs we knew not—a whole day was paſſing away and nothing done. Never was there a longer, more tedious day in the annals of ſlavery—Again we muſt repair to our manſion of miſery, and in ſuſpence wear out a night of ſleepleſs anxiety.</p>
                     <p>Saturday, the 5th about 11 A. M. Mr. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldſon was invited into the Dey's preſence.—Accordingly he went and about twelve o'clock a peace was concluded. The American flag was then hoiſted on board the Raguſean pola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre, and the banner of the United States was ſaluted from the caſtles of Fenelle and Corda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lares, with the thunders of twenty one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non. Sounds more raviſhing never vibrated in the air; our hearts hearts were joy. We imagined ourſelves already free men. In idea, our chains were falling off, &amp; our taſk-maſters no longer at liberty to torture us. In imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation we were already traverſing the ocean; hailing our native ſhore; embracing our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, our children and our wives. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirium of joy was of ſhort duration; like a
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:033747_0135_0FF9188D83215888"/>
dazzling meteor in a dark night, which blazes for a moment, making ſucceeding darkneſs more dreadful; our enchanting hopes left us to deſpondency, horrible beyond deſcription. In about five hours we were informed that the cup of our ſufferings was not yet drained;—that we could not be releaſed till our ranſom was paid! Never was there a more ſudden or affecting change in the countenances and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations of men. Inſtead of ſprightly looks, cheerful congratulations and ſanguine anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of finiſhed bliſs; there was nothing but faces of ſadneſs and the moſt gloomy ſilence, interrupted only with ſounds of complaint, or ſighs of diſpair. "Not releaſed till our ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom is paid!" How long, ſaid we, may our country neglect us? How many fatalities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall our redemption on its paſſage! How many diſappointments may yet occur! How long may our chains and torments be continued!</p>
                     <p>After we had done work that evening and retired to our gloomy Bagnio; I was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, by the Dey's Chriſtian Clerk, that my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, Abiel Willis, and Thomas Billings, muſt immediately repair to the ambaſſador's houſe! he accordingly procured permiſſion from the keeper of the priſon, to let us paſs out. On our arrival at Mr. Donaldſon's houſe, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed us that the Dey had granted him three captives, as ſervants to him, and that he was under an obligation to pay a certain ſum to the Regency for our labour, that he was likewiſe reſponſible for our good behaviour, and hoped
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:033747_0136_0FF918927B8AF738"/>
we ſhould behave ourſelves accordingly. We remained with him and Mr. Barlow, in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of ſervants., from this day, until the day of our liberation. This was a great favour, conferred on us, for now we were exempted from the labour and torture of theſe execrable taſk maſters, but ſtill we were ſlaves. Diſguiſe thyſelf as thou wilt, ſtill, ſlavery, thou art a bitter draught.</p>
                     <p>On Friday the 11th, Captain O'Brien, was liberated by Mr. Donaldſon, and diſpatched by him from Algiers, on board a Spaniſh veſſel, with diſpatches for Mr. Humphreys, who was at this time in Liſbon. We had information, about five weeks afterwards, that Capt O'Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en arrived at Malaga, after a paſſage of ſeven days, and that he took paſſage from thence for Liſbon, by land. This again revived our hopes, and every veſſel that appeared in ſight, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured, was bringing the money for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. But what perturbations we ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, during this period, is far beyond my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of deſcription. Month after month, was paſſing away, and veſſel after veſſel arriving, but no tidings of our manumiſſion. In this moſt gloomy ſituation we worried out four long months, an had almoſt deſpaired of ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er being releaſed, and were beginning to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that all we had heard or ſeen, was a phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, intended only to illure our hopes, and then leave us in immenſe embarraſſments, as an <hi>Ignis ſatuus</hi> doth the heedleſs traveller. About
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:033747_0137_0FF91898DB2A7F90"/>
the middle of January 1796, Mr. Donaldſon informed us, that he had received letters from Mr. Humphreys, and expected the money for our redemption would be in Algiers, within ten or twelve days. This in ſome meaſure al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leviated our drooping ſpirits; however, we were ſtill fearful, leaſt the Dey ſhould take um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage at ſuch long delays, and order Mr. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldſon away, break the truce, &amp; recommence hoſtilities. Should this happen we knew our awful deſtiny, which would be to ſpend our days in ſlavery.</p>
                     <p>In this ſuſpence we continued until the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of March, and no money arrived, when (O! horrible tidings) we underſtood that the Dey had got impatient with the delay of the money, and had ordered Mr. Donaldſon to leave the place, and declared he would ſend out his corſairs and bring in every American veſſel they met with, and that he would never make a peace with the United States, during his reign. Now again we were deſpondent, and not without a reaſon. Conſider reader, what muſt have been our feelings at this time. For me to attempt, to deſcribe them, would be endeavouring to effect an impoſſibility. I therefore leave the reader to judge from his own breaſt, what terrible convulſions muſt have been raiſed in ours, at this dilemma; after ſo many enchanting hopes, had appeared, that we ſhould be left to this deſpondency.</p>
                     <p>On the 21ſt of March, a brig arrived in the bay, with the American colours over her ſtern,
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:033747_0138_0FF8C59B6A4A6698"/>
and ſhe proved to be the Sally of Philadelphia, commanded by—March, from Marſeilles. She brought as a paſſenger Joel Barlow, <abbr>Eſq.</abbr> Conſul General of the United States of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, for the city and kingdom of Algiers. The Dey gave him liberty to land, as a private gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, but not to perform the functions of his office. This worthy gentleman, whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate ſervices for his diſtreſſed country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, can never be eſtimated too highly, nor praiſed too much, gave us all the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he could; aſſuring us, he would never quit Algiers, and leave us in ſlavery. While we were in this ſuſpence, we received the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing letter from Col. David Humphreys, <abbr>Eſq.</abbr> who likewiſe faithfully did for us all that could be done.</p>

                     <p>A few days afterwards, Mr. Barlow, (thro' the interceſſion of the Sweediſh Conſul, and ſome of the principal officers of the Regency, who had great influence with the Dey.) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained permiſſion to ſee this deſpotic Algerine prince; with whom he made new arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and obtained a further indulgence of three months to procure the money in. Our hopes were again revived with theſe new ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociations, and we meditated a poſſibility of
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:033747_0140_0FF918A7988B0908"/>
his obtaining it, before the time ſpecified ſhould expire.</p>
                     <p>About the firſt of April, Mr. Donaldſon ſailed from Algiers deſtined for Leghorn, on board a Venetian ſhip, and we were informed that his miſſion, was to procure the money for our redemption. At the time of his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Plague that fatal epidemical diſorder, had ſpread its alarm in the country adjacent. And which ſoon made its appearance (for the ſecond time, during my captivity) in the city, and which put a period to the exiſtence of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of my fellow-countrymen, <note n="*" place="bottom">See the liſt of Veſſels and Crews captured by the Algorines.</note> when they were expecting every day to be called free men.</p>
                     <p>The long and tedious days paſſed, as they had done before, with the expectation of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, in every coming ſail. But (O! hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to relate) at length the time ſpecified was expired and no money had arrived, and we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected every moment to hear the awful ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, of Slavery for life, paſſed upon us.—What elſe could we expect or even hope from a ferocious abſolute Monarch, like Haſſan Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw, <note n="‡" place="bottom">The Dey of Algines.</note> one of the genuine children of Iſhmael, whoſe "hands was againſt every man, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man's hand againſt him." But inſtead of the terrible ſentence of continued ſlavery, the next ſound which echoed in our ears, was the joyful news, <hi>of approaching Liberty.</hi> For
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:033747_0141_0FF918AAC548B110"/>
                        <hi>(the ever be praiſed)</hi> Mr. Barlow, on ſeeing the time, wherein the money was to be produced, was already paſſed, and neither tidings, nor money appeared, and being fearful leaſt the Dey, ſhould be again exaſperated with its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, he uſed his utmoſt efforts to procure it in Algiers. He accordingly abtained a promiſe from <hi>Mr. Machio Baccri,</hi> (who was a Jew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Regency) that he would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance him, one hundred and eighty thouſand dollars, in the courſe of three of four days, which was juſt the ſum required for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the American captives. The Dey (on being informed of this by Mr. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low) at firſt refuſed to let us go, becauſe the money to pay for the peace had not arrived, however he at laſt conſented to take it, and ſet us at liberty. On the 5th of July, we were informed by a letter from Mr. Barlow that we might expect to be at liberty within three or four days. But adviſed us not to put too much dependence, for ſays he, "the heart of your Pharoah may be again hardened." He however aſſured us that he had no doubt but we ſhould be free men within three days: for as the Dey had agreed to accept the money, it ſhould be paid as ſoon as it could be counted. This filled our hearts with joy, and we imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ourſelves the happieſt people in the world. For a long period we had been ſuffering the moſt inhuman ſlavery; loaded with almoſt an inſupportable weight of chains, and were now expecting to enjoy Liberty; the greateſt bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

human beings ever poſſeſſed. And our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations at this time were not viſionary nor unfounded, as had ſo often been the caſe with us before, for it proved to be a happy reality. What a joyful night was this. We paſſed it with praiſes to our kind deliverer. And ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine anticipations of enſuing freedom. Our ſtoney floors on which we laid, were apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſofter than beds of down. The chains on our legs were ſeemingly of on weight. Our cruel taſk-maſters now looked on us, with ſmiling countenances, and congratulated us, on our good fortune, in the following ſingular manner: <hi>"Sanzafidas droak imche il blaedic, ila kelp ou Romi."</hi> Which in Engliſh is thus, "you unbelievers, now your are going to the country of Chriſtian dogs."</p>
                     <p>On the 10th at day break in the morning, all hands were called as uſual. And a few minutes before the time, that the doors are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened for the ſlaves to go out to work; we were notified by the Bagnio-keeper, that all the people taken under the American flag muſt ſtay in the Bagnio, and hold themſelves in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to go to the Dey's palace, and receive our <hi>tiſcaras,</hi> or paſſ-ports from the Dey; and that we ſhould be embarked the next morning. However it ſo happened, that the Dey could not attend, to give us our <hi>tiscaras</hi> that night, though he received the money. This long and tedious night was ſpent, in anxious expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of hearing the ſweet ſound of Liberty echo in our ears, on the approaching morning.
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:033747_0143_0FF918B4CE5ED928"/>
And O! glorious event, this was the ultimate night we ever ſpent, in that gloomy dungeon, that horrible manſion of wretchedneſs and miſery.</p>
                     <p>On the 11th we were again notified by the Bagnio Keeper, that we muſt be ready to go to the Dey's palace, for our paſſ-port. A ſhort time after the ſlaves of other nations had gone out to work we were all called out of the Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio, into the ſtreet, where we were received by the Dey's chief clerk, who conducted us to the palace, and there each man received his <hi>tiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cara</hi> from the Dey. The ſweeper of the palace at this time, being a Venetian, he was liberated according to cuſtom. At 9 o'clock, A. M. we all embarked on board a ſhip, belonging to Mr. Machio Baccri. This veſſel had formerly been an Engliſh tranſport (the Bridget of London) had been captured by the French Republicans, and brought into Algiers, and there condemned. On board of this ſhip were alſo forty eight Neapolitans, who had been ranſomed a few days before us. Oh! what a glorious ſight, now could we behold the ſtripes and ſtars fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with honor, where they had ſo often been hoiſted with contempt. Every tongue was ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, <hi>long live the humane benevolent Barlow.—O! Happy day, O! Happy day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>While we (Americans) were enjoying the fruits of this happy event, there was nothing to be heard, from the ſlaves of other nations, but the moſt bitter curſes heaped upon their governments, and Sovereigns. They being

chiefly of the Roman Catholic Religion, are taught, that they are the only true Chriſtians, and having now ſeen the Dutch, and Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans liberated, and they neglected, it exaſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to ſuch a degree, that they would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim in the moſt violent language againſt their Prieſts, Sovereigns, and religion. "Why," ſaid they, "are we, who are true Chriſtians, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noticed, by our country and ſuffered to remain here in ſlavery, while the Proteſtants, (who are no more than degenerated chriſtians) are daily emancipated, and are not ſuffered to wear the yoke of ſlavery." They would ſay to each other, "Behold what examples of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, are now ſet by the Proteſtants, and how little they are noticed by the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic governments." Theſe and ſimilar ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, were in the mouths of every ſlave, whom we left behind.</p>

Bona is ſuppoſed to be the ſame place with the ancient Hippo, a ſea port, built by the ancients. It was formerly the metropolis of the province of Bona. It lies on a bay of the Mediterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſea, in lat. 36, 45 N. and 7, 53 eaſt long. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two hundred and eighty miles to the eaſtward of the city of Algiers, and about fifty ſeven miles S. W. from the Iſland Gallette.—Near Bona, is La Callee, which is at preſent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuped by the French, who pay an annual tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the Dey of Algiers for the privilege of the coral fiſhery. In this place is a French factory, where the Moors and Arabs diſpoſe of their produce. Bona is about two miles in circumference; it was formerly a magnificent city, but at preſent is a town of very little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and of ſlender population. It is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended by a fortreſs, and a garriſon of Turks, and what is ſufficient to aſcertain the depth of its wretchedneſs, (as well as in all other parts of the territory) is, that a Turk is the moſt reſpectable character among them. In this part of the world, elegant architecture, has for many years, been utterly forgotten or deſpiſed. The buildings are therefore very mean, and are expoſed to the incurſions of the Arabs—The name of theſe people is uſed in a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determinate manner. Although Algiers is at a very long diſtance from Arabia, yet as this part of Africa was formerly ſubdued by the Arabians, under the banner of Mahomet, the name is ſtill applied to a race of dark complec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, independent Barbarians, who ſpread
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:033747_0148_0FF918D04720F380"/>
about the country in devious routs, unite the double profeſſion of a ſhepherd and a robber. Bona is computed to contain about nine thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand inhabitants, who are compoſed of the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity of many different nations. It has their moſques, which are ſomewhat larger than the other buildings, though theſe are by no means magnificent. It is commanded by an <hi>Alcaid</hi> who pays an annual tribute to the Dey of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers, in wheat, butter, honey, and oil. The former grandeur of this city, is now only to be traced in the remains, and ruins of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient monaſtery. Near the river Sef Gomar, &amp; not far from Conſtantina <note n="*" place="bottom">The capital of a province of the ſame name in Algiers.</note> is an ancient and noble bridge; which is built acroſs a valley. This bridge has five arches, and extends from one mountain to another. There is not the leaſt appearance of any river ever having been under it, and it is ſuppoſed it was built mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to gratify the curioſity of ſome ancient prince, or king who commanded in thoſe parts in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer days, but no hiſtory gives any account of its founder. Near this is a very large ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous aqueduct, which terminates in a caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade. It is reported that ſtate criminals are ſometimes precipitated down this place, and are daſhed to pieces upon the rocks at the bottom.</p>
                     <p>On the 21ſt of December we began to take on board our cargo, and finiſhed loading on the 15th of January '97, and ſailed for Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiles on the 17th.</p>

Captain Smith, was then ordered to go on board the Inconſtant, with his papers, which he accordingly did, &amp; after a ſtrict exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination they manned our ſhip, from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant, and took Captain Smith, the ſecond mate, and all our ſeamen, on board the frigate, and kept them upon priſoners allowance. Being left on board the Fortune, I did not want for proviſions, and was treated very politely by the prize-maſter and crew. We were then order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for adjudication, to Porto Ferrajo, in the tin the Iſland of Elba. On the 15th in the morning we ſaw the Iſlands of Corſica, Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gona and Elba and having a freſh breeze from the weſtward, we anchored in Porto Ferrajo, at 5, P. M.</p>

The reſt of us being determined not to enter in the Britiſh ſervice, we procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a paſſage for Leghorn. Having been rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of the greateſt part of our cloaths and all our money by the captors, we found it very difficult to ſubſiſt untill the veſſel was ready to ſail, as one meal of victuals could not be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed here for leſs than eighty cents.</p>

                     <p>When the French took poſſeſſion of Leghorn, which is the capital ſea-port of Tuſcany, and obliged the Engliſh to flee, the latter by way of retaliation, took poſſeſſion of Porto Ferrajo, into which place they carried, and condemned their prizes at this time, but returned it to the Grand Duke about the beginning of May, '97.

We ſailed for Leghorn on the 23d, and arrived on the 24th, and were kept in quarantine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the 5th of March, on which day Captain Smith arrived from Porto Ferrajo. The reaſon of our being put into quarantine at this time was on account of our having come from Barbary, as there is a law among all Chriſtian nations, who border on the Mediterranean;—that when any veſſel arrives in their ports, the commander of ſuch veſſel muſt ſhew his bill of health, and affirm that his veſſel has not been boarded by any veſſel of war or any veſſel whatever, having come from Barbary, before he can get permiſſion to go on ſhore. If his veſſel has been boarded by any of the above mentioned veſſels, or his laſt port was one of thoſe of Barbary, he and his veſſel are obliged to ride a quarantine. And as the laſt port we ſailed from, in the Fortune, was Bona, before we were taken by the Engliſh, we were liable to this quarantine, but the Engliſh command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, on his arrival at Porto Ferrajo, went im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately on ſhore without having obtained permiſſion, in conſequence of which the whole Iſland was put into quarantine, and any boat, veſſel, or perſon, going from this Iſland while it was under this reſtriction, were obliged to perform their quarantine in the port where they arrived.</p>
                     <p>On the 10th, Captain Smith ſailed from Marſeilles, on board a polacre belonging to Genoa, taking with him all the remainder of the Fortune's crew, except myſelf and Moſes

Brown: Brown, at this time being ſick in the hoſpital, was not able to proceed; but ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter recovered his health and went to Marſeilles by land; from whence he took paſſage for Philadelphia, on board a brig belonging to that place. On the 15th Mr. Donaldſon, (who was the American Ambaſſador at this time in the Mediterranean) informed me that he was going to Porto Ferrajo, and wiſhed to have me accompany him, as his chief buſineſs was, to endeavour to recover the ſhip Fortune. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly waited till he was ready to go. On the 19th Mr. Donaldſon told me he ſhould be ready to go the next morning, and deſired that I would take a boat, and five men, (which he had procured) and proceed to Piombino a ſmall port in the dominions of the King of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and there wait his arrival, as he intended to go to that place by land, in order to ſettle ſome buſineſs, at Pisa, <note n="*" place="bottom">

Piombino the ſame afternoon. Mr. Donald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon arrived on the 22d, and we ſailed for Porto Ferrajo, early the next morning, where we arrived the ſame evening, the diſtance being but twelve leagues. On the 24th, we ſailed again for Leghorn; the next day, the wind being contrary, and blowing a very freſh breeze we deemed it not ſafe to continue at ſea in an open boat, and therefore run into St. Vincen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi, a ſmall town in Tuſcany. On the 26th, the wind being in our favour, we ſailed at 4 A. M. and arrived at Leghorn at 6 o'clock, in the afternoon. My whole time was now em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, in ſeeking for a paſſage to my native country, and having nothing to depend on for my ſubſiſtence, but the few cloaths, which the Engliſh had been pleaſed to let me keep, as they did not think them worth taking from me; the greateſt part of which I was obliged to ſell to purchaſe me ſomething to eat. My caſe was now become truly diſtreſſing, and how long it would remain ſo, I knew not, for as the French had poſſeſſion of the place, all bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs was entirely ſtagnated, except privateer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and where to go, to better myſelf I was at a loſs, as I was informed every day by the pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets which arrived, that no American veſſels, were in any of the ports of Italy.</p>
                     <p>While waiting for a paſſage I will endeavor to give the Reader a ſhort deſcription of Leg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn. This city is the ancient Portus Libur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, belonging to the Grand Duke of Tuſcany is not remarkably large, but is regularly built,
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:033747_0155_0FF91A4068A6E028"/>
and is in the modern taſte. It is well fortified. It contains about 40,000 inhabitants 20,000 of whom are Jews. The moſt of the trade paſſes through their hands. It is a free port, which makes the trade here very conſiderable, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently a great reſort for Merchants of all nations. It has a ſecure harbor but is apt to be choaked up, ſo that the Grand Duke's ſlaves are employed in clearing it. The Marſhes about the place are filled with the ſand which they take out of the harbor, by which means the city is render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more healthful than uſual. Foreigners pay only a piaſtres, or ſcuds, for a bale of goods of what bulk or quality ſoever it be, yet the quantity of Merchandize imported is ſo large, that this ſmall duty is no ſmall revenue to the Duke. But the inland duties are very high, nothing paſſing in or out of Leghorn by land, but the inhabitants pay large taxes. For the convenience of navigation, there is a light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe lanthorn, with 30 lamps, erected on a rock without the harbor. And on the ſhore a lazaretto, where ſuſpected perſons, or goods, muſt perform quarantine. Here all nations, and even the Mahometans, have free acceſs, and may ſettle. The Jews live in a particular part of the city, have a handſome ſynagogue, and though ſubject to very heavy impoſts, are in a thriving condition.</p>
                     <p>I remained in this ſituation until the 1ſt of April, when I had information of a Daniſh brig, (then laying in the harbour) being bound to America, I immediately went on board, and
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:033747_0156_0FF91A454CE94C40"/>
aſked the Captain where he was bound, he told me to Boſton, I aſked him if he would give me a paſſage for my work, he ſaid he had men enough, and could not give any one a paſſage; but if I would pay him an hundred dollars he would carry me, to this propoſal I readily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, as I was not the owner of that number of pence; at laſt he told me if I would do a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's duty, on the paſſage, and give him an obligation to pay him forty dollars on our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, he would take me on board. I told him I would give him an anſwer at twelve o'clock. I then went on ſhore, and as I was walking up the mole, I met a gentleman who aſked me what countryman I was? I told him I was an American. He then aſked me ſeveral queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and enquired if I belonged to any veſſel in the harbour, and after having received my anſwers, he told me he had chartered a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſean polacre, and intended to ſend her to Philadelphia, and that if I would go in her, I ſhould have a paſſage, which I readily accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and returned him my ſincere thanks;—he then told me I might embark the next day, which I accordingly did.</p>
                     <p>At twelve o'clock, I went according to my promiſe, on board the Dane, and informed him that I had got a paſſage to America on board the polacre, at which he appeared to be much diſſatisfied, and offered me a paſſage for my work, but I told him I had engaged to go in the other veſſel, and intended to fulfill my
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:033747_0157_0FF8C5A627B519A0"/>
promiſe, we then parted, and I left him much diſpleaſed, at my not accepting his laſt offer. At the ſame time that he told me he had men enough, he wanted one man to make up his ſhip's company, and was obliged to hire one next day; but knowing my ſituation, and thinking I ſhould be glad to work and pay both, for my paſſage, he endeavoured to take this advantage.</p>
                     <p>On the 2d of April I embarked in the quality of a paſſenger, on board the <hi>Madona del roſario eſan vineenzo feraro</hi> of Raguſa, which was the polacre before mentioned, bound to Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia. We ſailed on the 4th, and on the 11th, was taken by a Spaniſh privateer and carried into Barcelona, was cleared on the 12th and ſailed again, and on the 20th was captured by a French privateer, and carried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Almeria, treated politely and cleared on the 22d, and ſailed. On the 29th, the wind hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been contrary for ſeveral days, we run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Malaga, where we waited for a fair wind until the 21ſt of May. We then ſailed, and on the 22d was boarded by his Britannic Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's ſhip Petterel, treated very well and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to proceed on our voyage.</p>
                     <p>On the 23d, at 6, A. M. was boarded by two Spaniſh privateers, (Gibraltar then bearing W. N. W. about three leagues diſtant) and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Ceuta, a ſmall port on the coaſt of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary, at preſent occupied by the Spaniards, and having ſtruck one of the privateerſmen with a ſword, and wounded him on the arm, was
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:033747_0158_0FF91A49BA7FA5A0"/>
put into a dungeon, ironed hands and feet, where I was kept about an hour and an half, and then let out. The veſſel was cleared the ſame evening, and we ſailed for Philadelphia.</p>
                     <p>On the 28th, being in lat. 31. 54. N. and long. 17. 25. W. was boarded by a Spaniſh privateer, of 14 guns, and robbed of a quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of proviſions, and the greateſt part of our cloathes, and then permitted to proceed. On the 1ſt of July was boarded by his Britanic Majeſty's ſhip Woolwich, mounting fifty guns. This ſhip had taken twenty five ſail of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can veſſels under her convoy, from the Iſlands of Grenada, and Antigua, and had left them the day before ſhe fell in with us. After hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing examined our papers, they permitted us to proceed on our voyage. Being very ſhort of proviſions, we endeavoured to get ſome from on board the Woolwich, but could not be ſupplied, ſhe being as ſhort as ourſelves.—On the 24th, latt. 38. 20. N. and long. 74. 10. W. ſpoke the brig Jefferſon, from St. Croix bound to Philadelphia, from whom we got a ſupply of proviſions, having been about forty days upon leſs than one biſcuit per day, with nothing elſe except oil, and wine.</p>

Brown, whom I left at Leghorn. I remained here (being indiſpoſed) until the 11th of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt. I then ſailed in the quality of a paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger on board the ſchooner Jay, belonging to Edgartown (on the Iſland of Martha's Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard) commanded by David Smith, bound to Boſton, where we arrived on the 17th. On the 23d I took paſſage for Newburyport, and arrived the ſame evening, where I had the inexpreſſible happineſs of being reſtored to my friends, and native place, after an abſence of four years and one month, and after having endured the ſevereſt of hardſhips. Thus out of nine perſons who left Baltimore on board the Brig Polly, ſour only returned, as follows: Michael Smith, Benjamin Edwards, Moſes Brown, and myſelf, the reſt all died with the plague.</p>
