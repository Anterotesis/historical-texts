            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Scriptural Cautions, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>AT the earneſt requeſt of many ſerious minded perſons, I have undertaken to preſent to public view the neceſſity of their receiving and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evidences of a ſaving intereſt in Chriſt, by faith and love; accompanied with practical Godlineſs,</p>
            <p>And, From a diſcovery of the deplorable ſtate of the inhabitants of our land, appearing awfully ſunk down and involved in ſin and diſobedience againſt God, and the ſtrong deluſions pointed out in the ſcriptures, ſpreading amongſt the people; and from ſorrowful experience of the baneful effects of my own family's being infatuated with this new, falſe and ſtrange religion; which is attended with all deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs.</p>
            <p>In deep humiliation I would advertiſe all people, that are deſirous of the knowledge of the truth, that they may be ſaved from theſe impending deluſions; with ſcriptural cautions, againſt giving their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to falſe Chriſts and falſe Prophets; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore attend to the words of wiſdom, from the wiſe King of Iſrael, againſt giving attention to, or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing after the ſtrange WOMAN, or her Proſolites: Who flatter with their lips, Proverbs vii. 5, and at times is loud and ſtubborn; her feet abideth not in her houſe; therefore let not your hearts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to her ways: Go not aſtray in her paths for ſhe hath caſt down many, wounded, yea her houſe is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death, Proverbs vii. 11, 25, 26, 27. She having ſeparated from, and left her own huſband, as I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, contrary to divine authority, Matt. xix. 5, 6. I. Cor. vii. 2, 3, 4, 5. She and her adherents teach others to do the ſame, through which means inſtead
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:018310_0003_0FA5C8D81A8DF558"/>of being a crown, to their huſbands, they become as rottenneſs in his bones; Proverbs xii. 4. She ſelleth families through her witchcrafts. Mal. iii. 4. for they become tributary to her, as well as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in Satan's ſnare.—It may be obſerved that this ſcheme is carried on and ſupported with all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivableneſs. II. Theſſ. ii. 10. She is ſubtil of heart and their ways are movable, they may at firſt appear with many good words and fair ſpeeches to deceive the hearts of the ſimple, repeating thoſe miracles they have power to do. Rev. xii. 14. And there was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean ſpirits to come out of the mouth of the falſe prophet working miracles. Rev. xvi. 13, 14. They often change from this ſcheme of flattery and appear in a very great fury calling it the anger of God, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin, telling perſons they are going right to hell, except they come into relation with that body of Europeans they ſtile the CHURCH, and ſubjected in perfect obedience to them;—hence they wear the rough garment to deceive, as in Zach. xii. 4. If it be one that is perſuaded of a ſaving intereſt in God's ſalvation, through faith in the blood and right teouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt; they will very artfully labour to draw a vail between him and all his former views of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by the virtue of Chriſt's blood; and tell them it will all avail them nothing, but he is the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loſt from God for what he has heretofore experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced of light, comfort and conſolation; therefore there is no way to eſcape hell, but to lay open all the ſecret ſins of his paſt life to them for they ſay God cannot be found any where elſe but in that body they belong to; therefore it appears that it is a ſtrange God they worſhip, as well as a ſtrange Woman they follow; I am perſuaded it is not the God of the whole univerſe for he fills heaven and earth, therefore in him we live move and have our being; ſince there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they give their adorations to ſuch a ſtrange Deity, and adore a poor old Woman as the head and ſource of their influences; we may obſerve they have ſtrange laws, which run counter to the laws and
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:018310_0004_0FA5C8D9E502A3D0"/>commands of the true God of Iſrael; they urge that for men and their own wives to dwell together according to knowledge in the uſe of means for multiplication according to God's appointment, is a damning ſin; therefore the man and his wife muſt part aſunder in that reſpect and not ſo much as lodge in one bed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;—but the God that made them at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning made them male and female, and tempered them together; commanding them to be fruitful and multiply, annexing his bleſſing to them, Gen. i. 28. God ſaw fit to make the woman, a help meat for the man, being bone of his bone and fleſh of his fleſh, Gen. ii. 23. Again, we may obſerve God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed his covenant with Noah; after he came out of the ark, when the old world was drowned, and commanded them to be fruitful and multiply, and bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein, Gen. ix. 7, 8 Moreover the ſuperſtitious Phariſees came to our Saviour tempting him with this queſtion; whether or no it was lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cauſe; obſerve the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of that divine perſon by whom we were at firſt formed and who ſpake us into being; he anſwered the ſuperſtitious Phariſees &amp; ſaid unto them; have ye not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female, and ſaid for this cauſe, ſhall a man leave father and mother and ſhall cleave to his wife, and they twain ſhall be one fleſh; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are no more twain but one fleſh; what therefore God has joined together let no man put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder;—and tells them, ſome for the hardneſs of their hearts were ſuffered to put away their wives, but it was not ſo from the beginning, and he plainly tells them the conſequences of ſuch procedings is to become adulterers, Matt. ix. 3,—10, therefore Paul willeth that the young women marry, bear children, guide their houſe, and give no occaſion to their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary to ſpeak reproachfully; hence it is that mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is honorable in all, and the bed undefiled; but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:018310_0005_0FA5C8DA4A95E278"/>I. Tim. v. 14. Heb. xiii. 4. Therefore it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from divine authority that the laws and rules coming forth from the ſtrange Woman and her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolites, does not correſpond with, but runs counter to the laws and inſtitutions of the God of the true Iſrael, under both law and goſpel: To blind peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples eyes they urge they muſt not indulge any of the works of the fleſh; now the apostle tells us the works of the fleſh are manifeſt, which are theſe adultry, fornication, idolatry, witchcraft, &amp;c. with many other wicked practices. But in the catalogue of the works of the fleſh he does not once call in queſtion; men's and women's labouring with their hands in a lawful way, for the things needful to their bodies nor partaking of thoſe things for their nouriſhment and comfort, if it be received with thankſgiving to the author of their benefits. Neither does the inſpired apoſtle once mention men and their own wives dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling together according to knowledge, or lodging in one bed together, to be the works of the fleſh; but the apoſtle deſcribes the works of the fleſh, Gal. v. 19, 20. Furthermore in this ſtrange religion is found the generations that Solomon ſpeaks of in Prov. xxx. 11. 12, that curſes their father and does not bleſs their mother, and are pure in their own eyes, and never have been waſhed from their filthineſs; if any ſhould deny this aſſertion, it is too obvious from their own conduct to be denied, which may be prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by good authority; what heavier curſes can a child denounce againſt his parents than to call them devils and tell them they will wake in hell? yet theſe poor deluded creatures boaſt of their holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as though none could convince them of ſin; it further appears they are not waſhed from their filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, from their own teſtimony, diſowning any being born again but thoſe Europeans, which they call the church; yet they will impoſe upon the public, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to teach them the way to heaven, and the things of the kingdom. And yet our Saviour teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Nicodemus, except a man be born again he
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:018310_0006_0FA5C8DAEB2BD588"/>cannot ſee the kingdom of God; conſequently they are ſtrangers to the things of that kingdom, for if they are not born of God, they are of their father the devil. John, viii. 44. Therefore we may not think it ſtrange if they claſh in the face of God's authority, even to curſing father and mother, and parting aſunder huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and wife; for Chriſt tells them the works of their father they will do, for he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth; they alſo countenance and indulge huſbands leaving their own wives, and children, and depriving them of his intereſt or labour for their maintainance or ſupport, unleſs they will imbrace with them this ſtrange re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion that is attended with ſo many glairing abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Wives diſown all natural affections to their huſbands and children. Thus women become monſters, and men worſe than infidels in this new and ſtrange religion: but when we conſider from whence theſe new laws and rules originate, and who ſtands at the head of their diſcipline, the wonder may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate in ſome degree, for God placed the man next to himſelf in the creation, between the woman and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and enjoined the womans obedience to the man, and ſaid the man ſhould rule over her, Gen. iii. 16. And Paul being inſpired by the ſame ſpirit, ſaith, let the women learn in ſilence with all ſubmiſſion; but ſuffer not a woman to teach, nor to uſurp autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over the man, but to be in ſilence, for Adam was firſt formed, then Eve. I. Tim. ii. 11, 12, 13. But in this new religion, the men hold themſelves in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire ſubjection to the woman, and ſhe has the rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the men to that degree, that it appears to be the common opinion of her adherents and their foremoſt leaders, the oldeſt of which ſtands in more awe and fear of her than children do of their parents.</p>
            <p>Under the lead and influence of this government, ſome being operated upon with ſtrange perſuations, that it is the works of God, acknowledge themſelves filled with blaſphemous thoughts againſt the God of heaven; and at times are under temptations to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:018310_0007_0FA5C8DE7545D910"/>themſelves, and yet are hurried to go forth with the reſt of their company, in their dance as though they were all filled with frolicking devils. Sometimes they will appear with a ſtrange riſing ſhuddering, and trembling, as though the hatchways of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs pit were burſted open, and the infernal ſpirits had broke in among them; therefore they have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kinds of charms to affright, or to allure. From theſe circumſtances it may not be thought ſtrange, if one ſhould conclude their was ſorcery and witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft in the cauſe, ſince they obey not the truth, Gal. iii. 1. They boaſt much of their ſigns and wonders, but I have not found them exalted above what we read of them in the II. Theſſ. ii. 3,—10. And we may ſee it is above all that is called God, and with all powers and ſigns, and lying wonders. Now the ſpirit ſpeaketh expreſly, that in the latter times ſome ſhall depart from the faith, givine heed to ſeducing ſpirits and doctring of devils, ſpeaking lies in hypocriſy, having their conſciences ſeared with a hot iron, forbiding to marry, and commanding to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from meats which God has created to be receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with thankſgiving. I. Tim. iv. 1, 2, 3.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, They urge that a new diſpenſation has taken place, and that Chriſt has come the ſecond time, which they pretend to prove by counting the miſtical numbers ſpecified in the propheſies of Daniel, as well as by their ſigns and wonders. But our Lord Jeſus Chriſt advertiſes us of theſe great ſigns and wonders taking place before his coming; which if it were poſſible would deceive the very elect. Matt. xxiv. 24. Theſe things indicate that the time draws nigh and is even at the doors; but it has pleaſed God in his wiſdom to reſerve the foreſight and knowledge of that time to himſelf, and not reveal it to men nor angels beforehand; but it ſhall come ſudden, to the great ſurpriſe of Chriſt's rejectors and goſpel diſpiſers; for it ſhall come like a thief in the night, on a ſudden as the lightening breaketh forth out of the eaſt and ſhineth unto the weſt, for the Lord ſhall deſcend from
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:018310_0008_0FA5C8DFE9601250"/>heaven with a ſhout, &amp;c. Matt. xxiv. 27, 43, I. Theſſ. iv. 16, &amp;c. Therefore let all perſons that are infatuated with apprehenſions of its being a new diſpenſation, and ſo conclude it may admit of new laws or a new goſpel, be alarmed from the following conſiderations.</p>
            <p>When God had given forth the divine law under the legal diſpenſation, he forbid adding thereto or diminiſhing therefrom. Deut. xii 32. And at the cloſe of the divine records, the Lord tells us, that he that ſhall add to the things of the propheſies of the book, God ſhall add to him all the plagues that are written in the book; and if any man ſhall take away from the words of this prophecy, God ſhall take away his part out of the book of life. Rev. xxii. 18, 19. Therefore ſaith Paul, Though we, or an angel from heaven preach any other goſpel unto you, then that we have preached unto you, let him be accurſed. Gal. i. 8. O then let us all turn our attention from the voice of falſe prophets and the influence of ſeucing ſpirits, and carefully attend to God's word, by which we are to try the ſpirits.—If there ariſe among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee a ſign or a wonder, and the ſign comes to paſs, whereof he ſpake unto thee, ſaying, Let us go after other Gods, which thou haſt not known, and let us ſerve them; thou ſhalt not harken to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams; for the Lord your God proveth you, to know whether you love the Lord your God with your heart and with all your ſoul; ye ſhall walk after the Lord your God, and fear him and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and ye ſhall ſerve him and cleave unto him, and that prophet or that dreamer of dreams ſhall be put to death, becauſe he hath ſpoken to turn you away from the Lord your God. Deut. xiii. 1—5. Now let it excite every one that has named the name of Chriſt, to prayer and watchfulneſs, and that they depart from all iniquity; while we look into this meluncholly
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:018310_0009_0FA5C8E1A697DA30"/>ſcene of ſome departing from the faith, and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were purged from their old ſins, and have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come puſſed up and vain in their imaginations, having their underſtandings darkened, being alien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, becauſe of the blindneſs of their hearts. Eph. iv. 18. And being deſtitute of the principles and powers of ſpiritual life and void of natural affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. What muſt be the conſequence of ſeeking to witches, wizards, charmers and thoſe that have fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar ſpirits, and for children to curſe their parents, huſbands and wives to part aſunder and become adulterers, leaving their poor children deſtitute of any ſupport, and renouncing all natural affections for each other and their offspring, and ſpeaking blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies againſt God, and ſometimes are under ſtrong temptations to murder themſelves, and yet ſeem to be fully perſuaded they are in the work of God.</p>
            <p>And now in order to be deterred from, and guarded againſt thoſe horrid abſurdities, let us all be allarmed from mount Ebal, &amp; conſider the cannons of God's word are loaded with heavy curſes that are pointed againſt ſuch wicked conduct, and will be diſcharged like ſo many blazeing thunder-bolts from the artillery of heaven, in one eternal ſtorm againſt all ſuch miſerable offenders, unleſs timely repentance through the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mercy and long forbearance of God, through the blood and righteouſneſs of Chriſt interpoſe for their relief; for it will not avail for any to plead that thoſe things were but the effects of their ſtrong zeal; it was a very great zeal no doubt in them that cauſed their children to paſs through the fire to Moloch; They built the high places of Baal, to burn their ſons with fire for burnt offerings unto Baal, which the Lord ſays I commanded not, nor ſpake it, neither came it into my mind. Jer. xix. 5.</p>
            <p>From hence we learn the neceſſity of keeping cloſe to the ſacred wor of God as the man of our counſel;
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:018310_0010_0FA5C8E1CD97EF48"/>for it is not only fleſh and blood that we have to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with in the cauſe, but principalities and powers and ſpiritual wickedneſs in high places; wherefore we need to take the whole armour of God, that we may be able to withſtand temptations in this evil day; let us ſtand therefore having on the breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate of righteouſneſs, above all, taking the ſhield of ſaith, wherewith we may quench all the fiery darts of the wicked; and take the helmet of ſalvation and ſword of the ſpirit which is the word of God, praying with all prayer and ſupplication in the ſpirit, and watching thereunto with all perſeverance. Eph. vi. 11—18. Therefore let every ſoul be careful to lay aſide all carnal weapons in this caſe, and uſe none but them that are mighty through God to the pulling down the ſtrong hold of ſin either in ourſelves or others, and caſting down imaginations and every thing that exalteth itſelf againſt God, and let every thought be brought into captivity to the obedience of Chriſt, and let us ever look to the Captain of our ſalvation by faith and prayer, leſt while we are watching the motions of the enemy on one hand, we are caught in his ſnare on the other, and it being but fleeing from the bear for the lion to meet us.</p>
            <p>With ſorrow and grief I muſt confeſs I have been much captivated with, and deeply involved in this new and ſtrange ſcheme, to the admiration of many of my former acquaintances, and was extremely zealous, being perſuaded, it was the only way to perfection out of all ſin; but alas, the great decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is this, to be ever going on in a way that never comes to the knowledge of the truth.</p>
            <p>For the conſideration of inquiring minds, I ſhall mention a few things which were conducive to my falling in with this deceiving ſcheme; the conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of which is to be lamented. Not only ſeeing the encouragible, impenitent, and open profane, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly purſuing every method by which they might
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:018310_0011_0FA5C8E290FD3670"/>expreſs their abſolute contempt both of the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and goodneſs of God, (which ſhould have led them to repentance) as though the flood-gates of ſin and abomination were hoiſted, and each one was ſtriving to be formoſt in the horrid ſtream lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down to the black regions of the burning main.</p>
            <p>And the profeſſing people of our land, who ſtile themſelves Chriſtians, who ought to have kept the feaſt with the unlevened bread of ſincerity, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther been mourning for the abominations of our land in deep humiliation before God.</p>
            <p>But the dark aſpects that appear from their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conduct, ſeem to denote a woful declenſion from goſpel ſimplicity, and true faith is ſcarcely to be found on earth amongſt all its profeſſors, who appear with the mark of infidelity, coveteouſneſs, pride and wantonneſs abounding, at a very enormous height, through which means civil religion appears to be ſtiffled, and almoſt fetched its laſt gaſps in our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing land. The conſideration of theſe things gave me much exerciſe for the want of charity; when there was any ſubjected to the croſs, or had vital union with Chriſt, or walked humbly with God.</p>
            <p>And my mind not being fruitful in the conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, that at ſuch a juncture the man of ſin or ſon of perdition would exalt himſelf and aſcend his reign with the miftry of inquity, ſpreading itſelf with all deceivableneſs.</p>
            <p>I therefore having the oppertunity of an interview with thoſe people, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> me, that a new diſperſation had taken place; and they appearing with their fine-ſpue dreſs of perfection—with the appearance or things ſupernatural, and with many good words, drew my attention to their inchanting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, by which means I ſoon became prejudiced in their favour, and ſubjected to their lead and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:018310_0012_0FA5C8E40DA2B130"/>expecting to find them the people they profeſs to be.</p>
            <p>But alas, I found myſelf awfully deceived, being landed upon a papiſt ſyſtem attended with its own ſpirit, and pregnant with its corrupt principles, vending itſelf with the attempts of tyranny: as the young aſp may act out all the poſtures of the old one, before it has power to bite.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, When I came to hear falſe teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, to my certain knowledge, come forth from thoſe that call themſelves perfect, as well as from their proſolites; under theſe operations and influences de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by them, which has not only been productive to break the moſt tendereſt ties of nature between a man and his wife, but the horrid ſin of adultry is carried on amongſt thoſe ſuperſtitious perifectioners, that pretend, that it is a damning ſin for a man and his own wife to dwell together according to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the natural uſe of each other.</p>
            <p>But ſince their ſcheme is carried on, and with all deceivableneſs, the circumſtances of deception are maniſold.</p>
            <p>Reſpecting their dancing, the general repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they give of it, is, that it is the token of great joy and happineſs of the new Jeruſalem ſtate, and denotes the victory over ſin; a great deception lies in theſe pretentions; for aſk thoſe dancers, whether they are born again, and they will ſay no. Beſides this, the orders from their church, are to labour in their dance to maortify the lufts of the fleſh. Hence they uſe theſe expreſſion in their dance: Labour, labour, mortification before redemption! Thus it evidently appears, that in order to be born again, they muſt ware out their conſtitutions, and reduce their natures ſo low, as not to have any of the common ſeelings of mankind, and by this they are to judge of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing born again; O miſerable Jeruſalem ſtate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:018310_0013_0FA5C8E4C0CB00C0"/>
About two years ago, they held up to view, and was often heard to ſay, if they perſevered in their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, they ſhould never die a natural death; but after they began to die and numbers had died among them, they grew aſhamed of their doctrine of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and began to deny that they ever held to any ſuch thing; thus they are known to ſhiſt and change, to ſay and unſay, to carry and end their ſcheme.</p>
            <p>As to their doctrine, it is well known to all who are acquainted with the ſeveral branches of it, and are alſo acquainted with the doctrine of the church of Rome, that there is no eſſential difference; their doctrine of perſection, celibacy or abſtainance, the doctrine of purgatory or priſon ſtate, the doctrine of church oracles, the doctrine of church power to open and ſhut heaven to acquit and damn ſouls, is all Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh doctrine; thus it is very eaſy to ſee who theſe people are, and to what body or church they belong; and if it was written of the church of Rome, Miſtery, Babylon the great, the mother of harlots and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the earth; ſo may it be written of this people, Miſtery, Rome the mother of witchcraſts, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>It may alſo be obſerved that the exact reſemblance of this people appeared in England in the year 1706 and 1707, brought in by two or three French pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets (ſo called,) who went on with their propheſies, ſhakeings, unknown tongues, &amp;c. which prevailed for a time, and took in many into the deluſive ſcheme, but finally worked itſelf out and died in ſhame and contempt.</p>
            <p>Since therefore we are all expoſed and liable to be taken in the ſnares of Satan, let it exite one all to ſanctify the Lord God in their hearts, and let him be our fear and our dread, ſince the fear of the Lord is a fountain of life to depart from the ſnares of death. For he ſpake thus to me with a ſtrong hand, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:018310_0014_0FA5C8E58FAA4100"/>me that I ſhould not walk in the way of this people. Saying, Say ye not a confederacy to all them to whom this people ſhall ſay a confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid; ſanctify the Lord of hoſts himſelf, and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread. And when they ſhall ſay unto you, ſeek unto them that have famliar ſpirits, and unto wizards that peep, and mutter: ſhould not a people ſeek unto their God: for the living, to the dead? TO the law and to the teſtimony: if they ſpeak not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this word, it is becauſe there is no light in them. Iſaiah, viii. II—13, 19, 20.</p>
