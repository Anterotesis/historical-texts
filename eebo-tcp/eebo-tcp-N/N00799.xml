            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN this Context we have an Hiſtory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is alſo recorded in two other, <hi>Evangelists, viz. Matthew,</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> though variouſly as to ſeveral<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> paſſages that are inſerted in one, and omitted in the other. I may not ſpend the time in laying open all the particulars in this Narration; every whereof would afford matter of inſtruction. The Theological Scope of it is to let us ſee how far a natural man may go in the improvement of his <hi>Moral powers,</hi> and yet miſs of eternal life at laſt; exemplified in a young and noble man of the Jewiſh Nation, as he is repreſented by the other <hi>Evangeliſts.</hi> This man, doubtleſs
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000962_0003_0FADE59031F12030"/>
had not only heard of Chriſt, but had alſo heard him, and been affected with his Preaching; and, being convinced of a future everlaſting ſtate, is concerned how he may <hi>obtain eternal Life</hi> in it: accordingly he comes running to Chriſt, expreſſing much veneration of him, both in words and geſtures, and propounds to him the moſt important queſtion that he could, <hi>viz. How he may come to inherit eternal life</hi>: though, in the manner of his enquiry, he expreſt a legal ſpirit, and intimated that he hoped to be Saved by doing, <hi>What ſhall I do, &amp;c.</hi> Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our treats him courteouſly, and yet cloſely; he giveth him good language, but yet ſearcheth him; and, knowing the deceitfulneſs of his heart, reſolves to diſcover it to him, and others too. He therefore firſt puts him upon the duties of the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> where he knew that his great preſumption lay, and in which he determined to diſcover him; directing him to conformity thereto: the ſelf Conceited man doth plumply and with great confidence aſſert his conſtancy in theſe obſervations; that he hath obſerved <hi>all theſe from his youth,</hi> and would fain know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this were not ſufficient, or if any thing more were wanting, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.20. <hi>What lack I yet?</hi> Our Saviour is ſaid, <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. <hi>To look upon him, and love him</hi>; which is not to be underſtood of a Divine love, at leaſt not of ſuch as he bears to his own, or ſuch whom he hath made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000962_0004_0FADE5915E933D70"/>
in his grace: but with an humane affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is due to ingenuous men, though they be meer moraliſts: and therefore, as he was not miſtaken in him, ſo he goes on to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect him. That which he ſummarily mentions in our <hi>Text</hi> is, that there is a flaw in that which he is ſo conceited of, that there is ſomething deficient: and, to let him know what this was, and that he was as yet a ſtranger at home, and did not know himſelf, he puts him upon a trial, in which the naughtineſs of his heart preſently diſcovered it ſelf. <hi>Christ</hi> did not openly charge him with falſehood, as well he might, and tell him that he had not indeed kept one of theſe commands aright, but he puts him upon a <hi>Teſt</hi> by which he might judge himſelf, and diſcover how little ſafety there was in his condition. Out of doubt, this young man was an eminent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a <hi>Legal Moralist,</hi> and one that had, with a great deal of <hi>Conſcience</hi> and <hi>Integrity</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured an univerſal conformity to the Law, not only in the <hi>Ceremonial,</hi> but alſo in the <hi>Moral</hi> part of it, and hoped for acceptance and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward on account of his <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi> But Chriſt detects the deceit; and, though he might have told him that he wanted many things, yet there was one that was the ground of all, and there needed no more to defeat his blooming ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations. In the <hi>Greek</hi> it it, <hi>there is one thing lacking to thee.</hi> And the word ſignifies, to <hi>fall
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000962_0005_0FADE5919E284A88"/>
behind</hi> of the thing aimed at, and is a <hi>Metaphor</hi> from ſuch as <hi>run</hi> in a <hi>race,</hi> but never come to the <hi>Goal,</hi> but ſit down ſhort of it, and thereupon do in the iſſue miſs of the <hi>prize</hi> which was ſet up at it: and that which our Saviour here intends, is that there was ſometing wanting, which would make him to miſs of eternal life. The word uſed in <hi>Luke</hi> 18.22. ſignifies that which is <hi>left behind,</hi> or is wanting to compleat a thing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which it remains imperfect, and cannot anſwer the end aimed at in it. Hence,</p>

               <head>QUESTION. What is that one thing the lack whereof will ſpoil the beſt Morality in men?</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſhall not here ſpend time in inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating the particular flaw which Chriſt laid open in this mans Obedience; for it is beyond juſt diſpute<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that our Saviours deſign in this trial, was to convince him of the nature of his malady, and lead him to the root from which it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded; which by ſuch a proof he laid open: and what that is, we may now make ſearch after: and, to make way to this, and obviate thoſe prejudices, which proud men will wait for an occaſion of, that ſo they may calumniate our preſent <hi>Doctrine,</hi> we may purſue it in the following <hi>Concluſions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That moral Obedience is due to God from all mankind.</hi> The Jews, when the Goſpel was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, were ready to charge Evangelical Preaching as if it made void the Law, which the Apoſtle utterly denies, and aſſerts the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.31. <hi>Do we make void the law through faith? God forbid: ye we eſtabliſh the law.</hi> The moral Law was adapted to the nature of man, as he was placed under the ſpecial Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God. When God ſpeaks of the Ceremonial law, he uſeth ſuch a word as that, <hi>Ezek.</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:000962_0007_0FADE59317F2EF88"/>
20.25. <hi>I gave them ſtatutes that were not good.</hi> Not as if they were not good in reſpect of the uſe which they were appointed for, for that would have been an impeachment of Gods wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: but they were ſuch as in themſelves bind an heavy and inſupportable burden upon thoſe who were under the obligation of them, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.10. <hi>A yoke which neither we, nor our fathers were able to bear</hi>; and they only ſerved for the time being, which was a ſtate of Servitude un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which the Church of God was held, during its nonage; and even then when theſe were of force; we are told in, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9 9. <hi>That they could not make him that did the ſervice perfect, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the Conſcience.</hi> Whereas the <hi>Moral Law</hi> was ſuited to man, and every way proper to his nature, and relation which in it he bare to God, it hath therefore that encomium given to it, which it can never loſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.12. <hi>The law is holy, and the commandment holy, and juſt, and good.</hi> The obligation therefore to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to this law is perpetual, and the Children of God, though brought under the <hi>New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> do yet owe it; and it lies upon them as a conſtant duty, to ſtudy and endeavour after the greateſt <hi>perfection</hi> in it, according to Chriſts own precept given in, <hi>Matt.</hi> 5. <hi>ult. Be ye perfect, as your father which is in heaven is perfect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That there is a great deal which a man may do in morality, by the improvement of his natural
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000962_0008_0FADE593D18590B0"/>
powers, with the common aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God.</hi> We are here warily to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Moral Powers</hi> which belong to the nature of man, and the <hi>Moral Image</hi> which was connatural to him in his ſtate of integrity: this latter indeed is loſt by the <hi>Apoſtaſy,</hi> but the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer abides, as belonging eſſentially to Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though this is very much crazed, and hath loſt a great deal of its vigour. And, although the power of luſt be ſo ſtrong in natural men, that they cannot of themſelves alone withſtand the impetuoſity of it, yet the <hi>Moral Powers</hi> which remain in the man, may be ſo far improved by the common influences of the Spirit of God, which he affords to ſome, on whom he doth not beſtow his Sanctifying Grace, as to make a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man to proceed far in compliance with the Law. This may be inſtanced more eſpecially in four particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A man may maintain an univerſal outward conformity to the letter of the Law, ſo far as to be blameleſs among men.</hi> It is true, he can do no one act of Obedience unto Gods Law, that is entirely ſo, for ſuch an act muſt ſtand forth in all its cauſes entirely, which doth altogether exceed the power of any of <hi>Adams</hi> Apoſtate race: But he may be careful in his Converſation, and carry it ſo <hi>circumſpectly</hi> in all his actions that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the view of men, as to obſerve them, and conform to them with great curiouſneſs,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000962_0009_0FADE59492766508"/>
according to his underſtanding of them. And thus this noble young man mentioned in our <hi>context</hi> was of opinion that he had done, and <hi>Paul</hi> after his Converſion, when he reflected on his law ſtate, could aſſert that he had lived after this ſort, in, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Touching the Righteouſneſs which is in the law blameleſs. i e.</hi> without incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the imputation of Scandal from men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>He may be very Conſcientious in all this.</hi> There is a Conſcience active in the natural man; and, though it is defiled with ſin, as every thing elſe in the man is, yet it is capable of being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved in him, ſo as to diſcover to, and convince him of the reaſon and equity of theſe and thoſe duties, the brutiſhneſs and unreaſonableneſs of ſuch and ſuch ſins, the moral evil which there is in theſe, and the moral goodneſs in thoſe, ſo as to oblige him from an inward principle to do this, and abſtain from that. There is a <hi>Moral Integrity</hi> in men, and prevails in ſome, that leads them to do things, not <hi>Hypocritically,</hi> but <hi>Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly.</hi> We may ſuppoſe <hi>Abimelech</hi> to plead to this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for we have no Scripture evidence that he had reached any higher, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.5. <hi>In the integ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of my heart, and innocency of my hands have I done this</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And God herein conſents to the truth of this aſſertion, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 6. <hi>I know that thou didſt this in the integrity of thine heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>He may take a great deal of delight in thus doing.</hi> The very <hi>Heathen Moraliſts,</hi> who only
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:000962_0010_0FADE595B8C09468"/>
followed the light of nature, could boaſt that they found incomparably more of pleaſure and ſatisfaction, in the exerciſe of their <hi>Vertues,</hi> than the greateſt ſenſualliſts could poſſibly do in their fleſhly pleaſures, and could reject theſe with ſcorn for thoſe. The <hi>Moraliſt</hi> doth not put a force upon his whole nature, though he may ſuppreſs ſome exorbitant motions of it, when he abſtains from the things that the generality im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merge themſelves in, and lives contrary to the current of the times and places he lives in; but he gratifies his <hi>Moral Principles,</hi> when he curbs in theſe which are <hi>ſenſual.</hi> Mens <hi>Affections</hi> work naturally, when they are moved by the impreſſions of Reaſon in them, for it belongs to the nature of man, that he is a reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. God therefore concedes that to men whom he yet reproves as falſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.2. <hi>They ask of me the ordinances of Justice, they take delight in approaching to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>He may do it with an aim at obtaining of eternal life in this way.</hi> Thus the noble young man inſtanced in our <hi>Context</hi> ſeems to have done, inaſmuch as he would know if this would not do. The natural man maintains his cravings after felicity, and hath not loſt his apprehenſions of an eternal ſtate, and conſequently is deſirous of ſetling a permanent happineſs, and to this his actions deſignedly tend, how ever he may be miſtaken in the <hi>Medium.</hi> He knows that there
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000962_0011_0FADE596281DB6E0"/>
muſt be a way to this, and he is in ſearch after it, and makes it his enquiry, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Many there be that ſay, who will ſhew us good?</hi> And the <hi>Legaliſt</hi> looks upon his own Righteouſneſs to be the way, and accordingly he proſecutes it with ſuch an aim: yea indeed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this is the very legal Spirit in man, that he thinks to obtain it thus: ſo it was with the <hi>Jews</hi> in the Apoſtles time, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.32. <hi>They ſought Righteouſneſs, not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>Morality helps the man to be Serviceable to mankind in his Generation.</hi> It is <hi>a gift of God,</hi> for man to be helped to exert theſe principles which are in them, and for that reaſon is to be acknowledged and not deſpiſed. It is ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to Gods <hi>Common Government,</hi> in conducting of the affairs of this lower world; and in this regard a <hi>Moral</hi> man may be ſaid to be a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in the place where he lives, and is uſeful for the publick benefit; and God makes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of theſe for ſuch an end. If all the world were given up to, and drenched in all manner of Immoralities, there would be no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for mankind one with another, but the whole world would ſoon be reduced to a <hi>Chaos,</hi> whereas this fits the man for publick Service; ſuch an one was <hi>Saul,</hi> by virtue of thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon gifts that God beſtowed on him, when he was made King over <hi>Iſrael</hi>; and he continued ſo to be, till <hi>the Spirit of God departed from him.</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="unknown:000962_0012_0FADE596D276C6B0"/>
Such an one may be helpful to the Children of God; and that both by his counſel, and his example, and ſo was <hi>Achitophel</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> before he went off in <hi>Abſaloms</hi> Rebellion, Pſal. 55.13, 14. <hi>Mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance; we took ſweet counſel together, and walked to the Houſe of God in company.</hi> And doubtleſs ſuch was <hi>Demas</hi> to <hi>Paul,</hi> before he forſook him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>There are many preſent outward advantages that the man may gain to himſelf by it.</hi> There are ſeveral benefits which in this life men get by their morality, in the ordinary courſe of Gods Providence. The man hereby maintains his credit or reputation among men; it wins the good word of all that are ſober; whereas im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality expoſeth men to be the ſcorn of all, but thoſe that are their companions in debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery. It keeps the man from thoſe courſes which would of their own nature prove ruinous to him, in reſpect of his eſtate, peace, health and life. It gives the man more quiet of Conſcience, and prevents thoſe horrors which immoral men draw upon themſelves by their ſinning againſt the light that is in them: for the Conſcience of a Legaliſt is wont ordinarily to treat him according as it hath reſentments of his carriage towards the Law which is imprinted upon it, <hi>Rom</hi> 2.14, 15. <hi>Theſe are a law to themſelves, which ſhew the work of the Law written upon their hearts; their conſciences alſo bearing witneſs, and
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:000962_0013_0FADE599B9D89FD0"/>
their thoughts mean while, either accuſing or elſe excuſing one another.</hi> And it procures the man many temporal bleſſings from God in the courſe of his common Providence; Men fare the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in this world oftentimes for this: for tho' meer <hi>Morality</hi> doth not procure Gods ſpecial love for men, yet the <hi>Morality</hi> it ſelf is ſo far a duty, and God many times favours men in temporary benefits on the account hereof; and it prevents calamities which otherwiſe might have overtaken them: hence that advice given, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.17. <hi>Be not overmuch wicked, neither be thou fooliſh, why ſhouldeſt thou dy before thy time?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The Moral Obedience of the Children of God, is Serviceable to their Eternal Felicity.</hi> The truth of this aſſertion is queſtioned by none but ſuch as are downright <hi>Antinomian</hi>; though, how far, and after what manner it is ſo, affords occaſion for hot diſputes. There is a moral Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the want whereof will exclude a man from the Kingdom, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Except your righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs exceed the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, ye ſhall in no caſe enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> There is a <hi>Holineſs, without which no man ſhall ſee God, Heb.</hi> 12.14. This is ſo far from being diſcharged by the Goſpel Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that it teacheth it, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12. <hi>The Grace of God which brings Salvation, hath appeared to all men; teaching us that denying ungodlineſs and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000962_0014_0FADE59AD5957F58"/>
in this preſent world.</hi> There are therefore many and great promiſes made in the Goſpel to the faithful obedience of the Children of God: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>ult. Knowing that your labour ſhall not be in vain, in the Lord. Gal</hi> 6.9. <hi>Be not weary of well doing, for in due time you ſhall reap if you faint not.</hi> Rev. 2.10. <hi>Be thou faithful unto the death, and I will give thee a Crown of Life</hi>; Rom. 2.7. <hi>To them that by patient continuance in well doing, ſeek for glory, honour, and immortality, eternal life.</hi> Far be it from any to think, that the Goſpel doth either give men a diſcharge from the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Obedience to Gods Commands, or that it doth not encourage it with the promiſe of eternal rewards.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>But meer morality will leave the man ſhort of Eternal Life, and under the Curſe of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Death.</hi> All men in their natural ſtate are under the Curſe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Were children of wrath by nature, even as others.</hi> And whiles this abides on them, they muſt needs be far from life, for theſe two are contraries. In vain then do men ſeek any other courſe to advance their everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing welfare, but ſuch as may reſcue them from that Curſe. That man cannot be leſs than mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable on whom the Wrath of God abides; Chriſt therefore ſo expreſſeth ſinful mans miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Joh. 3.36. <hi>The wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> The man alſo muſt be put into the way of life, if ever he obtain it, but meer morality will not
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:000962_0015_0FADE59B5C489DA8"/>
do this, but leave him infinitely ſhort of it, as will preſently appear.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>The reaſon of this is, becauſe the man, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his</hi> Morality, <hi>wants one thing to render his perſon and obedience acceptable to God.</hi> Out of doubt God hath the diſpoſal of life and death in his own hands: <hi>his loving kindneſs is better than life,</hi> and his Wrath carries in it death and ruine to all ſuch as muſt finally undergo it. Let a man take never ſo much pains in his Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and be at never ſo much coſt in the doing of them, yet, if at the laſt God will not accept of them at his hands, but reject both them and him, they will nothing avail him. Now it is certain, that there is that which is defective in the moſt operoſe and ſpecious ſervice of the <hi>Moraliſt,</hi> which renders it far from pleaſing God, ſo as to crown it with a reward of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, &amp; thereby renders it unſerviceable to him in order to <hi>eternal life,</hi> and that we may find out what this <hi>one thing</hi> is, and not be miſtaken about it, we may trace the thing it ſelf, and be ſatisfied about the reaſon of its deficiency in this regard, in the following Aſſertions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In that moral obedience to which life was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the Firſt Covenant, there was required an exact conformity to the Rule therein given to man, which none of fallen men can attain unto.</hi> There was not only a morality required of man by the precept, for ſo there is ſtill, and will be as long
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:000962_0016_0FADE59C838B8820"/>
as the ſpecial Government of God continues: but a conſtant life of happineſs was Entailed upon it by promiſe, in caſe man had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with it: but this was in the <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> the language whereof we are told, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5. <hi>Moſes deſcribes the Righteouſneſs which is of the law; that the man which doth theſe things ſhall live by them.</hi> But then, the Obedience on which this promiſe might come to be claimed, was ſuch as entirely anſwered the Law in its full demands, without any the leaſt defect; for we are told, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.</hi> That Covenant did not run in ſuch a ſtrain, let the man do the beſt he can, and that ſhall be accepted of him, and he ſhall live; though it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that it required nothing more than man could then do, inaſmuch as the Law was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dequate to the powers that God put into man, and the Image of God which he then had up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, contained in it a power commenſurate with his duty: but yet, it commanded entire and perfect conformity to the will of God; and therefore it is a vain thing for ſinful men to ſay, they do to the beſt of their power, and what more can be expected of them? for, if by ſin they have loſt that power which God once gave unto man, leſs then which will not do to enable him to perform entire obedience
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:000962_0017_0FADE59CECD0AFD0"/>
to the precept, ſhould he ſay true, that he doth to his utmoſt, it ſignifieth nothing, as long as that is ſhort of the command. But it is certain that none living hath ſuch an ability remaining in him The Apoſtle ſaith, in 1 <hi>Joh</hi> 1.8. <hi>If we ſay that we have no ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us</hi>; and the wiſe man makes that challenge, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.9. <hi>Who can ſay, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my ſin?</hi> Yea that is true of the beſt of men here, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.2. <hi>In many things we offend all</hi>; and this leaves every man that ſtands related to that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant under a Curſe, according to, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>As many as are of the works of the Law, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Curſe; for it is written, Curſed is every one that continues not in all things that are written in the book of the law to do them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Apoſtaſy hath made man a debtor to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging Juſtice, for which his perſonal Obedience cannot ſatisfy.</hi> The Covenant of Works, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which man was at firſt placed, had not only in it, a promiſe of <hi>life</hi> made to perfect Obedience, but alſo a threatning of <hi>death</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced in caſe of Diſobedience. We are therefore told, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. <hi>The wages of ſin is death</hi>; it was due to man upon agreement, in caſe that he ſhould tranſgreſs; and this <hi>Sanction</hi> of that Covenant was of equal force with the former, and God ſtands in Juſtice as much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to this as to that; accordingly the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:000962_0018_0FADE59D9A8EACF0"/>
was delivered with the greateſt aſſeverati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Gen</hi> 2.17. <hi>In the day thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt ſurely dy.</hi> So that now the caſe is quite al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with the man, in regard of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, from what it was at the firſt: for, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Relation of all men, whiles they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in their natural eſtate, which they bear unto that <hi>Covenant,</hi> abides, and they are to be tried and judged according to the tenour of it, and as they come under this or that Sanction of it: yet the promiſe of life, as it was made on the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of perfect obedience, doth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide, nor is any longer to be uſed as an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to fallen man. Once God ſaid, <hi>This do, and live</hi>; but he doth not ſay ſo now; for the man is come ſhort of this, being by ſin fallen under the threatning, and is utterly loſt as to the promiſe; ſo that not only is it in vain for him to think to <hi>do and live,</hi> in regard of that impotency which is fallen upon him, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him <hi>without ſtrength</hi>; but upon the ſuppoſal that he could now henceforward do, as perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as <hi>Adam</hi> could before he loſt his power, yet there is no life for him by that Covenant, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21. <hi>If there had been a law given which could have given life</hi>; (i. e. <hi>to fallen man) verily righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs ſhould have been by the Law.</hi> And the reaſon is, becauſe a Curſe is upon him for diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedince; and all his doing can never expiate it; it is but his preſent quit rent, and will not
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:000962_0019_0FADE59E5F95A1E0"/>
make up former arrears; hence that advice, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.10. <hi>When ye have done all thoſe things that are commanded you, ſay, we are unprofitable Servants; we have done that which was our duty to do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The acceptableneſs of the imperfect obedience of ſinful men, is derived through a New-Covenant, to which the Moraliſt is a stranger.</hi> Though the Firſt Covenant accepted of nothing but what was in all points perfect, yet the Covenant of Grace doth. It is certain that there are ſome whoſe not only <hi>perſons</hi> but <hi>ſervices</hi> too are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by God, and he ſmells a ſweet ſavour in them. This is not becauſe they have recovered a ſinleſs perfection, or that any of their duties are without defects attending them; no; they profeſs the quite contrary, ſo did he, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Not as if I had already attained, either were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy perfect</hi>; and hence is fain to deprecate a law trial, as knowing that he is not able to ſtand it, but it will condemn him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.2. <hi>Enter not into judgment with thy ſervant, for in thy ſight ſhall no man living be juſtifyed.</hi> For this acceptance therefore he muſt be removed from the Old Covenant, which ſpeaks nothing but terror to him, and be brought under a new one; which is therefore called, <hi>the bringing in of a better hope, Heb.</hi> 7.19. This Covenant hath declared a way which God hath found out to cover the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and accept of the ſincerity of ſuch as are
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:000962_0020_0FADE59F13125300"/>
in it, conſiſtent with the Juſtice of God, and for the manifeſtation of his <hi>Grace.</hi> Now the moral man, as ſuch, hath no claim to the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and ſaving priviledges of this Covenant, nor doth he deſire it, counting that he can do well enough without it; however he may, by an external relation, have a claim to Goſpel priviledges in the outward diſpenſation of them; yet he is really under the Law, and therefore muſt ſtand or fall according to the ſentence of it.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>In this Covenant there is a new principle requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, from which all acceptable Obedience muſt flow, viz. Faith.</hi> We are told, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>That without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> And hence, all the truly commendable and accptable ſervices, are ſaid to be done <hi>by Faith.</hi> For this therefore it is neceſſary that not only there be a principle of ſaving ſaith in the man, elſe he can do nothing believingly, but there muſt be the exerting of it in every act of New obedience, if ever God will receive it. A man may pray as formally, and uſe as ſuitable and pathetical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in it as can be, but if he do not pray in faith, all is loſt, and his prayers are but <hi>how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi>: hence that direction and caution, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.5, 6, 7. <hi>Let him ask of God; but let him ask in faith, nothing wavering; for let not ſuch a man think that he ſhall receive any thing of the Lord</hi>; and <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.22. <hi>All things whatſoever ye ſhall
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:000962_0021_0FADE59FE9202320"/>
ask in prayer, believing, ye ſhall receive.</hi> A perſon may hear the word with great attention, and receive it with much affection, <hi>the ſtony ground hearers, reeeived it with joy, Mat.</hi> 13.20. But it will not <hi>profit him,</hi> unleſs he <hi>receive it mixed with faith, Heb</hi> 4.2. And the like may be ſaid of all other duties.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>This faith hath Christ for its object, on whom it entirely relies for Salvation.</hi> As <hi>we are ſaved by grace,</hi> ſo it is <hi>through faith, Eph.</hi> 2.8. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this faith there is no Salvation to be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by us, for <hi>he that believeth not ſhall be damned, Mark</hi> 16.16. Which faith is not a bare credit of the truths recorded in the Word of God, &amp; thoſe Theological Doctrines that are revealed therein, though this alſo be neceſſary unto it; but it centers upon Chriſt as the object that is therein revealed, and offered in the promiſe, on whom it placeth its whole dependance for life and ſalvation; and is therefore called <hi>a believing in him,</hi> and to the ſo believing, eternal life is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Whoſoever believeth in him, ſhall not periſh, but have everlasting life</hi>; which dependance muſt be limited to him, and not be divided with any other, becauſe our ſalvation is from him alone, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.12. <hi>Neither is there ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in any other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>The influence of this faith into our moral Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, to render it acceptable unto God, and ſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to our ſalvation</hi>: is mainly in theſe three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="23" facs="unknown:000962_0022_0FADE5A34FF06DD8"/>1. <hi>It makes us ſenſible of our own ſelf-inſufficiency, &amp; drives us to Chriſt alone, for his ſtrength to enable us.</hi> The Moraliſt doth all his duties in his own ſtrength, nor is he concerned to ſeek any out of himſelf: but the true believer doth his in the ſtrength of Chriſt, he ſaith as <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 4.13. <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eneth me.</hi> By the eye of faith he ſees that as he hath no ſufficiency of his own for any thing, ſo that he muſt have it all from him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Not that we are ſufficient of our ſelves, to think any thing as of our ſelves, but our ſufficiency is of God.</hi> He therefore dares not to ſet about any thing, without looking up to him for his aid: all his undertakings are with ſuch a reference, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.32. <hi>I will run the way of thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when thou ſhalt have enlarged my heart, Cant.</hi> 1.4 <hi>Draw me, we will run after thee.</hi> If he reſolves upon any thing, it is with a reliance here, <hi>Pſal·</hi> 71.16. <hi>I will go in the ſtrength of the Lord God.</hi> And if he doth any thing well, he pays the acknowledgment of it hither, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. <hi>Not I, but the Grace of God which was with me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It convinceth us of the imperfection of our beſt duties, ſo as to remove our dependance on them, and make us to ſeek a pardon of their ſhort coming, thro' the blood of Chriſt.</hi> Faith makes us apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive that we can be <hi>accepted only in the beloved Eph.</hi> 1.6. It makes us to confeſs with the Church,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:000962_0023_0FADE5A4AA139F28"/>

Our Obedience is not put in the room of a <hi>Propitiatory Sacrifice,</hi> but only is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as a <hi>Thank-Offering</hi> to God, in teſtimony of the infinite obligation laid upon us by his gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of his Son for us; we renounce all our own Righteouſneſs in the bottom, that ſo we may be built upon that of Chriſt; as he, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Be found in him, not having mine own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs which is of the Law, but that which is thro' the faith of Chriſt.</hi> We acknowledge that theſe

Services are ſo far from deſerving a reward, that it is only free grace that receives them of us; and that it is for Chriſt's ſake that we are ſo received.</p>

He hath a Righteouſneſs of his own, which he ſets up in contradiction to the Righteouſneſs of faith, that is revealed in the Goſpel; and becauſe theſe two are inconſiſtent, and the one of them will neceſſarily drive out the other; the pride of his heart maintains his own, and that will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to ſubmit to the other. This was the folly and miſery of thoſe Jews, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

Here then we have found out what is the <hi>one thing</hi> that is <hi>lacking,</hi> &amp; in the lack of that, every thing elſe is deficient, and all his labour is loſt. And the reaſon of all this is, becauſe Chriſt is the <hi>Mediator</hi> of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> who hath alone made the atonement, and opened the way to life by his obedience, ſo that <hi>Juſtice and Mercy may meet together</hi> in the Salvation of Sinners; which, according to the tenour of the New-Covenant, can derive to none but by <hi>Faith</hi> in him, whoſe perfect righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs hath made way for the acceptance of the imperfect but ſincere Services of true belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>

                  <hi>Hence what caution had Goſpel Miniſters need to uſe in their preaching up of moral duties?</hi> That it is their duty to preach them, and preſs them upon their hearers, is certain; otherwiſe they cannot be faithful in <hi>declaring the whole Counſel of God</hi>: and yet if they ſo preach them as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the Covenant of Works, to advance the Righteouſneſs of man, and depreciate the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, they are far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Miniſters of Chriſt,</hi> and are indeed the very betrayers of Souls to deſtruction, as far as in them lieth.

any thing which doth more threaten the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining of true Chriſtianity, and the bringing in of another Goſpel, than the putting of <hi>Moral Vertues</hi> into a legal dreſs, and without any more ado, to commend them to us as the <hi>Graces</hi> of our Chriſtian Religion.
