            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>O THOU ever bleſſed and adorable Redeemer, who art God over all bleſſed for evermore, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry be to thy free grace, who haſt promiſed that where two or three are gathered together thou wilt be in the midſt of them: Be in the midſt of us, gracious God, at this time; let thy power be known and felt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us; draw near unto us at this, and at every op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity; when we draw near unto thee, in thy pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſervice, may we find thee a God nigh unto us in all that we call upon thee for.—But will God, in very deed, dwell with men on the earth? Behold, Heaven and the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain thee; how much leſs theſe houſes that are built for thy worſhip and ſervice? Yet have reſpect to the prayer of thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy ſervant, and to his ſupplication. O Lord my God, hearken unto the cry, and the prayer, which thy ſervant prayeth before thee. O that thine eyes may be open upon this houſe, day and night, which we are now aſſembled to dedicate and ſet apart to thy worſhip and ſervice. Bleſs this chapel in a peculiar manner with thy divine preſence; bleſs all that ſhall at any time admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter thy holy word and ſacraments in this place; may they be men called and fitted by thee for their ſacred offices: Endue them with a divine power; make them ſucceſsful in all their miniſtrations, that ſpiritual chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may here be born unto thee. Bleſs all thy people that ſhall at any time aſſemble in this houſe to meet thee in thine ordinances; may they not depart without a bleſſing, and enjoy communion and fellowſhip with thee, the Father of their mercies, and the God of all their conſolation. Clothe thy prieſts with righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and make thy ſaints ſhout aloud for joy.

            </epigraph>
            <p>THESE words our dear Redeemer ſpoke to his Diſciples, and in them to all ſucceeding ages of the church, as an encouragement to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in every generation to aſſemble themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in his name, to offer their prayers and praiſes unto him who hath called them out of darkneſs into his marvellous light, to meet together for the due celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all divine ordinances, and to pay every act of divine worſhip to him who hath tranſlated them from the power of <hi>Satan</hi> into the kingdom of God.</p>
            <p>IN the former part of the chapter he had been teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them a leſſon of humility, by ſetting a little child before them, as an anſwer to their queſtion, Who is the greateſt in the kingdom of Heaven? and told them, except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye ſhall not enter therein.</p>
            <p>AND, having taught them how to behave towards offending brethren, he proceeds in the verſe before our text: Again I ſay unto you, if two of you ſhall agree on earth, as touching any thing that they ſhall aſk, it ſhall be done for them of my Father, who is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; for—where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midſt of them. <hi>If two of you,</hi> who are united to me by faith, ſhall agree, ſhall be of one mind, <hi>as touching any thing</hi> you ſtand in need of for the advancement of your temporal or eternal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and ſhall be deſirous of making known your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt by prayer and ſupplication unto God, and ſhall aſk in faith, and in ſuch a manner as is well-pleaſing in

            </p>
            <p>BELOVED—This day we are aſſembled in order to ſet apart this place for worſhipping the greateſt and beſt of beings, the moſt high God, the poſſeſſor of Heaven and earth, the God who ruleth over all, but who is the covenant God of the real Chriſtian, his great Creator, his all-merciful Redeemer and ever-bleſſed Sanctifier; and this office hath devolved upon unworthy me. Had it been the will of him who doth as he pleaſes among the armies of Heaven, and among the inhabiters of the earth, on whom the lives of all men depend, that the founder of this houſe had been continued to have ſeen the utmoſt of his deſires compleated, in regard to this inſtitution, and to have himſelf ſpoken to us on this occaſion, with what pleaſure ſhould I have attended, and, I believe I may add, with what pleaſure would moſt of you have attended to the words in ſeaſon, which no doubt he would have delivered with his uſual energy on this ſolemnity.</p>
            <p>BUT the ſupreme diſpoſer of all human events hath ſeen fit to order it otherwiſe, and in this providence ſpeaketh unto us as he did unto <hi>Peter</hi> on another oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion:
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012034_0010_0F8971AEBB8463A0"/>
What I do, thou knoweſt not now, but thou ſhalt know hereafter, as tho' he ſaid, if thou art waiting upon me in the ways of my appointment, and depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon my divine teaching, tho' thou ſeeſt not the reaſon of my actions, and knoweſt not NOW what I do, that is, the reaſon of my ſo doing, thou ſhalt know it hereafter, when thy faith is ſwallowed up in enjoyment, thy hope turned into fruition, and thy love made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the kingdom of my glory; then, and not before, thou ſhalt ſee that all my proceedings with the children of men were ordered for the beſt, and ſo as to ſecure my glory and their good.</p>
            <p>IT is therefore our duty to ſubmit and acquieſce in the will of God, and we ſhall find leſs difficulty in ſo doing, if, with an eminent Divine,<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide Doctor Pemberton's ſermon, page 22.</note> in his funeral ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon for our deceaſed friend, we conſider, that, though <q>ſeparated from the ſociety of his friends below, he is united to the nobler ſociety above of Angels and Archangels, and the ſpirits of juſt men made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>WE view him there, not as periſhing in the duſt of death, but as entered into a world of glory. We behold him worſhipping before the throne of God, not with a company of frail imperfect mortals, but with the general aſſembly and church of the firſt-born, ſhining in the unſpotted robes of holineſs, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting in hoſannahs and partaking of their reſpective triumphs.</q> Our loſs therefore is his eternal gain, and, glory be to our good God, if we are of the number of his faithful ſervants, there is the ſame eternal inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, the ſame glorious crown before us; after theſe we are aſpiring, and, if we are preſerved faithful a little longer, the day of death will come, (that happy
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012034_0011_0F8971AFAE654DD8"/>
day to the real believer, that woeful, dreadful day to the men of this world) and put us in full poſſeſſion of them; then, with our deceaſed friend, we ſhall meet around the throne, and join with Cherubims and Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phims, and the whole Hierarchy of Heaven, in aſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſalvation, OUR ſalvation, to God and the Lamb for evermore.</p>
            <p>I HAVE choſen, on this occaſion, the words I have read to you, and in ſome meaſure explained, and hope they are not altogether unſuitable to our preſent meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as they ſtrongly <hi>imply</hi> the duty of aſſembling our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together for the worſhip of God, and more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>expreſs</hi> the advantages we may expect and derive there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from.—Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midſt of them.</p>
            <p>IN this order I intend to diſcourſe upon them, and to draw ſome ſuitable inferences, and may the ſpirit of God help both you and me to make a proper improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole.</p>
            <p>MAN, at firſt created, and ſtill preſerved by him, who is the maker of all things, both in Heaven and earth, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by that God in whom we live, move, and have our being, is under the ſtrongeſt obligation to pay him ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and adoration. It is a principle ſo deeply rooted in man's reaſon and conſcience, that, of all the nations of the earth, few, if any, but what have had ſome me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of teſtifying their belief of a ſupreme being, and have invented ſomething, which they have made their God; to which they have paid ſome kind of honour and worſhip. But to us, who are under the Chriſtian diſpenſation; God has ſo clearly revealed his mind and will, that we ſhall be left entirely without excuſe, if we do not give him the glory due unto his name; a duty incumbent on us to perform, not only in private,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:012034_0012_0F8971B036AE3EC8"/>
and in our families, in our morning and evening ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of devotion, but alſo publickly in thoſe places that are peculiarly ſet apart for his worſhip and ſervice; there we are to aſſemble and meet together to offer up our joint prayers and ſupplications, and to hear his word read and preached by his ſervants, his miniſters, for our mutual edification and comfort.</p>
            <p>AND this, if we are really and truly Chriſtians, we ſhall eſteem our higheſt honour, our greateſt privilege; for we ſhall then, if we are ſuch, attend theſe publick ordinances for religious worſhip, not out of form and cuſtom, as is the caſe with too too many—not merely for an example to others, but to meet our God in them—to enjoy in his houſe communion with him, whoſe preſence is better than life—to hear what God the Lord will ſpeak concerning us, who ſpeaks to his people, and to his ſaints, that they return not to folly.</p>
            <p>FOR theſe reaſons churches, chapels, and publick edifices, are erected, that we may decently and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently worſhip God in publick congregation; but ſorry am I to ſee they are, in general, ſo little frequented. Tho' our duty to God, and the laws of our country, enjoin our attendance, many never enter the inſide of a church, and with what reluctance do others formally attend now and then? They ſeem as it were to drag their bodies only thither, and leave their ſouls behind them. Others ſleep away the time, while others, who can hardly keep their eyes open, ſhew, by their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, how agreeably they are entertained; were you to judge others by their behaviour, you would ſuppoſe them at ſome publick place of diverſion by their light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and indecent carriage: Few, very few, ſeem to be actuated by proper motives, and behave like thoſe who underſtand the important buſineſs they are engaged in. And all the while, they think themſelves very good
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:012034_0013_0F8971B0F3D8B098"/>
Chriſtians, and would be greatly offended to be thought otherwiſe. But is not ſuch a conduct a ſhame to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity? The name without the thing will be of no ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to you; away with ſuch Chriſtianity from the earth. Our Chriſtianity, our religion, is not worth any thing, if it does not influence the whole man, make us wiſer and better, and regulate our whole lives and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Renounce your profeſſion, or live agreeably to it.—For God's, for your ſoul's ſake, live as Chriſtians, or elſe you diſown Chriſtianity. The name without the thing will but aggravate your condemnation.</p>
            <p>AS publick worſhip is the duty of all who are called Chriſtians, therefore let us, if we are really as well as nominally ſo, not forſake the aſſembling ourſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for divine worſhip, as the manner of ſome is, who thereby not only neglect their duty, but deſpiſe their privilege.</p>
            <p>LET ſuch as are real believers exhort one another to a due and conſtant attendance upon publick worſhip, and to wait upon God with a proper and ſuitable frame and temper of mind, and ſo much the more, as we ſee the day, the day of death approaching, which will put a final end to all our worſhip upon earth, on the due improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which depends our worſhipping with the church triumphant in Heaven. Beſide—what great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement does the promiſe in our text afford us to meet in the name of our adorable Redeemer, when he tells us, where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midſt of them. He is graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly preſent with his faithful worſhippers to quicken and enliven their devotion; then with joy they draw wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of the wells of ſalvation, their language is, <q>As the hart panteth after the water-brooks, ſo longeth my ſoul after thee, O God. My ſoul thirſteth for God, for the living God, when ſhall I come and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:012034_0014_0F8971B1B5FD80B0"/>
before God? O how amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord of Hoſts, my ſoul longeth, yea even faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for the courts of the Lord, my heart and my fleſh crieth out for the living God, bleſſed are they that dwell in thy houſe, they will be ſtill praiſing thee, they go from ſtrength to ſtrength, every one of them in <hi>Zion</hi> appeareth before God. A day in thy courts is better than a thouſand. I had rather be a door<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper in the houſe of my God than to dwell in the tents of wickedneſs. O Lord of Hoſts, bleſſed is the man that truſteth in thee.</q>—This is the heart and language of ſpiritual worſhippers.—Such as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God in ſpirit and in truth have a joy in God through our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> a joy that a ſtranger to theſe bleſſings intermeddleth not with. They have a peace which the world cannot give, and, glory be to God, a peace which the world cannot take away. It is their Heaven upon earth to enjoy communion and fellowſhip with the Father of their ſpirits in his ſanctuary. It is Heaven begun in their ſoul, when, with the eye of faith, they ſee him, who is inviſible, preſiding in their worſhipping aſſemblies; when <hi>Jeſus</hi> is preſent with them by his ſpirit, and the ſpirit of God witneſſeth with their ſpirits that they are his children, they then renew their ſtrength by waiting upon the Lord, they mount up with wings as eagles, they run and are not weary, they walk and are not faint. They anticipate the joys of the bleſſed, and have a foretaſte in earneſt of that happineſs they will enjoy when they ſhall join the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly hoſt and ſing the ſong of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Lamb forever and ever.</p>
            <p>FROM what has been ſaid I infer, that, as it is our duty to attend on publick worſhip, and God has been graciouſly pleaſed to condeſcend to encourage us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, by promiſing to be with us to bleſs us, we ought to embrace every opportunity afforded us for this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012034_0015_0F8971B27459EE88"/>
ſervice, not in a formal and cuſtomary manner, but with a due and becoming reverence, under a juſt ſenſe of our unworthineſs, and of the goodneſs and mercy of God, in permitting us, who are but vile earth and miſerable ſinners, to approach his preſence. We ſhould take the advice of <hi>Solomon,</hi> 
               <q>Keep thy foot when thou goeſt to the houſe of God, and be more ready to hear than to give the ſacrifice of fools, for they conſider not that they do evil.</q> 
               <hi>Keep your feet when you go to the houſe of God,</hi> approach his courts with a becoming awe and reverence, enter into his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with due veneration, with a prepared heart and attentive year, and <hi>be more ready to hear,</hi> that you may receive benefit thereby, <hi>than to give the ſacrifice of fools,</hi> than to offer unto God the ſacrifice of the wicked, (who are the greateſt of all fools) which is an abomination unto him, for <hi>they conſider not</hi> they ruſh into his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, as the horſe into the battle, without any thought of the importance of the work they are to be employed about; <hi>they conſider not,</hi> that, when they pretend to be worſhipping God, they are even then among the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the profaners of his name, whom he has poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively declared he will not hold guiltleſs; <hi>they conſider not</hi> that they do evil in the very action, and at the very time, when they are fooliſh enough to imagine they are doing good, even then they are guilty of the moſt abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable hypocriſy. They draw near to God with their mouths when their hearts are far from him. What can be a more ſolemn mockery of the great God than to offer to him the labour of the lip, when the thoughts are like the fool's eyes in the ends of the earth. My ſon, ſays God, give me thy heart, the whole heart, or elſe thy ſacrifice is nothing worth. If the heart is not engaged in his ſervice it is of no avail. Sincerity in his worſhip is what God looks at and is well-pleaſing in his ſight, when we deſire acceptance only in <hi>Jeſus</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved. Sincerity is goſpel perfection; therefore ſee
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:012034_0016_0F8971B335E0FFD0"/>
that you be ſincere in all your addreſſes at the throne of grace; be in earneſt; let your whole heart and all your affections be ſeriouſly engaged when you attend ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and then you will be accepted. God will be found of you, if you ſeek him aright, and <hi>your heart,</hi> and the hearts of all ſhall rejoice that ſeek the Lord in ſincerity.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, as our Lord has promiſed to be mercifully preſent where two or three are gathered together in his name, it is by no means improper to erect and raiſe ſuitable and decent buildings to be ſet apart peculiarly for his ſervice, not that there is any intrinſick holineſs in the buildings, they are only relatively holy, ſo far as they are made uſe of for God's worſhip. It is not the walls that conſtitute the church, however beautiful the ſtructure, however highly ornamented, and richly deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated. The church, according to our 19th article, is defined to be a congregation of faithful men, in the which the pure word of God is preached, and the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments duly adminiſtered according to <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, in all thoſe things that of neceſſity are requiſite to the ſame, and in our communion ſervice, the bleſſed company of all faithful people, every member incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in the myſtical body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> heirs through hope of God's everlaſting kingdom, by the merits of the moſt precious death and paſſion of his dear Son, are conſidered in holy fellowſhip.</p>
            <p>LASTLY, as we are this day met, and ſolemnly to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, by the word of God and prayer, this Chapel, for the worſhip and ſervice of our great Creator,—O that he may make it ſuch a place as he has choſen, may it be ſanctified by his divine preſence, whenever two or three, or a larger number, are gathered together here in his name, there may he be in the midſt of them. O that it may never want a company of faithful people to aſſemble therein, and a faithful Miniſter to lead and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:012034_0017_0F8971B402B50228"/>
in their devotions; that God's pure word may be preached with abundant ſucceſs; that ſinners may be converted, the weak lambs of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s flock ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and refreſhed, and the ſtrong edified and built up in the word and doctrine, that they may adorn the goſpel of God their Saviour in all things. May the holy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments be duly adminiſtered in this place according to <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ordinance, that all who are partakers thereof may receive, with the outward viſible ſigns, the inward and ſpiritual grace, which may be to them certain ſure witneſſes of effectual ſigns of God's good-will towards them, and may work inviſibly in them, and not only quicken, but alſo ſtrengthen and confirm their faith in him, that they, perſevering and enduring to the end, may be ſaved with an eternal and everlaſting ſalvation.</p>
            <p>TO conclude,—let us one and all work while it is day, while the day of life laſts, for the night, the night of death cometh, when no man can work.</p>
            <p>O SIRS, make it your chief ſtudy, your conſtant care and only aim, to ſeek the Lord while he is to be found, and call upon him while he is near; he is to be found now, to-day, if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts; behold, now is the accepted time, behold, now is the day of ſalvation. He is near to you in his ordinances, and if you call in earneſt upon him, he will hear you, and give an anſwer of peace. Take heed that you do not deſpiſe his calls and neglect his invitations, leſt he ſhould ſwear in his wrath concerning you, they ſhall not enter into my reſt. Remember, Sirs, time is ſhort, death is certain, the hour of your departure very uncertain; an eternity of happineſs or miſery depends upon your improving or miſimproving the few days al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted you. There is no repentance in the grave, to which we are all haſtening. As the tree falleth, ſo it muſt lie; as the day of death leaves you, the day of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012034_0018_0F8971B4B6CBAA08"/>
judgment will find you, and if you live and die in a ſtate of ſin, without repentance, there will be no eſcaping—everlaſting puniſhment will be your juſt doom; tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the moſt excruciating torments, will be your portion, without intermiſſion, without end. O that I could perſuade you to repent, and forſake your ſins, that ſo your iniquities may not be your ruin, and return to the Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who is exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour to give repentance and forgiveneſs of ſins.—This is a faithful ſaying and worthy of all acceptation, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> came into the world to ſave ſinners, the chief of ſinners; if they will but truly repent them of their former ſins, and ſtedfaſtly purpoſe, through the aſſiſtance of divine grace, to lead a new life, and have a lively faith in God's mercy through <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they ſhall be ſaved, ſaved from ſin, from its guilt and dominion, ſaved from death and hell, ſaved with an everlaſting ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>O SIRS, be not faithleſs, but believing; may it be given you to believe on the only begotten Son of God, and believing, may you have life through his name.—As to you, who have obtained that precious gift of faith, through the righteouſneſs of God and our Saviour <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> and have received thoſe exceeding great and precious promiſes, whereby you have been made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the divine nature, having eſcaped the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is in the world through luſt, give all diligence, and add to your faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to knowledge temperance, and to temperance pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and to patience godlineſs, and to godlineſs bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly kindneſs, and to brotherly kindneſs charity;—for, if theſe things be in you and abound, they will make you that ye ſhall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Likewiſe, give diligence to make your calling and election ſure; for, if you do theſe things, you ſhall never fall; and ſo
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012034_0019_0F8971B5740886B0"/>
an entrance ſhall be miniſtered unto you abundantly into the everlaſting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> By thus acting, you will evidently demonſtrate to the world that there is more in real religion than they are apt to imagine, and will clearly ſhew, in particular, that that grand and leading doctrine of juſtification by faith alone is not deſtructive of morality; but, that thoſe who are born again from above are alſo created a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> unto good works, which God before ordained that men ſhould walk in them, and though your whole dependance for juſtification in the ſight of God is by faith in the death and ſufferings, the life and obedience of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> yet you will be careful to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and practiſe <hi>all good works,</hi> every return and labour of love both to God and man, thereby juſtifying your faith, proving to the world, that it is true and genuine—hereby you will let your light ſhine before men, and they will ſee your good works and glorify your Father which is in Heaven: And by thus ordering your life and converſation aright, God will not only ſhew you, but make you happy partakers of his ſalvation.</p>

            <p>MONDAY laſt being the Anniverſary of laying the foundation of the Orphan-Houſe, the new and very decent Chapel lately erected there was opened.

we are now met to open and ſolemnly dedicate this new and convenient Chapel to the ſervice of our God and Saviour <hi>Jeſus Christ.</hi>—The many and great advantages accruing from the eſtabliſhment of publick ſchools in every government is obvious, and, in a young province as this is, it muſt be of the higheſt importance to its fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture proſperity and welfare, which is the profeſſed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of this charitable inſtitution; an inſtitution evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calculated to promote the happineſs of ſociety, by providing for, and inſtructing ſuch poor children, as would otherwiſe, in all appearance, be brought up in ignorance, and become of little uſe and value to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.—They are <hi>here</hi> early taught their duty to God, their Country, and the reſpect they owe to thoſe in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over them. God has various, and to us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought of ways, which we poor ſhort-ſighted beings cannot fathom, to effect his purpoſes; but I hope I may be allowed to ſay, that, in all human probability, great might have been the bleſſing to this noble undertaking, had it pleaſed divine providence to have prolonged the valuable life of the deceaſed Founder—but he is now no more.—We have, however, no doubt of the great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the fatherleſs ſupplying his loſs; and that your Excellency, and all well-diſpoſed perſons, eſpecially the good people of this province, will eſpouſe our cauſe, and promote our welfare.—Agreeable to the plan of our deceaſed Benefactor, an Academy is now <hi>begun</hi> to be ſuperadded to the Orphan-Houſe, and Gentlemen of this province will have an opportunity of educating their ſons under their immediate inſpection, and will not be under the neceſſity of ſending them at a great diſtance for that purpoſe, and be conſtantly labouring under the painful anxiety of knowing of their health and welfare, beſides being probably at a greater and more uncertain expence.</p>
                        <p>THE utility of this, it's humbly preſumed, wants no

recommendation; it is natural to love the place where we received our education, and paſſed our firſt years.—If parents would therefore have the pleaſure of ſeing the daily progreſs their children make in knowledge; if they deſire they ſhould love and revere them, and have a peculiar regard for the place of their nativity; if they would preſerve them from the improper liberties, they may take, when removed from their authority; it ſurely muſt be moſt eligible to let them ſpend their early years under the ſhadow of their wings, and within the reach of their parental admonitions.</p>

                        <p>HAVING obſerved the attention of your Excellency to the exerciſes of this morning, and the marks of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and approbation ſo viſible in all the Gentlemen and Ladies now preſent, I think it my duty, with the warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt gratitude, to acknowledge the honour your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and this reſpectable audience have conferred on this inſtitution.—The young Gentlemen that juſt now ſpoke before your Excellency have not been long under my tuition; they are <hi>indeed young</hi>—and ſcarce initiated in the firſt principles of Literature; however, I flatter myſelf that theſe feeble attempts will be favourably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and that hereafter they will be enabled to exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit ſomething more worthy of your attention and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.</p>
                        <p>IT affords me the higheſt ſatisfaction, when I reflect, that divine providence hath honoured me with the care and direction of them, and I cannot but make a tender of my ſincere and beſt reſpects to you, our worthy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor, and to their worthy parents and friends, for the great confidence repoſed in me.—Duly ſenſible of the important truſt committed to every preceptor, I ſhall, in the fear of God, do my utmoſt to form their tender minds, and to impreſs on them ſuch principles as may tend to advance their happineſs in private, as well as in publick life: And I hope, from their proficiency, the Gentlemen of this province will be induced to promote
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:012034_0027_0F8971BC36C49970"/>
with all their influence the growth and proſperity of our preſent undertaking.</p>
                        <p>THE ſtrict and virtuous education of youth is a point of great conſequence in every country, and thoſe that are employed therein do certainly merit the attention and encouragement of the publick in proportion to their faithfulneſs; for my part, I do moſt chearfully dedicate my whole time to this laborious work, and am deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to purſue it with the greateſt aſſiduity and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, being convinced that I can in no other way do more good to the true intereſt of my fellow beings, or do more ſervice to the province.</p>
                        <p>IT is undoubtedly the indiſpenſible obligation of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one entruſted with the buſineſs of education to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy the publick with reſpect to their abilities and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and therefore I hope to convince you that no pains will be ſpared, no time loſt, that whatever is uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the ſciences, or ornamental in life, will <hi>here</hi> be inculcated both by precept and example.—Authors in the ſeveral branches of knowledge will be regularly read, and the ſacred ſcriptures conſtantly explained:—Theſe can beſtow underſtanding upon all men; they are the univerſal logick, ſince none can read them without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acquiring a greater exactneſs of thought, or being invited to contract a greater rectitude of manners.</p>
                        <p>OUR time being ſo far elapſed, permit me, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of theſe poor Orphans, and in the name of every member concerned in this Seminary, moſt heartily to thank your Excellency, and all the Gentlemen and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies now before me, for their kind attendance on this ſolemnity.
