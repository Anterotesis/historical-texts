            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>THE chief occaſion of the enſuing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is this: About four years ago, on a view of the prevailing diſpoſition in multitudes, either to pry into futuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to the neglect of preſent duty, or to contend about religion, inſtead of regarding the life and practice of it, while the vanities of time carried the world before them, I was moved to publiſh a diſcourſe from <hi>James</hi> ii. 22. with this title, <hi>True Faith will produce good Works.</hi> And through the whole endeavoured to handle the glorious truths of the goſpel in a practical way; and had as little expectation of being publicly attacked therefor as for any thing I ever wrote: And I was not alone in this thought, for a worthy miniſter in <hi>Great-Britain</hi> ſays, in a letter, <q>Your ſermon on the Fruits of Faith is well adapted to ſilence gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers.</q> Yet how often are we diſappointed in this evil world!</p>

Mr. <hi>Daniel Martin,</hi> Elder of a Baptiſt Church in <hi>Rehoboth,</hi> publiſhed a piece laſt fall, intituled, <hi>Some Meditations on the plain Teſtimony of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, relating to the</hi> elect <hi>or</hi> choſen of God, &amp;c. wherein, after inſerting as a motto our Saviour's caution to take heed how and who we hear, he begins thus: <q>Having received the foregoing caution and inſtruction from the moſt wonderful Counſellor that ever ſpoke on earth. I have made the following obſervations on ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral points of doctrine delivered by Mr. <hi>Iſaac B—s,</hi> in his book intituled, <hi>True Faith will produce good Works,</hi> wherein he hath made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worthy obſervations, and given divers good inſtructions; but to my ſorrow he hath advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeveral points of doctrine, which appear to me to be in oppoſition to the ſenſe and pure meaning of the holy ſcriptures.</q> And he goes on to bend all his force through his whole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance againſt the peculiar doctrines of ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign grace.</p>
               <p>Several reaſons were ſuggeſted, in my own mind and by others, againſt making any reply to this piece at all: As that it is ſo plainly erroneous, that it was not likely to do much hurt; that there is no end of controverſy; and it is peculiarly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable for one Baptiſt to contend with another, who have ſo many others againſt them on every ſide. But in anſwer to this, it appears, that as plain as theſe errors are, yet many are carried away with them; and though contention is diſagreeable, yet if we can ſee the faith once delivered to the ſaints betrayed, and hold our peace, how ſhall we anſwer it to him who has required us to contend
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011971_0005_0F92A44270A96D90"/>
                  <hi>earneſtly</hi> therefor? And will not a juſt view of the laſt objection turn its weight the other way? For an engine which has been much uſed, both in the paſt and preſent age, to prejudice people againſt the Baptiſts, has been to repreſent them as unſound in goſpel doctrine; and now when an aged Elder of that denomination has repreſented to the world, that to hold, "That faith is not of man," carries in it that <q>He that is juſtified by faith, is juſtified becauſe God hath given it to him; and he that believeth not is damned, becauſe God hath not given him faith;</q> p. 15. if we let ſuch reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es againſt ſovereign grace paſs unanſwered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in our denomination, what a handle would others make of it, to repreſent us all either as corrupt in principle, or elſe more after party than truth? Nay, if thoſe who met their <hi>enemies</hi> ox or aſs going aſtray, and did not bring it back again, broke a command of God<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> xxiii. 4.</note>; how can we anſwer it to him, if we ſee our <hi>friends</hi> and fellow mortals going in a way that we are fully convinced leads to deſtruction, and not attempt, as we have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, to ſhew them their danger? <hi>Paul</hi>'s ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſire for the ſalvation of his brethren and kinsfolk, moved him to take pains to convince them, that, though they followed after the law of righteouſneſs, yet that they did quite miſs their way, becauſe they ſought it <hi>not by faith, but as it were by the deeds of the law. Rom.</hi> ix. 22. And as it appears to me that Mr. <hi>M—n</hi> has miſſed the right way in the ſame reſpect, I think it a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to attempt in a brief and plain manner to ſhew him wherein he has done ſo.</p>

The grand point which he objects againſt in my book, is the manner of my holding <hi>election:</hi> He profeſſeth to hold it; but thinks I hold it in a wrong way. I had obſerved from <hi>Eph.</hi> i. 3—7. that <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>He hath choſen us, that we ſhould be holy;</hi> but the modern notions are, that he chooſeth us becauſe we <hi>are holy,</hi> making that to be the <hi>cauſe,</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> viewed to be the <hi>effect:</hi> All the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy turns upon this point, whether the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God's will, or our free will, be the cauſe of our holineſs and happineſs. Mr. <hi>M—n</hi> mentions this, and anſwers, that <hi>both</hi> are the cauſe thereof, p. 6. To prove which, he cites many declarations of God's good will, and then ſays; <q>Since it is the good will of God that all men ſhould be ſaved and come to the knowledge of the truth, what doth hinder, or indeed what can hinder or prevent, but the want of man's good will?</q> p. 7. Ay ſure enough, what elſe can hinder? But ſince that is <hi>wanting,</hi> how can it be any cauſe of our ſalvation? <hi>Solomon</hi> fays, That which is <hi>wanting</hi> cannot be numbered: Yet behold! here is one wiſer than <hi>Solomon!</hi> For he can reckon that which is <hi>wanting</hi> for a principal part of the capital ſum! Perhaps it will be ſaid, if it is wanting in one, it may not in another. This I ſuppoſe is the thing aimed at, for he ſays, <q>By free will I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand good will; when a man's will is to do the will of God.</q> p. 7. And again, <q>We may aſſure ourſelves, that God hath not hid the light of the goſpel from any man or people, who deſire and ſeek after the knowledge of God.</q> p. 13. Who pretends that he does? I was ſo far from doing of it, that in anſwer to an
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:011971_0007_0F92A44406AC6B78"/>objection, p. 82. I. obſerved, that "We may be heartily willing to do many outward actions, which yet we cannot do, and ſo are excuſed from blame in our not doing them; but the cauſe why ſouls cannot believe the record which God has given of his Son, and love and obey him with all their hearts, is becauſe they <hi>love darkneſs rather than light;</hi> yea, <hi>hate the light,</hi> becauſe the <hi>carnal mind is enmity againſt God." John</hi> iii. 19, 20. <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 7. And if our advocate for free will and good works read this and much more to the ſame purpoſe in my book, before he wrote againſt it, where are his good works, while he miſrepreſents my ſentiments? And if he did not read it, where is his regard to equity, to condemn a man without a hearing?</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>M—n</hi> has told us, that by free will he underſtands a will to do the will of God; but he has not informed us who the people are, or where they live, that naturally have ſuch a will: He is not ſo fair in this reſpect, as <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> was about <hi>perfection;</hi> for though he laboured much to prove that ſuch a ſtate was attainable in this life, yet he ſays, <q>With reſpect to myſelf, I ſpeak mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly, becauſe I ingeniouſly confeſs that I have not yet attained it<note n="*" place="bottom">By the way I would here obſerve, that as in my late <hi>Plea for Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> I happened to mention it as a Quaker notion, that when a perſon has the ſpirit with him, he is then perſect; I would now retract that ſentence; for I am informed by a principal leader among them, that I miſtook their ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and I would always watch againſt miſrepreſenting any people, though I differ ever ſo much from them. He informs me that they hold ſanctification to be a progreſſive work, and that a perſon may be under powerful influences of the ſpirit, and yet have remaining corruptions, though they ſuppoſe that a perfect victory over them is attainable in this life. Now as I willingly retract my miſtake of their ſentiments, ſo I think it but a friendly part to let them know, that for friend <hi>Barclay,</hi> in p. 8. of his Apology, to repreſent that <q>Thoſe who plead for juſtification wholly by the imputation of a righteouſneſs without them, deny the neceſſity of being cloathed with an inward righteouſneſs,</q> is not juſt; for no men upon earth hold ſtronger to the neceſſity of regeneration and inward ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, than thoſe who truſt alone on Chriſt's imputed righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs for their juſtification before God.</note>.</q> So here I believe every
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011971_0008_0F92A446881B64C8"/>one of <hi>Adam</hi>'s children, who are brought to a true ſight of their caſe, will concur with the Apoſtle's confeſſion, that <hi>all</hi> have ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God; and that <hi>all</hi> go on, either ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly or openly, to ſerve divers luſts and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, till the kindneſs and love of God our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour appears, <hi>not by works of righteouſneſs which we have done, but according to his mercy,</hi> to ſave us, by the <hi>waſhing of regeneration, and renewing of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, Rom.</hi> iii. 23. <hi>Tit.</hi> iii. 3—5. Our author's notion that both God's will and ours are the cauſe of our ſalvation, runs him into the following ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities.</p>
               <p n="1">I. To exclude all thoſe divine teſtimonies which prove man's univerſal depravity: That both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> are <hi>all</hi> under ſin, and <hi>none</hi> righteous, no <hi>not one;</hi> are <hi>all</hi> gone out of the way, and <hi>none</hi> that doth good, no <hi>not one;</hi> that we are <hi>by nature</hi> children of wrath, <hi>even as others;</hi> that the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath included <hi>all</hi> under ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> iii. 9—19. <hi>Eph.</hi> ii. 3. <hi>Gal.</hi> iii. 22. I ſay his notion excludes all ſuch teſtimonies of truth, of which the bible is full, even ſo far, that though his book is filled with texts which he imagines will prove univerſal redemption, yet I think he never takes notice of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:011971_0009_0F92A44716330390"/>one that proves our univerſal depravity, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he talks ſo much of keeping cloſe to ſcripture.</p>
               <p n="2">II. As the nature of his ſcheme is the ſame of that which inſnared the <hi>Galatians,</hi> ſo it is attended with the ſame conſequence which the Apoſtle mentions to them: It would <hi>fruſtrate</hi> the grace of God, and make Chriſt to <hi>die in vain, Gal.</hi> ii. 21. For if men have a will to do the will of God, they had no need of a Saviour to die for them, and if they have it not, they are like to periſh, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what he has done; for Mr. <hi>M—n</hi> ſays, <q>It ſeems by our Lord's parable, <hi>Luke</hi> xiv. 16—20. that there was nothing wanting on the part of him that made the ſupper, but on the part of them that were bidden; their good will was lacking; their will and affections were on earthly things.</q> p. 7. Therefore by his ſcheme, unleſs our Lord could find ſome of the children of men who had not their will and affections on earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, his great ſupper will be loſt: Nay it muſt unavoidably be ſo; for if any could be found with ſuch a good will as our author deſcribes, the Saviour could have no right to call them to this ſupper, becauſe he came not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance, <hi>Luke</hi> v. 32. That turn which way you will, this notion of free will <hi>fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates</hi> the grace of God, and would make Chriſt to <hi>die in vain.</hi> Mr. <hi>M—n</hi> ſays, <q>They did not improve the power he had given them.</q> I know they did not improve it right, for they improved it to excuſe themſelves from coming, and to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue their own ways. Again he aſſerts, that <q>Faith is a work which God requireth of man, and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011971_0010_0F92A447B0C64460"/>what our Lord taught the people to labour in.</q> p. 14. And to prove it refers us to <hi>John</hi> vi. 27—29. Though in this he diſcovers a darker notion about faith than the <hi>Jews</hi> did, for it appears that they knew that faith is giving credit to another, and not a work of our own; therefore in the next words they aſk for a ſign, that they might ſee and believe, and they plainly intimate, that though he had fed five thouſand, yet <hi>Moſes</hi> had done much more, even fed ſix hundred thouſand of their fathers in the wilderneſs, ſo that they were not inclined to leave <hi>Moſes</hi> for <hi>Jeſus;</hi> and though he aſſured them that it was not <hi>Moſes</hi> who gave that bread, and that the Father had now given the true bread from heaven, yet their diſpoſition and conduct diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed plainly, that it muſt be the <hi>work of God</hi> to make any of them believe it. Mr. <hi>M—n</hi> is ſo far from allowing this point, that he ventures to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that <q>The unbeliever is not made a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever by the mighty power of God working in him, but by hearing and receiving the word.</q> p. 30. And ſo becauſe the word is the inſtrument of faith, he denies that God by his power is the <hi>author</hi> of it; and holds it to be "of man." p. 14. Hence,</p>
               <p n="3">III. His plan would make the will of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator <hi>dependent</hi> on the will of the creature; for he labours much to prove that full proviſion is made for the ſalvation of all men, while he owns that many miſs of it, becauſe their good will is wanting, yet denies the exertion of divine power to work faith in any; the certain conſequence of which is, that it <hi>depends</hi> upon man's will whether God ſhall ever have his good will in the ſalvation of one ſoul
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:011971_0011_0F92A44897F71220"/>or not! This conſequence is ſo unanſwerable, that it ſeems our author dare not meddle with it; for I had mentioned it in a quotation from one of our Baptiſt Elders in <hi>Carolina,</hi> at the foot of my 56th page; yet though he quotes a paſſage out of the middle of that page, he never ſays a word upon this glaring abſurdity which attends his doctrine. For the reader's ſatisfaction, I will give him the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. It is this: <q>
                     <hi>Conditional election</hi> ſets up an <hi>inferior</hi> cauſe above a <hi>ſuperior;</hi> making election and ſalvation no more than a <hi>may be,</hi> inſtead of a <hi>ſhall be.</hi> It repreſents the Almighty as ever fluctuating in his councils, taking up with new conſultations <hi>dependent</hi> on the fickle will of man, and the uncertain acts that flow therefrom; by which method he is brought in ſaying, O! I will if they will, and O! that they may will to believe, become holy, diligently and perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly improving their ſtock of free will abilities, that they may be ſaved; nevertheleſs NOT MY WILL, but THEIR WILL be done<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Iſaac Chanler</hi>'s Doctrines of Grace, printed at <hi>Boſton,</hi> 1744, p. 208.</note>!</q> Now ſince this lay directly in Mr. <hi>M—n</hi>'s way, what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can be given for his avoiding any mention of it, but becauſe he could not anſwer it? I confeſs it is beyond my weak capacity to conceive how it can be fairly anſwered, and if others can, it would certainly be much more to the purpoſe to do it, than what they on that ſide generally dwell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The ſum of all our author's meditations is, he imagines that to hold the good pleaſure of God's will to be the ſole cauſe of our ſalvation, and that faith is his gift, and wrought in the ſoul
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011971_0012_0F92A44C1C8A0F90"/>by his power, would carry this dreadful conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in it, <q>That men cannot be judged and rewarded according to their works, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as he hath given, or neglected to give.</q> And he ſeems as much affrighted at this imagination as ever a timorous perſon was at a black ſtump in the night: He has it over and over from one end of his pamphlet to the other, and upon every mention of it, he turns away to a number of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which prove that God is both juſt and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, which we hold as fully as he does; alſo upon every view of my pleas for God's ſovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and power, that frightful image riſes in view, again, which makes ſuch powerful impreſſions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, that he ſeems not to know ſcripture when he runs againſt it. For inſtance, I had obſerved, p. 33. that ſaving faith is a receiving with all the heart the witneſs and teſtimony that God has giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en of eternal life in his Son, and he who believeth not hath made him a liar. Iſt <hi>John,</hi> v. 9—12. the evidence of which truth ſhines ſo clear as to leave all without excuſe, who do not believe with all their hearts; while every ſoul that is made willing by divine power to receive his teſtimony, and ſet to his ſeal that God is true, knows that this <hi>faith is not of himſelf,</hi> it is the <hi>gift of God.</hi> I thus marked theſe laſt words as ſcripture, and in the margin referred to the text, <hi>Eph.</hi> ii. 8. yet Mr. <hi>M—n,</hi> after citing this paſſage, ſays, <q>Is it right to ſay, becauſe faith is the gift of God, that therefore it is not of man?</q> And after bringing many texts to try to prove that this is not true, he ſays, <q>Now let us conſider a little of the conſequence of this <hi>vain notion,</hi> that faith is <hi>not
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:011971_0013_0F92A44C697A5CC8"/>of man.</hi>
                  </q> P. 14, 15. And ſo recurs to his frightful imagination again, without being ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that he is not here contending with <hi>I. B.</hi> but with divine revelation. And I muſt confeſs that thoſe who hold to his doctrine of free will, would be more conſiſtent to own themſelves <hi>Deiſts,</hi> than to act as they now do; for Dr. <hi>Young,</hi> the moſt open Deiſt that I have heard of in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, publiſhed a piece in his own defence, in the <hi>Boſton Evening-Poſt,</hi> the 27th of laſt <hi>Auguſt,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he declares, he has as great a veneration for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny glorious things in the old and new-teſtament as any Chriſtian in this country; but ſays, there are ſome things in the ſcriptures that he does not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand. And what are they? Why ſays he, <q>Such as how God can be ſaid to predeſtinate one to everlaſting life, and leave another to inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and eternal perdition, and yet <hi>of a truth,</hi> be no reſpecter of perſons.</q> This he thinks to be inconſiſtent, and therefore rejects thoſe parts of ſcripture that teach it: Mr. <hi>M—n</hi> profeſſes to hold all the ſcripture, and yet the center of all his difficulty with me, is exactly the ſame that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt has againſt the bible, becauſe it teaches that doctrine. And the bottom of the matter with both is, becauſe they think they <hi>deſerve</hi> ſomething bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than to be left to periſh in their ſins: For if that were not the caſe, any perſon of common ſenſe can eaſily ſee the right the <hi>houſholder</hi> had to <hi>give</hi> to ſome what they did not deſerve, while he did not fail to let every one have their due, and can ſee the iniquity of thoſe who <hi>murmured</hi> at the <hi>good man</hi> for ſo doing. Yea vulgar underſtandings can eaſily comprehend the juſtice of that ſtriking
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:011971_0014_0F92A44CF08F80D8"/>demand, <hi>Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil becauſe I am good?</hi> Our Lord tells us that the kingdom of heaven is <hi>like</hi> this. <hi>Matt.</hi> xx. 1—15. Therefore,</p>
               <p n="4">IV. This ſcheme would rob God of his eſſential <hi>glory.</hi> I had obſerved, that the reſpect of perſons which is condemned in ſcripture, is a <hi>perverting of juſtice,</hi> and every pious ſoul deteſts ſuch a thought concerning the Deity; yet we have early notice of his reſpecting perſons in another ſenſe, for he had <hi>reſpect</hi> to <hi>Abel</hi> and to his offering; but unto <hi>Cain</hi> and to his offering he had not <hi>reſpect;</hi> which made <hi>Cain very wroth.</hi> And I obſerved that God's demand on him upon that occaſion was as much as if he had ſaid, 'Do you think I am ſo unjuſt, as not to accept all that is well done?' Mr. <hi>M—n</hi> takes notice, that I acknowledge that well-doing is accepted, and yet, as if I had diſowned it, he goes on and brings many texts which prove that ſaints will be rewarded in the great day, and then ſays <q>I think it is plain, that for any to hold that God, without any juſt cauſe ariſing from what he foreſaw in one man more than another, hath choſen or elected a particular number to ſalvation, and left all the reſt to periſh in their ſins, is unjuſt and unequal.</q> p. 5, 6. This is the man who has often cautioned his readers againſt the <hi>ſlight</hi> of men, and <hi>craſt</hi> of deceivers; but what ſhall we call his conduct here? He heaps up texts, that the reader may think he has proved his point well, and of courſe that his antagoniſt is very erroneous; but what has he proved? Why he has proved that ſaints will be rewarded, and who denied it? He knows I did
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:011971_0015_0F92A44D9E0A1FE0"/>not, yet he will have it that there was ſomething foreſeen in them better than others, which was the cauſe of their being choſen and ſaved: It is in plain terms as much as to ſay, <q>It is unjuſt and unequal for God to <hi>give</hi> ſalvation to ſome ſinners, and leave the reſt to periſh, unleſs he ſaw that ſome <hi>deſerved</hi> ſalvation more than others;</q> which would make election and ſalvation to be of <hi>debt,</hi> and not of <hi>grace,</hi> contrary to the whole bible.</p>
               <p>For this writer to hold, that becauſe God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the <hi>righteous,</hi> that therefore it would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coual for him to chooſe ſome <hi>ſinners</hi> to life, without ſeeing any good in them more than others, while he left the reſt to periſh, is as unreaſonable as it would be to argue, that a Nobleman could not juſtly beſtow a <hi>free favour</hi> upon any undeſerving object, becauſe he muſt <hi>pay</hi> his workmen their due; or to ſay, becauſe the King muſt execute <hi>juſtice,</hi> that therefore he has no right to ſhew <hi>mercy!</hi> And to repreſent, that holding ſaving faith to be not of ourſelves, but the gift of God, implies, that he muſt <q>Judge and condemn ſome poor ſinful men to eternal deſtruction for his own neglect,</q> P. 15. is as falſe as to ſay, becauſe the King pardons ſome criminals, therefore the reſt are executed for his neglect! when in truth the latter are executed for their crimes, while the others are ſaved by the King's mercy; a juſt view whereof will move them to love and obey him all their days; to illuſtrate which was the main deſign of my book, yet our advocate for juſtice and equity has picked out a few ſentences, without regarding the connexion of the diſcourſe, and exerted all his wit to cloath my doctrine with the blaſphemous garb mentioned
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:011971_0016_0F92A44EB858AEC0"/>above! If ſuch treatment of our Creator and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-creatures, is the natural effect of this notion of free will inſtead of free grace, what cauſe have we to abhor, and bear teſtimony againſt it!</p>
               <p>I had remarked, that Jeſus was ſo far from giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foreſeen faith and good works as the cauſe of babes receiving goſpel grace, inſtead of the wiſe and prudent, that he reſolves it into the Father's pleaſure alone, <hi>for ſo it ſeemed good in thy ſight, Matt.</hi> xi. 26. Mr. <hi>M—n</hi> cites this paſſage, p. 9. and then fills up four pages with ſcriptures and reaſonings, to prove that grace is proclaimed to all, and that thoſe who periſh will be juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and reckons it ſtrange that I or any man ſhould think, <q>That God did not foreſee that when this grace appeared to all men, ſome would believe and obey; or if it be concluded that he did, that he ſhould have no regard thereunto in his choice.</q> But what a ſlight of man is here? I aſſerted the two firſt of theſe points as plainly as he has, and hold them as fully, yet by this method he inſinuates the contrary. I alſo hold as ſtrongly as he can, that God foreſaw that a number would believe and obey; but the grand point between us is, how they come to do it? He ſays, mens living in ſin and not turning to the Lord, is the cauſe of their deſtruction, and if men turn they ſhall live, p. 11. I ſay the ſame with all my heart; but ſtill the queſtion between us is not anſwered, which is, how they came to turn? How unfair is it in diſputing for the opponent to deny a propoſition, and then run round and prove ſeveral other things, which the reſpondent holds as much as he does, and then boaſt of gaining the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011971_0017_0F92A44F410B9018"/>without ever touching the point in debate? I had proved that Jeſus reſolved the cauſe of babes receiving the goſpel, into the Father's pleaſure alone: My opponent denies it, and then brings many proofs that the wicked's deſtruction will be juſt, and that thoſe who turn ſhall live, without the leaſt evidence that any of <hi>Adam</hi>'s race have any free will power to turn themſelves, or that God had any regard to ſuch a power in chooſing one rather than another, which is the very matter in diſpute. I dare ſay, if Mr. <hi>M—n</hi> ſhould aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, that none but believers are the proper ſubjects of baptiſm under the goſpel, and one ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it, and then produce many proofs that children were circumciſed under the law, which he knows as well as they, he would hardly allow that he was fairly confuted; yet that would be full as fair as his treatment of me here.</p>
               <p>And what ſhall we ſay, if to unfairneſs men border hard upon untruths? He ſays, <q>To prove this ſcheme, Mr. <hi>B—s</hi> hath brought out of the whole bible <hi>one</hi> text, which is <hi>Matt.</hi> xi. 26.</q> p. 12. as if that one text was all I had produced to prove that grace is beſtowed in a way of entire ſovereignty; when in the very page before, I brought <hi>Luke</hi> iv. 15—29. where it appears that the inhabitants of <hi>Nazareth</hi> attended with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to what Jeſus preached concerning <hi>grace,</hi> as long as they imagined that they had a better claim thereto than others; but when he let them know, from the inſtance of favour ſhewn to a widow among the <hi>Sidonians,</hi> and to a leper among the <hi>Syrians,</hi> which was not ſhown to any in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that he had a good right to give ſalvation to the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:011971_0018_0F92A453F35F5248"/>
                  <hi>heathen,</hi> and leave them to periſh in their ſins;— then thoſe who wondered at his <hi>gracious words</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, were <hi>filled with wrath,</hi> and roſe up and THRUST him out. I ſay I had quoted this ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the foregoing page, with a larger comment upon it than I have given now, to prove the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute ſovereignty of grace; yet Mr. <hi>M—n</hi> ſkips over it without any notice, and would have the reader believe that I could bring but one text to favour my plan in all the bible.</p>
               <p>Sovereignty God claims as his peculiar glory, therefore in anſwer to the earneſt requeſt of <hi>Moſes</hi> for a ſight of his <hi>glory,</hi> he ſays, <hi>I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will ſhew mercy to whom I will ſhew mercy, Exod.</hi> xxxiii. 19. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> cites this paſſage, and then concludes thus upon it: <hi>So then it is</hi> NOT OF <hi>him that willeth,</hi> NOR OF <hi>him that runneth, but</hi> OF GOD <hi>that ſheweth mercy, Rom.</hi> ix. 16. But our late reaſoner ſays, <q>Moſt certainly BOTH the good will of God and the <hi>free will of man</hi> is the <hi>cauſe</hi> of their holineſs and happineſs,</q> p. 6. I leave it to the reader's conſideration, which of them is to be credited, and proceed to obſerve, that as this ſcheme would rob God of his glory, ſo,</p>
               <p n="5">V. It would <hi>cheat men of their ſouls,</hi> by flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them along in falſe hopes till they ſink in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair. I know my opponent calls it a <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging</hi> ſcheme to hold that God hath choſen on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a particular number to ſalvation, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard to their faith and obedience, p. 12. But let the matter be well examined: We both profeſs that full proviſion is made in the goſpel for the ſalvation of ſinners, and I believe that God
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:011971_0019_0F92A455AF46EBA8"/>will <hi>make his people willing</hi> in the day of <hi>his power,</hi> to ſerve him in the <hi>beauty of holineſs;</hi> that all who are given by the Father to the Son, <hi>ſhall come to him;</hi> and that <hi>no man can come except the Father draw him,</hi> which drawing is by the <hi>teaching</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty influence of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> cx. 3. <hi>John</hi> vi. 37, 44, 45, 63. and xvi. 8. But Mr. <hi>M—n</hi> holds, that though God's good will has made proviſion for us, yet that it muſt be <hi>of our</hi> free will, <hi>of our</hi> good will, if we ever come to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of it, p. 6, 7. Therefore as long as ſouls conceit they have or can work up ſuch a good will, they go on with ſelf-righteous hopes; but when they find that they have not ſuch a free will power, and cannot work it up, they muſt ſink in deſpair, notwithſtanding the help this ſcheme can afford them. He calls it a <hi>bold aſſertion</hi> for me to ſay, faith is wrought in the ſoul by the exceeding greatneſs of divine power; and ſays, for this I quote but one text, viz. <hi>Eph.</hi> i. 19. p. 27. which is not true, for in the ſame ſentence (p. 31 of my book) I quote another which calls Jeſus the <hi>author</hi> and <hi>finiſher of faith, Heb.</hi> xii. 2. And though he imagines that the power ſpoken of in <hi>Eph.</hi> i. 19. is only what is exerted to aſſiſt the believer in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wonders, and not a <q>Power which none can hinder, working ſaith in them who have not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved," p. 27, and preſumes to ſay, "The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer is not made a believer by the mighty power of God working in him,</q> p. 30. Yet alas! what an awful caſe ſhould we be in, if this was all the hope that the goſpel gave! The <hi>letter killeth,</hi> but the <hi>ſpirit giveth life.</hi> The <hi>vail</hi> will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main upon our hearts, till the ſpirit of the Lord
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:011971_0020_0F92A4560F371888"/>takes it away, and gives us with open face to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the divine glory, by which we are <hi>changed</hi> into the ſame image, 2d <hi>Cor.</hi> iii. 6—18. And ſince Mr. <hi>M—n</hi> denies that the power ſpoken of in <hi>Eph.</hi> i. 19. which raiſed Chriſt from the dead, is the power that firſt makes a ſinner a believer, I would deſire him to read on to the next chapter, where truth ſays, <hi>When we were dead in ſins God bath quickened us together with Chriſt:—By grace are ye ſaved, through faith; and that</hi> NOT OF <hi>yourſelves: It is the gift of God; not of works, leſt any man ſhould boaſt, for we are his workmanſhip,</hi> CREATED <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works.</hi> And if he will dare to ſay, that <hi>creating</hi> power, and the power that <hi>quickens the dead,</hi> is not the power that <q>none can hinder,</q> I ſhall not think it worth while for any man to reaſon farther with him; but hoping that he will not reſiſt the light to ſuch a degree, I would requeſt him to review the abſurdity of his notion, that a greater power is diſplayed to aſſiſt the believer than to convert a ſinner; that is, that a greater power is exerted to help Chriſt's friends, than to conquer his enemies! read <hi>Pſal.</hi> xlv. 1—7. compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> i. 8, 9.</p>
               <p>Thus I have ſhewn, that the notion of perſons being elected becauſe of their foreſeen faith and obedience, and that God has made full proviſion for all, yet does not exert his power to bring any to embrace it, but leaves that to the creatures will, excludes all the abundant teſtimony that truth has given to man's univerſal depravity, would fruſtrate the grace of God, and make Chriſt to die in vain; would make the will of the Creator dependent on that of the creature, and rob God of his eſſential
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:011971_0021_0F92A456C2CF3148"/>glory, while it would embolden worms to glory in his preſence, that they were better than others, till they ſink in diſcouragement and deſpair, by finding their imaginary excellency and power fail them. But on the other hand, that to hold forth the free proclamation of the goſpel to the <hi>chief of ſinners,</hi> and that Chriſt died for the <hi>ungodly,</hi> and has given the ſpirit to convince and change their ſouls, working in them all the good pleaſure of his goodneſs, and the <hi>work of faith with power,</hi> 2d <hi>Theſ.</hi> i. 11. This opens a glorious door of hope to guilty ſinners, and gives courage to the believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ſtrive according to his working, who worketh in him mightily, <hi>Col.</hi> i. 29.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>M—n,</hi> in order to make out that though faith is the gift of God, yet that it is <hi>of man,</hi> ſays, <q>Our temporal food and raiment are the gifts of God, are they therefore not of men? Hath not God ordained that man ſhould get bread by the ſweat of his face? <hi>Gen.</hi> iii. 19—23. And when he fed his people <hi>Iſrael</hi> with bread from heaven, and quails in the wilderneſs, they had it together, and dreſt, and did not eat thereof without their labour; ſo then faith being the gift of God, doth not hinder its being the work and labour of men,</q> p. 14. Upon which I would remark,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That here is no diſtinction made betwixt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and ſpiritual actions, between which there is as great a difference as there is between ſoul and body. We all grant that men have a natural power to do rational actions, but the queſtion is, whether any have ability to perform any ſpiritual or holy action, before they are regenerated by the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:011971_0022_0F92A4577A9D62E8"/>holy ſpirit or not?—2. It is the divine appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that our temporal food and raiment ſhould be raiſed out of the earth by our labour, but to hold ſalvation upon ſuch a footing, would make it of <hi>works</hi> and not of <hi>grace,</hi> contrary to the whole goſpel.—3. We allow that the manna that was rained round the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> tents, was a type of the heavenly food which is brought near to our ſouls in the goſpel, and as they were to receive and eat of it freely, ſo the goſpel calls us to a feaſt where <hi>all things are now ready;</hi> but how ridiculous would a meſſenger appear, that ſhould come and call the poor and needy to a <hi>free</hi> entertainment, upon condition they will firſt <hi>work hard for it!</hi> None ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that perſons will enjoy the benefit of food, though ever ſo choice and free, if they do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it; but who ever thought that eating food was working for it, or performing a condition to obtain it? However, as coming and eating imply local motion and bodily exerciſe, we are in danger of having our minds ſomewhat darkened by this ſimilitude, if we do not correct it by others; therefore our Lord, in his diſcourſe to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> compares believing to <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s looking to the brazen ſerpent, which was not a local motion nor long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe; but as quick as ſight; neither had they any thing to recommend them, for they were poiſoned in a deadly manner, and that as the fruit of their ſin; but they were called to look off from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the remedy which God had freely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and as many as did ſo received immediate healing. So do all thoſe who behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the ſin of the world. The very notion of faith carries us off from ourſelves,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:011971_0023_0F92A458330D5DD0"/>for it is admitting the teſtimony of another, and not any work of ours; our character has no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern in the affair, as whether we are poor or rich, worthy or unworthy, for it depends entirely upon the evidence that we have of the credibility of the ſpeaker: And though we often ſtrive againſt, or try to avoid the light, becauſe our deeds are evil, yet when our ſouls are brought to receive divine truth, it is no more of our work than it is to ſee and enjoy the light when the ſun ſhines, <hi>Pſal.</hi> lxxxiv. 11. <hi>John</hi> iii. 14—20.—4. The light directs our way, and we are influenced by the objects which we view, to avoid what appears odious or dangerous, and to purſue what we think is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with all our might. So by faith the ſoul flies to Chriſt to ſupply all its wants, and cleaves to him in the way of holineſs, and is moved to watch againſt all iniquity, and to crucify the fleſh, with its affections and luſts: This was the whole tenor of my book, which therefore I intituled, <hi>True Faith will produce good Works;</hi> but this title Mr. <hi>M—n</hi> denies, and attempts to prove the contrary, though before he proceeds to any proof, he again brings up his frightful imagination, if poſſible to prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the reader's mind. But hoping that the reader will not be guilty of the folly of judging a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before he hears it, I would deſire him to take notice what it is that is now to be proved. It is, that "<hi>True faith</hi> doth ſometimes fail of produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good works," p. 25. <hi>True faith,</hi> which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to be <q>A receiving with <hi>all the heart</hi> the witneſs and teſtimony that God hath given us.</q> Faith, by which the ſoul views <q>The <hi>precept</hi> to be true and excellent, therefore to be
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:011971_0024_0F92A458EF6A8108"/>obeyed; the <hi>promiſe</hi> to be ſure and ſufficient, therefore he ſhall be ſupported, and preſents eternal things as <hi>near</hi> and <hi>real,</hi> therefore to be regarded without delay,</q> p. 33, 35. of my book. This is the conſtant idea that I gave of true faith; yet the firſt text that my opponent brings to prove that it ſometimes fails of producing good works, is <hi>John</hi> xii. 42, 43. which inform us of ſome rulers who believed on Jeſus, but did not confeſs him, becauſe they loved the praiſe of men more than the praiſe of God. His ſecond is <hi>John</hi> viii. 30—32. where we find ſome <hi>Jews</hi> who had a ſort of belief on <hi>Jeſus,</hi> but he ſignified to them that a <hi>continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> in his word would diſcover whether they were his <hi>diſciples indeed</hi> or not; and that diſcovery was ſoon made, for his only telling of them that they ſhould <hi>know the truth,</hi> and the <hi>truth ſhould make them free,</hi> raiſed their reſentment. Now if men can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the goſpel with <hi>all their hearts,</hi> and yet love the praiſe of men more than the praiſe of God, if they can be <hi>true believers,</hi> and yet not <hi>know the truth,</hi> nor be <hi>made free</hi> by it, then he has proved his point; if not, he has done nothing towards it.</p>
               <p>To introduce his next proof he tells us, that love is a labour, and we may be ſure that it is a work which God will not forget, <hi>Heb.</hi> vi. 10. and then turns us to 1ſt <hi>Cor.</hi> xiii. 2. in order to prove that true faith may be without love, p. 26. But it is pity the man had not read on to the next verſe, which contains as much of a proof that giving <hi>all our goods to feed the poor</hi> may be without <hi>love,</hi> as the other does that a faith of miracles may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; and both prove that all external works or gifts will not avail us, without they are done from
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:011971_0025_0F92A459B2E82290"/>right principles; but how does that prove that true faith will not produce love and good works? In the laſt verſe of that chapter the Apoſtle ſets faith before charity, and in <hi>Gal.</hi> v. 6. he ſays, <hi>Faith works by love,</hi> and I wonder how Mr. <hi>M—n</hi> thinks any can love and ſerve God here but only by faith, ſince thoſe objects are inviſible to ſenſe. <hi>Peter</hi> ſhews, that the way in which ſaints <hi>love</hi> and <hi>rejoice</hi> in an <hi>unſeen</hi> Chriſt, is by <hi>believing,</hi> 1ſt <hi>Pet.</hi> i. 8. and <hi>Paul</hi> ſhews <hi>faith unfeigned,</hi> as well as charity, to be ſo eſſential to true obedience, that all teaching that <hi>ſwerves</hi> therefrom he calls <hi>vain jangling,</hi> 1ſt <hi>Tim.</hi> i. 5—7. and I leave others to judge, who are now guilty of ſuch ignorant jangling.</p>
               <p>To finiſh his proofs, our author turns us to the many nominal believers in our land, whoſe faith does not produce good works; to which he might have ſeen an anſwer in my 57th page, where I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> compares ſuch a faith to a <hi>dead body;</hi> but who would reject all bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, becauſe there are ſome dead ſtinking ones? We read of the <hi>ſpirit of faith,</hi> and of <hi>living by faith;</hi> and thoſe pretenders to faith and grace who do not live ſo, <hi>Jude</hi> calls them <hi>filthy dreamers;</hi> but who will argue that our waking views do not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern our conduct, becauſe <hi>dreams</hi> do not common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bring men off from their ſluggiſh beds! <hi>Paul</hi> ſays to ſome bad profeſſors among the Chriſtians, <hi>Awake</hi> to righteouſneſs and ſin not; for ſome have not the knowledge of God: I ſpeak this to your ſhame! It is a ſhame to any church to ſuffer ſuch members among them, 1ſt <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 34. Again, to the ſaints at <hi>Rome</hi> he ſays, It is high time to <hi>awake out of ſleep;</hi> and whenever they are awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:011971_0026_0F92A45A84D42908"/>to the exerciſe of true faith, it will as certainly produce good works in every ſoul, as it moved <hi>Abraham</hi> to give up his darling at the divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, or <hi>Moſes</hi> to count reproaches for Chriſt, greater riches than all the treaſures in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and enabled him to endure, as ſeeing him that is inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>Before Mr. <hi>M—n</hi> began his remarks upon my piece, he entered a caution againſt being deceived by the power or tradition, p. 4. but he is not the firſt man who has been inſnared in the very thing he caution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed others againſt. Tradition has taught him to hold the ſix principles in <hi>Heb.</hi> vi. 1. as a ſummary of Chriſtian doctrine and practice, inſtead of viewing them as ſo many articles of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> creed; and this has not a little influence in leading him into miſtakes about faith; for though he allows that faith ſometimes comprehends the whole counſel of God, yet he ſays, <q>Faith ſometimes comprehends only one of the principles of the doctrine of Chriſt, as in <hi>Heb.</hi> vi. 1.</q> And after ſaying much upon it, he declares, that <q>God hath not promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed eternal life upon that ſingle grace of faith, as it is the belief of the truth, and one of the principles of the doctrine of Chriſt,</q> p. 18, 19. as if faith was but the ſixth part of religion; which is ſo far from truth, that the ſacred writer goes on, in the eleventh chapter of this ſame epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, to ſhew that all the good which was ever done by ancient ſaints, was done <hi>by faith.</hi> One of thoſe principles, viz. <hi>laying on of hands,</hi> has cauſed a great deal of controverſy, both formerly and lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly; and we are informed by one who was no ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the practice, that it came among the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:011971_0027_0F92A45B39E64400"/>from the <q>Eſtabliſhed church, who uſe it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of <hi>confirmation</hi>

                  </q> I do not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this, as though I thought their holding it as a tradition, or the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> holding it as one of the <hi>ſeven ſacraments,</hi> was a ſufficient evidence againſt the practice, but only to put each one upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, whether they ſtand upon any thing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than tradition or not; neither ſhall I meddle here with that controverſy, farther than it concerns this text, for many things may be contained elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, which are not in ſuch a particular text; though ſince ſuch great miſtakes concerning faith and ſalvation are drawn from this, I think it is a loud call to examine, whether we have not miſtaken its true meaning. The general rule given us to go by, is to compare ſpiritual things with ſpiritual. Now an evident deſign of the epiſtle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> was to explain to them the types of the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial law, and ſhew their <hi>perfect</hi> fulfilment in Jeſus Chriſt; but the ſacred writer complains in the fifth chapter, that they were dull of hearing, and were like <hi>babes</hi> that had need of one to teach them <hi>again,</hi> which were the <hi>firſt principles</hi> of the oracles of God; and having obſerved that thoſe who are of full age, have their ſenſes exerciſed to diſcern both good and evil, he begins the ſixth chapter with calling them to <hi>leave</hi> the principles of the doctrine of Chriſt, and go on to <hi>perfection.</hi> Dr. <hi>Gill</hi> on the place ſays, the word tranſlated <hi>firſt principles,</hi> is the ſame word that in <hi>Gal.</hi> iv. 3, 9. is rendered <hi>elements,</hi> by which it is very evident that the ceremonies of the law are intended; and
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:011971_0028_0F92A45C0B22AD70"/>both there and here, Chriſtians are reproved for their <hi>childiſh</hi> fondneſs for them.</p>
               <p>Letters are the elements, or firſt principles of learning, which we teach children; but we expect them afterwards to <hi>leave</hi> their ſpelling, and go on to a more <hi>perfect</hi> manner of reading: So the firſt principles of the doctrine of Chriſt were taught by the <hi>letters</hi> of that law, which are all now clearly to be read in him who is the glorious WORD. Under the law they were to ſpell out the doctrine of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance from dead works,</hi> by ſlain beaſts, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing their ſins over them; of <hi>faith towards God,</hi> as the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in covenant with them; of cleanſing from pollution, by the divers <hi>baptiſms</hi> or <hi>bathings,</hi> which were commanded; of the laying our ſins upon Jeſus, by the <hi>laying on of hands</hi> on the ſacrifice, which was enjoined not leſs than a dozen times in <hi>Leveticus;</hi> the <hi>reſurrection from the dead</hi> was ſhadowed out by the two goats for a ſin-offering, one of which was to die, and the other be let go alive; ſome intimations alſo were then given of <hi>eternal judgment,</hi> but ſince the new-teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has taught us <hi>repentance,</hi> by looking on him whom we have pierced, to <hi>believe</hi> on the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt for ſalvation, who ſaves by the <hi>waſhing</hi> of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt; has taught us that our ſins were <hi>laid</hi> on Chriſt, who bore them in his own body on the tree, died for our offences, and <hi>roſe again</hi> for our juſtification, and will come again to <hi>judge</hi> the world in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Since theſe things are clearly opened in the goſpel, ſhall we ſtill be fond of the elements of the law? No, let us <hi>leave</hi> them, and go on to <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;</hi> with which compare chap. ix. 9—12.
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:011971_0029_0F92A45CA3BC1628"/>which ſhew that the ſervice of the tabernacle was a <hi>figure</hi> for the time then preſent, in which were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered both gifts and ſacrifices, that could not make him that did the ſervice <hi>perfect,</hi> as pertaining to the conſcience, which ſtood only in meats and drinks, and divers <hi>waſhings,</hi> and carnal ordinances, impoſed on them until the time of reformation; but Chriſt being come an high prieſt of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, &amp;c. the words <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>perfection</hi> appear conſtantly to be uſed in this epiſtle, to diſtinguiſh the <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> bleſſings of the goſpel from the <hi>ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows</hi> of the law, as in chap. vii. 11, 19. and x. 1, 14. I find alſo, that the word in chap. ix. 10. which is rendered <hi>waſhings,</hi> is <hi>baptiſms</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">See Dr. <hi>Gill,</hi> and other expoſitors on the place. Mr. <hi>Purver,</hi> in his late tranſlation of the bible, tranſlates the word <hi>baptiſms</hi> here as he does in the ſixth chapter.</note>, in the plural number, as it is here in the ſixth chapter; but the ſingular, <hi>baptiſm,</hi> is uſed about twenty times for an ordinance of the goſpel, and never once in the plural, as I can find, in all the new-teſtament; which is a further evidence, that theſe ſix principles are not a ſummary of the goſpel, but of the ceremonies of the law: And if it is not ſo, how can we account for it, that repentance and faith ſhould be named, and not hope and love? Or that baptiſm ſhould be expreſſed, and not a word of the Lord's ſupper, which is equally an ordinance of the goſpel?</p>
               <p>If then repentance and faith are held in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of <hi>Moſes,</hi> rather than <hi>Paul,</hi> no wonder if the <hi>vail</hi> remains upon ſuch hearts, ſo that they cannot with open face behold the glories of divine grace
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:011971_0030_0F92A45FE92E82D0"/>in Jeſus Chriſt; and is not this the cauſe of our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's ſaying, <q>Shall we live by faith without works, or ſhall we build our hope upon faith and obedience, and not on faith only?</q> p. 20. Anſwer, he that builds his hope either upon faith or obedience, or upon both together, conſidered as our acts, builds upon the ſand; for <hi>other foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> and if we are enabled to build upon him, ſtill the whole weight of all that is built muſt reſt upon that eternal rock. Mr. <hi>M—n</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to cite a large number of ſcriptures, which prove that all men will finally partake of the fruit of their doings, and then ſays, <q>I have been the more particular upon this great duty of good works, becauſe there are many in theſe latter days, that ſeem to have little or no dependence upon good works in order to ſalvation. It is true, they will allow that good works are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to adorn a diſciple, but not to make a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Chriſt, though our Lord ſaith, ſo ſhall ye be my diſciples, that is in bearing much fruit,</q> p. 23. This is too plain to require much anſwer, though if the old gentleman ſhould live till next fall, I ſhould be glad if he would go into a good orchard, and examine carefully among all the trees, <hi>adorned</hi> with good fruit, whether he can find any fruit that <hi>made</hi> the tree good which it grows upon, or whether the tree does not evidence by this fruit, that it was a good tree before? And alſo to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider well, whether the way to promote its future fruitfulneſs would be to turn up its <hi>roots,</hi> that it might now ſtand upon its lovely fruit! If he will then be pleaſed to read the following texts, I ſuppoſe
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:011971_0031_0F92A4608F37D020"/>he will have a ſufficient anſwer: <hi>Matt.</hi> xii. 33. <hi>Rom.</hi> xi. 18.</p>
               <p>However, ſince he holds that good works <hi>make</hi> diſciples, and repreſents that we hold otherwiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we would obtain eternal life in a way <q>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier than to cut off the right hand, or pluck out the right eye, or to deny ſelf, and take up our croſs, and follow Chriſt in the ſtrait and narrow way,</q> p. 21. I ſhall bring things a little nearer home; for if I am not much miſtaken, this very man holds the external acts of baptiſm, and laying on of hands, which are done but <hi>once</hi> in a perſon's life, to be ſo eſſential to <hi>make</hi> diſciples, that he will have no ſort of religious fellowſhip with any without them, while thoſe who have them are freely received to his communion, though they have no viſible worſhip <hi>daily</hi> in their families, nor <hi>weekly</hi> regard to the Lord's day, only in time of worſhip; notwithſtanding the ſame ſacred writer who calls us to <hi>leave Jewiſh</hi> principles concerning Chriſt, tells us that there <hi>remaineth</hi> a <hi>reſt</hi> (or <hi>ſabbath,</hi> as the margin has it) to the people of God, chap. iv. 9. Now obſerve, 1. his naming the <hi>ſeventh day,</hi> and then ſpeaking of <hi>another day</hi> which <hi>remaineth,</hi> and giving a like reaſon to inforce the latter, as was given to inforce the former, plainly implies that a particular day of the week is referred to in both; for in verſe 4 he recites the reaſon by which the ſeventh day was inforced, and then to inforce this reſt that remaineth, ſays in ver. 10. <hi>For</hi> HE <hi>that is entered into his reſt,</hi> HE <hi>alſo hath ceaſed from his own works,</hi> As GOD <hi>did from his.</hi> And as it is certain that the Son reſted from the work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption on the <hi>firſt day,</hi> as the Father did from
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:011971_0032_0F92A4615C772F88"/>the work of creation on the <hi>ſeventh,</hi> who will dare to ſay that He, <hi>He alſo,</hi> that <hi>reſted</hi> AS GOD <hi>did,</hi> can mean any other than the Son, whom all men are required to <hi>honour, even</hi> AS <hi>they honour the Father? John</hi> v. 23.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is readily granted, that the Apoſtle's aim is to engage ſouls to <hi>hear</hi> and <hi>believe</hi> the goſpel, whereby they <hi>enter into</hi> ſpiritual <hi>reſt</hi> here, and eternal <hi>reſt</hi> hereafter, which as much exceeds the reſt which <hi>Jeſus,</hi> i. e. <hi>Joſhua,</hi> gave <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Canaan,</hi> as heaven exceeds earth; the <hi>goſpel</hi> which <hi>firſt gives reſt</hi> to <hi>heavy laden ſouls,</hi> in order that they might take Chriſt's <hi>yoke,</hi> and <hi>work</hi> for him<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Matt.</hi> xi. 28.</note>; while the <hi>law</hi> enjoined <hi>ſix days work</hi> before their <hi>reſt</hi> on the <hi>ſeventh,</hi> and the long <hi>fatigues</hi> of the wilderneſs, before their <hi>reſt</hi> in <hi>Canaan:</hi> But how can the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel be heard without a <hi>preacher</hi> 
                  <note n="§" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> x. 14.</note>, and without a <hi>time</hi> to meet for that purpoſe? Hence after our apoſtle had ſhewn, that the worſhip inſtituted by Chriſt was as much ſuperior to that appointed by <hi>Moſes,</hi> as the Son is ſuperior to a ſervant, and that Chriſt's houſe is his church, he immediately began his comment upon <hi>David</hi>'s words, which reach down to the place we are now upon; the tenor of all which is, to ſhew the importance of hearing and regarding the <hi>voice</hi> of Chriſt in his goſpel, and which is preached in his church, in this language, <hi>To-day, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</hi> And though this ſhould be the preacher's language in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon<note n="‖" place="bottom">2d <hi>Tim.</hi> iv. 2.</note>, yet that is ſo far from diſproving the appointment of a <hi>ſtated ſeaſon</hi> for worſhip under the goſpel, that it ſtrongly
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:011971_0033_0F92A461EEAB9220"/>implies ſuch an appointment. For as our apoſtle began this ſubject, with obſerving the ſuperiority of the worſhip appointed in the Chriſtian church, to that of the <hi>Jews;</hi> ſo he calls us in v. 14 to <hi>hold faſt our profeſſion;</hi> not only our faith, but alſo our profeſſion of it; which call is renewed in chap. x. 23—25, with a further explanation of how it is to be done, namely, by <hi>conſidering one another, to provoke unto love and good works; not forſaking the aſſembling of ourſelves together, as the manner of ſome is; but exhorting one another,</hi> &amp;c. Neither meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, days, nor ordinances, can be obſerved aright without faith; and if we are true believers, we <hi>are come to the General Aſſembly, and church of the firſt-born, which are written in heaven,</hi> chap. xii. 22, 23. And in the ſame chapter we are commanded to make <hi>ſtrait paths for our feet;</hi> but what <hi>crooked</hi> work do men make, if they take internals to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude externals, or externals to exclude internals, or put one for the other, to ſuit their own turn? And may we not as juſtly ſay, becauſe we <hi>are come</hi> by faith to the <hi>general aſſembly of the church,</hi> that therefore we have no warrant for external church aſſemblies, as to argue, becauſe we which have believed <hi>do enter into reſt,</hi> that therefore no particular day now <hi>remaineth</hi> for Chriſtians to <hi>reſt</hi> in from all worldly affairs, notwithſtanding the text expreſly ſpeaks of <hi>another day</hi> which <hi>remaineth</hi> to the people of God, diſtinct from the <hi>ſeventh,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced with a like reaſon as that was?</p>
               <p>Again, though ſome make much uſe of <hi>Paul</hi>'s caution againſt letting any man judge us in reſpect of an <hi>holy-day, new-moon, ſabbath-days,</hi> or <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances;</hi> yet how plain is it, that he is there ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:011971_0034_0F92A4665F6988D0"/>of the <hi>hand-writing of ordinances,</hi> which Chriſt <hi>took out of the way, nailing it to his croſs,</hi> and ſo could not be retained in Chriſtian worſhip, only by the <hi>traditions</hi> and <hi>commandments</hi> of <hi>men? Col.</hi> ii. 14—22. But how <hi>crooked</hi> is it, to take what was ſpoken againſt <hi>Jewiſh</hi> ceremonies, to exclude goſpel ordinances, or the obſervation of the Lord's day? In the ſame chapter the apoſtle ſays, <hi>Though I be abſent in the fleſh, yet am I with you in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, joying and beholding your order;</hi> and another apoſtle ſays, <hi>Ye need not that any man teech you, but as the ſome anointing teacheth you of all things;</hi> what warrant then have men or women to meet externally, to teach others, or hear others teach them? Let this be fairly anſwered, and we do not fear having as good an anſwer in the caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jewiſh</hi> ordinances were types of things to come, but Chriſtian ordinances are memorials of what is already done, and to ſtir us up to a right behaviour towards God, and towards each other; therefore let us never take what was written againſt the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the law, to exclude any appointment of the goſpel: And ſince the Son of God reſted from the work of purchaſing our redemption, on the firſt day of the week, and we have the example of his diſciples meeting on that day, for worſhip, and to break bread, <hi>John</hi> xx. 19, 26. <hi>Acts</hi> xx. 7. Since the ſaints liberality, which is an <hi>odour of a ſweet ſmell, a ſacrifice acceptable, well-pleaſing to God,</hi> was commanded to be offered on that day, <hi>Phil.</hi> iv. 18. 1ſt <hi>Cor.</hi> xvi. 2. and as a table and ſupper, ſet apart from a common to a ſacred uſe, is called the <hi>Lord's table,</hi> and the <hi>Lord's ſupper,</hi> ſo we have a

               <p>Again our apoſtle ſays, <hi>We have an altar</hi> (by which he evidently means Chriſt) <hi>by him therefore let us offer the ſacrifice of praiſe to God</hi> CONTINUAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY, <hi>that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his name, Heb.</hi> xiii. 10, 15. and as this was written to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> who can doubt of his having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerence here to their <hi>morning</hi> and <hi>evening ſacrifice,</hi> which they were commanded to offer upon the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, <hi>day by day continually</hi>—a <hi>continual</hi> burnt offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoughout their generations, <hi>Exod.</hi> xxix. 38, 42 which is afterward called the <hi>continual</hi> burnt offering, not leſs than ten times in two chapters<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Levit.</hi> xxviii. and xxix. See more of this in my ſermon on Family Prayer.</note>? And take notice, this ſpiritual ſacrifice is required to be offered <hi>continually</hi> with our <hi>lips;</hi> and what can that mean leſs than vocal addreſſes to the throne of grace, as often as their morning and evening offerings were? eſpecially when we remember that our Lord has taught his diſciples to pray after this manner, <hi>Our Father,</hi>—give us <hi>this day</hi> our daily bread; not this week, this month, or this year, but <hi>this day;</hi> how plainly does it imply our duty to come, not only perſonally in ſecret, but alſo unitedly in our families, to <hi>our</hi> Father, <hi>every day?</hi> We are alſo commanded to <hi>pray always with all prayer, Eph.</hi> vi. 18. and ſurely, <hi>all prayer</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes family prayer as well as other.</p>
               <p>Having given a little ſketch of the ſcripture au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority for theſe duties, I can freely leave it with every conſcience to judge, whether it looks more like <hi>denying ſelf,</hi> and taking up our <hi>croſs daily,</hi> to
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:011971_0036_0F92A46806D04728"/>riſe from our beds in the morning, and return to them again at night; to go to, and return from, our food, with no more viſible acknowledgent of our great preſerver and benefactor than the ox that eateth graſs; than it does to realize how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent we are upon him continually, ſo as to have our prayer <hi>daily</hi> come up before him as incenſe, and the lifting up of our hands as the evening ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and whenever we <hi>eat,</hi> to <hi>give God thanks, Rom.</hi> xiv. 6. And whether it looks more like plucking out a right eye, or cutting off a right hand, to make God's houſe ſo much a houſe of <hi>merchandize,</hi> as to carry <hi>our worldly ſchemes</hi> even into the intermiſſion of worſhip on the <hi>Lord's day,</hi> and not wait till the day is over, before we begin to <hi>ſell corn,</hi> and <hi>ſet forth wheat,</hi> than it does to <hi>regard the whole day as holy to the Lord, and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> and <hi>honour him, not doing our own ways, nor finding our own pleaſure, nor ſpeaking our own words.</hi> And though many are hypocritical while they pretend to theſe duties, yet may it not well appear ſurprizing, to ſee any profeſſed Chriſtians make that an excuſe for their own neglect, which is the ſame excuſe that infidels make for their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of all religion! as if others wrongs would excuſe us from doing right!</p>
               <p>How far tradition may have inſnared and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed good men, with reſpect to theſe things, I do not pretend to ſay: I have experienced enough in other traditions, to teach me the importance of treating all men with candour and charity, and yet to abhor the <hi>lukewarmneſs</hi> which many would cover under thoſe lovely names, whereby religion is treated as if it was only a piece of ſtate policy,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:011971_0037_0F92A468D1B48050"/>that might be turned into any ſhape, as occaſion or intereſt ſuited. Charity is love to God and man, which moves the ſoul to reverence our Creator, and to regard our fellow-creatures in their ſeveral ſtations and relations; and all diſpoſitions and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions contrary thereto are ſin, let men call them what they will. <hi>Charity rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth,</hi> and therefore moves thoſe who are under its influence to exert themſelves in their ſeveral ſtations, to promote the cauſe of truth in the world. And ſince the cuſtom of caſting off fear, and reſtraining prayer before God, greatly prevails in our nation and land, and alſo of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaning the Lord's day with carnal ſchemes, eaſe or diverſions; and many ſtrengthen themſelves therein, by the looſe principles and conduct of ſome teachers and profeſſors, ſurely it is high time for us all to awake, and bear a more bold teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny againſt ſuch ways than has yet been done. What! ſhall we, under a pretence of owning every day to be the Lord's, rob him of a great part, or the whole, of the one day that is conſecrated for his worſhip! What! under a pretence of <hi>ſpiritual</hi> worſhip, ſhall we indulge our <hi>carnal</hi> eaſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, till ſome awakening providence, or powerful influence, pulls us from our ſluggiſh beds! Shall a pretence of <hi>heart-worſhip</hi> any more be brought to excuſe the neglect of <hi>confeſſing with our mouths,</hi> and <hi>daily</hi> offering to God the fruit of our <hi>lips,</hi> giving thanks to his name! The apoſtle <hi>James</hi>'s language to the pretenders to faith and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible religion in his day was, <hi>Shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will ſhew thee my faith by my works.</hi> So now, ſhew to thy family, if thou
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:011971_0038_0F92A4698566B890"/>canſt, that thou doſt believe all good things come from God, while they rarely, if ever, hear thee worſhip him, or give him thanks therefor! Shew to any man, if you can, that you believe every day to be the Lord's, while you don't keep one day to him, without filling a great part of it with <hi>your own ways,</hi> and <hi>your own pleaſures!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The great point which brought ruin upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> was their refuſing to <hi>render to God the fruits of his vineyard in their ſeaſons;</hi> but inſtead of it, abuſing his ſervants, and then killing his Son, with this aim,—<hi>The inberitance ſhall be ours, Matt.</hi> xxi. 33—41. <hi>Mark</hi> xii. 1—9. And alas! how much of the ſame diſpoſition is working at this day, to try to get time, and all its advantages, to be <hi>ours!</hi> Surely their <hi>deſolate</hi> land, which <hi>enjoys her ſabbaths, Levit.</hi> xxvi. 34, 43. calls like thunder to us, to beware of ſuch ways, leſt, as we have greater light, we bring on ourſelves, and our land, a greater vengeance than they did. Indeed 'tis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon for perſons now to exclaim againſt the old <hi>Phariſees,</hi> for their hypocriſy, <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (juſt as they did againſt others, <hi>Matt.</hi> xxiii. 29—31) while they diſcover ſad tokens of their going in the ſame way, be ſeeking life, <hi>not by faith, but as it were by the deeds of the law;</hi> which deeds yet are only ſome <hi>leſſer matters,</hi> while <hi>juſtice, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> and <hi>faithfulneſs,</hi> are neglected.</p>
               <p>How far our author, or any of his admirers, are guilty in any of theſe reſpects, I don't pretend to determine, but leave that to God and their own conſciences; and am far from thinking myſelf bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by nature that they: Yet who can hear men tell of <q>building their hope upon their faith and
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:011971_0039_0F92A46A476AFCA0"/>obedience;" of "<hi>Dependence</hi> upon good works in order to ſalvation,</q> and that our good works not only <hi>adorn,</hi> but alſo <q>
                     <hi>Make</hi> diſciples of Chriſt,</q> and not warn them of their danger! This is ſo far from the good old way to heaven, that <hi>Job,</hi> who was a <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>upright</hi> walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, yet upon a near view of the divine Being, cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, <hi>Behold I am vile!</hi> and again, <hi>I abhor my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf!</hi> ſo far was he from truſting to himſelf or his doings, <hi>Job</hi> i. 1. xl. 4. and xlii. 6. The man after God's own heart was ſo far from building his hope upon his faith, or his works, that he ſays, <hi>Thou art my hope, O Lord; thou art my truſt from my youth;</hi> and when he was <hi>old and grey-headed,</hi> his language was, <hi>I will go in the ſtrength of the Lord God; I will make mention of thy righteouſneſs, even of thine</hi> ONLY, <hi>Pſal.</hi> lxxi. 5, 16. A near view of a <hi>holy</hi> God, cauſed that eminent ſaint, the prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> to cry out, <hi>Wo is me, for I am undone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am a man of unclean lips!</hi> and nothing could relieve him but a living application from, God's <hi>altar,</hi> by which his <hi>iniquity was taken away, and his ſin purged;</hi> which moved him to ready obedience, ſaying, <hi>Here am I, ſend me.</hi> He would not go of his own head, but was ready to obey the divine call, <hi>Iſa.</hi> vi. 5—8. So now, we muſt all have our <hi>conſcience purged from dead works, by Chriſt's blood,</hi> in order to <hi>ſerve the living God, Heb.</hi> ix. 14. The character of goſpel believers is, they worſhip God in the ſpirit, rejoice in Chriſt Jeſus, and have NO <hi>confidence in the fleſh;</hi> that is, in their own doings: And they are warned to <hi>beware</hi> of all that teach otherwiſe, as creatures that are both odious and dangerous, <hi>Phil.</hi> iii. 2, 3.</p>

                  <hi>PART II.</hi> Wherein is opened the <hi>Conſiſtency</hi> and Duty of hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth Divine Sovereignty, and Man's Impotency, while yet we addreſs their Conſciences with the Warnings of Truth, and Calls of the Goſpel.</head>
               <p>AFTER I had written the principal part of that diſcourſe upon faith, which I have now been vindicating, Mr. <hi>Sandeman</hi>'s letters were put into my hands, with a requeſt that I would care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully examine them, and remark on what I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to be amiſs; in doing of which, ſome things appeared to me to be of ſo dangerous a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that I thought it a duty to expoſe them pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly; and accordingly inſerted a few remarks in my introduction, referring to the body of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe for a poſitive opening of my views of the right way. But a number of people, not obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in a note, page 25, I had thus referred them forward, and ſuppoſing that the grand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of my writing was againſt him, have accuſed me of the ſame crime I charge upon him, <hi>viz.</hi> of only picking out what was wrong in writers, and paſſing over what was right. Whereas my firſt and main deſign had no concern with him, and as he owns that he has adopted the good ſentiments of others, <q>Without quoting them, or mentioning their names,</q> how could I do juſtice in reciting
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:011971_0041_0F92A46BC72792D0"/>them as his, when I knew not whoſe they were? Therefore I cited one excellent paſſage, and then endeavoured to point out ſome of the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſnares that I diſcovered in his writings, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring to the following diſcourſe to explain my views of the truth. Nevertheleſs I freely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that my love of brevity left ſome things in too much obſcurity, eſpecially upon the diſtinction between doctrinal and experimental knowledge. My idea of the difference is, that a perſon may truly be ſlain by the law, and made alive by the goſpel, and yet not know, perhaps not have a thought, that what he has experienced is the change called converſion; but doctrinal teaching may be a means of opening clearly to him, that it is the very change deſcribed in ſcripture by that name. Chriſt's diſciples had experienced <hi>the way</hi> of acceſs to the Father, yet they denied that they <hi>knew</hi> it, when he mentioned it under that name, <hi>John</hi> xiv. 4, 5. On the other hand, men may learn to talk orthodoxly or critically concerning theſe things, while they do not truly know them. This is the diſtinction I meant, and the occaſion of mentioning it was, his repreſenting that a man could not have <q>Known and preached, truſted, and loved the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for many years,</q> if now his mind was <hi>relieved</hi> and his <hi>views</hi> more <hi>cleared</hi> by his writings; and I ſtill think that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation to be falſe; But I uſed one expreſſion that I now utterly retract, <hi>viz. right</hi> notions in the head, without knowing the truth in the heart; for I believe right ideas will always produce right effects upon our hearts and lives, and that all mens notions about truth, which do not produce ſuch
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:011971_0042_0F92A46E3054ECC0"/>effects, are not <hi>right</hi> notions; but a holding the <hi>truth in unrighteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>changing truth into a lie;</hi> and thoſe who receive not the love of the truth will be damned, becauſe they <hi>believe not the truth;</hi> but <hi>believe a lie, Rom.</hi> i. 18, 25. 2d <hi>Theſ.</hi> ii. 10—12. and one well obſerves, that perhaps the lie they believed was, <q>That if they did penance, and performed a number of good duties, they ſhould by that means procure an intereſt in the juſtifying righteouſneſs of Chriſt.</q> And how much has this ſtrong deluſion ſpread through the world! Indeed the modes of <hi>doing</hi> are very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, ſome placing it more in external forms, others in internal exerciſes; and though they ſeem to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer greatly, yet how many agree in <hi>doing for life,</hi> inſtead of <hi>receiving all by faith,</hi> that they may <hi>live unto God!</hi> Probably ſome will ſay, theſe are Mr. <hi>S—u</hi>'s ſentiments: I know he ſuggeſts many ſuch things in his writings, and I would never op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe truth there any more than elſewhere; but I have ſeen as good wheat laid to bait a net, as that which is laid up in the garner; and an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a ſnare for ſouls, baited with choice truths and keen turns of wit, was the only occaſion of my writing againſt him; which ſnare appears in ſuch terms as theſe <q>Aſſurance of hope is enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only by thoſe who give all diligence to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, in the ſelf-denied works of obedience;</q> and he ſays, <q>No man can be charged with the ſin of diſbelieving the goſpel, for <hi>doubting</hi> if he be a good Chriſtian; his chief hazard lies on the other ſide;</q> yet in anſwer to his friend's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of a clearer explanation of this point, he ſays, <q>We muſt not conſider the perſon advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:011971_0043_0F92A46EB5021950"/>to the aſſurance of hope, as engaged in a certain round of duties, ſo as his comfort ſhould ariſe from a <hi>conſciouſneſs</hi> of his performing, or deſigning to perform, them from <hi>right motives,</hi> let them be called motives ariſing from the <hi>faith,</hi> or by any other name: Thus the Chriſtian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion would become a <hi>Phariſaical</hi> ſcheme<note n="*" place="bottom">Epiſtolary Correſpondence, <hi>Glaſgow</hi> edition, page 86.</note>
                  </q> This is ſo far from truth, that if we could ſpeak with the tongues of men and angels, if we could underſtand all myſteries and all knowledge, and perform the <hi>ſelf-denied works</hi> of giving all our goods to feed the poor, and our bodies to the flames, yet unleſs theſe were performed from a <hi>good prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> and <hi>right motives,</hi> we ſhould ſtill <hi>be nothing,</hi> and all our doings <hi>profit us nothing,</hi> 1ſt <hi>Cor.</hi> xiii. 1—3. And though he aſſerts, that <q>A perſon by being brought to the knowledge of the truth, is not thereby led to think himſelf poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of ſome <hi>good principle,</hi> by which he ſtands more nearly <hi>related to God</hi> than he was, or than other men; his comfort does not lie in think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on any thing about himſelf, or any <hi>change</hi> he has undergone; but he is comforted in think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on what is <hi>without</hi> him, on what is <hi>abſent</hi> from him, even on what is in heaven<note n="‖" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Ibid.</hi> page 82, 83.</note>
                  </q> Yet <hi>Paul</hi> ſhews that the <hi>good principle</hi> of <hi>charity</hi> out of a <hi>pure heart, good conſcience,</hi> and <hi>faith unfeigned,</hi> is ſo eſſential to obedience, that he who <hi>ſwerves</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from underſtands neither <hi>what he ſays, nor where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he affirms;</hi> and that the ſaint is comforted in his near <hi>relation to God,</hi> by having the <hi>ſpirit of adoption</hi> ſent <hi>into his heart;</hi> and alſo by beholding
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:011971_0044_0F92A46F71498DC0"/>the divine glories, whereby he is <hi>changed into the ſame image;</hi> and he calls profeſſors to <hi>examine</hi> themſelves, for they ought to <hi>know</hi> that Chriſt is IN <hi>them,</hi> except they are <hi>reprobates,</hi> 1ſt <hi>Tim.</hi> i. 5—7. <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 15. 2d <hi>Cor.</hi> iii. 18. and xiii. 5. This is ſo far from a <hi>Phariſaical ſcheme,</hi> that the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> ſcheme was, to make a great pretence of ſelf-denial and <hi>outward</hi> obedience, without any regard to an <hi>inward change,</hi> or acting from <hi>right motives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And though the plan now before us talks much of the croſs and ſelf-denial, yet it is ſo much more fleſh-pleaſing than the <hi>carnal ordinances</hi> of the law, that the law appointed but <hi>three <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

Love is the temper of happineſs, and without it there can be none, and the nobler its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the greater the happineſs, and the eaſier to obey the precept; how holy, juſt, and good, then is this law, which requires our higheſt love to the ſupreme fountain of being and excellency, and our ſubordinate love to all other beings, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their relation and connexion to him and to us? This law then conſtituted an union of heart between the whole ſyſtem of rational beings, which influenced to all right behaviour toward each
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:011971_0047_0F92A4734DD5F630"/>other, according to their ſeveral ſtations and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and the fruit of ſuch behaviour is, <hi>This do and thou ſhalt live.</hi> Hence learn,</p>
               <p n="1">I. That the nature of this law is immutable and perpetual, and it is as vain for any one ſoul to think of ever being exempted for one moment from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to love God with all the heart, and our neighbour as ourſelves, as to think of dethroning him, or annihilating our own ſouls; for as long as we remain his creatures, 'tis impoſſible but that we muſt remain under obligation to love and obey him.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Here we may learn the true nature of ſin; it is the <hi>tranſgreſſion of this law;</hi> it is a revolt from the Creator, and ſetting up the creature in his ſtead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.25. Hence we are told, that of the three <hi>Hebrew</hi> words ordinarily uſed for it, tranſgreſſion ſignifies <hi>rebellion;</hi> iniquity, <hi>crookedneſs, perverſeneſs;</hi> and ſin, a <hi>miſſing the mark</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Gill</hi>'s Expoſition on <hi>Pſal.</hi> li. 1, 2.</note> And ſurely the ſource of all our woes was a <hi>rebellion</hi> againſt our rightful king and lawgiver, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide to our own <hi>crooked, perverſe</hi> ways, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we <hi>miſs the mark</hi> both of our duty and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and the immediate conſequence was loſs of union and communion with God, which is <hi>ſpiritual death;</hi> innumerable evils in this world, that at length diſſolve the union between ſoul and body, which is <hi>natural death;</hi> and finally will be the caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſoul and body into the burning lake, which is <hi>eternal death;</hi> all which are the juſt <hi>wages of ſin.</hi> And mark it, death is to be always viewed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its nature; the death of a rational ſoul is as different from that of the body, as ſpirit is from
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:011971_0048_0F8805BC3A381938"/>clay; the body without union with the ſoul can do nothing at all; the ſoul without union with God can do nothing right; but a ſoul <hi>dead in ſin</hi> ſtill <hi>walks,</hi> and is ſometimes more active than a ſaint, and for this plain reaſon, the ſinner's powers are all bent one way, while the ſaint has in him, as it were, the company of two armies, ſo that the children of this world are in their generation <hi>wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the children of light, Luke</hi> xvi. 8. <hi>Eph.</hi> ii. 1, 2. Hence all attempts to repreſent addreſſes to ſinners conſciences, to be like addreſſes to ſenſleſs carcaſes, are attempts <hi>to darken counſel,</hi> and belong to the kingdom of darkneſs.</p>
               <p n="3">III. How vain are mens hopes of getting life by their own <hi>doings,</hi> in any ſhape whatever? Chriſt ſays, THIS DO <hi>and thou ſhalt live;</hi> it is not wouldings, promiſes or endeavours, that will avail without <hi>doing,</hi> doing <hi>this; this</hi> perfect, <hi>this</hi> univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, <hi>this</hi> immutable law of love; <hi>love</hi> to God and man, <hi>love</hi> with all our <hi>ſoul</hi> and <hi>mind,</hi> as well as ſtrength. Therefore the law is <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> but we are <hi>carnal;</hi> all inclinations as well as actions that are contrary, or that do not come up to this law of love, are ſin; hence our Lord, upon occaſion of a lovely youth who had ſhewn an outward regard to the law all his days, and yet had ſuch a love to this world, that he would not part with it for Chriſt, declared to his diſciples, that it is <hi>eaſier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle,</hi> than for ſuch a man to enter into the kingdom of heaven; but they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſtoniſhed, he adds, <hi>with man it is impoſſible, but not with God, Mark</hi> x. 17—27. Two things make it <hi>impoſſible</hi> with man, one is, he cannot make up his paſt breach of the law, and the other is, he
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:011971_0049_0F8805BCF9DBEB90"/>cannot now turn his heart from earth to heaven, though God can do both; which brings us,</p>
               <p n="4">IV. To the nature and deſign of the goſpel. Man was become a <hi>rebel</hi> againſt the eternal King, by breaking the beſt of all laws, by which he had forfeited life, and was neither able to ſatisfy for his crime, nor to change his heart; therefore the King's Son engaged to do the one, and the holy ſpirit to effect the other; not by abating the law, as ſome vainly dream; no, Jeſus warns us againſt ſuch a <hi>thought,</hi> and declares, that <hi>Till heaven and earth paſs, one</hi> JOT <hi>or one</hi> TITTLE <hi>ſhall in no wiſe paſs from the law, till</hi> ALL <hi>be fulfilled, Matt.</hi> v. 18. He fulfilled it by taking the rebels place, and obeying and ſuffering for our ſins, <hi>The juſt for the unjuſt, that he might bring us unto God, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him;</hi> that God might be <hi>juſt, and the juſtifier of him which believeth in Jeſus;</hi> might juſtify the <hi>ungodly, Rom.</hi> iii. 26. and iv. 5. 2d <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 18—20. 1ſt <hi>Pet.</hi> iii. 18. In conſequence of which, the goſpel <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims liberty to priſoners</hi> and <hi>captives, Iſa.</hi> lxi. 1. <hi>Luke</hi> iv. 18. Surely not an exemption from the King's authority and government! No; but liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from the juſt ſentence of <hi>death,</hi> from Satan's <hi>tyranny,</hi> and from the <hi>bondage of corruption,</hi> into the glorious <hi>liberty of the ſons of God;</hi> liberty to ſerve him in <hi>newneſs of ſpirit,</hi> and <hi>not in the oldneſs of the letter, Rom.</hi> vii. 6. The oldneſs of the letter was, The man that <hi>doth them</hi> ſhall <hi>live in them; this do and thou ſhalt live; but curſed is every one that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth not to do all.</hi> The newneſs of the ſpirit is, Chriſt delivers from the <hi>curſe,</hi> and gives the <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing;</hi> gives the covenant bleſſing of the ſpirit to
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:011971_0050_0F8805BDBA149378"/>write the law in our <hi>hearts,</hi> with this tenor, <hi>I will,</hi> and <hi>they ſhall, Gal.</hi> iii. 10—14. <hi>Heb.</hi> viii. 10. The oldneſs of the letter promiſed life upon doing, but gave no ſtrength to do; the newneſs of the ſpirit ſays, As thy days, ſo ſhall thy ſtrength be; my grace is ſufficient for thee; I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee: It calls us to come boldly to the throne of grace for all the help we need. The oldneſs of the letter gives no encouragement to come only upon our own doings, and ſets a flaming ſword in the way of the guilty; but the newneſs of the ſpirit directs us to take all our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to come, from the merits, interceſſion and promiſe of our great High Prieſt, who has engaged <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>faithfulneſs</hi> to <hi>forgive</hi> the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to <hi>cleanſe</hi> the filthy, <hi>Heb.</hi> iv. 14—16. 1ſt <hi>John,</hi> i. 9. As the ſtrength of ſin is the law, the letter arms the <hi>accuſer</hi> againſt the ſoul that dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly breaks it; but the ſpirit enables the believer to <hi>overcome</hi> him, by the <hi>blood</hi> of the Lamb, and by ſuch a view of heavenly glories, as to carry their <hi>love</hi> even above <hi>life</hi> itſelf, <hi>Rev.</hi> xii. 11. In a word, the <hi>letter killeth,</hi> but the <hi>ſpirit giveth life,</hi> 2d <hi>Cor.</hi> iii. 6.</p>
               <p>Yet notwithſtanding this diſtinction is written ſo plain that he may run that reads it, many ſtill dwell upon the oldneſs of the letter, and reckon it <q>Strange and unaccountable, that any ſhould aſſert that there is nothing to be <hi>done by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in order</hi> to their ſalvation, beſide believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Mayhew</hi>'s ſermons on ſtriving to enter the ſtrait gate, page 31, 32.</note>!</q> as if they had never read <hi>Rom.</hi> iii. 28, and iv. 5.</p>

I ſuppoſe this author has ſtated this point as fairly as any have done on that ſide of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. He ſays, <q>The queſtion is, whether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate ſinners, under the diſpenſation of the goſpel, have <hi>any</hi> day of grace and ſalvation af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded to them, in ſuch a ſenſe, that they ſhall certainly obtain eternal life, provided they hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily deſire it, and ſtrive to that end?</q> And he aſſerts, that <q>There is a certain connexion between ſinners ſtriving to obtain the ſalvation which God has revealed, and their actually obtaining it<note n="‖" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Ibid.</hi> page 46.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But what is <hi>the</hi> ſalvation which God has reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? It is from <hi>enemies</hi> to be <hi>reconciled</hi> and <hi>ſaved</hi> by his Son, <hi>Rom.</hi> v. 10. And what is there to be <hi>done</hi> by ſinners, in <hi>order</hi> to <hi>this</hi> ſalvation? Their rebellion is atoned for by the King's Son, and he <hi>beſeeches</hi> and <hi>prays</hi> them to be <hi>reconciled;</hi> how then can the ſinner <hi>heartily deſire this</hi> ſalvation, and yet have ſomething to <hi>do,</hi> before he obtains it? 2d <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 20. And what do men mean by a day of grace, if 'tis the day in which the King pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims the goſpel way of reconciliation, and ſends his ſervants to preach to ſinners, and his ſpirit to <hi>ſtrive</hi> with them, while his long-ſuffering <hi>waits;</hi> yet ever with this language, Behold, NOW is the accepted time, behold, NOW is <hi>the day</hi> of ſalvation! Come, for all things are <hi>now ready,</hi> 1ſt <hi>Pet.</hi> iii. 18—20. 2d <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. 2. <hi>Luke</hi> xiv. 17. Such a day of grace we readily grant all ſinners under the light of the goſpel have. But if the goſpel ſays, <hi>Come, all things are now ready,</hi> and the ſpirit <hi>ſtrives</hi> to convince the ſinner of the truth of it; I deſire to
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:011971_0052_0F8805BF39C97118"/>know what the ſinner's <hi>ſtriving</hi> is before he comes? We all know, that <hi>ſtriving</hi> implies <hi>reſiſtance</hi> of one againſt another; and thoſe who in ancient time en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ſo often what they <hi>ſhould do, Stephen</hi> plainly told them to their heads what they <hi>did do:</hi>—Ye <hi>do always reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt, Acts</hi> vii. 51.</p>
               <p>There can be no half-way; the inſtant we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the goſpel, we are reconciled to God, and unite in ſtriving againſt all his and our enemies, <hi>ſtriving</hi> according to his working in and by us, <hi>Col.</hi> i. 29. <hi>Phil.</hi> iii. 14. And if we are not united with him, we <hi>believe</hi> not the <hi>truth,</hi> but have <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> in <hi>unrighteouſneſs,</hi> let us talk of ſpeculative faith, or good deſires, what we will, 2d <hi>Theſ.</hi> ii. 12. And to talk of repentance before faith, is more abſurd ſtill; for who ever was ſorry for any action, before he believed it to be ſome way diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable! It is conviction of the <hi>truth</hi> of the law that cauſes legal repentance, and looking by <hi>faith</hi> on him whom we have pierced, produces evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical repentance: Hence <hi>Paul</hi>'s conſtant teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny both to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Greeks</hi> was, <hi>Repentance</hi> toward God, and <hi>faith</hi> toward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> xx. 21. He firſt taught them their caſe before God, as breakers of his law, and then the way of reconciliation, by faith in Chriſt, who has ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled it; with which compare <hi>Mark</hi> i. 15. The Pſalmiſt, when his heart was inditing good matter concerning <hi>Zion</hi>'s King, deſcribes this work in a very elegant manner, which is, that being armed with <hi>truth,</hi> meekneſs and righteouſneſs, he in his majeſty rides forth proſperouſly, and darts his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows into his <hi>enemies hearts;</hi> and all know that a wound there is death; accordingly they <hi>fall under
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:011971_0053_0F8805BFF9CAB938"/>him;</hi> but how ſtout is the rebel that will fight till he dies! <hi>Paul</hi> can tell experimentally the nature of this death; it was death to his own <hi>doings,</hi> and the <hi>hope</hi> he built upon them, and he was <hi>ſlain</hi> thereto by the light of this holy law, which diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to him the <hi>deceit</hi> of his heart, which had operated in all his doings, <hi>Rom.</hi> vii. 9—14. <hi>Phil.</hi> iii. 4—9. Theſe appear to the ſinner <hi>terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things;</hi> but how is the ſcene changed, when he ſees the <hi>ſceptre of righteouſneſs</hi> preſented from the <hi>throne,</hi> which gains the <hi>enemy</hi> to become the <hi>Queen,</hi> moſt gloriouſly adorned! Thus are God's people <hi>made willing</hi> in the day of his <hi>power,</hi> to ſerve him in the <hi>beauty of holineſs, Pſal.</hi> xlv. and cx. <hi>Heb.</hi> i. 8, 9.</p>
               <p>I have been the more particular here to detect the deceit and blindneſs of the attempts that are often made, to repreſent irreſiſtible grace to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the ſoul's liberty of choice; for here are deſcriptions of the work of grace that are abſolutely irreſiſtible, if any thing can be ſo; and yet there is not the leaſt violence uſed with man's will, for the enemy is conquered with the full conſent of all his heart: He is ſlain and made alive by the power of truth. And further to detect the deluſion of many, and the falſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings that are often uſed concerning ſinners im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency, we will take a plain inſtance.</p>
               <p>In the late rebellion in our nation, a hope of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>able</hi> to uſurp the throne, moved the rebels to invade <hi>England;</hi> but when they had marched within a hundred miles of <hi>London,</hi> that hope <hi>fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> them, the effect of which was a haſty retreat back to <hi>Scotland;</hi> though by the way a hope of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <hi>able</hi> to keep the ſtrong city of <hi>Carliſle</hi> againſt their Sovereign, cauſed them to leave a party in it for that purpoſe; but the Duke of <hi>Cumberland</hi> ſoon convinced them of their miſtake, and then they hung out a ſign; and upon his demanding its meaning, they ſaid they wanted to <hi>capitulate.</hi> He replied, that he ſhould enter into no <hi>capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> with <hi>rebels!</hi> they ſhould ſurrender to the King's mercy: They did accordingly. Now let us ſee where we are; it has been ſufficiently proved that ſinners are rebels againſt heaven, and that they will ſtand out in their rebellion till they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered; and if it would have been diſhonourable to the King of <hi>England</hi> to have capitulated with theſe rebels, which yet were his fellow-men; what madneſs muſt it be to attempt to capitulate with rebels againſt the eternal God! What can all the noiſe mean concerning a day of grace, and good works for ſinners to <hi>do before</hi> they are reconciled to the King of heaven, but only <hi>inventions</hi> of men to <hi>keep off</hi> from ſurrendering to Sovereignty, in hopes by and by to come in upon better terms! in hopes at laſt to be received, not as rebels, but ſubjects, who all along had a good regard for their King, and only happened to be impoſed upon in ſome things. But be not deceived, God is not mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and all things are naked and opened to his eyes; all mens buildings which are not laid upon his precious <hi>corner ſtone,</hi> are nothing but <hi>refuges of lies,</hi> and God ſays, the <hi>Hail ſhall ſweep them away, Pſal.</hi> xxviii. 15—17.</p>
               <p>As to power or ability, who need be told, that <hi>in</hi> nations, and <hi>between</hi> nations, the way to keep enemies from doing miſchief, is to keep them ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:011971_0055_0F8805C179C4DD38"/>of their <hi>inability</hi> to do it? Even captives in the hands of ſavages whom they hate mortally, yet if they find they are <hi>unable</hi> to eſcape or to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them, they will be careful not to offend their cruel maſters; how much more then will convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even in a carnal mind, that it <hi>cannot</hi> eſcape from, nor withſtand a holy God, reſtrain it and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate its conduct? It is to this that we are indebted for much of the order and regulation in the world, which many falſly aſcribe to mens good nature, and then turn it as an argument againſt the truth!</p>
               <p>A ſenſe of impotency has like effect upon the principle of <hi>hope</hi> as it has upon <hi>fear;</hi> as long as perſons can hope to ſhift along themſelves, they do not love to be dependent and beholden to others, but the clearer their ſenſe is of being <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> to do without others help, the more earneſt will be their cries therefor.

And as falſe and murderous to ſouls are all pretences that <hi>impotency</hi> can excuſe any from their obligation this moment to <hi>receive</hi> God's <hi>teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> and ſet to their <hi>ſeal that he is true.</hi> Many plead <hi>impotency,</hi> and pretend <hi>honeſty</hi> in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining <hi>prayer</hi> before God; but they prove themſelves <hi>liars</hi> in theſe very pretences; for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane mariners, who often pretend <hi>honeſty</hi> in not ſeeking to God, becauſe they <hi>cannot</hi> do it aright, yet when once they are brought to their <hi>wits end,</hi>

               <p>A rational ſoul is always governed in its choice, by the preſent ideas it has of what is beſt, let thoſe ideas be true or deluſive. Thoſe who fall into the hands of ſavages, if they judge it beſt not to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, they will chooſe to ſell their lives as dear as they can; but if they judge it beſt to ſubmit, then they will chooſe to be on as good terms with them as they can: And ſays Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> 
                  <q>To ſuppoſe that in all things of a ſpiritual and eternal concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that men are not determined and actuated every one by his own judgment, is an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of men who think but little of what they are, or do, or ſay, or write.

               <p>One grand ſcheme of the learned free-willers of our day, to blind their own and others minds againſt theſe truths, is, to aſſert a ſelf-determining power <hi>in</hi> the will, a power to act with motive, or againſt motive, juſt as the will pleaſes; but how little are ſuch men aware, that they in this point <hi>approve</hi> of the deed of father <hi>Adam,</hi> at the ſame time that they deny their concern in it? The ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent propoſed it as a grand enlargement of our firſt parents <hi>liberty,</hi> that they ſhould <hi>Know both good and evil;</hi> ſhould be <hi>free</hi> to both; and he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that this was to be <hi>as Gods;</hi> they ventured to try the experiment, ventured to act againſt a good motive, in order to be free to act either way as they pleaſed afterwards; but they found by ſad experience that the ſerpent <hi>lied</hi> in this propoſal.</p>
               <p>With reverence be it ſpoken, the eternal God never had, nor never can have, ſuch a liberty as theſe men tell of; for it is <hi>impoſſible</hi> for him to <hi>lie,</hi> and he <hi>cannot be</hi> ſo much as <hi>tempted with evil, Heb.</hi> vi. 18. <hi>Jam.</hi> i. 13.

               <p>Thus far this great reaſoner has followed the clear line of truth, yet in the next words he turns into the dark way, by ſaying, "This we can do." If he had ſaid, we can do it when we are aſſiſted with divine light and truth, he had ſaid well; but
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:011971_0059_0F8805C479C903B8"/>without ſuch a proviſo the matter is left in the dark, becauſe evil imaginations and deſires have already got the ſtart of reaſon, ſo that it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bring them back to a fair examination without divine influence. Who is there that need be told, that if the judge is previouſly <hi>biaſed,</hi> we are not like to have a fair trial before him? Yet we are all ſo in this caſe; for a fair examination will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſhew that <hi>ſelf</hi> is guilty; and if only a <hi>gift</hi> from <hi>another</hi> will <hi>blind</hi> the eyes of the wiſe, and <hi>pervert</hi> the words of the <hi>righteous;</hi> how much more will the honour, eaſe, yea life of <hi>ſelf,</hi> blind the eyes of <hi>ſinners,</hi> and hold them from a fair conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of this caſe? For as God is the only foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all good, unbiaſed reaſon cannot but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine that every rational ſoul who loves and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues any thing whatſoever as good, ſeparate from, and in neglect of him, is certainly guilty; yet that is what we have <hi>all</hi> done, though all do not purſue it in the ſame courſe, for we have turned every one to <hi>His own way, Iſa.</hi> liii. 6. But who ever heard adjudge give in a ſentence, the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate effect of which would bring himſelf from the bench to the bar, as a guilty priſoner? Since therefore reaſon is already biaſed, divine revelation is erected as the tribunal to decide this controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy: And wherever it truly takes place, it produces the effect juſt now mentioned; a notable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of which we have recorded, <hi>Acts</hi> xxiv. 24, 25. A <hi>Roman</hi> governor and judge had the curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſend for his priſoner to hear him concerning the <hi>faith in Chriſt;</hi> but as the priſoner addreſſed the <hi>reaſon</hi> of the judge, concerning righteouſneſs, temperance, and a judgment to come, the ſcene
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:011971_0060_0F8805C539C08BC0"/>was remarkably changed; for the <hi>Roman</hi> judge inſtantly becomes a <hi>trembling</hi> priſoner, while the priſoner is the King's officer to ſummon him to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for his conduct at the awful bar. This was ſo diſagreeable that he <hi>put-off</hi> any further hearing for <hi>that time,</hi> and we have no grounds to think that the <hi>convenient ſeaſon</hi> he flattered himſelf with ever came; and if not, then he is now a <hi>ſpirit in priſon;</hi> while the record of his caſe ſtands for a warning to all others againſt the like <hi>diſobedience,</hi> while the long-ſuffering of God waits with them, 1ſt <hi>Pet.</hi> iii. 19, 20.</p>
               <p>But alas! inſtead of taking warning, we all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally have the lawyer's diſpoſition, who was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to <hi>juſtify himſelf;</hi> his mind was biaſed that way: But how could he do it? Why he leaves God out of the queſtion, and ſays, <hi>Who is my neighbour?</hi> This is a notable way to try rebels! for the judge to leave the King out of the queſtion, and only examine their behaviour to each other! Yet how poorly does he make out even in this way? For though they eſteemed themſelves ſo much better than the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> that they would have <hi>no dealings</hi> with them, yet our Lord ſets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him a caſe in their own country, between <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> and <hi>Jericho,</hi> which <hi>Jewiſh</hi> writers ſay, was then a ſtation for prieſts and <hi>Levites</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">See Dr. <hi>Gill</hi> on the place.</note>, of one of each of thoſe high characters who could <hi>look</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one whoſe caſe loudly called for their <hi>compaſſion,</hi> without being moved with it; but a <hi>Samaritan</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally acted the <hi>neighbour</hi> in the caſe, as the lawyer was forced to acknowledge: Jeſus ſays, <hi>Go and do thou likewiſe, Luke</hi> x. 29—37. Note by the way,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:011971_0061_0F8805C5F9C34AE0"/>he does not ſay of this branch as he does of the whole law, This do and thou ſhalt live; no, yet he expreſly ſhews, that this is binding on us all to be done, while the other is not to be left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done. This condemns all thoſe who would either abate the law to bring it down to our ability, or in the leaſt turn off its authority, and their obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion always to obey it, becauſe of their inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>However, though the attempt has often been made to juſtify ſelf by leaving God out of the queſtion, yet no rational perſon could ever entirely eraſe out of his mind an apprehenſion of a deity; therefore the common way, ever ſince man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted a diſlike to the true God, has been to make falſe ones to ſuit their own turn. When <hi>Iſrael</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected their true King, they made them <hi>Idols ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own underſtanding, Hoſ.</hi> xiii. 2, 10. and ſo it is now. Some make up a deity in their minds, ſo fond of devotion, as to accept them for good worſhipers, although they ſecretly grind the faces of the poor, and ſhut their hearts and hands againſt the needy. Others, viewing that way to be odious, frame an imagination of one who cares little for devotion, if men are but honeſt and kind to their neighbours. Though a third ſort, not chooſing to be under either of theſe reſtraints, frame a god that loves liberty, and their tongues would ſet him ſo high as not to concern himſelf with the conduct of worms, but leave them to gratify their own inclinations, provided they do but act as good fellows with each other; yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all their great <hi>ſwelling words,</hi> they make their airy deity to be ſuch an one as they ſcorn to be
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:011971_0062_0F8805C6B9C36250"/>themſelves, even ſuch a <hi>jack at a pinch,</hi> that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they find that they cannot indulge themſelves any longer here, he ſhall be ready at their call, and take them directly to Paradiſe!</p>
               <p>Oh! when will <hi>brutiſh</hi> and <hi>fooliſh</hi> man be <hi>wiſe!</hi> He that planted the ear, ſhall he not hear? He that formed the eye, ſhall he not ſee? He that chaſtiſeth the <hi>heathen,</hi> ſhall not he correct? Yes verily, for he knoweth that the <hi>thoughts</hi> of man are <hi>vanity, Pſal.</hi> xciv. 1—11.</p>
               <p>From what has been proved, I appeal to every conſcience whether the following concluſions are not certain truth.</p>
               <p n="1">I. That all the love and good behaviour that we can poſſibly have to our fellow-creatures, while our hearts are not truly united to our Creator, want the nature of true obedience, as much as the love and good order that may be in an army of rebels, wants of true obedience to their lawful Sovereign; when they are not reconciled to him.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The reaſon why all men do not judge it to be ſo, is, becauſe their <hi>underſtandings</hi> are <hi>darkened</hi> by an <hi>alienation</hi> and <hi>bias</hi> the other way, <hi>Eph.</hi> iv. 18. Therefore,</p>
               <p n="3">III. For them to ſet up their reaſon againſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine revelation, either to exclude any part of it, or to turn it aſide from its plain genuine meaning, is as criminal as it can be for a <hi>blaſed</hi> judge to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume a power to <hi>diſpenſe</hi> with any of the King's laws, or by falſe gloſſes and falſe evidences to <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert</hi> them from their juſt deſign, in order to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit the guilty, or to condemn the innocent.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. All reaſonings for an abatement of the law, or for the neglect of preſent obedience to it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:011971_0063_0F8805C779D728D0"/>of our impotency, are pleas for the worſt kind of treaſon and robbery; for God is infinitely lovely, and deſerving of all our love, worſhip and obedience, and the only reaſon why we cannot yield him all, is, becauſe we do not <hi>Like to retain him in our knowledge,</hi> but <hi>love</hi> and ſerve the <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> inſtead of the <hi>Creator;</hi> one ſetting up <hi>gain,</hi> and another his <hi>belly,</hi> in God's place, thus <hi>robbing</hi> him of his right, <hi>Rom.</hi> i. 24, 27. <hi>Tim.</hi> vi. 5. <hi>Phil.</hi> iii. 19. <hi>Matt.</hi> iii. 7—9.</p>
               <p n="5">V. All pleas againſt ſurrendering this moment to divine ſovereignty, and receiving his proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mercy in the goſpel with all our hearts, are nothing but pleas ſtill to adhere to the devil againſt the eternal God! They often ſay they cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; but the only way that they have to keep from believing, is to ſhut their eyes and ears againſt the light and evidence of <hi>truth,</hi> and to join with the prince of darkneſs and his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to try to ſet up <hi>falſhood</hi> in its ſtead. They pretend to enquire for evidence of the truth of God's <hi>promiſe,</hi> while they are <hi>willingly ignorant</hi> that all things in <hi>heaven</hi> and <hi>earth</hi> have evidenced the power and truth of his <hi>word</hi> from the beginning, and will do ſo to the <hi>day of judgment, and perdition of ungodly men,</hi> 2d <hi>Pet.</hi> iii. 4—7. All pleas for not believing the goſpel, are pleas to <hi>make God a liar,</hi> and to adhere to the <hi>father of lies</hi> inſtead of him, 1ſt <hi>John,</hi> iii. 8. and v. 10.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Therefore it is perfectly <hi>conſiſtent</hi> for him plainly to ſet life and death before all men by the miniſtry of his word, and call them all to <hi>turn and live;</hi> although he does not intend to exert his almighty power to ſave any others but
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:011971_0064_0F87CE77585D7128"/>thoſe that he has <hi>given to his Son, John</hi> vi. 37. and xvii. 2.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. To make the doctrine of God's ſecret de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees any objection or excuſe againſt a preſent and conſtant regard to his revealed will, is nothing leſs than to deny either his ability or his right to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern us; for it is eſſential to good government, to have a plan laid by the ruler, as well as rules given to the ſubject, to which each ſhould adhere in its place; and muſt not unbiaſed reaſon give in, that the more compleat the plan is, and the leſs need of alteration, the better? And ſhould you hear a perſon ſay, <q>If I thought it was not in my power to penetrate into the King's ſecrets, or to <hi>alter</hi> his counſels, I would never pretend to obey his laws,</q> would you think him to be a ſubject or a rebel! Yet what can mens objections againſt the <hi>unalterable</hi> nature of the divine decrees, mean leſs than this? It is eſſential to moral government, that laws and rules ſhould be given to men in a conditional form, enforced with the conſideration of the rewards of obedience, and puniſhments of diſobedience: And the juſt ruler will ever keep thereto in his adminiſtrations; but that is ſo far from excluding a ſecret plan, that it neceſſarily implies ſuch an one; it implies, that as far as the ruler's wiſdom and power can reach, he will be provided for all that ſhall happen, ſo as to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to do himſelf and his ſubjects juſtice, and not to be diſappointed, nor loſe his or their rights in any inſtance.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe the art of man cannot ſet the <hi>Arminian</hi> notion of grace in a fairer light than this, <hi>viz.</hi> our late King, after the moſt criminal rebels were
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:011971_0065_0F87CE7B08234850"/>executed, pardoned others, and yet put them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the trial of ſome difficult ſervice for a time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he confirmed their eſtates and privileges to them; ſo that their future welfare was <hi>ſuſpended</hi> upon their doings. But then you muſt know, that as he had neither atonement for their crimes, nor power to change their hearts, if he had par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned the chief rebels, it would have endangered the peace of the kingdom, if not his own crown, and there was reaſon for holding others in ſuſpence, becauſe he did not know their hearts, nor what their future conduct would be; and do men wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſuch a God as that! Again, law and juſtice require that each one has his due, but many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve themſelves ſo as not to be able to pay their debts, and rather than loſe all, many creditors will take up with a little part of their juſt due, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give the reſt; and ſome, in hope of future gain, will truſt the ſame perſons again. This agrees with <hi>Arminian</hi> notions. But a few years ago there was an act made which emboldened a number of vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains to launch out and get as much as they could of others eſtates into their hands, in hopes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſcued from juſtice by this pretended act of grace. This is like the <hi>Antinomians:</hi> Both of them would ſet up mercy to the injury of juſtice and truth, inſtead of meeting God at the true mercy-ſeat, where they agree and kiſs each other. Both are for keeping off, one in hopes of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding, or elſe of paying his debts with coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit money; the other to indulge himſelf as long as he can, with hopes at laſt to eſcape ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice by pleading the bankrupt-act.</p>
               <p>But let not men thus delude themſelves, our eternal King is a <hi>juſt God,</hi> as well as a <hi>Saviour, Iſa.</hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="unknown:011971_0066_0F87CE7C90DAED18"/>xlv. 21. and he will ſee that juſtice is done through the univerſe, and every ſoul ſhall be either brought to a reckoning here, and receive a clear diſcharge by our glorious ſurety, yea and <hi>quickly</hi> too; or elſe be caſt into that <hi>priſon</hi> from whence they can by <hi>no means</hi> come out till they have paid the <hi>utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt farthing, Matt.</hi> v. 25, 26. And there is not a ſinner upon earth that believes his debts to be ſo great as they are, nor that they are ſtrictly juſt, till they are brought to a fair reckoning by the ſpirit of truth; and 'tis well known, that if a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor ſhould cancel a debt, and the debtor ſtill thought that it was unjuſtly charged, he could not heartily love him for it; therefore God brings every debtor, let him owe five hundred pence, or but fifty, to know that he is juſt, and that they have <hi>nothing to pay, when</hi> he <hi>frankly forgives them, Luke</hi> vii. 42. And thoſe who are forgiven, are ſo far from deſiring to be truſted again with a ſtock in their own hands, that they durſt not truſt themſelves; they deſire ever to <hi>truſt in the Lord</hi> with all their hearts, and not ſo much as <hi>lean to their own underſtandings, Prov.</hi> iii. 5, 6.</p>
               <p>And now, kind reader, where is the abſurdity and inconſiſtency of this plan? to hold that we have deſtroyed ourſelves, and that all our help is in a ſovereign God, who of his <hi>own will</hi> begets ſouls with the <hi>word of truth,</hi> and therefore calls us to <hi>lay apart</hi> every thing that tends to hinder our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it <hi>underſtandingly</hi> and <hi>heartily,</hi> and to watch againſt the devil's arts to <hi>catch it away, Jam.</hi> i. 18—21. <hi>Matt.</hi> xiii. 19—23. And are not thoſe Satan's inſtruments, who uſe their art either to keep people from coming to hear the word, or to
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:011971_0067_0F87CE7C9C786FD8"/>arm them againſt regarding it when they do come! Surely they are, therefore beware of them, as you regard your immortal ſouls. One of their moſt artful ſnares is to inſinuate, that earneſt addreſſes to mens minds betoken pride in the ſpeaker; but though pride often operates in teachers as well as hearers, yet as it is exalting ſelf, two of its never-failing fruits are deceit and bitterneſs; a deceitful handling of the word to ſuit their own ends, and bitterneſs if they are croſſed therein, <hi>Prov.</hi> xiii. 10. <hi>Mic.</hi> iii. 5. while humility, which exalts the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and abaſes ſelf, ever produces faithfulneſs and love, and moves the preacher to renounce diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſty, and a deceitful handling of the word, and by manifeſtation of the truth to commend himſelf to every man's conſcience in the ſight of God, 2d <hi>Cor.</hi> iv. 2. But <hi>Ahab</hi> owned plainly that he <hi>hated</hi> ſuch a preacher, and would allow him no better lodgings than a <hi>priſon,</hi> nor better fare than <hi>bread</hi> and <hi>water</hi> of <hi>affliction,</hi> while he was willing deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cately to maintain four hundred flatterers, though they ſoon lead him on to ruin, 1ſt <hi>Kings,</hi> xxii. 6—35. And alas! how much is there at this day of the ſame temper in the world, that had rather maintain four hundred flatterers than one faithful dealer!</p>
               <p>The apoſtle <hi>Jude,</hi> in deſcribing thoſe who turn grace into laſciviouſneſs, ſays, Wo unto them, for they have gone in the way of <hi>Cain.</hi> who becauſe his doings were not accepted, was <hi>very wroth,</hi> and turned away to the noiſy world; after which, like <hi>Balaam,</hi> they run <hi>greedily,</hi> who counſelled <hi>Balak</hi> to lay a ſnare to draw <hi>Iſrael</hi> into ſin; and to guard againſt conviction, they, like <hi>Core,</hi> accuſe God's
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:011971_0068_0F87CE7D682A5D28"/>faithful ſervants with <hi>taking too much</hi> upon them, and with <hi>liſting up themſelves.</hi> And even in what they know naturally, as <hi>brute beaſts,</hi> they <hi>corrupt themſelves;</hi> for who ever knew a beaſt take pains to blind his eyes, that he might not ſee a pit till he got into it! Who ever knew a bird labour hard to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>! Yet ſuch is theſe mens conduct! <hi>Prov.</hi> i. 17. 18 <hi>Jude</hi> x. 11.</p>
               <p>To conclude, ſince precept and promiſe are united and ever go together in the goſpel plan, in vain do men attempt to ſeparate them: Every ſoul that truly believes the goſpel, has with <hi>Jacob</hi> got what God <hi>has ſaid,</hi> both to direct his conduct and to ſupport him therein; and as truth declares, that <hi>If any man will do, he ſhall know, John</hi> vii. 17. therefore all the attempts that are made by thoſe who would be accounted believers, to excuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from openly profeſſing Chriſt, or to excuſe their neglect of a faithful diſcharge of the duties of a member of his church, either from the plea of ignorance or inability, are nothing better than attempts to juſtify ſelf, at the expence of God's honour! For as ſurely as he is true, he will never fail both to direct and ſupport every one who truſts in him, and is willing to obey him. Then let none deceive themſelves with the notion of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaints, if their hearts and lives are not govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſupported by truth; and if we are ſo, it will move us to a conſcientious uſe of all the means which God has appointed, both of a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic and private nature, to learn, and to promote truth in the world, and to avoid and watch againſt all that is contrary thereto.</p>

            </head>
            <p>IT is a juſt obſervation of an excellent writer, that ancient cuſtom and modern faſhion are two tyrants, which ſhare the empire of the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; the truth of which often appears, both in civil and religious affairs. The name of the <hi>good old way,</hi> ſeems enough to prejudice many againſt the leaſt variation from the cuſtoms of their fathers, and ſo againſt reformation; while others are ſo fond of novelties, as to be eaſily carried about with <hi>every wind of doctrine,</hi> that comes under a new and ſpecious name, with exclamations againſt old <hi>traditions.</hi> And though believers will regard the truth when they find it, for its own ſake, yet it adds to their comfort to meet with others who know the ſame, which comfort is increaſed when they can commune with thoſe who have lived long before them: Therefore having lately met with ſome things concerning the fathers of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which may ſerve to confirm the foregoing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and alſo to correct the miſtakes of many, both in our denomination, and that are oppoſite thereto, who imagine that this doctrine was in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient days peculiar to the Pedobaptiſts, I think it proper to inſert a ſketch thereof here.</p>

The oldeſt Baptiſt church in this land is at <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> which was planted under the conduct of Mr. <hi>Roger Williams;</hi> and we may well conclude, that thoſe who followed him into the great dangers and hardſhips of his exile, had a good liking to the doctrines which he taught, and what they were we may gather from the various accounts we have of him.</p>
            <p>He came firſt to this country on <hi>February</hi> 5, 1631, being in his youth, and he preached a while at <hi>Salem,</hi> but the Court of Aſſiſtants at <hi>Boſton</hi> wrote to that church againſt him the 12th of <hi>April</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, which prevented their calling him to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice then, and he went to <hi>Plymouth,</hi> where he preached about three years; and Governor <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throp,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wilſon,</hi> of <hi>Boſton,</hi> upon a viſit there, communed with him at the Lord's ſupper, on <hi>October</hi> 28, 1632<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Prince</hi>'s Annals, vol. 2. p. 26, 47, 70.</note>.

And though to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify or excuſe the ſeverity that was uſed againſt him, a great deal has been written to render him odious and ridiculous, yet Dr. <hi>Mather,</hi> after much of that nature, ſays, <q>It was more than forty years after his exile that he lived here (at <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>) and in many things acquitted himſelf ſo
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:011971_0071_0F87CE80CA737DC8"/>laudably, that many judicious perſons judged him to have had the <hi>root of the matter</hi> in him.—He uſed many commendable endeavours to chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ize the <hi>Indians</hi> in his neighbourhood, of whoſe language, tempers and manners, he has printed a little relation.—There was alſo a good correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence always held between him and many worthy and pious people in the colony from whence he had been baniſhed.—Againſt the Quakers, he afterward maintained the main principles of the <hi>Proteſtant religion</hi> with much vigour<note n="*" place="bottom">Magnalia, b. 3. p. 9.</note>

            <p>The ſecond Baptiſt church in <hi>New-England</hi> was gathered at <hi>Newport,</hi> under the care of Mr. <hi>John Clark,</hi> about the year 1644; and what their faith was you may ſee a little of in the following ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts: <q>The decree of God is that whereby God hath from eternity ſet down with himſelf what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall come to paſs in time, <hi>Eph.</hi> i. 11.

               <q>Having found in the hands of brother <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Smith</hi> a ſmall book, written by Mr. <hi>John Clark,</hi> the firſt paſtor of this church, containing his judgment, and the judgment of the church, reſpecting that ſoul-ſupporting doctrine of <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:011971_0076_0F87CE841D24DC78"/>election,</hi> which is at this day ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned; for the eſtabliſhing the church under its preſent conſtitution in this glorious truth, I think it not improper to tranſcribe it, this 31ſt day of <hi>July,</hi> 1727.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here note, theſe were both the ſentiments of Mr. <hi>Clark</hi> and of his church, of which he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued the paſtor till his death, which happened on <hi>April</hi> 20, 1675; only as his ſufferings in the <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts</hi> occaſioned his going to <hi>England,</hi> where he procured the preſent <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> charter.</p>
            <p>Therefore ſince Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> who procured their firſt charter from the Parliament, and Mr. <hi>Clark,</hi> who obtained their preſent charter from the King, and the two firſt churches in the colony, were ſo full in this doctrine of ſovereign grace, how illy does it become any inhabitant of that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony now to exclaim againſt the doctrine as an old notion of other ſects, but as what was new among them? And how unjuſt has it been in many others, to repreſent the contrary doctrine as peculiarly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Baptiſts<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Callender</hi> informs us, that the doctrine of <hi>free will</hi> and <hi>laying on of hands</hi> cauſed a ſeparation in the church at <hi>Newport,</hi> about the ſame time of that at <hi>Providence,</hi> Century ſermon, p. 65. And Governor <hi>Joſeph Jenches,</hi> ſpeaking in a letter to a friend, dated <hi>March</hi> 19, 1730, of the opinion that laying on of hands ought not to be any bar of communion with thoſe who have been rightly baptized, ſays, <q>I have been informed by one, or more, of the ancient members of our church at <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> that ſuch was the opinion of the Baptiſts in he firſt conſtitution of their churches throughout this colony.</q>
               </note>?</p>
            <p>For as that was not the caſe in the two firſt of their churches in this country, ſo neither was it with the third, which is the firſt in the <hi>Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts</hi> province, namely that of <hi>Swanzey.</hi> I find by
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:011971_0077_0F87CE84E03A1B58"/>the records of that church, that it was conſtituted in the year 1649. at <hi>Ilſton,</hi> in <hi>Glamorganſhire, South-Wales,</hi> where it proſpered under the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of Mr. <hi>John Miles,</hi> till he was ejected from thence by the act of uniformity, which turned ſo many godly men out of their places in 1662<note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Calamy</hi>'s account of ejected miniſters, vol. 2. p. 731.</note>; after which, he and a conſiderable part of his church came over and ſettled at <hi>Swanzey,</hi> which was then in <hi>Plymouth</hi> colony, who were more moderate towards diſſenters than ſome were; hence in Dr. <hi>Mather</hi>'s account of that colony he ſays, <q>There has been among them one church, that queſtioned and omitted the uſe of infant baptiſm; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, there being many good men among thoſe of that perſuaſion, I do not know that they have been <hi>perſecuted,</hi> with any harder means, than thoſe of kind conferences to reclaim them<note n="‖" place="bottom">Magnalia, b. 1. p. 14.</note>.</q> And ſpeaking of miniſters that he could not tell how to put among their <hi>worthies,</hi> he ſays, <q>I confeſs, there were ſome of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whoſe names deſerve to live in our book for their <hi>piety,</hi> although their peculiar opinions were ſuch, as to be diſſerviceable unto the declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſuppoſed intereſts of our churches. Of theſe there were ſome godly Annabaptiſts; as namely, Mr. <hi>Hanſard Knollys,</hi> of <hi>Dover,</hi> who afterwards removing back to <hi>London,</hi> died there, <hi>a good man, in a good old age.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Miles,</hi> of <hi>Swanzey,</hi> who afterwards came to <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi>

               </q> Once more, as Mr. <hi>Clark</hi> and his church held election to be God's chooſing ſome men TO faith, holineſs, and eternal life, for the praiſe of his glorious mercy, and that, <q>The cauſe which moved the Lord to elect them who are choſen, was <hi>none other</hi> but his meer good will and pleaſure,</q> which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutes in the <hi>ſame order</hi> in time; and as Mr. <hi>Comer</hi> calls this a <hi>glorious truth,</hi> and a <hi>ſoul-ſupporting</hi> doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine; ſo his preaching this goſpel at <hi>Reboboth,</hi> in the year 1731, was the powerful means of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting many ſouls, whom Mr. <hi>Comer</hi> baptized, and ſo gathered the firſt Baptiſt church there, of which the late Elder <hi>Richard Round</hi> was one, who with others held this doctrine to the laſt. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as I think I have proved that Mr. <hi>Martin,</hi> (who belongs to another ſociety in that town) has acted againſt ſcripture and reaſon, in denying this doctrine; ſo he alſo has againſt the teſtimony of his pious fathers; yea I may add, of his fathers in the other <hi>England</hi> as well as this; for the firſt confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of faith which was publiſhed by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Baptiſts, was publiſhed by ſeven churches in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
