            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AS there is great Variety in the inclinations of Men in general, ſo 'tis particularly remarkable in thoſe who addict themſelves to the Studies of Nature and Humane Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature: For ſome with great Eagerneſs enquire into the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Nature, and the Natural Cauſes of Things; ſome endeavour to dig up Antiquities from the Dark, by ſearching out the Signification of Statues and Inſcriptions of Antique Stones, and old and almoſt worn out Medals; and others pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſe with unwearied Diligence the Hiſtories both of Modern and Ancient Times, and not without good Cauſe: For Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory is not unjuſtly called the Looking glaſs of humane Life; not only becauſe it ſheweth unto us Matters of Fact which are either commendable, or reproveable, and we behold therein that which is paſt, as if it were preſent; but alſo becauſe from Things which have already happened we may learn what is beſt for us to do, and what we ought to avoid. And therefore great Benefit may be reaped from the Reading of Hiſtories, beſides the Pleaſure which the Variety of Tranſactions affords to our Senſes, when Matters are accompanied with ſingular Circumſtances and unexpected Events.</p>
            <p>NOW ſince the Reading of Hiſtorical Treatiſes was one of the moſt pleaſant Diverſions of my Youth, this drew me; when I attained to ſome Maturity of Age, to enquire after many Things that had happened in thy Kingdoms and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, which by many were almoſt forgotten. And having ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered great Store of very remarkable Caſes, which I thought worthy to be kept upon Record; and not buried in Oblivion, I was induced to compoſe an Hiſtory, which for the rare Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, and unuſual Matter contained therein, I believe are not eaſily parallell'd.</p>
            <p>AND after a long and difficult Labour, having at length finiſhed the Work ſo far as to expoſe it to publick View; and then thinking to whom I ſhould dedicate it, it preſently came
<pb facs="unknown:003104_0003_0FEFF324B303F790"/>
into my Mind, that this could not be done more ſuitably to any than to the King of theſe Countries, which are the chie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Theatre of this Hiſtory; and the rather, becauſe therein is de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſcribed the Riſe of a People, who are no ſmall Part of his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Subjects: For ſo I may ſafely call them, ſince they never (how much ſoever wrong'd and oppreſs'd) offer'd any Reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the Government: And when for Conſcience ſake they could not comply with what was required of them, by patient Suffering they ſhewed their Subjection and Obedience to the higher Power. Nay, when Opportunity was offer'd to revenge themſelves; of their Enemies, even then they would not, but left it to the Lord; and thus at all Times they behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves like a peaceable People.</p>
            <p>AND ſince I have alſo had Occaſion in this Hiſtory to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſome Illuſtrious Branches of thy Royal Family, to whom could I then with more Juſtice offer this Work, than to Thee, O King of <hi>Great Britain!</hi> Who, having already made thy ſelf gloriouſly renowned by thy eminent Clemency beſtowed even upon ſuch who by their unnatural Rebellion had forfeited it, didſt rather chooſe to eſtabliſh thy Throne thereby, than by Severity, and thus effectually to obſerve this Leſſon of the wiſeſt of Kings,<note place="margin">Prov. xx. 28.</note> 
               <hi>Mercy and Truth preſerve the King, and his Throne is upholden by Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ALL this hath emboldened me, GREAT KING, to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate this Work to Thee with due Regard, and in a Way of hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Addreſs to approach thy Royal Preſence. Be pleaſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, according to thy wonted Goodneſs, to excuſe this modeſt Freedom, and to know, that tho' it be offered by a Foreigner, yet it proceeds from him who heartily wiſheth that God may Vouchſafe Thee long to reign in Peace and Tranquility over thy Subjects; and when removed hence from an earthly and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Diadem, to grant Thee an heavenly and incorruptible Crown of Glory.

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AFTER a Labour of more them five and twenty Years, this Hiſtory at length appears in publick View; to the compiling of which I was induced from the Conſideration that the Riſe and Encreaſe of that Religious Society, which in this Work I have given a circumſtantial Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of, is indeed ſo rare and wonderful a Thing, that I think few will be met with in Modern Hiſtories, which in the like Reſpect may be compared therewith; becauſe the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſo called are become a great People, under ſuch heavy Oppreſſion as is herein after-mentioned; and that not by any human Power, or making Reſiſtance, but meerly by an harmleſs Deportment, and the exerciſing of Patience; for the bearing of Arms, and the reſiſting of the Wicked by Fighting, they always have counted unlawful, and contrary to the Doctrine of our Saviour. Thus they who had no King, Prince nor Potentate to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect them, and who in the Beginning had not among themſelves any Men of Renown or Literature; but relying on their Integrity, and truſting to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, have at length triumphed over the Malice of their Oppoſers, by ſuffering, (which roſe to that Degree, that it was at the Expence of the Lives of many of them) and under violent Oppreſſion from High and Low, and the Oppoſition of Learned and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlearned.</p>
            <p>ALL this having been ſearched after, and found out by aſſiduous Diligence it appeared ſo wonderful to me, that I reſolved to give a Relation thereof, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the great Labour I ſoon perceived this Work required. To this may be added, that when I conſider'd that ſeveral Authors, both <hi>Germans</hi> and others, had publiſhed Books and Accounts of this People, ſtuft with groſs <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths, I was the more ſpurr'd on thereby to ſet down in due Order, for my Countrymens Sake, what I knew of the Matter; for it ſeems indeed to be of ſmall Advantage, that when any Thing is well known to us, we keep that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge only to our ſelves,<note n="*" place="bottom">Scire tuam nihil e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>NOW how difficult ſoever I found this Labour, yet having made a Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, I reſolved to go on; and ſo I did, tho' often ſtopt by ſeveral Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and alſo other Work: For during this Labour, I have not only tranſlated ſeveral bulky Books into <hi>Dutch,</hi> beſides <hi>Kennet's Antiquities of Rome,</hi> but alſo compoſed ſeveral Treatiſes of Moment, and among theſe my <hi>Great Dictionary Engliſh and Low Dutch.</hi> And notwithſtanding all theſe Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments, I continually reſumed this Work by Intervals ſo often, that I have written it almoſt thrice to make it compleat: For doubting of ſome Things, and finding others defective, it made me write to <hi>England</hi> for better Information; which having gotten at length after much Pains and long Waiting, I was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Times obliged to lay aſide Part of my former Deſcription, and make a new one; which happen'd ſo often, that had I not been ſupported by an unweari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Application, the Difficulty of the Labour, which hath been much greater in <hi>Holland</hi> than if I had compoſed the Work in <hi>England,</hi> would have made me give it over. But I went on, and ſo finiſh'd this Hiſtory in that Form as it now appears.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:003104_0005_0FEFF32A272F43E8"/>AND I am not without Thoughts, that I was prepared to be inſtrumental for ſuch a Work as this: For ſeveral remarkable Things I have made <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of, I noted down before ever I thought of compoſing ſuch a Hiſtory; and even is my young Years, when I was in <hi>England,</hi> I copied out from Manuſcripts ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Pieces and Letters, which are inſerted in this Hiſtory, it may be hardly to be found elſewhere.</p>
            <p>AT the firſt Sight perhaps ſome will be ready to think that I might have ſuperſeded this Labour; ſince the learned World hath long ago ſeen a Book written in <hi>Latin</hi> by <hi>Gerard Croeſe,</hi> with the Title of <hi>Hiſtoria Quake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana.</hi> But be it known to the Reader, that tho' the Author got the chief Contents thereof from me, yet that Relation which he gives of the Riſe and Progreſs of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> is very imperfect and defective; and that he preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to relate Things of which he had no true Knowledge. I gave him indeed many Things in Writing; but not all I had collected; beſides having ſince that Time written to my Acquaintance in <hi>England,</hi> I got Narratives of many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Occurrences given forth in Print there, and many Authentick Pieces in Manuſcript. Now tho' this Collection was, as <hi>Ovid</hi> calleth the Chaos, <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis indigeſtaque Moles,</hi> [a rude and undigeſted Heap;] yet from thence, and from my own Collection of Matters known to me, I have compiled the greateſt Part of this Hiſtory: But as to the Life and Tranſactions of <hi>G. Fox,</hi> who is largely treated of in this Work, I took them chiefly from his Journal: And the greateſt Part of other Occurrences, or the Lives and Tranſactions of others, I have taken from the Works of deceaſed Authors, and out of Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of ſmall Books publiſhed in Print not long after the Things happened, and not contradicted by whatever I could learn.</p>
            <p>TH<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S I have endeavoured to aſſert nothing but what I had good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority for; which in regard of ſome Circumſtances, would have been yet far more difficult after the Expiration of ſome Years: For now Time gave Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to be informed of many Things, which ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ancient People had yet Remembrance of, and which after their Deceaſe perhaps ſhould have been bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in Oblivion.</p>
            <p>I CAN'T well omit here publickly to acknowledge the ſignal Kindneſs and Diligence of my well-beloved and much eſteemed Friend <hi>Theodore Eccleſton</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> who hath furniſhed me with Abundance of Materials, not only very uſeful, but alſo abſolutely neceſſary for the compiling of this Work: From him I had Intelligence on that Account, and have exchanged a Multitude of Letters. And thus by a long continued Correſpondence I came to be acquainted with many Things and Circumſtances, which after ſome Years might have been more difficult to obtain.</p>
            <p>ADD to this, that I have deſcribed ſeveral Things well known to me, which few beſides my ſelf within theſe thirty or forty Years had better Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of. I have alſo mentioned ſeveral remarkable Caſes, which I noted down from the Mouths of credible Perſons, who have been dead many Years ago; and thought not that at any Time I ſhould have publiſhed them in Print. In the mean while I took Account of what ſeemed to me worthy to be left upon Record; and I collected a great Quantity of Books, wherein many Occurrences, mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this <hi>Hiſtory</hi> were related. Of ſuch Kind of Relations and Accounts I have made <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe, without taking from thence all that was remarkable: For it hath not been for Want of Matter that this <hi>Hiſtory</hi> hath not run out far her, ſince I could have made it thrice as big, if I had been minded ſo to do. But as I was unwilling to extend my Work any further than my Strength and Fealth in all Probability ſhould permit, ſo I would not glut my Reader with many
<pb facs="unknown:003104_0006_0FEFF2E61D2DECC8"/>
Things of one and the ſame Nature; but have endeavoured by Variety of Matter, to quicken his Appetite; and therefore have intermixt the ſerious Part ſometimes with a facetious Accident.</p>
            <p>YET I have not thought my ſelf bound to take Notice of every odd Caſe that may have happened among the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſo called: For there have converſed among them ſuch, who acted ſome particular Things that were not approved of by thoſe of that Society. And if any one ſwayed by human Paſſion commits any Exceſs, which is diſapproved of by his Fellow-Members of the Church, ſuch an Act may not be duly imputed to the People he makes Profeſſion with. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſuch Particulars may be reckon'd the Caſe of one <hi>Heſter Biddle,</hi> which <hi>Croeſe</hi> makes mention of, about the End of his Hiſtory: For tho' it was told him from the Relation ſhe gave of it at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> not with any Intention that he ſhould publiſh it, yet this was a particular Caſe which ſhe her ſelf muſt be reſponſible for; ſince Experience hath taught that Imagination ſometimes works ſo powerfully on the Mind, that one thinks himſelf obliged to do a Thing which were better left undone.</p>
            <p>YET for all that it is true, that Men fearing God, may miſtake, and thro' Ignorance do ſomething, which others not without Reaſon might judge not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable. Alſo it may happen that ſome again from a godly Fear have act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or omitted what others, no leſs pious, would not have ſcrupled. And tho' ſome among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> in the Beginning of their Riſe, for Fear of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing Chriſt's Command,<note place="margin">Matt. xxviii. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Be not ye called Rabbi, for one is your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, even Chriſt,</hi> ſpeaking to Perſons in Authority, called them by the Name of <hi>Friend;</hi> yet others of the ſame Perſuaſion have not therefore thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bound to refuſe to Magiſtrates their diſtinguiſhing Titles of Magiſtracy. Nay, if any for ſome ſpecial Reaſon may not have given a full or direct An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to a Query, yet others of the ſame Society have not look'd upon this as a Pattern to imitate. For the moſt eminent Valiants among this People in the Beginning were not Men of Note or Learning, tho' of great Courage, inſomuch that their immoveable Stedfaſtneſs ſometimes ſo exaſperated their Enemies, that their Fear of doing or omitting any Thing which they judged would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe God, often hath been ſtampt with the odious Denomination of Stubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Stiffneckedneſs; but they have born this patiently, believing that it was their Duty to perſevere immoveably in minding their Chriſtian Profeſſion, and in frequenting their religious Aſſemblies. And that ſuch a Stedfaſtneſs was the Duty of a Chriſtian, ſeems alſo to have been the Judgment of the Authors of the <hi>Confeſſion of Faith of the reformed Churches in the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands, Art. xxviii.</hi> where it is ſaid, <hi>That it is the Office or Duty of all Believers, to ſeparate themſelves according to the Word of God from thoſe that are not of the Church; and to joyn to this Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, in what Place ſoever God hath placed them, tho' the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and Edicts of Princes were againſt it, and that Death, or any corporal Puniſhment was annex'd to it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is true, there have been ſuch among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> who were exceeding bold in repreſenting to their Enemies their evil Behaviour and Deportment: But this hath been a peculiar Talent of pious Men, of whom Examples was extant in the Books of Martyrs, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſome of them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> very plain Terms told their Perſecutors of their Wickedneſs. Very remarkable in that Reſpect, is the Speech of <hi>John Molleus,</hi> who about the Year 1653, being Priſoner at <hi>Rome,</hi> without any Diſſimulation, expoſed to publick View the wicked Lives of the Cardinals and Biſhops, who were ordered by the Pope to examime him. The like Boldneſs appears alſo in the Letter of <hi>Hans van Hoven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> to the Magiſtrates of <hi>Ghem</hi> in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>

<pb facs="unknown:003104_0007_0FEFF32C9CD3EDB8"/>
               <hi>Mirror of Martyrs of the Baptiſts.</hi> From whence it appears, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> have not been the only People, who have told their Perſecutors very boldly of their wicked Deportment and Cruelty.</p>
            <p>IT can't be denied that there have been at Times, among the Society, ſome People of an odd Behaviour, who in Proceſs of Time embraced ſtrange Opinions and perverſe Notions: But that's no new Thing; ſince this hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened alſo among thoſe of other Perſuaſions, tho' none of theſe would allow that this was the Conſequence or Effect of their Doctrine. We find in Sacred Writ, that even in the Primitive Chriſtian Church there were Apoſtates, either ſuch as maintained ſtrange Doctrine, as the <hi>Nicolaitanes,</hi> or ſuch who finding the ſtrait Way too narrow for them, left it, and like <hi>Demas,</hi> falling in Love again with the World, entred into the broad Way. And therefore it can now no more than then, be argued from thence, that the Exorbitances to which ſome launched out, were the Effects of the Doctrine they forſook.</p>
            <p>SINCE in this Hiſtory ſome Predictions are alſo mention'd, and that ſome byaſſed by Prejudice, will perhaps look upon them as frivolous, imagining that the <hi>Quakers</hi> pretend to have the Spirit of Prophecy; I'll anſwer to this, That tho' among Thouſands of them there may have been One that prophetically foretold a Thing, which afterwards truly happened; yet others of that Society preſumed to have that Gift, no more than to have that of being a Preacher: And all are not called to that Work. There muſt be Anteceſſors and Leaders in the religious Oeconomy, as well as in the Politick State: For if every one not qualified ſhould aſſume the Office of Governing, Things would ſoon run into Confuſion. Now tho' ſome have had this falſe Conceit, that to be able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict future Things was a Quality the <hi>Quakers</hi> attributed to themſelves, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from their Doctrine, that Chriſtians ought to be led by the Spirit of God; yet this is a very ſiniſter and prepoſterous Conceit: For what they ſay concerning the Leading and Guiding of the Spirit of God, is agreeable with the Doctrine of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Rom. viii. 14.</note> who ſaith, <hi>As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God.</hi> And this was alſo the Doctrine of the firſt Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. What muſt we think then of thoſe who will not be led by this Spirit, but call this Doctrine by the odious Denomination of Enthuſiaſm? The ſame Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle tells us alſo,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <hi>If any have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his.</hi> And he alſo ſaith,<note place="margin">1 Cor. xli. 7.</note> 
               <hi>The Manifeſtation of the Spirit is given to every Man to profit withal.</hi> But from thence it doth in no wiſe follow, that the Spirit of Prophecy is given to every one; neither that altho' it might pleaſe God to reveal to One a Thing which was yet to come, ſuch an One therefore was endued with a Prophetical Spirit, that he was able at any Time, to predict future Things.</p>
            <p>IF this Poſition be true, then thoſe of other Perſuaſions might alſo lay Claim to that Prerogative; becauſe among them ſometimes there have been pious Men, who predicted remarkable Things, which afterwards really happened; as amongſt the reſt, <hi>James Uſher</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> and Primate of <hi>Ireland;</hi> who foretold the Rebellion in <hi>Ireland</hi> Forty Years before it came to paſs; beſides the inteſtine War and Miſeries that befel <hi>England,</hi> and other Things that were fulfilled; which leads us not to reject as frivolous his Predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the dreadful Perſecution that would fall upon all the Proteſtant Churches by the <hi>Papiſts:</hi> For tho' one of his Friends once objected to him, That ſince <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> had already ſuffered ſo deeply, there was Reaſon to hope that the Judgments of God in reſpect of theſe Kingdoms might have been paſt; yet he replied to it, <hi>Fool not your ſelves with ſuch Hopes; for I tell you, all you have yet ſeen hath been but the Beginning of Sorrows to what is yet to come upon the Proteſtant Churches of
<pb facs="unknown:003104_0008_0FEFF2E938519270"/>
Chriſt, who will ere long fall under a ſharper Perſecution than ever yet hath been upon them. And therefore look you be not found in the outward Court, but a Worſhipper in the Temple before the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar: For Chriſt will meaſure all thoſe that profeſs his Name, and call themſelves his People; and the outward Worſhippers he will leave out, to be trodden down by the</hi> Gentiles. <hi>The outward Court is the formal Chriſtian, whoſe Religion lies in performing the Outſide Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ot Chriſtianity, without having an inward Life and Power of Faith and Love uniting them to Chriſt: And theſe God will leave to be trodden down, and ſwept away by the</hi> Gentiles. <hi>But the Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers within the Temple, and before the Altar, are thoſe who do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed worſhip God in Spirit and in Truth, whoſe Souls are made his Temples, and he is honoured and adored in the moſt inward Thoughts of their Hearts, and they ſacrifice their Luſts and vile Affections, yea, and their own Wills to him: And theſe God will hide in the Hollow of his Hand, and under the Shadow of his Wings. And this ſhall be the great Difference between this laſt, and all the other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Perſecutions: For in the former, the moſt eminent and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Miniſters and Chriſtians did generally ſuffer moſt, and were moſt violently fallen upon; but in this laſt Perſecution theſe ſhall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by God as a Seed to partake of that Glory which ſhall imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately follow, and come upon the Church, as ſoon as ever this Storm ſhall be over: For as it ſhall be the ſharpeſt, ſo it ſhall be the ſhorteſt Perſecution of them all, and ſhall only take away the groſs Hypocrites and formal Profeſſors; but the true Spiritual Believers ſhall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved till the Calamity be over-paſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF any now a-days ſhould ſpeak at this Rate, it's credible, that many who think themſelves to be good Chriſtians, would decry this as meer Enthuſiaſm. But the ſaid Biſhop is ſtill in ſuch great Repute with the Learned, and hath obtained ſuch an high Eſteem by his Writings, that his Words are likely to be of more Weight with many, than thoſe of other pious Men. And therefore I was willing to renew them, and revive his Memory, if perhaps this might make form Impreſſion upon the Minds of any: For this is a certain Truth, that no outward Performances will avail any, if they do not worſhip God in Spirit and in Truth; for ſuch Worſhippers God ſeeks, according to what our Saviour himſelf ſaid:<note place="margin">Mat. vii. 21, 22, 23.</note> Beſides, that <hi>Not every one that ſaith to</hi> him, <hi>Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> Nay, when many in that Day will ſay to him, <hi>Lord, Have we not propheſied in thy Name?</hi> He will ſay to them, <hi>I never knew you; Depart from me ye that work Iniquity.</hi>

            <p>AS the many ſingular Caſes related in this Hiſtory will afford no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing Entertainment to curious Readers, ſo they will be found alſo inſtructive; for we ſhall not only meet with Inſtances of true Piety and Love to one's Neighbour, and of Saints triumphing on their Death-beds, and alſo with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Examples of Sinners truly penitent at the Hour of Death: but we may alſo find here Abundance of Proofs of a peaceable Behaviour: For the <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſo called, have not plotted againſt the Government, nor meddled with treaſonable Practices or Rebellions: And how much ſoever they were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, yet they always were quiet, and never made any Reſiſtance, but with an harmleſs Patience they have born their moſt heavy Oppreſſions and Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and ſo it length overcame: For to be ſubject to Magiſtracy hath always been one of their Principles; and that they were really dutiful Subjects, they have ſhewed at all Times, by paying Obedience to the Higher Power, in all they could do with a good Conſcience. And when any Thing was required of them, which from a reverential Reſpect to God they durſt not do, or omit,
<pb facs="unknown:003104_0009_0FEFF32EF1AFBA00"/>
they have ſhewed their Obedience by ſuffering, without making any Reſiſtance, or joining with others who were inclined thereto.</p>

That he approved the Contents of the Book I know; but I know alſo that it never proceeded from his Pen. And many Years afterwards it was publiſhed under the Name of one <hi>Peter Balling</hi> as the Author, tho' there were thoſe who father'd it upon <hi>Adam Boreel,</hi> becauſe it is found print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Latin</hi> among his <hi>Scripta Poſthuma.</hi> And this Opinion it not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther improbable; for among his Works are found alſo ſome other Writings, that contain ſeveral Poſitions aſſerted by the <hi>Quakers:</hi> Beſides, he and ſome other of the Collegians, and among th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now if we preſuppoſe that <hi>Adam Boreel</hi> was the Author of the ſaid <hi>Latin</hi> Book, <hi>Peter Balling</hi> might be the Tranſlator thereof into <hi>Dutch;</hi> for that it was originally written in <hi>Latin,</hi> ſeems to me very probable.</p>
            <p>B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T however this be, it appears plainly, that the Author would not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly be known, for the Title ſeemed deſignedly compoſed ſo, that the Readers ſhould believe <hi>W. Ames</hi> to be the Author of it, <hi>viz. The Light on the Candleſtick, ſerving for Illuſtration of the Principal Matters in the Book called,</hi> The Myſteries of the Kingdom of God, &amp;c. <hi>againſt</hi> Galenus Abrahamſon, <hi>and his Aſſenters, treated of, and written by</hi> W. Ames. And this Name ſtood in Capital Letters underneath, in ſuch a Manner as the Name of an Author is uſually placed upon a Title tho' the Publiſher meant no more, but that <hi>W. Ames</hi> was the Author of the Book called, <hi>The Myſteries of the Kingdom of God.</hi> And there was no Printer's Name added to it, but only, <hi>Printed for the Author,</hi> 1662.</p>
            <p>NOW tho' I can't tell certainly who was the Author, yet I have thought fit, ſince the ſaid Book is not eaſily to be got in <hi>Latin,</hi> to inſert it in the Appendix of this Hiſtory; from whence it may appear, as well as from the Writings of ſome others, that there have been ſuch as either commended the <hi>Quakers,</hi> or defended their Doctrine, tho' they themſelves never could reſolve to joyn with them publickly.</p>
            <p>B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T notwithſtanding all this, there have been others, who to render the Doctrine, the Deportment, and Carriage of the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſuſpected and odious, have been ready to repreſent their honeſt Behaviour and religious Life as Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſaical Righteouſneſs; altho' Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſo earneſtly recommended ſuch a Life.<note place="margin">v. 18.</note> Pray what mean theſe Words of our Saviour, <hi>Be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T tho' the <hi>Quakers</hi> have endeavoured to make their Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation agree with their Chriſtian Profeſſion, yet this hath raiſed Envy, Grudge and Malice againſt them: And among the Clergy there have been ſuch, who to render them odious, did not ſtick to repreſent them as diſguiſed Papiſts, notwithſtanding theſe were none of their meaneſt Enemies. For, after a due Reflection and Conſideration, it hath ſeemed to me, that when King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second was on the Throne, the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> and ſuch among the <hi>Church of England</hi> as favoured them, were the cheif Promoters of Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And theſe, to purſue their wicked Ends, would not proceed according to Law, in the Trials of impriſoned <hi>Quakers;</hi> but they continually ſtrove to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce an arbitrary Power; and ſo, from Time to Time, they did not omit to proſecute the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſeverely, thinking that when they were once ſuppreſſed, the other Diſſenters muſt fall of Neceſſity, tho' they were not for Non-Reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. But Providence acted very remarkably; for when a Popiſh Prince af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards would introduce Liberty of Conſcience, the Eyes of the moſt moderate Maintainers of the <hi>Church of England</hi> came to be ſo opened, that in the Reign of King <hi>William III.</hi> they promoted a general Liberty of Conſcience, by which the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> at length obtained Liberty to perform their publick Worſhip without Moleſtation.</p>
            <p>TH<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S far the Limits of this Hiſtory are extended; and being arrived there, I did not think my ſelf bound to enlarge any farther; what follows be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more than an Overplus.</p>
            <p>I HAVE related nothing in this Work, but what I believed to be unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionably true: For what ſeemed doubtful to me I rather chooſe to paſs by, having never been of ſo credulous a Temper, as eaſily to take Things on Truſt without due Examination: For we often ſee that high-ſoaring Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions make People believe Things that are far from being true. But for all that, we ought not to reject as untrue every Thing that appears ſtrange or unuſual; ſince Experience convinceth us of the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſometimes we have ſeen a Thing, which if we had not beheld with our own Eyes, we could hardly have believed. Wherefore I would not reject as untrue what was extraordinary or unuſual, when it was told me by credible Perſons, or confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Eye-Witneſſes. And therefore, tho' my Reader may meet with ſome very ſingular Occurrences, yet this is true, that I have endeavoured to the utmoſt to relate nothing, but what after a nice Enquiry ſeemed to me to be true, or at leaſt very probable. And yet I have ſilently paſs'd over ſome Caſes which I did not queſtion to be true, leſt any might think me too credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</p>

            <p>FOR my Stile, I know it is but indifferent: I do not pretend to Elegancy in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue; for being a Foreigner, and never having been in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> but about the Space of ten Months, and that near Fifty Years ago, it ought not to be expected that I ſhould write <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſo well as <hi>Dutch,</hi> my Native Language. If therefore my Pen ſometimes hath been guilty of a Belgiciſm, I beg Excuſe of my Reader. And ſince my Abſence hath hindred me from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the Printer's Miſtakes, either in Omiſſions or other Errors, ſuch Faults I don't think my ſelf reſponſible for, becauſe I have been fain to truſt the Overſight and Correction of my Work to others, who may have been more lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to let Errors eſcape, than my ſelf ſhould have been.

            <p>THAT the marvelous Work of <hi>Reformation</hi> hath been ſmall and of very little Eſteem in its Beginning,<note place="margin">1415</note> and yet been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd with remarkable Progreſs, will, I believe, be deny'd by none, that have read with Attention and a due Conſideration the Hiſtory of its firſt Riſe; ſince God, the Beginner and Author of this glorious Work, proceeding by Steps and Degrees, hath uſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſuch ſingular Wiſdom and Prudence, that, (every Circumſtance du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider'd) inſtead of cenſuring any Part thereof, they will be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to cry out <hi>Thou, O Lord, alone knoweſt the right Times and Seaſons to open the Eyes of People, and to make them capable of thy Truth!</hi> For if we look to the firſt Beginnings,<note place="margin">J.Hus</note> to go back no farther than <hi>John Hus,</hi> we ſhall find, that tho in many Things he was conſiderably enlightned, yet he remain'd ſtill in ſeveral groſs Errors; for altho' he had a clear Sight of the vain Doctrines of Purgatory, Praying to, and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of Images, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nevertheleſs it is reported of him, that he fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd the Invocation of Saints, the Seven Sacraments, Auricular Confeſſion, and other Tenets of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and yet Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Charity conſtrains us to believe (tho' we find Proteſtant Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters who deny him the Name of a Martyr) that by his Death, which he ſuffer d in the Flames at <hi>Conſtance</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> on the Sixth of the Month call'd <hi>July,</hi> in the Year 1415, he hath been an acceptable Sacrifice unto God: And with what a ſedate and well compos'd Mind he ſuffer'd Death, may be concluded from this, That he ſeeing a Country-Fellow very zealouſly carrying Wood to burn him, ſaid, with a ſmiling Countenance, <hi>O holy Simplicity!</hi> and that after the Fire was kindled, he ſang with Joy in the Flames, his Mind being firmly eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd on God; for he had been faithful according to his Knowledge, and had not hid his Talent in the Earth, but improv'd it, having ſhewn himſelf a zealous Promoter of that ſmall Illumination which God was pleas'd to grant him; it being, without Queſtion, great enough in that grievous Night of Darkneſs, when Idolatry had ſo univerſally blinded Mankind, that morally ſpeaking, it would have been impoſſible for them to have underſtood the Declaration of an entirely reform'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; whereas it is evident that the moſt ſober and diſcreet People of that Age were capable to underſtand the Doctrine and Sermons of that honeſt Man.</p>

               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:003104_0013_0FEFF3356D2ADDC0"/>To give a clearer Proſpect into this Matter, let it be conſider'd, that if a Man had been kept ſhut up a long Time in a dark Priſon, where he could neither behold the Light of the Sun or Moon, and ſhould have been let out on a ſudden at clear Noon-Day, he would not only not be able to endure the bright Day-Light, but would alſo, if he ſtrove to open his Eyes with Force, be endanger'd of loſing, his Sight, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into a worſe Condition than he was in before; whereas if he had been brought into the open Air at the Time of Twilight, he would by Degrees have learned to diſcern the Objects, and come to an Ability of beholding every Thing in a clear Day aright.</p>
            <p>Agreeable to this, in the Reigns of King <hi>Henry</hi> the VIIIth and the bloody Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> the principal Teſt in <hi>England</hi> was, Whether a Man owned the Corporal Preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament; and he who denied this, was to be burnt as an Heretick; alſo in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> 'twas enough <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In the Year 1513,<note place="margin">1513 J. Le Clerc.</note> I find that one <hi>John Le Clerc</hi> of <hi>Meaux</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> being at <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Priſoner for this Fact, and cruelly tortur'd to Death, he was ſo eminently ſtrengthened, even to the Amazement of the Beholders, that in the Height of the Torments, being torn with red hot Pincers, he ſaid from <hi>Pſalm</hi> cxv. <hi>Their Idols are Silver and Gold, the Work of Mens Hands.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aymond a Vie.</note> Not leſs was the Zeal of one <hi>Aymond a Vie,</hi> impriſon'd in <hi>France,</hi> about the Year 1541,<note place="margin">1541</note> becauſe he had preach'd the Goſpel un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntedly; and tho' he had been adviſed to fly, yet he would not be perſuaded thereto, but ſaid with an heroick Mind, <hi>I would rather never have been born than commit ſuch a baſe Act; for it is the Duty of a good Paſtor not to fly from Danger but to ſtay in it, leſt the Sheep be ſcattered.</hi> He was tortur'd cruelly to betray his Fellow-Believers; but no Torment, how cruel ſoever, could extort the Name of any from him; and he ſuffer'd Death valiantly for the Teſtimony of Jeſus, feeling himſelf very powerfully ſtrengthned by the Spirit of God, which work'd ſo gloriouſly in the Martyrs of thoſe Times,<note place="margin">Merindol</note> that thoſe of <hi>Merindol</hi> in <hi>Provence</hi> ſaid, <hi>The Holy Ghoſt is an infallible Teacher, by whoſe Inſpiration all Chriſtians receive the Knowledge of Truth: This Spirit dwells in them, he rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerates them to a new Life, he ſlayeth the Old Man in them, and he makes them alive to every good Work, conſolating them in Tribulations, and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening them in Adverſities,</hi> &amp;c.

               </q> For the Martyrs of thoſe Times did not ſtick to profeſs with the primitive Chriſtians, that the Children of God muſt be led by his Spirit. And ſo <hi>Peter Schryver,</hi> burnt at <hi>Lions,</hi> about the Year 1552,<note place="margin">1552 P.Schryver</note> wrote from Priſon, <q>That he having heard God's pure Word preach'd, believ'd it,</q> becauſe the Spirit of God gave him a Teſtimony [or Evidence] of it in his Heart, and did ſo confirm it to him, that he "could not queſtion it in the leaſt." He alſo ſays in his Letter, <q>That once having pray'd to God, he had been ſo refreſh'd by the Vertue of his Spirit, and ſo ſtrengthned, that tho' he ſate in a dark naſty Place, yet he felt ſuch a Conſolation and Joy, that overcame all Sorrow and Anguiſh. Nay, ſaid he, the leaſt Comfort and Joy I feel now in my Bends, ſurpaſſeth all the Joys that ever I had in my Life; for now the Holy Ghoſt puts me in Mind of thoſe gracious Promiſes that are made to thoſe who ſuffer for his Name's-ſake.</q> And being ask'd how he knew that which he aſſerted, to be the pure Word of God? He anſwer'd, <hi>Becauſe it did agree with the Doctrine of the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and that of Jeſus Chriſt; and that the Holy Ghoſt gave him a certain Evidence thereof.</hi> Concerning the Indwelling of God s Spirit in Man, he alſo ſpeaks very notably in his Letter to <hi>John Chambon,</hi> (whoſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Converſion in Priſon was an eminent Proof of the Truth of his Sayings) telling him, <hi>That his Heavenly Father was near him, and by his Spirit dwelt in his Heart.</hi> That this was alſo the Doctrine of <hi>John Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi> appears from his Letters to the ſaid Man and his Fellow-Priſoners, where he ſaith: <q>Don't doubt but God will, in thoſe Things wherein he will uſe your Service, give you that Power, by which the Work in you being begun, will be perfected, for that he hath promiſed to do: And we have many Examples and Inſtances of that excellent Faith, by which we clearly know, that God never in any Thing hath fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe who have been led and guided by his Spirit. Truſt firmly, Brethren, that when it is needful you will become ſo ſtrong and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, that you ſhall not faint under any Burden of Temptations, how great and heavy ſoever. — The Fight is now at hand, to which the Holy Ghoſt exhorts us, not only that we ſhould go, but even that with all Alacrity of Mind we ſhould run.</q> Many other excellent Teſtimonies of eminent Men of thoſe Times might be produc'd: And it alſo is very remarkable that <hi>Peter Bergier</hi> being Priſoner at <hi>Lions,</hi> in the Year 1553,<note place="margin">1553 P. Bergier</note> and afterwards ſuffering Death, cry'd in the midſt of the Flames, <hi>I ſee the Heavens open'd.</hi> Now that the Doctrine of <hi>being taught by the Spirit of God,</hi> was generally receiv'd by the Martyrs of thoſe Times, we learn from many of their Writings. <hi>Denis Peloquin</hi> burnt in the ſaid Year at <hi>Ville Franche,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Denis Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin.</note> ſaid in his Confeſſion, <hi>That it was the Holy Ghoſt that gave him Witneſs in his Conſcience, that the Books of the Old and New Teſtament were the Holy Scripture. Lewis de Marſac,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lewis de Marſac.</note> being about the ſame Time put to Death by Fire at <hi>Lions,</hi> ſaid, when he was ask'd how he knew the Holy Scriptures to be the Goſpel? <hi>God hath taught me ſo by his Spirit:</hi> And being alſo ask'd, Whether it was his incumbent Duty to read the Holy Scriptures, and who had inſtructed him concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them?

Calvin</hi> did alſo write to the aforeſaid <hi>Peloquin and Marſac: God will cauſe that the Confeſſion which you will make according to the Meaſure of the Spirit he has given you, will produce a greater Fruit of Edification than all others that might be ſent you.</hi> And to <hi>Matthew Dymonet,</hi> Priſoner at <hi>Lyons,</hi> he wrote thus; <q>Submit modeſtly to the Guidings of God's Spirit; anſwer with all Moderation and Diſcretion, keeping to the Rule of the Scriptures. I have believed, and therefore I will ſpeak; but let not this hinder thee to ſpeak freely and ſincerely, being perſuaded that he who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to give us a Mouth, and ſuch Wiſdom as the Gainſayers can't withſtand, will never forſake thee.</q> More of the like Inſtances of the Operations of the Spirit of God in his Witneſſes I could alledge, if I had ſo intended; but I give here only a ſlender Draught of the Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and the Principle of thoſe that were but come to the Dawnings of the Reformation; for higher I can't eſteem that Time, becauſe the Eyes of the moſt zealous Men of thoſe Days were yet ſo much cover'd with the Fogs which then were, and the Prejudice of the old Leaven, that they did not diſcern all Things in a full Clearneſs; for one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If we rightly look into this, it ſeems very abſurd to think that the Reformation (which in former Times had been pretty much advanced by ſome eminent Men; as <hi>Luther, Melancthon, Oecolompadius, Calvin, Men<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o,</hi> and others) then was brought to Perfection; for we perceive that even thoſe Reformers themſelves at firſt had not ſuch a clear Sight into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Things, as afterwards they got; which to demonſtrate at large, I count unneceſſary; ſince <hi>England</hi> being the chiefeſt Stage, on which the Things I intend to deſcribe, have been tranſacted, I'll turn, my Face thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therward, to take a View curſorily of the Beginning and Proceſs of the Reformation there. Paſſing by <hi>Wickliff</hi> and others, I begin with <hi>Thomas Cranmer;</hi>
               <note place="margin">T. Cranmer.</note> who, becauſe of his ſincere and good Life, being advanced by King <hi>Henry</hi> the VIIIth to the Archbiſhop's See of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> did all that was in his Power to reform the Errors crept into the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1536</note> and therefore in the Year 1536, he exhorted the King, who much loved him, to proceed to a Reformation, and that nothing in Religion ſhould be determined without clear Proofs from Scripture, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he propoſed that theſe Points, <q>Whether there was a Purgatory? Whether deceaſed Saints ought to be invocated? and how Images were to be regarded;</q> well needed to be enquired into; ſince it began to appear, that ſeveral Things were Errors, for which ſome People not long before had ſuffer'd Death.<note place="margin">T.Cromwel.</note> Some Time after, <hi>Thomas Cromwel,</hi> a chief Miniſter of the Kingdom, and a great Friend of <hi>Cranmer,</hi> publiſh'd ſome Injunctions in the King's Name, wherein all Churchmen were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd, no more to recommend to People, Images, Relicks, or Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, but to teach them the Lord's Prayer, the Creed, and the Ten Commandments in <hi>Engliſh.</hi> This was a great Step towards the Tranſlation of the Bible into <hi>English,</hi> which being alſo further'd by <hi>Cranmer,</hi> the next Year came out in Print;<note place="margin">1537</note> and by the King's Warrant, the Clergy were requir'd to ſet up Bibles it their Churches; ſo that now, all that could might read the Holy Scripture in their native Tongue. <hi>Cranmer</hi> not content with this,<note place="margin">1539</note> obtain'd in the Year 1539, a Permiſſion for all People to have the Bible in their Houſes; yet for all that, he ſtill was an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertor of the corporal Preſence of Chriſt in the Hoſt, until in the Year 1549,<note place="margin">1549 N.Ridley.</note> in the Reign of King <hi>Edward VI.</hi> when the Times were more free, he was induc'd by <hi>Nicholas Ridley,</hi> a zealous Reformer, and afterwards a Martyr under Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> to enquire better into the Thing, and to diſcover
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003104_0016_0FEFF2F36FC88F28"/>
cover the Abſurdity of it; from whence he did not only oppoſe and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſ that Superſtition, but alſo many others; and it is likely, that if Opportunity had been given him, he would have reformed more Things. Nevertheleſs, it can't but be wondred at, that he who ſeems to have been a Man of a meek Temper, could give his Vote for the Burning of thoſe whom he look'd upon to be Hereticks; as <hi>John Nicholſon,</hi> alias <hi>Lambert,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. for denying of the corporal Preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament; and <hi>Joan Bocher</hi> and <hi>George Parr</hi> under <hi>Edward</hi> VI. the firſt for denying that Chriſt had taken Fleſh from the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and the latter for not believing the Deity of Chriſt: From whence we may ſee what a wrong Zeal for Religion is able to effect: But without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion he was become of another Mind,<note place="margin">1556</note> when in the Year 1556, under the bloody Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> this was not only laid in his Diſh, but he alſo was forc'd to undergo the ſame Lot of being burnt alive.</p>
            <p>Now tho' after his Death the Biſhops under Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> were content with the Reformation made by <hi>Cranmer,</hi> yet it pleaſed God in the Year 1568,<note place="margin">1568</note> to raiſe other Perſons that teſtify'd publickly againſt many of the remaining Superſtitions; and altho' <hi>Coleman, Burton, Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingham,</hi> and <hi>Benſon,</hi> were impriſon'd by the Queen's Order, yet they got many Followers,<note place="margin">Puritans.</note> and alſo the Name of Puritans. And notwithſtanding the Archbiſhop, to prevent this, drew up ſome Articles of Faith, to be ſign'd by all Clergymen, yet he met with great Oppoſition in this Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking: For one <hi>Robert Brown,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Robt. Brown.</note> a young Student of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> (from whom the Name of <hi>Browniſts</hi> was afterwards borrowed) and <hi>Richard Harriſon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">R.

J. Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, J. Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> that ſome of the moſt zealous among them, viz. <hi>Henry Barrow, John Greenwood,</hi> and <hi>John Penry,</hi> about the Year 1593 were put to Death becauſe of their Teſtimony, more (as may very well be believ'd) by the Inſtigation of the Clergy, than by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of the Queen: For ſome time after it happen'd that ſhe ask'd Dr. <hi>Raynolds</hi> his Opinion of thoſe Men, eſpecially <hi>Barrow</hi> and <hi>Greenwood:</hi> To which he anſwer'd, <hi>That it would not avail any Thing to ſhew his Judgment concerning them, ſeeing they were put to Death.</hi> But the Queen yet preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him farther, he ſaid, <hi>That he was perſuaded if they had liv'd, they would have been two as worthy Inſtruments for the Church of God, as had been rais'd up in that Age.</hi> At which the Queen ſigh'd, and ſaid no more. But afterwards riding by the Place where they were executed, and calling to Mind their Death, ſhe demanded of the Earl of <hi>Cumberland</hi> that was preſent when they ſuffer'd, What End they made? And he anſwer'd, <hi>A very godly End; and they prayed for your Majeſty and the State.</hi> Moreover one <hi>Philips,</hi>

            <p>After the Death of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> when <hi>James</hi> I. had aſcended the Throne, the Followers of thoſe Men ſuffer'd much for their Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the Church of <hi>England:</hi> But very remarkable it is, that even thoſe of that Perſuaſion, of which many in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> I. went to <hi>New-England,</hi> to avoid the Perſecution of the Biſhops, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards themſelves turn'd cruel Perſecutors of pious People, by inhumane Whippings, <hi>&amp;c</hi> and laſtly by putting ſome to Death by the Hands of a Hangman: A clear Proof indeed, that thoſe in whom ſuch a Ground of Bitterneſs was left ſtill, tho' it had not always brought forth the like abominable Fruits, were not come yet to a perfect Reformation; for tho' the Stem of humane Traditions and Inſtitutions ſometimes had been

For among the manifold Adverſities, we ſhall not only meet with bitter Revilings, ſcornful Mockings, rude Abuſes, and bloody Blows from the fool-hardy Rabble, but alſo ſevere Perſecutions, hard Impriſonments, grievous Baniſhments, unmerciful Spoil of Goods, cruel Whippings, Cutting off of Ears, Smotherings in Priſons, and alſo putting to Death by the Hands of an Hangman, by Order of the Magiſtrates: Afterwards ſome Quiet and Reſt; then again ſevere Perſecution, until the furious Promoters of it, at laſt wearied, deſiſted from their miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Labour for a Time, more by being at their Wits-end, than out of Mercy. And among all theſe Viciſſitudes, notable Inſtances have been ſeen of unfeigned Godlineſs, ſincere Love, much True-heartedneſs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Meekneſs, ſingular Patience, ardent Zeal, undaunted Courage, and unſhaken Stedfaſtneſs, even among the Female Sex, which tho' the weakeſt, yet in the hardeſt Attacks ſhew'd a more than manly Spirit; inſomuch, that ſeldom any Age hath afforded Matter where more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Examples to Vertue have been ſeen.

His Mother ſeeing this extraordinary Temper and Godlineſs which ſo early did ſhine thro' him, ſo that he would not meddle with childiſh Plays, did not think it fit to trouble him about the Way of Worſhip, but carried herſelf indulgent towards him. Mean while he learned to read pretty well, and to write ſo much as would ſerve him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to ſignify his Meaning to others. When he was come to eleven Years of Age, he endeavour'd to live a pure and righteous Life, and to be faithful in all Things, <hi>viz.</hi> inwardly to God, and outwardly to Man; ſince the Lord by his good Spirit had ſhewed him, that he was to keep his Word always, and that he ought not to commit Exceſs in eating or drinking. He thus growing up in Vertue, ſome of his Relations were for having him train'd up in the Schools, make a Prieſt of him; but others perſuaded to the contrary; and ſo he was put to a Shoe-maker that dealt alſo in Wool and in Cattle. Being employ'd then by his Maſter, he took moſt Delight in Sheep, and was very skilful in what belong'd thereto, for it was an Imployment that very well ſuited his Mind; and his thus being a Shepherd, was, as an eminent Author ſaith, a juſt Emblem of his after Miniſtry and Service. He did acquit himſelf ſo diligently in his buſineſs, and minded it ſo well, that his Maſter was ſuccesful in his Trade whilſt <hi>George</hi> was with him. He often uſed in his Dealings the Word <hi>verily,</hi> and then he kept ſo ſtrict to it, that People that knew him would, ſay, <hi>If</hi> George <hi>ſays</hi> verily, <hi>there is no altering him.</hi>

            <p>Now tho' my Deſign is not to give a Deſcription of State-Affairs, yet I find it neceſſary to mention ſomething of the chief temporal Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in <hi>England,</hi> in as much as they may have Relation to the Affairs of the Church; leſt my Hiſtory might ſeem an incompleat Work. Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiently therefore I will ſay, that in <hi>England</hi> about this Time appeared the Beginnings of a Civil War, in which Religion had ſome Share; for the Biſhops began to introduce ſeveral Innovations, and cauſed not only Rails to be made about the Communion-Table, which now was called the High Altar; but thoſe that approached it bowed thrice, and a Bow was made at the Pronouncing of the Name of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Thus Ceremonies increaſed from Time to Time; and thoſe Preachers that were really religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ſpoke moſt to Edification, were ſlighted and ſet by; the Biſhops, in their Viſitations, minding chiefly to promote ſuch Rites as favoured Popery. And this was not only done in <hi>England,</hi> but in <hi>Scotland</hi> alſo Endeavours were made to bring in Epiſcopacy.

            <p>Whilſt he led thus a ſolitary Lite, he faſted often, and read the Holy Scriptures diligently, ſo that ſome Profeſſors took Notice of him, and ſought to be acquainted with him. But he ſoon perceiving they did not poſſeſs what they profeſs d, grew afraid of them, and ſhun'd their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. In this time he fell into a ſtrong Temptation, almoſt to Deſpair, and was in mighty Trouble, ſometimes keeping himſelf retir'd in his Chamber, and often walking ſolitarily to want upon the Lord. In this State he ſaw how Chriſt had been tempted; but when he look'd to his own Condition, he wondered, and ſaid, <hi>Was I ever ſo before.</hi> He began to think alſo that he had done amiſs againſt his Relations, becauſe he had forſaken them; and he called to Mind all his former Time, to conſider whether he had wrong'd any. Thus Temptations grew more and more; and when Satan could not effect his Deſign upon him that Way, he laid Snares for him to draw him to commit ſome Sin, thereby to bring him to Deſpair. He was then about twenty Years of Age, and continu'd a long while in this Condition, and would fain have put it from him; which made him go to many a Prieſt to look for Comfort, but he did not find it from them. In this miſerable State he went to <hi>London,</hi> in Hopes or finding ſome Relief among the great Profeſſors of that City: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come there, he ſaw them much darkned in their Underſtandings.

Then <hi>Nathaniel Stevens,</hi> the Prieſt of <hi>Drayton,</hi> (the Town of <hi>George</hi>'s Birth) would often come to him, and <hi>George</hi> to the Prieſt; and when <hi>Stevens</hi> viſited him he would ſometimes bring another Prieſt along with him, and then <hi>George Fox</hi> would ask them Queſtions, and did reaſon with them. Once <hi>Stevens</hi> ask d him, <hi>Why Chriſt cry d out upon the Croſs, My God, My God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> And why he ſaid, <hi>If it be poſſible let this Cup paſs from me; yet not my Will, but thine be done?</hi> To this <hi>George Fox</hi> anſwer d thus; <q>At that Time the Sins of all Mankind were upon Chriſt, and their Iniquities and Tranſgreſſions with which he was wounded, which he was to bear, and to be an Offering for them, as he was Man, but died not as he was God: And ſo, in that he died for all Men, and taſted Death for every Man, he was an Offering for the Sins of the whole World.</q> When <hi>George Fox</hi> ſpoke this, he was in a Meaſure ſenſible of Chriſt's Sufferings, and what he went through. And his ſaying ſo, did ſo pleaſe the Prieſt, that he ſaid, <hi>It was a very good full An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and ſuch an one as he had not heard.</hi> He would alſo applaud and ſpeak highly of <hi>George Fox</hi> to others, and what <hi>George</hi> ſaid in Diſcourſe to him, that he would preach of on the Firſt Days of the Week: For which <hi>George</hi> did not like him. After ſome Time he went to an ancient Prieſt at <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Then the Prieſt bid him come again, and that then he would tell him many Things. But when <hi>George</hi> came, the Prieſt was angry and pettiſh, for <hi>George</hi>'s former Words had diſpleaſed him; and he was ſo indiſcreet, that what <hi>George Fox</hi> had told him of his Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows and Griefs, he told again to his Servants, ſo that it got among the Milk-Laſſes; which grieved him to have opened his Mind to ſuch an one; and he ſaw they were all miſerable Comforters. Then he heard of a Prieſt living about <hi>Tamworth,</hi> who was accounted an experienced Man, and therefore he went to him, but found him like an empty hollow Cask. Hearing afterwards of one Dr. <hi>Craddock</hi> of <hi>Coventry,</hi> he went to him alſo, and asked him whence Temptations and Deſpair did ariſe, and how Troubles came to be wrought in Man. The Prieſt, inſtead of anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ask'd him, <hi>Who was Chriſt's Father and Mother?</hi> And <hi>George</hi> told him, Mary <hi>was his Mother, and he was ſuppoſed to be the Son of</hi> Joſeph, <hi>but he was the Son of God.</hi> Now as they were walking together in Dr. <hi>Craddock</hi>'s Garden, it happen'd that <hi>George</hi> in turning, ſet his Foot on the Side of a Bed, which ſo diſturbed that Teacher, as if his Houſe had been on Fire, and thus all their Diſcourſe was loſt; and <hi>George Fox</hi> went away in Sorrow, worſe than he was when he came, ſeeing he found none that could reach his Condition. After this he went to one <hi>Macham,</hi> a Prieſt of high Account; and he, no more skilful than the others, was for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>George</hi> ſome Phyſick and for bleeding him; but they could not get one Drop of Blood from him, either in the Arms or the Head, his Body being, as it were, dried up with Sorrows, Grief, and Trouble, which were ſo great upon him, that he could have wiſhed never to have been born, to behold the Vanity and Wickedneſs of Men; or that he had been born blind, and ſo he might never have ſeen it; and deaf,

            <p>Whilſt the Mind of <hi>George Fox</hi> was thus in Trouble, the State of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was alſo in a great Stir; for the Parliament was for turning out of Biſhops, and introducing the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Directory; which however as yet could not well be effected, altho' <hi>William Laud,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> had been made to ſtoop to the Block; and the Power of the King by this Time was much weaken'd; for his Army was this Summer near <hi>Naſeby,</hi> not far from <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> overcome by an Army of untrain d Bands, and about ſix Thouſand Men, among which many great Officers were taken Priſoners, and his Cabinet, with abundance of Letters of great Moment, was ſeiz'd; inſomuch, that tho' ſome Skirmiſhes were held, yet no deciſive Battle was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ideration aroſe in him, how it was ſaid, that <hi>All Chriſtians are Believers,</hi> both Proteſtants and Papiſts: And it was opened to him, that if all were Believers, then they were all born of God, and paſſed from Death to Life, and that none were true Believers but ſuch: And tho' others ſaid they were Believers, yet they were not. At ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Time as he was walking in a Field on a Firſt Day Morning, it was diſcover d unto his Underſtanding, that <hi>to be bred at</hi> Oxford, <hi>or</hi> Cambridge <hi>was not enough to make a Man to be a Miniſter of Chriſt.</hi> At this he won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der d, becauſe it was the common Belief of People; but for all that, he took this to be a divine Revelation, and he admir d the Goodneſs of the Lord, believing now the ordinary Miniſters not to be ſuch as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be. This made him unwilling to go any more to Church, as it was called, to hear the Prieſt <hi>Stevens,</hi> believing that he could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit thereby: And therefore inſtead of going there, he would get into the Orchard, or the Fields, by himſelf with his Bible, which he eſteemed above all Books, ſeeking thus to be edified in Solitarineſs. At this his Relations were much troubled: But he told them, <hi>Did not</hi> John <hi>the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſay to the Believers, that they needed no Man to teach them, but as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing teacheth them?</hi> And tho' they knew this to be Scripture, and that it was true, yet it grieved them, becauſe he would not go to hear the Prieſt with them, but ſeparated himſelf from their Way of Worſhip: For he ſaw now, that a true Believer was another Thing than they looked upon it to be; and that being bred at the Univerſities did not qualify a Man to be a Miniſter of Chriſt. Thus he lived by himſelf, not joining with any; nay, not of the Diſſenting People, but became a Stranger to all, relying wholly upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Sometime after it was opened in him, <hi>That God, who made the World, did not dwell in Temples made with Hands.</hi> And tho' this ſeemed at firſt ſtrange to him, becauſe both Prieſts and People uſed to call their Churches <hi>Dreadful Places, Holy Ground, and Temples of God,</hi> yet it was immediately ſhew'd him, that the Lord did not dwell in theſe Temples which Man had erected, but in People's Hearts, and that his People were the Temple he dwelt in. This was diſcover'd to him when he was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               </gap>e, it was told him, that <hi>Nathaniel Stevens,</hi> the Prieſt, had been there, and told them, he was afraid of <hi>Fox,</hi> for going after new Lights. This made him ſmile, becauſe now he ſaw the true State of the Prieſts. But he ſaid nothing of it to his Relations, who tho' they ſaw that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more was requir'd than the vulgar Way of Worſhip, yet they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu d therein, being grieved becauſe he would not alſo go to hear the Prieſts. Only he told them there was an Anointing in Man, to reach him; and that the Lord would teach his People himſelf. He had great Open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings now concerning the Things written in the Revelations; and when he ſpake of them, the Prieſts and Profeſſors would ſay, That was <hi>a ſealed up Book.</hi> But to this he ſaid, <q>Chriſt could open the Seals; and that the Things contain d in that Book, very nearly concern'd us; ſince the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles were written to the Saints of thoſe Times, but the Revelations to point at Things to come.</q> In <hi>England</hi> in thoſe Days were People of very odd Notions, and among the reſt ſuch as held, <hi>that Wom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But let us return to <hi>George Fox,</hi> who in the Beginning of the Year 1647,<note place="margin">1647 Darbyſhire.</note> feeling ſome Drawings to go into <hi>Darbyſhire,</hi> went thither, and meeting there with ſome Friendly People, had many Diſcourſes with them.

But his Troubles and Temptations ſtill continu'd, and he faſted much, and walked often abroad in ſolitary Places, taking his

Bible with him;<note place="margin">1647</note> and then ſat in hollow Trees, and loneſome Places till Night came on; and frequently in the Night he walked mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully about, being ſurrounded with many Sorrows in the Times of theſe firſt Workings of the Lord in him.</p>
            <p>During all this Time he never joined in Profeſſion of Religion with any, but gave up himſelf to the diſpoſing of the Lord, having ſo taken not only all evil Company, but alſo taken Leave of Father and Mother, and all other Relations; and ſo he travelled up and down as a Stranger on the Earth, which Way he felt his Heart inclin'd: And when he came into a Town, he took a Chamber to himſelf there, and carried ſometimes a Month, ſometimes more, ſometimes leſs in a Place; for he was afraid of ſtaying long in any Place, leſt, being a tender young Man, he ſhould be hurt by too familiar a Converſation with M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ought heavenly Wiſdom, and endeavour'd to get Knowledge of the Lord, and to be weaned from out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Things to rely wholly on the Lord alone. Now tho' his Troubles were great, yet they were not ſo continual, but that he had ſome Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, and was ſometimes brought into ſuch an heavenly Joy, that admiring the Love of God to his Soul, he would ſay with the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Thou, Lord, makeſt a fruitful Field a barren Wilderneſs, and a barren Wilderneſs a fruitful Field.</hi> Now he regarded the Prieſts but little, becauſe he clearly ſaw that to be trained up in the Univerſities, and to be inſtructed in Languages, liberal Arts, and the like Sciences, was not ſufficient to make any one a Miniſter of the Goſpel: But he look'd more after the Diſſenting People: Yet as he had forſaken the Prieſts, ſo he left the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Preachers alſo, becauſe he ſaw there was none among them all that could ſpeak to his Condition. And when all his Hopes in them, and in all Men were gone, then he heard, according to what he relates himſelf, a Voice which ſaid, <hi>There is one, even Chriſt Jeſus, that can ſpeak to thy Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> He having heard this, his Heart leapt for Joy; and it was ſhewed him why there was none upon the Earth that could ſpeak to his Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, namely, that he might give the Lord alone all the Glory, and that Jeſus Chriſt might have the Pre-eminence. He then experimentally knowing that Chriſt enlightens Man, and gives him Grace, Faith, and Power, his Deſires after the Lord, and his Zeal in the pure Knowledge of God grew ſtronger, ſo that he wiſhed to encreaſe therein without the Help of any Man, Book, or Writing. Yet he was a diligent Reader of the Holy Scriptures, that ſpeak at large of God and Chriſt, tho' he knew him not but by Revelation, as he, who had the Key, did open. Thus he enter'd into no Fellowſhip with any Society of People, becauſe he ſaw no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Corruptions every where, which made him endeavour to keep Fellowſhip only with Chriſt; ſince in the greateſt Temptations, when he almoſt deſpaired, it was ſhewed him, that Chriſt had been tempted by the ſame Devil; but that he had overcome him, and bruiſed his Head, and that therefore thro' the Power, Light, Grace, and Spirit of God, he himſelf might alſo overcome. Thus the Lord aſſiſted him in the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:003104_0024_0FEFF2FD27C90348"/>
deepeſt Miſeries and Sorrows, and he found his Grace to be ſufficient: Inſomuch that, tho' he had yet ſome Deſires after the Help of Men, his Thirſt was chiefly after the Lord, the Creator of all, and his Son Jeſus Chiſt; becauſe nothing could give him any Comfort but the Lord by his Power; and he clearly ſaw that all the World, tho' he had poſſeſſed a King's State, would not have profited him. In this Condition his Underſtanding came more and more to be opened, ſo that he ſaw how Death in <hi>Adam</hi> had paſſed upon all Men; but that by Chriſt, who taſted Death for all Men, a Deliverance from it and an Entrance into God's Kingdom might be obtain'd. Nevertheleſs his Temptations continu'd, ſo that he began to queſtion whether he might have ſinned againſt the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt. This brought great Perplexity and Trouble over him for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Days; yet he ſtill gave up himſelf to the Lord: And one Day, when he had been walking ſolitarily abroad, and was come home, he became exceeding ſenſible of the Love of God to him, ſo that he could not but admire it. In this Condition it was ſhew'd him, that all was to be done in and by Chriſt; that he conquers and deſtroys the Tempter, the Devil, and all his Works; and that all theſe Troubles and Temptations were good for him for the Trial of his Faith. The Effect of this was, that tho' at Times his Mind was much exerciſed, yet he was ſtayed by a ſecret Belief, and his Soul (by a firm Hope) which was to him as an Anchor, was kept unhurt in the diſolute World, ſwimming above the raging Waves of Temptations. After this (as he relates himſelf) there did a pure Fire appear in him; and he ſaw that the Appearance ot Chriſt in the Heart was as a Refiner's Fire, and as the Fuller's Soap; and that a ſpiritual Diſcerning was given to him, by which he ſaw what it was that vail'd his Mind, and what it was that did open it: And that which could not abide in Patience, he found to be of the Fleſh, that could not give up to the Will of God, nor yield up it ſelf to die by the Croſs, <hi>to wit,</hi> the Power of God. On the other hand, he perceived it was the Groans of the Spirit which did open his Underſtanding, and that in that Spirit there muſt be a waiting upon God to obtain Redemption.</p>
            <p>About this Time he heard of a Woman in <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> that had faſted twenty two Days; and he went to ſee her; but coming there he ſaw that ſhe was under a Temptation: And after he had ſpoken to her what he felt on his Mind,<note place="margin">Duckenfield<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This, by what I can find, was the firſt Beginning of <hi>George Fox</hi>'s Preaching,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>G.

And it ſeems to me that theſe People, and alſo <hi>Elizabeth Hooton,</hi> (already mention'd) have been the firſt who by ſuch a mean or weak Preaching came to be his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Believers: Tho' there have been alſo ſome others who by the like immediate Way, as <hi>George Fox</hi> himſelf, have been convinced in their Minds, and came to ſee that they ought diligently to take Heed to the Teachings of the Grace of God that hath appeared to them. And thus it happened that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſe unexpectedly and unawares came to meet with Fellow-Believers, which they were not acquainted with before, as will be more circumſtantially related hereafter.</p>
            <p>But to return again to <hi>George Fox:</hi> It ſet the Profeſſors of thoſe Times in a Rage, that ſome of their Adhe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Life, as a State that could be obtained here. Not long after he travelled to <hi>Broughton</hi> in <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> and went there into a Meeting of the <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> where ſome People of other Notions alſo came. This gave him Occaſion to preach the Doctrine of Truth among them, and that not in vain; for ſince he had great Openings in the Scriptures, and that a ſpecial Power of the Lord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Workings began to ſpring in thoſe Parts, ſeveral were ſo reach'd in their Minds, that they came to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, and were turned from Darkneſs to Light, partly by his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and partly by reaſoning with ſome. Yet he himſelf was ſtill ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times under great Temptations, without finding any to open his Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to, but the Lord alone, unto whom he cried Night and Day for Help. Some time after he went back into <hi>Nottinghamſhire,</hi> and there it pleaſed the Lord to ſhew him, that the Natures of thoſe Things which were hurtful without, were alſo within in the Minds of wicked Men; and that the Natures of Dogs, Swine, Vipers, and thoſe of <hi>Cain Iſhmael, I ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d him, <hi>That it was needful he ſhould have a Senſe of all Conditions; how elſe ſhould he ſpeak to all Conditions?</hi> He alſo ſaw there was an Ocean of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Death; but withal an infinite Ocean of Light and Love, which flowed over the Ocean of Darkneſs; in all which he perceived the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Love of God. About that Time it happened that he walking in the Town of <hi>Mansfield,</hi> by the Steeple-houſe Side, it was inwardly told him, <hi>That which People trample upon muſt be thy Food;</hi> and at the ſaying of this, it was opened to him, that it was the Life of Chriſt People did trample upon; and that they fed one another with Words, without mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that thereby the Blood of the Son of God was trampled under Foot. And tho' it ſeemed at firſt ſtrange to him, that he ſhould feed on that which the high Profeſſors trampled upon, yet it was clearly open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him how this could be.</p>
            <p>Then many People came far and near to ſee him; and tho' he ſpoke ſometimes, to open religious Matters to them, yet he was fearful of being drawn out by them. Now the Reaſon of People thus ftocking to him might proceed partly from this: There was one <hi>Brown,</hi> who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Death-Bed ſpoke by way of Prophecy many notable Things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>George Fox,</hi> and among the reſt, <hi>that he ſhould be made inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal by the Lord to the Converſion of People.</hi> And of others that then were ſomething in Shew, he ſaid, <hi>That they ſhould come to nothing.</hi> Which was fulfilled in Time, tho' this Man did not live to ſee it, for he was not raiſed from his Sickneſs But after he was buried, <hi>George Fox</hi> fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch a Condition, that he not only look<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> like a dead Body, but unto many that came to ſee him he ſeemed as if he had been dead really: And many viſited him for about fourteen Days Time, who wondered to ſee him ſo much alter'd in Countenance. But at length his Sorrows and Troubles began to wear off, and Tears of Joy dropped from him, ſo that he could have wept Night and Day with Tears of Joy in Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs of Heart. And to give an Account of his Condition to thoſe that are able to comprehend it, I'll give his own Words. <hi>I ſaw</hi> ſaith he, <hi>into that which was without End, and Things which cannot be uttered, and of the Greatneſs and Infiniteneſs of the Love of God, which cannot be expreſs'd by Words: For I had been brought thro' the very Ocean of Darkneſs and Death, and thro' and over the Power of Satan, by the eternal glorius Power of Chriſt: Even thro' that Darkneſs, was I brought which covered all the World, and which chained down all, and ſhut up all in the Death. And the ſame eternal Power of God, which brought me thro' thoſe Things, was that which afterwards
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:003104_0026_0FEFF301D338AB68"/>
ſhook the Nation, Prieſts, Profeſſors, and People. Then could I ſay, I had been in Spiritual</hi> Babylon, Sodom, Egypt, <hi>and the Grave; but by the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Power of God I was come out of it, and was brought over it, and the Power of it, into the Power of Chriſt. And I ſaw the Harveſt white, and the Seed of God lying thick in the Ground, as ever did Wheat, that was ſown outwardly, and none to gather it: And for this I mourned with Tears.</hi> Thus far <hi>George Fox</hi>'s own Words, of whom now a Report went abroad, <hi>That he was a young Man that had a Diſcerning Spirit:</hi> Whereupon many Profeſſors, Prieſts, and People came to him, and his Miniſtry encreaſed; for he having received great Openings, ſpoke to them of the Things of God, and was heard with Attention by many, who going away, ſpread the Fame thereof. Then came the Tempter, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>et upon him again, charging him that he had ſinned againſt the Holy Ghoſt; but he could not tell in what; and then <hi>Paul</hi>'s Condition came before him, how after he had been taken up into the third Heavens, and ſeen Things not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be uttered, a Meſſenger of Satan was ſent to buffet him, that he might not exalt himſelf. Thus <hi>George Fox,</hi> by the Aſſiſtance of the Lord, got alſo over that Temptation. Now the 47th Year of that Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury drew to an End; and State-Affairs in <hi>England</hi> grew more and more clouded and intricate; for the King not thinking himſelf any longer ſafe at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> whither he had been brought from the Army, he withdrew to the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> whilſt the Parliament ſtill inſiſted on the Abrogation of Epiſcopacy, and would be Maſter of the Military For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Which the King not being willing to yield to, was now kept in cloſer Cuſtody, and no more regarded as a Sovereign, to whom Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was due from the Parliament.</p>
            <p>Under theſe inteſtine Troubles the Minds of many People came to be fitted to receive a nearer Way and Doctrine of Godlineſs; and it was in the Year 1648,<note place="margin">1648</note> that ſeveral Perſons ſeeking the Lord were become Fellow-Believers, and entred into Society with <hi>George Fox;</hi> inſomuch that they began to have great Meetings in <hi>Nottinghamſhire,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Nottingham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</note> which were viſited by many. About that Time there was a Meeting of Prieſts and Profeſſors at a Juſtice's Houſe, and <hi>George Fox</hi> went among them, and heard them diſcourſe concerning what the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>He had not known Sin but by the Law, which ſaid, Thou ſhalt not luſt.</hi> And ſince they held that to be ſpoken of the outward Law, <hi>George Fox</hi> told them, <q>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> ſpoke that after he was convinc'd; for he had the outward Law before, and was bred up in it, when he was in the Luſt of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution; but it was the Law of God in his Mind, which he ſerved, and which the Law in his Members warred againſt.</q> This Saying found ſo much Entrance, that thoſe of the Prieſts and Profeſſors that were moſt moderate, yielded, and conſented, that it was not the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Law, but the Inward, that ſhewed the inward Luſt, which the Apoſtle ſpake of. After this he went again to <hi>Mansfield,</hi> where was a great Meeting of Profeſſors and other People; and being among them, and moved to pray, ſuch an extraordinary Power appeared, and ſeized on the Hearts of ſome in ſo eminent a Manner, that even the House ſeem'd to be ſhaken: And after Prayer, ſome of the Auditory began to ſay, that This reſembled that in the Days of the Apoſtles, when on the Day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> the Houſe where they were met was ſhaken.</p>
            <p>Not long after this, there was another great Meeting of Profeſſors, where <hi>G. Fox</hi> came alſo; who hearing them diſcourſe about the Blood of Chriſt, he cry'd out among them: <hi>Do ye not ſee the Blood of Chriſt? Ye muſt ſee it in your Hearts, to ſprinkle your Hearts and Conſciences from dead Works, to ſerve the living God.</hi> This was a Doctrine which ſtartled theſe Profeſſors, who would have the Blood of Chriſt only without them, not

thinking that it was to be felt inwardly.<note place="margin">1648</note> But a certain Captain, whoſe Name was <hi>Amos Stoddard,</hi> was ſo reached, that ſeeing how they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to bear <hi>G.

               <note place="margin">Leiceſter-ſh.</note> his own Country, where ſeveral tender People came to be convinced by his Preaching. And paſſing thence into <hi>Warwickſhire,</hi> he met with a great Company of Profeſſors, who being come together in the Field, were praying and expounding the Scriptures. Here the Bible was given him, which he opened on the 5th of <hi>Matthew,</hi> where Chriſt expounded ſome Parts of the Law; from whence <hi>G. Fox</hi> took Occaſion to open to them the inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward State of Man. And that which he held forth getting ſome Ground, they fell into a fierce Contention among themſelves, and ſo parted.</p>
            <p>Then he heard of a great Meeting to be at <hi>Leiceſter</hi> for a Diſpute, wherein thoſe of ſeveral Perſuations, as <hi>Presbyterians, Independents, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopalians</hi> were ſaid to be all concern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d. This Meeting being appointed to be in the Steeple-houſe, he went thither, where Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of People were met, ſome of thoſe that ſpoke being in Pews, and the Prieſt in the Pulpit. At laſt after ſeveral Reaſonings, a Woman ſtarted a Queſtion, and asked, <hi>What that Birth was the Apoſtle</hi> Peter <hi>ſpoke of;</hi> viz. <hi>a being born again of incorruptible Seed, by the Word of God, that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth and abideth for ever?</hi> The Prieſt, inſtead of anſwering this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſaid to her, <hi>I permit not a Woman to ſpeak in the Church,</hi> tho' he had before given Liberty for any to ſpeak. This kindled <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s Zeal, ſo that he ſtept up and ask'd the Prieſt, <hi>Doſt thou call this Place</hi> (the Steeple-houſe) <hi>a Church? Or doſt thou call this mixt Multitude a Church?</hi> But the Prieſt not anſwering to this, asked <hi>What a Church was?</hi> And <hi>G. Fox</hi> told him, <hi>The Church was the Pillar and Ground of Truth, made up of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Stones, Living Members, a Spiritual Houſhold, which Chriſt was the Head of: But he was not the Head of a mixt Multitude, or of an old Houſe, made up of Lime, Stones, and Wood.</hi> This cauſed ſuch a Stir, that the Prieſt came down out of his Pulpit, and others out of their Pews, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Diſpute was marr'd.

               <hi>G.

About that Time, as he was ſitting by the Fire one Morning, a Cloud came over him, and a Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation beſet him; and he ſitting ſtill, it was ſuggeſted, <hi>All Things come by Nature;</hi> and he was in a Manner quite clouded; but he continuing to ſit ſtill, the People of the Houſe perceived nothing: At length a living Hope aroſe in him, and alſo a Voice, that ſaid, <hi>There is a living God, who made all Things;</hi> and immediately the Cloud and Temptation vaniſhed away, whereby his Heart was made glad, and he praiſed the Lord.</p>
            <p>Not long after, he met with ſome People that had a miſchievous No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>That there was no God, but that all Things came by Nature.</hi> But he reaſoning with them, ſo confounded them, that ſome were fain to confeſs that there was a living God.

Fox,</hi> he told him, <hi>That he was ſo ſmitten when he ſpoke to him, that he had ſcarce any Strength left in him.</hi> And this Man was ſo thoroughly convinced, that he turned from his Wickedneſs, and became an honeſt ſober Man, to the Aſtoniſhment of thoſe that knew him before. Thus the Work of <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s Miniſtry went forward, and many were thereby turn'd from Darkneſs to Light; and divers Meetings of his Friends, who were much increaſed in Number ſince the Year 1646, were now ſet up in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Places. Now <hi>G. Fox</hi> was come up to quite another State than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly he had lived in; for he knew now not only a Renewing of the Heart, and a Reſtoration of the Mind, but the Virtues of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were alſo open'd to him; ſo that he began to deliberate whether he ſhould practiſe Phyſick for the Good of Mankind. But God had another Service for him; and it was ſhewed him that he was to enter into a Spiritual Labour; and alſo that thoſe who continu'd faithful to the Lord, might attain to a State in which the ſinful Inclination was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Moreover the three great Profeſſions in the World, <hi>viz.</hi> Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, Divinity, (ſo called) and Law, were opened to him, whereby he ſaw that the Phyſicians wanting the Wiſdom of God, by whicn the Creatures were made, knew not their Virtues: That the Lawyers gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that theſe Phyſicians, Lawyers, and Prieſts, who pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ended to cure the Body, to eſtabliſh the Property of the People, and to cure the Soul, were all without the true Knowledge and Wiſdom they ought to poſſeſs. Yet he felt there was a Divine Power, by which all might be reformed, if they would receive, and bow unto it. And he ſaw alſo, that tho' the Prieſts did err, yet they were not the greateſt Deceivers ſpoken of in the Scriptures; but that theſe great Deceivers were ſuch, who, as <hi>Cain,</hi> had heard the Voice of God, and who, as <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> and their Company, were come out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and thro' the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> and had praiſed God on the Banks of the Sea-ſhore; and who being come as far as <hi>Balaam,</hi> could ſpeak the Word of the Lord, as having heard his Voice, and known his Spirit, ſo that they could ſee the Star of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the Goodlineſs of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Tents, which no Enchantment could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt: Theſe that could ſpeak ſo much of their Divine Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and yet turn'd from the Spirit of God, and went into the Ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="18" facs="unknown:003104_0029_0FEFF3491E026F20"/>
He ſaw alſo that People generally did read the Scriptures, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a true Senſe of them; for ſome cry'd out much againſt <hi>Cain, Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael, Eſau, Corah, Balaam, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>The Lord had alſo opened to him now, that <hi>Every Man was enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Divine Light of Chriſt;</hi> and he ſaw that they that believed in it, came out of Condemnation, and became the Children of the Light: But they that hated it, and did not believe in it, were condemn'd by it, tho' they made a Profeſſion of Chriſt. All this he ſaw in the pure Openings of the Light. He alſo ſaw that God had afforded a Meaſure of his Spirit to all Men, and that thereby they could truly come to ſerve the Lord, and to worship him; and that his Grace, which brings Salvation, and had appeared to all Men, was able to bring them into the Favour of God.</p>
            <p>And on a certain Time, as he was walking in the Fields, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that it was ſaid to him <hi>Thy Name is witten in the Lamb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s Book of Life, which was before the Foundation of the World.</hi> This he took to be the Voice of the Lord, and believed it to be true. Then he felt himſelf powerfully moved to go abroad into the World, which was like a briery thorny Wilderneſs; and he found then that the World ſwelled againſt him, and made a Noiſe like the great raging Waves of the Sea. For when he came to proclaim the Day of the Lord amongſt the Prieſts, Profeſſors, Magiſtrates, and People, they were all like a diſturbed Sea. Now he was ſent to turn People from Darkneſs to the Light, that they might receive Chriſt Jeſus; for he ſaw, that to as many as ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him in his Light, he would give Power to become the Sons of God: And that therefore he was to turn People to the Grace of God, and to the Truth in the Heart; and that by this Grace they might be taught, and thereby obtain Salvation; ſince Chriſt had died for all Men, and was a Propitiation for all, having enlightned all Men with his Divine and Saving Light, and the Manifeſtation of the Spirit of God being given to every Man to profit withal. He now being ſent thus to preach the Everlaſting Goſpel, did it with Gladneſs and endeavour'd to bring People off from their own Ways, to Chriſt, the new and living Way, and from their Churches, which Men had made and gathered, to the Church in God, the general Aſſembly written in Heaven, which Chriſt is the Head of; and from the World's Teachers, made by Men, to learn of Chriſt, who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life; and of whom the Father ſaid <hi>This is my beloved Son, hear ye him;</hi> and off from the World's Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, to the Spirit of God in the inward Parts, that in it they might worſhip the Father, who ſeeks ſuch to worſhip him.</p>
            <p>Now he found alſo that the Lord forbad him to put off his Hat to arry Men, high or low; and he was required to <hi>Thou</hi> and <hi>Thee</hi> every Man and Woman, without Diſtinction, and not to bid People <hi>Good Morrow</hi> or <hi>Good Evening;</hi> neither right he bow, or ſcrape with his Leg to any one. This was ſuch an unuſual Thing with People, that it made many of all Perſuations and Profeſſions rage againſt him; but by the Aſſiſtance of the Lord he was carry'd over all, and many came to be his Fellow-Believers, and turn'd God, in a little Time; altho' it is almoſt unſpeakable what Rage and Fury aroſe, what Blows, Pinchings, Beatings, and Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they underwent, beſides the Danger they were ſometimes in of loſing their Lives for theſe Matters: So indiſcreet is Man in his natural State. For here it did not avail to ſay, <q>That the Hat-Honour was an Honour from below, which the Lord would lay in the Duſt, and ſtain it; that it was an Honour which the Proud look'd for, without ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the Honour which came from God alone; that it was an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour invented by Men in the Fall, who therefore were offended if it were not given them; tho' they would be look'd upon as Church-Members, and good Chriſtians; whereas Chriſt himſelf ſaid, <hi>How can ye believe, who receive Honour of one another, and ſeek not the Honour that cometh from God only?</hi> That it was an Honour, which in Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the outward Ceremony, <hi>viz.</hi> the Putting off the Hat, was the ſame which was given to God; ſo that in the outward Sign of Reverence, no Diſtinction or Difference was made betwixt the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and the Creature: Nay, that the Saying of <hi>You</hi> to a ſingle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon went yet a Degree further; for not only Kings and Princes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly among the <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> had not been offended at it when they were <hi>Thee'd</hi> and <hi>Thou'd,</hi> but Experience ſhew'd that this ſtill was the Language wherewith God was daily ſpoken to, both in Religious Aſſemblies, and without,</q> But all theſe Reaſons found little Entrance with Prieſts, Magiſtrates, and others: Bitter Revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, ill Uſage, and ſhameful Abuſes, were now become the Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>at was but a ſmall Thing, which none ought to ſcruple; yet it was a wonderful Thing to ſee what great Diſturbance this pretended ſmall Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But all this ſerv'd to ſtrengthen the Fellow-Believers more and more in their plain Carriage, and made them live up faithfully to the Convincement of their Conſcience, without Reſpect of Perſons.</p>

Some time after the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> being then paſt fourteen Years of Age, and ſecond Son to the King, was fled to <hi>Holland,</hi> diſguiſed in Woman's Apparel; and his eldeſt Brother the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> who two Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was fled to <hi>France,</hi> came now to <hi>Helvoot-Sluce</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> and went from thence with ſome <hi>English</hi> Men of War, whoſe Commanders were for the King, to the <hi>Downs</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> with Intention to take the Ships coming from <hi>London.</hi> He alſo publiſhed, by the ſpreading of a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that he came to releaſe his Father.

This broke off the Treaty, ſeveral ſuſpected Members were turn'd out of the Parliament, and the King was carried to <hi>Windſor</hi> about the Time of <hi>Chriſtmas;</hi> and it was reſolv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But Things made no Stand here, for it was concluded to bring him to a Trial; and the Parliament appointed General <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> and <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> Lieutenant General, with more than an Hundred other Perſons, to be his Judges. Theſe being formed into a Court of Juſtice, the King was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted from <hi>Windſor</hi> to St. <hi>Ja<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> and from thence brought before them in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> where he was arraigned as guilty of High-Treaſon, for having levied War againſt the Parliament and People of <hi>England.</hi> But he not owning that Court to be lawful, nor acknowledging their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, ſaid, <hi>I am not intruſted by the People, they are mine by Inheritance.</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:003104_0031_0FEFF34C458FE3A0"/>
And being unwilling to anſwer to the Charge, he was on the 27th of the Month call'd <hi>January</hi> ſentenced to Death, as a Tyrant, Traytor, Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and a publick Enemy to the Common-wealth. But before this Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was pronounced, the King deſired that he might be permitted to make a Propoſtion to both Houſes of Parliament in the painted Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, deſigning, as was ſince ſaid, to propoſe <hi>his own Reſignation, and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of his Son, the Prince of</hi> Wales, <hi>to the Throne.</hi> But this Requeſt was denied by the Court.

The ſame Day the Parliament ordered a Declaration to be publiſhed, whereby it was declared Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to endeavour to promote the Prince of <hi>Wales, Charles Stuart,</hi> to be King of <hi>England,</hi> or any other ſingle Perſon to be the chief Governour thereof. And then after having aboliſhed the Houſe of Pee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Leaving now State-Affairs,<note place="margin">1649</note> Let's return to <hi>G. Fox,</hi> who in the Year 1649 was much exerciſed to declare openly agninſt all Sorts of Sins; and therefore he went not only to the Courts, crying for Juſtice, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting the Judges and Juſtices to do Juſitce, but he warned alſo thoſe that kept Publick-Houſes for Entertainment, not to let People have more Drink, than what would do them good. He alſo teſtified againſt Wakes, May-games, Plays, and Shews, by which People were led into Vanity, and drawn off from the Fear of God; the Days that were ſet forth for Holy-days, being uſually the Times wherein God was moſt diſhonoured. When he came in Markets, he alſo declared againſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Merchandizing, and warned all to deal juſtly, and to ſpeak the Truth; and he teſtified againſt the Mountebanks playing Tricks on their Stages: And when Occaſion offer'd, he warned the School-maſters and School-miſtreſſes to teach their Children to mind the Fear of the Lord; ſaying, that they themſelves ought to be Examples and Patterns of Vertue to them. But very burdenſome it was to him, when he heard the Bell ring to call People together to the Steeple-houſe; for it ſeemed to him juſt like a Market-Bell, to gather the People, that the Prieſt might ſet forth his Ware to Sale. Going once on a Firſt-Day of the Week,<note place="margin">Nottingham.</note> in the Morning, with ſome of his Friends to <hi>Nottingham,</hi> to have a Meeting there; and having <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

the Steeple-houſe,<note place="margin">1649</note> where the Prieſt took for his Text theſe Words of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter: We have alſo a more ſure Word of Prophecy, whereunto ye do well that ye take Heed, as unto a Light that ſhineth in a dark Place, until the Day dawn, and the Day-ſtar ariſe in your Hearts.</hi> And he told the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that this was the Scripture, by which they were to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That was it which led into all Truth, and gave the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof. For the Jews had the Scriptures, and yet reſiſted the Holy Ghoſt, and rejected Chriſt, the bright Morning-Star, and perſecuted him and his Apoſtles; tho' they took upon them to try their Doctrine by the Scriptures; but they erred in Judgment, and did not try them aright, becauſe they did it without the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> He thus ſpeaking, the Officers came and took him away, and put him into a naſty ſtinking Priſon. At Night he was brought before the Mayor, Aldermen, and Sheriffs of the Town; and they examining him, he told them, That the Lord had moved him to come there into the Steeple-houſe: And tho' the Mayor at firſt appeared peeviſh and fretful, yet he was allayed: However, after ſome Diſcourſe <hi>G.

            <p>
               <hi>G. Fox</hi> thus coming to lodge at this Sheriff's Houſe, had great Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings there, and ſome Perſons of Quality in the World, came to them; and they were reach'd very eminently in their Minds by an inviſible Power.<note place="margin">J. Reckleſs</note> 
               <hi>Reckleſs</hi> being of this Number, ſent for the other Sheriff, and for a Woman they traded with; and he told her in the Preſence of the other Sheriff, that they had wronged her in their Dealings with her, and that therefore they ought to make her Reſtitution; to which <hi>Reckleſs</hi> exhorted the other Sheriff, being himſelf made ſenſible that this was an indiſpenſable Duty: For a mighty Change was now wrought in him, and his Underſtanding came to be opened; ſo that on the next Market-Day, as he was walking with <hi>G.

Then they hal'd him out, who was hardly able to ſtand, and put him into the Stocks, where he ſat ſome Hours: And they having brought Horſe-Whips, threaten'd to whip him. After ſome Time they had him before the Magiſtrates, at a Knight's Houſe; who ſeeing how ill he had been uſed, ſet him at Liberty, after much Threatning. But the rude Multitude ſtoned him out of the Town; and tho' he was ſcarce able to go, yet with much ado he got about a Mile from the Town, where he met with ſome People that gave him ſomething to comfort him, becauſe he was inwardly bruiſed. But it pleaſed the Lord ſoon to heal him again; and ſome People were that Day convinced of the Truth, which had been declared by him in the Steeple-houſe, at which he rejoyced.<note place="margin">Leiceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.

After ſome other Diſcourſe, they parted. On the next Firſt-Day of the Week, <hi>G.

               <note place="margin">Darby-ſhire. Cheſterfield.

But when the Prieſt of that Town died, he got the Parſonage. <hi>G. Fox</hi> now ſpeaking to him and the People, endeavour'd to bring them off from Man's Teaching, unto God's Teaching: And tho' the Prieſt was not able to gainſay, yet they had him before the Mayor, and threatned to ſend him to the Houſe of Correction: But when it was late in the Night, the Officers and the Watchmen led him out of the Town.</p>
            <p>Concerning State-Affairs it hath been ſaid already, that <hi>Charles</hi> II. had been proclaimed King by the <hi>Scots;</hi> but he being ſtill in <hi>Holland,</hi> they ſent to him there, that he would ſubſcribe the Covenant, and ſo abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate Epiſcopacy in <hi>Scotland:</hi> It was alſo deſired that he would put ſome Lords from him. But thoſe that were ſent, received only an Anſwer from the young King in general Terms, which made them return home again, where we will leave them, to ſee in the mean while how it went with <hi>G.

            </p>
            <p>He having been ſent away, as hath been ſaid, from <hi>Cheſterfield,</hi> came to <hi>Darby</hi> in the year 1650,<note place="margin">Darby 1650</note> and lay at a Doctor's Houſe, whoſe Wife was convinced of the Truth he preached.

of the Officers of the Army, and Prieſts and Preachers were to be there, as alſo a Colonel that was a Preacher. Then he felt himſelf moved to go to that Congregation; and when the Service was done, he ſpoke to them what he believed the Lord required of him, and they were pretty quiet. But there came an Officer, who took him by the Hand, and ſaid, that he, and the other two that were with him, muſt go before the Magiſtrates. He then coming about the firſt Hour in the Afternoon, before them, they asked him, <hi>Why he came thither?</hi> To which having anſwer'd, <hi>That God had moved him to it;</hi> he farther ſaid, that <hi>God did not dwell in Temples made with Hands; and that all their Preaching, Baptiſm, and Sacrifices would never ſanctify them; but that they ought to look unto Chriſt in them, and not unto Men; becauſe it is Chriſt that ſanctifies.</hi> They then running into many Words, he told them, <hi>They were not to diſpute of God and Chriſt, but to obey him.</hi> But this Doctrine did ſo diſpleaſe them, that they often put him in and out of the Room, and ſometimes told him ſcoffingly, <hi>That he was taken up in Raptures.</hi> At laſt they asked him, <hi>Whether he was ſanctified?</hi> And he anſwering, <hi>Yes,</hi> they then asked, <hi>If he had no Sin?</hi> To which he ſaid, <hi>Chriſt my Saviour has taken away my Sin, and in him there is no Sin.</hi> Then he and his Friends were asked, <hi>How they knew that Chriſt did abide in them?</hi> And <hi>G. Fox</hi> ſaid, <hi>By his Spirit, that he has given us.</hi> Then they temptingly asked, <hi>If any of them was Chriſt?</hi> But he anſwered, <hi>Nay, we are nothing, Chriſt is all.</hi> At length they alſo asked, <hi>If a Man ſteals, is it no Sin?</hi> To which he anſwered with the Words of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>All <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs is Sin.</hi> So when they had wearied themſelves in examining him,<note place="margin">

               <note place="margin">1650</note> hearing that <hi>G.

            <p>Now becauſe in thoſe early Times, among the many Adherents of this Perſuaſion, were alſo ſome that having been People of a rude and diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Life, came ſo to be prick'd to the Heart, that they grew true Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, with real Sorrow for their former Tranſgreſſions; it happen'd that not only they at Meetings did burſt out into Tears, but alſo were affected with ſuch a ſingular Commotion of the Mind, that ſome Shakings of their Bodies were perceived; ſome People naturally being more affected with the Paſſions of the Mind, than others; for even Anger doth tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port ſome Men ſo violently, that it makes them tremble; whereas o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will quake with Fear: And what Wonder then, if ſome being ſtruck with the Terrors of God did tremble? But this being ſeen by envious Men, they took Occaſion from thence to tell, that theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the Light performed their Worſhip with Shaking; yet they themſelves never aſſerted that Trembling of the Body was an eſſential Part of their Religion, but have occaſionally ſaid the contrary; tho' they did not deny themſelves to be ſuch as trembled before God; and they alſo did not ſtick to ſay, that all People ought to do ſo; however thereby not enjoining a bodily Shaking.</p>
            <p>We have ſeen juſt now, how one <hi>Fretwell</hi> was committed with <hi>G. Fox</hi> to the Houſe of Correction; but he not ſtanding faithful in his Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, obtained, by Interceſſion of the Jailor, Leave of the Juſtice to go ſee his Mother, and ſo got his Liberty; and then a Report was ſpread, that he had ſaid, <hi>That</hi> G. Fox <hi>had bewitched and deceived him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>G. Fox</hi> was now become the Object of many People's Hatred; Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, Prieſts, and Profeſſors were all in a Rage againſt him; and the Jailor, to find ſomething wherewithal to enſnare him, would ſometimes ask him ſuch ſilly Queſtions, as, <hi>Whether the Door was latch'd, or not?</hi> thinking thereby to draw ſome ſudden unadviſed Anſwer from him where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might charge Sin upon him: But he was kept ſo watchful and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect, that they could get no Advantage of him. Not long after his Commitment, he was moved to write both to the Prieſts and Magiſtrates of <hi>Darby.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ger. Croeſe</note> Now ſince <hi>Ger. Croeſe</hi> in the Beginning of his Hiſtory repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents <hi>G. Fox</hi> as one altogether unfit, not only to write legibly, but alſo to expreſs his Mind clearly in Writing, and that therefore he always was oblig'd to employ others that could ſet down his Meaning intelligibly, it won't be beſides the Purpoſe to ſay, that this is more than any ever will be able to prove. For tho' it can't be denied, that he was no elegant Writer, nor good Speller, yet it is true, that his Characters being tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, his Writing was legible, and the Matter he treated was intelligible, tho' his Stile was not like that of a skilful Linguiſt. And albeit he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd others, becauſe himſelf was no quick Writer, yet generally they were young Lads, who as they durſt not have attempted to alter his Words and Phraſes, ſo they would not have been skilful enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine

fine his Stile. This I don't write from hear-ſay, but have ſeen it at ſundry Times. And how true it is what the ſame Author ſaith, That moſtly all that <hi>G. Fox</hi> did write, was ſcarce any Thing beſides a rough Collection of ſeveral Scripture Places, may be ſeen by the Sequel of this Hiſtory, wherein will be found many of his Writings. The firſt of his Letters I meet with, is the following which he wrote to the Prieſts of <hi>Darby,</hi> from the Houſe of Correction, where certainly he had not the Convenience of a Writing-Clerk.</p>

                  <hi>Tho' his Majeſty, as a dutiful Son, he obliged to honour the Memory of his Royal Father, and have in Eſtimation the Perſon of his Mother, yet doth he deſire to be deeply humbled and afflicted in Spirit before God, becauſe of his Father's hearkening to evil Counſels, and his Oppoſition to the Work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and to the Solemn League and Covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by which ſo much of the Blood of the Lord's People hath been ſhed in theſe Kingdoms, and for the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of his Mother.</hi>

               </gap>s Mercies, which made him ſpeak boldly in his Quarters amongſt the Soldiers, and others, alledging the Scriptures for what he now believed to be Truth. He alſo ſaid, <hi>His Colonel</hi> (which I take to be <hi>Barton) was as blind as</hi> Nebuchadnezzar, <hi>to caſt the Servant of the Lord into Priſon.</hi> This ſo incens'd his Colonel, that, when at the <hi>Worceſter</hi> Fight, the two Armies lying near one another, two from the King's Army challenged any two of the Parliament's Army to fight with them, the ſaid Colonel made Choice of him and another to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Challenge: And when in the Encounter his Companion was ſlain, he drove both his Enemies within a Musket-ſhot of the Town, without firing a Piſtol at them. Thus he return'd victorious; but then he ſaw the Deceit of the Officers, and how wonderfully the Lord had preſerved him; and in Proceſs of Time becoming ſenſible that fighting was unlawful for a true Chrſtian, he laid down his Arms, henceforth to fight under the Banner of the Prince of Peace, by entering into the Spiritual Warfare.</p>
            <p>Now the Time of <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s Commitment to the Houſe of Correction being very near out, and there being many new Soldiers raiſed, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners would have made him Captain over them, and the Soldiers cry'd, <hi>They would have none but him.</hi> So the Keeper of the Houſe of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection was commanded to bring him up before the Commiſſioners and Soldier's in the Market-place; and there they proffer'd him that Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (as they call'd it) asking him if he would not take up Arms for the Common-wealth, againſt <hi>Charles Stuart? G.

of his Vertue.</hi> But he not mattering thoſe flattering Words, reply'd, <q>If this be your Love and Kindneſs, I trample it under my Feet.</q> This bold Anſwer preſently ſhew'd how ſhallow their pretended Kindneſs was; for it ſo enraged them, that they ſaid, <hi>Take him away</hi>Jailer,<hi>and put him into the Dungeon amongſt the Rogues and Felons.</hi> Thus <hi>G.

               </gap>ng it was, that Priſoners ſhould lie long in Jail, becauſe they learned Wickedneſs one of another, in talking of their bad Deeds; and that therefore ſpeedy Juſtice ought to be done.</p>
            <p>Now whilſt he was confined here, there was a young Woman in the Jail for robbing her Maſter of ſome Money; and ſhe being to be tried for her Life, he wrote concerning her to the Judge and Jury, ſhewing them, how contrary it was to the Law of God of old, to put People to Death for Stealing; and that it was an incumbent Duty to ſhew Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. But notwithſtanding his Writing ſo, ſhe was condemned to die, and a Grave was made for her. <hi>G.

            <p>In the Jail there was alſo detained a wicked Man, who was ſaid to be a Conjurer; this Man threatned <hi>G. Fox,</hi> and alſo the Jailor, <hi>That he would raiſe the Devil, and break the Houſe down;</hi> ſo that he made the

And coming afterwards into the Parts about <hi>Wakefield, James Naylor</hi> came to him, and alſo acknowledged the Truth of that Doctrine he held forth; likewiſe <hi>William Dewsbury,</hi> with many more; and theſe three named, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came in Time alſo Miniſters of the Goſpel. But by the way, I muſt ſay that <hi>William Dewsbury</hi> was one of thoſe that had already been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately convinced, as <hi>G.

               </note> and of theſe was alſo <hi>George Fox</hi> the Younger, of whom more hereafter. But I return to the other <hi>G.

               <hi>G. Fox</hi> ſpoke to the Congregation, and ſaid, that <hi>They ought to turn to Chriſt Jeſus as their Teacher.</hi> This ſtruck a Dread amongſt the People, and the Mayor ſpoke to him; but none meddled with him. In the Afternoon he went to another Steeple-houſe, about two Miles off, where, after the Prieſt had done, he ſpoke to him and the People, ſhewing them the Way of Life and Truth, and the Ground of Election and Reprobation. The Prieſt ſaying he could not diſpute, <hi>G. Fox</hi> told him, <q>He did not come to diſpute, but to hold forth the Word of Truth, that they might all know the one Seed, to which the Promiſe was, both in the Male, and in the Female.</q> Here his ſpeaking did ſo pleaſe the Auditory, that he was deſired to come again on another Day, and to preach there. But he directed them to their Teacher Chriſt Jeſus, and ſo went away. The next Day he came to <hi>Crantſick,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Crantſick. Capt. Purſloe.

Fox,</hi> told him, <q>He had known that Principle about ten Years, and was glad that the Lord did publiſh it abroad among the People.</q> While <hi>G. Fox</hi> was there, there came a great Woman of <hi>Beverly</hi> to ſpeak with the ſaid Juſtice about ſome Buſineſs, who in Diſcourſe ſaid, <q>That the laſt Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-Day (as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he called it) there was an Angel or Spirit came into the Church at <hi>Beverly,</hi> and ſpoke the wonderful Things of God, to the Aſtoniſhment of all that were there: And that when it had done, it paſſed away, they not knowing whence it came, nor whither it went; but it aſtoniſhed all, both Prieſt and Profeſſors, and the Magiſtrates of the Town.</q> This Relation Juſtice <hi>Hotham</hi> gave him afterwards; and then <hi>G. Fox</hi> told him, that it was he who had been that Day at <hi>Beverly</hi> Steeple-houſe, and had declar'd Truth there. The next firſt Day of the Week Captain <hi>Purſloe</hi> came to <hi>G. Fox,</hi> and they both went to the Steeple-houſe, where <hi>G. Fox,</hi> when the Prieſt had done, ſpoke to both Prieſt and People, and directed them where they might find their Teacher, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> inwardly, in their Hearts; which was of ſuch Effect, that ſome received that Doctrine of Truth, and continued in it. In the Afternoon he went to another Steeple-houſe, about three Miles off, where one preached that bore the Title of <hi>Doctor:</hi> He took his Text from <hi>Iſaiah</hi> LV. <hi>Every one that thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, come ye to the Waters, and he that hath no Money, come ye, buy and eat, yea come, buy Wine and Milk, without Money, without Price. G. Fox</hi> ſtaid till the Prieſt had done, and well knowing what kind of Teacher he was, he was kindled with ſuch a Zeal, that he ſaid, <hi>Come down thou Deceiver: Doſt thou bid People come freely, and take of the Water of Life freely, and yet thou takeſt three Hundred Pounds a Year of them! May'ſt not thou bluſh with Shame! Did the Prophet</hi> Iſaiah <hi>and Chriſt do ſo, who ſpake the Words, and gave them forth freely? Did not Chriſt ſay to his Miniſters, whom he ſent
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:003104_0055_0FEFF3774C54B148"/>
to preach, Freely ye have received, freely give?</hi> The Prieſt being amazed, haſtened away, and ſo gave <hi>G. Fox</hi> as much Time as he could deſire, to ſpeak to the People; who then directed them to the Light, and the Grace of God, and to the Spirit of God in their inward Parts, to be taught and inſtructed thereby.</p>
            <p>Having thus cleared himſelf amongſt that People, he return'd to Juſtice <hi>Hotham</hi>'s Houſe that Night, who embracing him, ſaid, <hi>My Houſe is your Houſe;</hi> and alſo ſignified, <hi>that he was exceeding glad at the Work of the Lord, and that his Power was revealed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From thence <hi>G. Fox</hi> went thro' the Country, and came at Night to an Inn, where he bid the Woman of the Houſe, if ſhe had any Meat, to bring him ſome. But becauſe he ſaid <hi>Thee</hi> and <hi>Thou</hi> to her, ſhe look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtrangely on him. Then he asked her, if ſhe had any Milk? and ſhe ſaid, <hi>No:</hi> He believing ſhe ſpoke falſely, and ſeeing a Churn ſtand in the Room, would try her farther, and asked h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r, <hi>If ſhe had any Cream?</hi> But ſhe denied that ſhe had any. Then a little Boy playing about the Churn, put his Hands into it, and pulling it down, threw all the Cream on the Floor. Thus the Woman appeared to be a Lyar, and ſhe being amazed, took up the Child, and whipt it ſorely: But he reproved her for her Lying, and going out of the Houſe, went away, and that Night lay in a
Stack of Hay,<note place="margin">York.</note> in Rain and Snow. The next Day he came to <hi>York;</hi> and the firſt Day of the Week being come, he went to the Cathedral: When the Prieſt had done, he ſaid, <hi>He had ſomething from the Lord God to ſpeak to the Prieſt and People.</hi> Then ſaid a Profeſſor, <hi>Say on quickly;</hi> for it was very cold Weather. Then <hi>G. Fox</hi> told them, <hi>This was the Word of the Lord God unto them, that they lived in Words; but God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty looked for Fruits among them.</hi> As ſoon as theſe Words were out of his Mouth, he was hurried out, and thrown down the Steps. But he got up again without Hurt, and went to his Lodging. Yet ſeveral of the People were ſo reach'd that they became convinced of the Truth.</p>
            <p>He having now done his Service in <hi>York,</hi> went from thence, and came the next Day to <hi>Burraby,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Burraby.</note> and coming into a certain Meeting, where there was a Prieſt alſo, he had Occaſion to declare the Truth, and many were convinced; and the Prieſt himſelf confeſſed to the Truth, tho' he came not to live up to it. The following Day <hi>G. Fox</hi> paſſed to <hi>Cleave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cleaveland.</note> where having a Meeting, ſome were convinced. The firſt Day of the next Week he went to the Steeple-houſe, and when the Prieſt had done, he directed the People to their Teacher w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <note place="margin">Stath.</note> where he had great Meetings, and many received the Truth he preached; amongſt whom was <hi>Philip Scarth</hi> a Prieſt,<note place="margin">P.

Fox</hi> viſited him at his Houſe. Not much unlike to this, was, that a Woman of Note among the <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents,</hi> being ſwayed by Prejudice againſt <hi>G Fox,</hi> ſaid, <hi>She would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly have gone to have ſeen him hang'd:</hi> But when ſhe heard him preach,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:003104_0056_0FEFF37A0D8891B0"/>
ſhe was ſo reach'd, that the being convinced of the Truth he declared, came to be one of his Friends. Oftentimes he had Opportunity to ſpeak with the Prieſts, who, when they heard of his coming, would hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for it was a dreadful Thing to them, when it was told them, <hi>The Man in Leather Breeches is come;</hi> for this was indeed his D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>He now coming to <hi>Malton,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Malton.</note> had great Meetings; but it was thought ſuch a ſtrange Thing to preach in Houſes, that many du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſt not come there, for Fear of their Relations; and therefore he was much deſired to come and preach in the Churches, as the Steeple-houſes are commonly called:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prieſt</hi> Boyes.</note> Nay, one of the Prieſts himſelf, called <hi>Boyes,</hi> (who was ſo taken with him, that he called him Brother) did invite him to preach in his Steeple-houſe: But <hi>G.

He alſo directed the People to their inward Teacher, Chriſt Jeſus, who would turn them from Darkneſs to Light: And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving opened divers Scriptures to them, he directed them to the Spirit of God in themſelves, by which they might come to God, and alſo come to know who the falſe Prophets were.

Fox,</hi> who was unwilling to let any Opportunity ſlip, without admoniſhing People to Vertue, warned the Juſtice to <hi>repent,</hi> and bid him <q>Come to the Light which Chriſt had enlightned him with, that by it he might ſee all his evil Words and Actions, and ſo return to Chriſt Jeſus whilſt he had Time, and that he ought to prize that Time.</q> 
               <hi>Ay, Ay,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>the Light that is ſpoken of in the Third of</hi> John. <hi>G. Fox</hi> deſired him that he would mind it, and obey it; and laying his Hand upon, him, he was ſo brought down by the Lord's Power, that all the Watchmen ſtood amazed. Then he took <hi>G. Fox</hi> with him into a Parlour with the other Men, and deſired to ſee what he had in his Pockets, of Letters, or Intelligence; for it ſeems they ſuſpected him to be an Enemy to the Common-wealth. Then he pulled out his Linnen, and ſhewed that he had no Letters; which made the Juſtice ſay, <hi>He is not a Vagrant, by his Linnen;</hi> and ſet him at Liberty. Then <hi>G. Fox</hi> went back, to <hi>Patrington</hi> again, with that Man who had rid before to the Juſtice, and who lived in that Town. Coming to his Houſe, he deſired <hi>G.

            <p>When the Firſt Day of the Week was come, he went to the Steeple-houſe, and declared the Doctrine of Truth to the Prieſt and People, without being mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

had not given him Lodging when he was there before. From thence he travelled thro' the Country, warning People, both in Towns, and in Country-Villages, to <hi>repent,</hi> and turn to Chriſt Jeſus their Teacher.</p>
            <p>On a Firſt Day of the Week he came to one Colonel <hi>Overton</hi>'s Houſe,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Col.</hi> Overton.</note> and had a great Meeting of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ef of the People of that Country; where he opened many Things out of the Scriptures, which they never heard before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Coming afterwards again to <hi>Patrington,</hi> he underſtood that a Taylor, and ſome wild Blades in that Town, had occaſioned his being carried before the Juſtice: This Taylor came to ask him For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, fearing he would complain of him: The Conſtables alſo were afraid, leſt he ſhould trouble them: But he forgave them all, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them to turn to the Lord, and to amend their Lives. Now that which made them the more afraid, was, that he having been not long before in the Steeple-houſe at <hi>Oram,</hi> there came a Profeſſor that gave him a Puſh on the Breaſt, and bid him, <hi>Get out of the Church.</hi> To which <hi>G. Fox</hi> ſaid, <hi>Doſt thou call the Steeple-houſe the Church? The Church is the People, whom God hath purchaſed with his Blood, and not the Houſe.</hi> But Juſtice <hi>Hotham</hi> having heard of this Man's thus abuſing <hi>G. Fox,</hi>

               </gap>t a Warrant, and bound the ſaid Man over to the Seſſions. So zealous was this Juſtice to keep the Peace, that he had asked <hi>G. Fox</hi> before, whether any People had abuſed him: But he eſteeming it his Duty to forgive all, told him nothing of that Kind.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Patrington</hi> he went to ſeveral great Mens Houſes, warning them to repent. Some received him lovingly, and ſome ſlighted him. Paſſing thus thro' the Country, at Night he came to another Town, where he deſired Lodging and Meat, offering to pay for it; but they would not lodge him, unleſs he went to a Conſtable to ask Leave, which they ſaid was the Cuſtom of Strangers. But he told them, <hi>That Cuſtom was for ſuſpected Perſons, and not for ſuch as he, who was an innocent Man.</hi> So after he had warned them to repent, and to mind the Day of their Viſitation, and directed them to me Light of Chriſt, and Spirit of God, he paſſed away. As it grew dark, he ſpied an Hay-ſtack, and went and ſat under it till Morning. The next Day he came to <hi>Hull,</hi> where he admoniſhed the People to turn to Chriſt Jeſus, that they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Salvation. And being very weary with travelling on Foot ſo far, he got that Night a Lodging there.</p>
            <p>From thence he went to <hi>Nottinghamſhire,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Nottingham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire. Lincolnſhire.

Fox</hi> kindled with Zeal, ſtept upon the Table, and ſaid to the People, <hi>That Chriſt was in them, except they were Reprobates; and that it was Chriſt the eternal Power of God, that ſpoke in him at that Time unto them; not that he was Chriſt.</hi> This gave general Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, except to the falſe Accuſer himſelf, to whom <hi>G. Fox</hi> ſaid, <hi>That he was a</hi> Judas, <hi>and that</hi> Judas<hi>'s End ſhould be his; and that</hi> That <hi>was the Word of the Lord thro' him</hi> [Fox] <hi>to him.</hi> The Minds of the People com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus to be quieted, they departed peaceably. But very remarkable it was, <hi>This</hi> Judas <hi>ſhortly after hanged himſelf, and a Stake was driven into his Grave.</hi> Now tho' this was a well known Thing in this Country, yet ſome Prieſts ſpread a Report, <hi>That a</hi> Quaker <hi>had hanged himſelf in</hi> Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colnſhire,
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:003104_0061_0FEFF386E980CD38"/>
               <hi>and had a Stake driven thro' him.</hi> And tho' this was taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Truſt by Hearſay, yet, out of meer Malice, a certain Prieſt gave out this Falſhood in Print, as a true Matter. But this wicked Slander prevailed ſo little, that many People in <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> were convinced of the Truth preached by <hi>G. Fox.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this he paſſed into <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi>

In the Afternoon he went to another Steeple-houſe; but the Sermon was finiſhed before he got thither; ſo he preached Repentance to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that were not departed, and directed them to their inward Teacher, Chriſt Jeſus.<note place="margin">Doncaſter.</note> From hence he came to <hi>Doncaſter,</hi> where he had formerly preached in the Market; but now on the Firſt Day of the Week he went into the Steeple-houſe; and after the Prieſt had done, he began to ſpeak, but was hurried out, and haled before the Magiſtrates, who threatned him with Death, if ever he came thither again. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this, <hi>G. Fox</hi> bid them <hi>Mind the Light of Chriſt in them,</hi> ſaying, <hi>That God was come to teach his People himſelf, whether they would hear or not.</hi> After a while being put out with ſome of his Friends, that were with him, they were ſtoned by the rude Multitude. A certain Innkeeper, that was a Bailiff, ſeeing this, came and took them into his Houſe, but one of the Stones, that were thrown, hit his Head, ſo that the Blood ran down his Face. The next Firſt Day <hi>G. Fox</hi> went to <hi>Tichhil,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tichhil.</note> where he went into the Steeple-houſe, and there found the Prieſt, and the Chief of the Pariſh in the Chancel, to whom he began to ſpeak; but they immediately fell upon him, and the Clark ſtruck him with his Bible ſo violently on the Face, that the Blood guſhed out, and he bled exceedingly. Then the People thruſt him out of the Steeple-Houſe, and beating him, threw him down, and dragged him along the Street, ſo that he became beſmeared with Blood and Dirt, and his Hat was taken away. When he was got up again, he ſpoke to the People, and ſhewed them how they diſhonoured Chriſtianity. Some Time after the Prieſt coming by, ſcoſſingly called <hi>G. Fox</hi> and his Friends, <hi>Quakers.</hi> But he was ſpoken to, in ſuch an Authority and Dread, that he fell a trembling; which made one of the People ſay, <hi>Look how the Prieſt trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and ſhakes, he is turned a</hi> Quaker <hi>alſo.</hi> Some moderate Juſtices now, hearing how <hi>G. Fox</hi> and his Friends had been abuſed, came to examine the Buſineſs; and the <hi>Clark</hi> was afraid of having his Hand cut off, for ſtriking him in the Church: But <hi>G. Fox,</hi> as a true Chriſtian, forgave him, and would not appear againſt him.</p>
            <p>Thus far <hi>G.

               <hi>viz.

made them follow him.</hi> And <hi>that he rid upon a great black Horſe, and was ſeen in one Country upon that Horſe, and in the ſame Hour in an other Country threeſcore Miles off.</hi> But theſe horrid Lies were ſo far from turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Prieſt's Advantage, that he preached many of his Hearers away from him; for it was well known, that <hi>G. Fox</hi> had no Horſe at that Time, but travelled on Foot. He coming now into a Steeple-houſe not far from <hi>Bradford,</hi> the Prieſt took his Text from <hi>Jer.</hi> V. 31. <hi>My People love to have it ſo;</hi> leaving out the foregoing Words, <hi>The Prophets propheſy falſely, and the Prieſts bear Rule by their Means. G. Fox</hi> unwilling to let this paſs unregarded, ſhewed the People the Prieſt's unfair Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and directing them to Chriſt, the true inward Teacher, declared, That <hi>God was come to teach his People himſelf, and to bring them off from all the World's Teachers and Hirelings, that they might come to receive freely from him;</hi> concluding his Speech with a Warning of the Day of the Lord that was coming upon all Fleſh. He paſſed from thence without much Oppoſition, and travelled now for ſome Time with <hi>Richard Farnſworth,</hi> with whom he once paſſed a Night in the open Field, on a Bed they made of Fern.</p>
            <p>Then parting from him,<note place="margin">Wentzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale.</note> he came to <hi>Wentzerdale,</hi> where he went into the Steeple-houſe; and after the Lecture, he ſpoke to the People much in the ſame Terms as he uſed to do on the like Occaſions; and had not much Oppoſition there. Thus he went from Place to Place, and often met with ſtrange Occurrences, ſome of which were more jocoſe than ſerious; others very rude, and even dangerous to his Life. But he truſted in God, really believing that he had ſent him to preach Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and to exhort People to a true Converſion.</p>
            <p>Thus travelling on,<note place="margin">Sedburgh. <hi>Juſt.</hi> Benſon.</note> he came near <hi>Sedburgh;</hi> there he went to a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Juſtice <hi>Benſon</hi>'s, where a People met that were ſeparated from the publick Worſhip; and by his Preaching, he gave ſuch general Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that moſt of the Hearers were convinc'd of the Truth declared by him. Thus the Number of his Fellow-Believers increaſed ſo, that now they had Meetings by themſelves, in many Places of the Country. About this Time there being a Fair at <hi>Sedburgh, G. Fox</hi> declared the Day of the Lord thro the Fair; and afterwards went into the Steeple-houſe-Yard, where Abundance of People came to him: Here he preached for ſeveral Hours, ſhewing, <q>That the Lord was come to teach his People himſelf, and to bring them off from all the World's Ways, and Teachers, to Chriſt, the true Teacher, and the true Way to God. Moreover, he ſhewed the declining State of the modern Doctors and Teachers; and exhorted the People to come off from the Temples made with Hands, and wait to receive the Spirit of the Lord, that they might know themſelves to be the Temples of God.</q> None of the Prieſts, ſeveral of whom were there, ſpoke againſt what he had declared; but a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſaid, <hi>Why will you not go into the Church; for this is not a fit Place to preach in? G. Fox</hi> told him, <hi>That he did not approve of their Church.</hi> Then ſtood up one <hi>Francis Howgil,</hi>

At this People wondered, becauſe they look'd upon the Church (ſo called) as an holy Place, requiſite for Worſhip. But <hi>G. Fox</hi> told them afterwards, <hi>That the Ground whereon he ſtood, was as good as that of the Steeple-houſe;</hi> beſides, we find, that Chriſt himſelf did preach on a Mountain, and alſo at the Sea-Side. Now in the Afternoon the People gathered about him, with ſeveral of their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and amongſt theſe, <hi>F. Howgil,</hi> and <hi>J. Audland.</hi> To this Auditory, which was judged to conſiſt of more than a thouſand People, <hi>G. Fox</hi> began to preach, and ſpoke about the Space of three Hours, directing all <q>To the Spirit of God in themſelves, that ſo they might be turned from Darkneſs to Light, and from the Power of Satan, which they had been under, unto God; by which they ſhould become Children of the Light, and, by the Spirit of Truth, be led into all Truth, and ſo ſenſibly underſtand the Words of the Prophets, of Chriſt, and of the Apoſtles; and come to know Chriſt to be their Teacher to inſtruct them; their Counſellor to direct them, their Shepherd to feed them, their Biſhop to overſee them, and their Prophet to open divine Myſteries to them; that ſo their Bodies might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, ſanctify'd, and made fit Temples for God and Chriſt to dwell in. Moreover, he explained the Prophets, and the Figures, and Shadows, and directed his Hearers to Chriſt the Subſtance. He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo opened the Parables and Sayings of Chriſt, and ſhewed the Intent and Scope of the Apoſtles Writings, and Epiſtles to the Elect. Then he ſpoke alſo concerning the State of the Apoſtacy, that hath been ſince the Apoſtles Days; how the Prieſts had gotten the Scripture, without being in that Spirit which gave them forth; and how they were found in the Steps of the falſe Prophets, Scribes, and Phariſees of old, and were ſuch as the true Prophets, Chriſt, and his Apoſtles cried againſt; inſomuch, that none that were guided by the Spirit of God now, could own them.</q> Whilſt <hi>G. Fox</hi> was thus preaching, many old People went into the Chappel, and looked out at the Windows, thinking it a ſtrange Thing to ſee a Man preach on a Hill, and not in the Church (as they called it.) He perceiving this, ſaid, <q>That the Steeple-houſe, and the Ground whereon it ſtood, was no more holy than that Hill; and that thoſe Temples, which they called the dreadful Houſes of God, were not ſet up by the Command of God and Chriſt: nor their Prieſts inſtituted, as <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Prieſthood was; nor their Tythes appointed by God, as thoſe amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> were. But that Chriſt was come, who ended both the Temple, and its Worſhip, and the Prieſts and their Tythes; and that therefore all ought to hearken unto him; for he ſaid, <hi>Learn of me;</hi> and God ſaid of him, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed; hear ye him.</hi> In Concluſion, he ſaid, That the Lord God had ſent him to preach the Everlaſting Goſpel, and Word of Life amongſt them; and to bring them off from all theſe Temples, Tythes, Prieſts, and Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the World, which were gotten up ſince the Apoſtles Days,
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:003104_0064_0FEFF3900A8BB500"/>
and had been ſet up by ſuch as had erred from the Spirit and Power the Apoſtles were in.</q>

            <p>After this Meeting was over, <hi>G.

               </note> When he was but ſeventeen or eighteen Years old, he was very religious, and a zealous Searcher of the Holy Scriptures and having a good Underſtanding, and ſtrong Memory, he thereby gathered a large Treaſure of Scripture-Learning, became an eminent Teacher a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Independents,</hi> and had a very numerous Auditory. But when he heard <hi>G. Fox</hi> preach, he was thereby ſo reached to the Heart, that he began in Proceſs of Time to ſee the Emptineſs of his great Literal Knowledge, and that all his Righteouſneſs was but as filthy Raggs. This brought him to a State of Mourning; for now he ſaw that all his Profeſſion and Wiſdom could not bring him to true Happineſs. But the Lord, who doth <hi>not break the bruiſed Reed, nor quench the ſmoaking Flax,</hi> did pity him in this State of deep Humiliation, and bore him up again by his ſupporting Power; whereby in Time he came to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to that Service he was appointed to by God.</p>
            <p>Concerning <hi>Francis Howgil;</hi>
               <note place="margin">And of <hi>F. Howgil.</hi>
               </note> he was alſo a religious Man, who having ſeen the Superſtitions of the Epiſcopal Church, had left it, and applied himſelf to the <hi>Independents.</hi> But altho' he, who had been trained up in the Univerſity to be a Miniſter, became a Teacher amongſt the <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents,</hi> and was zealous in Vertue; yet he remained diſſatisfy'd in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, finding, that notwithſtanding all his Faſting, Praying, and good Works, the Root of Sin ſtill remained in him: And altho' the common Doctrine was, that Chriſt had taken the Guilt of Sin upon himſelf, yet this could not ſatisfy him; becauſe his Conſcience told him, <hi>His Servant thou art, whom thou obeyeſt.</hi> Thus encreaſing in Underſtanding, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to him, that the Lord, according to what the Prophets had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, would teach his People himſelf; and it ſeemed alſo to him, that this Time was near at Hand. Some while after it happened, as hath been ſaid already, that he was preſent when <hi>G. Fox</hi> preach'd, and when he heard him ſay, That <hi>the Light of Chriſt in Man was the Way to Chriſt,</hi> he believed this to be the Word of Truth; and he ſaw how he had been ignorant of the Principle of true Religion. Submitting then to the Reproofs of this inward Light, he ſaw the Unfruitfulneſs of all his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; and Anguiſh and Sorrow ſeized on him; and Judgment went over all his former Actions: But he being given up, and reſign'd in that State, ſaying with himſelf, <hi>Thou, O God, art juſt in all thy Judgments,</hi> it pleaſed the Lord in due Time to fill his Heart with Joy, and to make him a Miniſter of his Everlaſting Word. But no ſooner did he enter into that Service, but both Prieſts and Magiſtrates, of whom he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had been beloved, became his Enemies; and Envy was ſo kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

againſt him, that he was lock'd up in a naſty Place, at <hi>Appleby</hi> in <hi>Weſtmorland,</hi> and was kept there Priſoner for ſome Time.</p>
            <p>But let me now return to <hi>G. Fox,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Appleby <hi>in</hi> Weſtmorland Kendal.</note> who coming to <hi>Kendal,</hi> had a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there in the Town-Hall, where declaring the Word of Life, he ſhewed the People, <q>How they might come to the ſaving Knowledge of Chriſt, and to have a right Underſtanding of the Holy Scripture; opening to them what it was that would lead them into the Way of Reconciliation with God.</q> This was of ſuch Effect, that ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral became convinced of the Truth publiſhed by him; and others were ſo well affected to him,<note place="margin">Under-Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</note> that when he went to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder-Barrow,</hi> ſeveral Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple accompanied him, and he had great Reaſonings with them, but eſpecially with one <hi>Edward Burrough,</hi>
               <note place="margin">E. Burrough.</note> who, tho' of extraordinary Parts, and acquired Knowledge, was not able to withſtand the efficacious Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of <hi>G. Fox.</hi> And becauſe this <hi>Burrough</hi> became an eminent Man among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſo called, being endued with Courage and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, fit to overcome his Oppoſers, and to break even ſtony Hearts, I'll mention here a little of his Deſcent and Quality.</p>
            <p>He was born in the Barony of <hi>Kendal</hi> in <hi>Weſtmorland,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter.</note> of Parents, who for their honeſt and vertuous Life, were in good Repute; he was well educated, and train'd up in ſuch Learning as that Country did afford. His Knowledge and Underſtanding ſoon paſſed his Years; for being but a Boy, he had the Spirit of a Man, and in his Youth was endued with Wiſdom above his Equals in Years: Moreover, he was very religious, converſing frequently with thoſe that were in Eſteem for their Piety and godly Life. Neither was he inclined to the ordinary Pleaſures of Youth; but it was his Delight to be exerciſed in reading of the Holy Scripture, wherein he was well verſed. By his Parents he was trained up in the Epiſcopal Worſhip; yet when but twelve Years of Age, he often went to the Meeting of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> becauſe their Doctrine in many Things ſeemed to him to approach nearer to Truth, than that of the publick Church; wherefore he became a Follower of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> altho' he was reviled for it by his Acquaintance. But being come to the Age of about ſeventeen Years, and growing more and more ſenſible of his own Condition, he was often ſtruck with Terror, and when he had been praying, he heard, as it were, a Voice, <hi>Thou art ignorant of God; thou knoweſt not where he is, nor what he is: To what Purpoſe is thy Prayer?</hi> This brought him under ſuch a Concern, that he began to take diligent Heed to his Life, ſo that he abſtained not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from all Vanities, but when Occaſion offer'd, he reproved others for their vain Converſation and Wickedneſs; but becauſe of this, he was derided, and looked upon ſcornfully by many; yet continued to live religiouſly, and felt ſometimes ſweet Refreſhments to his Soul. But tho' he had the Truth in his Comprehenſion, yet he wanted the real and experimental Knowledge of it, and ſo became darkned again, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing what he once poſſeſſed: And being too ready to flatter himſelf, would ſay, <hi>Whom God loves once, he loves for ever.</hi> Now he grew weary of hearing any of the Prieſts, for he ſaw they did not poſſeſs what they ſpoke of to others; and ſometimes he began to queſtion his own Experiences. Being thus many Times put to a Stand, he ſeem'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to be at a Loſs. In this Condition he heard <hi>G. Fox</hi> preach, and afterwards reaſoned with him; and it pleaſed the Lord ſo to open his Underſtanding, that he perceived (as he relates himſelf) that he was in the prodigal State, above the Croſs of Chriſt, and not in the pure Fear of the Lord. Being thus convinced, he entred into the Society of the deſpiſed <hi>Quakers,</hi> tho' he was now rejected by his Relations, and by a blind Zeal, turn'd out of his Father's Houſe. This he bore
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:003104_0066_0FEFF394147E79A8"/>
patiently, and continued faithful in the Doctrine he had embraced. And in Proceſs of Time he ſo advanced in true Knowledge, that he became a very eminent Miniſter of the Goſpel. But what Adverſities did he not undergo! Reviling, Slandering, Buffeting, and Caning was often his Lot; Watching and Faſting were many Times his Portion; and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, great Jeopardies, and Danger of Life, he was not unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with. But nothing could make this Hero ſhrink: He always was laborious, and ſeldom had any Hours of Reſt. In his Preaching he was very acceptable, and eloquent in his Speech, and had the Tongue (according to what an eminent Author relates, that knew him from his Youth) of a learned Orator, to declare himſelf to the Underſtandings and Conſciences of all Men he met with. He was alſo a great Writer, and often would engage in Diſputes with thoſe of other Perſwaſions, ſparing no Pains where he thought he could ſerve the Lord, and the Church. Thus much for this Time of <hi>E. Burrough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let's return now to <hi>G. Fox,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Under-Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</note> whom we left at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder-Barrow,</hi> where, with the Conſent of the Inhabitants, he had a great Meeting in the Chappel, and many were convinced, and received the Truth preached by him. From thence he went to <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> and having in ſome Places ſpoken in the Steeple-houſes,<note place="margin">Ulverſtone. Swarthmore. <hi>Judge</hi> Fell.</note> he came to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lverſtone,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Swarth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> to the Houſe of <hi>Thomas Fell,</hi> a Judge in <hi>Wales,</hi> where many Prieſts frequently came. The Judge was at that Time abroad, employ'd in the Exerciſe of his Office; and his Wife <hi>Margaret</hi> was alſo gone abroad that Day. <hi>G. Fox</hi> in the mean while coming thither, met the Prieſt <hi>William Lampitt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">W. Lampitt.</note> who was a high Notioniſt, and rich in Words. But <hi>G. Fox</hi> ſoon perceiving that he was without the Poſſeſſion of what he profeſſed, oppoſed him boldly. Before it was Night <hi>Margaret Fell</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home, and her Children told her, That <hi>Lampitt</hi> and <hi>Fox</hi> had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreed, which did ſomewhat trouble her, for the making much of the Prieſts, eſpecially admired <hi>Lampitt.</hi> That ſame Night <hi>G. Fox</hi> had much Reaſoning there, and declared the Truth to her and her Family. The next Day <hi>Lampitt</hi> came again, and <hi>G. Fox</hi> diſcourſed with him in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of <hi>Margaret Fell,</hi> who then began clearly to diſcern the Prieſt. The following Day being appointed for an Humiliation, <hi>Margaret</hi> went with her Children to the Steeple-houſe at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lverſtone,</hi> having asked <hi>G. Fox</hi> before to go with her: But he replying, That <hi>he muſt do as he was ordered by the Lord,</hi> left her, and walked into the Fields; and there he felt a ſtrong Motion to go alſo to the Steeple-houſe. When he came there the People were ſinging, but what they ſung was, according to his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, altogether unſuitable to their States. After they had done, he ſtept up on a Form, and asked Leave to ſpeak: The Prieſt conſenting, <hi>G. Fox</hi> began thus: <hi>He is not a</hi> Jew <hi>that is one outwardly; neither is that Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is outward: But he is a</hi> Jew <hi>that is one inwardly; and that is Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion which is of the Heart.</hi> And ſo he went on, and ſaid, <q>That Chriſt was the Light of the World, and enlighteneth every Man that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into the World, and that by this Light they might be gathered to God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               </gap>, wondered at this Doctrine, having never heard any ſuch before. In the mean while <hi>G. Fox</hi> went on, and opening the Scriptures ſaid, <q>That they were the Prophet's Words, and Chriſt's, and the Apoſtle's Words; and that what they ſpoke, they enjoyed and poſſeſſed, and had it from the Lord.</q> 
               <hi>What have any to do,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>with the Scriptures, if they come not to the Spirit that gave them forth? You will ſay,</hi> Chriſt <hi>ſaith this, and the Apoſtles ſay this; but what canſt thou, O Man, ſay thy ſelf concerning this? Art thou a Child of the Light? Doſt thou walk in the Light? And what thou ſpeakeſt, is it inwardly from God?</hi> He ſhewed alſo, <q>That God was come
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:003104_0067_0FEFF39795674750"/>
to teach his People himſelf, by his Spirit, and to bring them off from their Churches, and Religions, and their Ways of Worſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> Theſe his Words did ſo effectually reach the aforeſaid <hi>Margaret,</hi> that ſhe ſate down in her Pew again, and weeping bitterly, cried in her Spirit to the Lord, <hi>We are all Thieves! We are all Thieves! We have taken the Scriptures in Words, and know nothing of them in our ſelves. G. Fox</hi> ſtill going on, declared againſt the falſe Prophets, and ſaid, <q>That their Way of Worſhip was but talking of other Mens Words, and that they themſelves were out of the Life and Spirit, which thoſe were in who gave them forth.</q> Then cried out a Juſtice of Peace, call'd <hi>John Sawrey, Take him away:</hi>
               <note place="margin">J.

G. Fox</hi> then ſpeaking yet a while, was at length led out by the Conſtable, according to the Order of the ſaid Juſtice <hi>Sawrey;</hi> and then he ſpoke to the People in the Grave-Yard. In the Evening he came again into the Houſe of Judge <hi>Fell,</hi> where he took Occaſion to ſpeak to the Servants, and thoſe of the Family, who moſt of them came ſo effectually to be convinced by him, that they embraced the Truth which he preached. Among theſe was alſo <hi>William Caton,</hi>
               <note place="margin">W. Caton.</note> of whom more hereafter. <hi>Margaret Fell</hi> in the mean while being come home, was ſo reached, that ſhe ſcarce kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>w what to do, her Husband being from home; for ſhe clearly perceived what ſhe had heard <hi>G. Fox</hi> preach, was Truth. The Firſt Day after he went to <hi>Aldenham</hi>-Steeple-houſe,<note place="margin">Aldenham.</note> where, when the Prieſt had done, he ſpoke to the People, and admoniſhed them to return to the Lord. From thence he went to <hi>Ram-ſide,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ram-ſide.</note> where was a Chappel, in which one <hi>Thomas Lawſon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">T. Lawſon.</note> who was an eminent Prieſt, uſed to preach; who having ſome Notice of <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s coming, preach'd in the Morning, and told his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that <hi>G. Fox</hi> was to come there in the Afternoon; by which Means very many People were gathered together. When he came, he ſaw there was no Place ſo convenient to ſpeak to the People, as the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and therefore he went into it. The Prieſt <hi>Lawſon</hi> willing to give a full Opportunity to <hi>G. Fox,</hi> went not up into the Pulpit, but left all the Time to him. And <hi>G. Fox</hi> ſo powerfully declared the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Truth, that many receiv'd it, and among thoſe the Prieſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who left off his preaching for Hire, and in Proceſs of Time came to preach the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and his glorious Goſpel freely; which however did not hinder him to exerciſe himſelf in the Knowledge of Herbs, wherein he came to be ſo experienc'd, that he was, as I have been told, one of the moſt skilful Herbaliſts in <hi>England;</hi> which gave Occaſion to an eminent Botaniſt, who at firſt ſeem'd a little ſhy of him, when he perceiv'd his great Skill, to love him as a ſingular Friend. But this tranſiently.</p>
            <p>Now I return again to <hi>G. Fox,</hi> who having perform'd his Service about <hi>Ram-ſide,</hi> went ſomewhere elſe, and came alſo to <hi>Becliff,</hi> where he found ſome People that told him,<note place="margin">Beclif.</note> 
               <hi>They could not diſpute<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> But he bid them <q>to fear the Lord, and not to ſpeak the Words of God in an airy Manner, but do the Things required. Moreover, that they ought to mind the Light of Chriſt, and take heed to his Spirit in their Hearts, whereby they would come to ſee their evil Thoughts, Words, and Actions; for this Light (he ſaid) would ſhew them their Sins, and by following this Light, they ſhould alſo ſee that their Saviour Chriſt Jeſus ſaved them from Sin: And, he ſaid, the firſt Step to Peace was to ſtand ſtill in the Light, which ſhewed them their Sins and Tranſgreſſions; by which they ſhould ſee they were in the Fall of the old <hi>Adam,</hi> in Darkneſs and Death, alienated from
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:003104_0068_0FEFF39A57C1E8C0"/>
the Covenant of the Promiſe, and without God in the World; and that Chriſt who died for them, was their Saviour and Redeemer, and their Way to God.</q> After <hi>G. Fox</hi> had ſpoken thus, he went to a new built Chappel near <hi>Gleaſton,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gleaſton.</note> wherein none had yet preached. Hither came a great many People, unto whom he preached, and many were convinced. From thence he returned to <hi>Swarthmore</hi> again: For <hi>Margaret Fell</hi> being full of Fear,<note place="margin">Marg. Fell.</note> and expecting her Husband's Return home, had deſired <hi>G.

               </gap>d him, <hi>That a great Diſaſter had befallen his Family; and that the</hi> Quakers <hi>were Witches, and had turned them from their Religion; and that he muſt ſend them away, or all the Country would be undone.</hi> Without all Queſtion this was a very ſad Meſſage to Judge <hi>Fell,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Judge <hi>Fell.</hi>
               </note> for he came home greatly offended: And one may eaſily think what a Condition his Wife was in, being in Fear, that ſhe ſhould either diſpleaſe her Husband, or offend God. At that Time <hi>Richard Farnſworth</hi> and <hi>James Naylor</hi> were at her Houſe,<note place="margin">R. Farnſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, <hi>and</hi> James Nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor.</note> and ſhe deſired them to ſpeak to her Husband; which they did very moderately and wiſely. And tho' at firſt he was diſpleaſed, yet after he had heard them ſpeak, he was better ſatisfied. And they making as if they would go away, ſhe deſired them to ſtay, becauſe ſhe expected <hi>G. Fox</hi> that Evening; and ſhe wiſhed for an Opportunity, that both he and they might ſpeak to her Husband, whereby he might ſatisfy himſelf farther about them. Dinner in the mean Time being ready, Judge <hi>Fell,</hi> and his Wife <hi>Margaret,</hi> ſat down at Table, and whilſt they were ſitting, an extraordinary Power ſeizing on her, made ſuch an Operation on her Mind, that he was ſtruck with Amazement, and knew not what to think of it; but he was quiet and ſtill; and the Children alſo were become ſo grave and modeſt, that they could not play on their Muſick they were learning. At Night <hi>G. Fox</hi> came, and Judge <hi>Fell</hi> ſitting in the Parlour, <hi>Margaret</hi> asked him, <hi>If</hi> G. Fox <hi>might come in;</hi> and he ſaid, <hi>Yes. George</hi> then coming in without any Compliment, began to ſpeak pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently; at which the Family, as well as <hi>J. Naylor</hi> and <hi>R.

He now ſpeaking, <q>declared what the Practice of Chriſt and the Apoſtles was in their Day; and ſhewed how the Apoſtacy came in ſince; and what was the Practice of the modern Prieſts in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy.</q> He alſo anſwer'd all the Objections of Judge <hi>Fell,</hi> and ſo thoroughly ſatisfy'd him by the Scriptures, that he was convinced in his Judgment,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Juſtice</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binſon.</note> and asked, <hi>If he was that</hi> George Fox <hi>whom Juſtice</hi> Robin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>had ſpoken ſo much in Commendation of amongſt many of the Parliament Men?</hi> To this <hi>G. Fox</hi> anſwered him, <hi>That he had been with the Juſtices</hi> Robinſon <hi>and</hi> Hotham <hi>in</hi> Yorkſhire; <hi>that they had been very civil and loving to him, and that they were convinced in their Judgments by the Spirit of God, that the Principle he bore Teſtimony to, was the Truth; and that they ſaw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Prieſts of the Nation.</hi> All this ſo ſatisfied Judge <hi>Fell,</hi> that he was very quiet that Night, and went to Bed. The next Morning came <hi>Lampitt,</hi> the Prieſt of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lverſtone,</hi> and walking with the Judge into the Garden, ſpoke much to him there, to render the Doctrine of the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> odious to him, having alſo ſaid to others, that <hi>G. Fox</hi> held ſtrange Notions. But Judge <hi>Fell</hi> had ſeen the Night before ſo much, that the Prieſt got little Entrance upon him.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prieſt</hi> Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitt.</note> And when <hi>Lampitt</hi> came into the Houſe again, <hi>G. Fox</hi> ſpoke ſharply to him, and asked him, <hi>When God ſpake to him, and called him to preach to the People?</hi> The Prieſt not liking ſuch Queſtions, it was not long before he went away. Now whilſt ſome were ſpeaking how ſeveral in thoſe Parts were convinced of the Truth now declared, and that they knew not where to get a Meeting-Place; Judge <hi>Fell</hi> hearing them, ſaid of his own Accord, <hi>You may meet in my
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:003104_0069_0FEFF39C88771D40"/>
Hall if you will.</hi> So the next Firſt Day there was at his Houſe a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a large one indeed, being the firſt Meeting of the People cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Quakers,</hi> that was at <hi>Swarthmore;</hi> and ſo it continued to be kept there until the Year 1690, when a new Meeting-houſe was built there. Judge <hi>Fell</hi> not being willing to appear in that Meeting, went that Day to the Steeple-houſe, and none with him but his Clerk and his Groom. Yet in Proceſs of Time he came to be ſo well affected to the Doctrine of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſo called, that tho' he did not enter publickly into their Society, yet he loved them, and ſeveral Years before his Death, he did not frequent the Steeple-houſe any more.</p>
            <p>After <hi>G. Fox</hi> had ſtayed ſome Days at the Houſe of Judge <hi>Fell,</hi> he went to <hi>Lancaſter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lancaſter.</note> and there preached in the Market; and on the next Firſt Day, he had a great Meeting in the Street, amongſt the Soldiers, to whom he declared the Truth; and in the Afternoon went to the Steeple-Houſe: But ſpeaking there, and directing People to the Spirit of God, he was haled out, and ſtoned along the Street. And after having travelled about ſome Time, and preached in ſome Places, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with rude Oppoſition, he returned to <hi>Swarthmore,</hi> where diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing with ſeveral Prieſts at Judge <hi>Fell</hi>'s Houſe, he asked them, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any of them ever heard the Voice of God or Chriſt, commanding them to go to any People, and declare the Word of the Lord to them?</hi> But none of them anſwered this with <hi>Yea:</hi> Yet one ſaying, <hi>I can ſpeak of my Experience as much as you; G. Fox</hi> told him, <hi>Experience was one Thing, but to go with a Meſſage, and to have the Word of the Lord, as the Prophets and Apoſtles had, was quite another.</hi>
               <note place="margin">T. Taylor.</note> An ancient Prieſt, whoſe Name was <hi>Thomas Taylor</hi> did ingenuouſly confeſs before Judge <hi>Fell, That he had never heard the Voice of God, nor of Chriſt,</hi> but that he ſpoke his Experiences, and the Experiences of the Saints in former Ages. This very much confirm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d Judge <hi>Fell</hi> in the Perſuaſion he had already, that the Prieſts were not what they pretended to be: For he had thought, as the Generality of the People did then, That th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> were ſent from God. At this Time the Saying of <hi>G. Fox</hi> wrought ſo cloſe on the Mind of the ſaid <hi>T.

               <hi>T. Taylor</hi>'s Mouth was opened, ſo that he declared amongſt the People, how he had been before he was convinced; and like the good <hi>Scribe,</hi> brought forth Things new and old from his Treaſury, to the People; and ſhewed them how the Prieſts were out of the Way.</p>
            <p>Now a great Rage aroſe among the Prieſts, and they began as much as they could, to ſtir up to Perſecution; for not only <hi>T. Taylor</hi> after ſome Time preach'd the Goſpel freely, but ſeveral others, viz. <hi>John Audland,</hi>

               <hi>Francis Howgil, John Cam, Edward Burrough, Richard Hubberthorn, Miles Halhead,</hi> and others, appeared zealous Preachers among thoſe called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and often declared the Doctrine they profeſſed in Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-houſes, and Markets, whereby the Number of their Friends began greatly to increaſe.</p>
            <p>In the mean while <hi>G. Fox</hi> returned into <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> and went to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſtone,</hi> where <hi>Lampitt</hi> before mentioned, was Prieſt. He now ſeeing how the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> did ſet up Meetings, and met in private Houſes, ſaid, <hi>They forſook the Temple, and went to</hi> Jeroboam's <hi>Calves-Houſes;</hi> whereas formerly he had preached of a People, <hi>that would own the Teachings of God;</hi> and that <hi>Men and Women ſhould come to declare the Goſpel.</hi> Now it was told him, <q>That the Old Maſs-Houſes, which were called Churches, were more like <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Calves-houſes; tho' Men ſtrove to perſuade People that ſuch a Building was the Houſe of God: Whereas Chriſt was the Head of the Church, and never was

called the Head of an old Houſe; and that the Apoſtle ſpeaking of Chriſt, ſaid, <hi>Whoſe Houſe we are,</hi> Heb. iii. 6.</q> This Paſſage puts me in Mind, how ſome of the Parliament Soldiers, obſerving, over ſome of the Steeple-houſe-Doors, theſe Words of the Patriarch <hi>Jacob,</hi> when God had appeared to him in a Dream, <hi>This is none other but the Houſe of God, and this is the Gate of Heaven,</hi> could not endure to ſee this groſs Conceit concerning thoſe Buildings, but raſed out the Words, <hi>of God,</hi> and, <hi>of Heaven;</hi> ſo that nothing was left, but, <hi>This is none other but the Houſe;</hi> and <hi>This is the Gate:</hi> And certainly their Zeal was more reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable than the Conceit of thoſe who think that in the Goſpel-Days a building of Lime and Stone may be called, <hi>The Houſe of God.</hi> It ſeems alſo a ſilly Conceit to call a Meeting-houſe, furniſhed with a Steeple, <hi>a Church,</hi> and to deny that Name to the Congregation-houſes of <hi>Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> calling them, and them only, <hi>Meeting-Houſes.</hi> But this Notion hath kept up the Eſteem of thoſe Maſs-houſes; and the Prieſts, that they might not lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When he came to himſelf again, he ſaw <hi>James Lancaſter</hi>'s Wife throwing Stones at his Face, and her Husband <hi>James</hi> was lying over him, to keep the Blows and the Stones from off him: For the People had perſuaded this Woman, that <hi>G.

            <p>Judge <hi>Fell</hi> now deſired of <hi>G.

            <p>The Occaſion upon which a Warrant was iſſued out againſt him, was, a Deſign the Prieſts had laid to touch his Life; in Order to which, a Report was ſpread, that in a certain Meeting he had ſpoken Blaſphemy; and they to maintain this Forgery, had ſuborned falſe Witneſſes.

Men beſides. Coming to <hi>Grayrigg,</hi> he had a Meeting there; where a Prieſt came to oppoſe, but was confounded; and there being many People,<note place="margin">Grayrigg.</note> ſome of the Milk-Pails that ſtood upon the Side of the Houſe, tumbled down, by Reaſon of the Croud; from which the Prieſt afterwards raiſed a Slander, <hi>That the Devil frighted him, and took away one Side of the Houſe.</hi> And tho' this was a known Falſhood, yet it was given out as true in publick Print.</p>
            <p>Another Time this Prieſt came to another Meeting and fell to jang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, ſaying firſt, That <hi>the Scriptures were the Word of God.</hi> To which <hi>G. Fox</hi> ſaid, That <hi>they were the Words of God, but not Chriſt, who is the Word:</hi> And when he urged the Prieſt for Proof of what he had ſaid, the Prieſt being at a Loſs, was not long before he went away. Some Time after he coming again to a Meeting, and hearing that <hi>G. Fox</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected the People to Chriſt Jeſus, the Prieſt taking out his Bible, ſaid, <hi>It was the Word of God.</hi> Then <hi>G. Fox</hi> told him, <hi>It was the Words of God; but not God, the Word.</hi> The Prieſt however perſiſted in what he had ſaid; and offer'd to prove before all the People, <hi>the Scriptures to be the Word of God.</hi> But this Quarrel tending to vain Logomachies, or Conteſts about Words, ended in Confuſion; and many of the Prieſts Followers came to ſee the Vanity of his Aſſertions.</p>
            <p>The Year being now come to an End,<note place="margin">Publick Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions.</note> and a War kindled between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> the II. then in Exile, ask'd the <hi>Dutch</hi> to be receiv'd in their Navy, as a Volunteer, without any Command: But this was courteouſly refuſed by the States General. <hi>Oliver Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi> in the mean while, ſtrove for the ſupreme Authority in <hi>England,</hi> the more, becauſe he perceived how ſome of the Parliament, jealous of his increaſing Greatneſs, endeavoured to croſs him in his Deſign. This made him labour to get the Parliament diſſolved: But they not going on ſo quickly as he would have them, to put a Period to their Sitting, he reſolved arbitrarily to make an End of them. And entering the Houſe in the Month called <hi>April,</hi> 1653, after having rudely inveighed againſt them, by telling them, That they had made a bad Uſe of their Authority, and that without their Diſſolution the Realm would not be ſafe,<note place="margin">

            <p>But what is remarkable, <hi>G.

               </note> he told them, <hi>That before that Day two Weeks the Parliament ſhould be broken up, and the Speaker pluck'd out of his Chair.</hi> And thus it really happened: For at the breaking up of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Speaker being unwilling to come out of his Chair, ſaid, <hi>That he would not come down unleſs he were forced:</hi> Which made General <hi>Harriſon</hi> ſay to him, <hi>Sir, I will lend you my Hand;</hi> and thereupon taking him by the Hand, the Speaker came down. This agreed with what <hi>G. Fox</hi> had predicted. And a Fortnight after, Juſtice <hi>Benſon</hi> told Judge <hi>Fell,</hi> That <hi>now he ſaw</hi> George <hi>was a true Prophet;</hi> ſince <hi>Oliver</hi> had by that Time diſſolved the Parliament.</p>
            <p>Now in <hi>Cumberland</hi> great Threatnings were ſpread, <hi>That if ever</hi> G. Fox <hi>came there again, they would take away his Life.</hi> He hearing this, went thither;<note place="margin">Swartmore. <hi>Juſt.</hi> Pearſon <hi>convinced.</hi>
               </note> but no Body did him any Harm. Returning then to <hi>Swarthmore,</hi> where Juſtice <hi>Anthony Pearſon</hi> was at that Time, he ſo effetually declared Truth, that this Juſtice was convinc'd, and not long after enter'd into the Society of the deſpiſed <hi>Quakers.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bootle <hi>in</hi> Cumberland.</note> 
               <hi>G. Fox</hi> then going again into <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi> went to <hi>Bootle,</hi> and there found preaching in the Steeple-houſe,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:003104_0077_0FEFF3B0A5AF2010"/>
a Prieſt from <hi>London,</hi> who gathered up all the Scriptures he could think of, that ſpake of <hi>Falſe Prophets, Anti-Chriſts,</hi> and <hi>Deceivers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1663</note> and made Application of them to the <hi>Quakers.</hi> But when he had done, <hi>George</hi> began to ſpeak, and return'd all thoſe Scripture Places on the Prieſt; who being diſpleas'd at this, ſaid, <hi>That he muſt not ſpeak there.</hi> But <hi>G. Fox</hi> told him, That <hi>the Hour-glaſs being run, and he having done, the Time was free for him as well as for the Prieſt, who was himſelf but a Stranger there.</hi> He having ſaid this, went on, and ſhewed who were the Falſe Prophets, and what Marks the Scriptures gave of them; directing People to Chriſt their Teacher. When he had done, the Prieſt of the Place made a Speech to the People in the Steeple-houſe Yard, and ſaid, <hi>This Man hath gotten all the honeſt Men and Women in</hi> Lancaſhire <hi>to him; and now he comes here to do the ſame.</hi> To which <hi>G. Fox</hi> returned, <hi>What wilt thou have left? And what have the Prieſts left them, but ſuch as themſelves? For if it be the Honeſt that receive the Truth, and are turned to Chriſt; then it muſt be the Diſhoneſt that follow thee, and ſuch as thou art.</hi> Some Words were alſo exchanged about Tythes; and <hi>G. Fox</hi> told them, <hi>That Chriſt had ended the Tything-Prieſtood, and had ſent forth his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to give freely, as they had received freely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From thence he went to <hi>Cockermouth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cocker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth. J. Lancaſter <hi>ſpeaking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Tree.</hi>
               </note> near which Place he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a Meeting; and coming thither, he found <hi>James Lancaſter</hi> ſpeaking under a Tree, which was ſo full of People, that it was in Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of breaking. <hi>G. Fox</hi> now look'd about for a Place to ſtand upon, for the People lay ſpread up and down. But at length a Perſon came to him, and ask'd, <hi>If he would not go into the Church?</hi> He ſeeing no Place more convenient to ſpeak to the People, told him, <hi>Yes.</hi> Whereupon the People ruſhed in on a ſudden; ſo that he coming, (the Houſe was ſo full of People) had much ado to get in. When they were ſettled, he ſtood up on a Seat, and preached about three Hours; and ſeveral Hundreds were that Day convinced of the Truth of his Doctrine.</p>
            <p>From thence he went to other Places,<note place="margin">Brigham.</note> and particularly to <hi>Brigham,</hi> where he preached in the Steeple-houſe with no leſs Succeſs. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards coming into a certain Place, and caſting his Eye upon a Woman unknown to him, he told her that ſhe had lived a lewd Life: To which ſhe anſwer'd, <hi>That many could tell her of her outward Sins, but of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, none could.</hi> Then he told her, <hi>Her Heart was not right before the Lord:</hi> And ſhe was ſo reach'd, that afterwards ſhe came to be convinc'd of God's Truth.</p>
            <p>Then he came near <hi>Coldbeck,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Coldbeck.</note> to a Market-Town, where he had a Meeting at the Croſs, and ſome received the Truth preached by him.</p>
            <p>From thence he went to <hi>Carliſle,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Carliſle.</note> where the Teacher of the <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> with moſt of his Hearers, came to the Abbey in which <hi>G. Fox</hi> had a Meeting. After the Meeting, the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> Teacher, who was a Notioniſt, and an airy Man, came to him, and ask'd, <hi>What muſt be damned?</hi> And he told him, <hi>That which ſpake in him was to be damned.</hi> And this ſtopt his Mouth. Then he opened to him the States of Election and Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo that he ſaid, <hi>He never heard the like in his Life;</hi> and came af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards alſo to be convinced of the Truth. Then he went up to the Caſtle among the Soldiers, who by beating of the Drum called the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon together. Amongſt theſe he preached, <q>Directing them to the Meaſure of the Spirit of Chriſt in themſelves, by which they might be turned from Darkneſs to Light, and from the Power of Satan to God: He warned them alſo to do no Violence to any Man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>G. Fox</hi> having thus diſcharged himſelf, none oppoſed him, except the Serjeants, who afterwards came to be convinced. On the Market-day
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:003104_0078_0FEFF3B35FE859A8"/>
he went into the Market,<note place="margin">1653</note> tho' he had been threatned, that if he came there he would meet with rude Treatment. But he willing to obey God more than Man, ſhew'd himſelf undaunted, and going upon the Croſs, he declared, <q>That the Day of the Lord was coming upon all deceitful Ways and Doings, and deceitful Merchandize; and that they ſhould put away all cozening and chea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>On the Firſt Day following, he went into the Steeple-houſe, and after the Prieſt had done, he began to preach. Now the Prieſt going away, and the Magiſtrate deſiring <hi>G. Fox</hi> to depart, he ſtill went on, and told them, <hi>He came to ſpeak the Word of Life and Salvation from the Lord amongſt them.</hi> And he ſpoke ſo powerfully, that the People trembled and ſhook, and they thought the Steeple-houſe ſhook alſo; nay, ſome of them feared it would have fallen down on their Heads. Some Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the mean while making a great Buſtle, at length the rude People of the City roſe, and came with Scaves and Stones into the Steeple-houſe. Whereupon the Governour ſent ſome Musketeers to appeaſe the Tumult; and theſe taking <hi>G. Fox</hi> by the Hand in a friendly Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, led him out. Then he came to the Houſe of a Lieutenant, where he had a very quiet Meeting. The next Day the Juſtices and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates ſent for him to come before them in the Town-Hall. So he went thither, and had a long Diſcourſe with them concerning Religion, and ſhew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But after a long Examination, they committed him to Priſon as a Blaſphemer, an Heretick, and a Seducer. There he lay till the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſizes came on, and then all the Talk was, <hi>That he was to be hang'd:</hi> And the High Sheriff, <hi>Willfrey Lawſon,</hi> was ſo eager to have his Life taken away,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sheriff</hi> Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> that he ſaid, <hi>He himſelf would guard</hi> G. Fox <hi>to Execution.</hi> This made ſuch a Noiſe, that even great Ladies came to ſee him, as one that was to die. But tho' both Judge and Magiſtrates were contriving how they might put him to Death, yet the Judges Clark ſtarted a Queſtion which puzzled them, and confounded their Councils, ſo that he was not brought to a Trial, as was expected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which however was contrary to Law. But ſuch was their Envy againſt him, that the Jailor was ordered to put him among Thieves and Murderers, and ſome naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Women; which wicked Crew was ſo louſy, that one Woman was almoſt eaten to Death with Lice: But what made the Priſon the worſe, there was no Houſe of Office to it, and in this naſty Place, Men and Women were put together, againſt all Decency. Yet theſe Priſoners, how naught ſoever, were very loving to <hi>G. Fox,</hi> and ſo hearkened to his whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Counſel, that ſome of them became Converts. But the Under-Jailor did him all the Miſchief he could. Once when he had been a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>gel, crying, <hi>Come out of the Window,</hi> tho' he was then far enough from it. But whilſt the Jailor was thus beating him, he was ſo fill'd with Joy, that he began to ſing, which made the other rage the more, ſo that he went and fetch'd a Fiddler, thinking thereby to vex him. But when this Fellow play'd, he ſang a Hymn ſo loud, that with his Voice he drowned the Sound of the Fiddle, and thereby ſo confounded the Player, that he was fain to give over, and go his Ways.</p>
            <p>Not long after, Juſtice <hi>Benſon</hi>'s Wife felt her ſelf moved to eat no Meat, but what ſhe ſhould eat with <hi>G. Fox</hi> at the Bars of the Dungeon-Window. Afterwards ſhe herſelf was impriſon'd at <hi>York,</hi> when ſhe was big with Child, for having ſpoken, it's like, zealouſly to a Prieſt. And

This <hi>Thomas</hi> once going thro <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and calling the Inhabitants to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, was apprehended, and brought before ſeveral Juſtices, who profer'd him the Oath, under Pretence of his being a Jeſuit. But he ſaying, He could not ſwear, becauſe Chriſt had commanded, <hi>not to ſwear at all,</hi> was ſent to Priſon, where he was kept a Month.

               </note> he came to <hi>Skipton,</hi> where declaring the Word of Truth, he was ſo ſorely abuſed and beaten, that he was ſaid for dead; nevertheleſs, by the Lord's Power, he was healed of all his Bruiſes, and within three Hours, he was healthy and ſound again, to the Aſtoniſhment of thoſe that had ſo abuſed him, and to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing of many that beheld him.</p>
            <p>Then he went to <hi>Bradford,<note place="margin">Is perſecuted in other Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> Leeds,</hi> and <hi>Hallifax,</hi> where he alſo decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Doctrine of Truth amongſt the People; but not without meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with great Perſecution.</p>

               </note> and there went on a Firſt Day of the Week to a Steeple-houſe, where after the Worſhip was done, he ſpoke to the Prieſt and People: But they, inſtead or hearkening to what he ſaid, fell upon him in a great Rage, and drove him out of the Town; and he being ſorely bruiſed, they left him for dead. But before his going from home, he had been firmly perſwaded, that the Lord would preſerve him in all Dangers; and it happened ſo to him according to his Belief; for he got up again, and went to a Friend's Houſe, where he laid himſelf down upon a Bed. But not long after, he felt a very ſtrong Motion to go to a certain Chappel, and there to declare the Word of the Lord: Forthwith he felt alſo an inward Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance that if he gave up to do ſo, the Lord would heal him from his Bruiſes. Then he roſe, as well as he could, and came down Stairs with great Difficulty, by taking hold of the Walls for a Stay; and going out, he began to mend by Degrees; and coming at length in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Chappel, he ſpake as he was moved; and when he had cleared himſelf, he went back to the Houſe from whence he came, and the Lord made him ſound of all his Bruiſes.</p>

               <hi>Truly Husband, I have ſomething to tell thee: One Night, being in Bed, mourning and lamenting with Tears in my Eyes, I heard a Voice, ſaying,</hi> 
               <q>Why art thou ſo diſcontented concerning thy Husband: I have call'd and choſen him to my Work; my Right-hand ſhall uphold him; therefore be thou content, and pleaſed, that he ſerve me, and I will
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:003104_0082_0FEFF3BFEF3A2620"/>
bleſs thee, and thy Children for his Sake; and all Things ſhall proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per that thou ſhalt take in Hand. But if thou wilt not be content, but grudge, and murmur, and repine againſt me, and my Servant, whom I have choſen to do my Work, I will bring a greater Croſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee.</q> 
               <hi>Theſe Words being freſh in my Mind both Night and Day; I often ſaid within my ſelf, What Croſs can this be, that would be greater than the Want of my Husband? But for all this, I could not be content: All the Joy I had or could find, was in our little Boy, who would often, when he ſaw me weeping and mourning, take me about my Neck, and ſay,</hi> My dear Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, pray be content, for my Father will come home in a little Time. <hi>This Child would often comfort me in this Manner; but for all that, I could not be content. Not long after it pleaſed the Lord to take from me this my only Son, my chiefeſt Joy. Then the Voice which I had heard, came into my Mind, and I perceiving that this was the Croſs which the Lord would bring upon me, ſmote upon my Breaſt, and ſaid within my ſelf, that I was the very Cauſe why the Lord had taken away my little Son. A great Fear then ſeizing upon me, I ſaid, O Lord my God! give me Power to be content to give up my Husband freely to do thy Will, leſt, O Lord, thou take away from me all my Children. From that Time I never durſt oppoſe thee, my Husband, any more in the Work of the Lord, for Fear that his Judgments might alſo fall upon me, and my Children.</hi> This ſerved not a little to ſtrengthen <hi>Myles</hi> and to encourage him. Some Time-after walking in his Garden, he felt a Motion to go to <hi>Stanly</hi> Chappel in <hi>Lancaſhire.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Stanly <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in</hi> Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</note> Now tho' he might expect to meet with rude Entertainment there, yet he conſulted not with Fleſh and Blood, but went to the aforeſaid Chappel. Being come, he was not ſuffered to enter, but the Door was violently turned againſt him.

In this Reſignedneſs, within ſix Days, he was moved to go to <hi>Windermore</hi> Steeple-houſe, and it was, as it were, ſaid unto him, <q>Fear not the Face of any Man, but ſpeak the Word of the Lord freely; and then thou ſhalt be made ſound again of all thy Bruiſes. So he went to the ſaid Steeple-houſe, and having ſpoke to the Prieſt and the People the Word of the Lord, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out receiving any Harm, he was healed that Day of his ſore Bruiſes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Sometime after by another Motion he came to <hi>Furneiſs</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi>

anſwered as the other, <hi>I ſhall not ſpeak as long as this dumb Devil is in the Houſe.</hi> Then the People cry'd, <hi>Lord, rebuke thee Satan, Lord, rebuke thee, Satan: What Manner of Spirit is this that ſtops our Miniſters Mouths?</hi> Then the Captain came to <hi>Myles,</hi> and taking him by the Hand, led him out of the Houſe. In all that Time he had not ſpoke a Word, and ſaw now the Accompliſhment of what he had been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded of before, <hi>viz.</hi> That an inviſible Power would confound by him the Wiſdom of the Prieſts, when he ſpoke never a Word. The ſaid <hi>Camelford</hi> was one, who a good while before had ſtirred up the Rabble againſt <hi>G.

            </p>
            <p>Some Time after this Occurrence, <hi>Myles</hi> went to <hi>New-caſtle,</hi> and there ſaid to the Mayor, Rulers, and Prieſts of that Town, <hi>That God's Anger was kindled againſt them, becauſe they had ſhut the Kingdom of Heaven againſt Men, and would not enter themſelves, nor ſuffer them that would.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of this he was impriſoned: But the Mayor being much troubled, ſent for the Sheriff, (for theſe two had committed <hi>Myles</hi> to Priſon;) when come, he ſaid to him, <hi>We have not done well in committing an innocent Man to Priſon: Pray let us releaſe him.</hi> The Sheriff conſenting, <hi>Myles</hi> was ſet at Liberty. Then he declared the Word of the Lord in thoſe Parts, and many were convinced of the Truth held forth by him.

            <p>About this Time,<note place="margin">Secular Tranſactions.</note> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> in the Summer, General <hi>Cromwel</hi> had called a new Parliament, conſiſting moſtly (as hath been ſaid by ſome) of Members of his own Choice; for it was a certain Number of Perſons out of each County and City in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by the Council of Officers, and ſent for to meet at <hi>Weſtminſter:</hi> Into the Hands of theſe <hi>Cromwel</hi> delivered the Supreme Authority of the Nation, by an Inſtrument, or Commiſſion, ſigned by himſelf and the Officers; but the Authority of this Meeting laſted ſcarce half a Year, as will be ſaid in the Sequel. To this Parliament a Report was made, <hi>That at</hi> Carliſle <hi>a Perſon was impriſoned, who was to die for Religion.</hi> This was <hi>G.

Fox</hi> knowing how ſcandalouſly he had been belied about ſpeaking blaſphemous Words, gave forth a Paper, wherein he challenged all who found Fault with his Doctrine, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in publick; ſince he was ready to ſtand the Teſt of whatſoever he might have ſpoken. He alſo wrote a ſignificant Letter to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices at <hi>Carliſle,</hi> wherein he ſhewed them plainly the Injuſtice of their Dealings, and the horrid Evil of Perſecution, as having been always the Work of the falſe Church.

The <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> who went along with him, had his Sword taken from him, and was ſorely beaten with it; yet this did not frighten or diſcourage him; and he not only left off the Wearing of a Sword; but alſo freely gave up the Inheritance of an Impropriation of Tythes.

               </gap>l him, but it was the Portion of many Hundreds, nay perhaps Thouſands of thoſe of his Perſwaſion: Wherefore I won't undertake to relate all that might be mention'd of this Kind; for that would be beyond my Reach. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, by this that hath been ſaid, may be ſeen, by what Means the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> ſo called, grew ſo numerous in thoſe early Times. As on one Hand, there were raiſed zealous Preachers; ſo on the other, there were Abundance of People in <hi>England,</hi> who having ſearched all Sects, could no where find Satisfaction for their hungry Souls. And theſe now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding that God by his Light was ſo near in their Hearts, began to take Heed thereunto, and ſoon found, that this gave them far more Victory over the Corruption of their Minds, (under which they had long groaned) than all the ſelf-will<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And beſides thoſe that were thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to receive a farther Manifeſtation of the Way of Life, there were alſo many of a rude Life, who being prick'd to the Heart, and brought over by the Chriſtian Patience of the deſpiſed <hi>Quakers,</hi> became as zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in doing Good, as formerly they had been in working Evil.</p>
            <p>But perhaps ſome will think it was very indecent that they went ſo frequently to the Steeple-houſes, and there ſpoke to the Prieſts: But whatſoever any may judge concerning this, it is certain that thoſe Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers generally did not bring forth the Fruits of Godlineſs, as was well known to thoſe who themſelves had been Prieſts, and freely reſigned their Miniſtry, thenceforth to follow Chriſt in the Way of his Croſs; and theſe were none of the leaſt zealous againſt that Society among whom they formerly had miniſtred with an upright Zeal. Yet they were not for uſing ſharp Language againſt ſuch Teachers, who, according to their Knowledge, feared God; but they levelled their Aim chiefly againſt thoſe who were only rich in Words, without bringing forth true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Fruits, and Works of Juſtice.

that there were not a few of that Sort, appeared plainly when King <hi>Charles</hi> the II. was reſtored; for thoſe who had formerly cry'd out againſt Epiſcopacy, and its Liturgy, as falſe and idolatrous, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Turncoats, and put on the Surplice, to keep in the Poſſeſſion of their Livings and Benefices. But by ſo doing, theſe Hypocrites loſt not a few of their Auditors; for this opened the Eyes of many, who began to enquire into the Doctrine of the deſpiſed <hi>Quakers,</hi> and ſaw that they had a more ſure Foundation, and that this it was which made them ſtand unſhaken againſt the Fury of Perſecution.</p>
            <p>Let us again take up the Thread of thoſe Tranſactions which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern <hi>G. Fox:</hi>

                  <hi>G. Fox</hi> tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels in the North of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </note> Who now travelling thro' many Places in the North of <hi>England,</hi> had every where great Meetings; but now and then met with ſome Oppoſition; ſometimes with Hands, and at other Times with the Tongue:<note place="margin">Darwent-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> Among the reſt, at <hi>Darwantwater</hi> in <hi>Northumberland;</hi> where in a Diſpute recommending Perfection, he was contradicted; but to prove his Poſition, he ſaid, <q>That <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were perfect before they fell; and all that God made was perfect; and that the Imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction came by the Devil and the Fall; but that Chriſt, who came to deſtroy the Devil,<note place="margin">Mat. v. 48. Joh. iv. 17. Ch. xv. 15. Ch. iv. 18.</note> ſaid, <hi>Be ye perfect.</hi>
               </q> To this one of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors anſwer'd, That <hi>Job</hi> ſaid, <hi>Shall mortal Man be more pure than his Maker? The Heavens are not clear in his Sight. God charged his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels with Folly.</hi> But <hi>G. Fox</hi> ſhew'd him his Miſtake, and told him, <q>That it was not <hi>Job</hi> that ſaid ſo, but one of thoſe that contended againſt him.</q> Then the Profeſſors ſaid, <hi>The outward Body was the Body of Death and Sin.</hi> But <hi>G. Fox</hi> replied, <q>That <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> had each of them an outward Body, before the Body of Death and Sin got into them; and that Men would have Bodies, when the Body of Sin and Death was put off again, and they were renewed into the Image of God again by Chriſt Jeſus.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus <hi>G. Fox</hi> found almoſt every where Work, and paſſing to <hi>Hexam,</hi> he had a great Meeting there on the Top of a Hill. The Prieſt indeed had threatned, that he would come and oppoſe; but he came not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>G. Fox</hi> then travelling on, came into <hi>Cumberland,</hi> where he had a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of many Thouſands of People,<note place="margin">Langlands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Brigham.</note> on a Hill near <hi>Langlands.</hi> Once he came into <hi>Brigham</hi> Steeple-houſe, before the Prieſt was there, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the Truth to the People; but when the Prieſt came in, he began to oppoſe, but was wearied ſo, that at length he went away. There being now alſo ſeveral others who preached the Doctrine of the inward Light of God which convinceth Man of Sin, the Number of thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the Light increaſed greatly: And as it had been ſaid at firſt, <hi>That they ſhould be deſtroyed within a ſhort Time;</hi> ſo now the Prieſts began to ſay, <hi>That they would eat out one another:</hi> For many of them, after Meetings, having a great Way to go, ſtaid at their Friends Houſes by the Way, and ſometimes more than there were Beds to lodge in, ſo that ſome lay on the Hay-Mows. This made ſome of the publick Church grow afraid, that this Hoſpitality would cauſe Poverty, and that when theſe Friends had eaten out one another, they would come to be maintained by the Pariſhes, and ſo be chargeable to them. But it ſell out quite otherwiſe, for theſe People wore the more bleſſed, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, without falling into Want. This puts me mind of what one of the Daughters of Judge <hi>Thomas Fell</hi> once told me, <hi>viz.</hi> That her Father having been abroad, and coming home with his Servants, found the Shed ſo full of the Horſes of ſtrange Gueſts, (for <hi>Margaret</hi> his Wife had cleared the Stable where they firſt ſtood, to make Room for her Husband's own Horſes) that he ſaid to his Wife, <hi>This was the Way to be eaten out, and that thus they themſelves ſhould ſoon be in Want of Hay.</hi> But

to this <hi>Margaret</hi> ſaid in a Friendly Way, <hi>That ſhe did not belie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, when the Year was at an End, they ſhould have the leſs for that.</hi> And it ſo fell out; for this Year their Stock of Hay was ſuch, that they ſold a great Parcel of what they had in Abundance. Thus the Proverb was verify'd, That <hi>Charity doth not impoveriſh.</hi> The Truth of this was alſo experienced by thoſe called <hi>Quakers;</hi> for tho' many People at firſt were ſhy, and would not deal with them, becauſe of their Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with the vulgar Salutation, and their ſaying <hi>Thou</hi> and <hi>Thee</hi> to a ſingle Perſon, inſtead of <hi>You,</hi> &amp;c. inſomuch, that ſome that were Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, loſt their Cuſtomers, and could hardly get Money enough to buy Bread: Yet this changed in Time, when People found by Experience they could better truſt to the Words of theſe, than to that of thoſe of their own Perſuaſion. Hence it was, that often when any came into a Town, and wanted ſomething, they would ask, <hi>Where dwells a Draper, or Taylor, or Shoemaker,</hi> or any other Tradeſman, <hi>that is a</hi> Quaker? But this ſo exaſperated others, that they began to cry out, <hi>If we let theſe</hi> Quakers <hi>alone, they will take the Trade of the Nation out of our Hands.</hi> Now the Cauſe of their Trade's thus encreaſing, was, becauſe they were found upright in their Dealing; for Integrity did then ſhine out among them above many others: To this the true Fear of God led them, and to this they were exhorted from Time to Time. <hi>G. Fox</hi> alſo wrote a General Epiſtle to them, which was as followeth:</p>

But when <hi>F. Howgill,</hi> and <hi>E.

            <p>At <hi>London</hi> there is a Cuſtom in Summer-time, when the Evening ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, and Tradeſmen leave off working, that many luſty Fellows meet in the Fields to try their Skill and Strength in wreſtling, where generally a Multitude of People ſtands gazing in a Round. Now it ſo fell out, that <hi>E.

Burrough</hi> ſtept into the Ring, commonly made up of all Sorts of People: And having look'd upon the Wreſtler with a ſerious Countenance, the Man was not a little ſurprized, inſtead of an airy Antagoniſt, to meet with a grave and awful young Man; and all ſtood as it were amazed at this Sight, eagerly expecting what would be the Iſſue of this Combat. But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

For having already ſought againſt Spiritual Wickedneſs, that had once prevailed on him, and having overcome in Meaſure by the Grace of God, he now endeavour'd alſo to fight againſt it in others, and to turn them from the Evil of their Ways. With this Intention he began very ſeriouſly to ſpeak to the Standers by, and that with ſuch a heart-piercing Power, that he was heard by this mixt Multitude with no leſs Attention than Admiration; for his Speech tended to turn them from Darkneſs to the Light, and from the Power of Satan to God. To effect this, he labour'd with convincing Words, ſhewing, How God had not left himſelf without a Witneſs, but had given to Man a Meaſure of his Grace, and enlighten'd every one with the Light of Chriſt. Thus he preached zealouſly: And tho' many might look upon this as a Novelty, yet it was of ſuch Effect, that ſome were convinced of the Truth; for he was a Breaker of ſtony Hearts, and therefore, by a certain Author, not unjuſtly called, <hi>A Son of Thunder;</hi> tho' he alſo omitted not in due Seaſon to ſpeak a Word of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation to thoſe that were of a broken Heart, and of a contrite Spirit: But to thunder againſt Sin and Iniquity was his peculiar Talent; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that once preaching very zealouſly in a Meeting, and perceiving there were ſome contrite Souls, that wanted ſpiritually refreſhing Food, he was heard to intimate, That tho' his preſent Speaking was not Milk for Babes, yet he would remember ſuch a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nt Men were touched to the Heart by the Power of the Word of Life which he preached. And altho' Coals of Fire, as it were, came forth of his Mouth to the conſuming of Briars and Thorns, and he paſſing thro' un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beaten Paths, trampled upon wild Thiſtles, and luxuriant Tares; yet his wholeſom Doctrine dropp'd as the Oil of Joy upon the Spirits of the Mourners in <hi>Sion.</hi>
               <note place="margin">F.

This often caus'd a Tumult in the Town; and ſome ſaid (not without good Reaſon) that the Apprentices durſt not have left their Work, had not their Maſters given them Leave. And a certain Perſon inform'd the Mayor and Aldermen upon his Oath, <hi>That he had heard an Apprentice ſay, that they had Leave from their Maſters, and were encouraged;</hi>

Liberty of Conſcience is a Natural Right, and he that would have it, ought to give it, having Liberty to ſettle what he likes for the Publick. Indeed That hath been the Vanity of our Conteſts: Every Sect ſaith, Give me Liberty: But give it him, and to his Power he will not yield it to any Body elſe. Where is our Ingenuity? Truly that is a Thing that ought to be very reciprocal. The Migiſtrate hath his Supremacy, and he may ſettle Religion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Conſcience: And I may ſay it to you, I can ſay it: All the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in the Nation would not have tempted Men to fight upon ſuch an Account as they have engaged, if they had not had Hopes of Liberty, better than they had from</hi> Epiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But by hearkening to the Flatteries of the Clergy, at length he loſt his Credit, even with thoſe who with him had fought for the common Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; and thus at laſt befell him after his Death, what he ſeemed to have imprecated on himſelf in the foregoing Speech, if he departed from allowing due Liberty: For he farther ſaid. <hi>That many of the People had been neceſſitated to go into the vaſt howling Wilderneſs in</hi> New-England, <hi>for the Enjoyment of their Liberty; and that Liberty was a Fundamental of the Government;</hi> adding, <hi>that it had coſt much Blood to have it ſo, and even the hazarding of all.</hi> And in the Concluſion he ſaid, <hi>That he could ſooner be willing to be rolled into his Grave, and buried with Infamy, than give his Conſent to the wilful throwing away of that Government, ſo teſtified unto in the Fundamentals of it.</hi> Now, who knows not what infamy befel him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, when in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

That <hi>they were falſe Prophets, and falſe Teachers,</hi> ſuch as the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Chriſt, and his Apoſtles cried againſt. <hi>Nay,</hi> ſaid a Profeſſor to That: But he ſaid, <hi>Yes; for you leaving the Matter, and going to another thing, ſeem to conſent to the Proof of the former Charge.</hi> Now, their Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion was, <hi>Seeing thoſe falſe Prophets were adulterated, whether he did judge Prieſt</hi> Stephens <hi>an Adulterer.</hi> To this he anſwer'd, <hi>That he was adulterated from God in his Practice, like thoſe falſe Prophets.</hi> Then they broke up the Meeting, and <hi>Stephens</hi> deſir'd, that <hi>G.

Judge <hi>Fell</hi> was very unwilling to part with him; but <hi>Margaret</hi> his Wife, tho' ſhe could not well give him up before, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that the Lord required his Service,<note place="margin">And entring on the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, leaves Judge <hi>Fell's</hi> Family, tho' not willing to part with him.

            <p>About the End of the Year 1654, being eighteen Years of Age, he took his Leave of that Family, which was not done without mutual ſhedding of Tears at parting.

And on a Firſt-Day of the Week was at two Steeple-houſes, at one of which he had large Liberty to ſpeak, being indeed perſwaſive in Speech; and in the Afternoon at a Meeting of <hi>Diſſenters</hi> from the publick Worſhip, he had Liberty to ſpeak, and to publiſh Truth without Oppoſition or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction from any; and many were added to the Faith: For at that Time there were Twelve miniſtring Brethren, moſt of them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

They ſtaid yet ſome Days in his Houſe, and he became ſo ſtrengthened by their Miniſtry, that he joined with them in Profeſſion, and alſo gave up his Houſe to be a Meeting-place for their Friends.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>W. Caton</hi> and <hi>J.

            <p>After ſome Stay they went to <hi>Rumney,</hi> and alſo to <hi>Lidd.</hi> Here it was that <hi>Samuel Fiſher,</hi> both by their Miniſtry, and by that of <hi>Ambroſe Rigg,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Robinſon,</hi> (who alſo now were gone forth in the Service of the Goſpel) was convinced, and brought over to their Society. He was one trained up to Literature, and had ſtudied diligently in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity; and tho' he was but young then, yet of a pious Converſation, diſliked many Ceremonies and Cuſtoms uſual in the Schools.

                  <hi>S.

But after having been thus employ'd ſome Time, he came to ſee that Infant-Baptiſm was an humane Inſtitution, and to preach for Wages unlawful. To this, may be added, that <hi>Luke Howard,</hi> ſome Time before he knew the <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſo called, not being ſatisfied concerning the ſinging of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s Pſalms at the publick Worſhip, ſo troubled his Maſter that he had been Apprentice with, that he got <hi>Samuel Fiſher,</hi> as a learned Miniſter, to come and diſcourſe with him, and to try to convince him: And <hi>S. Fiſher</hi> talking with him, <hi>L. Howard,</hi> told him, <hi>That God was a Spirit, and muſt be worſhiped in Spirit and Truth, of all thoſe that would worſhip him acceptably.</hi> And alſo, <q>That it was contrary to Truth for a proud Man to ſing, <hi>He was not puft in Mind, he had no ſcornful Eye, and he did not exerciſe himſelf in Things that were too high;</hi> when he lived in Pride, wherein God beheld him afar off. And farther, that it was very unbecoming for ſuch an one to ſing, <hi>Rivers of Tears run down mine Eyes, becauſe other Men keep not thy Laws,</hi> when he never knew a true Sorrow and Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for his own Sins.</q> This Reaſon of <hi>Howard</hi>'s againſt the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Singing in their Worſhip, had ſo much Influence upon <hi>S. Fiſher,</hi> that from that Time he was ſtop'd from any more giving <hi>David</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to the People to ſing: And becoming in Time more and more uneaſy to go on in acting what was burthenſome to his Conſcience, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to deſiſt from his Miniſtry, and ſo went to the Biſhop, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd up the Commiſſion that he had received from him to preach: And taſting himſelf upon God's Providence, he took a Farm, and turned Graſier, by which Means he maintain'd his Wife and Children much better to his Content than before.</p>

               <pb n="102" facs="unknown:003104_0113_0FEFF4009014AB30"/>Departing thus from the Epiſcopalian Church, he went over to the <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> and became a Zealous Teacher among them. It was about this Time that <hi>W. Caton</hi> and <hi>J. Stubs</hi> came to <hi>Lidd,</hi> whom <hi>S. Fiſher</hi> received into his Houſe, remembring that Scripture Exhortation, <hi>Be not forgetful to entertain Strangers, for many thereby have entertained Angels unawares. W. Caton</hi> now went to the Meeting of the <hi>Independents,</hi> and <hi>Stubs</hi> to that of the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,</hi> where <hi>Fiſher</hi> then preached; and <hi>J. Stubs</hi> having got Opportunity to ſpeak, declared Truth ſo plainly, than <hi>S. Fiſher</hi> being very much affected with it, began to paraphraſe upon it with Excellency of Speech. <hi>W. Caton</hi> and <hi>J. Stubs</hi> departing this Place, went to another Town in this County, but not long after returning to <hi>Lidd</hi> they found <hi>S. Fiſher</hi> in Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with themſelves; for it happened that his Fellow-Teacher <hi>George Hammond,</hi> in his Sermon, ſo violently inveighed againſt thoſe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Quakers,</hi> that <hi>S. Fiſher</hi> could not be ſatisfied until he ſtood up in the ſame Meeting, and bore a publick Teſtimony againſt the Reviſings of <hi>Hammond,</hi> ſaying to him, <hi>Dear Brother, You are very dear and near to me, but the Truth is nearer and dearer: It is the everlaſting Truth and Goſpel which they hold forth:</hi> And ſpeaking more Words to that Effect, he openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the Doctrine of the reviled <hi>Quakers.</hi> This ſo vexed <hi>Hammond,</hi> that falling into a greater Rage, he ſaid, <hi>Our Brother</hi> Fiſher <hi>is alſo bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> But <hi>Fiſher</hi> render'd not Reviling for Reviling, but continued witn Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience in the Faith.

Then <hi>Parnel</hi> was hurried into a Houſe, and ſome of his Friends engaged, that he ſhould be forth-coming when their Worſhip was done.

Then Juſtice <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kering</hi> pull'd his Hat off his Head, and threw it away; and they que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion'd him concerning many Things; all which he anſwer'd, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny frivilous Queſtions ask'd to enſnare him. At laſt he was committed to the common Jail at <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> where none of his Friends were ſuffered to come to him. The Time of the Seſſions at <hi>Chelmsford</hi> being come, he, with ſeveral Felons and Murderers was faſtned to a Chain, and thus led about eighteen Miles thro' the Country, remaining chain'd both Night and Day. Being then brought into the Court before Judge <hi>Hills,</hi> the Jailor took off his Hat, and caſt it upon the Floor. Then the Clerk read his Indictment, and asked him, <hi>If he was guilty?</hi> To which he ſaid, That <hi>he denied all Guilt;</hi> and he called for his Accuſers. The Judge then ſaid, <hi>he might ſee them;</hi> and that he ought to ſay, <hi>Guilty or not Guilty.</hi> On which <hi>Parnel</hi> told him, <hi>He was not Guilty.</hi> Then a Jury of twelve Men was call'd; their Foreman was a Drunkard: Prieſt <hi>Willis</hi> was alſo call'd, who ſwore againſt him, and ſo did two Juſtices; one of their Men ſwearing, That <hi>they would ſpeak nothing againſt him but the Truth.</hi> The Accuſations were, <hi>That in a riotous Manner he did enter into the Pariſh Church at</hi> Great Coggeſhall; <hi>that he there did ſtand up, and told the Miniſter,</hi> he blaſphemed, <hi>and ſpoke falſly, uſing many other reproachful Words againſt him: And that he could not give a good Account where he was laſt ſettled, or of his Life and Converſation, appearing to be an idle Perſon.</hi> He was alſo accuſed <hi>with Contempt of the Magiſtracy and of the Miniſtry.</hi> To this he anſwer'd, <hi>That he no Ways in a riotous Manner enter'd the Steeple-houſe, but came thither quietly, and alone: For being followed by ſeveral Boys that would have come in after him, he bad them go in before, rather than to go in diſorderly, whereby to occaſion any Diſturbance. That he had ſaid to Prieſt</hi> Willis, He blaſphemed, <hi>by ſaying,</hi> The Church in God was Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe, <hi>he denied not; but did not own himſelf to be a Vagabond and idle Perſon. And he did not think it indecent, to call an unjuſt Judge,</hi> unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous; <hi>a Perſecutor,</hi> Perſecutor; <hi>and a Deceiver,</hi> Deceiver. Thus <hi>Parnel</hi> pleaded his Cauſe. Yet the Judge ſaid to the Jury, <hi>That if they did not find him Guilty, the Sin would lie upon their Heads;</hi> thus condemning the Priſoner before the Jury were entered into Deliberation. Then <hi>J. Parnel</hi> began to ſpeak, to inform them concerning his Cauſe, but the Judge would not ſuffer him, tho' one of the Jury deſired it. After Conſultation, the Jury had nothing to lay to his Charge, but a Paper in which he had anſwered the <hi>Mittimus,</hi> tho' he had already owned this Paper to be his Writing. But in that they were at a Loſs, becauſe in the Indictment he was accuſed of a Riot: Yet the Judge and the Clerk ſtrove to draw ſome Words from the Foreman, which the other Jury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men did not conſent to, and he himſelf was unwilling to anſwer fully to their Queſtions. Then <hi>J. Parnel</hi> was made to withdraw; and being call'd in again, the Judge fined him to the Value of about For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Pounds, <hi>for Contempt of the Magiſtracy and Miniſtry;</hi> for he ſaid, <hi>The</hi> Lord Protector <hi>had charged him to puniſh ſuch Perſons as ſhould contemn ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Magiſtracy or Miniſtry.</hi> Hereupon <hi>J.

Afterwards he was put into the Hole in the Wall, a Room much like to a Baker's Oven; for the Walls of that Building, which is indeed a direful Neſt, are of an exceſſive Thickneſs, as I have ſeen my ſelf, having been in the Hole where this pious young Man ended his Days, as will be ſaid by-and-by.

Continuing in this moiſt Hole, his Limbs grew benumbed; and thus it once happened, that as he was climbing up the Ladder, with his Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als in one Hand, and come to the Top thereof, catching at the Rope with his other, he miſſed the ſame, and fell down upon the Stones, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he was exceedingly wounded in his Head, and his Body ſo bruiſed, that he was taken up for dead. Then they put him into a Hole under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the other; for there were two Rows of ſuch vaulted Holes in the Wall. This Hole was called the Oven, and ſo little, that ſome Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers Ovens have been bigger, tho' not ſo High. Here (the Door be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhut) was ſcarcely any Air, there being no Window or Hole.

This hard Impriſonment did ſo weaken him, that after ten or eleven Months he fell ſick, and died. At his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture there were with him <hi>Thomas Shortland,</hi>

                  <p>MY dear Heart, my dear Love in the Bowels of Love, in the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, ſalutes thee and my Children. My Soul, my Soul is poured forth in Love to thee daily, and the Breathings of my Soul to my Father is for thee, that thou may'ſt be kept in the Fear of the Lord, and in his Counſel daily, and ſo thou may'ſt come to Reſt and Peace, that is laid up for all that fear him, and walk in Obedience to the <hi>Light</hi> that Jeſus Chriſt hath enlighten'd them withal. So my dear Heart, I declare to thee, in the Preſence of the Living God, who is Lord of Heaven and Earth, and before Men and Angels, there is no other Way that leads to Peace and Eternal Reſt, but walking in Obedience to the <hi>Light</hi> that comes from Jeſus Chriſt; and of this <hi>Light</hi> thou haſt received a Meaſure. Therefore, my dear Heart, be faithful to the Lord in what is made known unto thee, that thou may'ſt come to witneſs true Peace and Reſt, <hi>that Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, neither hath it entred into the Heart of Man, what is laid up for all them that fear him.</hi> So, my dear Heart, as I have found Peace and eternal Reſt to my Soul from the Lord, ſo I am moved of the Lord in Love to thy Soul, to ſhew thee the Way that leads to Peace and eternal Reſt, which Way is Chriſt, who is the <hi>Light,</hi> and the Way that leads to the Father, from whence all <hi>Light</hi> comes; and of this <hi>Light</hi> which comes from Chriſt, I bear Record thou haſt received a Meaſure. Therefore in dear Love I exhort thee to walk in Obedience to thy Meaſure, which thou haſt received from the Lord. So, in the Preſence of the Lord God do I declare, that walking in Obedience to this <hi>Light</hi> that comes from Chriſt, is the Way that leads to eternal Reſt and Peace. Therefore as thou tendereſt the eternal Good of thy Soul, be faithful to the Light that comes from Chriſt, which <hi>Light</hi> beareth Witneſs againſt Lying, and Swearing, and vain Talking, and all Manner of Evil. So, my dear Wife, in Bowels of dear Love to thy Soul, which is more precious than all the World, have I ſhewed thee the Way; if thou wilt walk in it, it will lead thee into the eternal Covenant of Life and Peace. So, my dear Life, in Love, in Love I have cleared my Conſcience to thee, in the Preſence of the Living God, as a true and faithful Husband to thee, deſiring thy eternal Good and Welfare as my own, the Lord God is my Witneſs. Dear life, remember my dear Love to all my Friends and Countrymen according to the Fleſh; for I deſire the eternal Good and Welfare of you all, and that you all may come to believe in the <hi>Light</hi> in your own Conſciences, which Jeſus Chriſt hath enlightned you with; which <hi>Light</hi> bears witneſs againſt Lying, and Swearing, and all Manner of Evil. This is the <hi>Light</hi> of Chriſt, and walking in Obedience to this <hi>Light,</hi> is the Way that leads out of Sin and Evil, up to God Eternal, bleſſed for evermore: And he that acts contrary to this <hi>Light</hi> in his own Conſcience, it is his Condemnation. Now, dear Friends, while you have Time, prize it.</p>

            <p>A chief Cauſe why he was impriſoned there,<note place="margin">The Cauſe of his Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of <hi>T. Salthouſe</hi> his Fellow-Traveller.</note> was, that <hi>Thomas Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,</hi> with whom he travelled, (having heard that one <hi>George Brooks,</hi> a Prieſt belonging to the <hi>Nightingale</hi> Frigat, ſaid, after the Declarations of <hi>M. Halhead</hi> and <hi>T. Salthouſe</hi> at <hi>Plymouth, That it was the eternal Truth, which they had ſpoken,</hi> with many other Words in Vindication of what they ſaid) told <hi>Brooks, That he had ſpoken many good Words and fair Speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es;</hi> but ask'd him, <hi>Whether he liv'd the Life of what he ſpoke?</hi> Farther, <hi>He that entereth not by the Door, but climbeth up ſome other Way, is, as Chriſt ſaid, a Thief and a Robber.</hi> For <hi>T. Salthouſe</hi> thought, and that not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reaſon, as will be ſhewn by-and-by, that he did not want the Praiſes of this Prieſt, that were not better than thoſe of the Damſel poſſeſs'd with a Spirit of Divination, which ſhe ſpoke concerning <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> viz. <hi>Theſe Men are the Servants of the Moſt High God, which ſhew unto us the Way of Salvation.</hi> Now what <hi>T. Salthouſe</hi> had ſpoken to the Prieſt, was call'd provoking Language; the rather, becauſe when the Prieſt was ſpeaking of the Trinity, <hi>T. Salthouſe</hi> had ask'd him, <hi>Where that
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:003104_0124_0FEFF44CCAC94E88"/>
Word was to be found in the Scriptures?</hi> Saying farther, <hi>I know no ſuch Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that ſpeaks of the three Perſons in the Trinity; but the Three that the Scripture ſpeaks of, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, and theſe Three are One.</hi> From hence <hi>T. Salthouſe,</hi> and <hi>M. Halhead</hi> were accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as ſuch that denied the <hi>Holy Three that are One.</hi> But becauſe about this Accuſation they were at a Loſs in the Court, ſomething elſe was thought of to enſnare them, <hi>viz.</hi> they were required to take the <hi>Oath of Abjuration of the Pope.</hi> This Oath the Mayor of <hi>Plymouth</hi> had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready tender'd them, when they were firſt apprehended; and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to ſwear, were ſent to <hi>Exeter</hi> Priſon: And now being brought to Trial, and the ſaid Oath required of them, they anſwered thus;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the preſence of the Eternal God, and before all this People, we do deny with as much Deteſtation as any of you doth, the Pope, and his Supremacy, and the Purgatory, and all that is in the Form of the Oath mention'd, we declare freely againſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> And we do not deny to ſwear, becauſe of any Guilt that is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, but in Obedience to the Command of Chriſt, who ſaith,</hi> Swear not at all: <hi>And we will not come under the Condemnation of an Oath, for the Liberty of the outward Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus refuſing to ſwear, meerly not to treſpaſs againſt the Command of our Saviour, they were ſent back to Priſon again, as ſuch that clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinely adher'd to the Pope: And Uſe hath been made of this Snare during the Space of many Years, to vex the <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſo called. The next Day the Priſoners were brought again before the Bench, and were asked,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Will ye confeſs that you wronged</hi> G. Brooks <hi>in calling him Thief, and be ſorry for it, and make him Satisfaction?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this <hi>M. Halhead</hi> anſwered,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>One of us did not ſpeak one Word to him, and therefore I deny to make him Satisfaction, or to be ſorry for it: And what was ſpoken, was no ſuch Thing; therefore we will not lie for our Liberty, nor confeſs that we are ſorry for that which we never ſpoke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the Court fined them five Pounds a-piece;<note place="margin">They are fined and ſent to <hi>Bridewel.</hi>
               </note> and they were to go to the Houſe of Correction till Payment, and to find Sureties for their good Behaviour: And for refuſing to take the Oath, the Court threatned to ſend into the North to ſeize on their Eſtates. So they were returned to Priſon; and what follows was entred as the Record of their Proceedings.</p>
            <p>July 10. 1655. Thomas Salthouſe; <hi>and</hi> Myles Halhead, <hi>for provoking Words againſt</hi> G. Brooks, <hi>Clerk, who refuſed to be try'd by the Country, fined 5 <abbr>

            </p>
            <p>What is ſaid here of refuſing to be try'd by the Country, was a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Untruth; and as to finding Sureties, that ſeemed of little Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for tho' the giving of Security had been offer'd before when they were taken Priſoners, yet that was not accepted of; and the Mayor <hi>John Page,</hi> had the Boldneſs to aſſert, that they refuſed to give Security, as will appear by the Warrant by which he ſent them to the common Jail in <hi>Exeter,</hi> whereof the following is a true Copy.</p>

Indeed, <hi>Sir,</hi> their Carriage here was not becoming Men, much leſs Chriſtians; and beſides their Contempt of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, all the while they were in Priſon, they never ſought God by Prayer at any Time, nor deſired a Bleſſing on any Creature they received, or gave Thanks for them. And theſe very Men were about two Months paſt taken up by Colonel <hi>Cupplefton,</hi> High Sheriff of our County, and after fourteen Days Reſtraint, were ſent away by him for <hi>Taunton,</hi> from Tithing to Tithing, as by their own Examination; and they ſhew no Occaſion they have to come to theſe Parts. They are by Profeſſion <hi>Quakers,</hi> but Husbandmen by their Calling: One of them is a <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> Man, the other of <hi>Weſtmorland;</hi> and they left their Families, Relations, and Callings about three Months ſince, as they ſay, and do not work, nor employ themſelves in their Calling, to procure themſelves a Livelihood, but wander up and down in all Parts, to vent their wicked Opinions, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their irregular Practices in the Breach of Peace, and Diſturbance of good People. Indeed, <hi>Sir,</hi> they hold many ſad Opinions, deſtructive to the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the Power of Godlineſs. I have hereby, according to my Duty, given your Honour an Account of what paſs'd here in Reference to theſe Men. I could ſay much more in Reference to their Examination and Diſcourſe with them; but I fear I have already treſpaſſed upon your Honour's Patience in the Peruſal of theſe Lines, and humbly deſiring your Excuſe for giving you this Trouble, do moſt thankfully acknowledge your Honour's continu'd Favours to this Place, for which we ſtand very much obliged, deſiring your Honour ſtill to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch an Opinion of us, as thoſe that deſire to do nothing unbecoming Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and Perſons that deſire the Welfare and Peace of this Common-wealth and Government, and ſhall ever labour to appear</p>

            <p>That General <hi>Disbrow</hi> was but little ſatisfied with this Letter, ſeems not improbable, becauſe enquiring into the Matter, he let others have a Copy of it, ſo that <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Myles</hi> wrote an Anſwer to it; and it was alſo ſome Time after given out in publick Print at <hi>London,</hi> by <hi>Giles Calvert,</hi> with other Writings relating thereunto. Now as to what is ſaid in this Letter of <hi>His Highneſs's Proclamation againſt</hi> Quakers, it was a groſs Untruth; for in the Proclamation the <hi>Quakers</hi> were not named; but it was againſt the Diſturbing of Chriſtians in their Aſſemblies; and beſides, the <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſo called, judged that their publick Worſhip was permitted them by the 37th Article of the Inſtrument of Government, which ſaid, <hi>That all that profeſs Faith in God by Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained from, but be protected in the Profeſſion of the Faith, and Exerciſe of their Religion,</hi> &amp;c. As concerning <hi>their Contempt of Authority,</hi> the Mayor charged them with, it was nothing elſe, but that for Conſcience-ſake they could not take off their Hats to the Magiſtrates; neither did they give that Honour to any other but God alone. And as to what was ſaid, <hi>That all the While they were in Priſon, they never ſought God by Prayer,</hi> &amp;c. This was no other Matter, than that they did not follow the Formal Way of Prayers; for they were indeed religious Men, who often prayed to God, and gave him Thanks, tho' they were repreſented in the Letter as very wicked Men, and Vagabonds that had left their Calling, and wander'd up and down the Country; altho' it was well known that they were honeſt Men, that travell'd on Horſeback, and lying at the beſt inns
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:003104_0127_0FEFF415EE6797C8"/>
on the Road, and paying for what they received there. And therefore after they had got a Copy of the ſaid Letter, they writ a large Letter to the Mayor <hi>Page,</hi> and ſhewed him his abominable Untruths, and told him, that <hi>they had been moved ſeveral Times in Priſon, as well as out of Priſon, to go to Prayers, and to give Thanks for the Bleſſings of God, which they received.</hi> And in the Concluſion of their Letter, they ſignified, <hi>That they would not render Railing for Railing; but</hi> (ſaid they) <hi>in the Spirit of Love and Meekneſs we exhort you all to repent, and fear to offend the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p>This Paper being ſet up, People came to read it: <hi>G.

               </note> and ſeveral other of his Friends were put into Priſon at <hi>Northampton.</hi> It happened that he being at <hi>Wellingborough,</hi> and going along the Streets, the Prieſt <hi>Thomas Andrews</hi> called to him in theſe Words, <hi>Give over deceiving the People, leſt the Plagues of God fall on thee.</hi> To this <hi>Dewsbury</hi> returned, <hi>Doſt thou ſay I deceive the People?

Afterwards <hi>Dewsbury</hi> went into the Steeple-Houſe in the ſaid Town, and after the Sermon was done, he demanded of the Prieſt that he would prove there before the People, what he had open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accuſed him of, <hi>viz. That he had ſaid, there was no Original Sin.</hi> But the Prieſt would not anſwer, but fled away.

ſaid to <hi>Dewsbury, What art thou here for?</hi> And <hi>Dewsbury</hi> anſwered, <hi>The Mittimus will expreſs what I was committed for; but a Copy of it I am denied by the Keeper of the Jail.</hi> The next Query of the Judge was, <hi>What is thy Name?</hi> And the Anſwer was, <hi>

               <hi>Nine Miles from</hi> York, <hi>towards</hi> Hull.

But,</hi> ſaid the Judge, <hi>the Apoſtles wrought with their Hands in their Callings. They had,</hi> anſwer'd Dewsbury, <hi>Callings in the World, ſome were Fiſhermen,</hi> Paul <hi>a Tent-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker; but when they were called to the Miniſtry of Chriſt, they left their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, to follow Chriſt, whither he led them by his Spirit to preach the Word: And I had a Calling in the World, as they had, and in it did abide, until the Father revealed his Son in me, and called me from my Calling I had in the World, to preach the eternal Word he had made known to me in the great Work of Regeneration. Why,</hi> queried the Judge, <hi>didſt thou not abide in thy own Country, and teach People in them Parts? There I did ſtay,</hi> returned Dewsbury, <hi>until I was called from thence to go where I was led by the Spirit of the Lord;</hi> and as many as are led by the Spirit of God, are the Sons and Daughters of God; <hi>and they that have not the Spirit of Chriſt are none of his.</hi> To this the Judge ſaid, <hi>You ſay well; for we muſt in Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity conclude, that every one in this Place hath the Spirit of God in him: But how do you know that you are guided by the Spirit of God? They that have the Spirt of God,</hi> replied Dewsbury, <hi>are known by their Fruits; and he that believeth in Jeſus Chriſt, and is guided by his Spirit, hath the Witneſs in himſelf. That is true,</hi> ſaid the Judge, <hi>yet notwithſtanding, I ſee by your Carriage, that what my Brother</hi> Hale <hi>did at the laſt Aſſizes, in requiring Bond for your good Behaviour, he might juſtly do it; for you are againſt Magiſtrates and Miniſters.</hi> But <hi>Dewsbury</hi> returned, <hi>Make that manifeſt wherein we are againſt them.</hi> Then ſaid the Judge to the Clerk, <hi>Robert Guy, What have you againſt theſe Men?</hi> And he gave Relation of what <hi>Dews<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> had ſaid to the Prieſt <hi>Andrews</hi> in the Steeple-houſe. <hi>Dewsbury</hi> then giving an Account of the Matter of Fact, and how the Thing happened; and that it was not any Breach of the Law of the Nation; the Judge reſumed, <hi>But in that you are found wandering in the Country, you break the Law; for there is an old Law, That if any did go from their Dwellings to travel in the Country without a Certificate from ſome Juſtice, they were to be taken as wandring Perſons.</hi> To this, <hi>Dewsbury</hi> ſaid, <hi>If there be any ſuch Law, read it to us; and if there be ſuch a Law, thou knoweſt in thy Conſcience it is contrary to the Scripture; for the Apoſtles and Miniſters of Chriſt went to and fro in the Country preaching the Word of eternal Life; and there were added to the Church daily ſuch as ſhould be ſaved; and the Number of the Saints and Brethren was daily encreaſed: And the Law that is in Force in this Nation, doth allow all that profeſs Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, to have free Liberty to walk in the Faith, which is according to Scripture.</hi>

            <p>From <hi>London</hi> he went to <hi>Leiceſterſhire;</hi> and coming to <hi>Whetſtone,</hi> where formerly he had been taken by Colonel <hi>Hacker,</hi> he now had a great Meeting there,<note place="margin">Thence to <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſterſhire.</hi> Has a great Meeting at <hi>Whetſtone,</hi> where Colonel <hi>Hacker's</hi> Wife, his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more are convinc'd.

            <p>In this Year <hi>Edward Burrough</hi> wrote a Letter to the Protector, wherein he told him, <hi>That the Lord's Controverſy was againſt him, becauſe he had not been faithful in God's Work; but that he had taken his Reſt and Eaſe upon a lofty Mountain of Pride and Vain Glory, having ſet up himſelf to be worſhipped, and exalting his own Horn, without giving Glory and Honour to God.</hi> Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, <hi>that he had not perform'd his Vows made to the Lord in the Day of Diſtreſs; and that now he ſuffered grievous Oppreſſion, Cruelty, and Tyranny to be acted in his Name by unjuſt Impriſonments, and Perſecution of the Lord's People. That therefore the Lord would bring his Judgments upon him, except be did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</hi> How boldly ſoever <hi>Burrough</hi> wrote in this Letter to <hi>Cromwel,</hi> yet I do not find that he ſhewed himſelf angry becauſe of it: But yet he heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened too much to the Flatteries of thoſe Teachers, who being now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Poſſeſſions of the <hi>Epiſcopalians,</hi> exalted him as their Idol, by their Applauſe: And he revering them as ſuch who could ſtrengthen his Authority with the People, winked at the grievous Perſecution, by their Inſtigation carried on againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſo called.</p>
            <p>In the mean While there were many Malecontents, who could not bear that <hi>Cromwel</hi> ſhould force the Members of Parliament to conſent to make no Change in the Government then eſtabliſh'd,<note place="margin">Publick Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions.</note> and would not ſuffer any one to ſit in the Houſe, without having promiſed by Writing not to propoſe or give his Conſent there to the Change of the ſaid Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. This gave Occaſion, that even ſome of thoſe who had been his eminent Friends, now did not ſtick to reprove him ſharply: Among theſe was Lieutenant Colonel <hi>John Lilburn,</hi>

               </note> who being an extraordinary bold Man, very ſtiff and inflexible, had more than once ſhew'd himſelf a publick Aſſertor of the People's Liberties and Freedoms; for which he had been proſecuted at Law, <hi>viz.</hi> once in the Year 1645, when he was
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:003104_0132_0FEFF456D755A5E8"/>
publick Aſſertor of the People's Liberties and Freedoms; for which he had been proſcuted at Law, <hi>viz.</hi> once in the Year 1645, when he was impriſoned as guilty of Treaſon, but was diſcharged; and afterwards in the Year 1649, when having publiſh'd ſeveral Books, to expoſe to the Publick, the arbitrary Power he thought was exerciſed in the Government, he was confined in the Tower: And after having been Priſoner above ſeven Months, was impeach'd of High Treaſon: But he ſo vigorouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended his Cauſe, that tho' ſtrong Perſwaſions had been uſed to move the Jury to bring him in guilty, yet he ſo far prevailed, that at length he was ſet at Liberty again; tho' I find that once he was whipt for a Crime laid to his Charge, of which he gloried publickly. And when <hi>Cromwel</hi> had uſurp'd the ſupreme Power, <hi>Lilburn</hi> made bold to charge him, both by Word of Mouth, and by Writing, with Falſeneſs and Tyranny; and he went on at that Rate, that <hi>Cromwel,</hi> foreſeeing that, it this Man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd thus to expoſe his Doings, he ſhould not be able to maintain his Credit and Authority, ordered him to be taken into Cuſtody and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach'd of High Treaſon. When <hi>Lilburn,</hi> thus accuſed, appeared at the Bar, he behaved himſelf with that Undauntedneſs, and ſo defended his Cauſe, that, he ſeemed leſs to plead for his Life, than for the Freedom of his Country: And boldly anſwering what was objected to him, ſaid, <q>That what he had done, was not only no High Treaſon, but the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was ſuch, that no High Treaſon could be committed againſt it; and that therefore all true <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> were obliged to oppoſe the Tyranny that was exerciſed.</q> He alſo ſaid, <q>That having been once much in Favour with <hi>Cromwel,</hi> he might have attained to great Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if he would have been quiet; but that he having thought this unlawful, it was now reſolved to have his Life taken away; which he did not fear, becauſe he aſſerted a good Cauſe.</q> Thus vigorouſly <hi>Lilburn</hi> pleaded, and he defended his Cauſe with ſuch ſtrong Arguments, that the Jury brought him in <hi>not guilty,</hi> notwithſtanding the Endeavours of the Judges to the contrary. Now, tho' according to Law he muſt have been ſet at Liberty, yet <hi>Cromwel</hi> would not conſent to it, but kept him Priſoner; and becauſe he indeed feared him, as one that would weaken his Government, he ordered him to be carried from one Priſon to another, till at length he came to be confined in the Caſtle of <hi>Dover,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Who while Priſoner in <hi>Dover-Caſtle</hi> comes to be acquainted with <hi>L.

            </p>
            <p>Theſe Words were ſo acceptable to <hi>Lilburn,</hi> that repeating them in his Letter to her, he anſwered thus, after many other Paſſages:</p>

And whether they had the ſame Spirit and Power, that the Apoſtles had?</hi> They ſaid, <hi>They had not.</hi> Then he asked them, <hi>How many Powers then are? Whether there are any more, than the Power of God, and the Power of the Devil?</hi> And they ſaid, <hi>There was not any other Power than thoſe two.</hi> Then ſaid <hi>G. Fox, If you have not the Power of God, that the Apoſtles had, then you act by the Power of the Devil.</hi> And his ſpeaking was of ſuch Effect, that many Subſtantial People were convinced that Night. Next Morning when he was paſſing away, the Baptiſts began to ſhake the Duſt from off their Feet after him. <hi>What,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>in the Power of Darkneſs! We who are in the Power of God, ſhake off the Duſt of our Feet againſt you.</hi> Thus leaving <hi>Dorcheſter</hi> he came to <hi>Weymouth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Then to <hi>Wey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> where at a Prieſt's Houſe many receive his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony; and alſo a Captain remarkable for Laughter.</note> where enquiring after the ſober People, about Fourſcore of them gathered together at a Prieſt's Houſe; and moſt of them were turned to Chriſt Jeſus, who had enlightened them with his divine Light, by which they were reproved of their Sins. There was at that Time a Captain of Horſe in the Town, who rode about ſeven Miles out of Town with <hi>G. Fox:</hi> This Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain was of ſuch a merry Temper, and ſo exceedingly given to Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that <hi>G. Fox</hi> ſeveral Times ſpoke very ſeriouſly to him about it; but it was become ſo cuſtomary to him, that he would laugh al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt at any Thing he ſaw. But <hi>G. Fox</hi> ſtill admoniſh'd him to Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Fear of the Lord; and of this he ſpoke to him again when they parted. The next Time <hi>G. Fox</hi> ſaw him, the Captain told him, <hi>That when he ſpoke to him at parting, the Power of the Lord ſo ſtruck him, that before he got home, he was ſerious enough, and had left his Laughing.</hi> He indeed became a ſerious and good Man; and being convinced of the Truth, died in the real Profeſſion thereof.</p>
            <p>For Brevities-Sake I don't intend to mention all the Places <hi>G. Fox</hi> paſt thro',<note place="margin">Has good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice at Kings<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge.</note> much leſs all his Occurrences. At <hi>Kingsbridge</hi> he had good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and returning in the Evening to his Inn, and there being many People drinking, he was moved to go amongſt them, and to direct them <q>To the Light which Chriſt, the heavenly Man, had enlightened them withal; by which Light they might ſee all their evil Ways, Words.

and Deeds: and by the ſame Light they might alſo ſee Chriſt Jeſus their Saviour.</q> But this Diſcourſe did not pleaſe the Inn-keeper, ſeeing it hindred his Gueſts from drinking: And hearing <hi>G. Fox</hi> ſpeak ſo much of the Light, he ſnatcht away the Candle, and ſaid, <hi>Come, here is Light for you, to go into your Chamber.</hi> The next Day <hi>G.

They ſaying nothing; <hi>Put off your Hats,</hi> ſaid the Judge again: And they ſtill continuing ſilent, the Judge ſaid, <hi>The Court commands you to put off your Hats.</hi> Then <hi>G.

I ll ferk him.</hi> Then the Priſoners were taken away, and put among the Thieves. But preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the Judge call'd to the Jailor, <hi>Bring them up again.</hi> This being done, <hi>Come,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>Where had they Hats from</hi> Moſes <hi>to</hi> Daniel? <hi>Come anſwer me; I have you faſt now.</hi> To this <hi>G.

Fox</hi> ſeeing the Jurymen there, gave them a Paper which he had written againſt Swearing. This Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per paſſing from the Jury to the Juſtices, they preſented it to the Judge; and he bid the Clerk give <hi>G.

And;</hi> ſaid G. Fox, <hi>as for Putting off our Hats, that was the Honour which God would lay in the</hi> Duſt, <hi>tho' they made ſo much ado about it: The Honour which is of Men, and which Men ſeek one of another is the Mark of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers:</hi> For how can ye believe, <hi>ſaith Chriſt,</hi> who receive Honour one of another, and ſeek not the Honour that cometh from God only? <hi>And Chriſt ſaith alſo,</hi> I receive not Honour from Men, <hi>and all true Chriſtians ſhould be of his Mind.</hi> Then the Judge made a Speech, <hi>How he repreſented the Lord</hi> Protector's <hi>Perſon; and how he had made him Lord Chief Juſtice of</hi> England, <hi>and ſent him to come that Circuit; &amp;c.</hi> Thereupon the Priſoners deſired him, <hi>That he would do them Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice for their falſe Impriſonment, which they had ſuffered nine Weeks.</hi> But inſtead thereof, an Indictment was read againſt them, but ſo full of Untruths, that <hi>G Fox</hi> thought it had been againſt ſome of the Thieves; for it contained, <hi>That they came by Force and Arms, and in an hoſtile Manner into the Court;</hi> whereas they were brought there as Priſoners; which made him ſay, <hi>It was all falſe.</hi> And ſtill they cried for Juſtice for their falſe lmpriſonment, being taken up in their Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney without Cauſe, by Major <hi>Ceely.</hi> Then this <hi>Peter Ceely,</hi> who as a Juſtice of Peace ſat alſo on the Bench,<note place="margin">The fooliſh malice of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor <hi>Ceely.</hi>

            <p>The Judge by this ſeeing clearly that <hi>Ceely,</hi> inſtead of enſnaring <hi>Fox,</hi> had enſnared himſelf, let fall that Buſineſs.

A Report of this Trial being ſpread abroad, divers People, of whom ſome were of Account in the World, came far and near to ſee him and his Friends in Priſon, which tended to the Convincement of ſome. Being ſettled in Priſon upon ſuch a Commitment, that they were not likely to be ſoon releaſed, they forbore giving the Jailor ſeven Shillings a Week a-piece for themſelves, and as much for their Horſes, which he had in a Manner extorted from them: But upon this he grew ſo very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At Night ſome friendly People of the Town brought them a Candle, and a little Straw; of which they were about to burn a little to take away the Stink. The Thieves lay over their Heads, and the Head-Jailor in a Room by them over their Heads alſo. But it ſeems the Smoak went up into the Room where he lay, which put him into ſuch a Rage, that he took the Pots of the Thieves Excrements, and poured them down thro' a Hole upon their Heads; whereby they were ſo beſpattered, that it was loathſome to touch themſelves, or one another: beſides, the Stink ſo encreaſed, that by it, and the Smoak, they were almoſt in Danger of being ſuffocated. And all this could not ſatisfy the Rage of this cruel Jailor, but he railed againſt them ſo hideouſly, and called them by ſuch horrible nick Names, that they never had heard the like before.

And even this could not be done without Difficulty; for a Laſs one Time having brought them a little Meat, he ſued her in the Town-Court for breaking the Priſon; perhaps, becauſe ſhe had a little bent an half-broken Bar of the Grate, to get a ſmall Diſh thro' it. That this Jailor was ſo deſperately wicked, is not ſo much to be wondred at, ſince (as they were inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) he had been a Thief, and was on that Account burnt both in the Hand and on the Shoulder; and the Under-Jailor in like Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: Their Wives had alſo been burnt in the Hand. It was not at all ſtrange then, that the Priſoners ſuffererd moſt grievouſly from ſuch a wicked Crew: But it was more to be wondered at, that Colonel <hi>Bennet,</hi> a <hi>Baptiſt</hi> T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Scarce had he ſpoken thus much, but ſome cried, <hi>A Quaker! a Quaker! keep him down, he ſhall not ſpeak:</hi> Yet the Protector and the Parliament-men were ſtill and quiet.

So the Adverſary got Advantage, who ceaſes not to ſeek to devour; and being taken captive from the true Light, I was walking in the Night where none can work, as a wandring Bird fit for a Prey. And if the Lord of all my Mercies had not reſcu'd me, I had periſhed, for I was as one appointed to Death and Deſtruction, and there was none could deliver me. And this I confeſs, that God my be juſtified in his Judgment, and magnified in his Mercies without End, who did not forſake his Captive in the Night, even when his Spirit was daily provoked and grieved; but hath brought me forth to give Glory to his Name for ever. And it is in my Heart to confeſs to God, and before Men, my Folly and Offence in that Day: Yet were there many Things formed againſt me in that Day to take away my Life, and bring Scandal upon the Truth, of which I am not guilty at all; as that Accuſation, as if I had committed Adultery with ſome of thoſe Women who came with us from <hi>Exeter-Priſon,</hi> and alſo thoſe who were with me at <hi>Briſtol</hi> the Night before I ſuffered there; of both which Accuſations I am clear before God, who kept me in that Day both in Thought and Deed, as to all Women, as a Child, God is my Record.

And this I give forth, that it may go as far as the Offence againſt the Spirit of Truth hath gone abroad, that all Burdens may be taken off with the Truth, and the Truth cleared thereby, and the true Light, and all that walk therein, and the Deeds of Darkneſs be condemned; and that all that are in Darkneſs, may not act in the Night, but ſtay upon God, who dwells in the Light, who with the Workers of Iniquity hath no Fellowſhip; which had I done, when firſt Darkneſs came upon me, and not been led by others, I had not run againſt the Rock to be broken, which ſo long had born me, and of whom I had ſo largely drunk, and of which I now drink in Meaſure; to whom be the Glory of all, and to him muſt every Tongue confeſs, as Judge and Saviour, God over all, bleſſed for ever.</p>

And after I was led out from them, the Lord God of my Life ſent divers of his Servants with his Word after me, for my Return; all which was rejected; yea, the Provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Time of Temptation was exceeding great againſt the pure Love of God; yet he left me not; for after I had given my ſelf under that Power, and Darkneſs was above, my Adverſary ſo prevailed, that all Things were turned and perverted againſt my right Seeing or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding; only a ſecret Hope and Faith I had in my God which I had ſerved, that he would bring me thro' it, and to the End of it, and that I ſhould again ſee the Day of my Redemption from under it all; and this quieted my Soul in my greateſt Tribulation.</hi>

a Terror to them which do Evil? Juſtice is ſo. And he that is of God, and bears his Sword, turns the Edge of it againſt all Sin and Wickedneſs, Injuſtice and Oppreſſion, and ſo ſets up Juſitce and Judgment in the Gates, that the Poor may be deliver'd from him that is too mighty for him, and that the Cauſe of the Fatherleſs, Widow and Stranger may not fall; but hath an Ear open to the Cries of the Poor and Helpleſs, who hath but little Money, and few Friends; that a poor Man may not be afraid to appear in a good Cauſe, againſt the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Oppreſſor in the Nation.</p>
               <p>And ought not you to judge without Reſpect to Perſons, or without ſeeking Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to your own Perſons, Worſhip or Honour from Men, but only to advance Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, Equity, and Righteouſneſs, which is of God, that ſo you may be honour'd by the Lord? for true Humility is Honour, and he that honours the Lord, him will he honour; and ſuch hath been honour'd in all Ages, tho' they never ſought it from Men.</p>
            </q>
            <p>This and much more he wrote to the Rulers. And to the Preachers thus:
<q>And you who ſay, you are the Teachers of the Nation, How long will it be ere you look at your own Ways?

Is there not among you Drunkenneſs, Gluttony, Whoredom, and Sporting, Sitting down to eat and to drink, and riſing up to play; Swearing, Lying, Backbiting, falſe Accuſing, Railing, Slandering, Contention, Strife and Envy? Yea, are not the beſt of you given to Pride and Covetouſneſs, which is Idolatry, Fulneſs of Bread, and Abundance of Idleneſs? Are not you Hirelings, and teach for the Fleece? Do not you contend for Money with your own Hearers, and ſue them at Law for it; yea, altho' they cannot ſatisfy your Demand, without ſinning againſt the Light in their own Conſcience, and ſo ſin againſt God? Are you not bitter, and Perſecutors of any that come to diſcover your Lewdneſs, crying out to the Magiſtrate to uphold you in your beaſtly Ways, and to ſtop the Mouths of all thoſe whom God hath ſent to witneſs againſt you? And many more Works of this Nature are among you, which the pure All-ſeeing God hath ſhewed unto his People to be amongſt you; and therefore it is that they come out from you, leſt they partake with you of your Sins and Plagues. But are not you blind Leaders of the blind, when you neither ſee theſe to be the Works of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor thoſe that follow you.

<q>And you Lawyers, ought not you to plead the Cauſe of Equity between Man and Man for Equity Sake, without Reſpect to your ſelves or others, but only to Truth it ſelf, that a juſt Cauſe may be owned in whomſoever it concerns? But is not the juſteſt Cauſe ſure to fall, if the Party have not Money to ſatisfy your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, which are many Times very unreaſonable? And you who ſhould inſtruct People in the Ways of Truth and Peace, do not you by your Wiſdom teach them Lies and Strife? Do not you adviſe your Plantiffs, as you call them, to declare in Bills, Things that are not true, and make ſmall Offences ſeem very great by falſe Gloſſes? For ſay you, <hi>We may declare what we will, and prove what we can;</hi> ſo that you, and they whom you act for, know before hand, that ſcarce one Thing of Ten can be proved, neither is true? Is this the Way to <hi>make up the Breach, and preſerve Peace and Truth among People?</hi> O miſerable Fall from God, when that Law which ſhould before pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in Peace, is uſed to aggravate Offences beyond Truth, and ſo make Differences greater.

And are not thoſe Laws which ought to be uſed to preſerve People from Oppreſſion, by abuſing, made the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndoing of whole Families, impoveriſhing Towns and Countries? The Law, as it is now uſed, is ſcarce ſerviceable for any other End but for the envious Man, who hath much Money to revenge himſelf of his poor Neighbours, which, may be, never did him Wrong?

O when will you ceaſe to provoke the Lord by your Sins? Where is your Redeemer you have profeſſed ſo long in Words and Forms? Can you witneſs him in your Works? And what hath he redeemed you from? For ſaith he, <hi>Why call you me Lord, and do not the Things which I ſay?</hi> Is he your Lord, and you Servants to all Manner of Filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?

How many falſe Oaths, and idle Words are ſpent about every Bargain in your Markets, and open Streets, without bluſhing, or being aſhamed? Yea, it is able to break the Hearts of any who know the Pure God, to know it, and hear it, for it is come to ſuch a Height of Deceit, that none can truſt his Brother; for Lying, Swearing, and Forſwearing, it abounds in the Nation; and yet you will profeſs your ſelves to be the Members of Jeſus Chriſt: And had Jeſus Chriſt ever ſuch a Body as this?

are redeemed, yet commit all theſe Abominations, and live in them, under a Pretence of a Profeſſion, and going to the Idols Temple once a Week: Did ever Jeſus Chriſt redeem ſuch a People, or dwell in ſuch a People? Thoſe whom he hath redeemed, he hath freed from the Servitude of Sin, by ſeparating them from Sin, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling them to God, from whence they are fallen by Sin; for God and Sin cannot dwell in one. And to ſuch he ſaith, <hi>Be ye holy, for I am holy:</hi> And as he is the <hi>Lamb of God who taketh away the Sins of the World:</hi> Now ſee, how is your Sins taken away, when the Kingdom, of Darkneſs doth wholly rule in you, and leads you into Works and Ways of Darkneſs? Are you reconciled to God, and have you Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with him? Are not you yet Strangers to him, and worſhip an unknown God? <hi>For he that commits Sin, hath not ſeen him, neither known him,</hi> and ſo worſhip they know not what, in formal and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Worſhips.</q>

            <p>So zealous was he before his Fall, which was wholly of another Nature than the common Sins and Tranſgreſſions: For by the Wiles of Satan he accepted the idolatrous Honour that ſome Perſons gave him, inſtead of which he ought to have reproved them: And thus was he ſo ſtupified in his Underſtanding, that he imagin'd the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and kneeling before him, was not done on Account of his Perſon, but for Chriſt: And with this falſe Opinion he blinded himſelf for a Time, till it pleas'd God to pity him, and to give him Light again, after he had ſuffer'd ſuch an unheard of Puniſhment for his Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, as is already related in this Hiſtory. And becauſe his Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Speech againſt Unrighteouſneſs of all Sorts, and his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ran very ſharp upon all, ſeveral were angry with him, became his Enemies, and took Occaſion from his Crime to revenge themſelves fiercely upon him, by making him ſuffer a cruel Puniſhment, which was no Ways proportionable to his Tranſgreſſion.

                        <p>I ſay then, what is become of your ſpiritual Weapons? Have not your Teachers told People of the Strength of Truth, and the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Godlineſs? Have you loſt both (may Wiſdom ſay) and run you now to the Arm of Fleſh, to get <hi>Errors ſtifled</hi> (as you call them) or elſe your Hope is loſt, and your Faith fails you? Did ever any of Chriſt's Miniſters leave their ſpiritual Weapons, to run to the Arm of Fleſh, or a carnal Weapon to ſtop Seducers? I ſay, No; this they never did, but with ſpiritual Weapons they wreſtled and overcame ſpiritual Wickedneſs, and with them cut down Hereſies, Blaſphemies, and falſe Worſhips, and cleared the Churches of Chriſt of them, and drove them down before them in the World: <hi>For none could reſiſt the Spirit by which they ſpoke,</hi> of all the falſe Prieſts, and falſe Worſhippers: But being put to the worſt, they cried (as you do) to Rulers and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Help us, or all will be over-run: For they that turn the World upſide down are come hither;</hi> [Mind your Cry.] And then the rude Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude ran on Heaps upon them, and made Tumults often, and fell upon them with Staves and Fiſts, and aſſaulted the Houſes that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd them, as you do, and ſo haled them before Rulers, who took their Part herein, and put them in Priſon, and often whipp'd them, unleſs it were ſome that were ſo noble, as not to heed the Cry of the Multitude; but would hear their Cauſe, and give them Leave to ſpeak, before they would ſentence them that were accuſed.

Surely it may be ſaid, you have been bad Watchmen, and idle Shepherds, who have loſt all, if ſudden Help come not from another Hand. Now if any had come againſt you with carnal Weapons, then had you had ſome Excuſe in crying to the Earthly Powers; but in that, nothing but Spirit comes againſt Spirit, and yet you have loſt the Day. This doth clearly manifeſt, that the Power of God you have not in you, but have loſt the Kingdom of the Moſt High, and ſo are become unreaſonable Men, who would have two Weapons againſt one, and another to do your Work for you, and yet are unwilling to forgo your Wages; yea, this Advantage you have had divers Years, but have not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed therewith.</p>

                        <p>And whereas you now ſay, <hi>That none but a Regal Authority can ſtifle;</hi> It's true, you have tried Parliaments and Protectors (as you called them) and Parliaments again; and to make them then work for you, your Prieſts uſed theſe Arguments to them, (to wit,) <hi>That in the late Wars they had expoſed Lives, Liberties, Eſtates, and Relations, with all other perſonal Advantages, in maintaining the juſt Proceedings of Parliaments,</hi> and from them you then claimed our <hi>Stifling,</hi> as the Price of your <hi>Prayers, Purſes, Hazards, Loſſes, Baniſhment</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> as may be read in the <hi>Weſtmorland</hi> Petition againſt us, which thou haſt printed in Page 197, and 198. And was not this Power that which you then called the <hi>common Enemy,</hi> in the ſame Petition, <hi>p.</hi> 200, which you now cry to, and would put him upon that Work againſt us now, as Defender of your Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ah! faithleſs Generation have you been to God and Man, may you not be aſhamed of this Work, to print it and ſend it to King <hi>Charles,</hi> and call him to defend it, and patronize it: How hath Envy bereaved you of your Reaſonableneſs? Shall he who defends this, defend either Faith or Truth? But this is that you may cover your ſelves with your Shame and Envy, that both King and People, and Parliaments, may ſee what a Generation you are, that will run under any Power to get your bloody Ends; but indeed true to none; for if it was true, that you were ſo faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to that Parliament, with your Prayers, Purſes, and Blood, as there you plead, then is your Faith but new, which now you would have defended; but if not true, then how great Deceivers, and how little to be truſted, or defended in your cruel Deſigns.</p>

and that <hi>the Prophets ſhall be aſhamed, every one of his Viſion,</hi> Zach. <hi>xiii. 4.</hi> The which doth now evidently appear, and their <hi>Folly is made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt unto all</hi> that will ſee and behold it, according to 2 <hi>Tim. iii. 9.</hi> And is not this manifeſt Madneſs and Folly in them, called Orthodox and Divines, to preſent unto the King their Packet of Lies, which have been ſeven Years told over, and ſo long ſince diſproved and confuted, as may be ſeen in a Book called, <hi>Saul's Errand to Damaſcus,</hi> &amp;c. printed in the Year 1653, and in ſeveral other Books ſince.

But this we know, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it is written, <hi>Prov. xxix. 12, 19.</hi> That <hi>if a Ruler hearken to Lies, all his Servants are wicked; but a wiſe King ſcattereth the Wicked, and bringeth the Wheel over them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Theſe pretended Divines, are ſuch as have bowed and crouched under eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Appearance of a Power, and by Flatteries ſeem to cleave unto them, that they might uphold, maintain, and ſatisfy their God, which is their Bellies: Theſe were of them which ſaid, that <hi>Oliver Cromwel was the Light of their Eyes, and the Breath of their Noſtrils:</hi> So that now with Shame they might rather confeſs that they are blind, and dead (from the Light and Life of God) than to multiply Lies in their accuſtomed Manner as formerly.

And thoſe former Rulers hearkening to their Lies, were deceived by them, which was the Cauſe of God's Judgments, and utter De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction coming upon them; which while they put into the Prieſts Mouths, they cried, <hi>Peace</hi> unto them, calling them <hi>Moſes, Aaron,</hi> and <hi>Joſhua;</hi> but when they ceaſed, and could not put into their Mouths, then they cried out, that <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> were <hi>Tyrants</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſors:</hi> And ſo will they do unto the King now, who are ſeeking to cleave unto him by Flattery and Deceit; which if he deny to be the Patron and Defender of their Lies, will be apt to cry as much againſt him. So that he, or they, are bleſſed, whoſe Ears are not open to their Clamours, but whoſe Hearts are joined to the Truth, and who are led by the Spirit of God as their Inſtructor; for ſuch ſhall diſcern Hypocrites, and falſe Hearted Men, under every Pretence of Flattery or Diſſimulation; for the <hi>Folly</hi> of theſe begins to <hi>be manifeſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Men,</hi> 2 Tim. <hi>iii. 9.</hi>

<pb n="154" facs="unknown:003104_0165_0FEFF4C5DA4F5230"/>
who purſued my Soul unto Death (as much as in them lay) in that Day of my Calamity, when my Adverſary was above, and wherein I was made a Sign to a backſliding Generation, who then would not ſee nor hear what now is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them, but rejoiced againſt this Piece of Duſt, and had little Pity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him that was fallen into their Hands; wherein God was juſt in giving me up for my Diſobedience, for a little Moment, as a Father to correct; yet ſhould not they have ſought to aggravate Things againſt me, as thou doſt; for it was a Day of deep Diſtreſs, and lay ſore upon my Soul, and the merciful God ſaw it, who, tho' he was diſpleaſed for a Time, yet his Thoughts were not to caſt off for ever <hi>(but extend Mercy)</hi> as it is at this Day, Glory be to his Name, from my delivered Soul, eternally.</p>
                        <p>And in that Day there were many Spirits flock'd about me, and ſome whom, while the Candle of the Lord ſhone upon my Head, I ever judged and kept out from me, who then got up and acted, and ſpoke ſeveral Things not in the Light and Truth of God, by which they, who ſought Occaſion againſt me, were then ſtrengthened to afflict this Body; and he that watches for Evil, in thee and ſome others, makes <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe on ſtill againſt God's Truth and innocent People; whoſe Mouths the God of my Mercy ſtop, and ſo finiſh the Trouble of my Heart as to that Thing, for my Soul hath long dwelt among Lions, even among them that are ſet on Fire, <hi>whoſe Teeth are Spears and Arrows, and their Tongues a ſharp Sword, ſpeaking miſchievous Things to ſhed Blood.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But O Man, or Men, whoever you be, whoſe Work it is to gather the Fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of God's People in the Time of Temptation, or Night of their Trial, and aggravate them, and add thereto the Wickedneſs and miſchievous Lies of your own Hearts, as thou haſt done in thy Book, and then come out with thoſe againſt God's everlaſting holy Truth, it to reproach; I ſay, you are ſet on work by an evil Spirit, and you do but ſhew your ſelves to be Enemies to God and his Children; and it is our Sorrow, that any of us ſhould give ſuch Spirits Occaſion to blaſpheme; and it hath been Trouble of Soul to all the People of God, that have ever loved Righteouſneſs, when they have thus occaſioned the Joy of the Wicked, or to feed the Man that watches for Iniquity, and feeds on Miſchief: Yet know this, you that are of that Brood, God will not caſt off his People; tho' he be ſometimes provoked to correct them, even before their Adverſaries,(which is a Sign to them) yet is his Anger but for a Moment, and his Favour ſhall <hi>return as Streams of Life;</hi> then ſhall the <hi>Food be taken out of the Mouth of the Viper, and the Prey from between the Teeth of the Devourers;</hi> and God will feed them with their own Vomit, and the Poiſon that hath long lain under their Tongues, ſhall be bitter in their own Bowels. Thus will God certainly <hi>plead with</hi> Zion<hi>'s Enemies, as he bends her Sons for himſelf, and God will make up her Breaches:</hi> And this hath my Soul ſeen, <hi>Jacob's Captivity reſtored, and the Diggers of the Pit are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len therein;</hi> neither hath he ſmitten him as he ſmote them that ſmote him, nor is he ſlain according to the Slaughter of them that are ſlain by him; but this is all <hi>His Fruit to purge away his Sin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So he that had long watched for my faltering, then got Advantage againſt me; yet had I then Power to bear his utmoſt Envy, thro' <hi>Chriſt Jeſus, whom I then confeſſed before Men,</hi> who then was my Support in all, and under all, and who is over all, bleſſed for ever of all who have proved him in the Depth.</p>
                        <p>But that which was, and is the Sorrow of my Heart, is the Advantage the Enemy then took againſt the Name of Chriſt, his Truth, and his deſpiſed Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in that Time of Temptation, which is that which thou art now purſuing with Hatred and Lies, as <hi>That I was ſuſpected to have a Woman in Bed with me, the Night before I ſuffered at</hi> Briſtol, when there were ſix or ſeven Perſons in the Room that Night, and a Man (to wit) <hi>Robert Rich</hi> in Bed with me. But this, and ſeveral other falſe things thou haſt written in thy Book, of which I am clear before the Lord, ſo they touch me not at all; nor ſhall I here mention them againſt thee in particular; but to God alone I look, in his

Time to be cleared from all Offences in his Sight, who only knows my Heart in this Thing, in whoſe Preſence I can ſay, that nothing is more odious and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome to my Soul, than that any of the Glory or Worſhip which belongs to God, or to Chriſt, ſhould be given to Fleſh and Blood, in my ſelf, or others: And how it was with me at that Day, many talk of, but few know; ſo the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch I bear; deſiring that none in judging me, might have condemned themſelves in God's Sight, whoſe <hi>Counſels are a great Deep, and the End of his Work paſt finding out,</hi> till he himſelf reveal them; but in the End he will be juſtified of all, and in all he doth, that all Fleſh may be ſilent before him.</p>
                        <p>And however my ſelf, or any others my be left to themſelves, to be tried in the Night, yea, ſhould any utterly fall, or whatever may be acted by any Man or Woman, that is not juſtifiable in God's Sight, yet in vain doſt thou, or you, gather up Sin, or watch for Iniquity, to caſt upon the Light which condemns it in every enlighten'd Conſcience, and there will clear himſelf to be no Author nor Actor therein; and I know by the Spirit of Jeſus, which I have received, and which worketh in me, that this is not his Work, nor his Seed, nor in him that loves his Enemies, thou art not; but the old <hi>Accuſer of the Brethren</hi> it is that worketh ſtrongly in thee; and in the Light which thou reproacheſt, art thou ſeen to be <hi>the Man that makes Lies, and carries Tales to ſhed Blood, Ezek. xxii. 9, 12.</hi>

                  <hi>J.

Then Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs came over him, and he did ſuffer himſelf to be accounted above what he ought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Here he ſlipt, and fell, but not irrecoverably; for it did pleaſe God of his infinite Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, in the Day of his Affliction, to give him a Sight and Senſe of his Outgoings and Fall, and alſo a place of Repentance. And he, with the Prodigal, humbled himſelf for his Tranſgreſſion, and beſought God with true Contrition of Soul, to pardon his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences thro' Jeſus Chriſt. God, I firmly believe, forgave him, for he pardons the truly Penitent. His People receiv'd him with great Joy, for that he who had gone aſtray from God, was now return'd to the Father's Houſe, and for that he who had ſeparated himſelf from them thro' his Iniquity, was now thro' Repentance and forſaking of it, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into the Unity of the Faith, and their Holy Fellowſhip in the Goſpel of Chriſt. And I do hereby teſtifie, that I do eſteem it a particular Mark of God's owning his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in bringing back into Unity with them, a Man who had ſo dangerouſly fallen, as did <hi>James Naylor.</hi> And here let none inſult, but take Heed leſt they alſo, in the Hour of their Temptation, do fall away: Nor let any boaſtingly ſay, where is your God?

            <p>Such was the Entertainment the <hi>Quakers</hi> firſt met with at <hi>Boſton,</hi> and that from a People who pretended, that for Conſcience-Sake they had choſen the Wilderneſſes of <hi>America,</hi> before the well-cultivated <hi>Old England;</hi> tho' afterwards, when they took away the Lives of thoſe called <hi>Quakers,</hi> they, to excuſe their cruel Actions, did not ſtick to ſay, that at firſt they had uſed no Puniſhment againſt the <hi>Quakers.</hi>

And many excluded Members having taken Place again in the Houſe of Commons, it was believed that more than an Hundred of the Members were Enemies to <hi>Cromwel;</hi> and the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Upper Houſe began to be called in Queſtion by ſome, becauſe it was fill'd up with many of his Creatures, ſome of them of low Rank.

                  <p>I as one that hath obtain'd Mercy from the Lord,<note place="margin">1657</note> and unto whom his Word is committed, being moved of him, do hereby in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, yet once more warn thee, that thou fear before him, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently hearken to him, and ſeek him with all thy Heart, that thou may'ſt know his Will and Counſel concerning thee, and may'ſt do it, and find Favour in his Sight, and live. Now is the Day that his Hand is ſtretched forth unto thee, to make thee a Bleſſing, or to leave thee a Curſe for ever; and the Days of thy Viſitation are near an End, when God will no more call unto thee, nor hear thee, when in the Day of thy Trouble thou call'ſt to him.— And if thou rejecteſt the Counſel of the Lord, and followeſt the Deſires of thine own Heart, and the Wills of Men, and wilt not have the Light of the World, Chriſt Jeſus, only to rule thee, and to teach thee, which condemns all Evil, then ſhall Evil ſurely fall upon thee, if thou loveſt not the Light in thee, which condemns it; and the Judgments of God, nor the Day of his laſt Viſitation with Vengeance thou may'ſt not eſcape. Therefore conſider, and mark my Words, and let this Counſel be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable unto thee; let it move thee to Meekneſs, to Humbleneſs, and to fear before the Lord, aſſuredly knowing that it is he that changeth Times and Things, and that bringeth down, and ſetteth up whomſoever he will; and how that thou waſt raiſed from a low Eſtate, and ſet over all thine Enemies.— And in that Day when thou waſt raiſed up, when the Fear of the Lord was before thy Face, and thy Heart was towards him, and thou waſt but little in thine own Eyes, then was it well with thee, and the Lord bleſſed thee.— And it was not once thought concerning thee, that the Hands of the Ungodly would have been ſtrengthned againſt the Righteous under thee, or that ſuch grievous and cruel Burdens and Oppreſſions would ever have been laid upon the Juſt, and acted againſt them in thy Name, and under thy Dominion, as unrighteouſly have come to paſs in theſe three Years: And this thy ſuffering of ſuch Things is thy Tranſgreſſion, and thou haſt not requited the Lord well for his Goodneſs unto thee, nor ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled his Will in ſuffering that to be done under thee, and in thy Name, which the Lord raiſed thee againſt, and to break down, hadſt thou been faithful to the End.</p>
                  <p>Again, conſider, and let it move on thy Heart, not to exalt thy ſelf, nor to be high-minded, but to fear continually, knowing that thou ſtandeſt not by thy ſelf, but by another, and that he is able to abaſe thee, and give thee into the Will of thy Enemies whenſoever he will; and how the Lord hath preſerved thee ſometimes wonderfully, and doth unto this Day, from the murderous Plots, and crafty Policy of evil Men, who ſeek thy Evil, and would rejoice in thy Fall, and in the Deſolation of thy Family and Countries: How have they, and do they lay Snares for thy Feet, that thou mayſt be cut off from amongſt Men, and die unhappily, and be accounted accurſed? And yet to this Day he hath preſerved thee, and been near to keep thee, tho' thou haſt hardly known it; and the Lord's End is Love to thee in all theſe Things, and yet a little longer to try thee, that thou mayſt give him the Glory.</p>
                  <p>O that thy Heart were opened to ſee his Hand, that thou mighteſt live unto him, and die in him in Peace. And beware leſt Hardneſs of Heart poſſeſs thee, if thou ſlight his Love, and ſo be ſhut up in Darkneſs, and given to the Deſires of thine Enemies, and leſt to the Counſels of treacherous Men, who may ſeek to exalt thee by Flattery, that they may the better caſt thee down, and deſtroy thee, and blot out thy Name in Reproach, and make thy Poſterity a People miſerable. But

now, O conſider, and let it enter thy Heart, for thou haſt not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Lord, but been wanting to him for all this, and haſt choſen thy own Way and Glory, rather than his, and not fulfilled his Counſel in raiſing thee; for the Bonds of Cruelty are not looſed by thee, and the Oppreſſed are not altogether ſet free; neither is Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion taken off from the Back of the Poor, nor the Laws regulated, nor the Liberty of pure Conſciences altogether allowed: But theſe Dominions are filled with cruel Oppreſſions, and the Poor groan every where under the heavy Hand of Injuſtice; the Needy are trodden down under Foot, and the Oppreſſed cry for Deliverance, and are ready to faint for true Juſtice and Judgment. The Proud exalt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt the Poor, and the High-minded and rebellious contemn the Meek of the Earth: The Horn of the Ungodly is exalted above the Lord's Heritage, and they that are departed from Iniquity are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Prey to Oppreſſors; and the cruel-hearted deal cruelly with the Innocent in theſe Nations.— Many are unjuſtly and wofully Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers, becauſe they cannot ſwear on this or that Occaſion, tho' in all Caſes they ſpeak the Truth, and do obey Chriſt's Commands; even ſuch are trodden upon, by unjuſt Fines charged upon them; and this is by the Corruptneſs of ſome that bear Rule under thee; who rule not for God as they ought, but turn the Sword of Juſtice.— Some ſuffer long and tedious Impriſonments, and others cruel Stripes and Abuſes, and Danger of Life many Times, from wicked Men, for reproving Sin, and crying againſt the Abominations of the Times, (which the Scriptures alſo teſtify againſt) in Streets or other Places; ſome having been ſent to Priſon, taken on the Highway, and no Evil charged againſt them; and others committed, being taken out of peaceable Meetings, and whipp'd, and ſent to Priſon, without Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of any Law, juſt or unjuſt, wholly thro' the Rage and Envy of the Devil, and ſuch who have perverted Judgment and Juſtice; and ſome in Priſons have ſuffered ſuperabundantly from the Hands of the cruel Jailors, and their Servants, by Beatings and Threatnings, and putting Irons on them, and not ſuffering any of their Friends to viſit them with Neceſſaries! and ſome have died in the Priſons, whoſe Lives were not dear to them, whoſe Blood will be reckoned on Account againſt thee one Day.— Some have ſuffered hard Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties, becauſe they could not reſpect Perſons, and bow with Hat or Knee; and from theſe Cruelties canſt thou not altogether be excuſed in the Sight of God, being brought forth in thy Name, and under thy Power. Conſider, Friend, and be awakened to true Judgment, let the Lord ſearch thy Heart, and lay theſe Things to Mind, that thou may'ſt be an Inſtrument to remove every Burthen, and may'ſt at laſt fulfil the Will of God.— O be awakened, be awakened, and ſeek the Lord's Glory, and not thine own, leſt thou periſh before the Lord and Men: Nay, if Men would give thee Honour, and high Titles, and Princely Thrones, take it not; for that which would exalt and honour thee in the World, would betray thee to the World, and caſt thee down in the Sight of the World: And this is God's Word to thee! What! ſhall the whole Nation be perjured Men, and thou the Cauſe of it? and wilt thou tranſgreſs by Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again that which thou haſt deſtroyed? Give Heed unto my Words, and underſtand my Speech; Be not exalted by Man, left Man betray thee.— Deal favourably and relieve the Oppreſſed; boaſt not thy ſelf, tho' the Lord hath uſed thee in his Hand: But know, that when he will, he can caſt thee, as a Rod, out of his Hand into the Fire; for in his Hand thou art; if thou wilt honour him, he will honour thee; otherwiſe he can, yea, and will confound thee

and break thee, and make thee weak as Water before him. His Love thro' my Heart breathes unto thee; he would thy Happineſs, if thou wilfully contemn it not by exalting thy ſelf, and ſeeking thy own Glory, and hardning thy Heart againſt the Cry of the Poor. This I was moved in Bowels of Pity to lay before thee, who am thy Friend, not in Flattery, but in an upright Heart, who wiſhes well unto thee in the Lord.</p>

Burrough <hi>mentions in the Fore-Part of this Letter of the</hi> grievous Burdens and Oppreſſions laid upon the Juſt, <hi>ſeems chiefly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Tythes which the Prieſts extorted from the</hi> Quakers, <hi>ſo that many thereby were reduced to Poverty: And the Hainouſneſs of this was was not unknown to</hi> Cromwel; <hi>for when he was about to give Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to his Enemies near</hi> Dunbar <hi>in</hi> Scotland, <hi>he ſaid in his Prayer to God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cromwel</hi> breaks his Promiſe made in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs at <hi>Dunbar</hi> in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </note> That if the Lord would be pleaſed to deliver him at that Time, he would take off that great Oppreſſion of Tythes. <hi>But this Promiſe he never perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but ſuffered himſelf to be ſwayed by the Flatteries of his Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: And therefore it was not without great Cauſe that</hi> E. Burrough <hi>laid this grievous Oppreſſion before him. A Copy of the ſaid Letter, of which but a Part is inſerted here to ſhun Prolixity, was given into the Hands of</hi> Oliver Cromwel, <hi>then Protector, in the third Month of this Year. In the next Month</hi> E. Burrough <hi>ſpoke with him about it and</hi> Cromwel <hi>told him in Effect,</hi> That all Perſecution and Cruelty was againſt his Mind; <hi>and ſaid,</hi> That he was not guilty of thoſe Perſecutions acted unjuſtly upon <hi>Burrough's</hi> Friends. <hi>This made</hi> E.

               <body>
                  <p>conſider what the Cauſe is, that what thou deſireſt not to be done is yet done: Is it not that thou mayeſt pleaſe Men? Making it appear thou art more willing to do the falſe Teachers of this Nation, and wicked Men, a Pleaſure, than to own the People of God in relieving them, and eaſing them of their cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el Burthens and Oppreſſions laid upon them by unjuſt Men. For a Word of thy Mouth, or a Shew of thy Countenance in Diſlike of theſe cruel and unjuſt Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, would bind the Hands of many blood-thirſty Men. Therefore conſider: Thou canſt not be cleared in the Sight of the Lord God from them, being acted under thee, and in thy Name: For there ſeems rather to be a Favouring of them in thee, by Forbearance of the Actors of Cruelty, by which their Hands are ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, than any Diſlike ſhewed by thee, in bearing thy Witneſs, as thou oughteſt to do, againſt them. For thou knoweſt of ſome in this City and elſe-where, whom we know to be juſt Men, who ſuffer Impriſonment and the Loſs of their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, becauſe for Conſcience Sake they cannot ſwear; and many others in thi Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſuffering cruel Things upon the like or ſame Ground, even for well-doing, and not for Evil; which Oppreſſion might be removed, and their unjuſt Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings taken off by thee, by a Word from thy Mouth or Pen; and this makes that thou canſt not be clear in the Sight of God in theſe Things; becauſe not help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thee, who haſt the Power to help it.</p>
                  <p>And as concerning the Light of Chriſt, at which thou ſtumbleſt, by which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man that cometh into the World is enlightened, in ſhort, this I ſay, This Light to thee is given of God, and thou muſt own it to be thy only Teacher to receive by it from the Father, and to be guided by it in all Things, if ever thou inheriteſt God's Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>The Kingdom of Chriſt is ſetting up by his own Power, and all muſt bow and become ſubject thereunto; he needeth none of thy Policy, nor the Strength of thy Arm to advance it: yet would he have thee not to prove thy ſelf an open Enemy thereof, by doing or ſuffering to be done, Cruelty and Injuſtice againſt them whom the Lord is redeeming out of this World, into Subjection unto that Kingdom; leſt thou be ſuch a one, as will not enter thy ſelf, nor ſuffer others to enter, and ſo Deſtruction come upon thee. Wherefore ariſe as out of Sleep, and
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:003104_0174_0FEFF490B4ABFE58"/>
ſlumber not in this World's Glory and Honour; be not overcome by the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of this World, nor the flattering Titles of Men: Wink not at the Cruelty and Oppreſſion acted by ſome, who ſhelter under thee, and make thy Name a Cloak for Miſchief againſt the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright.</p>
                  <p>Conſider, I ſay, conſider, and be thou changed in thy Mind and Heart; leſt thou having forgotten God, and his many Deliverances, be ſhut up, and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred for Deſtruction. I deſire, the Lord may give thee a more perfect <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of his Ways and Judgments, and that the Crown immortal thou may'ſt ſtrive for by Meekneſs and Righteouſneſs, thro' relieving the Oppreſſed, and ſhewing Mercy to the Poor, and removing every Burden which lies upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent; and this is the Deſire of him who is thy Friend, and would not have thee crown'd with Diſhonour, thro' ſuffering the People of God to be oppreſſed in thy Name, which will be thy Overthrow abſolutely, if thou removeſt it not by turning and eaſing the Oppreſſed.</p>

            <p>This Letter was delivered to <hi>O. Cromwel</hi> in the Fourth Month,<note place="margin">Writes again.</note> and in the Month following <hi>E.

Beſides, that ſeveral Juſtices of Peace, and other Officers in Truſt under him, when they had owned the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> had been caſt out of their Places, tho' they had not denied to ſerve him and the Common-wealth, neither had Unfaithfulneſs to their Truſt been proved againſt them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>September, E. Burrough</hi> wrote another Letter to <hi>Cromwel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">And again.</note> wherein he ſignified to him; <q>That he had many Enemies, ſome of which endeavoured to deſtroy him, by any Means, without regarding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Danger that might be in the Attempt.

That there were others, <hi>viz.</hi> the Fifth Monarchy Men, who, tho' not ſo bad as the former, yet ſecretly murmured againſt him, and envyed him, not being Friends to his Government, ſome of them being caſt out and rejected, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out juſt Cauſe, as they ſuppoſed.</q> And as to us, <hi>how can we,</hi> ſaid he <hi>mention thee in our Prayers to God, except it be to be delivered from thee, who are daily unjuſtly Sufferers by thee, or becauſe of thee?

               </note> 
               <hi>let the firſt hold his Peace.</hi> This ſpeaking cauſed a great Stir in the Congregation, and the rather becauſe he ſtood in the Place where the Women uſed to ſit: So he was apprehended by order of the Magiſtrates, and examined in the Preſence of ſome of the publick Preachers. When he was asked, <hi>What his Name was?</hi> he anſwered, <hi>that his Name according to the Fleſh was</hi> Chriſtopher Birk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:003104_0175_0FEFF4D2DB87CA60"/>
Then it was ask'd him, <hi>whether he had yet another Name?</hi> And his Anſwer was, <hi>Yes, written in the Lamb's Book of Life.</hi> Being enquired, <hi>what that Name was?</hi> he made Anſwer, <hi>None knows it but him that hath it.</hi> To which was ſaid, <hi>Why, if you have it, tell it us. No,</hi> replied he, <hi>read it, if ye have ſeen the Book of the Lamb opened: It is forbidden me to tell it.</hi> Then the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Teacher <hi>Spanke</hi> ask'd, <hi>Whether he had ſeen the Book of the Lamb opened?</hi> And he anſwered, <hi>yea.</hi> The next Queſtion was, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had opened it? No,</hi> ſaid <hi>Birkhead, it was the Lamb that did it.</hi> Then <hi>Spanke</hi> asked, <hi>Whether his Name in the Book of the Lamb, was not Jeſus? No,</hi> quoth <hi>Birkhead, that is the Name of the Lamb.</hi> More other Queſtions to enſnare him, <hi>Spanke</hi> put to him. And being examined by the Magiſtrates concerning the Place of his Abode, his Calling, or Trade, <hi>&amp;c. Spanke</hi> was asked what he had to ſay againſt him: Who then related what had happened in the Congregation. Concerning this, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Queſtions were asked of <hi>Birkhead;</hi> but ſince he underſtood not <hi>Dutch,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Tongue but imperfectly, he complain'd that he could not fully anſwer for himſelf ſo as he wiſhed. He was asked alſo, <hi>Whether any Body elſe came along with him,</hi> and he was charged <hi>to ſpeak the Truth.</hi> To which he ſaid, <hi>that God did not permit him to lye.</hi> One of the Preachers then ſaid, <hi>That all Men were Liars.</hi> To this, <hi>Birk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> replied, <hi>that tho' all Man were Liars, yet he knew a Deliverance from Lying.</hi> Then <hi>Spanke</hi> bid him, <hi>not to add to the Scriptures.</hi> For <hi>Birkhead</hi> had accuſed him a little before, <hi>that he had added his Meaning to the Scriptures.</hi> And it being ſtrongly aſſerted that all Men were Liars, <hi>Birkhead</hi> took Occaſion from thence, to ask <hi>Spanke, Whether he was a Liar?</hi> who without any Heſitation anſwering, <hi>Yes, Birkhead</hi> bluntly told him, <hi>Then thou art of thy Father the Devil.</hi> Now the Matter of <hi>J. Naylor</hi> having cauſed ſtrange Reports of the <hi>Quakers</hi> every where, and <hi>Birk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> for Want of the Language not being able to anſwer ſo plainly every Objection, his Offence without Queſtion was aggravated the more; and the Concluſion was, that he was ſentenced to be confined in the Houſe of Correction. But after ſome Time,<note place="margin">Is ſent to the Houſe of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, but after releas'd. <hi>G.

            <p>In this Year it was, I think, that one <hi>George Baily</hi> coming into <hi>France,</hi> was taken into Cuſtody, and dyed in Priſon there; he having zealouſly teſtified againſt Popery, and ſpoken boldly againſt the Worſhipping of Images.</p>

But they being perſwaded of their own Innocency, did not obey this Command.

               <hi>There was now an evident Sign, that he was a good Chriſtian, for he was come thro' Perſecution and Sufferings; and thoſe Things which had been ſpoken in his Prejudice, were manifeſt to be untrue. Robinſon</hi> told the Friar, <hi>It was he and his Brethren that had been the Cauſe of his Sufferings, and withſtood his coming to</hi> Jeruſalem. To which the other returned, <hi>That the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Friar had miſinformed them by his Writing, which had cauſed them to do what they had done; and that therefore they deſired he would now paſs by thoſe Things, ſeeing he was come thro' in ſuch a miraculous Manner; for</hi> (continu'd the Friar) <hi>it was the Lord's Work, thus to carry him thro', and he might praiſe God he was preſerved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Morning there came a Friar to him, and asked, <hi>If he would become an obedient Child, and go to viſit the holy Places, according to their Cuſtom?</hi> He anſwered, <hi>No.</hi> Then the Friar ſaid, <hi>Whereas others give great Sums of Money to ſee them, you ſhall ſee them for Nothing.</hi> But <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binſon</hi> replyed, <hi>I ſhall not viſit them in your Manner, for in ſo Doing I ſhould ſin againſt God.</hi> This did not pleaſe the Friar, yet he ſaid, <hi>They would honour him as much as ever they did any</hi> Engliſh-Man <hi>that came thither, if he would conform unto them.</hi> But <hi>Robinſon</hi> continued immoveable, and ſaid, <hi>He ſhould not conform; and as to their Honour, he did not matter it.</hi> Then the Friar became angry, and ſaid, <hi>They would make him an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

to all</hi> Engliſhmen <hi>that came thither.</hi> To which <hi>Robinſon,</hi> returned, <hi>I chuſe rather your Diſhonour than your Honour.</hi> The Friar ſeeing he could not prevail, went away in Anger, and within a ſhort Time came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and other Friars being preſent, one asked him, <hi>If he would viſit their Church, and the holy Sepulchre, and</hi> Bethlehem, <hi>with the reſt of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Places, as other Pilgrims did?</hi> But he told them, <hi>At preſent he had no Buſineſs to viſit them; and in their Manner he ſhould not viſit them at all,</hi> viz. <hi>to worſhip them.</hi> Then one ſaid to him, <hi>How can you be a Servant of God, and will not go to viſit the Places where the holy Men of God dwelt?</hi> To which he returned, <hi>That they, under Pretence of doing Service to God, in viſiting the Places where the holy Men dwelt, did oppoſe that Way, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt that Life, which the holy Men of God lived and walked in.</hi> Then one of the Friars ſaid, <hi>What do you preach unto us for?</hi> To which he repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>That he would have them turn from thoſe evil Practices they lived in, elſe the Wrath of the Almighty would be kindled againſt them.</hi> But they did not at all like ſuch Diſcourſe, and therefore ſaid, <hi>If he would not go and viſit the aforeſaid Places, yet he muſt give twenty five Dollars, as was the Manner of thoſe that viſited them; for,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>the</hi> Turks <hi>muſt be paid, whether he would viſit them, or not; but if he would viſit them, then they would pay it for him.</hi> To this he ſignified, that he could not ſubmit to ſuch unreaſonable Terms. Then they brought him before a <hi>Turk</hi> in Authority in that Place, who asked him divers Queſtions, to which he ſoberly gave Anſwers; and they diſcourſing about the Worſhip of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> the <hi>Turk</hi> asked alſo, <hi>What was the Ground of his coming to</hi> Jeruſalem? To which he anſwered, <hi>That it was by the Command of the Lord God of Heaven and Earth he came thither; and that the great and tender Love of God was made manifeſt in viſiting them; his compaſſionate Mercies being ſuch, that he would gather them in this the Day of his gathering.</hi> This was the Meſſage which <hi>Robinſon</hi> believed he had from the Lord to declare unto them, whether they would hear, or forbear. And afterwards he wrote, that having thus cleared his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, he found great Peace with the Lord, and therefore he mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified his glorious Name, who had gone along with him, and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him in many Trials. For the Friars, who intended him Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, were commanded by the <hi>Turks</hi> to carry him again ſafe and free of Charges, to <hi>Ramla.</hi> Here I leave him, becauſe I don't find how he came home; but that he returned thither in Safety, appears to me from the Relation he afterwards publiſhed of his Travels.</p>

And as for the <hi>Romans</hi> who ſpake <hi>Latin,</hi> they perſecuted the Chriſtians; and <hi>Pilate,</hi> one of the <hi>Roman</hi> Governors, ſet <hi>Hebrew, Greek,</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> a-top of Chriſt when he crucified him. Thus the Languages, which began at <hi>Babel,</hi> had been ſet above Chriſt, the Word: And <hi>John</hi> the Divine, who preached the Word, that was in the Beginning, ſaid, that the Beaſt and the Whore had Power over Tongues and Languages, and they were as Waters, and in the Myſtery <hi>Babylon,</hi> for they began at <hi>Babel;</hi> and the Perſecutors of Chriſt ſet them over him, when he was crucified by them.</q> 
               <hi>Doſt thou think,</hi> ſaid <hi>G.

Queſtion, <hi>Whether the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>as it now ſtood, was not degenerated from the true Church which was in the primitive Times, from the Life and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi>

                  <hi>G. F.</hi> with two others meet him there.</note> 
               <hi>and from the Power and Spirit that thoſe Believers were in?</hi> They ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſtated the Queſtion accordingly, the Jeſuit affirmed, <hi>That the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>now was in the Virginity and Purity of the Primitive Church.</hi> By this Time, <hi>G. Fox</hi> being come in, the Jeſuit was asked, <hi>Whether they had the Holy Ghoſt poured out upon them, as the Apoſtles had?</hi> And he ſaid, <hi>No.</hi> Then ſaid <hi>G. Fox, If ye have not the ſame Holy Ghoſt poured forth upon you, and the ſame Power and Spirit, that the Apoſtles had, then ye are degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the Power and Spirit, which the Primitive Church was in.</hi> And he asked the Jeſuit, <hi>What Scripture they had for ſetting up Cloiſters for Nuns, Abbies and Monaſteries for Men, and for their praying by Beads, and to Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and for making Croſſes, for forbidding of Meats and Marriages, and for putting People to Death for Religion?</hi> If, ſaid he, <hi>ye are in the Practice of the Primitive Church, in its Purity and Virginity, then let us ſee by Scripture where-ever they practiſed ſuch Things?</hi> For it was agreed mutually, that both the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> and the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſhould make good by Scripture what they ſaid. Then the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> ſaid, there was a <hi>written,</hi> and an <hi>unwritten Word.</hi> Which made <hi>G. Fox</hi> ask, <hi>What he called his unwritten Word?</hi> And he anſwer'd, <hi>The written Word is the Scriptures, and the unwritten Word is that which the Apoſtles ſpake by Word of Mouth, which are all thoſe Traditions that we practiſe.</hi> Then <hi>G. Fox</hi> bid him <hi>prove that by Scripture;</hi> and the Jeſuit alledged the Words of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Theſſ. ii.</hi> 5. <hi>When I was with you, I told you theſe Things: That is,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I told you of Nunneries and Monaſteries, of putting to Death for Religion, and of Praying by Beads and to Images,</hi> &amp;c. This he affirmed to be the <hi>unwritten Word</hi> of the Apoſtles, <hi>which they told then, and had ſince been continued by Tradition unto theſe Times.</hi> Then <hi>G. Fox</hi> deſired him <hi>to read that Scripture again, that he might ſee how he had perverted the Apoſtle's Words, ſince that which the Apoſtle ſaid there he had told them before, was not an unwritten Word, but was written down there;</hi> namely, <hi>that the Man of Sin, the Son of Perdition, ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed before that great and terrible Day of Chriſt, which he was writing of, ſhould come. And therefore this was not telling them any of thoſe things the</hi> Church of Rome <hi>practiſed. Beſides, the Apoſtle, in the third Chapter of the ſaid</hi> Epiſtle, <hi>told the Church of ſome diſorderly Perſons he heard were amongſt them, Buſy-bodies, who did not work at all; concerning whom he had command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them</hi> by his unwritten Word, <hi>when he was among them, that if any would not work, neither ſhould be eat; which now he commanded them again in his</hi> written Words in this Epiſtle, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> iii.</p>
            <p>The Jeſuit now finding no other Scriptural Proof for the Tradition of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> let that Point fall, and came to the Sacrament of the Altar; to prove the Reality of which, he began with the <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Lamb,</hi> and the <hi>Shew Bread,</hi> and ſo came to the Words of Chriſt, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> and to what the Apoſtle writ to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from thence, <hi>that after the Prieſt had conſecrated the Bread and Wine, it was immortal and divine, and that he who received it, received the whole Chriſt.</hi> To this <hi>G. Fox</hi> ſaid, <hi>that the ſame Apoſtle told the</hi> Corinthians, <hi>after they had taken Bread and Wine in Remembrance of Chriſt's Death,</hi> that they were Reprobates if Chriſt was not in them. <hi>But that if the Bread they eat was Chriſt, he muſt of Neceſſity have been in them, after they had eaten it. Beſides, if the Bread and Wine which the</hi> Corinthians <hi>ate and drunk, was Chriſt's Body, how then</hi> (continued he) <hi>hath Chriſt a Body in Heaven?</hi> And he alſo ſignified to him, <hi>that both the Diſciples at the Supper, and the</hi> Corinthians <hi>afterwards, were to eat the Bread and drink the Wine</hi> in Remembrance of Chriſt, <hi>and</hi> to ſhew forth his Death till he came; <hi>which plainly prov'd, that the Bread and Wine which they took, was not his Body. For if it had been his real Body that they ate,</hi> then he had been
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:003104_0186_0FEFF49E7A480B40"/>
come, and was then <hi>there preſent; and it would have been improper to have done ſuch a thing in Remembrance of him, if he had been then preſent with them; as he muſt have been, if that Bread and Wine, which they eat and drank, had been his real Body.</hi> And as to the Words of Chriſt; <hi>This is my Body,</hi> G. Fox told him, <hi>Chriſt calls himſelf a</hi> Vine, <hi>and a</hi> Door, <hi>and is called in Scripture, a</hi> Rock: <hi>Is Chriſt therefore an outward Rock, Door, or Vine? O,</hi> ſaid the Jeſuit, <hi>Theſe Words are to be interpreted. So,</hi> ſaid G. Fox, <hi>are thoſe Words of Chriſt, This is my Body.</hi> And having thus ſtopt the Jeſuit's Mouth, he made this Propoſal; <hi>That ſeeing he ſaid the Bread and Wine was immortal and divine, and the very Chriſt, and that whoſoever received it, received the whole Chriſt; a Meeting might be appointed between ſome ſuch</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts <hi>as the</hi> Pope <hi>and his</hi> Cardinals <hi>ſhould appoint, and ſome of thoſe called</hi> Quakers: <hi>And then,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>let a Bottle of Wine, and a Loaf of Bread he brought, and divided each into two Parts, and let them conſecrate which of thoſe Parts they will; and then let the conſecrated and unconſecrated Bread and Wine be ſet in a ſafe Place, with a ſure Watch upon it; and let Trial then be made, whether the conſecrated Bread and Wine will not loſe its Goodneſs,</hi> viz. <hi>the Bread grow dry and mouldy, and the Wine turn dead and ſoure, as well and as ſoon as that which was unconſecrated; for by this Means the Truth of this Matter may be made manifeſt. And if the conſecrated Bread and Wine change not, but retain their Savour and Goodneſs, this may be a Means to draw many to your Church. But if they change, decay, and loſe their Goodneſs, then ought you to confeſs and forſake your Error, and ſhed no more Blood about it, as hath been done, eſpecially in Queen</hi> Mary's <hi>Days.</hi> To this, the Jeſuit made this Reply; <hi>Take a Piece of new Cloth, and cut it into two Pieces, and make two Garments of it, and put one of them upon King</hi> David's <hi>Back, and the other upon a Beggar's, and the one Garment ſhall wear away as well as the other. Is this,</hi> ſaid G. Fox, <hi>thy Anſwer? Yes,</hi> ſaid the Jeſuit. <hi>Then,</hi> ſaid G. Fox, <hi>By this the Company may all be ſatisfied, that your conſecrated Bread and Wine is not Chriſt. Doſt thou now ſay that the conſecrated Bread and Wine, which you have told People was immortal and divine, and the real Body and Blood of Chriſt, will wear away, or decay as well as the other? Then I muſt tell thee, Chriſt remains the ſame to Day as Yeſterday, and never decays; but is the Saints Heavenly Food in all Generations, thro' which they have Life.</hi> To this the Jeſuit reply'd no more, but let the Thing fall; for he perceived that thoſe which were preſent, ſaw his Error, and that he could not defend it. Then <hi>G. Fox</hi> asked him, <hi>why the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>did perſecute, and put People to Death for Religion?</hi> And he anſwered, <hi>It was not the Church did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> but the Magiſtrates. G. Fox</hi> asked, <hi>whether thoſe Magiſtrates were not counted and called Believers and Chriſtians? Yes,</hi> ſaid he. <hi>Are they not Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of your Church?</hi> asked <hi>G. Fox. Yes,</hi> ſaid the Jeſuit. Then <hi>G. Fox</hi> left it to the People to judge, <hi>whether the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>did not perſecute, and put People to Death for Religion.</hi> And thus they parted; the Jeſuit's Subtilty being comprehended by the Simplicity of <hi>G.

               <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s moſt beloved Daughter, being ſick, and much troubled in Mind, ſo that none that came could admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter any Comfort to her, <hi>G. Fox</hi> viſited her with the following Letter.</p>

                  <p>BE, ſtill and cool in thy own Mind and Spirit from thy own Thoughts, and then thou wilt feel the Principle of God, to turn thy Mind to the Lord God, from whom Life comes; whereby thou may'ſt receive his Strength and Power to allay all bluſtering Storms and Tempeſts. That is it which works up into Patience, into Innocency, into Soberneſs, into Stilneſs, into Stayedneſs, into Quietneſs, up to God with his Power. Therefore mind, that is the Word of the Lord unto thee, that the Authority of God thou may'ſt feel and thy Faith in that, to work down that which troubles thee: For that is it which keeps Peace, and brings up the Witneſs in thee, which hath been tranſgreſſed, to feel after God with his Power and Life, who is a God of Order and Peace. When thou art in the Tranſgreſſion of the Life of God in thy own particular, the Mind flies up in the Air, and the Creature is led into the Night, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture goes out of its Courſe, and an old Garment goes on, and an uppermoſt Clothing, and thy Nature being led out of its Courſe, it comes to be all on a Fire, in the Tranſgreſſion; and that defaceth the Glory of the firſt Body. Therefore be ſtill a while from thy own Thoughts, ſearching, ſeeking, Deſires, and Imaginations, and be ſtayed in the Principle of God in thee, that it may raiſe thy Mind up to God, and ſtay it upon God, and thou wilt find Strength from him, and find him to be a God at hand, a preſent Help in the Time of Trouble, and of Need. And thou being come to the Principle of God, which hath been tranſgreſſed, it will keep thee humble; and the Humble God will teach his Way, which is Peace, and ſuch he doth exalt. Now as the Principle of God in thee hath been tranſgreſſed, come to it, that it may keep thy Mind down
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:003104_0188_0FEFF4A148AFA9D0"/>
low to the Lord God; and deny thy ſelf, and from thy own Will, that is the earthly, thou muſt be kept: Then thou wilt feel the Power of God, which will bring Nature into its Courſe, and give thee to ſee the Glory of the firſt Body. And there the Wiſdom of God will be received (which is Chriſt, by which all Things were made and created) to be thereby preſerved and ordered to God's Glory. There thou wilt come to receive and feel the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician of Value, who clothes People in their right Mind; whereby they may ſerve God, and do his Will. For all Diſtractions, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulineſs, and Confuſion is in the Tranſgreſſion; which Tranſgreſſion muſt be brought down, before the Principle of God, which hath been tranſgreſſed againſt, be lifted up; whereby the Mind may be ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſtilled, and a right Underſtanding of the Lord may be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; whereby his Bleſſings enter, and are felt, over all that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, in the Power of the Lord God, which raiſeth up the Principle of God within, and gives a Feeling after God, and in Time gives Dominion. Therefore keep in the Fear of the Lord God; that is the Word of the Lord God unto thee; for all theſe Things happen to thee for thy Good, and for the Good of thoſe concerned for thee, to make you know your ſelves, and your own Weakneſs, and that ye may know the Lord's Strength and Power, and may truſt in him. Therefore let the Time that is paſt be ſufficient to every one, who in any Thing hath been lifted up in Tranſgreſſion, out of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Lord: For he can bring down, and abaſe the mighty, and lay them in the Duſt of the Earth. Therefore all keep low in his Fear, that thereby ye may receive the Secrets of God and his Wiſdom, and may know the Shadow of the Almighty, and ſit under it in all Tempeſts, Storms, and Heats. For God is a God at Hand, and the Moſt-High rules in the Children of Men. So then this is the Word of the Lord God unto you all, what the Light doth make manifeſt and diſcover, as Temptations, Diſtractions, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions; do not look at the Temptation, Confuſions, Corruptions, but at the Light which diſcovers them, and makes them manifeſt. And with the ſame Light you may feel over them, to receive Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ſtand againſt them. The ſame Light which lets you ſee Sin and Tranſgreſſion, will let you ſee the Covenant of God, which blots out your Sin and Tranſgreſſion, which gives Victory and Dominion over it, and brings into Covenant with God. For looking down at Sin, and Corruption and Diſtraction, ye are ſwallowed up in it: But looking at the Light which diſcovers them, ye will ſee over them: That will give Victory, and ye will find Grace and Strength; and there is the firſt Step to Peace. That will bring Salvation, and by it ye may ſee to the Beginning, and the <hi>Glory that was with the Father before the World began;</hi> and ſo come to know the Seed of God, which is the Heir of the Promiſe of God, and of the World which hath no End, and which bruiſes the Head of the Serpent, who ſtops People from coming to God. That ye may feel the Power of an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Life, the Power of God which is immortal, which brings the immortal Soul up to the immortal God, in whom it doth rejoice.

                        <head>To the Heads and Governors of this Nation, who have put forth a <hi>Declaration</hi> for the keeping of a Day of Solemn <hi>Faſting</hi> and <hi>Humiliation,</hi> for the Perſecution <hi>(as you ſay)</hi> of divers Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple beyond the Seas, profeſſing the reformed Religion, which, <hi>ye ſay,</hi> hath been tranſmitted unto them from their Anceſtors.</head>
                        <p>A Profeſſion of the reformed Religion may be tranſmitted to Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and ſo holden by Tradition; and in that, wherein the Profeſſion and Tradition is holden, is the Day of Humiliation kept; which ſtands in the Will of Man, which is not the Faſt that the Lord requires, <hi>to bow down the Head like a Bulruſh for a Day,</hi> and the Day following be in the ſame Condition as they were the Day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. To the Light of Chriſt Jeſus in your Conſciences do I ſpeak, which teſtifieth for God every Day, and witneſſeth againſt all Sin and Perſecution; which Meaſure of God, if ye be guided by it, doth not limit God to a Day, but leads to the Faſt which the Lord requires, which is, <hi>To looſe the Bonds of Wickedneſs, to undo the heavy Burdens, to break every Yoke, and to let the Oppreſſed go free,</hi> Iſa. lviii. 6, 7. This is the Faſt the Lord requires; and this ſtands not in the Tranſmiſſion of Times, nor in the Traditions of Men: But this ſtands in that which was before Times were, and which leads out of Time, and ſhall be, when Time ſhall be no more. And theſe that teach for Doctrine the Commandments of Men, are they that ever perſecuted the Life and Power when it came. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ye mention a Decree or Edict, that was made againſt the ſaid perſecuted Proteſtants; all ſuch Decrees or Edicts proceed from the Ground of the Pope's Religion and Supremacy, and therein ſtands his Tyranny and Cruelty, acted in that Will, which is in that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which exerciſeth Lordſhip over one another, (as you may read, <hi>Mark</hi> x. 42. <hi>Luke</hi> xxii. 25.) as all the Heathen do, and ever did; and in the Heatheniſh Nature is all the Tyranny and Perſecution ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, by them that are out of the Obedience to the Light of Chriſt Jeſus in the Conſcience, which is the Guider and Leader of all who are tender of that of God in the Conſcience. But who are not led by this, know not what it is to ſuffer for Conſcience ſake. Now, whereas ye take into your Conſideration the ſad Perſecution, Tyranny, and Cruelty exerciſed upon them, whom ye call your Proteſtant Brethren, and do contribute and adminiſter to their Wants outwardly; this is good in its Place, and we own it, and ſee it good to adminiſter to the Neceſſities of others, and to do good to all: And we who are Sufferers by a Law derived from the Pope, are willing to join, and to contribute with you to their outward <hi>Neceſſities. For the Earth is the Lord's, and the Fulneſs thereof;</hi> who is good to all and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to all, and willing that all ſhould be ſaved, and come to the Knowledge of the Truth. But in the mean Time, while ye are doing this, and taking Notice of others Cruelty, Tyranny, and Perſecution, turn your Eye upon your ſelves, and ſee what ye are doing at home. To the Light of Chriſt Jeſus in all your Conſciences I ſpeak, which cannot lie, nor cannot err, nor cannot bear falſe witneſs; but doth bear Witneſs for God, and cries for Equity, and Juſtice, and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs

to be executed. See what ye are doing who profeſs the Scriptures which were given forth by the Saints in Light, who dwelt in the Light and in the Life of them. For them who do now witneſs the ſame Light, the ſame Life, and the ſame Power which gave forth the Scriptures, which ye in Words profeſs, them ye perſecute, them ye hale out of your Synagogues and Markets; them ye beat, ſtock, and impriſon. Now let that of God in your Conſciences, which is juſt and righteous, and equal, examine and try, whether ye have any Example or Precedent to exerciſe this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, which now many in this Nation ſuffer under, who are a People harmleſs and innocent, walking in Obedience towards God and Man: And tho' ye account the Way of Truth they walk in, Hereſy; yet therein do they exerciſe themſelves to have always a <hi>Conſcience void of Offence towards God and Man,</hi> as ye may read the Saints of old did, <hi>Acts</hi> xxiv. 14, 15, 16. not wronging any Man, neither giving any juſt Cauſe of Offence; only being obedient to the Commands of the Lord, to declare, as they are moved by the Holy Ghoſt; and ſtanding for the Teſtimony of a good Conſcience, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Truth in Chriſt, their Conſciences bearing them witneſs that they lie not: For this do they ſuffer under you, who in Words profeſs the ſame Thing for which they ſuffer. Now ſee if any Age or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration did ever perſecute as ye do: For ye profeſs Chriſt Jeſus who reveals the Father, and perſecute them that witneſs the Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Father by Chriſt Jeſus unto them. Ye profeſs Chriſt Jeſus, who is the Light of the World, <hi>that enlightens every one that cometh into the World,</hi> and yet perſecute them that bear witneſs and give Teſtimony to this Light. Ye profeſs that the Word is become Fleſh, and yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute them that witneſs it ſo. Ye profeſs that whoſoever confeſſeth not that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the Fleſh, is an Antichriſt, and yet perſecute them that do confeſs him come in the Fleſh, and call them Antichriſts and Deceivers. Ye profeſs that the Kingdom of Chriſt is come, and yet perſecute them that witneſs it come. Ye profeſs Chriſt Jeſus the Reſurrection and the Life, and yet perſecute them that wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs him to be ſo. If ye ſay, <hi>How ſhall we know that theſe People who ſay they witneſs theſe Things, do ſo, or no?</hi> I anſwer, Turn your Minds to the Light which Chriſt Jeſus hath enlightned you withal, which is one in all; and if ye walk in the Light, ye ſhall have the Light of Life, and then ye will know and ſee what ye have done, who have perſecuted the Lord of Glory (in his People) in whom is Life, and the Life is the Light of Men. To no other Touchſtone ſhall we turn you, but into your own Conſciences, and there ſhall ye find the Truth of what we have declared unto you, and of what we bear Teſtimony to, according to the Holy Scriptures. And when the Books of Conſciences are opened, and all judged out of them, then ſhall ye witneſs us to be of God, and our Teſtimony to be true; tho' now ye may ſtop your Ears, and harden your Hearts, while it is called to Day: But then ye ſhall know what ye have done, and whom ye have tranſgreſſed againſt; and then ye will ſee that no Perſecutors in any Age or Generation that ever went before you, did ever tranſgreſs againſt that Light and Meaſure of God made manifeſt, in ſuch Manner as ye have done. For tho' Chriſt and the Apoſtles were perſecuted in their Times, the <hi>Jews,</hi> for the moſt Part of them, did not know that he was the Chriſt, when he came, notwithſtanding that they had the Scriptures, which prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied of him; neither did they believe that he was riſen again, when the Apoſtles preached his Reſurrection. But ye ſay, <hi>Ye believe he is come;</hi> and ye ſay, <hi>Ye believe his Reſurrection,</hi> and yet ye perſecute
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:003104_0191_0FEFF4E7441F86D8"/>
thoſe that witneſs him come in the Fleſh, thoſe that are buried with him in Baptiſm, thoſe that are conformable to his Death, and know the Power of his Reſurrection, thoſe ye perſecute, thoſe ye hale before Magiſtrates, and ſuffer to be beaten in your Synagogues; thoſe ye cauſe to be whipp'd and ſtock'd, and ſhamefully entreated, and into Priſon caſt, and kept, as many Jails in this Nation at this Day teſtify to your Faces. Therefore honeſtly conſider what ye are doing, while ye are taking Notice of others Cruelties, leſt ye over-look your own. There is ſome Difference in many Things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Popiſh Religion, and that which ye call the Proteſtant; but in this Perſecution of yours there is no Difference: For ye will confeſs, that the Foundation of your Religion is grounded upon the Scriptures; and yet now ye are perſecuting them that be in the ſame Life which they were in who ſpake forth the Scriptures; your ſelves being the mean while under a Profeſſion of the Words they ſpake; and this ye ſhall one Day witneſs. So ye have a Profeſſion and Form, and perſecute them that are in the Poſſeſſion, Life, and Power. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore know aſſuredly, that ye muſt come to Judgment; for he is made manifeſt to whom all Judgment is committed. Therefore to the Light of Chriſt Jeſus in your Conſciences, which ſearcheth and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth you, turn your Minds, and ſtand ſtill, and wait there to receive the righteous Law, which is according to that of God in the Conſcience which is now riſing, and is bearing witneſs againſt all Ungodlineſs and Unrighteouſneſs of Men; and they whom ye perſecute, are manifeſt to God, and that of God in all Conſciences ſhall bear Witneſs for us, that we are of God: And this ye ſhall one Day witneſs, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye will hear, or forbear. Our Rejoicing is in the Teſtimony of our Conſciences, that in Simplicity, and godly Sincerity, (not with fleſhly Wiſdom, but by the Grace of God) we have had our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in the World, not handling the Word of God deceitfully, but in the Manifeſtation of the Truth; commending our ſelves to every Man's Conſcience in the Sight of God: And if our Goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt: And for the witneſſing the holding the Myſtery of Faith in a pure Conſcience, do we ſuffer, and are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for Conſcience-Sake. This is thank-worthy, if a Man for Conſcience-ſake endure Griefs and ſuffering wrongfully. And in this is our Joy and Rejoicing, having a good Conſcience, that whereas we are evil ſpoken of, as Evil-doers, they may be aſhamed, that falſely accuſe our good Converſation in Chriſt; which is not only the putting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of the Filth of the Fleſh, but the Anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God, by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt. And this we wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs made manifeſt, (eternal Praiſes to the living God) and bear Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony to that which ſpake it in the Apoſtle in Life and Power. And therefore do we bear witneſs, and teſtify againſt thoſe, who being got into a Form and Profeſſion of it, do perſecute the Life and Power. Therefore to the eternal Light of Chriſt Jeſus, the Searcher and Trier of all Hearts, turn your Minds, and ſee what ye are doing, leſt ye overturn your Foundation and Bottom whereon ye pretend to ſtand, while ye are profeſſing the Scriptures, and perſecuting the Life, Light, and Power which they were in who gave them forth. For the Stone cut out of the Mountain without Hands, is now ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king at the Feet of the Image, the Profeſſion which is ſet up, and ſtands in the Will of Man. Now is that made manifeſt unto which all muſt anſwer, and appear before the Judgment-Seat of Chriſt; that every one may receive the Thing done in his Body, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that he hath done, whether it be good, or bad. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore the Terror of the Lord, we perſwade Men; but we
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:003104_0192_0FEFF4A616492F58"/>
are made manifeſt unto God, and ſhall be made manifeſt in all your Conſciences, which ye ſhall witneſs.</p>

And this am I moved to give forth, and ſend to thee, that thou may'ſt be ſatisfied, and all Things tried and made manifeſt in the Sight of all Men, and that all raſh Judgment, and falſe Suppoſition, which lodgeth in the Hearts of many, may be confounded and brought to nought; and let it be left off to cry out <hi>Deceivers,</hi> and <hi>Hereſy,</hi> &amp;c. and cauſing any to ſuffer on Suſpicion thereupon, but bring all Things to Light, and true Judgment, that what is proved to be the Truth, may be own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and not perſecuted any more; for we are willing to be made manifeſt to all Men; and if any Thing be objected againſt us, which may not be ſufficiently anſwered and reſolved to ſober Men, then our Enemies are more free, and have whereof to glory in againſt us: But and if all Occaſion of Stumbling be removed by Anſwers according to the Scriptures, and our Principles, Practices, and Doctrines thereby vindicated, then let all the Teachers, and all our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries ſhut their Mouths from biting at us, and railing againſt us, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing of us to thee; and let thy Ear be ſhut from believing Lies againſt the innocent; and let none ſuffer in thy Dominion under the Cruelty of Men, upon ſuch a Ground. Hereof I ſhall be glad to receive an Anſwer, and to join Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue in this Cauſe; and in this mean Time, and always, am a Lover of thy Soul, but a Witneſs againſt all Oppreſſion.</p>

                     </note> that by the Lord you were raiſed from a low State, and when he will, he can abaſe you, and bring you down; he gave you the Palace of Princes, and threw out them before you.</p>
                  <p>O! remember this, every one of you, and come to the Witneſs of God in you, and be humble, and meek, and lowly, and let the Lord's Fear be in your Hearts, and be of a tender Spirit, having your Minds exerciſed in Purity, in Holineſs, and in Righteouſneſs; and exalt not your ſelves, nor be lifted up in your Hearts, in the Pride and Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glories, and Honours of this World, leſt the Lord caſt you down, and make your Name and Poſterity a Reproach, as he hath done many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you; and if you walk in the ſame Steps, and do the ſame Things, and become guilty of the ſame Abominations, and ſuffer the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Servants of the Lord to be perſecuted (as many are at this Day, ſome until Death) ſhall the Lord ſpare you?

                  <p>Wherefore humble your ſelves under the Hand of God, and ſearch your own Hearts, and caſt out the Abominations that vex the Spirit of the Lord; and ſuffer not the People of the Lord's precious Flock to be devour'd, and made a Prey to the Wicked; for becauſe of this, the Rod of Affliction cometh upon you, and may ſuddenly break you to Pieces: But mind the Seed of God, in you, which is oppreſſed, and wait to know the Power of the Lord, which will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem you out of Sin and Death, and reconcile you to God, and bring you into Fellowſhip with himſelf, to enjoy Peace and Reſt for your Souls, that you may be made Heirs of the Inheritance of an endleſs Life; and this would make you truly honourable, and will be more Satisfaction to you, and Joy, and Content, and true Rejoicing, than all worldly Crowns and Worldly Glories, which will waſte and conſume away, and leave you miſerable: And remember that you are now warned from the Lord God, by whom I am moved to write this unto you, in dear and tender Love to you all; and one Day you ſhall witneſs it.</p>
                  <p>And as concerning the <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſo called, who are accounted as vile in the Sight of Men, and are caſt out of all Power and Place in the Nation, being deſpiſed of all, and alſo are reproached, perſecuted, and impriſoned, and all Manner of Evil and Injuſtice unrighteouſly done, and ſpoken againſt them, by wicked and corrupt Men in Authority; yet are they the Children and Servants of the living God, and greatly beloved of him, and are as dear to him as the Apple of his Eye, and his Power and Preſence is with them; and the Time is at Hand, that the Lord will make their Perſecutors fall, and their Enemies bow and tremble, tho' now they ſuffer unjuſtly, and are trodden down, as not deſerving a Place on the Earth; yet it is for Righteouſneſs-ſake, and becauſe they ſhew forth the Image of the Father, and not for Evil-doing: And will not their Sufferings lie upon you? For many Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds have ſuffered cruel, and great Things, and ſome the Loſs of Life (tho' not by, yet in the Name of the Protector;) and about an Hundred at this preſent Day lie in Holes, and Dungeons, and Priſons, up and down the Nation; and ſome at this Time are ſick nigh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

How the Bodies of ſome have been tortur'd by Stocks, and cruel Whippings! and how ſome lie ſick in ſtinking Holes and Dungeons on the Ground, or a little Straw at beſt; Ten, or often more, in a Priſon together, and ſometimes their own Friends not ſuffer'd to come to viſit them with Neceſſaries! Oh, did but your Eyes behold, or your Hearts perceive the Greatneſs of the Cruelty, which ſome of the Lord's dear Servants, and your faithful Friends undergo, it would make your Hearts ake, and your Spirits to tremble! And all this is done in the Name, and under the Authority of (Protector;) therefore how ſhould the Lord but lay it to your Charge, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict him and his Family? <hi>He will make you know there is a God that can do whatſoever he will, and that Life and Death are in his Hands, and all Creatures are as Clay in the Hands of the Potter; and he rules in the Kingdoms of Men, and putteth down one, and ſetteth up another, according to his Pleaſure:</hi> But if the Love of God be withholden from you, it is becauſe of Diſobedience to him, and your Tranſgreſſion. Wherefore be obedient to him, and love his Ways and Judgments, that he may make you more happy with a Crown immortal, that never fades away. And remember once more the Lord hath war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned you, by a Friend unto you in the Lord.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>As for Magiſtracy, it was ordained of God to be a Dread, and Terror, and Limit to Evil-doers, and to be a Defence and Praiſe to all that do well; to condemn the guilty, and to juſtify the guiltleſs; but the Exerciſe thereof at this Day in theſe Nations is degenerated, and ſome that are in Authority are greatly corrupted, and regard not the juſt and pure Law of God, to judge only thereby; but oppreſs the Poor by Injuſtice, and ſubvert the good Laws of God and Men to a wrong End and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe, abuſing Authority, and turning the Sword againſt the Juſt, whereby true Judgment is turned backward, and the Innocent made unjuſtly to ſuffer for Righteouſneſs-ſake, thro' the Corruption of Men in Authority; and didſt thou but know what we know in this Particular, it would pierce thy Heart: Why? It is frequent among ſome of the Judges and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,</hi> to commit a Man to Priſon, and impoſe ſome great Fine upon him, and to caſt him into a Dungeon, or Hole, among Thieves and Murderers, for a long Seaſon, for no other Offence, or Breach of any Law, but becauſe he cannot put off his Hat to them, and reſpect their Perſons, by the Hat, or bowing the Knee: <hi>And many others that fear God, and for Conſcience-ſake cannot ſwear upon a Book by kiſſing it, and laying Hand upon it, becauſe Chriſt ſaith,</hi> Swear not at all; <hi>tho' they deny not to ſpeak and do the Truth in all Things, as in the Preſence of God and all Men: And many others, that becauſe they are moved to cry againſt Sin, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare againſt the Iniquities of the Times in Teachers, Rulers and People, that highly abound, perhaps in a Market, or Steeple-houſe, or Highway, or other Places, as they are moved of God: And many others, becauſe for Conſcience-ſake they cannot pay Tythes, nor give Money and Wages to maintain a Prieſt, or falſe Teacher, that they receive no Profit by: or to maintain a Steeple-houſe, where the World worſhips in vain Traditions, and not in the Spirit and Power of God. And many have been taken out of peaceable Meetings, where they were waiting upon the Lord; and ſome out of their Inns and Friend's Houſes; and many have been taken on the Way, travelling about their lawful Occaſions; and ſome from their Callings and Labours; and for theſe Cauſes, thro' the Envy of wicked Men, and without any juſt Conviction of the Breach of any Law, or any lawful Trial or Examination, have Hundreds of juſt Men, being wholly innocent, been ſent to Priſon, and lain many Months, and ſome for Years, or whipt, or put in the Stocks, and grievouſly abuſed by cruel Executioners of wicked Mens Envy and Injuſtice; and upon ſuch Grounds
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:003104_0198_0FEFF4ADB91071B8"/>
only, and for ſuch Cauſes mentioned, and without the Tranſgreſſion of any juſt Law, have and do at this Day many Hundreds of faithful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſuffer hard and cruel Things, long and ſore Impriſonment, and cruel and ſharp Whipping, and Stocking, and unjuſt Baniſhment out of Towns and Cities; yea, Friend, it's hard to be expreſſed, and large to be declared, how many of the Lord's Servants do, and have ſuffered great Injuſtice in theſe Nations, thro' the Abuſe of good Government, and Degeneration of Magiſtracy, from its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect State and Place, whereunto it was ordained of God in the Beginning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Remonſtration, how powerful and large ſoever, had not it due Effect; but Perſecution continued, without being ſtopt by him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For the Churchmen fawned upon him, calling him not only their <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua,</hi> but the Preachers of <hi>Suffolk</hi> ſaid in their Addreſs to him,<note place="margin">

To which he anſwered, <hi>That he was over their Fires, and feared them not:</hi> And farther ask'd, <hi>Whether all People had been without a Faith theſe ſixteen Hundred Years, that now the Prieſt muſt make them one? And ſince Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus was the Author of the Apoſtle's Faith, and of the Church's Faith in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Times, and of the Martyrs Faith, ſhould not all People look unto him to be the Author and Finiſher of their Faith, and not unto the Prieſts?</hi> Nothing material was anſwered to this; for the Prieſts called <hi>G.

            <p>Now there was great Perſecution, both by Impriſonment, and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of Meetings; and many died in Priſons: For the Prieſts ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Evil of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> it did kindle the Inſolency of the Rabble not a little, ſo that they did not ſtick to throw Squibs into the Meetings, to caſt rotten Eggs on thoſe that were met, to beat on Drums and Kettles, and ſo to make a hideous Noiſe, and to abuſe People moſt grievouſly with Blows and violent Puſhes.</p>
            <p>One Day there being a Meeting appointed near <hi>London,</hi> they beat and abuſed about eighty Perſons that came out of the City to meet there, tearing their Coats and Cloaks from off their Backs, and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into Ditches and Ponds.

Prieſt, in the Preſence of Captain <hi>Geriſh,</hi> who had promiſed that they ſhould not ſuffer: But after the Conference was ended, the Captain would not let them go, but on Promiſe preſently to depart the Town. Which being loth to comply with, as they were on their Way, they were ſent for back, and Captain <hi>Geriſh</hi> riding after them, commanded them to return; which they refuſing, he compelled them thereunto, and ſent them with a Conſtable to <hi>Salem;</hi> where being brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Magiſtrates, they were asked, <hi>Whether they were Quakers?</hi> To which they anſwered, <hi>That they were ſuch that were in Scorn called ſo.</hi> Next it was objected to them, <hi>That they maintained dangerous Errors.</hi> They asking what theſe were, it was told them, <hi>That they not only denyed that Chriſt at</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>had ſuffered on the Croſs, but alſo that they denied the Holy Scriptures.</hi> They boldly contradicted this, and ſaid, <hi>They own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no other Jeſus but he that had ſuffered Death at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and that they alſo owned the Scriptures.</hi>

Some Days after, they were carried to <hi>Boſton,</hi> where, in the next Month they were brought into the Houſe of Correction, to work there. But they unwilling to ſubmit thereto, the Jailor, who ſought his Profit from the Work of his Priſoners, would not give them Victuals, tho' they offered to pay for them. But he told them, <hi>It was not their Money, but their Labour he deſired.</hi> Thus he kept them five Days without Food, and then with a three-corded Whip gave them twenty Blows. An Hour after, he told them, <hi>they might go out, if they would pay the Marſhal that was to lead them out if the Country.</hi> They judging it very unreaſonable to pay Money for being baniſhed, refuſed this; but yet ſaid, <hi>That if the Priſon-door was ſet open, they would go away.</hi> The next Day the Jailor came to <hi>W.

Thus he kept them from Five in the Morning, till after Nine at Night, being the Space of ſixteen Hours. The next Morning he brought them to the Mill to work, but <hi>Brend</hi> refuſing, the Jailor took a pitch'd Rope about an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nch thick, and gave him twenty Blows over the Back and Arms, with as much Force as he could, ſo that the Rope untwiſted; and then going away, he came again with another Rope that was thicker and ſtronger, and told <hi>Brend, that he would cauſe him to bow to the Law of the Country, and make him work. Brend</hi> judged this not only unreaſonable in the higheſt Degree, ſince he had committed no Evil; but he was alſo altogether unable to work; for he wanted Strength for want of Food, having been kept five Days without eating, and whipt alſo, and now thus unmercifully beaten with a Rope. But this inhuman Jailor relented not, but began to beat anew with his pitch'd Rope, on this bruiſed Body, and foaming at his Mouth like a Mad-man, with Violence laid fourſcore and ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Blows more on him, as other Priſoners who beheld it with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, have told; and if his Strength, and his Rope had not failed him, he would have laid on more; he threatned alſo to give him the next Morning as many Blows more. But a higher Power, who ſets Limits even to the raging Sea, and hath ſaid, <hi>Hitherto ſhalt thou come, but no farther,</hi> alſo limited this butcherly Fellow, who was yet impudently ſtout enough to ſay his Morning-prayer. To what a moſt terrible Condition theſe Blows brought the Body of <hi>Brend,</hi> (who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the great Heat of the Weather, had nothing but a Serge Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſock upon his Shirt) may eaſily be conceived: His Back and Arms were bruiſed and black, and the Blood hanging as in Bags under his
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:003104_0203_0FEFD562F4989980"/>
Arms; and ſo into one was his Fleſh beaten, that the Sign of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular blow could not be ſeen; for all was become as a Jelly. His Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy being thus cruelly tortured, he lay down upon the Boards, ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly weakened, that the natural Parts decaying, and Strength quite failing, his Body turned cold: There ſeemed as it were a Struggle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Life and Death, his Senſes were ſtopped; and he had for ſome Time neither Seeing, Feeling, nor Hearing: Till at length a divine Power prevailing, Life broke thro' Death, and the Breath of the Lord was breathed into his Noſtrils. Now the Noiſe of this Cruelty ſpread among the People in the Town, and cauſed ſuch a Cry, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor ſent his Surgeon to the Priſon to ſee what might be done: But the Surgeon found the Body of <hi>Brend</hi> in ſuch a deplorable Condition, that, as one without Hopes, he ſaid, <hi>His Fleſh would rot off his Bones, ere the bruiſed Parts could be brought to digeſt.</hi> This ſo exaſperated the People,<note place="margin">The Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates ſeem to relent in their Cruelty.</note> that the Rulers to prevent a Tumult, ſet up a Paper on their Meeting-houſe Door, and up and down the Streets, as it were, to ſhew their Diſlike of this abominable, and moſt barbarous Cruelty; and ſaid, the Jaylor ſhould be dealt withal the next Court. But this Paper was ſoon taken down again upon the Inſtigation of the High-Prieſt <hi>John Norton,</hi>
               <note place="margin">But are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd therein by their Prieſts.</note> (who having from the Beginning been a fierce Promoter of the Perſecution,) now did not ſtick to ſay, <hi>W.

In the mean while, it pleaſed God, even miraculouſly to heal <hi>W. Brend,</hi> and to keep him alive: But as if the Hearts of theſe Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors were more hardened thereby, to ſhew themſelves obedient Followers of their Teacher, they made an Order, that the Jailor, if the <hi>Quakers</hi> that were in his Cuſtody refuſed to work, ſhould whip them twice a Week, the firſt Time with Ten Laſhes, the next Time with fifteen, and ſo at each Time with three more, till they would work. This was performed on Four Perſons, two of which were <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Leddra</hi> and <hi>John Rous,</hi> who may be mentioned hereafter. And to keep the paſſionate Jailor within due Bonds, forſooth, it was ordered that each Time he ſhould warn two Conſtables to ſee the Execution. But how little Moderation was truly meant, and that this was more like a Jeſt, may appear in that the Jailor the firſt Time laid fifteen Laſhes a piece on the ſaid Perſons, and ſo added five Stripes to the firſt Number of ten.</p>
            <p>It happened about this Time that ſome of the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> that lived there, being had before the Magiſtrates, it was demanded by one of them, <hi>How they might know a</hi> Quaker? to which <hi>Simon Broadſtreet,</hi> one of the Magiſtrates, anſwered, <hi>Thou art one, for coming in with thy Hat on.</hi> Which made the other reply, <hi>It was a horrible Thing to make ſuch cruel Laws, to whip and cut off Ears, and bore thro' the Tongue for not putting off the Hat:</hi> Then one of the Bench ſaid, <hi>That the</hi> Quakers <hi>held forth Blaſphemies at thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

No better to prove Perſecution lawful was the Argument of <hi>Charles Chanſey,</hi> chief Teacher at the Univerſity, who in a Sermon at <hi>Boſton,</hi> argued

thus; <hi>Suppoſe you ſhould catch ſix Wolves in a Trap, and ye cannot prove that they killed either Sheep or Lambs; and now ye have them, they will neither bark nor bite; yet they have the plain Marks of Wolves, and therefore ye knock them down.</hi> A baſe Expreſſion thus to compare a Man to a Beaſt; for God ſaid in plain Terms to <hi>Noah, Whoſo ſheddeth Man's Blood, by Man ſhall his Blood be ſhed.</hi> But theſe Perſecutors thought there was Streſs enough in it, to call the <hi>Quakers</hi> Wolves; and to make one paſs for a <hi>Quaker,</hi> they counted it a ſufficient Proof, when they ſaw he did not put off his Hat to Men: Knock him down, 'tis a Wolf: And if the Hat was not found fault with, ſomething elſe was thought on; for at <hi>Salem</hi> twelve Perſons were fined forty Pounds nineteen Shillings for not coming to Church:<note place="margin">Several fined.</note> And of others much Money was extorted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Wives abſented themſelves from the publick Worſhip. <hi>William Marſton</hi> of <hi>Hampton</hi> was fined Ten Pounds for two Books found in his Houſe, <hi>viz. John Lilburn</hi>'s <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and <hi>W. Duesbury</hi>'s <hi>Mighty Day of the Lord.</hi> Thus theſe People did whatever they would, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Regard to the Laws in <hi>Old England:</hi> And when once ſome Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners appeal'd to it, the Governor <hi>John Endicot,</hi> and his Deputy <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingham</hi> cry'd, <hi>No Appeal to</hi> England! <hi>No Appeal to</hi> England! And they ſeem'd to fear nothing for what they did to the <hi>Quakers;</hi> according to what Major General <hi>Deniſon</hi> ſaid in open Court; <hi>This Year you'll go and complain to the Parliament; the next Year they'll ſend ſome to ſee how Things go; and in the third Year the Government will be chang'd.</hi> Now they not at all caring for Old <hi>England,</hi> denied alſo the Priſoners their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of being tried according to the Laws of that Realm, by a Jury. And the Rulers dealing thus arbitrarily,<note place="margin">Trial by a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry refus'd.</note> the Jailor of the Houſe of Correction did the like; for when ſome of his Priſoners ſhewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves not unwilling to work, provided that their Families ſhould have ſomething of the Gain, he would not allow that, unleſs they paid him Eight Pence from every Twelve Pence Gain: And when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed this, the Whipping-poſt was his Refuge.</p>

            <p>About this Time <hi>William Caton</hi> came again into <hi>Holland,</hi>

In Order thereto, it was thought meet that their religious Meetings, which on the Week-Days were kept pretty late at Night, on the Firſt-Days of the Week ſhould not always be kept in one Place, but ſometimes in this, and at other Times in another Houſe: Sometimes a Meeting was kept in an Alley, at the Town-Wall near the Regulars-Gate, where ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Engliſh</hi> People dwelt, from whence it was called the <hi>Engliſh Alley,</hi> and has that Name ſtill: Hither came very rude Company, committing great Inſolence. The Time before that <hi>W. Caton</hi> was in <hi>Holland,</hi> he met with an extraordinary rude Encounter at the ſaid Place, inſomuch that he ſeemed in Danger of his Life; for ſome wicked People, not daring to do their utmoſt in the Houſe where he was, puſh'd him out of Doors; but then a Woman pulled him into her Houſe, where he was ſafe, tho' at firſt he knew not whether he was among Friends or Foes. I yet well remember this Fact, being at that Time with my Parents in the ſaid diſturbed Meeting. Now <hi>Caton</hi> being a diſcreet and judicious Perſon, and perceiving that ſome of his Friends there had more of a raſh Zeal than true Wiſdom, adviſed the moſt moderate of them often to change Meeting-places. In the Beginning, a Meeting was kept now and then in St. <hi>John-ſtreet,</hi> ſo called, and afterwards on <hi>Eland</hi>'s <hi>Graff,</hi> in an Alley at the Houſe of one <hi>Richard Langham,</hi> and alſo on the <hi>Angelier's Graff,</hi> in the Houſe of my Father; and ſome Time after in the <hi>Engliſh Alley</hi> aboveſaid, and alſo without the Town, near the River <hi>Amſtel,</hi> in <hi>Kuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers Padt,</hi> or <hi>Cooper's-Lane;</hi> from whence the Meeting was removed in the Forepart of this Year (if my Memory doth not deceive me) into the <hi>Verwers Padt,</hi> or <hi>Dyers-Lane,</hi> which was then without the City-Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the Meeting-place was in a large Garret of a Tanner's Houſe, where oftentimes came abundance of People, and among theſe, not a few of the rude Rabble.

            <p>But to return to <hi>Ames,</hi> when ſome in the Palatinate began to give an Ear to his Preaching, a Fine was ſettled againſt thoſe that gave him Entertainment:<note place="margin">He is favor'd by the <hi>Elector</hi> and his Siſter.</note> But the Prince Elector being informed hereof, took off that Fine; and tho' thoſe of the Conſiſtory did ſend for <hi>Ames,</hi> the Prince generouſly order'd them not to meddle with him.

               <hi>W. Ames</hi> being at <hi>Rotterdam</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> was confined there in <hi>Bedlam;</hi> which having made a great Noiſe, I'll give a brief Relation of it here. At <hi>Moordrecht,</hi> a Village near <hi>Gouda,</hi> liv'd at that Time one <hi>Martin Martinſon,</hi> a Cooper by Trade; this Man approving the Doctrine preach'd by <hi>Ames</hi> at <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> and elſewhere,
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:003104_0210_0FEFF52AB46C0370"/>
began to aſſert it as Truth; and ſeeing now and then he with ſome of his ſober Neighbours, kept a Meeting at his Houſe,<note place="margin">The Occaſion thereof.</note> this cauſed a great Stir in the Town, inſomuch that ſometimes he ſuffered rude Treatment from the People. <hi>Ames</hi> coming once there, and keeping a Meeting in <hi>Martin</hi>'s Houſe, great Inſolence was committed by the wicked Rabble. And going from thence to paſs over the Water to <hi>Gouwerek,</hi> he was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by a Multitude of riotous People, both young and old, with a hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous Cry of <hi>Quake, Quake, Quake!</hi> and was pelted with Stones and Clods, till he came to the Boat that carried him over. The Preacher of <hi>Gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werek</hi> hearing the Noiſe, came to the Boat, and ask'd, <hi>What the Matter was, why People made ſuch a ſad Noiſe?</hi> To which <hi>Ames</hi> anſwer'd, <hi>It ſeems the People are not taught better.</hi> To which the Preacher return'd, <hi>They are not uſed to make ſuch ado againſt honeſt People; but I believe you to be a deceiving Wolf, that comes among the Sheep to ſeduce them, and that therefore they cry ſo. Prove this,</hi> reply'd <hi>Ames. I dont know you,</hi> ſaid the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. <hi>Learn then,</hi> return'd <hi>Ames, better Manners, than to call one thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not, a Wolf and a Deceiver.</hi> And ſo going his Way, ſhortly after he wrote from <hi>Rotterdam</hi> to <hi>Martin,</hi> and bad him go to the Preacher, and deſire him to appoint a Time to prove <hi>that</hi> Ames <hi>was a deceiving Wolf.</hi> But to this, the Preacher ſhew'd himſelf backward; yet to be rid of <hi>Martin,</hi> he ſaid at length, <hi>Come, I'll prove it preſently.</hi> But <hi>Martin</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, <hi>I am not come for that; but this muſt be done to</hi> Ames; and inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereon, <hi>Well,</hi> ſaid the Preacher, <hi>Let him come next</hi> Sunday <hi>before Noon, after Sermon; then I'll prove it publickly before all People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of this <hi>Martin</hi> ſent Word to <hi>Ames;</hi> but Things were managed ſo, that this Project of Proof was quaſh'd: For the Preacher of <hi>Gouwerek</hi> went to his Colleague at <hi>Moordrecht,</hi> and conſulted with him what to do in the Caſe; and <hi>Ames</hi> being come to <hi>Moordrecht</hi> on the firſt Day of the Month called <hi>March,</hi> and the laſt of the Week, tho' it was late at Night, was ſeen and known by ſome, who committed much Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence upon the Houſe of <hi>Martin,</hi> where <hi>Ames</hi> was entered. The next Day it was reported that ſome of the Sheriff's Men of <hi>Gouda</hi> were come to <hi>Gouwerek,</hi> to apprehend <hi>Ames</hi> when he came there; and at <hi>Moordrecht,</hi> the Dikegrave's Men came to the ſame Purpoſe; and ſo they took <hi>Ames</hi> Priſoner, and carried him to <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> where he was lock'd up in <hi>Bedlam,</hi> as a Madman. And a Week after, <hi>Martin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">As is alſo <hi>M. Martinſon.</hi>
               </note> for having kept Meetings at his Houſe, where not above eight Perſons were come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, was alſo by the Dikegrave's Men taken Priſoner in his Houſe, and carried to <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> where he was lock'd up with <hi>Ames.</hi> Who were the Inſtigators of this Buſineſs is plain enough, tho' I don't men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion them.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Ames</hi> had been not much above three Weeks in <hi>Bedlam,</hi> the Under-Governor of the Houſe, on the 27th of the Month about Night, came to him and <hi>Martin,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>If I was in your Place, I would go out.</hi> Which made <hi>Ames</hi> ask, <hi>Whether he would ſuffer them to do ſo?</hi> To which he anſwered, <hi>That he ſhould not hinder them.</hi> Then <hi>Ames return'd, I won't be reputed as one that broke Priſon.</hi> To which the Deputy reply'd, <hi>Nay, why ſhould you be reputed ſo? You may go out freely; all is unlock'd, and the Door will ſtand open for you: For the Governors are not minded that you ſhould ſtay here.</hi> Then <hi>Ames</hi> ſaid, <hi>Well, I intend to go out to Morrow.</hi> The next Day <hi>Martin</hi>'s Wife came to ſee her Husband; but the Deputy told her, that he had an Order in Writing from the Dikegrave, that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to let <hi>Martin</hi>'s Wife come to him, he might let him and <hi>Ames</hi> go out together. The Iſſue was, that they were both let out that Morning, it being the 28th of the Month. But they ſtaid at <hi>Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdam,</hi> intending not to depart the Town before they had given No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to the Dikegrave of their being let out; leſt any Qccaſion might
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:003104_0211_0FEFD57CECA00E98"/>
be given for ſaying that they had broken Priſon. And it was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reaſon they were ſo cautious: For the next Day in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Deputy came to them, and ſaid, <hi>I deſire that you won't bring me into Trouble; for I am am an ancient Man, and the</hi> Dikegrave <hi>hath been with me, and ask'd for you:</hi> To which I anſwer'd, <hi>That you were gone out; but he took this very ill. I deſire therefore that you would ſay, that you were gone out without my Knowledge.</hi> But this was not to be expected from <hi>Ames,</hi> whom I knew ſo well, that I truly believe he would rather have died, than to have ſpoken a Lie: For in ſuch a Caſe he was without Queſtion, of the ſame Mind as formerly <hi>Chriſtian Languedol,</hi> Uncle of my Grandmother by the Mother's Side, who when at <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp,</hi> he, with other Martyrs, was led to the Stake to be burnt, cry'd out immediately, and with a valiant Mind, <hi>If we would once but have told a Lye, we might have eſcaped this.</hi> But to return to <hi>Ames,</hi> he told the Deputy, <hi>That he himſelf intended to go and ſpeak with the</hi> Dikegrave, <hi>and if he was diſpleaſed at their going out, he might put them in again where they had been; for they would not have the Name of Priſon-breakers.</hi> Then they both went to the <hi>Dikegrave,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with the <hi>Dike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave.</hi>
               </note> and told him after what Manner they were come out; ſaying alſo, that they would not have it ſaid, that they broke out. <hi>That Name,</hi> ſaid the Dikegrave, <hi>you would have had, if you had departed the Town; for the Deputy hath told me that you got out by breaking a Window.</hi> After ſome other Words were exchanged, he further ſaid, <hi>I have nothing to object againſt your Life and Converſation, having heard no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing concerning you but a good Report; neither do I ſeek to perſecute you. But would you be willing to return to</hi> Bedlam? <hi>Ames</hi> anſwer'd, <hi>Here we ſtand before thee, thou may'ſt do with us according to thy Pleaſure. And if thou deſireſt us to return thither, we'll do ſo;</hi> The Dikegrave ſignifying, <hi>that this was his Deſire,</hi> ſaid, <hi>that they might go and walk in the Gallery then, till another Order came.</hi> And ſo he cauſed his Meſſenger to go along with them. Being come thither, they not long retained the Liberty to walk in the Gallery, but on the 31ſt of the Month they were lock'd up again, each in a Hole by himſelf. Now <hi>Ames</hi> acquainted the Deputy that he heard from the Dikegrave, <hi>that he had been informed by him, that they were got out by breaking a Window.</hi> But the Deputy denied to have ſaid ſo. They were detained there yet ſome Time, and were pretty much viſited, and this often by ſuch as ſought nothing but to ſcoff at them; and among theſe, a certain Clergyman did not ſtick to ſay to <hi>Ames, That he was a Deceiver, becauſe he wore Pewter Buttons, to make People believe they were Silver ones.</hi> Whilſt <hi>Ames</hi> was confined here, he wrote ſome Papers, which afterwards he gave out in Print, and among theſe, a Reply to an Anſwer of one <hi>Jacob Koelman,</hi> to 83 Queries given forth by the ſaid <hi>Ames;</hi>

But this was reſented to ſuch a high Degree, that by Order of the Mayor he was put into Priſon, and thruſt into a Hole call'd <hi>Little-Eaſe,</hi> which was ſo ſtrait, that it could not well receive his Body; but he was thruſt in with ſuch Violence, that his Body was bruiſed, and he ſpit Blood, and ſhortly after grew ſick, and his Body ſwelling, occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by the ſqueezing of it into the Hole, he died in great Pain.

               </note> containing a very remarkable Prediction of what followed the next Year, when King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second was placed on the Throne.

And as they have cauſed the Goods and Poſſeſſions of the Innocent to be ſpoiled, and made a Prey, even ſo in like Manner ſhall the Curſe of the Lord ſpoil their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. And as they have done, ſo ſhall it be done unto them; and as they have met to others, ſo ſhall it be met to them again. And I ſaw a great Miſery and Deſolation nigh at Hand, even the Sword of the Lord; and that it ſhould ſlay them; and I beheld it was made ready for the Slaughter; and in the Senſe of theſe Things, a Sadneſs fell upon my Spirit, conſidering the Deſolation and the Judgment that is at hand, to be executed upon the cruel Oppreſſors.</hi>

in his Dominion, and by his Spirit; this is once more a Warning to you from the Lord, and that theſe Things muſt ſurely come to paſs, and be fulfilled in their Seaſon, and no Man ſhall be able to deliver his Brother; but every Man ſhall bear his own Burthen, and drink his own Cup, prepared for him; and tho' it hath been counted a light Thing among you, and you have deſpiſed the Reproof, and gone on without Fear; yet in as much as the Lord hath ſpared you, and not ſpeedily executed Judgment upon you, but rather waited for your Return; yet the Dealing of the Lord towards you, in ſparing of you, you have not accepted; and therefore ſhall his Judgments be the greater upon you, For if you do now come to the Witneſs in your own Conſciences, What Evil have this People done? Whoſe Ox have they taken, or what have they deſired of you? Or what have they ſought from you? Or wherein have they been a Burthen to you? Saving that they have reproved you for your Iniquities, and deſired your Redemption? Would you but now at laſt come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this, and confeſs the Truth in your Conſciences; will not that tell you, that they have patiently ſuffered all Things that you have cruelly impoſed upon them? And have not they walked peaceably to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, and humbly, meekly and juſtly among their Neighbours? And have they not been meek and innocent, even as Lambs, and as Sheep before the Shearers? and have they wrought Offences towards any? Have they ſought the Overthrow of the Government, or have they ſought Vengeance againſt their Enemies? Or what Injury have they done to any Man's Perſon or Eſtate, ſaving to Satan and his Kingdom? Have they not ſought to reform and reclaim the Ungodly from their Ways? And have they not pitied and prayed for their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies? And have they not in all Things walked in good Conſcience towards the Lord, and towards all Men? Yea, my Friends, in the Day of the Lord, when the Witneſs in your Conſciences ſhall not be limited, but ſhall ſpeak plainly, and when the impartial Judge ſhall appear upon his Throne, then ſhall you acknowledge theſe Things.
Wherefore I ſay unto you, receive the Judgment of the Lord, to purify you, otherwiſe the Judgment ſhall deſtroy you; and now come to be more wiſe, that ſome of you may be as a Brand pluck'd out of the Fire, and be reſerved from being conſumed; for the Viſitation of the Lord is near an End, when his loving Kindneſs will be ſhut from you, and his Long-ſuffering turned into Fury; and he will make you know that we are his People, with whom you have thus dealt; yea, you ſhall ſuddenly know it; the Time is not long till he will crown his People in the Sight of his Enemies; he will crown them with Praiſe and with Righteouſneſs, with Honour and Majeſty, and he will keep them in Safety, even when Sorrow compaſſes you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout; his Mercy and loving Kindneſs ſhall extend towards them, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when his Wrath and Judgments doth ſmite you, and confound you. O! what ſhall I ſay unto you; for the deep Senſe thereof re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains upon my Heart; for when I conſider, how that in all Ages the Lord did avenge his People's Cauſe, and when the Time of their Suffering was expired, he broke the Bonds of Iniquity, and ſet them free. Thus did he with his People <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, and many Times it was his Way with his People, to bring them low by Suffering, and then to raiſe them up again in Glory; and he ſuffered their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies for a Seaſon to glory over them, that he might bring them down. And thus he did in <hi>England,</hi> in the Caſe between the Biſhops and their Crew of Perſecutors, and the poor People at that Day called <hi>Puritans:</hi> Did not he confound that perſecuting Crew, and deliver his People?

Yea, doubtleſs, and much more will he do, inaſmuch as the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of Truth is more clear than it was in their Days; and in as much as the Rulers and People of this Nation have rejected a more clear Teſtimony, than either the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in Quoen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Days, or the Biſhops and Prelates in their Days; even ſo much the more will the Lord execute his Vengeance with more Violence, in a more manifeſt Way; and all ſhall know, that it is he that doth it, and he will ſet his People free; for he hath regarded their Sufferings, and he hath ſaid, it is enough; for he hath tried them, and found them faithful; and all this hath been ſuffered to prove them, and not to deſtroy them: And like as he hath preſerved them in Patience and Peace thro' it all, even ſo will he give them Hearts to walk anſwerably to their Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; and us they have abounded in Patience in their Suffering, ſo ſhall they abound in Pra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But again when I conſidered the long Suffering, and Patience, and Forbearance of the Lord's innocent People under all their Sufferings; and when I looked at their Innocency, and at their Righteouſneſs, and Spirit of Holineſs with which the Lord had bleſſed them, my Heart was made glad in the Conſideration of this; and the more was my Joy, the more I beheld their Innocency, and the Guiltleſneſs of their Cauſe, whereby the Unjuſtneſs of their Suffering did the more appear; and withal, when I looked and beheld their Increaſe under all their Sufferings, and how that the Lord had turned all theſe Things to their Good, and to the Overthrow of all their Enemies; how that by that Way, wherein their Enemies intended to deſtroy them from being a People, even thereby did the Lord moſt wonderfully increaſe them to be a great People; for thro' all have they grown in Life and Power, and in Strength, and in Number, and thro' it all have they been encouraged to follow the Lord with more Zeal and Boldneſs. Add in the Conſideration of this I did rejoice, with magnifying the Lord for ever, that he had brought forth his Praiſe, even thro' the Wickedneſs of the Wicked, and he had increaſed his People, and exalted them thro' the Cruelty of all their Enemies; and that thro' all Oppoſition they were attain'd unto a happy Reſt, and thro' all the Tempeſt of great Trials, they were arrived into the Harbour of Renown and great Glory: And wher I conſider this, how that the Lord had given them Dominion, and brought their Life to reign over all their Enemies, theſe Things were a Joy unto me; and looking back into Ages, ſeeing there was nothing, nor any People for Generations, that had grown, and riſen thro' all Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion like unto theſe, wherefore it is a Sign and a Teſtimony that we are the Lord's, and that theſe Things are of him, and from him, and by him alone, that he might be praiſed for ever.
Again, when I do conſider, how that the Lord hath raiſed his People, even out of the Duſt; and them that were not a People, are become a People; and the Lord hath provoked Nations by them that were not a People within theſe few Years; and the Lord hath carried on this Work among his People, not by any Thing of Man, nor by the Arm of Fleſh, but in pure Innoceney and Simplicity hath
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:003104_0215_0FEFF4F22C4511A0"/>
it been accompliſhed; not by the Wiſdom of this World, nor by Men in Places of Honour, and of Power in the Nations; for all that has been wanting to them, and what they are, it is thro' the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of all this; for they have had none of the great Men of the Earth on their Side to defend them, and eſtabliſh them, but all have been againſt them, and even Oppreſſion and Tyranny executed upon them, rather than any Approbation, or Juſtification from Men in outward Authority: So that truly it may be ſaid, there hath been nothing of Man in this Work, but all of the Lord, by his own Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and in a contrary Way to all the falſe Sects, and falſe Churches, hath the Beginning and carrying on of theſe Things been; for we know that all the falſe Sects in this Nation have riſen, and been eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed thro' the Countenance of Men in Place and Power, and upon Man, and the Wiſdom of this World, and Authority of the Powers of the Earth, hath the Riſe and Fall of all falſe Churches depended: And as the Powers of the Earth have ſided with them, ſo have they been ſet up; and at the Diſpleaſure of Authority, have been caſt down. But as for this People, they are raiſed of the Lord, and eſtabliſhed by him, even contrary to all Men; and they have given their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er only to God, and they cannot give their Power to any mortal Men, to ſtand or fall by any outward Authority, and to that they cannot ſeek; but to the Lord alone, who heareth their Cry, and will avenge their Cauſe.
Wherefore let all the Perſecutors bow before the Lord, and let all the Saints walk humbly in his Sight, and let them continue in that innocent Life in which they have begun; and let them never forget the Mercies of the Lord, and what he hath brought to paſs, who hath manifeſted great Things, and will do more and more to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding of all his Enemies, and to the Praiſe of his elect People. And all ye Saints upon the Earth, have ye the Lord in Reſpect continually, and turn you not unto Idols, but let the Lord be your Joy for evermore.</p>

               </note> and had ſome Diſcourſe with the chiefeſt of them in their Garden, concerning the Light of Chriſt, that every Man is enlightned withal; and they told them, <hi>That the mighty Day of the Lord was at Hand upon them, and that the Lord was come to ſearch

            <p>
               <hi>The mighty Day of the Lord is come and coming upon you, and all the World: Awake, awake, ye that ſleep in the Earth, for the dreadful God is ariſing to plead with you, and to give unto all the World the Cup of his fierce Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, becauſe of your Idolatries, and Hypocriſies, and Abominations, which have corrupted the Earth, and are come up before him, and have provoked him; and the Cry of the Juſt, who hath been ſmitten and laid ſlain, is entred into the Ears of the Moſt High, and his Sword, which is the Word of his Mouth, is awakened to wound and ſlay all his Enemies. And the Day of your Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is now come, wherein the Lord is ſearching you, and trying you, that he may recompence you: And this is the Word of the Lord to you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wherefore I am moved of the Lord to propound ſome few</hi> Queries <hi>to you, for the Trial of your Spirits and Ways; to which I demand your Anſwer, that all Things may be brought to Light and true Judgment, and that you may be judged juſtly, and by the Spirit of the Lord cleared, or condemned, according to your Deeds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Queries</hi> were partly concerning the Orders of Friars and Nuns, whether any ſuch were in the Church in the Apoſtles Days; and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Popiſh Worſhip and Ceremonies, demanding Proof of their Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs from the holy Scriptures. After the delivering of theſe <hi>Queries</hi> to the <hi>Capuchins, Burroughs</hi> and <hi>Fiſher</hi> went alſo to the Friars of other Orders, and entred into Diſcourſe with them: But their plain Speeches againſt their Idolatrous Rites and Ceremonies,<note place="margin">Diſcourſe with thoſe of other Orders.</note> found no Entrance. After ſome Stay in the Town, they going to the College of the Jeſuits, got into Diſcourſe with their chief Rector; and after a Conference of about three Hours, he grew weary, and pretending other Buſineſs,<note place="margin">And with the chief Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits.</note> would ſtay no longer with them; and ſo they parted, asking him, <hi>Whether he would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit more Diſcourſe at ſome other Time?</hi> But he refuſed it. <hi>Burroughs</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards wrote a Letter to him, which began thus:</p>
            <p>Friend, <hi>Thy Wiſdom and thy Knowledge is earthly and ſenſual,<note place="margin">Writes to him.</note> and thereby canſt thou not know the Things of the Kingdom of God;</hi> And he concluded with this Query: <hi>What is that Whore that hath ſate upon Multitudes of People! And what is that golden Cup in her Hand?<note place="margin">Propoſes a Query.</note> And what are the Abominations and Fornication of which her Cup is full, which ſhe hath cauſed the Kings and People to drink?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But neither this <hi>Query,</hi> nor the others were anſwered. <hi>Burroughs</hi> and <hi>Fiſher</hi> did alſo viſit the Nuns; and ſpeaking to them thro' a Grate,<note place="margin">Nor this, nor others anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> they asked, <hi>If they were of the Order of thoſe called</hi> Quakers; and ſoon perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were ſuch, they ſaid, <hi>They might not hear them,</hi> and ſo preſently paſſed away; whereby <hi>Burroughs</hi> and <hi>Fiſher</hi> were deprived of an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to ſpeak to them; only they witneſſed againſt them. <hi>E. Burroughs</hi> wrote alſo ſome Propoſitions to the Jeſuits, Prieſts, and Friars,<note place="margin">Propoſitions in <hi>Latin</hi> ſent to the Jeſuits.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he particularly repreſented the Tyranny of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in true Colours; and theſe Propoſitions were ſent to them in <hi>Latin.</hi> They ſtand yet ſome few Days in Town, and had divers Meetings among the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Soldiers: And <hi>Burroughs</hi> alſo wrote to them,<note place="margin">Have Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings among the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Soldiers.</note> and bid them <hi>to be faithful to the Lord, and not to ſeek themſelves in their Service, but the Honour of God:</hi> He alſo ſhewed them what their Duty was in their military Station; and not to give them too rough a Bruſh,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>E. Burroughs</hi> writes to them</note> but to meet them ſomewhat in their own Way; following therein the Example of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> when he ſpoke to the Soldiers, <hi>Luke</hi> iii. 14. told them, <hi>What do you know but the Lord may have ſome good Work for you

to do,<note place="margin">His Advice to Soldiers and Officers.</note> if you be faithful to him?</hi> And he alſo ſignified unto them, <q>That ſince the Lord one Day would avenge the innocent Blood ſhed in the Pope's Dominions, and appear againſt <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> the Seat of the Whore, and the Kingdom of Antichriſt, it ſeem'd not improbable to him, that the Lord would make Way thereto by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation.</q> 
               <hi>It is,</hi> ſaid he <hi>the Lord's Work, I know, to make Men truly religious; but yet he may work by you to break down the Bryars and Thorns, and the Rocks and Hills that have ſet themſelves againſt the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. He alſo adviſed them, if ever ſuch a Work fell to be their Lot, <hi>not to be ambitious nor vain-glorious; but to make it their Work to demand the Diſannulling of the Popiſh Inquiſition and cruel Laws.</hi> And the Officers he charged, <hi>not to be as Tyrants and Oppreſſors over the poor Soldiers, but to be loving and meek, and Examples of all Goodneſs unto them:</hi> To this he added, <hi>And having no Sin lying upon your Conſciences, then ye ſhall face your Enemies with Courage, and not fear Death, but ſhall be ready to lay down your Lives in a good Cauſe.</hi> But left any might think he was for the Bearing of Arms, and not for Harmleſneſs or Non-reſiſtance, he told them alſo, <hi>That the Lord had a more honourable Work to work after them,</hi> viz. <hi>to deſtroy the Kingdom of the Devil, and the Ground of Wars.</hi> And <hi>that there was a more honourable Victory to be waited for,</hi> to wit, <hi>the Victory over Sin,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Burroughs</hi> and <hi>Fiſher</hi> being once ſent for by the Governor <hi>Lockhart,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Beth ſent for by Governor <hi>Lockhart</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Not long after, <hi>Burroughs</hi> gave the foreſaid Queries out in Print, and wrote alſo a Paper to the Parliament, exhorting thoſe that were Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that Aſſembly, to fear God, and not to oppreſs honeſt People, but to free them from Oppreſſion and Tyranny; <hi>leſt the Lord come ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly upon them, and break them to Pieces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Power of the Protector <hi>Richard Cromwel</hi> already declining,<note place="margin">Affairs of State</note> he was prevailed upon by the Officers of the Army to diſſolve this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, which began to make Enquiry how the Subſidies were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd: And by the Direction of ſome of the chief Republicans, the Long Parliament was called again. This Parliament ſet up a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Safety,</hi> for apprehending thoſe that diſturbed the Peace, and for making an Alteration among the military Officers, either by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheering them, or otherwiſe; and encreaſing in Power, erected alſo a <hi>Council of State;</hi> and Word was ſent to <hi>Richard Cromwel,</hi> who was now deprived of all Power,<note place="margin">R. Cromwel <hi>removes from</hi> Whitehall.</note> to remove from <hi>Whitehall;</hi> which at length he did, the Parliament allowing him two thouſand Pounds for the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Removing, and promiſing to pay his Debts contracted for the Publick: And his Brother <hi>Henry,</hi> who was Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> was called back by the Parliament. Thus theſe two Brothers were again reduced to the ſtate of private Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>E. Burroughs</hi> now wrote a Letter to the Parliament, and ſeriouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them therein, <q>To deſiſt from all Perſecution for Religion, and to take away that which gave Occaſion thereunto.</q> About this Time,<note place="margin">

from the Truth they profeſſed, <hi>G. Fox</hi> wrote a Paper, wherein he ſhewed <q>The Unlawfulneſs of Wars and Fightings, repreſenting it as a Work not at all becoming the Followers of Chriſt:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>G Fox</hi> writes a Paper of the Unlawfulneſs of Wars.</note> And he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted his Friends not to join with thoſe that took up Arms, but to fight only with Spiritual Weapons, which took away the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Carnal.</q> This he alſo recommended in his Preaching, for an harmleſs and innoſſenſive Life was that which he always aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and practiſed.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Booth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Booth</hi> is de feated, taken, and ſent to the Tower.</note> he was defeated, and endeavouring to make his Eſcape in Woman's Clothes, was diſcovered in an Inn, and taken into Cuſtody; and being carried to <hi>London,</hi> by an Order of the Parliament, he was committed to the <hi>Tower.</hi> The Officers of the Army, of which <hi>George Fleetwood</hi> was now Commander in chief, were very buſy to get the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perhand of the Parliament; which cauſed great Diviſion and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction in the Nation; for it was well known, that if the ſupreme Power was offer'd up to the Army, they then could do what they would; and thus the Nation would be governed by the Sword. It was alſo freſh in Memory, that it was the Army by which <hi>Cromwel</hi> had been advanced ſo as to become Protector, and ſupreme Ruler of the Nation: And therefore many oppoſed the Deſign on foot.</p>
            <p>About this Time, alſo the Military Officers moved the Taking off of the Burthen of Tithes, and to ſettle another Maintenance for the National Preachers. But being unwilling that the Parliament ſhould be Maſters of the Army, they complained of having been deceived by the Parliament; and Colonel <hi>Desborough</hi> ſaid, <q>That they had not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed any part of the Promiſes they had made to the Army; that they had taken no Care to ſecure a Liberty to tender Conſciences; and that their Intention was to remove the principal Officers, and place others in their Commands, who were of different Principles.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Council of Officers was for calling a new Parliament; but this met with no ſmall Oppoſition. In this Buſtle the Council of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers began to inſinuate with the Clergy, and they agreed with them, That their Maintenance by Tithes ſhould not be taken away till ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Revenue as ample and certain ſhould be ſettled upon them: That ſome Proviſion ſhould be made for thoſe who differed in Faith and Worſhip from the eſtabliſhed Church; but that the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and ſome others, whoſe Principles they ſaid tended to the Deſtruction of civil Society, ſhould not be tolerated at all.

True it is, ſuch hath been the coming to paſs of Time, and of Things, for many Ages by-paſt, that my Maſter hath been, as it were, baniſhed from the Nation, and hath not been ſuffered to enjoy his Right, but hath been expelled, even, as it were, by the Force of Satan and Antichriſt, who hath long uſurp'd Authority over the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of this Nation; and in my Maſter's Abſence lamentable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, Cruelty, Unmercifulneſs, Tyranny and Oppreſſion hath been exerciſed upon the Inhabitants, and the poor Creatures have been held in great Slavery by their Rulers, that have ruled by the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon's Power, and been kept in great Blindneſs and Ignorance, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der great Oppreſſion both in Body and Spirit, by antichriſtian Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, for this many Years, even while the great King hath been ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and as it were gone into a far Country; even all this Time hath Antichriſt and the Devil ruled and reigned, and have made and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted Oppreſſion and tyrannical Laws and Decrees, both in Church and State; and all the Nation hath been out of right Order, and laid waſte and barren of good Fruit, and it hath been as a Wilderneſs by reaſon hereof; and Men that have ruled for many Years, have not ruled ſingly by my Maſter's Authority, but by another Power, tho' not without the Knowledge of my Lord, neither as tho' he had not Power to have done otherwiſe; but for his own Pleaſure he hath ſuffered it thus to be, and let Men go on to rule and govern in their own Wills, and after their own Luſts; and People have walked wickedly towards him, and towards one another; and all this he hath ſuffered, not as if he gave Toleration for it; for his Meſſengers now and then, and his Witneſs in Peoples Conſciences, have been reproving their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Ways, and he hath often ſhewed his Diſlike by divers Ways and Tokens, and many Judgments, and ſtrange Overturning, to the Way and Proceeding of both Rulers, Prophets, and Teachers of this Nation; but yet they have gone on againſt his Mind, and contrary to his Will, notwithſtanding his Reproofs and Judgments: Not that he had not Power to have executed his Pleaſure in Wrath upon them, and to have deſtroy'd them altogether, and have made the Nation a Heap, and as nothing long before this Day; for Power was in his Hand to have done it; but he hath been long-ſuſfering, and of great Patience, and born all Things, and taken the Injuſtice, and Cruelty, and Wickedneſs, and Idolatry, and all Unrighteouſneſs that hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded in the Nation, upon himſelf, and ſuffered under it, and born it for its Seaſon, while woful and lamentable Oppreſſions have been practiſed in civil State, even helliſh Laws, and deviliſh Executors of them; mercileſs Tyrants have born the Scepter, and reigned for many Years over the Inhabitants, and in Church and State has been heinous Idolatry and ſuperſtitious Vanities committed in a high Nature and Meaſure, and even all Men, and States of Men, and Orders of Men of every Degree have been abominably corrupted in the Sight of my Lord, even from the <hi>Prince</hi> to the <hi>Beggar,</hi> even Rulers and Subjects, Teachers and People, Judges and Prophets, they have been corrupted both in Heart and Hand, and they have dealt falſely and wickedly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, and towards one another, even to the great Diſpleaſure and Vexation of him, and his bleſſed Spirit, and to the high Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him to their own Deſtruction, if his Long-ſuffering had not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed;

and all this while he hath lain as it were aſleep, and at reſt in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and he hath left Men to try them, what they will do, and he hath given them a Day; many Kings and Rulers he hath let them have a little Time, to ſee how they would uſe it; but they have abuſed it, and not ruled for him, nor accompliſhed his Work, nor fulfilled his Will, but acted even in Defiance of him, and of his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and to his great Diſhonour.
Alack! I muſt be plain with you: My Lord hath been utterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iled, and greatly diſhonoured, and highly provoked and vexed, by reaſon of ſuch Proceedings, as have been in this Nation for theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Years, thro' the Corruption of all Sorts of Men in Place and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, who have not ruled for him, but for the Devil, to their own corrupted Ends; only he hath ſuffered Men to go on in their Courſe for a Seaſon; ſome as it were appearing on the Stage for a Time, and ſuddenly caſt down again for their Iniquities Sake; and his Hand hath been in all theſe Things, tho' very privately and ſecretly, not known and diſcerned by the Sons of Men, yet hath he ruled over the Kingdoms of Men, and pulled down one, and ſet up another. And to forbear the ſeveral Actings and Proceedings of many by-paſſed Ages, and to come to this Generation, and to ſpeak of Things that have happened within theſe few Years, and of the Changing and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning that hath happened in this Nation; ſuch was the Cruelty, Tyranny, Oppreſſion and Idolatry, both in Church and Civil State, that the People of this Nation were held under, in the Days of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Power;</hi> ſuch, I ſay, was the exceeding Height of the Cruelty and Tyranny of that Time, that not any that feared or reverenced my Lord, in any Meaſure, could ſcarce live, or have a Being in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; even againſt every Man that did but incline towards him, and deſire the Knowledge of his Ways, Hell's Mouth was opened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and they were ſwallowed up, and many of their Lives taken from the Earth, by the Helliſh Power that had in that Day uſurped Authority in this Iſland; and when thus it was, then he looked down from Heaven, and his Bowels of Compaſſion were open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the Sake of the oppreſſed People that deſired after him, in ſo much that he broke and threw down the Power of their Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors in ſome Meaſure, as it ſtood in Papal Authority; and when the Iniquity of that Power was filled up, he took Vengeance upon it; and I muſt tell you, it was he that brought it about, even the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying of that Power in this Nation, and freeing the Nation from it, tho' the Men that were Inſtruments in the Cauſe were not his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, otherwiſe than as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> ſerved him; for he hath a ſecret Way to have a Service from the Wicked, and ſuch is his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that he can turn the Wickedneſs of the Wicked to his Glory, and he can make a Rod to whip his Adverſaries, and burn it when he hath done, and he hath often deſtroyed one Wickedneſs by another.

upon them, even almoſt to the rooting out of Righteouſneſs, and to the grieving of the Lord's Spirit: Well then, becauſe of the Cry of the People, and the Oppreſſion of the Nation under that Authority, my Lord looked down again, and even for his Name's Sake, and for his Seed's Sake, he had Compaſſion on this Nation, to ſet it free, and to break off its Oppreſſions; and in a great Meaſure he did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the People of this Nation in many Things, and there was a Part of Reformation wrought, and much pretended and looked for; and all this came to paſs thro' him, and my Lord did accompliſh it, however the Inſtruments by which he wrought proved deceitful, and became Oppreſſors, as others before them: and tho' there was in this Nation a Day of great Troubles, and Wars, and Contention, and great Strife, and the waſting of much Blood, and earthly Treaſure; and none of theſe Things I muſt tell you, fell without the ordering of my Maſter's Hand; yet ſo it was, and came to paſs, that after this Nation was reſtored to Peace, tho' much Unrighteouſneſs and Injuſtice was removed, yet there was much alſo left behind; and Men that he had uſed as Inſtruments in his Hand, in a good Work, and to whom he had given Wiſdom and Underſtanding, and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in much Mercy and in great Deliverance; yet they even turned to ſeek themſelves, and became corrupted in the Spoils of their Enemies, and when Peace and Plenty abounded, the Lord was forgotten again; and then the Land fell under Oppreſſors, and began again to cry out for Freedom, even when other Horns of the firſt Beaſt ſprang up, and went on each of them after his Follow; and tho' one Horn has ſtriven to break another, yet after <hi>one</hi> hath been caſt down, <hi>another hath riſon, and made an Image to the firſt,</hi> and ruled and reigned by the ſame Spirit and Authority, derived from the Dragon's Power in Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and Oppreſſion, and made Laws, and executed them to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of the Lord, and to the great Oppreſſion of his People, and to the filling of this Iſland with Injuſtice and Cruelty, even from one <hi>Generation to another,</hi> until this Day: And thus up and down have Times and Seaſons been altered, Powers and Authority changed and altered, Statutes, Laws and Decrees, changeable and alterable; <hi>for as the Iniquity of one Power was; filled up, that was caſt down, and another had its Day, till the Meaſure thereof was alſo filled up, that it might partake of the ſame Judgments.</hi> And in all theſe Overturnings, Breakings-down and Overthrowings, the <hi>very Hand of my Lord hath been,</hi> tho' ſecretly, and not diſcerned, yet his Power hath brought about, and ſuffered all theſe Things to come to paſs and who ſhall charge him with Injuſtice? Or, who ſhall ſay, <hi>What haſt thou done!</hi> Or, <hi>Why haſt thou done it?</hi> For, as I have ſaid, he is a high and mighty Prince, and can do whatſoever he will; and he is the ſupream Power mad Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, <hi>which rules and reigns in, and over all the Kingdoms of Men.</hi> And what tho' he hath uſed wicked Men <hi>as an Inſtrument</hi> to accompliſh his Work, and made the Wicked his Rod, and even brought it to paſs, <hi>that one Wickedneſs ſhould deſtroy another, and one Oppreſſor break down another, and the Kingdom of Antichriſt confound it ſelf;</hi> yet what of all theſe Things? All Fleſh muſt be ſilent before him, and all People, and the whole Earth muſt be ſubject unto him; for the Government and Dominion over Heaven and Earth is his, and all Power and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion belongeth to him alone, and all Judgment is in his Hand, to bring to paſs whatſoever he will, and by whomſoever as he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
But now, my Friends, tho' I would not be tedious to you, yet I muſt I tell you the Truth, and faithfully deliver the Lord's Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage unto you; and as concerning this laſt <hi>Overturning,</hi> there was

ſomething of the Hand of my Lord in it; and he can, and will bring forth his own Work and Praiſe by it, and it ſhall be for the Good of all his People, that wait upon him, tho' there was much <hi>Ambition and corrupted Ends in the Inſtruments,</hi> and neither Part were perfectly ſingle to the Lord in their Proceedings; but their Work was tainted with the falſe idolatrous Spirit of Self-Seeking: Yet notwithſtanding, the Lord may bring forth his Government, and his pleaſant Plant, thro' and beyond all this, even out of another Root, which yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears not among either ot them; and Righteouſneſs may ariſe in the Nation, contrary to both of them, out of another Stem, and he will ſet up his Kingdom; and in the mean Time, <hi>leave one Potſherd of the Earth to break another.</hi>
And as for you, that now ſit on the <hi>Throne,</hi> and bear Rule, whether <hi>Committee of Safety,</hi> (ſo called) chiefly, tho' it is not without my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; for he hath the Knowledge of it at leaſt; yet you are not the only Men of his Choice, truly called of him to the Place of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, neither is your Government the Government of the Lamb; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt it be for ever eſtabliſhed by him; its <hi>Foundation is not bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, nor can its Building be proſperous:</hi> For why?

And the late ſundry Overturnings in this Nation may be Examples to you, that you follow not the Steps of thoſe that God hath caſt out, leſt you come to the ſame End of Confuſion and Miſery: For, as concerning
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:003104_0224_0FEFF53CC2DBB080"/>
that Aſſembly of Men, that laſt ſate on the Throne, ſomething was done by them in their Day and Time, and in both their Aſſemblings, in ſome Things they ſerved my Lord, and they were a Rod in his Hand to ſmite his Enemies; yet they were not faithful to the End, till all his Enemies were deſtroyed, but rather joined themſelves to fight againſt the Lord and his People, and were haſtening on towards the Way of Oppreſſion and Perſecution; and it was Time for the Lord to remove them, and to lay them aſide as an empty Veſſel, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time uſeful; and to break them as a Rod, ſometime of Service to be a Scourge upon his Enemies: And when the Day of their Trial was over, which God gave unto them, being any longer (for preſent) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit Inſtruments for his Hand, then he caſt them into the Fire; and this his Purpoſe came to paſs upon them: So that they and the whole Nation may be contented, and yield themſelves ſubject to what he hath done concerning them; for they being entring into the very ſame Spirit of <hi>Wickedneſs,</hi> of <hi>Oppreſſion</hi> and <hi>Perſecution,</hi> which the Lord had once reproved thro' them, and caſt out by them; then was a <hi>Rod</hi> raiſed up againſt them, even as they had been againſt others, and they were dealt withal as they had done to others; and this was in the Juſtice of my Lord's Hand: <hi>And what hath mortal Man to queſtion his Proceedings?</hi> And tho' ſome of you (preſent Rulers) be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as <hi>great Traytors</hi> and <hi>Tyrants</hi> in your Dealing towards them, and doubtleſs the Men of that Part will ſeek Vengeance againſt you, even by <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>Praying,</hi> and they will curſe you in the Name of their <hi>God,</hi> and ſeek continually your <hi>Deſtruction,</hi> as ſuch as have taken away Part of their <hi>Strength,</hi> and <hi>caſt down their Idol;</hi> but alas! all this is nothing; for the Lord doth not account as Men: For theſe Things muſt needs thus come to paſs, for the Furtherance of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that it may ariſe thro' all; and if you were but faithful to what the Lord requires of you in your Proceedings, what you have done unto them ſhould not be reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned on Account againſt you, neither by God nor good Men. But and if you of the Army be always treacherous and diſobedient to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, and abuſe your Power, and diſregard your Price, that God hath given you, and trifle away your Hour about Places of Honour, and ſuch ſelf-ſeeking Matters, and the Cauſe of God be neglected by you, and his People continued oppreſſed Sufferers under you, as they have long been;<note place="margin">A remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Prophecy.</note>

Wherefore that you may be warned, I adviſe you to be faithful, let not the Cauſe of God fall, nor the Cauſe of his Enemies proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per before you; for there is no other Way whereby you can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, nor no other Defence ſhall you ever find from the Wrath of the Lord, and from the Fury of your devouring Enemies, than your Faithfulneſs in God's Cauſe; and therefore relieve the Oppreſſed, and take off all Oppreſſions, break down all unjuſt Laws, and ſet all People free from unjuſt Burdens, and let all Oppreſſion ceaſe, both in Church and Civil State; and even all oppreſſive Laws, and unjuſt

                  <p>And I muſt tell you plainly, As for theſe Men called Miniſters, in this Nation, the Way of their ſetting up, and ſending forth, and the Way of their Maintenance, and the Way of their Standing and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and in every Particular of their being ſuch, they are the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt woful Oppreſſion in the Nation, even the moſt abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and unjuſt Cruelties and Tyrannies are acted thro' them, as any 'other Thing in the Nation, and they are (as ſuch aforeſaid) the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Cauſe of the Nation's groaning under mercileſs Dealing; and there is upon their Account the Guilt of <hi>Blood, Injuſtice,</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſion</hi> lying upon this Nation; their Iniquities, their Iniquities cry for Vengeance upon their own Heads; for they are <hi>full,</hi> they are <hi>full,</hi> and the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thereof is near finiſhed, and God's eternal Vengeance is their next Reward from the eternal God. What ſhall I ſay of them, but this? The Earth is oppreſſed by them, the Inhabitants groan under

them, and the righteous God is vexed thro' them, and they are the very Men of high Indignation and fierce Wrath, and all their Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (as ſuch) are the Fewel of his Anger, to be conſumed by the Fire of his Jealouſy; the Nation is weary, and its Inhabitants, and the Lord is weary becauſe of theſe Men: And is this the Miniſtry cried up by you as <hi>godly</hi> and <hi>pious,</hi> &amp;c? Are theſe the Men that the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt be forced to maintain in their <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Idolatry?</hi> Is this the Miniſtry that muſt be encouraged? Well, if theſe be the Men, and this the Miniſtry which muſt be eſtabliſhed and encouraged by you, in ſo doing you ſhall never proſper, but thereby gain the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of the Almighty unto you, to bring a Curſe upon all your Doings, even becauſe hereof; for I muſt <hi>tell you,</hi> the Hand of my Lord is againſt them, and whoſoever ſhall ſeek to defend them, <hi>ſhall not proſper in their Doings;</hi> becauſe their <hi>Oppreſſions, Cruelties, Deceit,</hi> and <hi>Abominations</hi> are nigh <hi>finiſhed and fulfilled:</hi> Wherefore take Heed unto your ſelves, for this is my Maſter's Advice unto you; <hi>Let this Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry alone, and join not your ſelves to</hi> Baal, <hi>leſt you periſh, neither take Part with Antichriſt any longer, neither be ye Fighters againſt the Lamb and his Kingdom; but free the Nation, and let all its Inhabitants be freed from the cruel Tasks and Yokes of ſuch Men, and ſuch a Miniſtry as aforeſaid; uphold it not againſt the Lord, for if you do, you ſhall never be eſtabliſhed;</hi> and this is from the Mouth of my Lord unto you.</p>
                  <p>And laſt of all, My Maſter hath a People in this Nation, even a ſuffering People, that have born the Burden of the Cruelty and Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and Wickedneſs both of Rulers and Teachers, who have, as it were, trodden them down, and made them a very Prey to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring Mouths; the very Cry of their Sufferings hath reached unto Heaven, and the very Sound thereof your Ears have heard; and this People are greatly <hi>beloved,</hi> and my Lord <hi>will aſſuredly honour them, and his Hand ſhall be continued to preſerve them and defend them againſt all their Enemies whatſoever;</hi> and he doth reſerve them to himſelf, and for a glorious Work that he hath to do by them; and he hath formed them for himſelf, and they cannot join with any of the Horns of the Great B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

while this People are held in Bondage; and their Sufferings are deeply conſidered of the Lord, and the Seaſon thereof is expiring towards an End; and when this cometh to paſs, then Woe unto the Kingdom of Antichriſt, and to the Whore and falſe Prophet, even when their Strength is dried up, by which they have made War againſt the Lamb, and his Followers; yea, Woe unto them, great Fearfulneſs ſhall be upon all the World when the King of that People reigns upon the Earth, and the Time is at hand; bleſſed is the Man that waiteth for it, and bleſſed is he that is not offended in his Coming, but is prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him in his Appearing, which ſuddenly cometh upon all the World.</p>
                  <p>And thus I have told the Lord's preſent Meſſage unto you, which I received from him, and thus far I am clear; and whether you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it, or reject it, my Peace and Reward is for ever with him, who am a Subject of his Kingdom, and a Friend to this Nation, however otherwiſe judged by ignorant Men.</p>

               <note place="margin">His cruel and unrighteous Sentence, and Treatment.</note> to this Effect, <hi>That he was to work two Years at the Wheel-barrow with a</hi> Negro, <hi>or pay or cauſe to be paid Six hundred Guilders.</hi> To this he attempted to make his Defence in a ſober Way, but was not ſuffered to ſpeak, and ſent to the Dungeon again; where no <hi>Engliſh</hi> were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to come to him. After ſome Days he was taken out, and pinion'd and being ſet with his Face towards the Court-chamber, his Hat was taken off, and another Sentence read to him in <hi>Dutch,</hi> which he did not underſtand: But that it diſpleaſed many of that Nation, did appear by the Shaking of their Heads. Then he was caſt again into the Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, where he was kept ſome Days. At length betimes in a Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he was haled out, and chained to a Wheel-barrow, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to work: To which he anſwered, <hi>He was never brought up, nor uſed to ſuch a Work.</hi>

Then they took him up again, and cauſed the Negro to beat him with the ſaid Rope, until he fell down the ſecond Time, and it was believed that he received about one Hundred Blows. Thus he was kept all that Day in the Heat of the Sun, chained to the Wheel-barrow; and his Body being much bruiſed and ſwelled with the Blows, and he kept without Food, grew very faint, and ſate upon the Ground, with his Mind retired to the Lord, and reſigned to his Will, whereby he felt himſelf ſupported. At Night he was lock'd up again in the Dungeon; and the next Morning he was chain'd again to the Wheel-barrow, and a Sentinel ſet over him, that none might come ſo much as to ſpeak with him. On the third Day he was had forth, and chained in like Manner; and no Wonder that he ſtill refuſed to work; for beſides the Unreaſonableneſs of requiring ſuch a ſervile Work of him who had committed no Evil, he was not in a Condition to perform it, being made altogether unable by the cruel Blows given him. In this weak State he was brought before the Governour, who demanded him <hi>to work; otherwiſe,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>He ſhould be whipt every Day. Robert</hi> ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, <hi>What Law he had broken? and called for his Accuſers, that he might know his Tranſgreſſion.</hi> But inſtead of an Anſwer, he was chained to the Wheel-barrow again, and threaten'd, that <hi>If he ſpoke to any one, he ſhould be puniſhed worſe.</hi> Yet he did not forbear to ſpeak to ſome that came to him, ſo as he ſaw meet, and thought convenient. Then ſeeing

they could not keep him ſilent, they put him into the Dungeon again, and kept him cloſe there ſeveral Days, and two Nights, one Day and a half of it, without Bread or Water. After this he was brought very early in the Morning into a private Room,<note place="margin">He is hung up by up Hands and whipt.</note> and ſtript to the Waſte, and hung up by his Hands, and a great Leg of Wood tied to his Feet, ſo that he could not turn his Body, and then a ſtrong Negro was ſet to whip him with Rods; who laid many Stripes upon him, which cut his Fleſh ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much. Then he was let down again, and put into the Dungeon as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and none ſuffered to come to him. Two Days after, he was had forth again, and hung up as before, and many more Stripes were laid upon him by another Negro. He almoſt fainting, and not knowing but his Life might be taken away, deſired that ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> might be ſuffered to come to him: Which was granted, and an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woman came, and waſhed his Stripes, finding him brought ſo low, that ſhe thought he would not live till the next Morning. And ſhe telling this to her Husband, it made ſuch an Impreſſion upon him, that he went to the Fiſcal, and prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him a fat Ox, to ſuffer <hi>Robert</hi> to be at his Houſe until he was well again. But the Fiſcal would not permit this, unleſs the whole Fine was paid. And tho' <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

So, in Obedience to the living God, I made Preparation to paſs to <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> in the 4th Month, 1658.

                  <p>WHEREAS I am by many charged with the Guiltineſs of my own Blood; if you mean in my coming to <hi>Boſton,</hi> I am there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in clear, and juſtified by the Lord, in whoſe Will I came, who will require my Blood of you, be ſure, who have made a Law to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Lives of the innocent Servants of God, if they come among you, who are called by you, <hi>Curſed Quakers;</hi> altho' I ſay, and am a living Witneſſ for them and the Lord, that he hath bleſſed them, and ſent them unto you; therefore be not found Fighters againſt God, but let my Counſel and Requeſt be accepted with you, To repeal all ſuch Laws, that the Truth and Servants of the Lord may have free Paſſage among you, and you be kept from ſhedding innocent Blood, which I know there are many among you would not do, if they knew

it ſo to be; nor can the Enemy that ſtirreth you up thus to deſtroy this holy Seed, in any Meaſure countervail the great Damage that you will, by thus doing, procure. Therefore ſeeing the Lord hath not hid it from me, it lieth upon me, in Love to your Souls, thus to perſwade you. I have no Self-ends, the Lord knoweth; for if my Life were freely granted by you, it would not avail me, nor could I expect it of you, ſo long as I ſhould daily hear or ſee the Sufferings of theſe People, my dear Brethren, and the Seed, with whom my Life is bound up, as I have done theſe two Years; and now it is like to encreaſe, even unto Death, for no evil Doing, but coming among you. Was ever the like Laws heard of among a People that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs Chriſt come in the Fleſh? And have ſuch no other Weapons but ſuch Laws to fight againſt ſpiritual Wickedneſs withal, as you call it? Woe is me for you? Of whom take ye Counſel? Search with the Light of Chriſt in you, and it will ſhew you of whom, as it hath done me and many more, who have been diſobedient and deceived, as now ye are: Which Light as you come into, and obeying what is made manifeſt to you therein, you will not repent that you were kept from ſhedding Blood, tho' it were by a Woman. It is not mine own Life I ſeek, (for I chuſe rather to ſuffer with the People of God, than to enjoy the Pleaſures of <hi>Egypt)</hi> but the Life of the Seed, which I know the Lord hath bleſſed, and therefore ſeeks the Enemy thus vehemently to deſtroy the Life thereof, as in all Ages he ever did. O hearken not unto him, I beſeech you, for the Seed's-Sake, which is one in all, and is dear in the Sight of God, which they that touch, touch the Apple of his Eye, and cannot eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape his Wrath; whereof I having felt, cannot but perſuade all Men that I have to do withal, eſpecially you who name the Name of Chriſt, to depart from ſuch Iniquity, as <hi>ſhedding Blood, even of the Saints of the Moſt High,</hi> Therefore let my Requeſt have as much Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with you, if you be Chriſtians, as <hi>Eſther's</hi> had with <hi>Ahaſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> whoſe Relation is ſhort of That that's between Chriſtians; and my Requeſt is the ſame that hers was: And he ſaid not, that he had made a Law, and that it would be diſhonourable for him to revoke it; but when he underſtood that thoſe People were ſo prized by her, and ſo nearly concerned her, as in Truth theſe are to me, you may ſee what he did for her. Therefore I leave theſe Lines with you, appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the faithful and true Witneſs of God, which is one in all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, before whom we muſt all appear; with whom I ſhall eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſt, in everlaſting Joy and Peace, whether you will hear or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear. With him is my Reward, with whom to live is my Joy, and to die is my Gain, tho' I had not had your Forty eight Hours Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for the Preparation of the Death of <hi>Mary Dyar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And know this alſo, that if thro' the Enmity you ſhall declare your ſelves worſe than <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> and confirm your Law, tho' it were but by taking away the Life of one of us, that the Lord will overthrow both your Law and you, by his righteous Judgments and Plagues poured juſtly upon you, who now whilſt ye are warned thereof, and tenderly ſought unto, may avoid the one, by removing the other. If you neither hear, nor obey the Lord nor his Servants, yet will he ſend more of his Servants among you, ſo that your End ſhall be fruſtrated, that think to reſtrain them ye call <hi>curſed Quakers,</hi> from coming among you by any Thing you can do to them. Yea, verily, he hath a Seed here among you, for whom we have ſuffered all this while, and yet ſuffer; whom the Lord of the Harveſt will ſend forth more Labourers to gather, out of the Mouths of the Devourers of all Sorts, into his Fold, where he will lead them into freſh Paſtures, even the

Oh, let none of you put this good Day far from you, which verily in the Light of the Lord I ſee approaching, even to many in and about <hi>Boſton</hi> which is the bittereſt and darkeſt profeſſing Place, and ſo to continue ſo long as you have done, that ever I heard of. Let the Time paſt therefore ſuffice, for ſuch a Profeſſion as brings forth ſuch Fruits as theſe Laws are. In Love and in the Spirit of Meekneſs, I again beſeech you, for I have no Enmity to the Perſons of any; but you ſhall know, that God will not be mocked; but what ye ſow, that ſhall ye reap from him, that will render to every one according to the Deeds done in the Body, whether Good or Evil. Even ſo be it, ſaith</p>

               <hi>A Copy of this was given to the general Court after</hi> Mary Dyar <hi>had received Sentence of Death, about the</hi> 8th <hi>or</hi> 9th <hi>Month,</hi> 1659.</p>
            <p>The Day appointed to execute the bloody Sentence,<note place="margin">They are led under a Guard to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution.</note> was the 27th of <hi>October,</hi> when in the Afternoon, the condemned Priſoners were led to the Gallows by the Marſhal <hi>Michaelſon,</hi> and Captain <hi>James Oliver,</hi> with a Band of about two hundred armed Men, beſides many Horſemen; as if they were afraid that ſome of the People would have reſcu'd the Priſoners: And that no Actors on the Stage might be wanting, the Prieſt <hi>Wilſon</hi> joined to the Company, who, when the Court deliberated how to deal with the <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſaid, <hi>Hang them,</hi> or elſe (drawing his Finger athwart his Throat) as if he would have ſaid, <hi>diſpatch them this Way.</hi> Now the March began, and a Drummer going next before the Condemned, the Drums were beaten, eſpecially when any of them at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to ſpeak. Glorious Signs of heavenly Joy and Gladneſs were beheld in the Countenances of theſe three Perſons, who walked Hand in Hand,<hi>Mary</hi> being the middlemoſt, which made the Marſhal ſay to her, who was pretty aged, and ſtricken in Years, <hi>Are not you aſhamed to walk thus Hand in Hand between two Young Men? No,</hi> replied the, <hi>This is to me an Hour of the greateſt Joy I could enjoy in this World. No Eye can ſee, no Ear can hear, no Tongue can utter, and no Heart can underſtood the ſweet Incomes, or Influence, and the Refreſhings of the Spirit of the Lord, which now I feel.</hi> Thus going along, <hi>W. Robinſon</hi> ſaid, <hi>This is your Hour, and the Power of Darkneſs.</hi> But preſently the Drums were beaten; yet ſhortly after, the Drummers leaving off beating, <hi>Marmaduke Stevenſon</hi> ſaid, <hi>This is the Day of your Viſitation, wherein the Lord hath viſited you.</hi> More he ſpoke, but could not be underſtood, by reaſon of the Drums being beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en again. Yet they went on with great Chearfulneſs, as going to an everlaſting Wedding-Feaſt, and rejoicing that the Lord had counted them worthy to ſuffer Death for his Name's Sake. When they were come near the Gallows, the Prieſt ſaid in a taunting Way to <hi>W. Robinſon, Shall ſuch Jacks as you come in before Authority with their Hats on?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prieſt Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's repreach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Queſtion.</note> To which <hi>Robinſon</hi> reply'd, <hi>Mind you, mind you, It is for the not putting off the Hat we are put to Death!</hi> Now being come to the Ladder, they took Leave of each other with tender Embraces, and then <hi>Robinſon</hi> went chearfully up the Ladder, and being got up, ſaid to the People,<hi>This is the Day of your Viſitation, wherein the Lord hath viſited you: This is the Day the Lord is riſen in his mighty Power, to be avenged on all his Adverſaries.</hi> He alſo ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified that <hi>he ſuffered not as an Evil-doer;</hi> and deſired the Spectators, <hi>to mind the Light that was in them, to wit, the Light of Chriſt, of which he te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, and was now going to ſeal it with his Blood.</hi> This ſo incenſed the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Prieſt, that he ſaid, <hi>Hold thy Tongue, be ſilent; thou art going to die with a Lie in thy Mouth.</hi> The Rope being now about his Neck, the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner bound his Hands and Legs, and tied his Neckcloth about his Face: Which being done,<hi>Robinſon</hi> ſaid, <hi>Now ye are made manifeſt;</hi> and

the Executioner being about turning him off, he ſaid, <hi>I ſuffer for Chriſt in whom I live, and for whom I die.</hi> He being turned off, <hi>Marmaduke Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venſon</hi> ſtept up the Ladder, and ſaid,<note place="margin">Robinſon's <hi>Laſt Words. As alſo</hi> Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venſon's</note> 
               <hi>Be it known unto all this Day, that we ſuffer not as Evil-doers, but for Conſcience-ſake.</hi> And when the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was about to turn him off, he ſaid, <hi>This Day ſhall we be at Reſt with the Lord:</hi> And ſo he was turned off. And <hi>Mary Dyar</hi>ſeeing now her Companions hanging dead before her, alſo ſtept up the Ladder; but after her Coats were tied about her Feet, the Halter put about her Neck, and her Face covered with a Handkerchief, which the Prieſt <hi>Wilſon</hi> lent the Hangman, juſt as ſhe was to be turned off, a Cry was heard, <hi>Stop, for ſhe is reprieved.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mary Dyar reprieved</note> Her Feet then being looſed, they bad her come down. But ſhe, whoſe Mind was already as it were in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſtood ſtill, and ſaid, <hi>She was there willing to ſuffer as her Brethren did, unleſs they would annul their wicked Law.</hi> Little Heed was given to what ſhe ſaid, but they pulled her down, and the Marſhal and others taking her by the Arms, carried her to Priſon again. That ſhe thus was freed of the Gallows this Time, was at the Interceſſion of her Son, to whom it ſeems they could not then reſolve to deny that Favour.<note place="margin">She writes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the Court of Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</note> She now having heard why ſhe was reprieved, wrote the next Day, being the 28th of <hi>October,</hi> the following Letter to the Court.</p>

                  <p>ALL theſe Overturnings, and almoſt wonderful Changings were effected thro' the Juſtice of the Lord's Hand— You are now again at the Stern of Government, and on the Throne; and I dare not but ſay, it is of and by the Lord, and that he hath done it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Expectations of many; and what his End is in it, remains with him. But I am ſure one Cauſe is, that you may execute Part of his Wrath upon that treacherous Generation of hypocritical and deceitful Men, ſome of the Army I mean.— I need not ſay to you, how that many of them were raiſed up from a low Eſtate; and inſtead of ſerving the Nation, became their Lords and Oppreſſors: They have abuſed the Lord's Mercy to them, and exalted themſelves, and become as great Oppreſſors, and as grievous to the Nation, as ever they were that went before them; and ſome of them took the very Titles and Eſtates or their Enemie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and followed their evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit alſo, tho' the Lord was long-ſuffering to them, and gave them a <hi>Day,</hi> and put Opportunity into their Hands, wherein they might have done Good; but they alſo neglected to ſerve God and the Nation, to ſerve themſelves; and becauſe of the Ambition and Pride of ſome of them, the Lord ſuffered them to make this laſt Interruption upon you, which was great <hi>Treachery</hi> in Man's Account, that thereby their Meaſure might be filled up, and that he might give you Occaſion againſt them, and ſuffer you to be filled with Indignation towards them, to break them to Pieces: And what you do to ſome of them, in caſting them out, and afflicting them, you are but God's Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners therein; you are the Executioners of his Anger, in what you do to them; and who ſhall prevent you, or forbid you to go on? For they have long enough diſſembled with this Nation, in profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing more than others, and doing leſs; and their <hi>Downfal</hi> is now. And God hath looked upon you to be hard-hearted and cruel enough, and very fit Executioners of Vengeance upon ſuch Men, as I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
                  <p>But now concerning you, and your preſent State, as you are in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Place and Power, I have ſomething to ſay to you; tho they are fallen, and you yet ſtand, and you have a little Time after them; but this I ſay, do not glory over their <hi>Fall,</hi> neither glory as tho' you ſhould ſtand for ever; for they were not greater Sinners than you are, neither are you one whit more righteous than ſome of them; but you are as ſure to fall, as they are fallen, with no leſs Meaſure of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour and Affliction than is come upon them; and you are in your laſt Hour; and I dare not ſay, that God expects much more from you, than for the End aforeſaid <hi>(viz) To be the Executioners of Justice upon Men as ſinful as your ſelves:</hi> So do not glory over them that are fallen; but know that your Time alſo is but ſhort, and your Fall may prove to your Deſtruction, and theirs may prove to make them hotter, and refine them: And if God hath choſen you to execute ſome Part of his Wrath upon them, for their <hi>Wickedneſs,</hi> he will doubtleſs find Inſtruments to execute his Wrath upon you, elſe he will do it with his own Hand; for he purpoſeth not to ſpare you; for your Sins <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And the Children of <hi>Zion</hi> they truſt in the living God, and fear not the Terror of migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Men, neither can they be afraid at the Roaring of the Sea, nor at the preſent Threatning of the Heathen; for God is with them. And I ſay unto you, the Servant of the Lord hath ponder'd and conſider'd all theſe proceedings, and viewed the preſent State of Things at this Day, and there is no Viſion from God unto you of Peace and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, nor of a happy and laſting Government, as you now ſtand. If any Prophet ſhall divine this unto you, he ſpeaks what he hath not from the Lord, but the Viſion of his own Heart, and he deceives you and himſelf; for you are not eſtabliſhed upon a right Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, neither are you acted by a right Spirit, which can truly govern for God; but the Spirit of Wrath and Fury is put into you, for the Work which you are called. And I know not how to warn you that you do not perſecute the People of God: <hi>For why?</hi> It may be you muſt fill up your Meaſure of Wickedneſs thereby, that God may break you perpetually; yet the leſs will be your Judgment, if you do it not: But and if you do it, the Lord will take Occaſion againſt you, to wound you, and you ſhall never be healed; and as you do afflict others, ſo and much more ſhall it be done unto you from the Lord. Wherefore conſider what I have ſaid; for this is the Viſion of the Almighty unto you, that ſhall not go unfulſilled: And what you do, you muſt do it quickly; for your Time is ſhort, and your Power will God ſubdue; and his Kingdom and Power will he ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exalt over your Heads, and make you and the Nations know, that he is God, and that all Power is with him, and that he can do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he will; and it is his Right alone to reign, and his Childrens Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whilſt he was in <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wal,</hi> there were great Shipwrecks about the Land's End. Now it was the Cuſtom of that Country, that at ſuch Times both Rich and Poor went out to get as much of the Wreck as they could, not caring to ſave the People's Lives; and this Cuſtom ſo prevailed, that in ſome Parts of the Country they called Shipwrecks, <hi>God's Grace.</hi> This grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>G. Fox</hi> not a little, conſidering how far theſe profeſſed Chriſtians were below the Heathen at <hi>Melita,</hi> who courteouſly received <hi>Paul,</hi> and the others that had ſuffered Shipwreck with him, and made him a Fire. On this Conſideration, he was moved to write a Paper to the Magiſtrates, Prieſts, and others, both high and low; in which he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them <q>The Wickedneſs of their Deeds, and reproved them for ſuch greedy Actions, telling them how they were ready to fight with one another for the Spoil, and ſpend what they got in Taverns or Ale-houſes, letting thoſe that eſcaped drowning, go a begging up and down the Country. Therefore he ſeriouſly exhorted them, to do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others, what they would have done to themſelves.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Paper he ſent to all the Pariſhes thereabouts.<note place="margin">Several emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent People in <hi>Cornwal</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by <hi>G.

Fox</hi> deſired them to go alſo to the Colonel that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Soldiers, and to acquaint him of their rude Carriage, and how they diſturbed the Meetings. But the aforeſaid four Perſons were backward to go to him. Next Morning being the firſt Day of the Week, a Meeting was kept in an Orchard, where many People came; and after <hi>G. Fox</hi> had been preaching a pretty while, there came ſeveral rude Soldiers, ſome with drawn Swords, and ſome drunk, and among theſe one that had bound himſelf with an Oath, <hi>To cut down, and kill the Man that ſpoke.</hi> But when he came preſſing in thro' the Crowd, and was within two Yards of <hi>G. Fox,</hi> he ſtopp'd at thoſe four Perſons before mentioned, and fell a jangling with them; but at length his Sword was put up again. The next Day they went and ſpoke with the Colonel; and he having heard how miſchievous his Soldiers had been, ſent for them, and cut and ſlaſh'd ſome of them. When this was told <hi>G. Fox,</hi> he blamed thoſe his Friends, thinking they might have prevented the cutting of the Soldiers, if they had gone to the Colonel when he would have had them. Yet this had ſuch Effect, that the Meeting there was kept without Diſturbance a good while after.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>G. Fox</hi> then alſo had a general Meeting at <hi>Edward Pyot</hi>'s near <hi>Briſtol,</hi> at which were ſeveral Thouſands of People, and ſo many of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> that ſome ſaid, <hi>The City look'd naked:</hi> And all was quiet.</p>
            <p>But in other Places about this Time Things were not ſo quiet; for the Soldiers under General <hi>Monk</hi>'s Command, were often very rude in diſturbing of Meetings.

The Original of this Declaration was ſent to the Houſe of Lords, and a Duplicate in a Letter to the Houſe of Commons, and repeated and ſent in a Letter to General <hi>Monk,</hi> the Council of State, and the Officers of the Army. Hereupon it was reſolved by the Parliament to prepare an Anſwer; and both in the Houſe of Lords, and in the Houſe of Commons, It was voted to proclaim King <hi>Charles</hi> at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and in <hi>London,</hi> as lawful Sovereign of his Kingdoms,<note place="margin">Is proclaimed King.</note> which was done on the 8th of the Month called <hi>May.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the King, who by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> was invited to return to <hi>Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,</hi> and by the <hi>French</hi> to come to <hi>Calais,</hi> choſe, at the preſſing Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the States General of the United Provinces to go by <hi>Holland;</hi> and ſo he went with the Yachts of the States to <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> and from thence with Coaches to the <hi>Hague,</hi> where having ſtaid ſome Days, he took Shipping at <hi>Schevelighen</hi> for <hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">And from <hi>Holland</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and comes to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> on the Anniversary of his Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</note> and made his Entry at <hi>London</hi> on the Anniverſary of his Birth-Day. Thus we ſee <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, who not long after was crown'd, reſtored not by the Sword, but by the marvellous Hand of the Lord.</p>
            <p>About this Time <hi>George Fox</hi> the Younger came to <hi>Harwich,</hi> where he was haled out of a Meeting, and impriſoned under a Pretence of having cauſed a Tumult. But to give to the Reader a true Sight of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I muſt go back a little.</p>
            <p>About four Years before this Time,<note place="margin">The Story at large of <hi>G.F.</hi> jun. being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned at <hi>Harwich</hi> on pretence of a tumult.</note> ſome of the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> being come into the ſaid Town, one of them ſpoke a few Words by way of Exhortation to the People that came from the Steeple-houſe; and paſſing on, he and thoſe with him went to an Inn. The Mayor hearing thereof, ſent to them, commanding that they ſhould depart the Town, which they did after a ſhort Space; but about Night they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned and lodg'd as their Inn; and the next Day paſſed away peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably. Not long after, the Woman that kept the Inn, was commanded to come before the Magiſtrates, who threatned to take away her Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, unleſs ſhe promiſed to lodge no more ſuch Perſons. But how eager ſoever they were for keeping out the <hi>Quakers,</hi> yet it proved ineffectual; for it ſeems ſome of thoſe that had been ſpoken to in the Streets, were ſo reached, that they came to be obedient to the inward Teachings of the Lord they had been recommended to. And ſo a Way was made for Meetings there, whereby the Number of thoſe of that Society began to increaſe. And becauſe they could no longer comply with ſuperſtitious Burials, they bought a Piece of Ground to bury their Dead in, but met with great Oppoſition at their Burials; and once, when ſeveral came along to bury a Corps, it was by Force taken from them, and ſet by the Sea-ſide, where having lain above Ground Part of two Days and one Night, it was privately covered by ſome with ſmall Stones.</p>
            <p>In the Month called <hi>May, G. Fox</hi> the Younger came to <hi>Harwich,</hi> to preach the Truth there. The Mayor of the Town, whoſe Name was <hi>Miles Hubbard,</hi> having heard of this, ſtopt ſeveral that were going to the Meeting. The rude Multitude ſeeing it, grew inſolent, and made a hideous Noiſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The Officers then coming, the Mayor commanded the Conſtables to take the ſaid <hi>G.

Some time after <hi>G.

Fox</hi> was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Sheriff of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and his Men: Theſe went with him to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and upon the Road they met <hi>Graſſingham,</hi> who was coming from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Harwich,</hi> in Purſuance of an Order which he had received from the Commiſſioner of the Admiralty and Navy, for reſitting one of the King's Frigots. But notwithſtanding <hi>Graſſingham</hi> ſhewed his Order to the Sheriff,<note place="margin">Are both committed to the Sergeant at Arms, and write to the Houſe of Commons..</note> yet he brought him back to <hi>London</hi> with <hi>Fox,</hi> and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them into the Cuſtody of the Sergeant at Arms, attending the Houſe, who committed them to <hi>Lambeth-Houſe.</hi> They having been there about three Weeks, wrote a Letter to the Houſe of Commons, wherein they gave ſome Account of the Manner of their Impriſonment, and deſired, <q>That they with their Accuſers might be brought Face to Face before the Parliament, ſaying, That if any thing could be proved againſt them, worthy of Puniſhment, they ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it. But they thought it to be unjuſt and unreaſonable, that only one ſhould be haled out of a peaceable Meeting, and ſent to Priſon, without being examined, only for declaring againſt the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and the Wickedneſs of the rude People, and againſt ſuch as ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſuch Ungodlineſs, and did not ſeek to ſuppreſs it.</q>

            <p>This was the chief Contents of their Paper, which they incloſed in a Letter to the Speaker of the Houſe of Commons in theſe Words:</p>

            <p>Shortly after this Order was iſſued forth,<note place="margin">Who are yet a good while de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for their Fees.</note> the Sergeant at Arms ſent his Clerk to demand Fees and Chamber-Rent of the Priſoners, asking fifty Pounds for Fees, and ten Shillings a Week for Chamber-Rent. But ſince no Evil was laid to their Charge, they could not reſolve to ſatisfy this unreaſonable Demand, yet offered to pay two Shillings and Sixpence a Week, tho' the Chamber where they had lain, was the higheſt Room in a lofty Tower, and all the Windows open, until they had gotten them glazed, without any Charge to the Sergeant. Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſtanding thus, their Cauſe was referred to the King's Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. But it laſted yet a good while before they were releaſed; for ſeveral Evaſions were made uſe of to keep them in Cuſtody.</p>
            <p>Whilſt <hi>G. Fox</hi> was Priſoner,<note place="margin">Memorable Exhortations to K.<hi>Ch II.</hi> by <hi>G. F.</hi>
               </note> he wrote a little Book, which he call'd <hi>A Noble Salutation to King</hi> Charles Stuart. Wherein he ſhewed him how Matters had gone in <hi>England,</hi> viz. <q>That his Father's Party ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe that appeared in Arms againſt them becauſe of their Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for they were Tradeſmen, Ploughmen, Servants, and the like; which contemptible Inſtruments God made uſe of to bring down the Loftineſs of the others. But thoſe of the Parliament Party growing from Time to Time ſucceſsful and prevailing, got into the Poſſeſſions of thoſe they conquered, and fell into the ſame Pride and Oppreſſion which they had cried out againſt in others; and many of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came greater Oppreſſors and Perſecutors than the former had been.</q> Moreover, the Author exhorted the King to obſreve the Hand of the Lord in reſtoring of him. <hi>Therefore,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>let no Man deceive thee, by perſuading thee that theſe Things are thus brought to paſs, becauſe the
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:003104_0251_0FEFF5A5AC6E0218"/>
Kingdom was thy own proper Right, and becauſe it was witheld from thee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all Right; or becauſe that thoſe called Royaliſts are much more righteous than thoſe who are now fallen under Thee. For I plainly declare unto Thee, that this Kingdom, and all the Kingdoms of the Earth are properly the Lord's.—And this know, that it was the juſt Hand of God, in taking away tha Kingdom from thy Father and thee, and giving it unto others; and that alſo it is the juſt Hand of the Lord to take it again from them, and bring them under Thee; tho' I ſhall not ſay, but that ſome of them went beyond their Commiſſion againſt thy Father, when they were brought as a Rod over you; and well will it be for Thee, if Thou becomeſt not guilty of the ſame Tranſgreſſions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Author farther exhorts the King to conſider,<q>That his Station was not without Danger; becauſe of the Changeableneſs of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, a great Part of which were perfidious, ſince one while they had ſworn for a King and Parliament; and ſhortly after they ſwore againſt a King, ſingle Perſon, or Houſe of Lords; and afterwards again they ſwore for a ſingle Perſon. Some Time after, they cry'd up a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment again. And when <hi>0. Cromwel</hi> had turn d out the Parliament, and ſet up himſelf, then the Prieſts prayed for him, and aſſerted his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to be juſt; and when he died, they fawned upon his Son <hi>Richard,</hi> and blaſphemouſly termed his Father <hi>the Light of their Eyes, and the Breath of their Noſtrils;</hi> and they told him,<hi>that God had left him to carry on that glorious Work which his Father had begun.</hi> Nay, ſome Prieſts compared <hi>Oliver</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> to <hi>Joſhua, who ſhould carry them into the promiſed Land.</hi> Thus they continually would flatter thoſe that were at the Helm. For when <hi>George Booth</hi> made a Riſing, and they thought there would be a Turn, then ſome of the Prieſts cryed out againſt the Parliament, and curſed ſuch as would not go out againſt them. But when <hi>Booth</hi> was taken, then many began to petition the Parliament, and to excuſe themſelves, that they had no Hand in that Riſing.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Next the Author ſets forth the Wickedneſs of the People, <q>by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Drinking, and Drunkenneſs; thereby, as it were, to ſhew their Loyalty to the King: And he relates alſo, how having preached at <hi>Harwich,</hi> againſt the grievous Wickedneſs of the People, he was haled to Priſon in the King's Name. Finally he exhorts the King to take Heed of ſeeking Revenge; and to ſhew Mercy.</q>

            <p>This Paper,<note place="margin">Which were delivered to the King by <hi>R. H.</hi> and afterward printed. Divers Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries propoſed to the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly by the <hi>E.</hi> of <hi>C.</hi>
               </note> which was not a ſmall one, for it took up ſeveral Sheets, was delivered in Writing by <hi>Richard Hubberthorn,</hi> into the King's Hand at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and was not long after by the Author given forth in Print.</p>
            <p>Now one of the moſt eminent Royaliſts drew up divers Queries to the <hi>Quakers,</hi> deſiring them to anſwer to them, and to direct their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer with this Superſcription, <hi>Tradite hanc Amico Regis,</hi> that is, <hi>Deliver this to the King's Friend.</hi> For it was clearly ſeen, that ſeveral of their Predictions came to be fulfilled, of which thoſe of <hi>Edward Burroughs</hi> were not the leaſt. And therefore ſome (as it ſeems) thought that by the <hi>Quakers</hi> they might get ſome Knowledge whether any Stability of the King's Government was to be expected. By the Queries it appeared, that the Author of them was a Man of Underſtanding, and of ſome Moderation alſo; and tho' I don't know who he was, yet I am not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Thoughts that <hi>Edward</hi> Earl of <hi>Clarendon</hi> and High Chancellor, may have been the Penman thereof. The Tendency of theſe Queries chiefly was to know from the <hi>Quakers,</hi> 
               <q>What their Judgment was concerning the King's Right to the Crown; and whether they ever did foreſee his Return; and alſo whether they could judge that his Reign or Government ſhould be bleſſed or not. Moreover, whether he might juſtly forgive or avenge himſelf? And whether he might allow Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Conſcience to all Sorts of People,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anſwered by</hi> E. Burroughs.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>Edward Burroughs</hi> anſwered
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:003104_0252_0FEFF562475CF2E0"/>
theſe Queries, and publiſhed his Anſwer in Print. It was directed to the King and the Royaliſts. In it he ſhewed, <q>That in ſome of their Writings it had been ſignified, that they had ſome Expectations of the King's Reſtoration. That the King's coming to the Throne was reaſonable and equitable, becauſe thro' the Purpoſe of the Lord. That his Reign and Government might be bleſſed, or not bleſſed, according to his Carriage. And that he might juſtly forgive his and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Enemies; for tho' he and his Father might have been injured; yet foraſmuch as they had applyed to the Sword to determine their Controverſy with the Nation, the Sword went againſt them; and by that whereby they thought to ſtand, they did fall; and who then ſhould they blame for that which befel them, ſeeing the Sword which they themſelves did chuſe, deſtroyed them. However the Author ſignified, that this was not meant of the King's Death, that being quite another Caſe. And if ſuch, who had deſtroyed Kingly Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in Name and Title, and pretended to govern better, and did not make Reformation, but became Oppreſſors, having broke their Promiſes, came to be puniſhed on that Account with Death, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, ſuch could not be ſaid to ſuffer for a good Conſcience, nor for Righteouſneſs Sake; but it was becauſe they were Oppreſſors; and ſuffering for that Cauſe could not be called Perſecution.</q> 
               <hi>But none of us</hi> (thus ran <hi>Edward Burroughs</hi>'s Words) <hi>can ſuffer for that Cauſe, as not being guilty thereof. If we ſuffer in your Government, it is for the Name of Chriſt, becauſe nothing can be charged againſt us in this Capacity as we now ſtand, and in this State unto which we are now gathered and changed, nor in any Matter of Action or Rebellion againſt the King, nor his Father; nor in any Thing concerning the Law and Worſhip of our God, and the Matters of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and our pure Conſciences. And if any that are now amongſt us, were any Way engaged in the Parliament Service in the Wars, it was not in Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King or his Father, or that we ſought their Deſtruction, as Men; but upon ſober and reaſonable Principles, and not for corrupt Ends, nor to get Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Riches to our ſelves, as ſome others might do, who went into the War for ſelf Ends, and continued in Action, after the Cauſe which was once engaged for was utterly loſt. And that Principle, which ſome Time led ſome into Action to oppoſe Oppreſſion, and ſeek after Reformation, that Principle is ſtill juſtified, tho' we are now better informed than once we were. For tho' we do now more than ever oppoſe Oppreſſion, and ſeek after Reformation, yet we do it not in that Way of outward warring and fighting with carnal Weapons and Swords; and you ought to put a Difference between ſuch as ſome Time acted in the Wars againſt you, in and upon ſober and reaſonable Principles, and that did not make themſelves rich and high in the World, thro' your Sufferings, and between ſuch as have acted againſt you for Sef-Ends, and have inſulted over you, and have made themſelves great and rich in this World thro' your Afflictions and Sufferings.</hi> To the Query, <q>Whether the great Afflictions ſuſtained by the King divers Years, from Subjects of his own Nation, and the Guilt thereof, did lie upon all the Subjects in general? Or whether upon any, or ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Sorts of People, who were ſuch more than others?</q> 
               <hi>E. Burroughs</hi> made this Anſwer, <hi>So far as his Sufferings were unjuſt, the Guilt thereof doth not lie upon all the Subjects in general, but upon ſome more than others; and ſuch are eaſy to be diſtinguiſhed from others, if it be conſidered who they are that raiſed the War in this Nation, againſt the King, and who firſt preached and prayed up the War, and proſecuted it againſt the King's Father, and who caſt out the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Prelates from their Places, and took their Revenues and Benefices, and are become Men as corrupted, as covetous and ſelf-ſeeking, as proud and ambitious, as unjuſt Perſecutors, as even the Men were which they caſt out: And who it is that hath gotten great Eſtates in the Nation, and worldly Honour, and raiſed themſelves from nothing by the Wars, and by your Suffering; and
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:003104_0253_0FEFF5A930DA06F8"/>
who got the Eſtates and Titles of their Enemies, and pretended to free them from all Oppreſſions, but have not done it, but have continued the old Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and have been ſtriving among themſelves who ſhould rule, and who ſhould be great.mdash;And as for us, who are called</hi> Quakers, <hi>we are clear from the Guilt of all the King's Sufferings. We have not caſt out others, and taken their Places of great B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nefices, neither have we made War with carnal Weapons againſt any, never ſince we were a People. Neither have we broken Oaths and Engagements, nor promiſed Freedom and Deliverance, and for Self-Ends and earthly Riches betrayed as others, have done. And in many Particulars it doth appear, that we are clear from his Sufferings, for we have been a ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing People as well as they, by the ſame Spirit which cauſed them to ſuffer, which hath been much more cruel, wicked, and unjuſt towards us, than it hath been to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, tho' our Perſecution hath been in another Manner. But what they have done againſt us, we can freely forgive them, and would have you to follow the ſame Example. For if you could accuſe them in many Things, ſo could we: But this is not a Time to accuſe one another, but to forgive one another, and ſo to overcome your Enemies. When they had gotten the Victory, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> did not reform, but became Oppreſſors, as well as others, and became cruel towards others, that would not ſay and do as they: And for this Cauſe the Lord hath brought them down, and may juſtly ſuffer others to deal with them as they have dealt with others. Yet notwithſtanding I muſt ſtill ſay, and it is my Judgment, that there was very great Oppreſſion and Vexation under the Government of the late King, and Biſhops under his Power, which the Lord was offended with, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good People oppreſſed by; for which Cauſe the Lord might and did juſtly raiſe up ſome to oppoſe, and ſtrive againſt Oppreſſions and Injuſtice, and to preſs after Reformation in all Things. This Principle of Sincerity, which in ſome Things carried them on in oppoſing Oppreſſions, and preſſing after Reformation, I can never deny, but acknowledge it; tho' many have loſt it, and became Self-Seekers, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting the Cauſe pretended to,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This is but a ſmall Part of the Queries and the Anſwers thereunto, which <hi>E. Burroughs</hi> concluded with a bold Exhortation to the King, to fear and reverence the Lord.</p>
            <p>Now we return again to <hi>G. Fox</hi> the Elder,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>G.

A Troop of Horſe comes from <hi>York</hi> to diſperſe them, but the Capt. tho' a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Man, gives them but little Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance.</note> whom we left about <hi>Briſtol;</hi> from whence he paſt to <hi>Gloceſter, Worceſter, Drayton,</hi> (the Place of his Nativity) and <hi>Yorkſhire.</hi> In that Country, at that Time, a year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Meeting was kept at <hi>Balby,</hi> in an Orchard, where ſome Thouſands of People were met together. At <hi>York,</hi> about thirty Miles off, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice being given of this Meeting, a Troop of Horſe came from thence; and when <hi>G. Fox</hi> ſtood preaching in the Meeting on the Stool, two Trumpeters came riding up, ſounding their Trumpets pretty near him: And then the Captain bid him, <hi>Come down, for he was come,</hi> he ſaid,<hi>to diſperſe the Meeting. G. Fox,</hi> then ſpeaking told him,<hi>He knew they were peaceable People:</hi> 
               <q>But if he did queſtion that they met in an hoſtile Manner, he might make Search among them; and if he found ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sword or Piſtol about any there, ſuch might ſuffer:</q> But the Captain told <hi>G. Fox, He muſt ſee them diſperſed, for he came all Night oh purpoſe to diſperſe them. G. Fox</hi> ask'd him, <q>What Honour it would be to him to ride with Swords and Piſtols amongſt ſo many unarmed Men and Women; But if he would be ſtill and quiet, the Meeting probably might not continue above two or three Hours: And when it was done, as they came peaceably, ſo they ſhould part: For he might perceive, the Meeting was ſo large, that all the Country thereabouts could not entertain them, but that they intended to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part towards their Homes at Night.</q> But the Captain ſaid, <hi>He could, not ſtay ſo long. G. Fox</hi> deſired then, that if he himſelf could not ſtay to ſee the Meeting ended, he would let a Dozen of his Soldiers ſtay. To this the Captain ſaid, <hi>He would permit them an Hour's Time;</hi> ſo he
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:003104_0254_0FEFF56543C2D848"/>
left ſix Soldiers to ſtay there, and then went away with his Troop: He being gone, the Soldiers that were left, told thoſe that were met together, <hi>They might ſtay till Night, if they would.</hi> This they were not for, but parted about three Hours after, without any Diſturbance. But if the Soldiers had been of ſuch a Temper as their Captain, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Meeting ſhould not have ended thus quietly: For he was a deſperate Man, having once told <hi>G. Fox</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> That <hi>he would obey his Superior s Command; and if it were to crucify Chriſt,</hi> he would do it; or <hi>execute the great Turk's Commands againſt the Chriſtians, if he were under him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>G. Fox</hi> went to <hi>Skipton,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>G.

For many of his Friends ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered much, and their Goods being taken from them, and ſome brought to Poverty, there was a Neceſſity to provide for them. This Meeting had ſtood ſeveral Years; for when the Juſtices and Captains came to break it up, and ſaw the Books and Accounts of Collections for Relief of the Poor, and how Care was taken that one County ſhould help ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and provide for the Poor, they commended ſuch Practice, and paſs'd away in Love.

            </p>

After he was in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, a Copy of his Mittimus was demanded; which ought not to be denied to any Priſoner, that ſo he may ſee what is laid to his Charge: But it was denied him; a Copy he could not have: Only they were ſuffered to read it over. And every Thing that was there charged againſt him, was utterly falſe; he was not guilty of any one Charge in it; as will be proved, and manifeſted to the Nation. So let the Governors conſider of it. I am concerned in this Thing, inaſmuch as he was apprehended in my Houſe; and if he be guilty, I am ſo too. So I deſire to have this ſearched out.</p>

               <p>Since the Lord hath called us, and gathered us to be a People, to walk in his Fear, and in his Truth, we have always ſuffered and been perſecutcd by the Powers that have ruled, and been made a Prey of, for departing from Iniquity; and when the Breach of no juſt Law could be charged aguinſt us, then they made Laws on Purpoſe to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Yes it is manifeſt, and we have ſeen it by Experience; and it is ſo common amongſt Men to ſwear and engage either for, or againſt Things, that there is no Regard taken to them, nor Fear of an Oath; that therefore which we ſpeak of in the Truth of our Hearts, is more than what they ſwear.</p>

               <p>Yes, what we do affirm, we can promiſe before the Lord, and take him to our Witneſs in it; but our ſo promiſing hath not been accepted, but the Ceremony of an Oath they have ſtood for, without which all other Things were accounted of no Effect.</p>

               <p>Our Principle is this, That <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is the true Light which enlightneth every one that cometh into the World, that all Men thro' him might believe;</hi> and that they were to obey and follow this Light, as they have received it, whereby they may be led unto God, and unto Righteouſneſs, and the Knowledge of the Truth, that they may be ſaved.</p>

               <p>As for the Word <hi>Sacrament,</hi> I do not read of it in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but as for the Body and Blood of Chriſt, I own, that there is no Remiſſion without Blood.</p>

            </sp>

               <p>Another of them ſaid, <hi>If they be the Bread, then they muſt be broken.</hi>

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Affairs in</hi> England.</note> where the Government now was quite altered. Many of the late King's Judges were now hanged and quartered: Among thoſe was alſo Colonel <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Hacker,</hi>

It was in the Night when theſe People made a Riſing; which cauſed ſuch a Stir, that the King's Soldiers ſounded an Alarm by the beating of Drums. The Train'd-bands appeared in Arms, and all was as in an Uproar, and both the Mob and Soldiers committed great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolences, for ſeveral Days; ſo that the <hi>Quakers,</hi> tho' altogether innocent, became the Object of the Fury of their Enemies, and many were haled to Priſon out of their peaceable Meetings.<note place="margin">

Early in the Morning there came a Company of Foot to the Houſe; and one of them drawing his Sword, held it over <hi>G.

As he was going out, he ſaw ſeveral of his Friends going to the Meeting, it being then the firſt Day of the Week; and he intended to have gone thither himſelf, if he had not been ſtopp'd; but now it being out of his Power to keep them Company, he commended their Boldneſs, and encouraged them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere therein. When he was come to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> ſeeing the Soldiers and People were exceeding rude, he began to exhort them to Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But ſome great Perſons coming by, who were envious to him, ſaid, <hi>What, do ye let him preach? Put him into ſuch a Place, where he may not ſtir.</hi> So he was put into that Place, and the Soldiers watched over him: But <hi>G. Fox</hi> told them, <hi>Tho' they could confine his Body, and ſhut that up, yet the Word of Life they could not ſtop.</hi> Some then asked him, <hi>What

But notwithſtanding this, ſo much was heard of the Numbers of the Impriſoned, that <hi>Margaret Fell</hi> went a ſecond Time to the King and Council, and acquainted them of the grievous Sufferings of Her Friends. <hi>G. Fox</hi> then writ a Letter of Conſolation to his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Friends; and alſo publiſhed in print a Declaration againſt all Sedition, Plotters and Fighters, wherein he manifeſted, that they were an harmleſs People, that denied Wars and Fightings, and could not make uſe of the outward Sword, or other carnal Weapons. This Declaration was preſented to the King and his Council and was of ſuch Effect, that the King gave forth a Proclamation, <hi>That no Soldiers ſhould go to ſearch any Houſe but with a Conſtable.</hi> When afterwards ſome of the Fifth Monarchy-men were put to Death becauſe of their Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, they did the <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſo called, that Right, that they clear'd them openly from having an Hand in, or Knowledge of their Plot. This and other Evidences cauſed the King, being continually impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned thereunto, to iſſue forth a Declaration, <hi>That the</hi> Quakers <hi>ſhould be ſet at Liberty without paying Fees.</hi> Many of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Preachers now temporized, and for keeping their Benefices, join'd with the Epiſcopalians; and did not ſtick to put on the Surplice. But this gave Occaſion to many of their Hearers to leave them, and join with the <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſo called, who could not comply with the Times. Others, who were a little more ſtedfaſt, made uſe of their Money to get Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,<note place="margin">Others pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, who in <hi>Oliver</hi>'s time would permit none.</note> tho' under the Government of <hi>Cromwel</hi> they would permit no Liberty of Conſcience to others; inſomuch that one <hi>Hewes,</hi> an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Prieſt at <hi>Plymouth in Oliver</hi>'s Days, when ſome Liberty was granted, pray'd <hi>That God would put it into the Hearts of the chief Magiſtrates of the Nation, to remove this curſed Toleration.</hi> But this <hi>Hewes,</hi> after the King was come in,<note place="margin">And one <hi>Hewes</hi> who before had called Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion curſed, knew not what to ſay now.</note> being ask'd by one, <hi>Whether he would account Toleration ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed now,</hi> anſwered only by the Shaking of his Head.</p>
            <p>Now tho' many of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> as hath been ſaid, were releaſed from Priſon, yet they ſuffer'd exceedingly in their Religious Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. Once a Company of <hi>Iriſhmen</hi> came to the <hi>Pall-Mall,</hi> when <hi>G. Fox</hi>
               <pb n="255" facs="unknown:003104_0266_0FEFF57400E45CF0"/>
was there; but the Meeting was already broke up; and he being gone up into a Chamber, heard one of thoſe rude Perſons, who was a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel,<note place="margin">At <hi>Pall Mall</hi> a deſperate <hi>Iriſh</hi> Colonel calm'd by <hi>G. Fox.</hi>
               </note> to ſay, <hi>He would kill all the</hi> Quakers. Whereupon <hi>G. Fox</hi> came down, and told him, <hi>The Law ſaid, an Eye for an Eye, and a Tooth for a Tooth; but thou threatneſt to kill all the</hi> Quakers, <hi>tho' they have done thee no Hurt:</hi> But ſaid he farther, <hi>Here is Goſpel for thee: Here's my Hair, here's my Cheek, and here's my Shoulder,</hi> turning it to him.<note place="margin">Laws made againſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts are exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted upon Proteſtant Diſſenters.</note> This ſo ſurprized the Colonel, that he and his Companions ſtood amaz'd, and ſaid, <hi>If this be your Principle as you ſay, we never ſaw the like in our Lives.</hi> To which <hi>G. Fox</hi> ſaid, <hi>What I am in Words, I am the ſame in Life.</hi> Then the Colonel carried himſelf lovingly; tho' a certain Ambaſſador who ſtood without, and then came in, ſaid, that this <hi>Iriſh</hi> Colonel was ſuch a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Man, that he durſt not come in with him, for fear he ſhould have done great Miſchief.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding ſuch like rude Encounters, yet by the Change of the Government, ſome Stop was put to the fierce Current of Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for the King being but newly ſettled on the Throne, ſhewed yet an Inclination to Lenity. But this Quiet did not laſt long, and was but a Time of Reſpiration: For the Churchmen inſtigated (as it ſeems very probable) by the Favourers of Popery, continued envious, and ſtaid but for an Opportunity to ſhew their Malice. An Inſtance of which hath been ſeen already on the Inſurrection of the Fifth-Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy-Men, and in the Sequel will be ſeen much clearer: ſince tho' they did not ſeem to perſecute for Conſcience-ſake, yet under a Colour of Juſtice, Laws were made uſe of, that had formerly been enacted for the Suppreſſion of Popery, and to ſecure the Kingdom againſt Jeſuits, and other traiterous Papiſts; theſe being the Laws, of which <hi>G. Fox</hi> in his Letter to the King, had ſaid, that <hi>they held up Perſecution about Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that it may be known what Laws thoſe were, and that it may alſo appear what an unreaſonable Uſe hath been made thereof, I ſhall here ſet them down, or Abſtracts of them; that ſo it may be more plainly ſeen, what aukward Means have been made uſe of, and how fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrouſly the Laws were executed. Sometimes I may interweave a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theſe Abſtracts ſome Obſervations, or an Account of a Caſe, which, tho' not placed in due Time, may yet be ſerviceable to give a true Notion of Things.

            <p>In the 27th Year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, a Law was made for Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Tithes: For that King having either given or ſold many Chappels and Abbies to Laymen, thoſe Laymen had no Right, as Prieſts claimed to have, to ſummon to Eccleſiaſtical Courts thoſe that failed in paying of Tithes. But for this a Law was provide, by Virtue of which a Judge of an Eccleſiaſtical Court might be helpful to Laymen, and in that Law it was ſaid,
<q>If the Judge of an Eccleſiaſtical Court make Complaint to two Juſtices of Peace <hi>(Quorum unus)</hi> of any Contumacy or Miſdemeanour committed by a Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in any Suit there depending for Tithes,<note place="margin">27 Hen. 8<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>By this Law (which is pretended to be ſtill in Force) many honeſt People have ſuffered, and been kept very long in Priſon: For they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to find Surety for the Payment of Tithes, which for Conſcience-ſake they could not give to ſuch Miniſters who lived from a forced Maintenance, and did not (as they judged) profit the People; it was in
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:003104_0267_0FEFF5B8518FCDC8"/>
the Power of the Prieſts to detain them Priſoners till the pretended Debt was paid; which the Perſecuted judged ſo unreaſonable, that ſome have therefore continued in Priſon for many Years, chuſing rather to die in Goal, than to uphold ſuch Preachers by paying Tithes to them. And the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſo called have never offered Reſiſtance, but Suffering and Forbearance have always been their Arms, tho' they were almoſt continually vexed with Laws that were never made againſt them; and more eſpecially were they moleſted with the Oath of Supremacy, which was made in the Beginning of the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> tho' (it may be) projected in the Time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, which runs thus:
<q>I <hi>A. B.</hi> do utterly teſtify and declare in my Conſcience, that the [King's] Highneſs is the only ſupreme Governor of this Realm,<note place="margin">Oath of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, 1 Eliz. cap. 1.</note> and of all other [His] Highneſs's Dominions and Countries, as well in <hi>all Spiritual or Eccleſiaſtical Things or Cauſes,</hi> as Temporal. And that no Foreign Prince, Prelate, State or Potentate hath, or ought to have any Juriſdiction, Power, Superiority, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence or Authority, <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> or <hi>Spiritual,</hi> within this Realm: And therefore I do utterly renounce and forſake all Foreign Juriſdictions, Powers, Superiorities and Authorities, and do promiſe, That from henceforth I ſhall bear Faith and true Allegiance to the [King's] Highneſs [His] Heirs and lawful Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors; and to my Power ſhall aſſiſt and defend all Juriſdiction, Privileges, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminences and Authorities granted or belonging to the [King's] Highneſs, [His] Heirs and Succeſſors, or united and annexed to the Imperial Crown of this Realm. So help me God, and by the Contents of this Book.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the firſt Year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> an Act was made for Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Common Prayer and Church-Service, having this Clauſe.
<q>Every Perſon ſhall reſort to their Pariſh-Church,<note place="margin">1. Eliz. cap. 2.</note> or upon Let thereof, to ſome other, every Sunday and Holiday, upon Pain to be puniſhed by Cenſures of the Church, and alſo to forfeit twelve Pence, to be levied by the Churchwardens there, for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of the Poor, upon the Offender's Goods by Way of Diſtreſs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here is to be noted, that ſome have proſecuted the pretended Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders on this Clauſe to obviate greater Severities; altho' this Law was made becauſe of the Papiſts, thereby to force them to come to Church; for about that Time there were not ſo many Proteſtant Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters in <hi>England,</hi> as afterwards; but theſe appearing in Time, were as well under the Laſh of this Law, as the Papiſts; for their religious Aſſemblies were not reckoned to be Churches, as the Steeple-houſes by a Metonymy generally have been called, at the ſame Rate as the <hi>Jews</hi> Meeting-houſes have been called <hi>Synagogues,</hi> tho' the Word it ſelf properly ſignifies the Aſſembly of the People.</p>
            <p>Now ſince the aforeſaid Law was was not ſtrictly obeyed, not only by Papiſts, but alſo by others, who aiming at a further Reformation, could not longer comply with the Rites of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in the 23d Year of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> a more ſevere Law was made, with this Clauſe.
<q>Every Perſon not repairing to Church,<note place="margin">23 Eliz. c. 2.</note> according to the Statute of 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 2. ſhall forfeit twenty Pounds for every Month they ſo make Default; and if they ſo forbear by the ſpace of twelve Months, after Certificate thereof made by the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary to the Kings Bench, a Juſtice of Aſſize, Goal-Delivery, or Peace of the County where they dwell, ſhall bind them with two ſufficient Sureties in 200 <abbr>l.</abbr> at leaſt, to the good Behaviour, from which they ſhall not be releaſed, until they ſhall repair to Church according to the ſaid Statute.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="257" facs="unknown:003104_0268_0FEFF57867E5CA78"/>This Law it ſeems was thought not ſevere enough; therefore in the 29th Year of the ſaid Queen, another Law was made with this Clauſe;
<q>The Queen may ſeize all the Goods and two third Parts of the Lands and Leaſes of every Offender not repairing to Church as aforeſaid,<note place="margin">26 Eliz. c. 6.</note> in ſuch of the Terms of <hi>Eaſter</hi> and <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> as ſhall happen next after ſuch Conviction, for the Sum then due for the Forfeiture of twenty Pounds a Month, and yearly after that (in the ſame Terms) according to the Rate of twenty Pounds a Month, for ſo long Time as they ſhall forbear to come to Church according to the ſaid Statute of 23 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Upon theſe Acts many were proſecuted; but in the Height of this Proceeding <hi>George Whitehead, Gilbert Latey,</hi> and others, ſollicited King <hi>Charles</hi> the IId in the Behalf of their Friends; which had ſuch Effect, that the King ordered Stay of Proceſs in divers Counties; yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Perſecution was continued till after his Death, both as to Impriſonment as well as ſeizing of Goods: And other old Laws were alſo made uſe of: For in the 35th Year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, when the Papiſts ſometimes were forming Plots againſt the Queen, an Act was made, containing the Effect of this Clauſe.</p>
            <q>
               <p>If any of above ſixteen Years of Age ſhall be convicted to have abſented themſelves above a Month from Church,<note place="margin">35 Eliz. c. 1.</note> without any lawful Cauſe, impugned the Queen's Authority in Cauſes Eccleſiaſtical, or frequented Conventicles, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded others ſo to do, under Pretence of Exerciſe of Religion, they ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Priſon, and there remain until they ſhall conform themſelves, and make ſuch open Submiſſion as hereafter ſhall be preſcribed: And if within three Months after ſuch Conviction they refuſe to conform, and ſubmit themſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereunto required by a Juſtice of the Peace, they ſhall in open Aſſize or Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions abjure the Realm: And if ſuch Abjuration happen to be before Juſtices of the Peace in Seſſions, they ſhall make Certificate thereof at the next Aſſize or Goal Delivery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And,</hi> If ſuch an Offender refuſe to abjure, or going away accordingly, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn without the Queen's Licence, he ſhall be adjudged a Felon, and ſhall not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Benefit of Clergy; but if before he be required to abjure, he makes his Submiſſion, the Penalties aforeſaid ſhall not be inflicted upon him.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Tho' it may be ſuppoſed this Act was made chiefly againſt Papiſts, yet ſome few of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſo called, have been proſecuted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, which was for their Lives; for if they had been willing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the Realm, yet ſuch, who for Conſcience-ſake could not ſwear at all, could not oblige themſelves by Oath that they would do ſo. And this being very well known, it once happened that one <hi>William A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> of <hi>Needham</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

Yes,</hi> ſaid <hi>Alexander. Then,</hi> returned the Judge, <hi>You ſhall have it; and I'll adviſe you to plead Not Guilty.</hi> So the Priſoners accordingly pleaded <hi>Not guilty.</hi> Then ſaid the Judge to the Proſecutors, <hi>Now you muſt prove theſe Men, neither to have been at their own Pariſh Church, nor at any other Church or Chappel, elſe they are not within this Act, which is a ſanguinary Law.</hi> Thus the Judge carried or his Diſcourſe to a Diſcharge of <hi>Alexander</hi> and his Friends from that ſevere Indictment: For the Proſecutors were not able to prove this with Evidence, as the Law required.

            <p>
               <q>I <hi>A. B.</hi> do truly and ſincerely acknowledge,<note place="margin">Oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance made 3 <hi>Jac. c.</hi> 4,</note> profeſs, teſtify and declare in my Conſcience, before God and the World, that our Sovereign Lord King <hi>James</hi> is lawful and rightful King of this Realm, and of all other his Majeſty's Dominions and Countries; and that the Pope, neither of himſelf, nor by any Authority of the Church or See of <hi>Rome,</hi> or by any other Means, with any other, hath any Power or Authority to depoſe the King, or to diſpoſe of any of his Majeſty's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms or Dominions, or to authorize any Foreign Prince to invade or annoy him, or his Countries, or to diſcharge any of his Subjects from their Allegiance and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to his Majeſty, or to give Licence or Leave to any of them to bear Arms raiſe Tumults, or to offer any Violence or Hurt to his Majeſty's Royal Perſon, State, or Government, or to any of his Majeſty's Subjects within his Majeſty's Dominions. Alſo I do ſwear from my Heart, that notwithſtanding any Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Sentence of Excommunication or Deprivation, made or granted, or to be made or granted by the Pope or his Succeſſors, or by any Authority derived, or pretended to be derived from him, or his See, againſt the ſaid King, his Heirs or Succeſſors, or any Abſolution of the ſaid Subjects from their Obedience, I will bear Faith and true Allegiance to his Majeſty, his Heirs and Succeſſors, and him and them will defend to the uttermoſt of my Power, againſt all Conſpiracies and Attempts whatſoever, which ſhall be made againſt his or their Perſons, their Crown and Dignity, by Reaſon or Colour of any ſuch Sentence or Declaration, or otherwiſe: And will do my beſt Endeavour to diſcloſe and make known unto his Majeſty, his Heirs and Succeſſors, all Treaſons and traiterous Conſpiracies, which I ſhall know or hear of to be againſt him, or any of them. And I do fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſwear, that I do from my Heart abhor, deteſt, and abjure, as impious and heretical, this damnable Doctrine and Poſition, that Princes which are excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated or deprived by the <hi>Pope,</hi> may be depoſed or murdered by their Subjects, or any other whatſoever. And I do believe, and in my Conſcience am reſolved, that neither the <hi>Pope,</hi> nor any Perſon whatſoever, hath Power to abſolve me of this Oath, or any Part thereof, which I acknowledge by good and full Authority to be lawfully miniſtred unto me, and do renounce all Pardons and Diſpenſations to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. And all theſe Things I do plainly and ſincerely acknowledge, and ſwear, according to the expreſs Words by me ſpoken, and according to the plain and common Senſe and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding of the ſame Words, without any Equivocation, or mental Evaſion, or ſecret Reſervation whatſoever. And I do make this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognition and Acknowledgement, heartily, willingly, and truly, upon the true Faith of a Chriſtian. So help me God.</q>

               <hi>The Oath of Allegiance,</hi> was afterwards cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Name of the <hi>Teſt;</hi> and the Introduction of it makes Mention of the Gun-powder Plot, and ſignifies that this Expedient was contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to diſcover Papiſts; and yet many of the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> have ſuffered thereby many Years; for tho' they did not refuſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their Allegiance, yet becauſe it was well known they were not for <hi>ſwearing at all;</hi> this Oath was continually made uſe of as a Snare to impriſon them. Now the Puniſhment ſtated againſt the Recuſants was a <hi>Praemunire.</hi> And how grievouſly many <hi>Quakers</hi> have been oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on that Account, tho' not eaſily related, yet I may give Inſtances

                  <p>Now, dearly Beloved, the preſent Conſiderations of my Heart are very many concerning the great Love of the Father, which hitherto hath been ſhewed unto us; we all know, how that he called us by his Grace, and turned our Hearts from the Vanities, and evil Ways of this World, and ſanctified us by his Word, and put his Image up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and called us by his Name, and redeemed us unto himſelf, and gave us the Teſtimony of his holy Spirit in our own Hearts, <hi>That we ſhould be his People, and he would be our God;</hi> he taught us, and inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us, and fed us, and gave us Peace and Reſt in himſelf, and freed us from the Bondage of Sin and Corruption, and from his Terror be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of Sin; and he removed our Tranſgreſſions, and blotted them out, and ceaſed to ſmite us any more, but brought us into the Land of Reſt, flowing with Mercy, and Peace, and Knowledge, and all good Things: This did the Lord our God do for us, in the Days of our Infancy, even when we were yet in our Sins, he called us forth, and cleanſed us from them; and when we were Strangers to him, he made himſelf known unto us; and when we were wholly ignorant, he gave us Knowledge, and when we were not a People, he raiſed us up, and made us worthy to be called by his Name; and thus, and after this Manner did the Father love us, and ſhew his Love unto us: This you know even as I do, and the Conſideration of it cauſeth me thus to expreſs it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="260" facs="unknown:003104_0271_0FEFF5BE610C24E0"/>Again, when he had thus wrought for us, and ſhewed Love unto us, he was pleaſed to call us out into his Work, to the turning and converting of others unto the Way of Life; he put his Spirit into us, and gave us Gifts of Knowledge and Utterance, and armed us with Wiſdom, and Strength, and Courage, and every Way fitted us for that Work and Service in which he hath carried us on; he, I ſay, fitted us for his Work, and called us into it, and carried us on joyfully in it, and all this of his free Love, and infinite Power; and what we have been, and what we have done, it hath been only of the Lord, and not of our ſelves, even of his Love which to us may be admirable; for alas, what were we but Children, and neither Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, nor Prophets Sons, and our Education unanſwerable for theſe Things, and to perform this Calling? And therefore it is the Lord, and only him that hath effected his own Purpoſe through us, and by us, as Inſtruments mean of our ſelves, but by him very excellent.</p>
                  <p>Again, he hath mightily proſper'd us in his Work, and a glorious Effect we have beheld of our Labours, and Travels, and Teſtimony; yea, the Lord hath been with us abundantly, and his Arm hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed us about, and he hath often given us great Victory over the Wiſe and Prudent of this World; he hath made his own Word often very powerful in our Mouths, to the wounding of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of our Enemies; and the Lord hath bleſſed our Teſtimony, to the Confounding of the Wiſdom of this World, and to the gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of many unto himſelf; and he hath gone forth before us in his Authority, and been always with us in his own Work; and our Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies, Labours, and Travels have been very precious and pleaſant unto the Lord, and all his People, and the Effect thereof cauſeth my Soul to rejoice, becauſe the Lord hath been with us, and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered us unto a great People, who have received our Witneſs, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted thereof unto their Salvation, and unto the Lord alone the Glory of all this appertaineth.</p>
                  <p>And for theſe eight Years and upward, the Hand of the Lord hath carried us thro' great Labours and Travels in his Service, and many Dangers, and Perſecutions, and Afflictions have attended us all this Time; and ye know that many a Time hath the Lord delivered us from the Hands of ſuch as would have deſtroyed us; and we have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered again, and again, out of Dangers and Difficulties, and the Lord hath been a preſent Help unto us in the Time of our Trouble; for the Plotting of the Wicked, and the Purpoſe of ungodly Men, hath often been broken for our Sakes, even many a Time have we been delivered out of the Snare that hath been laid for us, and we have ſeen our Enemies fall before us on the Right Hand, and on the Left; even the Wiſe in their Worldly Wiſdom, and the Fooliſh in their Brutiſhneſs, both Profeſſors and Profane hath our God often cut ſhort in their Deſires and Endeavours of our Deſtruction; and we have been wonderfully preſerved unto this Day; and all this I attribute to the infinite Love and Power of the Lord God, who is bleſſed for evermore.</p>
                  <p>And thro' all theſe Things we are yet alive, and the Lord doth not fail us unto this Hour, but he lives and walks in us, and with us, and his Teſtimony is with us, even the Seal of his good Spirit in our Hearts, that we are his Sons and Servants, and we are confirmed by many Tokens that he is our God, and we are his People, and that great Oppreſſion which we have met withal, hath not reſtrained us, but thro' it all have we grown, and proſpered unto this Day: And concerning the Things whereof we have teſtified theſe divers Years, I am no Way doubtful but our God will fulfil them, neither can
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:003104_0272_0FEFF57D82356630"/>
my Confidence be ſhaken by what is or can come to paſs; for Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt muſt fall, falſe <hi>Miniſtry</hi> and <hi>Worſhip,</hi> falſe <hi>Ways</hi> and <hi>Doctrines</hi> God will confound, falſe <hi>Power</hi> and falſe <hi>Church</hi> the Lord will lay low, and <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> muſt reign; and God will gather his People more and more, and glorious Days will appear; God will exalt his Kingdom upon Earth, and throw down the Kingdom of the Man of Sin; all Oppreſſion muſt ceaſe, and the Oppreſſors ſhall be no more; and God will free his People, and they ſhall be happy in this World, and for ever: Theſe Things have we propheſied from Day to Day; and my Faith is conſtant and unmoveable, that God will effect theſe Things in his Seaſon; for the Lord never yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived me, but what he hath ſaid will ſurely come to paſs.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, Brethren, let us be in Hope and Patience, and live in the Word of Patience, and not be faint-hearted, as tho' the Lord had forgotten us, or was unmindful of us, or as tho' he would not perform what he had teſtified of by us; for he is not a Man, that he ſhould lie, nor as a Man that he is given to Change: But lift up your Heads, for the Lord is with us, even in our greateſt Tribulations and Afflictions, and he will accompliſh his Purpoſe; for he is mighty to ſave his People, and to deſtroy his Enemies.</p>
                  <p>It is true, the Gates of Hell at this Time ſeem to be open againſt us, and we are a People like to be ſwallowed up of our Enemies, and Floods of Wickedneſs ſeem to overflow, and the Waves of the great Sea ſeem to be void of Mercy, and the Hope of our Adverſaries is to extinguiſh us from being a People, and to deſtroy us from the Face of the Earth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and the Hands of our Perſecutors are highly exalted at this Day, as tho' all that we have done for the Lord, by our Labours and Travels, ſhould now be made of none Effect.</p>
                  <p>Well, dear Brethren, tho' it be thus, yet our God can deliver us, and confound our Adverſaries; and we can appeal unto our God, and can ſpread our Cauſe before him; and he knows that our Sufferings and Afflictions are altogether unjuſt, and unequal, and unrighteous, and that our Perſecutors do afflict us out of their <hi>Envy,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any juſt Cauſe adminiſtred unto them by us; our God knows it, Angels and Saints know it, that we are at this Day a perſecuted People for Religion's-ſake; and this our preſent Affliction is not any juſt Puniſhment, either from the Juſtice of God, or from the Juſtice of Men.</p>
                  <p>For God hath given us the Witneſs of his eternal Spirit, that Wrath is not in him towards us; his Wrath be to his Enemies, but unto us is Joy and Peace for evermore: And the Lord clears us, and he juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies us, who then ſhall condemn us? He chargeth no Guilt upon us, as if we were unto our ſelves the Cauſe, by our Evil Deeds, of theſe our preſent Sufferings, and as if this were come to paſs upon us, as Puniſhment from the Hand of God: I ſay, it is not ſo; theſe our preſent Sufferings are not out of God's Anger towards us, for his Love is to us, let his Wrath be to his Enemies: And as I ſaid, neither is this Suffering in the Juſtice of Men; for unto all the World we can ſay, (and God himſelf ſhall plead our Cauſe) whom have we wronged or done Evil to? What Evil have we done to any Man's Perſon? Whoſe Goods have we falſly taken or coveted? Againſt whom have we deſigned Miſchief? Even the Lord himſelf be Judge between us and our Perſecutors in this Matter; for unto him we are known that we do deſire the Good of all, and not the Hurt of any, and yet we are dealt with as Evil-doers; when as the God of Heaven is Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in our Conſciences, that we neither plot nor contrive, nor agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate in Thought or Word the Hurt of any Man's Perſon; but we
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:003104_0273_0FEFF5C0428ECCE8"/>
walk juſtly towards all, it being our Principle to do to others as we would be done unto; and we can plead our Cauſe unto our God, and he ſhall plead our Cauſe with our Enemies, and this is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State of our Caſe; what we ſuffer at this Time, it is ſingly in the Cauſe of God, and for Righteouſneſs-ſake, and for the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Jeſus, which we hold; therefore freely let us commit our Cauſe unto the God of Heaven, and if we die, it is for him, and if we live, it is to him; and we ſeek not Vengeance againſt our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but leave it to the Lord to plead with them.</p>
                  <p>And dearly beloved, I hope I need not exhort you to be patient, and faithful, in this Day of our Trial, knowing that the Cauſe is ſo excellent in which we are tried, it is God's Cauſe, and not our own; and I hope you all have the Teſtimony of his Spirit in your Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, verifying the Truth of the Cauſe for which we ſuffer; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that Evidence, we need not to be doubtful as towards God, nor aſhamed before Men, if ſo be that every one feels the Evidence of the Spirit of God bearing Witneſs, that we ſuffer for Righteouſneſs-ſake, and for the Name of Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>And ſo, dear Brethren, lift up your Heads, and be aſſured that we are the Lord's, and in his Cauſe we are tried, and he will judge and avenge our Perſecutors in his Seaſon, and we ſhall be a People when the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> lie dead upon the Sea-ſhore, and when the raging Sea is dried up, this ſame People ſhall be ſafe: For hath the Lord done ſo excellent Things for us? Hath he led us forth, and bleſſed us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Day? And hath he preſerved us hitherto thro' many Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and Dangers? Hath he ſhewed infinite Love and Favour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us to this Hour? And will he now ſuffer us to be deſtroyed from being a People? Surely no. Will he give our Enemies their Heart's Deſire to out us all off, that they may blaſpheme his Name? Surely no. And if it be the Pleaſure of the Lord, that ſome of us ſhould ſeal our Teſtimony with our Blood, good is the Will of the Lord; not ours but his Will be done; for the Teſtimony that we have born for theſe divers Years, hath been ſo excellent in it ſelf, and in its Fruits and Effects, that the finiſhing of it deſerves the beſt Seal that poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly we can ſign it with, which is indeed our Heart's Blood; and this dwells upon my Spirit; and yet, tho' it ſhould be thus, my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence is ſure, that the Work of the Lord ſhall proſper, and our Teſtimony ſhall be glorious for ever, and this People ſhall never be extinguiſhed from being a People.</p>
                  <p>And I know not any Thing that remains upon our Part at this Day, but that we commit our ſelves into the Hand of the Lord, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the Seed of God, wherein our Election is ſure, before the World was, and for ever: And let us remember one another, and pray one for another; and let us ſtir up all the Children of our Father to Faithfulneſs and Patience, while we have Time; I ſay, let us walk to the Glory of the Lord, keeping Faith and a good Conſcience to our laſt End; our Teſtimony ſhall dever die, nor our Memories ever pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh when we are ceaſed to be; and tho' we ſuffer now the Loſs of Life, and all we have, yet the Effects thereof will be glorious in Ages to come, and our preſent Sufferings will haſten the Glory of God's Work throughout the World: Receive this as my Salutation to you all.</p>
                  <p>It is now eight Days ſince I left <hi>Ireland,</hi> where my Service hath been precious for the Lord for full ſix Months, all which Time the Lord carried me in much Faithfulneſs and Diligence in his Service, to the confirming of many in the Truth of God, and to the converting of
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:003104_0274_0FEFF57FAFC11130"/>
others; and thro' and becauſe of the Preſence of the Lord which was with me, I had a very precious Time, and was wonderfully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved thro' many Dangers and Trials; and I travelled near two thouſand Miles to and fro in that Land, and had very free Paſſage in the principal Cities and Towns, till my Work for the preſent was fully ended there, having more Time than could be expected to clear my Conſcience to all People. It would be too large to mention every partiular Tranſaction, wherein I perceived the eminent Hand of God with me; and alſo many Things I obſerved concerning the preſent State of Things which I ſhall not mention; for what have we to do with the Affairs of worldly Kingdoms? But as for Friends, it was well with them, they grow and increaſe in the Bleſſings and Fulneſs of the Father; and when I came thence all was quiet, and very few in Priſon, tho' (I ſuppoſe) the Tidings of Things as they are here, will produce the ſame Sufferings upon them: But I hope they will be bold and valiant for the Truth, in giving their Teſtimony by faithful Sufferings, till theſe Things be finiſhed.</p>
                  <p>Thus I remain in Life and Death, and when I am no more, in everlaſting Remembrance, your dear Brother and Companion, by doing and ſuffering for the Name of the Lord and his Truth. I am well, and at Liberty as yet.</p>

               <note place="margin">The Subſtance of an Addreſs from the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Court at <hi>Boſton,</hi> to K. <hi>Ch. II.</hi>
               </note> to juſtify their cruel Proceedings. Herein they ſaid, <hi>That they had choſen rather the pure Scripture Worſhip, with a good Conſcience, in that remote Wilderneſs among the Heathen, than the Pleaſures of</hi> England <hi>with Subjection to the Impoſition of the then ſo diſpoſed, and ſo far prevailing Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, which they could not do without an evil Conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the <hi>Quakers</hi> they ſaid, that they were <hi>open capital Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, and Seducers from the Glorious Trinity, the Lord Chriſt, the bleſſed Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, open Enemies to the Government it ſelf, and malignant Promoters of Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines directly tending to ſubvert both Church and State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover they ſaid, <hi>That at laſt they had been conſtrained for their own Safety to paſs a Sentence of Baniſhment againſt them on Pain of Death, ſince the Magiſtrate in Conſcience judged himſelf called for the Defence of all, to keep the Paſſage with the Point of the Sword held towards them; and that this could do no Harm to them that would be warned thereby; but the</hi> Quakers <hi>ruſhing themſelves thereupon was their own Act, and a Crime bringing their Blood upon their own Heads.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Could they have made the King believe this, they would willingly have done it; but he had too much Senſe to be thus impoſed upon, tho' they did whatever they could to prevent his hearing the other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in Order whereunto they ſaid, <hi>Let not the King hear Men's Words; your Servants are true Men, Fearers of God and the King, and not given to Change, zealous of Government and Order, not ſeditious to the Intereſts of Caeſar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How ſmooth and plauſible ſoever this ſeemed, yet it could not ſtand the Teſt; and <hi>E. Burroughs,</hi> who anſwered it in Print, addreſs'd the King thus.
<q>O King, this my Occaſion to preſent Thee with theſe Conſiderations is very urgent, and of great Neceſſity,<note place="margin">To which <hi>E. Burroughs</hi> returns an Anſwer in print ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs'd to the ſaid King.</note> even in the Behalf of innocent Blood, hoping that my Work will find ſuch Favour with thee, as to induce thee to the Reading and ſerious Conſideration thereof.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>E. Burroughs</hi> then examining all their pretended Reaſons, repreſented alſo to the King, how ſome of theſe Petitioners ſome Time before, had not ſtuck to write in a Letter from <hi>Boſton</hi> to one <hi>Gordon; There is more Danger in theſe</hi> Quakers <hi>to trouble and overcome</hi> England, <hi>than in the</hi> King of Scots, <hi>and all the Popiſh Princes in</hi> Germany; which plainly denoted, that they reputed the King a Troubler of <hi>England,</hi> whom they numbred with the Popiſh Princes of <hi>Germany.</hi> What <hi>E. Burroughs</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of the King for his Friends, we may ſee hereafter.</p>
            <p>But firſt I return to <hi>William Leddra,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>W. Leddra</hi> brought with his Log and Chains before the Court.</note> whom I left in Priſon.

               <pb n="267" facs="unknown:003104_0278_0FEFF584CA5591A0"/>
But none anſwered, only <hi>Simon Broadſtreet,</hi> one of the Court, ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, <hi>Whether he would go for</hi> England?

And for what you have againſt me I appeal to the Laws of</hi> England <hi>for my Trial; and if by them I am guilty, I refuſe not to die.</hi> Of this no Notice was taken, but inſtead thereof, they endeavoured to perſuade him <hi>to recant of his Error</hi> (as they ſtiled it) <hi>and to conform;</hi> to which with a grave Magnanimity he anſwered, <hi>What! to join with ſuch Murtherers as you are? Then let every Man that meets me ſay, Lo this is the Man that hath forſaken the God of his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>

               <hi>Wenlock Chriſtiſon,</hi> who was already baniſhed upon Pain of Death, came into the Court.

That the Sun abhorring this bloody Buſineſs, hid it ſelf from them. But after many Debates, the ſanguinary Council at length agreed, and <hi>Wenlock</hi> was brought to the Bar; where the Governor <hi>John Indicot</hi> asked him, <hi>What he had to ſay for himſelf, why he ſhould not die?</hi> He anſwered,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>W.Chriſtiſon</hi> brought to the Bar and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd.</note> 
               <hi>I have done nothing worthy of Death, if I had, I refuſe not to die.</hi> To this another ſaid, <hi>Thou art come in amongſt us in Rebellion, which is as the Sin of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, and ought to be puniſhed.</hi> Hence it appears how perverſely theſe Blood-thirſty Perſecutors apply'd the Holy Scriptures to their cruel Ends, and ſo made a wrong Uſe of the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi>'s Words to <hi>Saul:</hi> To which falſe Concluſion <hi>Wenlock</hi> anſwered, <hi>I came not among you in Rebellion, but in Obedience to the God of Heaven, not in Contempt to any of you, but in Love to your Souls and Bodies; and that you ſhall know one Day, when you and all Men muſt give an Account of the Deeds done in the Body. Take Heed</hi> (thus he went on) <hi>for you cannot eſcape the righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God.</hi> Then ſaid Major General <hi>Adderton, You pronounce Woes, and Judgments, and thoſe that are gone before you pronounced Woes and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but the Judgments of the Lord God are not come upon us yet.</hi> So in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent and hard Hearted may Man become, as not to ſtick even to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the moſt High. But before we draw the Curtains of this Stage, we ſhall ſee the tragical End of this <hi>Adderton,</hi> who now received this Anſwer from <hi>Wenlock: Be not proud, neither let your Spirits be lifted up; God doth but wait till the Meaſure of your Iniquity be filled up, and that you have run your ungodly Race; then will the Wrath of God come upon you to the uttermoſt. And as for thy Part, it hangs over thy Head, and is near to be poured down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, and ſhall come as a Thief in the Night ſuddenly, when thou thinkeſt not of it.</hi> Then <hi>Wenlock</hi> asked, <hi>By what Law will ye put me to Death?</hi> The Anſwer was, <hi>We have a Law, and by our Law you are to die. So ſaid the</hi> Jews, <hi>of Chriſt,</hi> (reply'd <hi>Wenlock) We have a Law, and by our Law he ought to die. Who impowered you to make that Law?</hi> To which one of the Board anſwered, <hi>We have a Patent, and are the Patentees; judge whether we have not Power to make Laws.</hi> Hereupon <hi>Wenlock</hi> asked again, <hi>How, have you Power to make Laws repugnant to the Laws of</hi> England? <hi>No,</hi> ſaid the Governor. <hi>Then (reply'd <hi>Wenlock</hi>) you are gone beyond your Bounds, and have forfeited your Patent; and that is more than you can anſwer. Are you</hi> (asked he) <hi>Subjects to the King, yea, or nay? What good will that do you,</hi> reply'd the Secretary. <hi>If you are,</hi> (anſwered <hi>Wenlock) ſay ſo; for in your Petition to the King, you deſire that he would protect you, and that you may be worthy to kneel amongſt his loyal Subjects.</hi> To which one ſaid, <hi>Yea, we are ſo. Well,</hi> ſaid <hi>Wenlock, ſo am I, and for any Thing I know, am as good as you, if not better; for if the King did but know your Hearts, as God knows them, he would ſee that they are as rotten towards him as they are towards God: Therefore ſeeing that you and I are Subjects to the King, I demand to be tried by the Laws of my own Nation.</hi> It was anſwered, <hi>You ſhall be tried by a Bench and a Jury:</hi> For it ſeems they began to be afraid to go on in the former Courſe, of Trial without a Jury, this being contrary to the Laws of <hi>England.</hi> But <hi>Wenlock</hi> ſaid, <hi>That is not the Law, but the Manner of it: For I never heard, nor read of any Law that was in</hi> England <hi>to hang</hi> Quakers. To this the Governor reply'd, That <hi>there was a Law to hang</hi> Jeſuits, To which <hi>Wenlock</hi> returned, <hi>If you put me Death, it is not becauſe I go under the Name of a</hi> Jeſuit, <hi>but of a</hi> Quaker: <hi>Therefore I appeal to the Laws of my own Nation.</hi> But inſtead of taking Notice of this, one ſaid, <hi>That he was in their Hands, and had broken their Law, and they would try him. Wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock</hi> ſtill appealed to the Law of his own Nation. Yet the Jury being called over, went out, but quickly returned, and brought him in guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Whereupon the Secretary ſaid, Wenlock Chriſtiſon, <hi>hold up your Hand. I will not,</hi> ſaid <hi>Wenlock, I am here, and can hear thee.</hi> Then the Secretary cried, <hi>Guilty or not Guilty. I deny all Guilt,</hi> reply'd <hi>Wenlock, for
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:003104_0283_0FEFF5CEEA664368"/>
my Conſcience is clear in the Sight of God.</hi> But the Governor ſaid, <hi>The Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hath condemned thee. Wenlock</hi> anſwer'd, <hi>The Lord doth juſtify me; who art thou that condemneſt?</hi> They then voted as to the Sentence of Death, but were in a Manner confounded, for ſeveral could not vote him guilty of Death. The Governor ſeeing this Diviſion, ſaid, <hi>I could find in my Heart to go Home;</hi> being in ſuch a Rage, that he flung ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing furiouſly on the Table; which made <hi>Wenlock</hi> cry, <hi>It were better for thee to be at home than here, for thou art about a bloody Piece of Work.</hi> Then the Governor put the Court to vote again; but this was done confuſedly, which to incenſed the Governor, that he ſtood up, and ſaid, <hi>You that will not conſent, record it; I thank God, I am not afraid to give Judgment.</hi> Thus we ſee that to be drunk with Blood doth not quench the Thirſt after Blood; for <hi>Indicot</hi> the Governor, ſeeing others backward to vote, precipitately pronounced Judgment himſelf, and ſaid, Wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock Chriſtiſon,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Indicot</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Death againſt him.</note> 
               <hi>hearken to your Sentence: You muſt return unto the Place from whence you came, and from thence to the Place of Execution, and there you muſt be hang'd until you are dead, dead, dead.</hi> To which <hi>Wenlock</hi> ſaid, <hi>The Will of the Lord be done, in whoſe Will I came amongſt you, and in whoſe Counſel I ſtand, feeling his eternal Power, that will uphold me unto the laſt Gaſp.</hi> Moreover he cried thus; <hi>Known be it unto you all, that if ye have Power to take my Life from me, my Soul ſhall enter into everlaſting Reſt and Peace with God, where you your ſelves ſhall never come. And if ye have Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to take my Life from me, the which I do queſtion, I do believe you ſhall never more take</hi> Quakers <hi>Lives from them: Note my Words; do not think to weary out the living God, by taking away the Lives of his Servants. What do you gain by it? For the laſt Man that you have put to Death, here are five come in his Room. And if ye have Power to take my Life from me, God can raiſe up the ſame Principle of Life in ten of his Servants, and ſend them among you in my Room, that you may have Torment upon Torment, which is your Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for there is no Peace to the Wicked, ſaith my God.</hi> The holy Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with which he uttered theſe Words, ſhew, and the Sequel made it appear plainly, that ſomething ſupernatural was contained in them: And it is remarkable, that among the impriſon'd <hi>Quakers,</hi> there were then ſeveral that had been baniſhed on Pain of Death; and among theſe alſo <hi>Elizabeth Hooton,</hi> and <hi>Edward Wharton</hi> ſtaid in his Habitation contrary to his Sentence of Baniſhment. <hi>Wenlock</hi> having received Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Death, was brought to Priſon again, where having been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd five Days,<note place="margin">Is brought back to Priſon, detain'd five Days, and then with 27 more of his Friends ſet at Liberty.</note> the Marſhal and a Conſtable came to him, with an Order from the Court for his Enlargement, with twenty-ſeven more of his friends, then in Priſon for their Teſtimony to the Truth, ſaying, They were ordered by the Court to make him acquainted with their new Law. <hi>What means this?</hi> ſaid <hi>Wenlock, Have ye a new Law? Yes,</hi> ſaid they. <hi>Then ye have deceived moſt People,</hi> ſaid <hi>Wenlock. Why?</hi> ſaid they. <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>they did think the Gallows had been your laſt Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon. Your Magiſtrates ſaid, that your Law was a good and wholeſome Law, made for your Peace, and the Safe-guard of your Country. What, are your Hands now become weak? The Power of God is over you all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the Priſon Doors were opened, and <hi>Wenlock,</hi> with twenty-ſeven more of his Friends, as aforeſaid, ſet at Liberty, ſave that two of them,<note place="margin">Only <hi>P.Pearſon</hi> and <hi>Jud. Brown</hi> were firſt whipt at the Carts Tail thro Boſton. The Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors apprehend the King's Diſpleaſure, who is offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on reading a Relation of their Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in <hi>G.

            <p>Now tho' not long after an Order came from the King, as will be ſaid anon, whereby theſe Perſecutors were charged to deſiſt from put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Quakers</hi> to Death, yet it ſeems they had got ſome Scent of the King's Diſpleaſure, who had a Mind to ſtop their bloody Career: For having got a Book written by <hi>George Biſhop,</hi> containing a Relation of

the cruel Perſecution in <hi>New-England,</hi> and reading a Paſſage concerning Major General <hi>Deniſon,</hi> who to put off thoſe that complained of their wicked Proceedings, ſaid, <hi>This Year ye will go to complain to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the next Year they will ſend to ſee how it is; and the third Year the Government is changed,</hi> he took much Notice of this, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to the Lords to hear it, ſaid, <hi>Lo, theſe are my good Subjects of</hi> New-England! <hi>But I will put a Stop to them.</hi> And it was not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an Opportunity was offered; for the News of <hi>William Leddra</hi>'s Death being come into <hi>England,</hi> with an Information of the Danger that others were in of going the ſame Way, their Friends took it ſo to Heart, eſpecially <hi>Edward Burroughs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">To prevent the like, <hi>E. Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs</hi> goes to the King, who promiſes to put a Stop thereto, and immediately grants a <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damus.</hi>
               </note> that having got Audience of the King, he ſaid to him, <hi>There was a Vein of innocent Blood opened in his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, which, if it were not ſtopt, would over-run all.</hi> To which the King replied, <hi>But I will ſtop that Vein.</hi> Then <hi>Burroughs</hi> deſired him to do it ſpeedily, <hi>for we know not,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>how many may ſoon be put to Death.</hi> The King anſwered, <hi>As ſpeedily as you will. Call</hi> (ſaid he to ſome preſent) <hi>the Secretary, and I will do it preſently.</hi> The Secretary being come, a <hi>Mandamus</hi> was forthwith granted. A Day or two after, going again to the King, to deſire Diſpatch of the Matter, the King ſaid, He had no Occaſion at preſent to ſend a Ship thither; but if they would ſend one, they might do it aſſoon as they could. <hi>E.

And that now befel <hi>Cromwel,</hi> which he ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſeven Years before in his Speech to the Parliament, as hath been mentioned in its due Place, <hi>viz. That he would rather be rowled into the Grave, and buried with Infamy, than give his Conſent to the throwing away one of the Fundamentals of that Government,</hi> to wit, <hi>Liberty of Conſcience.</hi> And yet he ſuffered Perſecution to go on, as hath been related at large: But now according to his Saying, he was rowled with Infamy into the Grave; which may ſerve indeed for a remarkable Inſtance of the Juſtice and equal Judgments of God.</p>

            <p>Whilſt the ſaid <hi>G. Fox</hi> was Priſoner in <hi>Lambeth</hi> Houſe, he writ alſo a ſmall Treatiſe, called, <hi>England's ſad Eſtate and Condition lamented.</hi> 
               <q>Herein he reproved the grievous Abominations committed among the Inhabitants Oppreſſion by Perſecution, and the Hypocriſy of the Prieſts. He alſo predicted the Peſtilence, as may be mentioned here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after in due Place; and ſignified not obſcurely that Endeavours would be uſed publickly to introduce Superſtition and Idolatry: But that thoſe who intended to do ſo, ſhould be fruſtrated by the Lord in their Attempts. And that others, whoſe Worſhip alſo did diſpleaſe the Lord, ſhould grind and waſte one another: But that beyond their Expectation he would pluck out from them, and preſerve a holy Seed. And that after he ſhould have executed his Vengeance upon the rebellious and treacherous Dealers, he would then bring forth the Remnant of his holy Seed, which ſhould be preſerved from their Fury, and then they ſhall ſpread over all, and ſtand in Dominion.</q> 
               <hi>But,</hi> thus continued he, <hi>Altho' theſe Things, touching the holy Remnant, ſhall certainly be fulfilled in their Seaſon, yet before they will be fully accompliſhed, great will be the Tryals of many of the Righteous, and there will be great Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments executed in thee, 0 Land, by him who oftimes makes a fruitful Land barren becauſe of the Wickedneſs of them that dwell therein.</hi> This and much more he writ, and publiſh'd it in Print. Several of his Predictions we have ſeen fulfilled, as in the Progreſs of this Hiſtory may appear: And this laſt we muſt refer to Time. After the Writing of this Treatiſe, he alſo gave forth the following Prayer.</p>

               <note place="margin">His Prayer.</note> 
               <hi>Surely it was thou, O Lord, that gave Bounds unto the Sea, that the Floods thereof could not overwhelm thy Choſen: Thou canſt let forth the Winds, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a Storm, and thou canſt make a Calm when thou pleaſeſt.

O Lord our Righteouſneſs, we will praiſe thy Name; for thy Mercies endure for ever. Our Eyes, O God, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, for we have no other Helper. Our Faith, O Lord, ſtandeth in thee, who canſt not forget thy People. Thou haſt revealed and brought up <hi>Jacob,</hi> who wreſtleth with thee, and prevails as a Prince, therefore muſt the Bleſſing come. O Lord, the Birth, the Birth, cryeth unto thee, thine own Elect which long hath been oppreſſed. Thou canſt not deny thy ſelf, therefore have we Faith, and Hope which maketh not aſhamed. Oh Lord, how unſearchable are thy Ways! Thou haſt even amazed thy People with the Depth of thy Wiſdom; thou alone wilt have the Glory of their Deliverance; and therefore haſt thou ſuffered theſe Things to come to paſs. O Lord, thou art righteous in all thy Judgments: Only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve thy People, which thou haſt gathered, and wilt gather unto thy ſelf, in the Day of Tryal; that ſo they may ſing of thy Power, and magnify thy Name in the Land of the Living.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Thus undaunted he ſhew'd himſelf. But it was not long before he made his Exit, of which I can't but ſay ſomething.

Now the Duſt was returned to the Earth, and the Spirit unto God who gave it. Thus he was freed of all Danger of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Crown of immortal Life, which Man by Temptation, and the Caſualties of this Life is liable unto, if he continueth not diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly watchful.

And ſince Novelties often draw People after them, ſo it was in this Caſe, inſomuch that he got pretty many Adherents. But he did not ſtand here; for as one Error proceeds from another, ſo he made ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extravagant Step, and let his Beard grow; in which he was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by ſome. In the mean while <hi>G.

I have heretofore made ſome Mention of the Impriſonment of <hi>Kathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine Evans</hi> and <hi>Sarah Cheevers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Hiſtory of the Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>K. Evans</hi> and <hi>S. Cheevers,</hi> by the Inquiſition at <hi>Malta,</hi> and their Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</note> by the Inquiſition at <hi>Malta.</hi> It was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this Time that they were releaſed: For <hi>G. Fox</hi> having understood that the Lord <hi>d' Aubery</hi> could procure their Liberty, went to him, and having informed him concerning their Impriſonment, deſired him to write to thoſe in Authority at <hi>Malta,</hi> for their Releaſe. This he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to do, and told <hi>G. Fox,</hi> if he would come again within a Month, perhaps he might hear of their Diſcharge. <hi>G. Fox</hi> went again to him about that Time, but he ſaid, he thought his Letters had miſcarried; yet he promiſed he would write again, and ſo he did; which was of ſuch Effect, that the ſaid two Women were diſcharged of their long Impriſonment. <hi>G. Fox</hi> had now Opportunity to reaſon with this Lord, who was a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> about Religion, and he brought him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, <q>That Chriſt had enlightned every Man that cometh into the World, with his Spiritual Light; and that he had taſted Death for every Man; and that the Grace of God, which brings Salvation, hath appeared to all Men; and that it would teach them, and bring their Salvation, if they did obey it.</q> Then <hi>G. Fox</hi> asked him, <hi>What the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts <hi>would do with all their Relicks and Images, if they did own and believe in this Light and receive the Grace to teach them, and bring their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> And he anſwered, <hi>Thoſe Things were but Policies to keep People in Subjection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But leaving theſe Diſcourſes, I'll now give a clear and circumſtantial Relation of the Impriſonment of the fore-mentioned <hi>Katherine Evans</hi> and <hi>Sarah Cheevers,</hi> chiefly collected from Letters and Papers, written by them in Priſon, and ſent from thence to <hi>England,</hi> where they were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in Print not long after their Return, in the Year, 1662.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1658, theſe Women having Drawings in their Mind to travel toward <hi>Alexandria,</hi> went with a Ship from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Leghorn</hi> in <hi>Italy;</hi> and having been thirty one Days between <hi>Plymouth</hi> and <hi>Leghorn,</hi> they at length ſafely landed at that City, where they found ſome of their Countrymen and Friends, and ſtaid there ſeveral Days, diſperſing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Books when Occaſion offered. They ſpoke alſo with People of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Degrees, without being moleſted by any. From thence they got Paſſage in a <hi>Dutch</hi> Ship bound for <hi>Alexandria,</hi> or <hi>Scanderoon;</hi> but the Maſter of the Ship, being in Company with another Ship going to <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> went alſo thither, tho' he had no Buſineſs in the Place: But before they came there, <hi>Katherine</hi> fell into ſuch an Anguiſh of Mind, that ſhe cry'd out, <hi>Oh, we have a dreadful Cup to drink at that Place!</hi> Being come into the Harbour, and ſtanding on the Deck of the Ship, and looking upon the People who ſtood on the Walls, ſhe ſaid in her Heart, <hi>Shall ye deſtroy us? If we give up to the Lord, then he is ſufficient to deliver us out of your Hands: But if we diſobey our God, all theſe could not deliver us out of his Hand.</hi> And ſo all Fear of Man was taken from them. The next Day, being the firſt Day of the Week, they went on Shore, where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſul met them, and asked them, <hi>What they came there for?</hi> They anſwered what they thought convenient, and gave him ſome Books. Then he told them, <hi>There was an Inquiſition;</hi> and kindly invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to his Houſe, ſaid, <hi>All that he had was at their Service while they were there.</hi> They accepting, of this Invitation, went thither, and many came to ſee them, whom they called to Repentance, ſo that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral became tender. About Night they went on Ship-board, and the next Day came again into the City, and going to the Governor, he told them he had a Siſter in the Nunnery who deſired to ſee them. Thereupon they went to the Nunnery, and talked with the Nuns, and gave them Books: And one of their Prieſts, who brought them into the Chappel, would have them bow to the High Altar: But
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:003104_0297_0FEFF5E2CF4EBB50"/>
they refuſed, being grieved becauſe of the Idolatry committed there, and went to the Conſul's again, where they ſtaid ſome Weeks. During that Time, they once went into one of the Places of Worſhip, in the Time of Worſhip; and <hi>Katharine</hi> ſtanding in the midſt of the People, turned her Back to the High Altar, and kneeling down, ſhe lifted up her Voice in Prayer to the Lord. The Prieſt that officiated, put off his Surplice, and kneeled near her, till ſhe had done. Then he reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth his Hand to them to come to him, and offered her a Token, which ſhe taking to be the Mark of the Beaſt, refuſed. Thereupon he put the Piece into <hi>Sarah</hi>'s Hand, but ſhe gave it him again, and ſhewed him her Purſe, that ſhe had to give, if any had Need, and as yet was in no Want, He then ask'd, <hi>If they were</hi> Calviniſts <hi>or</hi> Lutherans? And they anſwering, <hi>Nay;</hi> he ask d, <hi>If they would go to</hi> Rome <hi>to the Pope.</hi> They denying this, he ask'd, <hi>If they were</hi> Catholicks? To which they ſaid, <hi>They were true Chriſtians, Servants of the living God.</hi> But ſince they had yet learned but little of the Language ſpoken there, they expreſs'd themſelves very defectively, which they did, partly in Words, and partly by Signs, as well as they could: And many that came about them, were amazed: However at laſt they departed peaceably. Some Time after they went again to a Maſs-houſe, where the Sacrament, as they call it, was adminiſtred: There were many Lights; and great Coſtlineſs and Fineries; and being grieved becauſe of their Idolatry, they ſtood about three Quarters of an Hour, weeping and trembling, eſpecially <hi>Katherine:</hi> And this ſo ſtruck the Congregation with Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that ſome removed farther from them for Fear. At length they both went out, but yet under ſuch a Trembling, that they went along the Street reeling and ſtaggering, ſo that they became a Wonder to all that ſaw them.</p>
            <p>They were about three Months at the Houſe of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſul; and he, by Reaſon of that, being under a Suſpicion, did not what he might have done to ſave them; but in ſome Reſpect he delivered them up to the Inquiſition, tho' by his Oath he was obliged to protect the <hi>Engliſh</hi> there. In the mean while he kept them in his Houſe, and ſuffered them not to go abroad, tho' the Governor had told him, he might let them go about their Buſineſs; for ſaid he, <hi>They are honeſt Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi> The Conſul might alſo have let them go free, before they came under the Power of the Black Rod. Now they perceiving that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to their Prejudice was in Agitation, and making Account un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> already that a Priſon would be their Lot, they ſignified that they ſuſpected him, and told him, <hi>That</hi> Pilate <hi>would do the</hi> Jews <hi>a Service, and yet waſh his Hands in Innocency.</hi> He being at a Loſs, required a Sign of them, if <hi>they were the Meſſengers of God.</hi> And they gave him to underſtand, that this might ſerve for a Sign; <hi>That it would be well with them; but that it ſhould not go off well with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Afterwards it happened that they were ſent for by the Inquiſition: And that Day the Conſul's Wife brought them ſome Victuals; but as ſhe paſs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d by, <hi>Katharine</hi> was ſmitten, as with an Arrow, to the Heart, and ſhe ſeemed to hear a Voice, ſaying, <hi>She hath obtained her Purpoſe.</hi> Then <hi>Katharine</hi> would not taſte of the Meat, but went aſide, and wept exceedingly. The Conſul having called her, told her, The Inquiſition had ſent for them, having received Letters from <hi>Rome,</hi> but that <hi>he did hope they ſhould be ſet free:</hi> Which however was not true, for he knew (as they underſtood afterwards) there was a Room prepared for them in the Priſon of the Inquiſition. Neither was it long ere there came one with a Black Rod, and the Chancellor, and the Conſul, who brought them before the Lord Inquiſitor; and he asked them, <hi>Whether they had changed their Minds?</hi> (for it ſeems that had been required of
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:003104_0298_0FEFF5A02B852CA0"/>
them before.) But they anſwered, <hi>No,</hi> and <hi>that they ſhould not change from the Truth.</hi> Then he ask'd; <hi>What new Light it was they talked of.</hi> They anſwered, <hi>It was no new Light, but the ſame the Prophets and Apoſtles bore Teſtimony to.</hi> Next he ask'd, <hi>How this Light came to be loſt ſince the primitive Times?</hi> They reply'd, <hi>It was not loſt; Men had it ſtill in them, but they did not know it, by Reaſon that the Night of Apoſtacy had overſpread the Nations.</hi> Then he ſaid, <hi>If they would change their Minds, and do as they would have them, they ſhould ſay ſo, or elſe they would uſe them as they pleaſed.</hi> But they ſignifying that they would not change, ſaid, <hi>The Will of the Lord be done.</hi> He then aroſe and went away with the Conſul, leaving them there: And the Man with the Black Rod, and the Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, took and put them into an inner Room in the Inquiſition, which had only two little Holes in it for Light or Air. This Place was ſo exceeding hot, that it ſeem'd as if their Intent was to ſtifle them, as we may ſee in the Sequel. Not long after they were brought before the Inquiſitors to be farther examined, and they not only ask'd their Names, but alſo the Names of their Husbands and Parents, and what Children they had, and alſo why they came thither. To which they anſwered, <hi>They were Servants of the living God, being come there to call them to Repentance.</hi> The next Day they were called again, but then examin'd aſunder; and <hi>Sarah</hi> being ask<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To which ſhe ſaid, <hi>She ſhould ſpeak the Truth, but ſhe would not ſwear;</hi> for Chriſt had commanded, <hi>Swear not at all.</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſul who was preſent, endeavour'd to perſwade her to ſwear, and ſaid, That <hi>none ſhould do her any Harm.</hi> She having ſome Books with her, they were taken from her; and they asked her, <hi>Wherefore ſhe brought thoſe Books?</hi> To <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hich ſhe anſwered, <hi>Becauſe they could not ſpeak their Language</hi> Then they asked her, <hi>What</hi> George Fox <hi>was?</hi> She anſwered, <hi>A Miniſter.</hi> Farther they asked, <hi>Wherefore ſhe came thither?</hi> And ſhe replied, <hi>To do the Will of God as ſhe was moved of the Lord.</hi> The next Queſtion was, <hi>How the Lord did appear unto her?</hi> To which ſhe anſwered, <hi>By his Spirit.</hi> And being asked, <hi>Whether ſhe did ſee his Preſence, and hear his Voice?</hi> Her Anſwer was, <hi>She heard his Voice, and ſaw his Preſence.</hi> They then asked, <hi>What he ſaid to her?</hi> She anſwerecd, That <hi>he required of her to go over the Seas to do his Will.</hi> This made them ask, <hi>How ſhe knew it was the Lord who required this of her?</hi> To which ſhe anſwered, That <hi>ſince he had ſignified to her, that his living Preſence ſhould go along with her, ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

She anſwered, <hi>We own the ſame Chriſt, and no other; he is the ſame Yeſterday, to Day, and for ever.</hi> Next they asked her, <hi>What ſhe would do at</hi> Jeruſalem? She anſwered, <hi>She did not know that ſhe ſhould go thither; but ſhe intended to have gone to</hi> Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria. They asked, <hi>What to do?</hi> Her Anſwer was, <hi>The Will of God: And,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>if the Lord opened my Mouth, I ſhould call People to Repentance, and declare to them the Day of the Lord, and direct their Minds from Darkneſs

to Light.</hi> They asked her alſo, <hi>Whether ſhe did ſee the Lord?</hi> She an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>God was a Spirit, and he was ſpiritually diſcern'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now tho' from the Anſwers of theſe Women, little could be got to blame them, yet they were kept cloſe Priſoners, which ſeem'd to grieve the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſul, for he came to them with Tears in his Eyes, and ſaid, <hi>He was as ſorry as for his own Fleſh:</hi> For it ſeems he had received ſomething for delivering them up, which he would willingly have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven back, if thereby he could have obtained their liberty; But a ſlaviſh Fear poſſeſs'd him, and he never had Peace while he lived. Some Days after, there came a Magiſtrate, two Friars, the Man with the Black Rod, a Scribe, and the Keeper of the Inquiſition to examine them; and they were again required to ſwear: But they anſwered as before, that Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Swear not at all;</hi> and that the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> gave the ſame Charge.

Then,</hi> ſaid the Women, <hi>Ye work Miracles; for Chriſt's Virtue is the ſame as it was when be turned Water into Wine at the Marriage in</hi> Cana. The Friar ſaid, <hi>If we don't eat the Fleſh, and drink the Blood of the Son of God, we have no Life in us.</hi> They reply'd, <hi>The Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt is ſpiritual, and we do feed upon it daily; for that which is begotten of God in us, can no more live without ſpiritual Food, than our temporal Bodies can without temporal Food.</hi> Then he ſaid, <hi>You never hear Maſs. But we,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>hear the Voice of</hi> Chriſt; <hi>he only hath the Words of eternal Life; and that is ſufficient, for us.</hi> He ſaid, <hi>Ye are Hereticks and Heathens.</hi> To which they reply'd, <hi>They are Hereticks that live in Sin and Wickedneſs, and ſuch are Heathens that know not God.</hi> Then it was asked them, <hi>Who was the Head of their Church?</hi> They told him, <hi>Chriſt.</hi> It was farther ask'd, <hi>What</hi> George Fox <hi>was?</hi> And they ſaid, <hi>He is a Miniſter of Chriſt.</hi> And it being ask'd, <hi>Whether he ſent them?</hi> Their Anſwer was, <hi>No; the Lord did move us to come.</hi> Then the Friar ſaid, <hi>Ye are deceived, and have not the Faith, tho' ye had all Virtues</hi> And they replied, <hi>Faith is the Ground from whence Virtues proceed.</hi> Hereupon it was told them, <hi>If they would take the Holy Sacrament, they might have their Liberty; or elſe the Pope would not leave them for Millions of Gold; but they ſhould loſe their Souls and Bodies too.</hi> To this they ſaid, <hi>The Lord hath provided for our Souls, and our Bodies are freely given up to ſerve him.</hi> Then it was ask'd them, <hi>If

they did not believe Marriage was a Sacrament?</hi> And they anſwered, <hi>It was an Ordinance of God.</hi> It was farther ask'd, <hi>If they did believe Men could forgive Sins?</hi> And their Anſwer was, <hi>That none could forgive Sins but God only.</hi> After ſome other Words to and fro, the Women asked, <hi>Wherein have we wronged you, that we ſhould be kept Priſoners all the Days of our Life? Our innocent Blood will be required at your Hands.</hi> The Friar ſaid, <hi>He would take their Blood upon him.</hi> They replied, <hi>The Time would come he ſhould find he had enough upon him without it.</hi> Then it was told them, <hi>The Pope was Chriſt's Vicar, and what he did was for the Good of their Souls.</hi> To this they anſwered, <hi>The Lord hath not committed the Charge of our Souls to the Pope, nor to you neither; for he hath taken them into his own Poſſeſſion: Glory be to his Name for ever.</hi> Then it was ſaid unto them, <hi>They muſt be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient.</hi> And they returned, <hi>They were obedient to the Government of Chriſt's Spirit, or Light.</hi> The Friar ſaid, <hi>None have the true Light but the</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks: <hi>The Light that you have, is the Spirit of the Devil. Wo</hi> (ſaid they) <hi>to him that curſeth Jeſus! Can the Devil give Power over Sin and Iniquity? That would deſtroy his own Kingdom.

            <p>At another Time being examined, they were asked, <hi>How many of their Friends were gone forth in the Miniſtry, and into what Parts?</hi> They anſwering to that Query what they knew, it was told them, <hi>All that came where the Pope had any thing to do, ſhould never go back again.</hi> But they ſaid, <hi>The Lord was as ſufficient for them, as he was for the Children in the fiery Furnace, and their Truſt was in God. Katharine</hi> being ſickly, was ask'd, <hi>Why ſhe lookt ſo, whether her Spirit was weak?</hi> She anſwered, <hi>Nay, my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is weak, becauſe I eat no Meat.</hi> The Friar hearing this, offered her a Licenſe to eat Fleſh; for it was in their <hi>Lent.</hi> But ſhe refuſed this, and ſaid, <hi>She could not eat any thing at all.</hi> And going afterwards to Bed, ſhe lay there Night and Day for twelve Days together, faſting and ſweating, for ſhe was in much Affliction, and great was her Agony.</p>
            <p>After having lain Ten Days, there came to her two Friars, the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, the Man with the Black Rod, a Phyſician, and the Keeper.

Then the Friar went to <hi>Sarah,</hi> and told her, <hi>that</hi> Katharine <hi>called him Worker of Iniquity. Did ſhe</hi> ſaid <hi>Sarah, Art thou without Sin?</hi> To which he ſaid, <hi>he was.

            <p>Late in the Evening ſomething was proclaimed at the Priſon-Gate, by beating of a Drum, and early in the Morning ſome came again with a Drum and Guns. It ſeems to me that this was done on Purpoſe to frighten theſe poor Women, and to make them believe that they ſhould be put to Death; for indeed they look'd for little leſs, having for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Weeks expected that they ſhould be led to the Stake: But they were fully reſigned, and given up to what the Lord might be pleaſed to permit. In the mean while, <hi>Katharine</hi> continuing ſickly, the Friar came again with the Phyſician. But ſhe told him, <hi>She could not take any Thing, unleſs ſhe felt Freedom.</hi> He then ſaid, <hi>They muſt never come forth of that Room while they lived:</hi> And pretending to be kind to them, he farther ſaid, <hi>You may thank God and me, that it is no worſe; for it was like to be worſe.</hi> Thereupon they ſaid, That <hi>if they had died, they had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as innocent as ever any Servants of the Lord.</hi> He then ſaid, <hi>It was well they were innocent;</hi> and turning to <hi>Sarah,</hi> he bid her, <hi>Take Notice what Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> Katharine <hi>ſhould be in at the Hour of Death;</hi> ſaying, <hi>Thouſands of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils would fetch her Soul to Hell.</hi> But <hi>Sarah</hi> told him, <hi>She did not fear any ſuch Thing.</hi> He then asked <hi>Katharine, if ſhe did not think it expedient for the Elders of the Church to pray over the Sick.</hi> And ſhe ſaid, <hi>Yea, ſuch as are moved of the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> He then fell down on his Knees, and did howl, and wiſh bitter Wiſhes upon himſelf, if he had not the true Faith. The Phyſician in the mean while was enraged, becauſe ſhe did not bow to him.</p>
            <p>Now whilſt <hi>Katharine</hi> was ſick, <hi>Sarah</hi> was not without great Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for it grieved her to ſee her dear Companion ſo ill; and ſhe eaſily foreſaw, that if <hi>Katharine</hi> died, her own Sufferings would be heavier. But yet ſhe was given up to the Will of the Lord, and would not in the leaſt grudge at <hi>Katharine</hi>'s eternal Reſt. But in Time, <hi>Katharine</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to mend, and grow hungry; and eating, ſhe was refreſhed. But the Room wherein they were locked was ſo exceſſively hot, that they were often fain to riſe out of their Bed, and lie down at the Chink of the Door, for Air to fetch Breath. And this Heat was the greater, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it came not only from without, but within alſo; which ſo affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, that their Skin was parched, and the Hair fell off their Heads, and they fainted often; and their Afflictions were ſo great, that when it was Day, they wiſhed for Night; and when it was Night, they wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Day; yea, thro' human Weakneſs they deſired Death, eating their Bread weeping, and mingling their Drink with Tears. Once <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine</hi> asked the Monks, who came to her with a Phyſician, and ſaid it was in Charity, <hi>Whether they did not keep them in that hot Room to kill them, and bring a Phyſician to keep them longer alive?</hi> To this the Friar ſaid, <hi>The Inquiſitor would loſe his Head, if he ſhould take them thence; and it was better to keep them there than to kill them.</hi> Then they writ to the Inquiſitor, and laid their Innocency before him; and ſaid alſo, <hi>If it were their Blood they thirſted after, they might take it any other Way, as well as to ſmother them in that hot Room.</hi> But this ſo incenſed him, that he ſent the Friar to them, who took away their Ink-horns, their Bibles being taken from them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:003104_0302_0FEFF6255ED5FB60"/>
They asked then, <hi>Why their Goods were taken away?</hi> To which it was anſwered, <hi>All is ours; and your Lives too if we will.</hi> Then they ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>How they had forfeited their Lives?</hi> To which it was told them, <hi>For bringing Books and Papers.</hi> They reply'd, <hi>If there were any Thing in them that was not true, they might write againſt it.</hi> To this the Monk ſaid, <hi>They ſcorned to write to Fools and Aſſes, that did not know true Latin.</hi> And it was farther told them, <hi>The Inquiſitor would have them ſeparated, becauſe</hi> Katha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine <hi>was weak, and ſhe ſhould go into a cooller Room; but</hi> Sarah <hi>ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide there.</hi> Then <hi>Katharine</hi> took <hi>Sarah</hi> by the Arm, and ſaid, <hi>The Lord hath joined us together, and Woe be to them that part us. I had rather die here with my Friend, than part from her.</hi> This ſo ſtruck the Friar, that he went away, and came no more in five Weeks, and the Door of their Room was not opened in all that Time.</p>
            <p>Then the Monks came again to part them, but <hi>Katharine</hi> was ſick, and broken out from Head to Foot. They thereupon ſent for a Doctor, and he ſaid, <hi>They muſt have Air, or elſe they muſt die.</hi> This was told the Inquiſitor, and he ordered the Door to be ſet open ſix Hours in a Day. But ten Weeks after, they were parted; which was ſuch a grievous Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, that they declared, Death it ſelf would not have been ſo hard to them. But the Monks ſaid, <hi>They corrupted each other, and that being parted, they would bow and ſubmit.</hi> But they ſaw themſelves diſappointed; for the Women were ſtronger afterwards than before, the Lord fitting them for every Condition. Before they were parted, the Friars brought them a Scourge of ſmall Hempen Cords, asking them, <hi>If they would have it?</hi> and ſaying, <hi>they were uſed to whip themſelves till the Blood came.</hi> But the Women ſaid, <hi>that could not reach the Devil, he ſat upon the Heart.</hi> Then the Monks ſaid, <hi>All the People of</hi> Malta <hi>are for you; if ye will be Catholicks, none but will like you.</hi> To which they returned, <hi>The Lord hath changed us into that which changeth not.</hi> The Monks then ſaid, <hi>All our holy Women do pray for you; and ye ſhall be honoured of all the World, if ye will turn.</hi> They replied, <hi>The World lies in Wickedneſs, and the Honour and Glory of the World we have denied.</hi> To this the Monks ſaid, <hi>Ye ſhall be honoured of God too; but now ye are hated of all. This,</hi> ſaid one of the Women, <hi>is an evident To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken whoſe Servants we are. The Servant is not greater than his Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Once on a firſt Day of the Week the Friars came, and commanded them <hi>to kneel down with them to Prayer.</hi> They ſignified they could not pray, but as they were moved by the Lord. Then the Friars comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them the ſecond Time, and kneeled down by their Bedſide, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after this Manner; which being done, they ſaid to the Women, <hi>We have tried your Spirits, now we know what Spirit ye are of.</hi> But they told them, <hi>They could not know that, unleſs their Minds were turned to the Light of Chriſt in their Conſciences.</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Friar then growing angry, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them his Crucifix, and bid them look on it. But they told him, the Lord ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelf the Likeneſs of any Thing that is in Heaven above, or in the Earth beneath, or in the Water under the Earth; thou ſhalt not bow to them, nor worſhip them, but I the Lord thy God am a jealous God.</hi> The Friar ſeeing <hi>Sarah</hi> ſpeak ſo boldly to him, called for the Irons to chain her. She then bowed her Head, and ſaid to him, <hi>Not only my Hands and Feet, but my Neck alſo for the Teſtimony of Jeſus.</hi> The Friar ſeeming appeaſed, ſaid, <hi>He would do them any Good he could; far he ſaw what they did was not in Malice.</hi> And the Friars came often and ſaid to them, <hi>If ye would but do a little, ye ſhould be ſet at Liberty; but you will do nothing at all, but are againſt every Thing.</hi> To which they returned, <hi>that thy would do any Thing that might tend to God's Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilſt they were impriſoned here, it happened that the Inquiſition-Houſe was new built, or repaired, which took up about the Space of a Year and a Half; and during this Time ſome of the great Ones
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:003104_0303_0FEFF5E6D4BAB3A0"/>
came often to ſee the Building, which gave Opportunity to theſe Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to ſpeak to them, and to declare the Truth in the Name ot the Lord.</p>
            <p>Now tho' they were threatned by the Monks for preaching the Light of Chriſt ſo boldly, yet not only the Magiſtrates, but the Lord Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor grew moderate towards them, and gave Order they ſhould have Pens, Ink and Paper to write to <hi>England.</hi> And they ſeemed inclined to have ſet them at Liberty; but the Friars workt mightily againſt it; and had laboured about three Quarters or a Year to part them, before they could bring it to paſs. And when at length they had effected it, they told <hi>Katharine, That they ſhould never ſee one another's Faces again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean while, <hi>Katharine</hi> being ſickly, had little Stomach to eat, and had no Mind to eat any Thing but what came from <hi>Sarah</hi> to her. And having told one of the Friars, that ſhe wanted ſome body to waſh her Linnen, and to prepare ſome warm Victuals for her, he ſent to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi> to know if ſhe would do it for her; and ſhe ſaid ſhe would. And by that Means they for ſome Weeks heard of one another every Day; and the Friar ſaid once to <hi>Katharine, You may free your ſelf of Miſery when you will; you may make your ſelf a Catholick, and have your Freedom to go where you will:</hi> To which ſhe told him, <hi>Thus I might have a Name that I did live, when I was dead. Thou haſt Catholicks enough already. Endeavour to bring ſome of them to the Light in their Conſciences, that they may ſtand in awe, and ſin not.</hi> But he was ſo eager, that he ſaid, <hi>He would loſe one of his Fingers, if ſhe and</hi> Sarah <hi>would be Catholicks.</hi> Then ſhe told him, <hi>It was</hi> Babylon <hi>that was built with Blood, but</hi> Sion <hi>was redeemed thro' Judgment.</hi> Many Ways were uſed to draw them off; and once they would have perſwaded her to ſet a Picture at her Bed's Head, for a Repreſentation: But ſhe ſaid as with Abhorrence, <hi>What, do ye think I want a Calf to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip? Do ye walk by the Rule of Scripture?</hi> To which the Friar ſaid, <hi>We do, but we have Traditions too.</hi> She replied, <hi>If your Traditions derogate or diſſent from the Fundamentals of Chriſt's Doctrine, the Prophets and Apoſtles, I deny them in the Name of the Lord.</hi> But he aſſerted <hi>that they did not.</hi> Then ſhe asked, <hi>What Rule they had to burn thoſe that could not joyn with them for Conſcience Sake?</hi> And he returned, <hi>St.</hi> Paul <hi>did worſe, for he gave them to the Devil;</hi> and farther ſaid, <hi>that they did judge all damned that were not of their Faith.</hi> Then ſhe objected to him ſeveral of the ſuperſtitious Rites of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and mentioned alſo the <hi>forbidding of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, which,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 3.</note> ſaid ſhe, <hi>is a Doctrine of Devils,</hi> according to the Saying of the Apoſtle. The Friar being put to a Nonplus, told her, <hi>That St.</hi> Peter <hi>was the Pope of</hi> Rome, <hi>and did build an Altar there, and the Pope was his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, and he could do what he would.</hi> But ſhe refuted this with ſound Reaſon. He then boaſting of the Antiquity of their Church, ſhe ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified that the Church ſhe was of was yet older; for, ſaid ſhe, <hi>Our Faith was from the Beginning; and</hi> Abel <hi>was of our Church.</hi> The Friar be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a Loſs, and not longer able to hold out againſt <hi>Katharine,</hi> went to <hi>Sarah,</hi> and talked with her at the ſame Rate; and ſhe alſo told him, <hi>Abel was of our Church:</hi> To which he ſaid, <hi>Abel was a Catholick;</hi> and quite over-ſhooting himſelf, he ſaid likewiſe, <hi>and</hi> Cain <hi>and</hi> Judas <hi>were ſo.</hi> To which <hi>Sarah</hi> returned, <hi>Then the Devil was a Catholick; and I won't be one; I will not turn; tho' ye would tear me to Pieces, I believe the Lord would enable me to endure it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At another Time the ſaid Friar, whoſe Name was <hi>Malachy,</hi> came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to <hi>Katharine,</hi> and told her, <hi>If ſhe would be a Catholick, ſhe ſhould ſay ſo; otherwiſe they would uſe her badly, and ſhe ſhould never ſee the Face of</hi> Sarah <hi>again, but ſhould die by her ſelf, and a thouſand Devils ſhould carry her Soul to H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Monk, <hi>becauſe you will not be a Catholick.</hi> Whereupon ſhe ſaid, <hi>I deny thee and thy Meſſage too, and the Spirit which ſpeaks in thee; for the Lord ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſpoke ſo.</hi> He growing angry, ſaid, that <hi>he would lay her in a whole Pile of Chains, where ſhe ſhould ſee neither Sun nor Moon.</hi> And ſhe intimating how reſigned ſhe was, ſaid, <hi>He could not ſeparate her from the Love of God in Criſt Jeſus, lay her were-ever he would.</hi> And he farther ſaying, <hi>he would give her to the Devil,</hi> ſhe reſumed, <hi>I don't fear all the Devils in Hell; the Lord is my Keeper. Tho' thou hadſt the Inquiſition, with all the Countries round about it on thy Side, and I was alone by my ſelf, I do not fear them; if there were Thouſands more, the Lord is on my Right Hand; and the worſt they can do, is but to kill the Body, they can touch my Life no more than the Devil could</hi> Job's. Then the Monk ſaid, <hi>ſhe ſhould never go out of that Room alive.</hi> To which ſhe couragiouſly ſaid, <hi>The Lord is ſufficient to deliver me; but whether he will or no, I will not forſake the living Fountain, to drink at a broken Ciſtern. And ye have no Law to keep us here, but ſuch a Law as</hi> Ahab <hi>had for</hi> Naboth's <hi>Vineyard.</hi> The Monk then curſing himſelf, and calling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Gods, ran away, and as he was pulling the Door, he ſaid, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide there, Member of the Devil.</hi> To which ſhe ſaid, <hi>The Devil's Members do the Devil's Works; and the Woes and Plagues of the Lord will be upon them for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He then went and told the Inquiſitor of it, who laugh'd at him; and before he came again, <hi>Katharine</hi> was moved out of that Room; when he came, he brought one of the Inquiſitor's Men with him, and two very good Hens, and ſaid, <hi>The Lord Inquiſitor had ſent them in Love to her.</hi> To which ſhe ſaid, <hi>She received his Love,</hi> but yet ſhe ſhewed herſelf not very ready to accept them; and ſignified, <q>That ſhe was willing to pay for them, being loth to be chargeable to any, whilſt ſhe had of her own.</q> The Friar, who it ſeems would have had them lay down their Money, at his Feet, ſaid, <hi>They muſt not count any Thing their own; for in the primitive Times, they ſold their Poſſeſſions, and laid them down at the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Feet.</hi> He further ſaid, <hi>You ſhall not want any Thing, tho' we ſhould ſpend a thouſand Crowns. But you are proud, becauſe you will not take the Inquiſitor's Hens, which he ſent you in Charity.</hi> She then asking, <hi>What Kind of Charity this was, ſince he kept her in Priſon?</hi> The Friar ſaid, <hi>It was for the Good of their Souls he kept them in Priſon,</hi> farther adding, <hi>If you had not been going to preach, ye might have gone where ye would.</hi> She returned, <hi>Our Souls are out of the Inquiſitor's Reach. Why ſhould your Love extend more to us than to your own Family? For they commit all Manner of Sin, which you cannot charge us with. Why don't ye put them into the Inquiſition, and bid them turn?</hi> He then ſaid, <hi>You have not the true Faith;</hi> and ſhewing her his Crucifix, ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, <hi>If ſhe thought he did worſhip that?</hi> And ſhe asked him, <hi>What then did he with it?</hi> To which he anſwered, <hi>It was a Repreſentation.</hi> And ſhe replied, <hi>It did not repreſent Chriſt, for he was the expreſs Image of his Father's Glory, which is Light and Life. But,</hi> continued ſhe, <hi>If thou canſt put any Life in any of thy Images, then bring them to me. What Repreſentation had</hi> Daniel <hi>in the Lion's Den, or</hi> Jonas <hi>in the Whale's Belly? They cried unto the Lord, and he delivered them.</hi> The Friar, who could not abide to hear her ſpeak ſo much againſt Idols, ſaid, <hi>She talked like a mad Woman,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>I'll give you to the Devil.</hi> She not fearing this, ſaid, <hi>Give thy own, I am the Lord's.</hi> He then ſtood up, and ſaid, <hi>I will do to you, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles did to</hi> Ananias <hi>and</hi> Sapphira. She then ſtanding up alſo, ſaid, <hi>I deny thee in the Name of the Lord, the living God, thou haſt no Power over me.</hi> Then away he went with the Hens to <hi>Sarah,</hi> and told her, <hi>that</hi> Katha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine <hi>was ſick, and the Lord Inquiſitor had ſent two Hens, and ſhe would be glad to eat a Piece of one, if ſhe would dreſs one of them preſently, and the other To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow. Sarah</hi> no leſs circumſpect, and cautious than <hi>Katharine,</hi> and unwilling to receive this Gift, before ſhe knew what might be expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:003104_0305_0FEFF5E906CE66B0"/>anſwered him accordingly as <hi>Katharine</hi> did. Then he carryed the Hens away again, ſaying, <hi>You would fain be burnt, becauſe you would make the World believe you did love God ſo well as to ſuffer in that Kind. Katharine</hi> hearing this, ſaid, <hi>I do not deſire to be burnt; but if the Lord ſhould call me to it, I believe he will give me Power to undergo it for his Truth: And if every Hair of my Head was a Body, I could offer them up all for the Teſtimony of Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Friar coming afterwards again, ask'd <hi>Katharine, Whether ſhe had not been inſpired of the Holy Ghoſt to be a</hi> Catholick, <hi>ſince ſhe came into the Inquiſition.</hi> She ſaid, <hi>No.</hi> But he maintaining the contrary, ſaid, <hi>You are thoſe who call the Spirit of the Holy Ghoſt, the Spirit of the Devil. No,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied they, (who tho' they were parted, yet could hear one another) <hi>The Spirit of the Holy Ghoſt in us will reſiſt the Devil. And the Inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt is not wrought in the Will of Man, nor in Man's Time; but in God's Will and Time.</hi> More Diſcourſe they had about this Matter, and then asking for their Bibles, which had been taken from them, he ſaid, <hi>They ſhould never ſee them again, for they were falſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus they were often troubled and importuned by the Friars, who generally came two at a Time, tho' ſometimes but one. One of theſe often lifted up his Hand to ſtrike them, but did not: For they not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moved by Fear, he was put out of Countenance, and would ſay, <hi>They were good Women, and he would do them any Good.</hi> As indeed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he did work for them, and would ſay, <hi>It was for God's Sake, and that they ought to thank him for it.</hi> To which they replied, <hi>Thoſe that did any Thing for God, did not look for a Reward from Man;</hi> which once made him ſo angry, that he ſaid, <hi>They were the worſt of all Creatures, and they ſhould be uſed worſe than the</hi> Turks, Armenians, <hi>and</hi> Lutherans. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon one of them ſaid, <hi>The pure Life was ever counted the worſt, and if we muſt ſuffer, we are the Lord's, and can truſt him. Do what ye will with us, we do not fear any evil Tidings; we are ſettled and grounded in Truth; and the more ye perſecute us, the ſtronger we grow.</hi> For this they experienced, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, according to what they ſignified in their Letters, tho' they were ſeparated a Year from each other. The Friars coming once to <hi>Sarah,</hi> told her, <hi>If ſhe would, ſhe might go out of the Priſon, and ſay and do nothing.</hi> And ſhe ſaying, <hi>She would on that Account,</hi> They ſaid, they would come next Morning. But <hi>Sarah</hi> perceived their Deceit, and therefore when they came, ſhe, to avoid the Snare, could not reſolve to go forth, tho' the Friars behaved themſelves friendly, and told her that the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had ſaid, <hi>If they wanted Linnen, Woollen, Stockings, Shoes, or Money, they ſhould have it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Once it happened that an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man who lived there, having heard that <hi>Sarah</hi> was in a Room with a Window next the Street, got up by the Wall, and ſpoke a few Words to her; but he was violently haled down, and caſt into Priſon upon Life and Death; for he was one they had taken from the Turks, and made a <hi>Papiſt</hi> of him. The Friars com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them to know whether he had brought them any Letters, they ſaid <hi>No.</hi> Neither had <hi>Katharine</hi> ſeen him; yet it was told them, he was like to be hang'd. Of this <hi>Sarah</hi> gave Information to <hi>Katharine,</hi> by writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a few Lines to her, (for it ſeems they then could not hear one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) and ſhe told her, ſhe thought the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Friars were the chief Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of this Buſineſs. This grieved <hi>Katharine,</hi> and ſhe wrote to <hi>Sarah</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, (for they had a private Way to ſend to each other.) In this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, after her Salutation, ſhe ſaid to <hi>Sarah,</hi> 
               <q>That ſhe might be ſure, the Friars were the chief Actors; but that ſhe believed the Lord would preſerve that poor <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man for his Love, and that ſhe was made to ſeek the Lord for him with Tears: And that ſhe deſired her to ſend him ſomething once a Day, if the Keeper would carry it. That ſhe her ſelf was raviſhed with the Love of God to her Soul, and her

Beloved was the chiefeſt of ten Thouſands; and that ſhe did not fear the Face of any Man, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ho' ſhe felt their Arrows. Moreover that ſhe had a Proſpect of their ſafe Return into <hi>England:</hi> And in the Concluſion, ſhe bid <hi>Sarah</hi> take Heed, if ſhe was tempted with Money.</q> But this Letter, (by what Means they never knew) came to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Friar's Hands, who tranſlating it into <hi>Italian,</hi> delivered it to the Lord Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; and afterwards came with Inquiſitor's Deputy to <hi>Katharine,</hi> and ſhewed her both the Papers, and asked her, <hi>If ſhe could read it? viz</hi> the <hi>English</hi> one. <hi>Yea,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>I writ it, O, did you indeed?</hi> ſaid he. <hi>And what is it you ſay of me here? Nothing but what is true,</hi> replied ſhe. Then he ſaid, <hi>Where is the Paper</hi> Sarah <hi>ſent? Give it, or elſe I will ſearch your Trunk, and every where elſe.</hi> She then bidding him <hi>ſearch where he would,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>She muſt tell him who it was that brought her Ink, or elſe ſhe ſhould be tyed with Chains preſently.</hi> And ſhe returned, <hi>She had done nothing but what was juſt and right in the Sight of God; and what ſhe did ſuffer on that Account would be for Truth's-ſake. And ſhe would not meddle with the poor Workmen.</hi> Then he ſaid, <hi>For Gods-ſake tell me what</hi> Sarah <hi>did write.</hi> And ſhe told him ſomething, and ſaid, what ſhe ſpoke was Truth. <hi>But</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned he, <hi>You ſay it is much we do not tempt you with Money.</hi> And this indeed happened afterwards. The Deputy then took <hi>Katharine</hi>'s Ink, and threw it away; and ſo they went alſo; and the poor <hi>Engliſhman</hi> was releaſed next Morning. They now coming to <hi>Sarah,</hi> told her, <hi>That</hi> Katharine <hi>honeſtly had confeſs'd all, and that ſhe had beſt to confeſs too:</hi> And they threatned her with a Halter, and that they would take away her Bed and Trunk, and her Money too. To which <hi>Sarah</hi> ſaid, <hi>It may be ſhe might not ſend to</hi> Katherine <hi>any more:</hi> And ſhe ask'd the Deputy, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was a Miniſter of Chriſt, or a Magiſtrate? If he were a Magiſtrate,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>he might take her Money, but ſhe would not give it him.</hi> He then grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing angry, ſaid, <hi>She was poſſeſs'd.</hi> To which ſhe reply'd, <hi>If ſo, then it was with the Power of an endleſs Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus from Time to Time they ſuffered many Aſſaults; and ſometimes it ſo happened, that thoſe who came to ſee them, were ſtruck to the Heart, which offended the Friars. Now at length their Money was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt gone, they having ſometimes employ'd it for Victuals. But the Friars told them, <hi>They might have kept their Money for other Services; for they ſhould have maintain'd them whilſt they kept them Priſoners.</hi> To this they ſaid, <hi>They could not keep their Money, and be chargeable to others.</hi> Then it ſo fell out, that their Stomachs were taken away, and they did eat but little for three or four Weeks, till at length they found themſelves obliged to Faſting for ſeveral Days together; which made the Friars ſay, <hi>That it was impoſſible that People could live with ſo little Meat, as they did.</hi> And it was told them, <hi>The Lord Inquiſitor had ſaid, they might have any Thing they would.</hi> To which they ſignifying that it was not in their own Will they faſted, ſaid, <hi>They muſt wait to know the Mind of the Lord, what he would have them to do.</hi> They continued weak, eſpecially <hi>Sarah,</hi> who apprehending her Death near, did therefore dreſs her Head as ſhe would lie in the Grave. They both were ſo feeble that they could not put on their Cloaths, neither put them off, being alſo unable to make their Beds. And tho' they deſired to be together in one Room, yet the Friars would not permit it: In this Condition they concluded they were like to die: But Heaven had provided otherwiſe. <hi>Katharine</hi> about that Time being exerciſed in Supplication to the Lord, that it might pleaſe him to put an End to their Trial, which Way it ſeemed good in his Sight, thought ſhe heard a Voice, ſaying, <hi>Ye ſhall not die,</hi> and ſhe took this to be a Heavenly Voice: And from that Time they felt themſelves refreſhed with the living Preſence of the Lord, to their great Joy and Comfort, ſo that they felt Freedom to eat again; and
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:003104_0307_0FEFF5EAC021A160"/>
then they were provided with good Victuals, but yet they were under a Fear of Eating any Thing which in ſome Reſpect might be counted unclean; and therefore they cried unto the Lord, and ſaid, <hi>We had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther die, than eat any Thing that is polluted and unclean.</hi> And <hi>Katharine</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it was ſaid to her from the Lord, <hi>Thou may'ſt as freely eat, as if thou hadſt wrought for it with thy Hands.</hi> And <hi>Sarah,</hi> who ſometimes had wrought for others in the Inquiſition-Houſe, was perſuaded that it was told her by Inſpiration, <hi>Thou ſhalt eat the Fruit of thy Hands and be bleſſed.</hi> And ſo they did eat, and for eight or ten Days they got what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they did call for. But afterwards they were ſo ſtraitned for want of Food, that it did them more Hurt than their Faſt. Yet they being preſerved alive, the Friars ſaid, <hi>The Lord keeps them alive by his mighty Power, becauſe they ſhould be Catholicks.</hi> To which they returned, <hi>It ſhould be known one day, the Lord had another End in it.</hi> But the Friars told them plainly, <hi>There was no Redemption from them.</hi> Whereupon they ſaid, <hi>With the Lord there was Mercy and plenteous Redemption:</hi> And they bid them, <hi>Take heed ye be not found Fighters againſt God.</hi> To which the Friars return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Ye are fooliſh Women. Then we are,</hi> replied they, <hi>the Lord's Fools; and they are dear and precious in his Sight.</hi> The Friars then ſhewing their ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Crowns, ſaid, that <hi>They were the Lord's Fools;</hi> And pointing at their Gowns, ſaid, <hi>They did wear them for God's-ſake, to be laught at by the World.</hi> One of the Friars about this Time did what he could to ſend <hi>Katharine</hi> to <hi>Rome:</hi> And not ſucceeding, he ſaid they ſhould go both. But this not taking Effect,<note place="margin">A Friar ſent to the Pope with a Charge againſt <hi>Kat. Evans.</hi>

But, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> you have not the true Faith.</hi> To which ſhe anſwer'd, <hi>By Faith we ſtand, and by the Power of God we are upheld. Doſt thou think it is by our own Power and Holineſs we are kept from a vain Converſation, from Sin and Wickedneſs?</hi> He then ſaying, <hi>That was their Pride;</hi> ſhe told him, <hi>We can glory in the Lord; we were Children of Wrath once as well as others; but the Lord hath quickned us that were dead, by the living Word of his Grace, and hath waſhed, cleanſed, and ſanctified us in Soul and Spirit, in Part, according to our Meaſures; and we do preſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward towards that which is perfect.</hi> He then ſaid, <hi>Ye are good Women; but yet there is no Redemption for you, except ye will be</hi> Catholicks. This was the Old Leſſon of the Friars, who at another Time, ſaid, <hi>Ye may be</hi> Catholicks, <hi>and keep your own Religion too, and ye ſhall not he known to be</hi> Catholicks, <hi>except ye were brought before a Juſtice.</hi> To which thay re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, <hi>What, ſhould we profeſs a Chriſt we ſhould be aſham'd of?</hi>

            <p>Sometimes they ſpoke ſo effectually to thoſe that came to them,<note place="margin">The different Effects of their Diſcourſe on different Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</note> that they could not gainſay them, but were made to confeſs that God was with them; tho' others would make a hideous Noiſs, and cry <hi>Jeſu Maria,</hi> and run away as People that were ſtruck with Fear. <hi>Katharine</hi>'s Priſon being ſo near the Street, that ſhe could be heard of thoſe that wen by, ſhe was moved ſometimes to call them to <hi>Repentance, and to turn to the Light wherewith they were enlighten'd, which would lead them out of all their wicked Ways and Works, to ſerve the true and living God in Spirit and in Truth.</hi> This ſo reached ſome, that they did ſigh and groan, and ſtay to hear her; but not long, it being forbidden upon great Pain. Yet ſome that paſſed by to their Worſhip-houſes, were ſo wicked, that they threw Stones at her Window, and often made a ſad Noiſe, and howled like Dogs.</p>
            <p>Thus they were aſſaulted both from abroad, and within Doors, from the Friars, who fiercely threatned them for their bold Teſtimony againſt Idolatry. Once when they ſhewed <hi>Sarah, Mary</hi> and her Babe pictured againſt a Wall, and would have her look upon it; ſhe, to ſhew her Zeal againſt Idol-worſhip, ſtampt with her Foot, and ſaid, <hi>Curſed are all Images, and Image-Makers, and thoſe that fall down to worſhip them.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Once it happened, that ſome <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships came to join with the Cavaliers of <hi>Malta,</hi> to fight againſt the <hi>Turks. Sarah</hi> hearing this, ſaid <hi>God is angry, God is angry; go not forth to kill one another; Chriſt came not to deſtroy Life, but to ſave it.</hi> This ſhe told many, who were perſuaded of obtaining a Victory: But it fell out otherwiſe, for their Fleet was beaten by the <hi>Turks,</hi> and they returned with great Damage.</p>
            <p>A Friar coming once to <hi>Katharine,</hi> ask'd her, <hi>Why ſhe did not work?</hi> Which made her ſay to him, <hi>What Work doſt thou do?</hi> He anſwered, <hi>I write.</hi> To which ſhe return'd, I <hi>ll write too if thou wilt bring me Pen, Ink, and Paper.</hi> But he not willing ſhe ſhould write, ſaid, St. Paul <hi>did work at</hi> Rome; <hi>and by knitting ſhe might get about three Halfpence a Day.</hi> She told him, <hi>If we could have had that Privilege among you, which</hi> Paul <hi>had at</hi> Rome <hi>under</hi> Caeſar, <hi>who was a Heathen Prince, we would have wrought, and not have been chargeable to any; for he lived in his own hired Houſe two Years preaching the Goſpel and Doctrine of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> She ask'd him alſo, <hi>Whether he knew the holy War of God? And if thou knoweſt at,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>then thou canſt but know, that we can't be without Exerciſe Day nor Night.</hi> This ſtopt his Mouth; Beſides, it was well known,<note place="margin">They are not idle in Priſon.</note> that they ſpent not their Time idly; for they knit Stockings for thoſe that were ſervices able to them; they made Garments for the poor Priſoners, and mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their Clothes; tho' they were not willing to work for the Friars, who ſometimes coming to her, kneeled down, and would have <hi>Katha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi> to ſay after them the Words they ſpoke. But this ſhe refuſed to do, tho' it made theſe Men grow more angry. Such and the like Occurrences ſo grieved her, that once in Anguiſh of Spirit ſhe cried out to God, <hi>It were better for me to die than to live thus:</hi> For being almoſt continually conſtrained to teſtify againſt Idolatry and Superſtition, ſhe wou'd have been willing to have laid down her Life for a Teſtimony

againſt it, if it had been required of her. And when once the Friars told her, that <hi>Sarah</hi> was to be carried to <hi>Rome,</hi> whilſt ſhe ſhould ſtay at <hi>Malta,</hi> it ſo grieved her, that with Supplication ſhe ask'd the Lord, <hi>If he did not count her worthy to go to</hi> Rome alſo, and to offer up her Life there for the Teſtimony of Jeſus; becauſe, if ſhe was at Liberty to chuſe, ſhe would rather do ſo, than return without her to England.</p>
            <p>At another Time,<note place="margin">More Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with a Friar.</note> when it was told them, That their Bibles were falſe, <hi>Katharine</hi> ask'd the Friar that ſaid ſo, <hi>Wherein are they falſe?</hi> He replied, <hi>Becauſe the Books of the</hi> Maechabees <hi>were not in them.</hi> To which ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That <hi>tho' ſomething might be wanting, yet the reſt might be good for all that: But if ſomething were added, then the Bible was corrupted.</hi> This ſtruck at ſome Additions ſhe had ſeen in the Bibles there. Then he ask'd her whether ſhe did not think that every one muſt bow at the Name of <hi>Jeſus:</hi> And ſhe anſwering, <hi>Yea,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and bid her to kneel down, or to bow her ſelf. To which ſhe ſaid, <hi>That her Heart and whole Body was bowed down under the Name of Jeſus; but that ſhe would not bow at the Will of him or any Body elſe. He that departs from Iniquity</hi> (thus ſhe continued) <hi>bows before the Name Jeſus; but they that live in Sin and Wickedneſs do not bow before the Son of God.</hi> Then he ſaid, <hi>That he and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions ſtood in the ſame Power, and were led by the ſame Spirit as the Apoſtles;</hi> which made her ask, <hi>Why then they abuſed that Power, and uſed carnal Weapons?</hi> He anſwer'd, <hi>They did not do ſo; for their Inquiſition, nay, even their Chains and Fetters were Spiritual.</hi> Then he ask'd her whether ſhe did not think all thoſe damned that were not of her Perſuaſion: She ſaid, <hi>No; Chriſt hath not taught us ſo; for thoſe that are to Day in a State of Reprobation, the Lord, if it pleaſe him, can call to Morrow out of it.</hi> He then ſaid, <hi>We think you damned, and all thoſe that are not of our Belief.</hi> To which ſhe return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>The Judgment of Man doth not hurt us.</hi> Sometimes ſome came to the Priſon upon their Saints-days, and ask'd them, <hi>What Day it was?</hi> And they not being acquainted with thoſe Saints, would anſwer, <hi>We don't know it.</hi> When the others told them that it was ſuch or ſuch a Saint Day, and that this Saint would puniſh them that Night, becauſe they did not obſerve his Day; They anſwered, <hi>That they knew the Saints to be at Peace with them, and that therefore they did not fear them.</hi> Another Time a Friar came and told them, <hi>It was ſeventeen Days to</hi> Chriſtmas, <hi>and that the Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>conceived that preſent Day.</hi> On which <hi>Katharine</hi> made this pretty Remark, that indeed this was very ſingular, <hi>That ſhe did go with Child but ſeventeen Days.</hi> Such like Occurrences grieved her exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, when ſhe conſidered the groſs Darkneſs theſe People were in: And as ſhe was crying to the Lord in Prayer, that it ſeemed that all their Travel and Labour was fruitleſs, ſhe felt this Anſwer: <hi>Be not grieved tho'</hi> Iſrael <hi>be not gathered; the Seed of</hi> Malta <hi>is to increaſe into Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; that which ye have ſown ſhall not die, but live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After <hi>Katharine</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> had been impriſon'd at <hi>Malta</hi> about three Years,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>D.

But they were unwilling to enter into thoſe Terms, as not knowing what the Lord one Time or other might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of them. <hi>Daniel</hi> ſeeing he could not obtain their Deliverance this Way,<note place="margin">He offers to be impriſoned for them, yea to lay down his Life for their Liberty.</note> offered himſelf to be impriſoned inſtead of them; and this not being accepted, he went yet farther, and ſignified, <hi>That he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to lay down his Life for their Liberty, if it was not to be purchaſed other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</hi> Great Love indeed! of which but few Inſtances are to be found. And they hearing of this, were touched with exceeding great Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. In the mean while he found a Way to get ſome Letters deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered<pb n="301" facs="unknown:003104_0312_0FEFF63161375390"/>
to them, and wrote alſo himſelf both to comfort and exhort them to Stedfaſtneſs. At length he found Means alſo to ſpeak to them; for on a Time as they ſtood at the Priſon-Grates, he being come in their Sight, ſaluted them in theſe Words; <hi>The whole Body of God's Elect, right dearly Beloved, own your Teſtimony, and ye are a ſweet Savour unto the Lord and his People.</hi> To which one of them anſwered, <hi>That it was a Trouble to them that they could not be more ſerviceable.</hi> This made his Heart melt with Pity and Compaſſion, conſidering the wonderful Mercy of the Lord in preſerving them, without fainting in that ſharp Trial. And they beholding one another at a Diſtance thro' the Iron Grates, were mutually refreſhed at that Seaſon. They afterwards wrote to him, and ſignified with the moſt tender Expreſſions, how highly they valued his great Love; and alſo ſent him Letters for their Friends and Relations in <hi>England;</hi> and he neglected, not to write back again to them during his Stay, which was in the Fore-part of the Year 1662.<note place="margin">1662</note> But he was forced to leave them Priſoners there: Yet the Time of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption drew nigh, which was brought about at the Inſtance of <hi>G. Fox</hi> and <hi>Gilbert Latey,</hi> by writing to the Lord <hi>Aubery,</hi> as hath been ſaid already.</p>
            <p>Some Time before <hi>Daniel Baker</hi> came to <hi>Malta,</hi> it had been told them,<note place="margin">All Sorts of Means uſed to pervert them.</note> that if they would turn Catholicks, they might dwell at <hi>Malta.</hi> To which their Anſwer was, That <hi>that they were true</hi> Catholiks. One of the Magiſtrates ſaid that if they would not turn Catholicks, they muſt yet ſuffer long Impriſonment by the Pope's Order. And yet it was not true that there was ſuch an Order. It was alſo told them, if they would kiſs the Croſs, they ſhould be releaſed; and they might ſtay at the Houſe of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſul until an Opportunity offered to carry them to <hi>England.</hi> In the mean while they heard that the Pope had given Order to let them paſs to <hi>England</hi> without doing them any Hurt. But however it was, they were preſerved well contented, and they ſaid reſolutely, that they would not kiſs the Croſs, nor purchaſe their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty at that Rate.<note place="margin">But they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſtedfaſt and inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> It ſeems the Conſul aim'd at ſome Advantage by their Releaſment, for he told them that the Inquiſitor had ſaid, <hi>If any one would engage for three or four thouſand Dollars to be paid if ever they came thither again, they ſhould be ſet at Liberty.</hi> This he ſaid alſo to <hi>D. Baker,</hi> and added, that <hi>if none would engage, they muſt die in Priſon; and that this was the Pope's Order.</hi> After <hi>Baker</hi>'s Departure, Word was ſent to ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants, concerning ſuch an Engagement; but none appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed willing to enter into it; and the Priſoners were ſo far from deſiring, that they ſpoke againſt it. Yet there were many that ſought to obtain their Liberty, ſhewing themſelves willing to engage for what was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, but all their Endeavours were in vain.</p>
            <p>Once they faſted three Days, and tho' it was a cold Seaſon, they ſat upon the Ground, with very little Clothes on, without Stockings or Shoes, having nothing upon their Heads but Aſhes. The Inquiſitors ſeeing it, wondered exceedingly; and <hi>Sarah</hi> began to ſpeak zealouſly againſt Superſtition and Idolatry. And when the Time of their Faſt was expired, <hi>Katharine</hi> compoſed the following Hymn to God.</p>

After <hi>Katharine</hi> had joyfully ſung thus, ſhe went to the Well in the Court, and drank much Water in the Sight of the Priſoners, as did <hi>Sarah</hi> alſo: For they were dry, and <hi>Sarah</hi> waſhing her Head alſo in cold Water, they cry'd out in their Language, <hi>Ye will kill your ſelves, and go to the Devil.</hi> But this they did not fear, neither caught they any Cold, and ſo became a Wonder to others.</p>
            <p>About half a Year after <hi>Daniel Baker</hi> was gone, it came into <hi>Katha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi>'s Heart, that if ſhe could ſpeak with the Inquiſitor, he would grant them their Liberty. And it was not long after that he came to the Inquiſition-Court Chamber, which they hearing, deſired to ſpeak with him, which was granted, and being admitted into his Preſence, they told him, <hi>They had not wronged or defrauded any, but had ſuffered inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently almoſt four Years for Conſcience-ſake,</hi> &amp;c. After this, the Inquiſitor was very courteous to them, and promiſed their Liberty in a few Days, ſaying, <hi>He would ſend for the Conſul, and get him to engage for five hundred Dollars to be paid for them if ever they came again. And in Caſe the Conſul denied this, he would ſend to</hi> Rome <hi>to the Pope, to ſet them at Liberty without any Obligation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not many Days after, the Inquiſitor came with his Lieutenant, the Chancellor, and others, and after ſome Diſcourſe, asked them, <hi>Whether they would return back again to their Husbands and Children, if it were the Will of God?</hi> To which they anſwered, <hi>It was their Intent in the Will of God ſo to do.</hi>

            <p>Being thus ſet at Liberty, they kneeled down, and prayed God never to lay to their Charge what they did unto them, becauſe they knew them not. And then they were delivered into the Conſul's Hands, who told them, that he had engaged for them to get them free; but they could never find that it was true. Now they were kept eleven Weeks at the Conſul's Houſe, before they could get Paſſage from thence. <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine</hi> in the mean while being under a great Concern, becauſe of a Judgment that was impending over the City,<note place="margin">

            <p>This and more ſhe wrote, and delivered to the Conſul to give it to the grand Maſter, and the reſt of the Governours. But the Conſul not being pleaſed with it, threatned her with Impriſonment again. What further became of the Paper,<note place="margin">A dreadful Tempeſt and Earthquake at <hi>Malta.</hi>
               </note> I do not find, but this, that on the 8th of <hi>October</hi> there was great Thunder and Lightning, which ſet on Fire and blew up one of the Powder-houſes about a Mile out of the City, and another Powder-houſe was thrown down; and in the City five Houſes were overthrown, moſt of the Glaſs Windows of the Palaces and other Houſes broke, the Doors lifted off their Hooks, the Walls torn, and the whole City terribly ſhaken, ſo that being at Midnight, a Cry went up thro' the whole City, and the Bells were rung. At the Bed's Feet where <hi>Katharine</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> lay, was a Glaſs Window, which alſo was broken, but they received no Hurt, tho' the Houſe was ſo ſhaken, that they did exceedingly fear and quake; but being given up unto the Lord to live or to die, their Fear was ſoon taken from them, and turned into Joy in the Lord.<note place="margin">The Conſul viſits them.</note> When it was Day, the Conſul came to them, and they being ſtill and quiet, he asked whether they were not dead. And while he was ſpeaking, others came in, telling what was done in the City; and he told them that even the Ships in the Harbour had ſuffered Damage. Then they ſaid, <hi>One Woe is paſt, and behold another Woe cometh quickly, if ye do not repent.</hi>

               <hi>Sarah</hi> faſted, ſitting upon the Ground with Aſhes upon her Head, her Neck and Shoulders bare, and ſhe ſpoke to the Conſul to deſire the Grand Maſter <hi>to proclaim a Faſt, and to make the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to meet together to wait upon the Lord, with their Minds turned to him; that ſo he might turn away his Judgments from them; for the Hour of his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments was come, wherein the painted Harlot ſhould be ſtripped naked, and receive a Cup of Trembling from the Hand of the Lord.</hi> The Conſul performed this Meſſage to the Magiſtrates; and the Friars ſaid, the Women had a good Intent. Some Time after, the Inquiſitor came, and talking with them, ſaid, <hi>Your Intent is good, but the Devil hath deceived you.</hi> And they asked him, <hi>Whether the Devil could give Power over Sin?</hi> To which he ſaid, <hi>The Devil could transform himſelf into an Angel of Light.</hi> This they aſſented to, but yet ſaid, <hi>He could not hide himſelf from the Children of Light; tho' they that were in the dark could not diſcern him.</hi> He could not abide to hear this, but went away, and the Conſul, who was preſent, wrought againſt them to get them into Bondage again, but in vain. Many now died in the Town of a violent Fever: Whether any other Diſaſter followed upon their Prediction, I can't tell.</p>
            <p>At length there came one of the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Frigates,<note place="margin">They go aboard an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Frigate, as do ſome Knights of <hi>Malta,</hi> and the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's Brother, who is kind to them.</note> called the <hi>Saphire,</hi> commanded by Captain <hi>Samuel Titſwel,</hi> who took them in, together with ſome Knights of <hi>Malta,</hi> among which was the Inquiſitor's Brother, who often ſpoke to the Captain, that they might not want any Thing that was in the Ship, and he told them, <hi>If they came to</hi> Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta <hi>again, they ſhould not be perſecuted ſo.</hi> And to the Captain he ſaid, <hi>If they go to Heaven one Way, and we another, yet we ſhall all meet together at laſt.</hi> But they told him, that <hi>Chriſt Jeſus, the Light of the World, was the only Way to the Father.</hi>

            <p>Departing from <hi>Malta,</hi> after ſome Time they came to <hi>Leghorn,</hi> where the Merchants ſhewed them great Kindneſs, and ſent Wine and other Things for their Refreſhment, proffering them alſo Money; but they were unwilling to accept it.

They alſo went to the Governor, who was courteous to them, and took their Admonitions in good Part, and promiſed to follow their Counſel. And he would have given them Money; but they took none, tho' they accepted his Love: For he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that none of the Garriſon ſhould abuſe them either in Word or Deed, upon pain of ſevere Puniſhment. Yet the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> were ready enough to have done them a Miſchief. They being inclined to go out to the <hi>Moors,</hi> deſired the Governour to let them go forth; but he told them, they muſt expect from that ſavage People nothing but cruel Death or Bonds for ever. And tho' they ſignified to him, that they believed the Lord would preſerve them, ſince they were perſuaded that he required of them to go to the <hi>Moors,</hi> yet the Governor in a friendly Manner with-held them from going. Being thus ſtopt, they believed that the Lord accepted of their Good-will. When they went aboard again, tho' in another Ship, ſeveral took Shipping with them, from a Belief that on their Account they ſhould have a ſafe Paſſage. The Captain, and others that were in the Ship behaved themſelves very civilly towards them; and tho' they met with Tempeſts, yet at length they arrived ſafely in <hi>England.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Katharine</hi> afterwards related, that when (in the Inquiſition) ſhe was for many Days together in Expectation that they ſhould be burnt, ſhe ſaw in a Dream in the Night a large Room and a great Wood-Fire, in the Chimney; and ſhe beheld one ſitting in a Chair by the Fire, in the Form of a Servant, whom ſhe took to be the eternal Son of God. Likewiſe ſhe ſaw a very amiable well-favoured Man-child ſitting in a hollow Chair over the Fire, (not appearing to be above three Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of a Year old, and having no Cloaths on but a little fine Linnen about the upper Parts) and the Fire flamed about it; yet the Child played and was merry. She would then have taken it up, for fear it ſhould have been burnt; but he that ſat in the Chair bid her let it alone. Then turning about, ſhe ſaw an Angel, and he that ſat in the Chair bid her take up the Child, which ſhe did, and found it had no Harm. And then awaking, ſhe told her Dream to <hi>Sarah,</hi> and deſired her not to fear, ſince the heavenly Hoſt thus followed them.</p>
            <p>I have collected this Relation of the Occurrences of theſe Women at <hi>Malta</hi> from ſeveral Papers and Letters, which not long after their Return Home, were publiſhed in Print. And ſince no due Order was obſerved there, and many things mentioned, which to avoid Prolixity, I have paſt by, as not very material, I may have haply miſs'd in ſome Caſe or other, as to the Order or Series of Time, but yet I think the Matters of Fact are not mutilated. Now to give the Reader an Idea of the Frame of theſe Womens Minds and their Sufferings, I'll inſert ſome of their Letters. Among thoſe which they writ to their Friends in <hi>England,</hi> was this following;</p>

and he hath had as tender a Care over us, as he hath had of any of his Lambs which he hath called forth in this the Day of his Power, and hath carried us thro' and over as great Afflictions as moſt of our Brethren and Sufferers for his Name, both in Mockings, Scoffings, Scornings, Reproaches, Stripes, Contradictions, Perils at Land, and Perils at Sea, fiery Trials, cruel Threatnings, Grief of Heart, Sorrow of Soul, Heats and Colds, Faſtings and Watchings, Fears within, and Fightings without, terrible Temptations and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, and dreadful Impriſonments and Buffetings of Satan; yet in all theſe our Trials the Lord was very gracious unto us, and did not abſent himſelf from us, neither ſuffered his Faithfulneſs to fail us, but did bear us up, and keep us from fainting in the Midſt of our Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. We had not another to make our Moan to, but the Lord alone, neither could we expect a Drop of Mercy, Favour or Refreſhment, but what he did diſtil from his living Preſence, and work by his own Strength; for we ſat one in one Room, and the other in another, near a Year; as Owls in Deſarts, and as People forſaken in ſolitary Places. Then did we enjoy the Preſence of the Lord, and did behold the Brightneſs of his Glory, and we did ſee you, our dear Friends, in the Light of Jeſus, and did behold your Order, and Stedfaſtneſs of your Faith and Love to all Saints, and were refreſhed in all the Faithful-hearted, and felt the Iſſues of Love and Life which did ſtream from the Hearts of thoſe that were wholly joined to the Fountain, and were made ſenſible of the Benefit of your Prayers.</q>

            <p>O the Sorrows, the Mournings, the Tears! But thoſe that ſow in Tears, ſhall reap in Joy. A true Sorrow begets a true Joy; and a true Croſs, a true Crown: For when our Sorrows did abound, the Love of God did abound much more: The deeper the Sorrows, the greater the Joys; the greater the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Dear Friends and Brethren, marvel not that <hi>Iſrael</hi> is not gathered, our Judgment remains with the Lord, and ſo do our Labours; for it was not for Want of Travel, nor Pain, nor Love to their Souls; for we could have been contented to have fed upon the Graſs on the Ground, ſo we might have had our Freedom amongſt them: For, had it not been for the great Oppoſition, they would have followed after us, as Chickens after a Hen, both great and ſmall. But oh the ſwelling Seas, the raging and foaming Waves, ſtormy Winds and Floods, and deep Waters, and high Mountains and Hills, hard Rocks, rough Ways, and crooked Paths, tall Cedars, ſtrong Oaks, fruitleſs Trees, and corrupted ones, that cumber the Ground, and hinder the righteous Seed to be ſown, and the noble Plants from being planted: Oh! they ſhut up the Kingdom againſt the Simple-hearted, and hide the Key of Knowledge from the innocent ones, and will not enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom themſelves, nor ſuffer them that would enter, but ſtir up the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates to form carnal Weapons, thinking to prevent the Lord of taking to him his Inheritance, and to diſpoſſeſs his Son, who is Heir of all, that he might not have a Dwelling-place among them, nor a Habitation nigh them; becauſe that his Light will diſcover their Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and his Brightneſs will burn up all their Abominations, and marr their Beauty, and ſtain their Glory, their Pomp, and their Pride, that it may periſh as the untimely Figs, and fall as the Flower of the Field, and wither as the Graſs upon the Houſe-top. Oh, the Belly of Hell, the Jaws of Satan, the whole Myſtery of Iniquity is at the Height, and all Manner of Abomination that makes deſolate, ſtands where it ought not, and is upholden by a Law, That upon Pain of Death none muſt ſpeak againſt it, nor walk contrary to it.

My Tongue cannot expreſs, neither hath it entred into the Heart of Man, to conceive of the Things that God hath laid up for them that fear him.</p>
                  <p>Therefore doth my Soul breathe to my God for thee and my Children, Night and Day, that your Minds may be joined to the Light of the Lord Jeſus, to lead you out of Satan's Kingdom, into the Kingdom of God, where we may enjoy one another in the Life eternal, where neither Sea nor Land can ſeparate; in which Light and Life do I ſalute thee my dear Husband, with my Children, wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you to embrace God's Love, in making his Truth ſo clearly manifeſt amongſt you; whereof I am a Witneſs, even of the everlaſting Fountain that hath been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened by the Meſſengers of Chriſt, who preach to you the Word of God, in Seaſon and out of Seaſon, directing you where you may find your Saviour to purge and cleanſe you from your Sins, and to reconcile you to his Father, and to have <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity with him and all the Saints, in the Light, that ye may be Fellow-Citizens in the Kingdom of Glory, Reſt and Peace, which Chriſt hath purchaſed for them that love him, and obey him. What Profit is there for to gain the whole World, and loſe your own Souls? Seek firſt the Kingdom of God and the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof, and all other Things ſhall be added to you. Godlineſs is great Gain, having the Promiſe of this Life that now is, and that which is to come; which is fulfilled to me, who have taſted of the Lord's endleſs Love and Mercies to my Soul; and from a moving of the ſame Love and Life do I breathe to thee my Dear Husband, with my Children; my dear Love ſalutes you all; my Prayers to my God are for you all, that your Minds may be joined to the Light, wherewith you are lightned, that I may enjoy you in that which is eternal, and have Communion with you in the Spirit. He that is joined to the Lord, is one Spirit, one Heart, one Mind, one Soul, to ſerve the Lord with one Conſent. I cannot by Pen nor Paper ſet forth the large Love of God in fulfilling his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Promiſes to me in the Wilderneſs, being put into Priſon for God's Truth, there to remain all Days of my Life, being ſearched, tried, examined upon pain of Death among the Enemies of God and his Truth; ſtanding in Jeopardy for my Life until the Lord had ſubdued and brought them under by his mighty Power, and made them to feed us, and would have given us Money or Clothes; but the Lord did deck our Table richly in the Wilderneſs.

Several other Letters both ſhe and <hi>Katharine</hi> writ to their Husbands, Friends, and Relations. But ſince great Part of my Narrative was fetch'd from thence, I paſs them by. But by theſe inſerted, one may ſee that they were not Women of a dull Temper, but ingenious and chearful.</p>
            <p>In a Letter of <hi>Sarah</hi>'s to her Friends in <hi>Ireland,</hi> I find theſe Words:</p>
            <p>
               <q>My Life is given up to the Service of the Lord: Bonds, Chains, Bolts, Irons, double Doors, Death it ſelf is too little for the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Jeſus, and for the Word of God; ſo the Seed be gathered, it is but a reaſonable Sacrifice. Bonds and Afflictions beſide the Goſpel of Chriſt. Thoſe that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, muſt ſuffer Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q> And in a Letter to <hi>Daniel Baker, Katharine</hi> ſaid,</p>
            <p>
               <q>The Time is too little for me to diſcloſe the twentieth Part of the terrible Trials; but whenſoever we were brought upon any Trial, the Lord did take away all Fear from us, and multiplied our Strength, and gave us Power and Boldneſs to plead for the Truth of the Lord Jeſus, and Wiſdom of Words to ſtop the Mouths of the Gainſayers; but then they would ſay, <hi>We had not the true Faith, but we had all Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</hi> Dearly beloved, pray for us, that we fall not, nor fail, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our Enemies may have any Advantage to rejoice, and ſay, we ſerved a God that could not ſave us, and called upon a God that could not deliver us; as if we were like them, to call upon Stocks, Stones, Pictures, and painted Walls, and dead Things, that cannot hear, ſee, nor ſpeak. We do beſeech thee to tell all our dear Friends, Fathers and Elders, the Pillars of the ſpiritual Building, with all the reſt of our Chriſtian Brethren, that we do deſire their Prayers, for we have need of them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Letter they concluded with the following Poem:</p>

               <l>HOW ſtrong and pow'rful is our KING,</l>
               <l>To all that do believe in him?</l>

               <l>Our Sorrows none can learn nor read,</l>
               <l>But thoſe that in our Bath do tread.</l>
            </lg>

               <l>But he whoſe Beauty ſhineth bright,</l>
               <l>Who turneth Darkneſs into Light,</l>
               <l>Makes Cedars bow, and Oaks to bend</l>
               <l>To him, that's ſent to the ſame End;</l>
               <l>He is a Fountain pure and clear,</l>
               <l>His Chriſtal Streams run far and near,</l>
               <l>To cleanſe all thoſe that come to him,</l>
               <l>For to be healed of their Sin.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>All them that patiently abide,</l>
               <l>And never ſwerve nor go aſide;</l>
               <l>The Lord will free them out of all</l>
               <l>Bondage, Captivity and Thrall.</l>

And therefore they would have given them the <hi>Mittimus,</hi> to carry it themſelves to the Jailor. This they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed; tho' ſometimes ſome of their Friends had done ſo: For the Conſtables had ſuch Experience of their Fidelity, that they durſt truſt them even in ſuch a Caſe, without fearing the Bird would eſcape.

Yet they rid with him thro' the Country, being five in Number, and ſome carried their Bibles open in their Hands, and paſſing thro' Towns, they told People, <hi>They were the Priſoners of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, going to ſuffer Bonds for his Name's-ſake.</hi> Being come to <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> and gone into an Inn, the Maſter of the Houſe ſeemed ſomewhat troubled that they ſhould go to Priſon; but they being unwilling to conſult with Lawyers, to which they were adviſed, ſuffered themſelves to be had to Priſon;<note place="margin">

But then it was told the Priſoners, the Jailor would not ſuffer them to fetch any Drink out of the Town into the Priſon; but what Beer they drank, they muſt take it of him, and that, as was eaſily to be gueſs'd, ſhould be at a dear Rate.</p>
            <p>This made <hi>G.

So long as <hi>G.

Whereupon he was called up, and to try whether he was a <hi>Quaker,</hi> the Oath was alſo tendered to him, and he took it; thus the Snare intended againſt him did not hold.</p>

                  <hi>E.

Having treated of this Matter at large, he laid down the State of their Way of Meeting and Worſhip, appealing to others on this Account, with theſe Words:</p>
            <q>
               <p>What Judgment do our Neighbours give in this Caſe? they ſay,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>E.

               <p>And as for the Manner of our meeting and ſitting together, it is orderly and decently, and of good Report among Men; and for any Doctrine that ever was there held, or heard by any, none can truly accuſe it to be either Error, or Hereſy, or Sedition; but on the contrary, they know it witneſſeth againſt all Sin and Iniquity, and tends to the turning of People from Ungodlineſs and Unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to Truth and Holineſs: And many can tell, this is effected, by our Doctrine, preached in our Meetings; and our Neighbours can witneſs, that we part again in Peace and good Order, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Time; and they can ſhew you, they are not terrified, nor the Peace of the Land diſturbed (on our Part) by our Meetings, which are in God's Fear, and to the Glory of his Name, which all Sober Men know, are according to the Law of God, and Goſpel, and primitive Chriſtian Example.</p>
               <p>We are accuſed as heinous Offenders, and impriſoned, becauſe 'tis ſuppoſed, <hi>We do not ſubmit to obey the known Laws of the Land, but break them, and will not conform to the Church, pay Tithes, take Oaths, have Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings together,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>tho' we know the Laws of the Land command thoſe Things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="320" facs="unknown:003104_0331_0FEFF60D94D47948"/>
                  <hi>Plea,</hi> Firſt, As to ſubmitting to all known Laws of the Land; this is known to God and our Neighbours, that our Principle and Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice is, and ever hath been, to ſubmit to every Government, and to ſubmit to all Laws of Men, either by doing or by ſuffering, as at this Day, we reſiſt not the greateſt of Afflictions and Tribulations that can be impoſed on us; and this is well known to our Neighbours and all People, that we are ſubmiſſive to all Laws of Men, by patient ſuffering without Reſiſtance; even when any Law requires any Thing of us which we cannot perform for Conſcience-ſake, that Law we fulfil by patient Suffering, reſiſting no Man, nor rendring Evil for Evil to any. And the Judgment of the Scriptures which are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to both Law and Goſpel, and the Precedents of Saints juſtify us in this Caſe, in chuſing patiently to ſuffer the greateſt Penalties of the Law, rather than to obey (by doing) any ſuch Law as requires things contrary to our pure Conſciences; as in the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the three Children, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. who were commanded, <hi>To fall down and worſhip the golden Image, at what Time ſoever they heard the Sound of the Muſick, upon the Penalty of being caſt into the midſt of the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fiery Furnace:</hi> which Commandment they could not obey, nor could they fall down to worſhip the Image; but rather chuſed to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Penalty of being caſt into the midſt of the burning fiery Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, which accordingly was done unto them. Again, in the Caſe of <hi>Daniel,</hi> chap. 6. who was commanded, <hi>To make no Petition to any God or Man for thirty Days, ſave to King</hi> Darius, <hi>upon the Penalty and Affliction of being caſt into the Lyon's Den:</hi> But <hi>Daniel</hi> did rather chuſe to ſuffer the Penalty, to be caſt into the Den of Lyons, than to obey the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and was caſt into the Lion's Den. By theſe Examples of holy Men, with many more that might be given out of the Scriptures, 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, <hi>That righteous Men will rather chuſe to ſuffer, than to obey any Law of Man contrary to their Conſciences.</hi> So the Law of God, and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Saints, and holy Scriptures give Judgment for us in this Caſe, of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ather chuſing to ſuffer, than to obey Laws contrary to our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences; and conſequently muſt needs condemn ſuch that perſecute and impriſon us, becauſe they require Obedience of us in Things againſt our Conſciences.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Tho' we diſobey Laws, and cannot actively obey every Law of Man, when it requireth and commandeth Things contrary to a good Conſcience, yet herein alſo are we juſtified, by the Law of God, Example of Saints, and holy Scriptures, and they give Judgment for us, and conſequently againſt our Enemies in this Caſe; and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in the two Examples before-mentioned in <hi>Daniel,</hi> the three Children were expreſly commanded, <hi>to fall down and worſhip the golden Image;</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> was alſo required by the King's Decree, <hi>Not to pray to any God or Man, ſave to King</hi> Darius; yet all theſe holy Men of God did abſolutely diſobey the Law and Decree ſo requiring of them, and did contrary to the Commandment; for the three Children did not bow, nor <hi>Daniel</hi> ceaſe to pray to God, but prayed as at other Times, and yet were juſtified of God in ſo doing. Alſo, the Apoſtles of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt (<hi>Acts</hi> 4.18.) were commanded, <hi>to preach no more in the Name of Jeſus;</hi> but the Apoſtles did diſobey their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, and went on and preached in the Spirit and Power of Chriſt, contrary to the Commandment of the Rulers, and appealed to them, <hi>Whether it were not bet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er to obey God than Man?</hi> Many Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples we might collect out of the Scriptures, that the Servants of God did diſobey the Commands of Kings and Rulers, and could not obey (by doing) any Command contrary to God; but rather chooſed to ſuffer Afflictions, and Death it ſelf, than to obey ſuch Laws and Decrees,
<pb n="321" facs="unknown:003104_0332_0FEFF64B0809ADA0"/>
as required any Thing contrary to a pure Conſcience: And this is our Caſe at this Day; we cannot obey (by doing) any Thing againſt our Conſciences, but muſt break the Laws of Men, and diſobey their Commandments, rather than break the Law of God, and ſin againſt our own Conſciences, whatſoever we ſuffer becauſe hereof; and yet the Examples of Saints and Scriptures juſtify us in this Behalf.</p>
               <p>And let all our Enemies ceaſe to cry out, <hi>Rebellious and diſobedient to Laws and Government;</hi> for we are not ſuch as do wilfully and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately diſobey any Laws of Men, but for Conſcience-ſake, and that we may not ſin againſt God, nor offend his Witneſs in us; therefore we cannot obey Laws contrary to our Conſciences, whatſoever we ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, which we reſiſt not, nor rebel againſt any in this Caſe: So that our Principles and Practices are to obey every Law and Government, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by doing, or ſuffering. And tho' we diſobey ſuch Laws as are not according to the Law of God, and rather do chuſe to ſuffer, yet herein we are juſtified by the Law of God, and the holy Scriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> And as for our Converſations among Men, in Reſpect of our daily Walking and Converſe with them in our Dealing, in Reſpect of Honeſty, and Faithfulneſs, and Truth, and Juſtneſs in Works and Words, our Neighbours ſhall give, Witneſs for us: We will not juſtify our ſelves, 'tis God that juſtifies us, and the Law of God, Goſpel of Chriſt, Scriptures, Examples of holy Men, our Neighbours, and the Witneſs of God in all Mens Conſciences, ſhall bear Witneſs to us; and all theſe do give Judgment for us in theſe Caſes, to whom we do appeal for Judgment. And, <hi>O Lord God everlaſting, do thou judge our Cauſe; do thou make it manifeſt in thy due Seaſon to all the World, that we are thy People, that we love thee above all, that we fear thy Name more than all, that we love Righteouſneſs, and hate Iniquity, and that we now ſuffer for thy holy Name and Truth, and for thy Honour and Juſtice, and for thy Truth and Holineſs: O Lord, thou knoweſt we are reſolved to periſh, rather than to loſe one Grain hereof.</hi> Amen, Amen.</p>
               <p>Our Accuſations and Anſwers truly compared, and weighed in the Balance of Juſtice and Truth in every Man's Conſcience, let all the World judge of the Caſe: Do we deſerve to be ruin'd, deſtroy'd, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon'd, and baniſh'd, and that to be devour'd of wild Beaſts, as our Enemy threatens us he will do? Is it ſo? Are we Hereticks? Are we ſeditious? Are we Drunkards? Are we Double-dealers? Are we ſuch as the Law of God condemns? What Evil have we done in the Land? Do we hurt any Body? Are we not innocent before the Lord and Men? We appeal to the juſt Witneſs of God and Men, let it be anſwered; and tho' no Man will hear and conſider our Cauſe this Day, yet the Lord will plead our Cauſe in his Time and Seaſon, and make the World to know, <hi>We are his People;</hi> in the mean Time we are willing to ſuffer the Reproaches of ungodly Men, till the Lord works Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in the Earth.</p>
               <p>But now it may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> objected by the Magiſtrates and Rulers, <hi>That we have now a Law againſt you, and you muſt ſuffer, for we cannot but put the Law in Execution, according to our Oaths and Offices; and it is not we that perſecute you, but it is the Law of the Land by which you now ſuffer; and we cannot be blamed for your Suffering, we only execute the Law.</hi> And after this Manner is the Reaſoning of ſome at this Day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To all which I do anſwer: It is true, there is a Law <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> enacted againſt us, which is pretendedly made the Ground of our Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering; but whether that Law be in it ſelf juſt, or unjuſt, I ſhall not now demonſtrate, but ſhall leave it to the Judgment of all Chriſtian Men that know us, our Principles, Doctrines, Ways, and Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and let them judge whether we deſerve the Penalties and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments,
<pb n="322" facs="unknown:003104_0333_0FEFF60FEE23C868"/>
therein deſcrib'd, for any Principle or Practice hold or main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by us. And tho' there be a Law againſt us, yet the Magiſtrates that are Executors thereof, may execute the ſame with Moderation or with Violence, with Diſcretion or too much Rigour; and it will be well for them to uſe Moderation and Diſcretion in this Caſe: Hereby may they ſave themſelves from that Weight of Anger and Indignation of the Lord God, that will come upon all violent Doers, who ſeek to deſtroy the Innocent, and rejoice in the Occaſion adminiſtred.</p>
               <p>And tho' this Law be enacted againſt Meetings, not ours, I may ſay; but ſuch Meetings as are dangerous to the publick Peace, and to the Terror of the People: But our Meetings are not ſuch, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Law may not juſtly extend in its Execution to the Breaking of our Meetings, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And tho' this Law is pretended againſt us, for to baniſh us, and to rid the Land of us, as ſome vainly ſuppoſe; yet, muſt it needs be executed to the Height of it without Limitation or Reſtriction? Muſt this Law be executed to its Height more than ſome other Laws, that are as truly enacted, and as fully in Force as this Act can be? Yet ſome ſuch Laws there are, which better deſerve Execution than this, yet they lie <hi>dormant,</hi> as is viſibly apparent at this Day, as in 4 <hi>Jac.</hi>

                  </gap>o as to puniſh them for Breach of the Laws, for the preventing of theſe Evils: But ſuch Wickedneſs is too much ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, tho there be divers Acts of Parliament againſt ſuch Perſons and ſuch Actions, as well as there is one againſt our Meetings; yet the Act againſt us is more put in Execution in ſome Places for the breaking of our Meetings, which are for the Worſhip of God, than the good Laws for ſuppreſſing Wickedneſs, tho' there is better Law for the one than for the other. Divers other Laws and Statutes made for good Ends, for the ſuppreſſing of Wickedneſs in the Land, there are, which are but eaſily executed at this Day: But here is one Act againſt peaceable meeting together for the Worſhip of God, which is violently proſecuted and executed upon innocent Men; and let all juſt Man judge of theſe Things: Tho' there be a Law enacted againſt our Meetings, ſo there is againſt Drunkards and Drunkenneſs, and unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Tippling in Taverns and Alehouſes; and againſt Minſtrels Fidlers, Pipers and Players, Common Players and Stage-Players, that go up and down the Countries, and have their Play-houſes in publick Cities; which Statutes ought rather to be executed, tho' they are not: But theſe Things we ſhall leave to all ſober People to judge of.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing that the Law againſt us is more put in Execution, than theſe other Laws, it doth appear, That there is more Envy againſt us, and our peaceable religious Meetings, than there is againſt Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Wickedneſs, Drunkenneſs and Stage-playing, and ſuch like; and ſuch Magiſtrates, whereſoever they are, are not excuſable in the Sight of God, tho' there is a Law againſt us, while they proſecute it againſt us, and not theſe other good Laws againſt prophane and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Perſons and Practices: And therefore ſeeing we do ſuffer, we muſt ſay, <hi>It is not only becauſe there is a Law againſt us;</hi> but it is alſo, or rather, <hi>Becauſe there is Enmity, and Wrath, and Wickedneſs in the Hearts of Men againſt us,</hi> which is the main Cauſe of our Sufferings at this Day.</p>

            <p>Thus was <hi>E.

            <p>Cruel indeed was this Order; becauſe to whip theſe three tender Women thro' eleven Towns, with Ten Stripes a-piece at each Place, thro' a length of near eighty Miles, in bitter cold Weather, would have been enough to have beaten their Bones bare, and their Lives out of their Bodies.</p>

            <p>Theſe three Women being thus unexpectedly releaſed, went to <hi>New Quechawanah,</hi> where they had a Meeting, and <hi>Shubal Drummer</hi> the Prieſt of the Place, came alſo thither, and ſat quiet.

            <p>Not long after, theſe Women returned to <hi>Dover,</hi> to viſit their Friends; and being in a Meeting the next Firſt-day of the Week, the Conſtables, <hi>Thomas Roberts,</hi> and his Brother <hi>John,</hi> ruſhed in, and laid Hands on <hi>Alice Ambroſe</hi> as ſhe was in Prayer, and taking her, one by the one Arm, and the other by the other, they dragg'd her out of Doors, almoſt a Mile, with her Face towards the Snow, which was near Knee deep, over Stumps and old Trees, having put on their old Clothes, on purpoſe not to dirty their better Suits.<note place="margin">They are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain ſeized at <hi>Dover,</hi> and dragg'd about in a barbarous Manner.</note> Then they lock'd her up in a certain Houſe, and ſo went back to fetch <hi>Mary Tomkins,</hi> whom they dragg'd in the ſame Manner; which their Father, old <hi>Thomas Roberts</hi> ſeeing, lamented, and cry'd, <hi>Wo that ever I was Father to ſuch wicked Children.</hi> But they ſeem'd not to matter what their Father ſaid, who had been a Member of the Church at <hi>Dover</hi> above twenty Years; but becauſe he no longer frequented their Worſhip for their Degeneracy, they took away his Cow, which, with its Milk, helpt to ſupport him and his Wife. <hi>Mary Tomkins</hi> being brought into the Houſe where <hi>Alice</hi> was, <hi>Anne Coleman,</hi> was alſo fetch'd. Next Morning they got a Canoe, and threatned the Women, <hi>They would now do with them, that they ſhould be troubled with them no more;</hi> by which Saying, they ſeem'd to ſignify, that they would give them up to the Mercy of the Sea; which made the Women unwilling to go to the Water-ſide. Then one <hi>Edward Weymouth</hi> took <hi>Mary</hi> by the Arms, and dragg'd her on her Back over the Stumps of Trees, down a very ſteep Hill; by which ſhe was much bruiſed, and often dyed away.

But the wicked Intention of theſe Men was ſtopt by a Power from on high, for on a ſudden a great Tempeſt aroſe, ſo that they brought the Women back again to the Houſe, and about Midnight they turn'd them all out of Doors in the Snow, the Weather being ſo froſty, that <hi>Alice</hi>'s Clothes were frozen like Boards.

But he telling them, That <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had been with the King, and that ſhe had Liberty from him to come thither to buy her a Houſe, this ſo puzzled theſe ſnarling Perſecutors, that they found themſelves at a Loſs, and thus were ſtopt from ſeizing the Maſter's Goods.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Elizabeth</hi> being come to <hi>Boſton,</hi> notwithſtanding the Rulers, went to them, and ſignified that ſhe came thither <hi>to buy a Houſe for her ſelf to live in.</hi> She was four Times at the Court for that Purpoſe, but it was denied her: And tho' ſhe ſaid, <hi>That this Denial would give her Occaſion, if ſhe went to</hi> England <hi>again, to lay it before the King,</hi> it was in vain, and had no Influence upon them.</p>

yet they were ſent to the Houſe of Correction, with Order to be whipt.

            <p>Here we ſee the Religion of theſe Men,<note place="margin">Fruits of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs.</note> who once were ſo preciſe, that they would not join with the Worſhip of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But it ſeems not improbable that they fell away to this Hardneſs of Heart, becauſe being convinced in their Underſtandings of ſome ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Ceremonies that were yet remaining in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> they were not faithful to teſtify againſt thoſe Things, and to ſet their Light on the Candleſtick; but that to ſhun the Croſs, and avoid Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, they choſe to go into a ſtrange Country. And yet they were ſo preſumptuous as to ſay, They were the pureſt Church on Earth, and their Magiſtrates and Preachers were very godly Men. And it may be, ſome of their cruel Executioners, ſeeing how their Magiſtrates (as hath been ſaid of <hi>Thomas Daufort)</hi> did glory in Cruelty, have been fooliſh enough to perſwade themſelves, that their exceſſive Whipping was ſome kind of meritorious Work. But whatever theſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> People thought, they were worſe than others. For in ſome Places of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi> lived alſo <hi>Swedes,</hi> who in regard of their Worship were no leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> than of old the <hi>Samaritans</hi> by the <hi>Jews:</hi> And yet theſe <hi>Swedes</hi> entertained the <hi>Quakers,</hi> when they came amongſt them, far better than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> did; and thus they made it appear that they ſurpaſſed them in Life, if not in Profeſſion. But the preciſe <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Men ſeemed to place great Virtue in a ſturdy Severity, of which the following is an Inſtance.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Dutchman,</hi> an <hi>Oſtender</hi> whoſe Name was <hi>John Laurence,</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted for Adultery, and brought before the Court at <hi>Boſton,</hi> where the Governor <hi>John Endicot</hi> asked him, <hi>Whether he was guilty or not guilty?</hi> To which the Priſoner, who, as it ſeems ſpoke but bad <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſaid, <hi>No Guilt.</hi> On which <hi>Endicot</hi> ſaid in a ſcoffing Manner, <hi>No Gelt; There's no Money:</hi> For <hi>Gheld</hi> ſignifies Money in <hi>Dutch.</hi> Thus the <hi>Dutchman</hi>'s Words and Meaning were ſcoffingly perverted; and tho' there was no clear Evidence againſt him, yet he was condemned to be hang'd. But he denying the Fact, the Execution was deferred; and in the mean while the Prieſts <hi>John Wilſon,</hi> and <hi>James Mayo</hi> came to him in Priſon, to ſee what they could get out of him; and <hi>Mayo</hi> told him, <hi>His Time was near at an End, and that he muſt ſhortly die; and therefore he would have him now to confeſs.</hi> To which the Priſoner returned, <hi>What will you have me to confeſs, that which I never did?</hi> But <hi>Mayo</hi> did not deſiſt, but ſaid, <hi>Confeſs my Son, and give Glory to God.</hi> Yet the Priſoner continued in denying the Charge, and affirmed, he was <hi>clear.</hi> But ſaid the Prieſt, <hi>You cannot be clear,</hi> for our Lord and Saviour ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever looketh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a fair Woman, and luſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

compaſſing a falſe End. But the <hi>Dutchman</hi> ſeeing how they came to betray him, was cautious; and at length after a long and tedious Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, found Means to break Priſon, and thus eſcaped from thoſe who grew accuſtomed to be mercileſs; ſo that ſometimes others as well as <hi>Quakers,</hi> felt the Weight of their Severity.</p>
            <p>As it happened,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>E.

And Information being given that theſe People did ſometimes ſhew Love to thoſe they called <hi>curſed Quakers,</hi> they were all three fetch'd from their Habitation at <hi>Salem,</hi> and carried to <hi>Boſton,</hi> and were tried for their Lives, meerly on Suſpicion; but nothing of Murder was proved againſt them; yet the Mother was fined a great Sum, and her two Sons were ſentenced to ſtand under the Gallows certain Hours, with Ropes about their Necks, and to be whipt in the Market-place, which was performed accordingly. And becauſe theſe young Men were not daunted, Prieſt <hi>Wilſon</hi> ſtanding by, ſaid, <hi>Ah curſed Generation.</hi> And at <hi>Salem</hi> they were whipt alſo, which was done ſo mercileſly, that one of the young Men ſunk down, or died away under the Torture, tho' he was raiſed up, and came to Life again.</p>
            <p>By this we may ſee how theſe <hi>New-England</hi> Perſecutors were become inured to exceſſive Severity.<note place="margin">The Deaths of ſome of <hi>New-England</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors.</note> But before I leave them, I muſt alſo men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the dreadful Exit of ſome of them.</p>
            <p>The laſt Act of Governor <hi>Endicot</hi>'s bloody Part was the cruel Whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of <hi>Edward Wharton</hi> at <hi>Boſton,</hi>

               </note> related before: For the Time was now come that he muſt go off the Stage, to give an Account of his extravagant Severity before another Tribunal than that of his ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinary Court. The Meaſure ot his Iniquity was now filled up, and he was viſited with a loathſome Diſeaſe, inſomuch that he ſtunk alive, and ſo died with Rottenneſs, his Name being like to give a bad Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour thro' Ages to come.</p>
            <p>Yet more remarkable was the Death of Major General <hi>Adderton,</hi>

            <p>He upon a certain Day having exerciſed his Soldiers, and riding proudly on his Horſe towards his Houſe, when he came about the Place where uſually they looſed the <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſo called, from the Cart, after they had whipped them, a Cow came and croſſed the Way, at which his Horſe taking a Fright, threw him down ſo violently, that he died, his Eyes being ſtarted out of his Head, his Brains out of his Noſe, his Tongue out of his Mouth, and his Blood out of his Ears. Thus God's Judgments came upon him ſuddenly, and at unawares.</p>

More Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of this Nature I could produce, but theſe may ſuffice.</p>
            <p>What I have related ot theſe Cruelties, and much more, was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in Print about that Time, that ſo the King and Parliament of <hi>England</hi> might know what happened there.

               </gap> was their Happineſs, that they had not to do with revengeful People, elſe they might have been involved in great Streights: But the Friends of the Perſecuted committed Vengeance to God, tho' ſome of the Great Ones in <hi>England</hi> adviſed them to ſue the Perſecutors, which according to Law they might have done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Richard Bellingham,</hi> a fierce Perſecutor, and Governor, after <hi>John En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicot,</hi>

Not long before, <hi>William Coddington,</hi> Governor of <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> writ a Letter to him, wherein he put him in Mind of the former Times; for he, (the ſaid <hi>Coddington)</hi> had been one of the firſt Erectors of Colonies in <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the firſt that built an Houſe in <hi>Boſton,</hi> and afterwards was a Magiſtrate ſeven Years; but when Perſecution aroſe, he declared againſt it; and the Caſe was debated for three Days in the Court; but the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Party was the weakeſt, and was oppoſed by all the Prieſts, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept one <hi>John Cotton,</hi> who ſaid, he remembred, how at their Departure from <hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>J.

Now tho' <hi>Coddington</hi> was one of the greateſt Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, or Traders in that Country, and in all Probability might have acquired great Riches there; yet ſeeing his good Counſel was not heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to, he reſolved to depart that Place, and go and live ſomewhere elſe.

            <p>Yet one Thing remarkable I may mention here, which when I firſt: heard, I could not fully give Credit to; but thinking it worth the while to make a narrow Enquiry into it, I did ſo, not only by Writing, but alſo from the Mouths of Perſons that had been Eye-witneſſes, or had been informed by ſuch; and from theſe I got this concurring Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>A certain Perſon who ſpread ſome of theſe printed Relations, was impriſoned for his Pains; nevertheleſs another brought one of them to the King,<note place="margin">And brought to the King.</note> and told him how the Thing had been done; at which the King ſaid, <hi>I aſſure you it was not by my Advice that any of your Friends ſhould be ſlain: Ye muſt tell the Magiſtrates of the City of it, and proſecute the Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</hi> This Saying of the King was not long after publiſhed in Print:<note place="margin">The Diſperſer of it impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Brown.</hi>
               </note> But Violence prevailed ſtill; for the Perſon that was apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſpreading the ſaid Books, was ſent to Priſon by the ſpecial Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Alderman <hi>Brown,</hi> of whom ſince Mention may be made ſeveral Times in this Work, it gives me Occaſion to ſay ſomething of what kind of Man he was.</p>
            <p>In the Time of <hi>Cromwel</hi> he had been very fierce againſt the Royaliſts,<note place="margin">A ſhort Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of him.</note> eſpecially at <hi>Abingdon,</hi> not far from <hi>Oxford:</hi> For this Error he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd now to make Compenſation, by violent perſecuting of the harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>Quakers;</hi> otherwiſe he was a comely Man, and could commit Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty with a ſmiling Countenance. But more of his Actions may be repreſented hereafter.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Quakers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Quakers</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kept out of their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Houſes, preach in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Oftentimes they were kept out of their Meeting-houſes by the Soldiers; but then they did not uſe to go away, but ſtood before the Place, and ſo their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſoon encreaſed; and then one or other of their Miniſters generally
<pb n="337" facs="unknown:003104_0348_0FEFF662E3615B98"/>
ſtept upon a Bench or ſome high Place, and ſo preached boldly. Thus he got ſometimes more Hearers than otherwiſe he might have had. But ſuch an one ſometimes was ſoon pulled down, which then gave Occaſion for another to ſtand up and preach, and thus often four or five one after another, were taken away as innocent Sheep, and carried to Priſon with others of their Friends, it may be, forty or fifty at once. This puts me in Mind of what I heard my Mother, <hi>Judith Zinſpenning</hi> ſay, who in the Year next following, being gone for <hi>England,</hi> with <hi>William Caton</hi> and his Wife, who liv'd at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> to viſit her Friends there, and coming to <hi>London,</hi> went with others to the <hi>Bull</hi> and <hi>Mouth</hi> Meeting; but Entrance being denied, they ſtay'd in the Street, where ſhe ſaw one Preacher after another, pull'd down, at the Inſtant Cry of ſome Officer or other, <hi>Conſtable, take him away.</hi> Several being thus led away, the Conſtable came alſo to her, and perceiving by her Dreſs that ſhe was a <hi>Dutch</hi> Woman, pull'd her by the Sleeve, and ſaid with Admiration, <hi>What, a</hi> Dutch <hi>Quaker!</hi> but meddled no farther with her. This keeping of Meetings in the Streets became now a Cuſtomary Thing in <hi>England;</hi> for the <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſo called, were perſuaded that the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their publick Worſhip was a Duty no Man could diſcharge them from,<note place="margin">Accounting publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> and they believed that God required the performing of this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice from their Hands. And by thus meeting in the Streets, it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened ſometimes that more than one, nay, it may be three or four at a Time, did preach, one in one Place, and another in another, which in their Meeting-places could not have been done conveniently. But thus they got abundance of Auditors, and among theſe ſometimes emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Men, who paſſing by in their Coaches, made their Coachmen ſtop. At this Rate they found there was a great Harveſt, and thus their Church increaſed under Sufferings; and in thoſe ſharp Times they were pretty well purified of Droſs, ſince the Trial was too hot for ſuch as were not ſincere; for by frequenting their Meetings in ſuch a Time, one was in Danger of being either impriſoned, or beaten lame, or unto Death: But this could not quench the Zeal of the Upright.</p>
            <p>Now the taking away of one Preacher,<note place="margin">As one Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher's taken away, another ſtands up; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Women, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Boys.</note> and the ſtanding up of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, became an ordinary Thing in <hi>England,</hi> and it laſted yet long after, as I my ſelf have been an Eye-witneſs of there. And when there were no more Men-preachers preſent, it may be, a Woman would riſe, and miniſter to the Meeting; nay, there were ſuch who in Years being little more than Boys, were endued with a manly Zeal, and encouraged their Friends to Stedfaſtneſs. In the mean while, many alſo were impriſoned, without being haled out of their Meetings; for ſome have been appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended for ſpeaking only ſomething on the Behalf of their Friends, as <hi>Rebecca Travers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rebecca Travers</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned.</note> who going to the Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower,</hi> deſired him to have Compaſſion on ſome who were impriſoned for frequenting of Meetings. But he grew angry at this; and when ſhe went away, one of the Keepers gave her ill Language: On which, ſhe exhorting him, <hi>to be good in his Place, whilſt it was the Lord's Will he had it,</hi> he was ſo offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that going back to the Lieutenant, he complained that ſhe had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Treaſon, and thereupon ſhe was apprehended, and ſent to Priſon. Nay, the rude Soldiers were encouraged to Cruelty by Officers who were not a Whit better, for they themſelves would ſometimes lay vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Hands on peaceable People; as amongſt the reſt the aforemention'd Alderman <hi>Richard Brown,</hi> who formerly had been a Major General un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and now behaved himſelf with ſuch outrageous Fierceneſs, that even the Comedians did not ſtick to expoſe him,<note place="margin">A Relation of Alderman <hi>Brown</hi>'s Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Mayor and Sheriffs.</note> by an Alluſion to his Name <hi>Brown,</hi> and ſaying, <hi>The Devil was brown.</hi>

            <p>About the latter End of the aforeſaid Month,<note place="margin">And of Capt. <hi>Reeves</hi> at the <hi>Bull</hi> and <hi>Mouth,</hi> who is ſupported by Alderman <hi>Brown</hi> with great Fury.</note> on a Firſt-day of the Week, one Captain <hi>Reeves,</hi> and ſome Soldiers with Muskets and drawn Swords, came violently ruſhing into the <hi>Bull and Mouth</hi> Meeting, where they pulled down him that was preaching, and preſently laid hold of another, who deſired <hi>Reeves</hi> to ſhew his Order for this his doing: To which he anſwered, <hi>He would not in that Place;</hi> but it appeared after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that he could not, as having no Warrant. Yet he cauſed his Soldiers to take away about forty Perſons, (ſome of whom were not at the Meeting, but had been taken up in the Streets) and have them into <hi>Paul's Yard,</hi> where they were kept till the publick Worſhip was ended there; and then Alderman <hi>Richard Brown</hi> came into the Place where the Priſoners were guarded, and with great Rage and Fury laid Hands firſt on a very aged Perſon, and pulled him down twice by the Brim of his Hat, whereby he loſt it.

            <p>The ſame Day ſome Soldiers came to a Meeting in <hi>Tower-ſtreet,</hi>

The firſt Thing they did was to pull down him that preached, whom they haled out of the Meeting, rejoicing as if they had obtained ſome great Victory: Then they brought him to the Main-guard at <hi>Paul</hi>'s, and returned to the <hi>Bull and Mouth,</hi> where they apprehended ſome more, whom they alſo carried to <hi>Paul</hi>'s.

            <p>After this Manner,<note place="margin">The Barbarity of one <hi>Cox,</hi> a Wine-Cooper.</note> the Meetings of thoſe called <hi>Quakers</hi> were diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at that Time, of which I could produce, if neceſſary, many more lnſtances. Once one <hi>Cox,</hi> a Wine-Cooper, came with ſome Soldiers into a Meeting, where, after great Violence uſed, they took up two Men of thoſe called <hi>Quakers,</hi> whom they beat moſt grievouſly, becauſe they refuſed to go along with them, tho' they ſhewed no Warrant for it. At length the Soldiers carried them both upon Muskets into <hi>Paul</hi>'s Yard; and when they laid them down, they dragged one of them by the Heels on his Back, in a very barbarous Manner; which being done, the ſaid Wine-Cooper was heard to ſay, <hi>He would go and get a Cup of Sack, for theſe Devils had even wearied him out:</hi> And yet he went to another Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-place of theſe People, where he alſo behaved himſelf very wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and being asked for his Order, his Anſwer was, holding out his Sword, <hi>This is my Order.</hi> Thus it ſeems he would ingratiate himſelf with <hi>Brown,</hi> who now being in Favour at Court, was knighted, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time after alſo choſen Lord Mayor of <hi>London;</hi> and by his furious Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour the Soldiers were alſo encouraged to commit all Manner of Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief; inſomuch, that being ask'd, what Order they had for their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, one lifting up his Musket, ſaid, <hi>This is my Order:</hi> So that Things now were carried by Club-Law.

were much ſwoln; and this was done becauſe they refuſed to work, as being perſwaded that they had not deſerved to be treated ſo; they alſo eating nothing at the Charge of the ſaid Work-houſe. Theſe Lads, tho' pretty long in that Priſon, yet continued ſtedfaſt, rejoycing they were counted worthy to ſuffer for the Name of the Lord; and they wrote a Letter to their Friends Children, exhorting them to be faithful in bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Teſtimony for the Lord, againſt all Wickedneſs and Unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Some Days before this Time,<note place="margin">Private Dwellings broke open, and viſiting term'd a Meeting.</note> 
               <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>John Herbert,</hi> living in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and other Musketeers, came with their naked Swords into ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Dwellings, and broke two or three Doors; (for when ſome Perſons were ſeen to enter a Houſe, tho' it was only to viſit their Friends, it was called a Meeting.)<note place="margin">Five Perſons only being in a Houſe are ſent to <hi>Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> by Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Brown.</hi>

They denying to ſwear, were ſent back to Priſon, to ſtay there until they ſhould have taken the Oath. If I would here ſet down all ſuch like Caſes as have happened, I might find more Work than I ſhould be able to perform: For this vexing with the Oath was become ſo common, that ſome have been taken up in the Streets, and brought to a Juſtice of Peace, that he might ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Oath to them, and in Caſe of Denial, ſend them to Priſon, tho' this was directly contrary to the Statute of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi>

               <hi>That he was not fit to ſit on the Bench; for he made the Son to hang the Father at</hi> Abingdon; <hi>ſo that he could prove him to be a Murderer.</hi> This bold Saying cauſed ſome Diſturbance in the Court, and <hi>Brown,</hi> how heavy ſoever the Charge was, did not deny the Thing in Court, nor clear himſelf from it: Yet the other <hi>Quaker</hi> Priſoners did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this Upbraiding, but ſignified, <q>That tho' the Fact were true, yet they were not for reproaching any Magiſtrate upon the Bench, whoſe Place and Office they did reſpect and honour.</q> But I don't find that <hi>Brown</hi> (on that Account) ever proſecuted him that ſpoke ſo boldly, altho' otherwiſe he did whatever he would, without fearing that his Fellow-Magiſtrates, who reſpected him that was a Favourite at Court, would diſclaim it, as may appear by this following Inſtance.</p>
            <p>A certain Perſon, who had been taken by the Soldiers out of a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Priſon, in a very violent and abuſive manner, becauſe he was not willing to go, ſaid in the Court, <hi>That his refuſing to go, was becauſe they would not ſhew him any Warrant for their apprehending him; ſince for ought he knew, they might be Robbers or Murd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Thou haſt had many Warnings and Viſitations in the Love of God, but haſt ſlighted them; therefore beware of being ſealed up in the Wrath of God.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon one of the Jailors came with his Cane and ſtruck ſeveral of the Priſoners ſo hard, that divers of them were much bruiſed; and it was reported by ſome, that <hi>Brown</hi> cried, <hi>Knock him down,</hi> tho' others (for mitigating it a little) would have it, <hi>Pull, him down:</hi> But the former ſeems moſt probable; for the Blows were ſo violent, that ſome of the Spectators cry'd out <hi>Murder!

Thus Innocence was forced to give Way to Violence.

But he ſeemed to be quite hardened; for at a certain Time, two Perſons being upon their Trial for robbing of a Houſe, he told them, <hi>They were the verieſt Rogues in</hi> England, <hi>except it were the</hi> Quakers.</p>
            <p>Sometimes it happened that the Priſoners were brought to the Bar, without being indicted; and when they ſaid. <hi>What have we done?</hi> and deſired Juſtice; <hi>Brown</hi> having no Indictment againſt them, often cry'd, <hi>Will you take the Oath?</hi> And they then ſaying, That <hi>For Conſcience-ſake they could not ſwear,</hi> were condemned as Tranſgreſſors, tho' ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings as theſe, were directly againſt the Law.

And while I was waiting out of all viſible Things, and quite out of the World in my Spirit, and my Heart upon nothing but the living God, the Lord opened the Springs of the great Deep, and overflowed my whole Heart with Life and Love; and my Eyes were as a Fountain, becauſe of Tears of Joy, becauſe of his Heritage, of whom he ſhewed me and ſaid unto me in a full, freſh, living Power, and a holy, full Teſtimony, ſo that my Heart was raviſhed there with Joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable, and I was out of this Body with God, in his heavenly Paradiſe, where I ſaw and felt Things unutterable, and beyond all Demonſtration or Speech.

This was done but in Part, and it was ſaid to the Clerk, <hi>It was enough.</hi> The Priſoners ſaid then, That <hi>that Act was made in the Times of Ignorance, when the People were but newly ſtept out of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery;</hi> and they ſhewed alſo how unjuſtly they were dealt with. Then being required to plead <hi>Guilty</hi> or <hi>Not guilty</hi> to the Indictment, ſome who
<pb n="346" facs="unknown:003104_0357_0FEFF6B597FFFF48"/>
were not very forward to anſwer, were haled out of the Court, as taken <hi>pro confeſſis;</hi> and ſo ſent back to Priſon. The reſt, being twenty-two in Number,<note place="margin">Some dilatory in their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, ſent back to Priſon. Others plead Not guilty.</note> pleaded <hi>Not guilty.</hi> Then the Jurymen were called, and when they excepted againſt one, the Judge would not allow it, becauſe he did not like the Reaſon they gave, <hi>viz.</hi> That they ſaw Envy, Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, and a vain Deportment in him. Another was excepted againſt, becauſe he was heard to ſay, <hi>That he hoped ere long, that the</hi> Quakers <hi>ſhould be arraigned at the Bar, and be baniſhed to ſome Land, where there was nothing but Bears.</hi> At this the Court burſt out into a Laughter; yet the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception was admitted, and the Man put by. The Priſoners not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it convenient to make more Exceptions, the Jury were ſworn. Then two Witneſſes were called, who teſtify'd at moſt, that in ſuch a Place they took ſuch Perſons met together, whoſe Names were ſpecified in Writing.<note place="margin">Their Anſwer.</note> Then the Priſoners bid the Jury, <q>Take heed how they did ſport or dally with holy Things, and that thoſe Things, which concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Conſcience, were holy Things. And as a Man was not to ſport with the Health or Illneſs of his Neighbour, ſo he was not to ſport with the Liberty or the Baniſhment of his Neighbour. And whereas they were accuſed of being wicked, dangerous, and ſeditious Sectaries; that was not true; for they were not wicked, but ſuch as endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in the World; concerning the Truth of which, they appealed to themſelves. Neither were they ſeditious, but peaceable. And whereas they were charged for not coming to hear the <hi>Common-prayer,</hi> this was incongruous; for the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice-Book</hi> was not quite printed ſeveral Weeks after the ſaid 29th of <hi>June;</hi> ſo that they could not be charged of neglecting to hear that which was not to be heard read any where.</q> This puzzled the Court not a little; and other pinching Reaſons were alſo given by the Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſome of which were Men of Learning; inſomuch that the Judge was not able to anſwer the Objections but by Shifts and Evaſions. At length the Jury went out to conſult; and one of them was heard to ſay, as they were going up Stairs, <hi>Here is a deal to do indeed to condemn a Company of innocent Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After ſome Time, the Jury coming in again, and being asked, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Priſoners at the Bar were guilty or not guilty, they ſaid, <hi>They were guilty in Part,</hi> and <hi>not guilty in Part.</hi> But this Verdict did not pleaſe the Judge.<note place="margin">They are brought in guilty by the Jury after twice going out.</note> The Jury then going out again, and prevailing upon one another, quickly returned, and declared the Priſoners <hi>guilty, according to the Form of the Indictment.</hi> Hereupon the Judge <hi>Onſlow</hi> pronounced Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, <hi>viz. That they ſhould return to Priſon again, and lie there three Months without Bail; and if they did not make Submiſſion according as the Law di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, either at, or before the End of the aforeſaid three Months, that then they ſhould abjure the Realm: But in caſe they refuſed to make Abjuration, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Abjuration made, ſhould forbear to depart the Realm within the Time limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or ſhould return again without Licence, they ſhould be proceeded againſt as Felons.</hi>

            <p>I being in <hi>John's Street, London,</hi> about the thirteenth Day of the third Month (called <hi>May</hi>) with ſome of the People of God, to wait upon him, as we were ſate together, there came in a rude Man (called <hi>Miller</hi>) with a long Cane in his Hand, who laid violent Hands upon me, with ſome others, beating ſome, commanding the Conſtables who came in after him, but having no Warrant, were not willing to meddle, but as his Threatnings prevailed, they being afraid of him, joyned with him to carry ſeveral of us before Juſtice <hi>Powel</hi> (ſo called) who the next Day ſent us to the Seſſions at <hi>Hick's-Hall;</hi> where after ſome Diſcourſe ſeveral Times with them, manifeſting to them the Ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality both of our Commitment, and their Proceedings thereupon; yet notwithſtanding, they committed me and others, and cauſed an Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be drawn againſt us, founded upon the late Act againſt <hi>Quakers and others,</hi> and then remanded us to <hi>New-Priſon,</hi> where we continued for ſome Days, and then removed us to <hi>Newgate,</hi> where we remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Seſſions in the <hi>Old Bailey</hi> aforeſaid: Whereby thou may'ſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what Juſtice I met withal, by what went before, and now farther follows.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Chief Judge.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>We ſit here to do Juſtice, and are upon our Oaths; and we are to tell you what is Law, and not you us: Therefore, Sirrah, you are too bold.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>J. Crook.</speaker>
               <p>Sirrah is not a Word becoming a Judge; for I am no Felon; neither ought you to menace the Priſoner at the Bar: For I ſtand here arraigned as for my Life and Liberty, and the Preſervation of my Wife and Children, and outward Eſtate, [they being now at the Stake] there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ought to hear me to the full, what I can ſay in my own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, according to Law, and that in its Seaſon, as it is given me to ſpeak: Therefore I hope the Court will bear with me, if I am bold to aſſert my Liberty, as an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> and as a Chriſtian; and if I ſpeak loud, it is my Zeal for the Truth, and for the Name of the Lord; and mine Innocency makes me bold—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Judge.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is an evil Zeal;</hi> [interrupting <hi>John Crook].</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>J. C.</speaker>
               <p>No, I am bold in the Name of the Lord God Almighty, the everlaſting <hi>Jehovah,</hi> to aſſert the Truth, and ſtand as a Witneſs for it: Let my Accuſer be brought forth, and I am ready to anſwer any Court of Juſtice.—</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Then the Judge interrupted me, ſaying, <hi>Sirrah,</hi> with ſome other Words I do not remember: But I anſwered, You are not to threaten me, neither are thoſe Menaces fit for the Mouth of a Judge; for the Safety of the Priſoner ſtands upon the Indifferency of the Court: And you ought not to behave your ſelves as Parties, ſeeking all Advantages againſt the Priſoner, but not heeding any Thing that may make for his Clearing or Advantage.— The Judge again interrupted me, ſaying,</p>

Theſe Words he ſpake at the Bar, and as he was carrying away.

                  <hi>Friend</hi> Crook, <hi>we have given you Time to conſider of what was ſaid Yeſterday to you by the Court, hoping you may have better conſidered of it by this Time; therefore, without any more Words, will you take the Oath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> And called to the Clerk, and bid him read it.</p>

               <p>I did not, neither do I deny <hi>Allegiance,</hi> but do deſire to know the Cauſe of my ſo long Impriſonment; for, as I ſaid, I ſtand at your Bar as a Delinquent, and am brought hither by Force, contrary to the Law; therefore let me ſee my Accuſer, or elſe free me by Proclamation, as I ought to be, if none can accuſe me: For the Law is grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on right Reaſon, and whatſoever is contrary to right Reaſon, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Law; and therefore if no Accuſer appear, you ought to acquit me firſt, and then I ſhall anſwer, as I have ſaid, If any new Matter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; otherwiſe it is of Force, and that our Law abhors, and you ought not to take Notice of my ſo being before you; for what is not legally ſo, is not ſo; and therefore I am in the Condition, as if I were not before you: And therefore it cannot be ſuppoſed, in right Reaſon, that you have now Power, at this Time, and in this Place, legally to tender me the Oath.</p>

Then the Judges would have inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted me, but I ſaid as followeth: If you will not hear me, nor do me Juſtice; I muſt appeal to the Lord God of Heaven and Earth, who is Judge of Quick and Dead, before whom we muſt all appear, to give an Account for the Deeds done in the Body; for he will judge between you and me this Day, whether you have done me Juſtice or not.</p>

ſhall have Liberty till the next Seſſions, which is the ordinary Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, which Liberty we deſire, and we hope it is ſo reaſonable, it will not be denied, eſpecially upon this Occaſion, we being like to be made a Precedent: And Courts of Juſtice have uſed to be eſpecially careful in making of Precedents; for we are not provided, according to Law, to make our Defence at this Time, and therefore if we be put upon it, it will be a Surprizal.</p>

               <p>I hope you will not ſurprize us: Then the other Priſoners (who alſo were indicted) cryed out (having ſpoken ſomething before) <hi>Let us have Juſtice, and let not the Jury be ſworn till we be firſt heard.</hi> So there was a great Noiſe, the Court being in a Confuſion, ſome crying, <hi>Take them away;</hi> others, <hi>Stay, let them alone;</hi> others ſaying, <hi>Go on to ſwear the Jury:</hi> Which the Cryer in this Uproar and Confuſion did do ſomething, as if he had done it: Then we all cryed out for Juſtice and Liberty till the next Seſſions; the Court being in a Confuſion, ſome crying one Thing, and ſome another, which now cannot be called to Mind, by Reaſon of the great Diſtraction that was in the Court; neither what we ſaid to them, nor they to us, the Noiſe was ſo great, and the Commands of the Court ſo various to the Officers, ſome commanding them to take us away; others, to let us alone; others, to bring us nearer; others cried, Put them into the Bail-dock; others, to put them within the fartheſt Bar, where the Felons uſed to ſtand; where we were forced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to accordingly: And in this Hurliburly and Confuſion that was among them, ſome Men were ſworn, to teſtify that we refuſed to take the Oath, which we never poſitively did; other Officers of the Court, whom they would have ſworn, refuſed to ſwear, tho' preſs'd to it by the Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, they deſired to be excuſed. Then ſpake one of the Priſoners again pretty much, but could hardly be underſtood, by Reaſon of the Noiſe in the Court; but the People, to whom he ſpoke with a loud Voice, by Way of Exhortation, might hear the Subſtance of what he ſaid, which cannot now particularly be called to Mind; but it was to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Preſence and Love of God to himſelf, and to exhort others to mind his Fear, that they alſo might be acquainted with God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Thus the Injuſtice of theſe arbitrary Proceedings were expoſed to publick View, when this Trial appeared in Print; that the King himſelf might ſee thereby, how ill his Subjects were treated. But at that Time there were ſo many among the great Ones and Biſhops, who were inclined to promote the Extirpation of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> that there ſeemed no humane Help. <hi>J. Crook,</hi> ſhewed alſo circumſtantially, how in many Caſes of the Trial, they had acted againſt Law; for he himſelf having formerly been a Juſtice, knew well enough now an after what Manner Juſtice ought to be adminiſtred and maintained. How long he continued Priſoner, I can't tell. But by this Trial alone the Reader may ſee, how the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> ſo called, were treated in Regard of the Oath: And ſuch Kind of Proceeding was the Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>By theſe and the like Treatments we ſee how the Perſecutors en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to root out the <hi>Quakers,</hi> if poſſible; for the effecting of which, Alderman <hi>Richard Brown</hi> did whatever he could, continually letting looſe the Reins to his exorbitant Malice, without regarding whether that which he was bent againſt was really puniſhable, or not, whereof the following Inſtance may ſerve for an Evidence. A certain Mender of old Shoes who belonged to the Society of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> was deſired by a labouring Man on a ſeventh Day of the Week late at Night, to mend a Pair of Shoes for him, that he might have them again in the Morning, becauſe he had no other to wear. The Cobler, to accomodate the Man, ſat up at Work till after Midnight; but the Shoes not being finiſhed then, he went to Bed; and riſing early in the Morning, went to his Work again, as privately as he could in his Chamber. But an envious Neighbour informed againſt him for working on a Sunday; whereupon he was had before the ſaid <hi>R. Brown,</hi> who committed him to <hi>Bridewel,</hi> to be there kept to hard Labour. And he refuſing to beat Hemp, as being fully perſwaded that he had not deſerved ſuch a Puniſhment, was cruelly whipp'd, but he bore it with great Conſtancy, and not yeild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he was turned up among thoſe of his Society, who were impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>his Caſe, which befel an honeſt Man, was to be pitied, ſo there happened about that Time ſomething among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> which was facetious and ridiculous: For ſeveral of them being taken out of their religious Meetings, were confined in <hi>Newgate,</hi>

               </note> where in the Night, they lodged in a large Room, having in the middle of it a great Pillar, to which they faſtned their Hammocks, at the one End, and to the oppoſite Wall on the other, quite <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Such a Multitude of Bedding for ſo many Perſons in one Room, could not but ſomewhat infect the Air, and cauſe an unhealthy Steam; ſo that ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ew ſick, and one of the Priſoners died. This cauſed ſome Buſtle, and it was not without good Reaſon, that an ancient grave Citizen, having ſeen the Priſoners thus crouded up, ſaid, <hi>This is enough to breed an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection among them.</hi> And this having been told to Sir <hi>William Turner,</hi> one of the Sheriffs of <hi>London,</hi> he came into <hi>Newgate,</hi> and bidding the Turnkey bring down the ſaid Priſoners to him in the Preſs-yard, where he was, he ordered they ſhould return to <hi>Bridewel,</hi> where they had been before.<note place="margin">A ſhabby Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thruſt in among them removed by Means of <hi>T.

               </note> Now among theſe was a ſhabby Fellow, who, to get Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als without working, had thruſt himſelf among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> when they were taken at a Meeting, on Purpoſe to be ſent to Priſon, and to be maintained by them. This lazy Varlet was no ſmall Burden to our Priſoners; for whenever any Victuals were brought in to them, either
<pb n="362" facs="unknown:003104_0373_0FEFF6CB13B4CCC0"/>
for their Money, or ſent to them by their Friends, he did not ſtick to thruſt in with his Knife in Hand, and make himſelf his own Carver; and ſuch was his Impudence, that if he ſaw the Proviſion was ſhort, he would be ſure to take enough, tho' others wanted. But how burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſoever this lazy Drone was to the Priſoners, they could get no Relief; for to whom ſhould they complain? Since the Keepers as well as others were for vexing and oppreſſing them. But now at length an Opportunity was come to be rid of his troubleſome Company. Among the Priſoners, was <hi>Thomas Elwood,</hi> a Man of Literature, and of an acute Wit, with whom, long after, I entered into a familiar, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Correſpondence by Letters.

But judging this unreaſonable in a high De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, he could not bend thereto for Conſcience-ſake. He was kept there in Priſon about eight Months, with ſix or ſeven Score Priſoners beſides upon the ſame Account. But they being ſo crouded, that for want of Room their Natures were ſuffocated, many grew ſick and died, of which Number he was one.

And thus <hi>E. Burroughs</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Priſoner, tho' his Sickneſs increaſed.

This was the Exit of <hi>E.

Oh yes! the Children that are yet unborn, ſhall have thee in their Mouths, and thy Works ſhall teſtify of thee in Generations, who yet have not a Being, and ſhall count thee bleſſed. Did thy Life go out as a Snuff of the Candle? Oh nay!

               </note> being come from <hi>England</hi> in a weak Condition, for he had ſuffer'd ſo much Hardship in <hi>Bridewel,</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> that his Health was much impaired when he came into <hi>Holland.</hi> In his Sickneſs, which was a lingring Diſeaſe, he was told, that among the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> and Collegians, it was ſaid of him, that he had changed his Judgment, and was grieved for having judged them wrongfully. But to this he ſaid, It was not ſo, but that he ſtill judged their Way of Worſhip, eſpecially their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations and Will-worſhip, to be out of the Way of the Lord: And in this Belief he died in Peace.</p>
            <p>In his Youth he was of a chearful Temper,<note place="margin">Something concerning his Convincement and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> and a Lover of ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: But being in that Condition often diſquieted in his Mind, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a cloſer Follower of the Prieſts and Teachers, and exerciſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf diligently in reading the holy Scriptures, which, tho' good in it ſelf, yet did not bring him to true Peace with God, tho' being or a quick Underſtanding, he could talk much out of them, inſomuch, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into Society with the <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> he became a Teacher among them. But tho' he was now more preciſe, and endeavoured to avoid the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of Sins, yet he found that Root, from whence they ſprang, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained alive in him; for when he met with ſomething that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his own Will or Mind, Anger ſoon prevailed: Neverthleſs in that State he would ſpeak of Juſtification, Sanctification, and cleanſing by the Blood of Chriſt, tho' he himſelf was not come to that pure Waſhing. In this State he perceived that he was no true Member of Chriſt, becauſe Regeneration was ſtill wanting. Thus he ſaw that a high Profeſſion would not avail, and that ſomething more was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to obtain a happy State: But as yet he knew not what it was that thus diſquieted him, tho' ſometimes on the committing of any Sin, he felt ſomething that ſtruck him with Terror. At length it pleaſed the Lord, that he hearing one of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſo called, preach, That which convinceth Man of Sin, was the Light of Chriſt, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens every Man coming into the World, this Doctrine entred ſo deep with him, that he embraced it as wholeſome; and thus walking with great Circumſpection and Fear before the Lord, he found that by giving diligent Heed to that which inwardly reproved and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him of Evil, he came to be delivered therefrom, and to witneſs Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification. And thus advancing in Godlineſs, he himſelf became a zealous Preacher of that Doctrine, which had ſtruck him ſo to the Heart. He was indeed a zealous Man, and tho' ſome were ready to think him too zealous, yet he was diſcreet, and I know that he was condeſcending in indifferent Matters, thinking that there were Cuſtoms, which tho' not followed in one Country, were yet tolerable in another. He was alſo generous, and left he might ſeem to be burdenſome to any, he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther choſe to work with his Hands.</p>

            <p>One Colonel <hi>Robinſon</hi> was, ſince the King came in, made Juſtice of the Peace, and became a cruel Perſecutor of thoſe called <hi>Quakers,</hi> of whom he ſent many to Priſon; and hearing that ſome Liberty was allowed them, by the Favour of the Jailor, to come home ſometimes to viſit their Wives and Children, he made Complaint thereof to the Judge at the Aſſizes,<note place="margin">Judge <hi>Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> fines a Jailor, on the Complaint of Col. <hi>Robinſon</hi> for favouring Friends with ſome Liberty.</note> againſt the Jailor, who thereupon was fined an hundred Marks, by Judge <hi>Keeling.</hi> Not long after the Aſſizes, <hi>Robinſon</hi> ſent to a neighbouring Juſtice, deſiring he would go with him a Fanatick-hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (meaning the Diſturbing of <hi>Quakers</hi> Meetings.) On the Day that he intended thus to go a hunting, he ſent his Man about with his Horſes, and walked himſelf to a Tenement that he had, where his Cows and Dairy were kept, and where his Servants were then milking. Being come there, he asked for his Bull, and the Maids ſaid, they had ſhut him into the Field,<note place="margin">The dreadful Judgment that fell on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

the Ground, he broke his Leg, and the Bull then gored him again with his Horns, and roared, and licked up his Blood. One of the Maid-ſervants hearing her Maſter cry out, came running into the Field, and took the Bull by the Horns to pull him off; but he, without hurting her, gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put her by with his Horns, and ſtill fell to goring of him, and lick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his Blood.

His Siſter having Notice of this Diſaſter, came and ſaid, <hi>Alack Brother, what a heavy Judgment is this!</hi> And he anſwered, <hi>Ab Siſter, it is a heavy Judgment indeed: Pray let the Bull be killed, and the Fleſh given to the Poor.</hi> So he was taken up, and carried home, but ſo grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wounded, that he died ſoon after; and the Bull was become ſo fierce that they were forced to kill him by ſhooting. This was the Iſſue of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binſon</hi>'s miſchievous Intent to go a Fanatick-hunting.

G.

Now he could have gone away, and got out of their Reach; but conſidering that there being a Noiſe of a Plot in the North, if he ſhould go away they might fall upon his Friends; but if he ſtaid, and was taken, his Friends might eſcape the better; he therefore gave up himſelf to be taken.

But I hope, ſaid he, ye do not look upon us to be ſuch Men for our Meetings are not to terrify the King's Subjects, neither are we Enemies to him, or any Man.</hi> That which followed hereupon, was the tendring of the Oath of Allegiance and Supremacy to him. To which he told them, <hi>That he had never taken any Oath in his Life; and that he could not take any Oath at all, becauſe Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle had forbidden it.</hi> Then <hi>Rawlinſon,</hi> who was a Lawyer, asked him, <hi>Whether he held it was unlawful to ſwear?</hi>

Fox</hi> committed to Priſon. He then having the Paper about him which he had written againſt Plots, deſired it might be read in the Court: But this they would not ſuffer. Being thus committed for refuſing to ſwear, he ſaid to thoſe on the Bench and all the People, <hi>Take Notice that I ſuffer for the Doctrine of Chriſt, and for my Obedience to his Command.</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he underſtood, the Juſtices ſaid, that they had private Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

from Colonel <hi>Kirby</hi> to proſecute him, notwithſtanding his fair Carriage, and ſeeming Kindneſs to him before.</p>
            <p>Leaving <hi>G. Fox</hi> in Priſon, I am to ſay that the Act already mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whereby a Penalty was laid on all ſuch who ſhould ſay, <hi>It was not unlawful to take an Oath,</hi> was that which extended to Baniſhment, being made not long before, and expreſly levelled againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> as plainly appeared by the Title.<note n="*" place="margin">See the ſame before printed at large.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This is that Act, by Direction whereof the <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſo called, were afterwards baniſhed, as may be related in due Time and Place; and tho' the King himſelf was pretty good-natur'd, yet he ſuffered himſelf to be ſo ſwayed by the Inſtigations of ſome envious Men, as well among the Eccleſiaſticks as among the Laity, that he gave the Royal Aſſent thereto.</p>
            <p>Whilſt <hi>G. Fox</hi> was Priſoner at <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> many of his Friends were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo impriſoned, for frequenting Religious Meetings, refuſing to take Oaths, and for not paying Tythes to the Prieſts: But ſince he was not brought to his Trial till next Year, we will leave him ſtill in Jail, and in the mean while take a Turn to <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> where Perſecution now was exceeding fierce.</p>
            <p>In the Month of <hi>October,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cruel and bloody Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution at <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter, W. More</hi> Mayor.</note> 
               <hi>William More</hi> Mayor of that Town, came on a Firſt Day of the Week, and broke up the Meeting of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſo called, and committed ſome of them to Priſon; the next Week he did ſo again; and a Week after he cauſed a Party of the County-Troop to come to the Meeting. Theſe beat ſome, and did much Miſchief to the Forms, Seats, and Windows of the Meeting-place. And afterward the Mayor employed an old Man to ſtop People from going in at the Gate to the Meeting-Room; who told thoſe that would have entered, that the Mayor had ſet him there to keep them out. Now tho' they knew he was no Officer, nor had any Warrant, yet they made no Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but continuing in the Street, thus kept their Meeting in a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Manner, being not free for Conſcience-ſake to leave off their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip of God, tho' in that Time of the Year it was cold, and often wet Weather; and thus it continued many Weeks, tho' attended with ſo much Difficulty.</p>
            <p>In the Forepart or <hi>December,</hi> there came about forty or the King's Troopers, on Horſeback, in their Armour, with Swords, Carbines and Piſtols, crying, <hi>What a Devil do ye here?</hi> And falling violently upon this harmleſs Company, they beat them, ſome with Swords, and others with Carbines, without Diſtinction of Male or Female, old or young, until many were much bruiſed, chaſing them to and fro in the Streets. The next Firſt-day of the Week, theſe furious Fellows came again, having now got Clubs, wherewith, as well as with Swords and Carbines, they moſt grievouſly beat thoſe that were peaceably met together in the Street to worſhip God. This cruel Beating was ſo exceſſive, that ſome got above an hundred Blows, and were beaten ſo black and blue, that their Limbs loſt their natural Strength: One there was whom a Trooper beat <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But to avoid Prolixity, I ſhall not mention all the particular Miſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages which I find to have been committed there.

But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, their Zeal for their Worſhip was ſo lively, that they durſt not ſtay at Home, tho' humane Reaſoning might have adviſed them thereto.

And tho' ſhe then did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive very fierce Blows, yet there were ſome Women whoſe Lot it was to be ſorely beaten with Clubs, whereinto Iron Spikes were driven, as among the reſt an aged Widow, who received no leſs than twelve ſuch bloody Blows on ſeveral Parts of her Body; and another Woman was pierced in her Loins with ſuch a ſpiked Club. An ancient Man of ſixty-five Years was followed a great Way by three on Foot, and one on Horſeback, and ſo beaten and bruiſed, that a Woman, pitying this old Man, ſpoke to theſe miſchievous Fellows to leave off; but this ſo incenſed him that was on Horſeback, that he gave her a hard Blow with his Sword on the Shoulder, with curſing and railing. This Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity continued, till the Perſecutors ſeemed to be more wearied out than the Perſecuted, who ſeemed to grow valiant in theſe ſore Tribulations, how grievous ſoever.

            <p>Paſſing then by the other Perſecutions of this Year, I'll relate one remarkable Caſe that happened in this Year 1663, where Patience tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed very eminently over Violence. But before I enter upon this Narrative, it won't be amiſs to go back a little, and mention ſome ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Caſes of the chief Actor of the Fact I am going to deſcribe.</p>
            <p>His Name was <hi>Thomas Lurting,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Relation of <hi>T.

But returning, and paſſing by a Breaſt-work, they received a Volley of ſmall Shot, by which two Men, cloſe to one of which <hi>Thomas</hi> ſat, were killed, and a third was ſhot in his Back, but <hi>Thomas</hi>

            <p>About the Year 1654, it happened that among the Soldiers which were in the Ship he was in, there was one that had been at a Meeting of thoſe called <hi>Quakers</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and there were two young Men in the Ship who had ſome Converſe with him; but he was ſoon taken away from the Ship. Yet theſe two young Men ſeemed to be under ſome Convincement; for about ſix Months after, they ſcrupled to go and hear the Prieſt, and to put off their Hats to the Captain; by which they came to be called <hi>Quakers.</hi> Theſe two met often together in Silence, which being ſeen by others of the Ship, their Number increaſed; but this troubled the Captain exceedingly, and the Prieſt grew not a little angry, and ſaid to ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This made <hi>Thomas</hi> ſo furious,<note place="margin">He beats the <hi>Quakers</hi> aboard.</note> that in a bigotted Zeal he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ell to beating and abuſing theſe Men, when religiouſly met together. But this was not the Way to have a quiet and ſedate Mind; for the Remembrance of his former De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances ſtuck ſo cloſe upon him, that he could no more beat any of the ſaid People; and then he came to a farther Sight, inſomuch that he clearly ſaw what a Fellow the Prieſt was: For when <hi>Thomas</hi> could no longer abuſe the ſaid People, then he was not accounted by him either <hi>an honeſt Man,<note place="margin">Is under Trouble of Mind.</note> or a good Chriſtian.</hi> Now being under Condemnation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his Outgoings, he made many Promiſes to the Lord; but theſe being made in his own Will, were of little Effect. Yet by the Grace of God it was ſhewed him that ſince he did not perform theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, he could not be benefitted thereby, which cauſed to him much Trouble.</p>
            <p>Among thoſe in the Ship called <hi>Quakers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

In this State, feeling no Peace in his Mind, after ſome Time, he much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to be alone, the more freely to pour out his Heart before the Lord; and tho' he then felt himſelf inwardly condemned, yet Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments became pleaſant to him, becauſe thereby his Heart was tendered and broken; in which State he could not forbear ſometimes to cry out, <hi>0 Lord!</hi> But this being obſerved by the Ship's Crew made ſome ſay, <hi>He was mad;</hi> and others, <hi>He was diſtracted;</hi> and of this ſome writ home to <hi>England.</hi> Now it fell to his Share to be mock'd and ridicul'd; but he endeavoured to be fully given up, if he might but have Peace in his Conſcience with God.</p>
            <p>And being one Evening alone,<note place="margin">He is moved, but very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe to join with the <hi>Quakers.</hi>
               </note> he was very earneſt with the Lord to know what People he ſhould join himſelf to; and then it was plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewed him, <hi>the Quakers.</hi> But this ſo ſtartled him at that Time, that he deſired of the Lord, rather to die than to live: For to join with a People whom he ſo often had been beating and abuſing, ſeemed to be harder to him than Death it ſelf; and by the Subtilty of Satan he was often aſſaulted by various Thoughts, to keep him off from the ſaid People. But when the Lord made him mindful of his manifold Preſervations and Deliverances, it mollified his Heart, ſo that at Length he came to this Reſolution, <hi>Whether</hi> Quaker, <hi>or no</hi> Quaker, <hi>I am for
<pb n="376" facs="unknown:003104_0387_0FEFD55CDDE175B8"/>
Peace with God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Yet reſolves to do it.</note> Yet it coſt him many a bitter Sigh, and many a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful Tear, before he could come to a full Reſignation. But the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Reproofs of the Lord, attended with Judgments, followed him ſo cloſe, that he could no longer forbear, but gave up. And then he took Opportunity to diſcover his Heart to his Friend <hi>Roger Denis,</hi> who ſpoke ſo to the Purpoſe, that he had great Satisfaction. But not long after, Temptations aſſaulted him again in this Manner, <hi>What, to join thy ſelf to ſuch a fooliſh People?</hi> And the very Thoughts of this were ſo grievous to him, that he grew even weary of his Life; for thus to expoſe himſelf to Scorn, ſeem'd to him an intolerable Croſs. But this Struggling was not the Way to get Peace with God.<note place="margin">He goes to their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> The firſt Day of Week being come, he reſolved to go to the ſmall Meeting, who were now ſix in Number; but it being reported that he was among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> many of the Company left their Worſhip to ſee him; and they made a great Noiſe. When the Worſhip was over, the Captain asked the Reaſon of that Noiſe; and it was told him, that <hi>Thomas</hi> was amongſt the <hi>Quakers;</hi> on which he ſent for him, there being ſeveral Officers alſo preſent; but the firſt that ſpoke was the Prieſt, ſaying, Thomas, <hi>I took you for a very honeſt Man, and a good Chriſtian, but am ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry you ſhould be ſo deluded.</hi> And the Captain endeavoured to prove from the Bible, the <hi>Quakers</hi> were no Chriſtians. <hi>Thomas</hi> in the mean while was ſtill and quiet; and the others ſeeing they could not prevail upon him that Way, took another Courſe, and ſaid, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times came to him, ſaying, Do ſuch and ſuch a Thing, But becauſe he knew this to be altogether falſe, and ſaw how they would bear him down with Lies, he was the more ſtrengthened; ſo that going to his Friends, he ſaid to them, <hi>When I went to the Captain, I was ſcarce half a</hi> Quaker; <hi>but by their Lies and falſe Reports, they have made me almoſt a whole</hi> Quaker; <hi>or at leaſt I hope to be one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He continuing to meet with his Friends for performing of Worſhip,<note place="margin">They are vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</note> ſome more came to be joined to them, ſo that in leſs than ſix Months after, they were twelve Men, and two Boys, one of which was the Prieſt's. Now there was none aboard that would abuſe the <hi>Quakers,</hi> tho' much try'd by the Captain; for he got ſome Men out of other Ships on Purpoſe to vex them: But how fiercely ſoever theſe behaved themſelves, a higher Power limited them. At length there was a Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Ship, which ſwept away above Forty in a ſhort Time; and moſt of them called <hi>Quakers</hi> had the Diſtemper alſo, but none died of it, tho' ſome were brought very low: But they took great Care of one another when ſick, and whatever one had, was free for all; which Care being ſeen by others, made ſome of them cry upon their Death-bed, <hi>O carry me to the</hi> Quakers, <hi>for they take great Care one of another, and they will take ſome Care of me alſo.</hi>
               <note place="margin">He becomes more friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> This Viſitation in the Ship changed the Captain ſo much, that he was very kind to <hi>Thomas,</hi> and often ſent him Part of what he had. <hi>Thomas</hi> ſeeing him in ſuch a good Humour, deſired of him to have the Cabin he lay in before his Change; which Requeſt was granted, for none were willing to lie therein, becauſe they told one another it was troubled with an evil Spirit, ſince three or four had died therein within a ſhort Space of Time. This Cabin he made uſe of alſo for a Meeting-place; and the Captain was now ſo well pleas'd with him, that when ſomething was to be done, he would often ſay, Thomas, <hi>Take thy Friends, and do ſuch or ſuch a Thing:</hi> For as yet they were not againſt fighting,<note place="margin">

received no Hurt, tho' ſeveral others were kill'd and wounded; and they behaved themſelves ſo valiantly, that their Captain would ſay to other Captain, That <hi>he cared not if all his Men were</hi> Quakers, <hi>for they were the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieſt Men in his Ship.</hi> But tho' this was a Time of Liberty, yet <hi>Thomas</hi> lookt upon it as a Fore-runner of farther Exerciſe; for he ſaw what was done in pretended Friendſhip, was but to ſerve their own Ends; and therefore he expected a Time of Trial would come, and ſo it did.</p>
            <p>For being come to <hi>Leghorn,</hi> they were order'd to go to <hi>Barcelona,</hi> to take or burn a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Man of War. Their Station was to lie againſt a Caſtle, and batter it; which they did; and one Corner of the Caſtle playing ſome Shot into their Ship, <hi>Thomas</hi> was for beating down that Part: And thoſe called <hi>Quakers</hi> fought with as much Courage as any, he himſelf being ſtript to his Waſtcoat: And going into the Fore-caſtle, he levelled the Guns, but ſaid, <hi>Fire not, till I go to ſee where the Shot lights, that we may level higher or lower;</hi> he being yet as great a Fighter as any:<note place="margin">He becomes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe to fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> But as he was coming out of the Fore-Caſtle-Door, to ſee where the Shot fell, ſuddenly it run thro' him, <hi>What, if now thou kill'ſt a Man?</hi> This ſtruck him as a Thunder-bolt, and he that can turn all Mens Hearts at his Pleaſure, chang'd his in a Minute<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>When Night came, they went out of the Reach of the Caſtle-ſhot; and he took Occaſion to ſpeak with two of his Friends in the Ship, and enquired their Judgment concerning Fighting; but they gave little Anſwer to it, but ſaid however, <hi>If the Lord ſent them well home, they would never go to it again.</hi>
               <note place="margin">They reſolve againſt it.</note> To which he returned, <hi>That if he ſtood honeſt to that of God in his own Conſcience, and they came to it to-morrow, with the Lord's Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance he would bear his Teſtimony againſt it;</hi> for he clearly ſaw, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as they had been ſuch great Actors in Fighting, they now muſt bear their Teſtimony againſt it, and wait what would be the Iſſue; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with themſelves, <hi>The Will of the Lord be done.</hi> The next Day they heard that ſeveral were killed on Shore, which grieved <hi>Thomas</hi> not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. Some Time after, one of <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Friends went to the Captain to be cleared; and he asking <hi>Why?</hi> His Anſwer was, That <hi>he could fight no longer.</hi> To which the Captain ſaid, <hi>He that denies to fight in Time of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, I will put my Sword in his Guts. Then,</hi> ſaid the other, <hi>thou wilt be a Manſlayer, and guilty of ſhedding Blood:</hi> For which the Captain (who was a <hi>Baptiſt</hi>-Preacher) beat him ſorely with his Fiſt and Cane; and he that had been their Friend, was now become their open Enemy.</p>
            <p>Some Time after (about the Year 1655,) being at <hi>Leghorn,</hi> they were order'd to go a cruizing; and one Morning ſpied a great Ship bearing down upon them, which they ſuppos'd to be a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Man of War. Preſently Orders were given to clear the Ship for Fight. <hi>Thomas</hi> then being upon the Deck, few plainly that a Time of Trial was now come, and he prayed to the Lord very earneſtly for Strength: And that which ſeemed moſt expedient to him, was to meet with his Friends; which, after Notice given, was done accordingly. Being all met, he told them, how it was with him, and that Things ſeemed very dark and cloudy, yet <hi>his Hopes were, that the Lord would deliver him, and all ſuch as were, of his Faith;</hi> to which he added, <hi>I lay not this as an Injunction upon any one, but leave you all to the Lord:</hi> Moreover he ſaid, <hi>I muſt tell you, that the

Captain puts great Confidence in you; therefore let us be careful that we give him no juſt Occaſion; and all that are of my Mind, let us meet in the moſt publick Place upon the Deck, in the full View of the Captain, that he may not ſay we deceived him, in not telling him that we would not fight, ſo that he might have put others in our Room.</hi> Then <hi>Thomas</hi> went upon the Deck, and ſet his Back againſt the G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <hi>Go down to thy Quarters:</hi> To which he returned, <hi>I can fight no more.</hi> The Lieutenant then going to the Captain, made the worſt of it, ſaying, <hi>Yonder the</hi> Quakers <hi>are all together; and I do not know but they will mutiny, and one ſay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then he went upon the Half-deck again, and call'd for his Sword; which his Man having brought him, he drew with great Fury. No ſooner was this done, but the Word of the Lord, as <hi>Thomas</hi> took it, run thro' him, ſaying, <hi>The Sword of the Lord is over him; and if he will have a Sacrifice, proffer i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At which the Captain's Countenance changed pale,<note place="margin">The furious Captain calm of a ſudden.</note> and he turning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf about, called to his Man to take away his Sword; and ſo he went off. Not long after, the Ship they expected to fight withal, proved to be a <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> their Friend; and before Night the Captain ſent the Prieſt to <hi>Thomas,</hi> to excuſe his Anger, it having been in his Paſſion. To which <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Anſwer was, <hi>That he had nothing but good Will to him;</hi> and he bad the Prieſt tell the Captain, <hi>That he muſt have a Care of ſuch Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; for if he killed a Man in his Paſſion, he might ſeek for Repentance, and perhaps not find it.</hi>
               <note place="margin">They come home.</note> Thus <hi>Thomas</hi> overcame this Storm, and at length got ſafe home.</p>

               </gap> War, he ſuſtered very much: Once he faſted five Days, taking only at Times a Draught of Water; for he could eaſily gueſs, that if he had eaten of their Victuals, it would have gone the harder with him, ſince he ſcrupled to do any Ship-work, tho' it did not belong to fighting; for he judged all this to be Aſſiſtance to thoſe whoſe Buſineſs it was to fight; and that therefore in ſuch a Ship he could do nothing, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was, but it was being helpful and aſſiſting. In this Condition he met with ſeveral rude Occurrences for ſome Years together. Being once at <hi>Harwich,</hi> hard at work in a Ship, heaving out Corn in a Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he was preſs'd; but one of the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="379" facs="unknown:003104_0390_0FEFF69AD0875E78"/>
read, that he is worſe than an Infidel that will not provide for his Family? I have often heard the</hi> Quakers <hi>blamed for not working, but thou art the firſt that ever I heard blame them for working.</hi> At this the Captain ſaid, <hi>Turn him away, he is a</hi> Quaker. But a little after he cried, <hi>Pull him again, he is no</hi> Quaker; and ſaid to <hi>Thomas, Thou art no</hi> Quaker; <hi>for here thou bringeſt Corn, and of it is made Bread, and by the Strength of that Bread we kill the</hi> Dutch; <hi>and therefore no</hi> Quaker: <hi>Or art not thou as acceſſary to their Deaths, as we? Anſwer me. Thomas</hi> not preſently anſwering, was much ſcoff'd and jeer'd by the Sea-men; but at length he ſaid to the Captain, <hi>I am a Man that can feed my Enemies, and well may I you, who pretend to be my Friends.</hi> To which the Captain replied, <hi>Turn him away, he is a</hi> Quaker: And thus that Stormceaſed. But a few Days after, he was preſs'd again out of the ſame Veſſel, and carried on board a Man of War; there he was ordered to go into the Cabin, where the Captain and ſeveral Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers were; and being entered, the Captain began to curſe the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and ſwore, <hi>That if he did not hang</hi> Thomas, <hi>he would carry him to the Duke of</hi> York, <hi>and he would.</hi> But <hi>Thomas</hi> ſaid very little, and felt himſelf kept by the Lord from Fear. And when the Captain had tired himſelf with ſcolding and railing, he ſaid more mildly, <hi>What, doſt thou ſay nothing for thy ſelf?</hi> To which <hi>Thomas</hi> anſwer'd, <hi>Thou ſayeſt enough for thee and me too:</hi> And he found it moſt ſafe to ſay little: This was indeed the beſt Way; for generally no Reaſons, how good ſoever, avail with paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Men, who often think it a Diſparagement to them, when they hearken to what is ſaid by one they look upon to be their Inferior: But ſuch ſometimes find they reckon amiſs; as this Captain did, who, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his Haughtineſs, was ſoon ſtruck by a ſuperior Power; for the next Night a ſudden Cry was heard, <hi>Where is the</hi> Quaker, <hi>Where's the</hi> Quaker? <hi>Thomas</hi> hearing this, ſaid, <hi>Here I am: What lack you at this time of the Night?</hi> To which it was told him, <hi>You muſt came to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain preſently.</hi> He then coming to the Cabin-door, the Captain ſaid, <hi>Is the</hi> Quaker <hi>there?</hi> To which <hi>Thomas</hi> having anſwered, <hi>Yes,</hi> the Captain ſaid, <hi>I cannot ſleep, thou muſt go on Shore. Thomas</hi> reply'd, <hi>I am in thy Hand, and thou may'ſt do with me as thou pleaſeſt.</hi> So with the Boat he was put on Shore at <hi>Harwich,</hi> by Order of the Captain, who in his Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry had ſaid, That <hi>Hanging was too good for him:</hi> But now becauſe his Mind was diſquieted, he could not ſleep, tho' <hi>Thomas,</hi> who lay on the hard Boards, ſlept very well.</p>
            <p>Having ſaid thus much of this Sea-man, let us now take a View and behold how, and in what an induſtrious Manner, he, without paſſing the Bounds of a peaceable Diſpoſition, retook a Ship that was taken by a pyrate, which happened in the Year 1663, after this Manner.</p>

great Experience of the Lord's Deliverances, as hath been ſaid above, he had already learned to truſt in God, almoſt againſt Hope: On the Conſideration of this, all Fear was removed from him; and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Ship's Side to ſee the <hi>Turks</hi> come in, he received them as if they were his Friends; and they alſo behaved themſelves civilly: Then he ſhewed them all the Parts of the Veſſel, and what ſhe was la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with. Afterwards he ſaid to the Men that were with him, <hi>Be not afraid, for all this we ſhall not go to</hi> Algiers: <hi>But let me deſire you, as ye have been willing to obey me, to be as willing now to obey the</hi> Turks. This they promis'd him; and by ſo doing he ſoon perceived they gained upon the <hi>Turks;</hi> for they ſeeing the Seamens Diligence, grew the more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and favourable to them: And having taken ſome ſmall Matter of the Lading, ſome went again to their own Ship, and eight <hi>Turks</hi> ſtaid with the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Then the Mate began to think of the Maſter, and the other Four that were in the <hi>Turks</hi> Ship; as for himſelf and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with him, he had no Fear at all; nay, he was ſo far from it, that he ſaid to one of his Men, <hi>Were but the Maſter on board, and the reſt of our Men, if there were twice as many</hi> Turks, <hi>I ſhould not fear them.</hi> By this he encouraged the Seamen, who not being of his Perſuaſion, thought much otherwiſe than he, and would have been ready enough to have kill'd the <hi>Turks,</hi> if they had ſeen Opportunity. In the mean while the Mate's earneſt Deſire to the Lord was, that he would put it into the Heart of the <hi>Turks,</hi>

But his Anſwer was, <hi>if we offered to riſe, and they overcame us, we had as good be burnt alive.</hi> The Mate knew very well the Maſter was in the right, <hi>viz.</hi> that if they failed in the Attempt, they were like to meet with the moſt cruel Treatment from the <hi>Turks</hi> that could be thought of. Now the Reaſon why the Maſter tho' a very bold ſpirited Man, did not readily conſent to the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, was, becauſe he feared they would ſhed Blood; but his Mate told him, <hi>They were reſolved, and he queſtioned not but to do it, without ſhedding one Drop of Blood;</hi> and beſides, <hi>he would rather have gone to</hi> Algiers, <hi>than to kill one</hi> Turk. Speaking thus, he ſo ſwayed the Maſter, that at laſt

he agreed to let him do what he would, provided they kill'd none. Now ſince two <hi>Turks</hi> lay in the Cabin with the Maſter,<note place="margin">The Maſter gives Liberty to the Mate.</note> it was agreed that he ſhould continue to lie there, leſt they ſhould miſtruſt any Thing.

However, to deceive the <hi>Turks,</hi> they ſail'd to and fro for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Days; for in the Day Time they were for going to <hi>Algiers,</hi> but when Night came, they ſteered the contrary Way, and went back again, by which Means they kept the <hi>Turks</hi> in Ignorance, ſo as to be quiet.</p>
            <p>But on the Ninth Day, being all upon Deck, when none of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were there but the Maſter, his Mate, and the Man at the Helm, they began to be ſo untoward and haughty, that it roſe in the Mate's Mind, <hi>What if they ſhould lay hold on the Maſter, and caſthim over board:</hi> For they were ten luſty Men, and he but a little Man. This Thought ſtruck him with Terror; but recollecting himſelf, and taking Heart, he ſtamp'd with his Foot, and the Men coming up, one ask'd for the Crow, and another for the Ax, to fall on the Turks; but the Mate had them, <hi>Not to hurt the</hi> Turks, and ſaid, <hi>I will lay hold on their Captain:</hi> Which he did, for having heard them threaten the Maſter, he ſtept forward, and laying hold of the Captain ſaid, <hi>He muſt go down;</hi> which he did very quietly, and all the reſt followed him.<note place="margin">They draw to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Barbary.</hi> Shore, deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to land the <hi>Turks.</hi>
               </note> Two Days after, being come on the Coaſt of <hi>Barbary,</hi> they were, according to what the Turks ſaid, about fifty Miles from <hi>Algiers,</hi> and ſix from Land; and in the Afternoon it fell calm. But how to ſet the <hi>Turks</hi> on Shore was yet not reſolved upon. The Mate ſaw well enough, that he being the Man who had begun this Buſineſs, it would be his Lot alſo to bring it to an End. He then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the Maſter that he was willing to carry the Turks on Shore; but how to do this ſafely, he as yet knew not certainly; for to give them the Boat,<note place="margin">But at a Loſs how to do it with Safety.</note> was too dangerous, for then they might get Men and Arms, and ſo come and retake the Ship with its own Boat; and to carry them on Shore with two or three of the Ship's Men, was alſo a great Hazard, becauſe the Turks were ten in Number: And to put one half on Shore was no leſs dangerous; for then they might raiſe the Country, and ſo ſurprize the <hi>Engliſh</hi> when they came with the other half. In this great Strait the Mate ſaid to the Maſter, <hi>If he would let him have the Boat and three Men to go with him, he would venture to put the</hi> Turks <hi>on Shore.</hi> The Maſter, relying perhaps on his Mate's Conduct, conſented to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, tho' not without ſome Tears dropt on both Sides. Yet the Mate taking Courage, ſaid to the Maſter, <hi>I believe the Lord will preſerve me, for I have nothing but Goodwill in venturing my Life; and I have not the leaſt Fear upon me;</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Mate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes with 3 to go with him in the Boat, to put them on Shore, being 10 in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</note> but truſt that all will do well. The Maſter having conſented, the Mate called up the <hi>Turks,</hi> and going with two Men and a Boy in the Boat, took in theſe ten <hi>Turks,</hi> all looſe and unbound. Perhaps ſome body will think this to be a very inconſiderate Act of the Mate, and that it would have been more prudent to have tyed the <hi>Turks</hi> Hands, the rather becauſe he had made the Men promiſe, that they ſhould do nothing to the <hi>Turks,</hi> until he ſaid, <hi>He could do no more;</hi> for then he gave them Liberty to act for their Lives ſo as they judg'd conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.

For calling in the Captain of the <hi>Turks,</hi> he plac'd him firſt in the Boat's Stern; then calling for another, he plac'd him in his Lap, and one on each ſide, and two more in their Laps, until he had placed them all; which he did to prevent a ſudden riſing. He himſelf ſat with a Boat-hook in his Hand on the Bow of the Boat, having next to him one of the Ship-men, and two that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Theſe were all their Arms, beſides what belonged to the <hi>Turks,</hi> which they had at their Command. Thus the Boat went off,<note place="margin">The Boat puts off towards the Shore.</note> and ſtood for the Shore. But as they came near it, the Men g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>owing afraid, one of them cried out of a ſudden, <hi>Lord have Merey on us, there are</hi> Turks <hi>in the Buſhes on Shore.</hi> The <hi>Turks</hi> in the Boat perceiving the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to be afraid, all roſe at once. But the Mate, who in this great Strait continued to be hearty, ſhewed himſelf now to be a Man or Courage, and bid the Men to <hi>Take up ſuch Arms as they had; but do nothing with them until he gave them Leave.</hi> And then ſeeing that there were no Men in the Buſhes, and that it was only an Imagination, all Fear was taken away from him, and his Courage increaſing, he thought with himſelf, <hi>It is better to ſtrike a Man, than to cleave a Man's Head;</hi> and turning the Boat-hook in his Hand, he ſtruck the Captain a ſmart Blow, and bid him ſit down; which he did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, and ſo did all the reſt. After the Boat was come ſo near the Shore,<note place="margin">He ſets the <hi>Turks</hi> on Shore.</note> that they could eaſily wade, the Mate bid the <hi>Turks</hi> jump out, and ſo they did, and becauſe they ſaid, they were about four Miles from a Town, he gave them ſome Loaves, and other Neceſſaries.<note place="margin">G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Engliſh</hi> then putting the Boat cloſer in, threw them all their Arms on Shore, being unwilling to keep any Thing of theirs.

            <p>Now <hi>Caton,</hi> tho' given up in the Will of the Lord, and prepared to have found his Grave in the Deep, yet did not omit to call upon the Lord, and to pray to the Moſt High for Deliverance, if it were conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with his holy Will; and when the Storm was at the higheſt, his Supplication was heard, and the Tempeſt on a ſudden began to ceaſe, and the Wind to abate, which gave him Occaſion to praiſe the Almighty for the great Mercy ſhewed to him and the Mariners.<note place="margin">And driven to <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> where <hi>W.

               <hi>Stephen Criſp</hi> came the firſt time into <hi>Holland,</hi> to viſit his Friends there, and to edify them with his Gift.

But having heard that one of their Tenets was, that Sin might be overcome in this Life, this ſeemed to him a great Error. And therefore when <hi>James Parnel</hi> came to <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> he armed himſelf with Arguments to oppoſe him earneſtly: For looking upon him as one that was but a Youth, he thought he ſhould be able to prevail upon him. He himſelf was then about ſeven and twenty Years of Age, being not only well verſed in ſacred Writ, but alſo in the Writings of many of the ancient Philoſophers.<note place="margin">He is convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by <hi>J.

               </note> Now after he had heard <hi>Parnel</hi> preach very powerfully and found his Words more piercing than he had imagin'd, he ventur'd to oppoſe him with ſome Queries: But he ſoon found, that this young Man was endued with ſound Judgment; and with all his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Knowledge he was not able to reſiſt him, but was forced to ſubmit to the Truth he held forth. Now he thought himſelf ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched, that for a Month or two he made it his Buſineſs by the Strength
<pb n="386" facs="unknown:003104_0397_0FEFF6EA3076FB80"/>
of his Reaſon to defend the Truth he had embraced. But he ſoon found that this was not ſufficient; for Self was not ſubdued under the Croſs, and he was not yet come to an experimental Knowledge of what he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted and defended with Words. In this Condition he ſaw that he muſt truly become poor in Spirit, if God ever ſhould enrich him with heavenly Wiſdom. This brought him to Mourning and Sorrow, by which he came more and more to be weaned from his natural Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, wherein he uſed to delight. And continuing faithful in this Way of Self-denial, he at length began to enjoy Peace in his Mind, and ſo advanced in Virtue and real Knowledge, that in Time he became an eminent Miniſter of the Goſpel, and travelling to and fro, many were converted by his Miniſtry.</p>

Conſider that thy Injuſtice done by Colour of Office, deſerves to have a Puniſhment proportionable to the Offence; and can the Offence in the Eye of the Lord be any leſs than Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, becauſe thou haſt pretended to do it in the Name of the Holy Ghoſt, and ſo would'ſt make the Holy Ghoſt the Author of thy Offence, which it is not? And ſeeing thou art guilty of Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, there is a Puniſhment already proportioned for ſuch an Offence; and alſo thou art puniſhable by the Law of the Land, for preſuming under Pretence of a Commiſſion, and as a Judge, to paſs the Sentence of Death upon the Bodies of Men and Women, and pretending to go by as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Rule in ſo doing, as the Judges of the Land do,</hi> &amp;c Thus continued <hi>Farnſworth</hi> to anſwer <hi>Muggleton</hi> at large, and ſhewed him how his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was not only contrary to Truth, but alſo againſt the Law of the Land. But he was daring enough to give a Reply to this ſerious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Muggleton</hi> replies.</note> and ſaid in it, <hi>That he ſhould commend</hi> Farnſworth, Firſt, <hi>For ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Name to it;</hi> and Secondly, <hi>For ſetting down his Words ſo truly and punctually, that it made his Commiſſion and Authority to ſhine the more bright and clear. And that he was as true an Ambaſſador of God, and Judge of Mens ſpiritual Eſtate, as any ever was ſince the Creation of the World. And if you</hi> Quakers <hi>and others</hi> (thus continued he) <hi>can ſatisfy your ſelves, that there never was any Man commiſſioned of God to bleſs and curſe, then you ſhall all eſcape that Curſe I have pronounced upon ſo many Hundreds; and I only ſhall ſuffer for curſing others without a Commiſſion from God. But my Commiſſion is no pretended Thing, but as true as</hi> Moſes<hi>'s, the Prophets, and the Apoſtles Commiſſion was.</hi> A Multitude more of Abominations this Blaſphemer belched out, and among the reſt, <hi>That no Man could come to the Aſſurance

of the Favour of God, but in believing that God gave this Power unto</hi> John Reeves <hi>and himſelf. That be had Power given him over all other Gods and infinite Spirits whatſoever. That he</hi> [Muggleton] <hi>had the Keys of Heaven, and of Hell; and that none could get into Heaven, except he opened the Gates. That he had Power to remit their Sins who received his Doctrine, and to retain and bind their Sins more cloſe upon their Conſciences, for their deſpiſing or not receiving his Doctrine. That he was ſingle in Doctrine, Knowledge, Judgment and Power, above all Men, either Prophets or Apoſtles, ſince the Beginning of the World, or that ſhould be hereafter whilſt the World doth endure. That there was no true Miniſter, Meſſenger, nor Ambaſſador of God in the World but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, neither ſhould there be ſent any of God after him to the World's End. That a God, without him, ſpoke to him by Voice of Words to the hearing of the Ear. That no Perſon condemned by him could make his Appeal unto God, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by himſelf nor by any other; becauſe God was not in the World at all. This Power to condemn</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath God given unto me, and in this Regard I am the only and alone Judge what ſhall become of Men and Women after Death; neither ſhall thoſe that are damned by me, ſee any other God or Judge but me.</hi> I am loth to tranſcribe more of theſe moſt horrible Blaſphemies; and we have Cauſe to wonder at the long Forbearance of God, that he thus bore the diſdainful Affront offered by this inhumane Monſter in Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his Almightineſs. This <hi>Muggleton</hi> ſaid alſo to <hi>Farnſworth,</hi> That <hi>Becauſe he was not under the Sentence of his Commiſſion by Verbal Words or Writing, he ſhould give Anſwer to his Letter.

Hereafter I ſhall have Occaſion again to make Mention of this <hi>Muggleton,</hi> for he lived yet ſeveral Years; and I don't find that any Puniſhment was inflicted on him by the Magiſtrates, other than the Pillory, and half a Year's Impriſonment; tho' many think, not without good Reaſon, that ſuch Blaſphemers ought to be ſecluded from Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with Men.</p>

            <p>IN the foregoing Year we left <hi>G.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, <hi>I am a Chriſtian, and Chriſt commands me not to ſwear; and ſo doth the Apoſtle</hi> James <hi>likewiſe; and whether I ſhould obey God or Man, do thou judge. I ask you again,</hi> ſaid the Judge, <hi>Whether you will ſwear or no?</hi> To which he made Anſwer, <hi>I am neither</hi> Turk, Jew, <hi>nor</hi> Heathen, <hi>but a</hi> Chriſtian, <hi>and ſhould ſhew forth Chriſtianity. Doſt thou not know</hi> (thus he went on) <hi>that Chriſtians in the Primitive Times un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ten Perſecutions, and ſome alſo of the Martyrs in Queen</hi> Mary's <hi>Days refuſed Swearing, becauſe Chriſt and the Apoſtle had forbidden it? Ye have Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience enough, how many Men have ſworn firſt to the King, and then againſt him. But as for me, I have never taken an Oath in all my Life; and my Allegiance doth not lie in ſwearing, but in Truth and Faithfulneſs: For I honour all Men, much more the King. But Chriſt, who is the great Prophet, who is the King of Kings, the Saviour of the World, and the great Judge of the whole World, he ſaith, I muſt not ſwear. Now the Point is, whether I muſt obey Chriſt, or thee. For it is in Tenderneſs of Conſcience, and in Obedience to the Command of Chriſt, that I do not ſwear. And we have the Word of a King for tender Conſciences. G. Fox</hi> having ſpoke thus much, ask'd the Judge, <hi>If he did own the King?</hi> To which he ſaid, <hi>Yes, I do own the King. Why then,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>Doſt thou not obſerve his Declaration from</hi> Breda, <hi>and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes made ſince he came into</hi> England, That no Man ſhould be called in Queſtion for Matters of Religion, ſo long as they lived peaceably? <hi>Now if thou owneſt the King, why doſt thou call me into Queſtion, and put me upon taking an Oath, ſeeing thou or none can charge me with unpeaceable Living?</hi> The Judge looking angry, ſaid, <hi>Sirrah, will you ſwear?</hi> To which <hi>G. Fox</hi> told him, <hi>I am none of thy Sirrahs; I am a Chriſtian; and for thee, who art an Old Man and a Judge, to ſit there, and give Nick-names to Priſoners, doth not become either thy grey Hairs or thy Office.</hi> The Judge being a little more cool, after ſome Words to and fro, ſaid, <hi>G. Fox, Say, whether thou wilt take the Oath, Yea, or Nay?</hi> To which he reply'd, <hi>If I could take any Oath at all, I ſhould take this: For I do not deny ſome Oaths only, or on ſome Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, but all Oaths, according to Chriſt's Doctrine, who ſaid,</hi> Swear not at all. <hi>Now if thou, or any of you, or any of your Miniſters or Prieſts here, will prove that ever Chriſt or his Apoſtle, after they had forbidden all Swearing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Chriſtians to ſwear, then I will ſwear.</hi> None of the Prieſts offering

Another Time, as he was walking in the Room, with his Mind upon the Lord, he ſaw an extraordinary great Light, and looking up, he beheld an Angel of the Lord, with a glittering Sword ſtretched Southward, which ſhone ſo bright, as if the Court had been all on Fire. Or which I have for Proof what he mentions of it in his Journal, and alſo another ſmall Book he gave out with the Title of <hi>A Warning to</hi> England.

Fox</hi> being brought thither, Judge <hi>Turner</hi> then ſat on the Crown-Bench; and being called to the Bar, the Judge ask'd the Juſtices, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they had tendered him the Oath at the foregoing Seſſions?</hi> They ſaying, <hi>they had,</hi> and having ſworn it, the Jury were ſworn too. Then the Judge ask'd him, <hi>Whether he had not refuſed the Oath at the laſt Aſſizes?</hi> To which he anſwered, <hi>I never took Oath in my Life; and Chriſt the Saviour and Judge of the World, ſaid,</hi> Swear not at all. The Judge ſeeming not to take Notice of this Anſwer, ask'd him, <hi>Whether or no he had not refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to take the Oath at the laſt Aſſizes? G. Fox</hi> maintaining the Unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſwearing, the Judge ſaid, <hi>He was not at that Time to diſpute whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was lawful to ſwear, but to enquire whether he had refuſed to take the Oath, or no. G. Fox</hi> then ſignifying that he did not diſapprove the Things mentioned in the Oath, ſaid, <hi>Plotting againſt the King, and owning the Pope's, or any other foreign Power, I utterly deny.</hi> Well, ſaid the Judge, <hi>You ſay well in that: But did you deny to take the Oath; what ſay you? What would'ſt thou have me to ſay?</hi> reply'd he, <hi>I have told thee before what I did ſay.</hi> After ſome more Words from both Sides, the Indictment was read. <hi>G. Fox</hi> having inform'd himſelf of the Errors that were in it, ſaid, <hi>He had ſomething to ſpeak to it, for there were many groſs Errors in it.</hi> The Judge ſignified that he would not hear him; but when he was at the Point of giving Judgment. The Jury going out, ſoon returned, and brought him in guilty.<note place="margin">He is brought in guilty.</note> Whereupon he told them, <hi>That both the Juſtices and they too had forſworn themſelves;</hi> which cauſed ſuch Confuſion in the Court, that the pronouncing Judgment was delay'd. <hi>Margaret Fell</hi> being next brought to the Bar, was alſo declared guilty: And the next Day ſhe and <hi>G Fox</hi> were brought up again to receive Sentence. Her Council plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many Errors in her Indictment, ſhe was ſet by; and <hi>G. Fox</hi> then being call'd, ſhewed himſelf unwilling to let any Man plead for him;
<pb n="391" facs="unknown:003104_0402_0FEFF72EDFA1BF70"/>
which ſeem'd to make ſome Stop; yet he was ask'd by the Judge, what he had to ſay why he ſhould not paſs Sentence upon him. At which he told him, <hi>I am no Lawyer, but yet I have much to ſay, if thou wilt but have Patience to hear.</hi> Hereupon thoſe on the Bench laughed, and ſaid, <hi>Come, what have you to ſay?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Proves the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Inſtances.</note> Then he ask'd the Judge, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Oath was to be tendered to the King's Subjects, or to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of foreign Princes. To which the Judge ſaid, <hi>To the Subjects of this Realm.</hi> Then ſaid <hi>George, Look the Indictment, and ye may ſee that ye have left out the Word</hi> Subject: <hi>And not having named me in the Indictment as a Subject, ye cannot premunire me for not taking the Oath.</hi> They then looking to the Statute, and the Indictment, ſaw that it was as he ſaid, and the Judge confeſſed that it was an Error. Next <hi>G. F.</hi> told him, <hi>He had ſomething elſe to ſtop Judgment;</hi> and he deſired them to look what Day the Indictment ſaid the Oath was tendered to him at the Seſſions there: They looking, ſaid it was the eleventh of <hi>January.</hi> Then he ask'd, <hi>What Day of the Week was that Seſſion held on? On a</hi> Tueſday, ſaid they. To which <hi>G. F.</hi> ſaid, <hi>Look in your Almanacks, and ſee whether there was any Seſſion held at</hi> Lancaſter <hi>on the eleventh of</hi> January. They looking, found that the eleventh Day was the Day called <hi>Monday,</hi> and that the Seſſions were on the Day called <hi>Tueſday,</hi> which was the twelfth Day of the ſaid Month: <hi>Look ye now,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ye have indicted me for refuſing the Oath in the Quarter-Seſſions held at</hi> Lancaſter <hi>on the eleventh Day of</hi> Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary <hi>laſt, and the Juſtices have ſworn that they tendered me the Oath in open Seſſions here that Day; and the Jury upon their Oath have found me guilty thereupon; and yet ye ſee there was no Seſſions held at</hi> Lancaſter <hi>that Day.</hi> The Judge, to cover the Matter, askt, <hi>Whether the Seſſions did not begin on the eleventh Day?</hi> To which ſome in the Court anſwered, <hi>No; the Seſſions held but one Day, and that was the twelfth.</hi> Then the Judge ſaid, <hi>This was a great Miſtake, and an Error.</hi> Some of the Juſtices grew to angry at this, that they ſeeming ready to have gone off the Bench, ſtampt, and ſaid, <hi>Who hath done this? Some Body hath done this on purpoſe.</hi> Then ſaid <hi>G.F. Are not the Juſtices here that have ſworn to this Indictment, forſworn Men? But this is not all; I have more yet to offer why Sentence ſhould not be given againſt me. In what Year of the King was it, that the laſt Aſſize, which was in the Month called</hi> March, <hi>was holden here?</hi> To this the Judge ſaid, <hi>It was in the ſixteenth Year of the King.</hi> But, ſaid <hi>G. F. The Indictment ſays it was in the fifteenth Year.</hi> This was alſo acknowledged to be an Error: But both Judge and Juſtices were in ſuch a Fret, that they knew not what to ſay; for it had been ſworn alſo, that the Oath was tendered to <hi>G. F.</hi> at the Aſſize mention'd in the Indictment, <hi>viz.</hi> in the fifteenth Year of the King, whereas it was in the ſixteenth; which made <hi>G. F.</hi> ſay, <hi>Is not the Court here forſworn alſo, they having ſworn a whole Year falſe?</hi> Some other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Errors he ſhew'd, which I, having no Mind to be tedious, paſs by with Silence. <hi>G. F.</hi> then deſiring <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and ſaying, <hi>that he did not look for Mercy,</hi> the Judge ſaid, <hi>You muſt have Juſtice, and you ſhall have Law:</hi> Which made him ask,<note place="margin">The Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment quaſh'd.</note> 
               <hi>Am I now free from all that hath been done againſt me in this Matter? Yes,</hi> ſaid the Judge; but then ſtarting up in a Rage, he ſaid, <hi>I can put the Oath to any Man here; and I will tender you the Oath again. G. F.</hi> then telling him, that he had Examples enough of Yeſterday's ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and falſe ſwearing; <hi>for I ſaw before my Eyes,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that both Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Jury forſwore themſelves;</hi> yet the Judge ask'd him if he would take the Oath:<note place="margin">He is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd to be at Liberty, yet not diſmiſs'd.</note> But he reply'd, <hi>Do me Juſtice for my falſe Impriſonment all this while;</hi>
for he had been lock'd up, as was well known, in a wet and cold Room, and therefore he ſaid, <hi>I ought to be ſet at Liberty.</hi> At which the Judge ſaid, <hi>You are at Liberty,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Oath is tender'd, and he is indicted again.</note> 
               <hi>but
I will put the Oath to you again. G. F.</hi> then turning himſelf about, ſaid to the People, <hi>Take Notice, this is a Snare; but I ought to be ſet free from the Jailor, and from this Court.</hi> But

the Judge, inſtead of hearkening to that, cried, <hi>Give him the Book. G. F. then taking the Book, and looking in it, ſaid, <hi>I ſee it is a Bible, and I am glad of it.</hi> In the mean while the Jury being called by Order of the Judge, they ſtood by; for tho' they had deſired, after they had brought in their former Verdict, to be diſmiſs'd, yet he told them, <hi>He could not diſmiſs them yet, becauſe he ſhould have Buſineſs for them; and therefore they muſt attend, and be ready. G. F.</hi> perceiving his Intent, look<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d him in the Face, which made him bluſh: Nevertheleſs he cauſed the Oath to be read, and then ask'd <hi>G. F. Whether he would take the Oath or no?</hi> To which he ſaid, <hi>Ye have given me a Book here to kiſs, and to ſwear on; and this Book ſays,</hi> Kiſs the Son; <hi>and the Son ſaith in this Book,</hi> Swear not at all; <hi>and ſo ſays alſo the Apoſtle</hi> James: <hi>Now I ſay, as the Book ſays, and yet ye impriſon me, for doing as the Book bids me. How chance ye do not impriſon the Book for ſaying ſo? How comes it that the Book is at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty amongſt you, which bids me</hi> ſwear not? <hi>Why don't ye impriſon the Book alſo?</hi> Whilſt he was ſpeaking thus, he held up the Bible open, to ſhew the Place where Chriſt forbids ſwearing. But the Book was taken from him, and the Judge ſaid, <hi>No, but we will impriſon</hi> George Fox. This Caſe was ſo ſingular, that it was ſpread over all the Country, as a By-Word, <hi>That they gave</hi> G. Fox <hi>a Book, to ſwear on, that commanded him,</hi> not to ſwear at all; <hi>and that this Book,</hi> viz. <hi>the Bible, was at Liberty, and he in Priſon, for doing as the Bible ſaid:</hi> B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

For the whole World lies in Wickedneſs: But bring out your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Men, as ye call them, to convince me.</hi> Then the Sheriff and the Judge ſaid, <hi>That the Angel ſwore in the</hi> Revelations. To which <hi>G. Fox</hi> reply'd, <hi>When God bringeth in his Firſt-begotten Son into the World, he ſaith, Let all the Angels of God worſhip him; and he ſaid,</hi> Swear not at all. <hi>Nay,</hi> ſaid the Judge, <hi>I will not diſpute.</hi> Then he told the Jury, <q>It was for Chriſt's Sake that he could not ſwear; and therefore he warned them not to act contrary to that of God in their Conſciences, becauſe they muſt all appear before his Judgment-Seat.</q> After ſome more Words ſpoken, the Jailor took him away. And in the Afternoon, he was brought up again.<note place="margin">And brought in guilty.</note> The Jury having brought him in guilty of what he was charged with in the Indictment, <hi>viz.</hi> his not taking the Oath, the Judge asked him, <hi>What he had to ſay for himſelf.</hi> He then deſired the Indictment to be read; ſince he could not anſwer to that which he had not heard. The Clerk reading it, the Judge ſaid, <hi>Take Heed it be not falſe again.</hi> But the Clerk read it in ſuch a Manner, that <hi>G F.</hi> could hardly underſtand what he read. And when he had done, the Judge ask'd <hi>G. F. What he had to ſay to the Indictment?</hi> To which he ſaid, <hi>At once hearing ſo large a Writing read, and that at ſuch a Diſtance, that I could not diſtinctly hear all the Parts of it, I cannot well tell what to ſay to it: But if you will let me have a Copy of it, and give me Time to conſider, I ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it.</hi> This put the Court to a little Stand; but at length the Judge asked him, <hi>What Time he would have?</hi> And he anſwered, <hi>Till the next Aſſize. But,</hi> ſaid the Judge, <hi>what Plea will you make now? are you guilty, or not guilty?</hi> To which he replied, <hi>I am not guilty at all of denying ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obſtinately and wilfully: And as for thoſe Things mention'd in the Oath, as</hi>
                  <pb n="393" facs="unknown:003104_0404_0FEFF730B254F2E0"/>
jeſuitical Plots, <hi>and</hi> foreign Powers, <hi>I utterly deny them in my Heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And if I could take any Oath, I ſhould take this; but I never took any Oath in all my Life.</hi> To this the Judge returned, <hi>You ſay well;</hi> but the King is ſworn, the Parliament is ſworn, I am ſworn, the Juſtices are ſworn, and the Law is preſerved by Oaths.</hi> On which <hi>G. F.</hi> told him, <hi>They had had ſufficient Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of Mens ſwearing, and had ſeen how the Juſtices and Jury ſwore wrong the other Day:</hi> And continued he, <hi>if thou haſt read in the Book of Martyrs, how many of them did refuſe to ſwear, both within the Time of the ten Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, and in Biſhop</hi> Bonner's <hi>Day, thou may'ſt ſee that to deny ſwearing in Obedience to Chriſt's Command, is no new Thing.</hi> To this the Judge ſaid, <hi>He wiſh'd the Laws were otherwiſe.</hi> And <hi>G. F.</hi> ſaid then, <hi>Our Yea is Yea, and our Nay is Nay. And if we tranſgreſs our</hi> Yea <hi>and our</hi> Nay, <hi>let us ſuffer as they do, or ſhould do, that ſwear falſly. This I have offered to the King, and the King ſaid, it was reaſonable.</hi> After ſome farther Diſcourſe, <hi>G. F.</hi> was committed to Priſon again, and Colonel <hi>Kirby</hi> order'd the Jailor <hi>to keep him cloſe, and to ſuffer no Body to come to him, as one that was not fit to be diſcourſed with.</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is re-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and Colonel <hi>Kir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi>'s Cruelty to him.</note> The Jailor did not ſcruple to follow this Order, for he lock'd him up in a ſmoaky Tower, where the Smoke of the other Priſoners came up ſo thick, that ſometimes one could hardly ſee a burning Candle; ſo that there ſeemed to have been an Intent to choke him; for the Turnkey could harldly be perſuaded to unlock one of the upper Doors a little to let out the Smoke. Beſides this Hardſhip, in wet Weather it rained in upon his Bed to that Degree, that his Shirt grew wet. In this pitiful Condition he lay during a long cold Winter, which ſo afflicted him, that his Body ſwell'd, and his Limbs were much benumbed. Here we will leave him till he was brought again to his Trial, which was not before the next Year.</p>
            <p>But before I part with him, I muſt mention, that ſome Time before, he had written ſeveral Papers to the Emperor, the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and alſo to the Pope. Theſe Writings were by ſome Body elſe turned into <hi>Latin,</hi> and ſo given out in Print. In theſe he levell'd chiefly againſt Perſecution for Religion's Sake. He reproved the King of <hi>Spain</hi> more eſpecially, becauſe of the Inquiſition, and the burning of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: And he did not ſpare the Pope, as being the Spring of theſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, ſaying, <hi>Innocent Blood hath long cry'd for Vengeance to the Lord: The Earth almoſt ſwims with innocent Blood; and the Cry of it is heard. Your fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, Profeſſion, and your cold Winter-Images being ſet up in your Streets, the Lord God of Power and Dread, and of Heaven and Earth will be avenged on thee, and you all; his Day is approaching. Ye great and rich Cardinals and Pope, ye have been fed like fat Hogs; and ſeeing that thou would'ſt not receive the Lord's Meſſengers, but threw them in Priſon, and in your Inquiſition, it may be the Lord may give you a Viſit another Way, for his Dread is gone out, and his Zeal is kindled againſt you.— The Fields are ſprinkled with Blood of the Innocent, and ye are the Aceldama, or the Field of Blood. But the Lord is coming to take Vengeance upon you; his Hand is ſtretched over your Heads, and his Power is gone over you; with that he will rule you and ſmite you down, and bring you that are lofty from your S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ats, and abaſe your Pride, and take the Glory to himſelf.— How much Blood, which is unmeaſurable, and can't be meaſured here, have ye drank ſince the Days of the Apoſtles, and made your ſelves drunk with it! But now is the Indignation and Wrath of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty come and coming upon you; and thou Pope muſt feel it.— Tremble therefore, thou Pope, tremble, fear, and quake thou Pope, tremble ye Cardinals, tremble ye Jeſuits, tremble ye Priors, tremble ye Monks and Friars, of what Rank ſoever; for the Army of the Lord God is coming over you, by whom ye ſhall be ſhaken and daſhed to Pieces.</hi> Theſe are but ſmall Sparkles of that Flame which <hi>G. Fox</hi> blew againſt the Pope, intermixing his Writings with many Demonſtrations, that the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church was the Whore of
<pb n="394" facs="unknown:003104_0405_0FEFF6EBD23CF200"/>
               <hi>Babel,</hi> and that ſhe it was that had defiled her ſelf with Idolatry and Superſtition, and had bathed her ſelf in the Blood of the Saints, having furiouſly attacked them with Sword and Fire. This he concluded with theſe Words: <hi>The Plagues of God will be thy Portion, O Pope, who hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Nations: And all ye Jeſuits and Cardinals, howl, for your Miſery is coming, the mighty Day of the Lord God upon you all; the Lord God, who will be worſhipped in Spirit and in Truth, and with none of your Inventions.</hi> Thus <hi>G. Fox</hi> wrote in that Day to the Pope and his Counſellors; and no Wonder that he paid dear for this ſharp Language againſt the Head of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> for it may be believed, that a great many of the Court-party, in thoſe Days, were either conceal'd <hi>Papiſts,</hi> or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers of them: And yet among the national Clergy, and even thoſe of other Perſuaſions, many branded the <hi>Quakers</hi> with the odious Name of <hi>ſecret Papiſts,</hi> thereby to make them incur the Hatred of the People.</p>
            <p>Now I return to <hi>Francis Howgil,</hi>
               <note place="margin">F. Howgil<hi>'s Trial at</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleby, <hi>and Re-commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </note> whom in the foregoing Year we left in Priſon at <hi>Appleby.</hi> It was in the Forepart of this Year that he was brought to his Trial. Being come into Court before the Judges ſat, he ſpoke to the Clerk of the Aſſizes, and told him, <hi>He did not know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they expected his Appearance then or not:</hi> The Clerk ſaid, <hi>You have done well,</hi> and that he would acquaint the Judge, and he ſhould only engage to him to appear the next Aſſizes, to anſwer the Indictment againſt him, and that he ſhould not appear in Court; <hi>Francis</hi> bid do what he would. In the mean Time Sir <hi>Philip Muſgrave</hi> (ſo called) a great Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the Truth, and the great and chief Proſecutor of <hi>Francis,</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the Judges againſt him, <hi>as that he was a dangerous Perſon, a Ringleader and a Keeper up of Meetings of dangerous Conſequence, and deſtructive to the Peace of the Nation;</hi> ſo then they concluded he ſhould appear in Court; and ſo the Clerk informed him, and told him about what Time he ſhould be called: So the Court began; Judge <hi>Twiſden</hi> gave the Charge to the Grand Jury, in which he ſaid, <hi>There was a Sort of People, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Pretence of Conſcience and Religion, who ſeemed to build upon the King's Declarations from</hi> Breda, <hi>and under Colour of this, hatched Treaſons and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions,</hi> and gave the Jury Charge to enquire and preſent ſuch, that the Peace of the Nation might be preſerved; ſo they empannelled the Jury, and <hi>Francis</hi> was called to the Bar, and the Judge ſpake as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;</p>
            <p>Judge, ſpeaking calmly to him, ſaid, <hi>The Face of Things was much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered ſince the laſt Aſſizes,</hi> and made a large Speech to him and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, telling him, <hi>That all Sects under Pretence of Conſcience did violate the Laws, and hatched Rebellions, not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that I have any thing to charge you with; but ſeeing the Oath of Allegiance was tender'd to you the laſt Aſſizes, and you refuſed to take it, it was looked upon that ſuch Perſons were Enemies to the King and Government;</hi> and ſaid, <hi>I will not trouble you now to anſwer to your Indictment, but I muſt do that the next Aſſizes, in the mean Time you muſt enter into Recognizance for your good Behaviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which <hi>F. H.</hi> anſwered, I deſire Liberty to ſpeak; which he had without Interruption, and ſaid as followeth;</p>

               <hi>F. H.</hi> Judge <hi>Twiſden,</hi> thou very well knoweſt upon how ſlender an Account, or none, I was brought before thee the laſt Aſſizes, where thou wert pleaſed to tender me the Oath of Allegiance, tho' I believe both thee and the reſt of the Court did know it was a received Principle amongſt us not to ſwear at all; many Reaſons I gave thee then, many more I have to add, if I may have Audience; for it may appear to you an abſurd Thing, and Obſtinacy in me to refuſe it, if I ſhould not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Reaſon; I am (ſaid he) none of thoſe that make Religion a Cloak of Maliciouſneſs, nor Conſcience a Cloak to carry on Plots or Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies, the Lord hath redeemed me and many more out of ſuch Things;

and ſeeing I am engaged to appear at the next Aſſizes, I deſire no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Thing may be required of me.</p>
            <p>Judge. <hi>You muſt enter into Bond this dangerous Time, and therefore conſider of it, and tell me now, or before the Aſſizes end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Second Day of the Aſſizes he was called again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>F. H.</hi> Seeing thou art pleaſed to let me anſwer to my Indictment, which I am willing to do, I have been of good Behaviour, and ſhall ſo continue; but it ſeems a hard Thing to me, and full of Severity, that ſeeing I am obliged to appear to anſwer an Indictment of ſo high a Nature (if proſecuted againſt me) which tends to the Loſs of my Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for Life, and my Eſtate for ever, I hope the Court will not envy my Liberty for five Months.</p>
            <p>Judge <hi>Turner</hi> ſaid, <hi>We do not deſire your Impriſonment, if you will be of good Behaviour.</hi>

            <p>And <hi>F. H.</hi> preſſed further that they would not put him upon giving Bond to be of good Behaviour, knowing himſelf to be bound by the Truth, that he could not mis-behave himſelf.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Daniel Flemming,</hi> another perſecuting Juſtice, had framed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Indictment againſt him for meeting, and ſtood up (fearing the Snare of giving Bond would not hold) and ſaid as followeth;</p>

               <hi>F. H.</hi> Said, he had nothing to accuſe himſelf of, for his Conſcience bore him Witneſs that he loved Peace, and ſought it with all Men.</p>
            <p>Judges both ſpake, <hi>What do you tell of Conſcience? we meddle not with it, but you contemn the Laws, and keep up great Meetings, and go not to Church.</hi>

From his Childhood he was inclined to be religious, and ſeeking after the beſt Things, he joined with thoſe that were the moſt ſtrict in performing religious Duties. And having afterwards heard <hi>G.

By this letter it appears, that there was an endeared mutual Love between this virtuous Couple. He was a Man of great Knowledge, but when his Underſtanding came to be opened by the preaching at <hi>G. Fox,</hi> he would ſay ſometimes, <hi>Ah, what have
we been doing! or what availeth our great Profeſſion? All our Building tumbles down; our Profeſſion is high as the Wind; the Day of the Lord is upon it, and his Word as a Fire conſumes it as dry Stubble; and puts an End to all empty Profeſſions and high Notions, without Life or Subſtance; to all the Wiſdom of fallen Man. We muſt forſake the World, and all its Glory; it is all but Vanity and Vexation of Spirit: It is a Saviour that I long for, it is him that my Soul pants after. O that I may be gathered into his Life, and overſhadowed with his Glory, ſanctified through out by his Word, and raiſed up by his eternal Power!</hi> He continuing in this State of daily Supplication and inward Travel of Soul, it pleaſed the Lord at length to furniſh him with an extraordinary Qualification to proclaim his Word, which he did ſome Years faithfully and with great Zeal. And tho' his Wife loved him dearly, and preferred his Company above what the World could give, yet in Regard of his Goſpel Service, ſhe gave him up freely to be much from home; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by during a great Part of the Time of their Marriage, ſhe had not his deſirable Company.

To his Wife, who was big with Child, and nigh her Delivery, and well knowing how tenderly ſhe loved him, he ſaid, <hi>My Will is in true Subjection ſubmitting to the Will of the Lord, whether Life or Death; and therefore give me up freely to his diſpoſing.</hi> And ſhe, how dear ſoever he was to her, did ſo; which gave him ſome Eaſe, ſeeing her ſincere Reſignedneſs; and being ſometimes overcome with Joy, he praiſed God in his Sickneſs; nay ſo ardent was his Zeal, that once, tho' very weak, he deſired to be helped up in Bed upon his Knees; and thus he fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently ſupplicated
the Lord in the Behalf of his Churches, <hi>That they might be preſerved in the Truth, out of the Evil of the World, and that his Goſpel might ſpread, and be publiſhed to the gathering of all that pertain to</hi> Iſrael. His Strength now diminiſhing daily, he ſweetly departed at the Age of thirty four Years, about three Weeks after the Fever firſt ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed him. And his Widow, who ten Days after his Deceaſe was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of a Son, behaved her ſelf diſcreetly, and ſaid afterwards in a Paper concerning him; <hi>The eternal God, who by his Providence joined us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in Marriage in our young Days, in his bleſſed Counſel alſo cauſed his Day to ſpring from on high upon us: In the marvellous Light, and bright ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning whereof, he revealed his Son Chriſt in us, and gave us Faith to believe in him the eternal Lord of Life, by which our Souls came to be quickened and made alive in him; and alſo in and by the quickning of his holy Power, we were made one in a ſpiritual and heavenly Relation, our Hearts being knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the unſpeakable Love of Truth, which was our Life, Joy, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and made our Days together exceeding comfortable, as being that whereby all our temporal Enjoyments were ſanctified, and made a Bleſſing to us — How hard it was, and how great a Loſs, to part with ſo dear and tender an Husband as he was to me, as far beyond what I can expreſs; the Dolour of my Heart, my

That he did neither in Wilfulneſs nor Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy refuſe it, being ſenſible of the Damage that would come thereby, if they did proſecute him upon that Statute, he having a Wife and Children, and ſome ſmall Eſtate which he knew lay at Stake in the Matter; but that tho' it were his Life alſo, he could not revolt from, or deny that which he had moſt certainly believed in: But if any could convince him, either by Scripture or Reaſon, he had an Ear to hear. And therefore all thoſe Things conſidered, he deſired he might be diſmiſs'd from his Bonds, and from their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of him upon that Account.</q> Theſe Papers were delivered to the Judges and Juſtices before he appeared in Court; and were read by them.

H.</hi> ſaid, I ſhall: In the Mouth of two or three Witneſſes every Truth is confirm'd; and we never denied to give, and ſtill are ready to give Evidence for the King wherein we are concern'd, and in any other Matter for the ending of Strife between Man and Man in Truth and Righteouſneſs, and this anſwers the Subſtance of the Law.</p>
            <p>Judge. <hi>Is this a good Anſwer, think you? whether to be given with or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Oath? The Law requires an Oath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>F. H.</hi> Still Evidence is and may be given in Truth, according to the Subſtance of the Law, ſo that no Detriment cometh unto any Party, ſeeing that true Teſtimony may be born without an Oath; and I did not ſpeak of changing the Law: Yet ſeeing we never refuſed giving Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, which anſwereth the Intent and Subſtance of the Law, I judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it was reaſonable to receive our Teſtimony, and not to expoſe us to ſuch Sufferings, ſeeing we ſcrupled an Oath only upon a conſciencious Account, in Tenderneſs of our Conſciences, for Fear of breaking the Command of Chriſt, the Saviour of the World, which if we do, there is none of you able to plead our Cauſe for us with him.</p>
            <p>Judge. <hi>But why do you not go to Church, but meet in Houſes and private Conventicles, which the Law forbids.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>F. H.</hi> We meet together only for the Worſhip of the true God in Spirit and Truth, having the primitive Chriſtians for our Example, and to no other End, but that we may be edified, and God glorified, and when two or three are met together in the Name of Chriſt, and he in the midſt of them, there is a Church.</p>
            <p>Judge. <hi>That is true: But how long is it ſince you have been at Church? Or will you go to the Church the Law doth allow of? Give me ſome Reaſons why you do not go.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>F. H.</hi> I have many to give thee, if them haſt Patience to hear me:

               <hi>1ſt,</hi> God dwells not in Temples made with Mens Hands, <hi>2dly,</hi> The Pariſh-Houſe hath been a Temple for Idols, <hi>to wit,</hi> for the Maſs and the Rood; and I dare have no Fellowſhip with Idols, nor worſhip in Idols Temples; for what have we to do with Idols, their Temples, and Worſhip?</p>

            </sp>
            <p>
               <hi>F. H.</hi> Yes, under the Law; but the Chriſtians, who believed in Chriſt, ſeparated from theſe (and the Temple was made and left deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <sp>
               <speaker>Judge.</speaker>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>I know not what it is, I never heard it, tho' I have often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired a Copy.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>F. H.</speaker>
               <p>I deny it.</p>

               <p>The Indictment.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Judge.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Did you not deny to ſwear? and the Indictment convicts you that you did not ſwear.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F. H.</speaker>
               <p>I gave unto the Court the Subſtance of the Oath, as you all know <hi>2dly,</hi> I told you I did not deny it out of Obſtinacy or Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs neither in Contempt of the King's Law or Government; for my Will would rather chooſe my Liberty, than Bonds; and I am ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible it is like to be a great Damage to me; I have a Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and ſome Eſtate, which we might ſubſiſt upon, and do Good to others, and I know all this lies at Stake; but if it were my Life alſo, I durſt not but do as I do, leſt I ſhould incur the Diſpleaſure of God; and do you judge I would loſe my Liberty wilfully, and ſuffer the Spoiling of my Eſtate, and the ruining of my Wife and Children in Obſtinacy and Wilfulneſs? Sure nay.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Judge.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jury, You ſee he denies the Oath, and he will not plead to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment, only excepts againſt it becauſe of the Form of Words; but you ſee he will not ſwear, and yet he ſaith he denies the Indictment, and you ſee upon what Ground.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <p>And then they called the Jailor to witneſs and ſwear, that the laſt Aſſizes <hi>F. H.</hi> did refuſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which he did; and the Jury, without go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Bar, gave in their Verdict, Guilty, and then the Court broke up that Night.</p>
            <p>The next Day towards Evening, when they had tried all the Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>Francis</hi> was brought to the Bar to receive his Sentence.</p>
            <p>Judge ſtood up, and ſaid, <hi>Come, the Indictment is proved againſt you, what have you to ſay why Sentence ſhall not be given?</hi>
            </p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F. H.</speaker>
               <p>I have many Things to ſay, if you will hear them: <hi>1ſt,</hi> As I have ſaid, I denied not out of Obſtinacy or Wilfulneſs, but was willing to teſtify the Truth in this Matter of Obedience, or any other Matter wherein I was concerned: <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe Swearing was directly againſt the Command of Chriſt. <hi>3dly,</hi> Againſt the Doctrine of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. <hi>4thly,</hi> Even ſome of your principal Pillars of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and;</hi> as Biſhop <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> ſome Time Primate of <hi>Ireland,</hi> he ſaid in his Works, <hi>The</hi> Waldenſes <hi>did deny all ſwearing in their Age, from that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt and the Apoſtle</hi> James, <hi>and it was a ſufficient Ground;</hi> and Dr. <hi>Gauden,</hi> late Biſhop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> in a Book of his I lately read, he cited very many ancient Fathers, to ſhew, that the firſt three hundred
<pb n="402" facs="unknown:003104_0413_0FEFF6F6F2CD8228"/>Years Chriſtians did not ſwear, ſo that it is no new Doctrine.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>To which the Court ſeemed to give a little Ear, and ſaid nothing, but talked one to another, and <hi>Francis</hi> ſtood ſilent, and then the Judge ſaid,</p>

               <speaker>Judge.</speaker>
               <p>

               <speaker>Judge.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Will you ſay upon your honeſt Word they denied all Swearing?</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>F. H.</speaker>
               <p>What I have ſaid is true.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Judge.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Why do you not come to Church, and bear Service, and be ſubject to the Law, and to every Ordinance of Man for the Lord's Sake?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F. H.</speaker>
               <p>We are ſubject, and for that Cauſe we do pay Taxes, Tribute and Cuſtom, <hi>and give unto</hi> Caeſar <hi>the Things that are his, and unto God the Things that are his,</hi> to wit, Worſhip, Honour and Obedience; and if thou mean the Pariſh-Aſſembly, I tell thee faithfully, I am perſuaded, and upon good Ground, their Teachers are not the Miniſters of Chriſt, neither their Worſhip the Worſhip of God.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Judge.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Why; it may be for ſome ſmall Things in the Service, you reject it all.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F. H.</speaker>
               <p>Firſt, it is manifeſt they are Time-ſervers, one while preaching up that for Divine Service to People that another while they cry down, as Popiſh, Superſtitious and Idolatrous; and that which they have preached up twenty Years together, make Shipwreck of all in a Day, and now again call it divine, and would have all compelled to that themſelves once made void.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Judge.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Why; never ſince the King came in.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F. H.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, the ſame Men that preached it down once, now cry it up; ſo they are ſo unſtable and wavering, that we cannot believe they are the Miniſters of Chriſt. <hi>Secondly,</hi> They teach for Hire, and live by forced Maintenance, and would force a Faith upon Men, contrary to Chriſt and the Apoſtle's Rule, who would have every one perſwaded in their own Minds, and ſaid, <hi>Whatſoever is not of Faith is Sin,</hi> and yet they ſay, <hi>Faith is the Gift of God,</hi> and we have no ſuch Faith given; but yet they would force theirs upon us, and becauſe we cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, they cry, <hi>You are not ſubject to Authority and the Laws,</hi> and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Confiſcations, Impriſonment and Baniſhment is threatned, and this is their greateſt Plea, I could mention more Particulars.— Then the Judge interrupted.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Judge.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Well, I ſee you will not ſwear, nor conform, nor be ſubject, and you think we deal ſeverely with you, but if you would be ſubject, we ſhould not need.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>F.H.</speaker>
               <p>I do ſo judge indeed, that you deal ſeverely with us for Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Commands of Chriſt; I pray thee, canſt thou ſhew me how that any of thoſe People for whom the Act was made, have been proceeded aginſt by this Statute, tho' I envy no Man's Liberty.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Judge.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oh, Yes, I can inſtance you many up and down the Country that are premunired, I have done it my ſelf, pronounced Sentence againſt divers.</hi>

               <p>What againſt Papiſts?</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>F. H.</speaker>
               <p>What, againſt the <hi>Quakers?</hi> ſo I have heard indeed; ſo then that Statute which was made againſt Papiſts, thou' let'ſt them alone, and executeſt it againſt the <hi>Quakers.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Judge.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Well, You will meet in great Numbers, and do increaſe, but there is a new Statute which will make you fewer.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F. H.</speaker>
               <p>Well, if we muſt ſuffer, it is for Chriſt's Sake, and for well-doing.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>
               <hi>Francis</hi> then being ſilent, the Judge pronounced the Sentence, but ſpake ſo low, that the Priſoner tho' near to him, could ſcarce hear it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="403" facs="unknown:003104_0414_0FEFF73C6857AEB8"/>The Sentence was, <hi>You are put out of the King's Protection and the Benefit of the Law, your Lands are confiſcate to the King during your Life; and your Goods and Chattels for ever, and you to be Priſoner during your Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F. H.</speaker>
               <p>A hard sentence for my Obedience to the Commands of Chriſt; the Lord forgive you all.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>So he turned from the Bar; but the Judge ſpeaking, he turned again, and many more Words paſſed to the ſame Purpoſe, as before; at laſt the judge roſe up and ſaid,</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Judge.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Well, If you will yet be ſubject to the Laws, the King will ſhew you Mercy.</hi>

               <p>The Lord hath ſhewed Mercy unto me, and I have done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt the King, nor Government, nor any Man, bleſſed be the Lord, and therein ſtands my Peace; for it is for Chriſt's Sake ſuffer, and not for Evil-doing. And ſo the Court broke up. The People were generally moderate, and many were ſorry to ſee what was done againſt him; but <hi>Francis</hi> ſignified how contented and glad he was, that he had any Thing to loſe for the Lord's precious Truth, of which he had publickly born Teſtimony, and that he was now counted worthy to ſuffer for it.</p>

            <p>A learned Man at <hi>London,</hi> of what Perſuaſion I know not, put forth a little Book in Relation to this Act, wherein he ſhewed from the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> the Abſurdity of it, ſince all religious Acts exerciſed by ſix Perſons, not according to the Formality of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> were forbidden; and that at this Rate it might be reckon'd a Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, if a Woman being in Travel, and in Danger of Life, one of the Company ſaid a Prayer; or if any one ſpoke ſomething to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the near Relations of a deceaſed Perſon; or prayed for the Health or Happineſs of a young married Couple, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by which it might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, that ſome by the Malice of their Enemies, might not only incur Impriſonment for three Months, but alſo by Virtue of the Act of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, might be condemned to Tranſportation. That this was not without Danger,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Orlando Bridgeman's</hi> Advice to a Jury on the Act.</note> did appear ſufficiently by what Judge <hi>Orlando Bridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> ſaid at <hi>Hertford</hi> to the Jury, viz. <hi>You are not to expect a plain punctual Evidence againſt them for any Thing they ſaid or did at their Meeting; for they may ſpeak to one another, tho' not with or by auricular Sound, but by a Caſt of the Eye, or a Motion of the Head or Foot, or Geſture of the Body. So that if you find or believe in your Hearts that they were in the Meeting under Colour of Religion in their Way, tho' they ſat ſtill only and lookt upon each other, it was an unlawful Meeting.</hi> At this Rate the Jury-men, who ought to be impartial Judges, or Mediators, were ſwayed, ſo that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Fear they might find the <hi>Quakers</hi> that were met together, guilty of tranſgreſſing the Law.</p>
            <p>Now ſince at that Time they were reſolved to baniſh the <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſo called, <hi>George Whitehead</hi> publiſh'd a little Book, in which he ſhewed the Unreaſonableneſs of the Perſecutors, and alſo ſtrengthened his Friends

                     <hi>G. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> writes againſt Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</note> and ſo not fall under the Laſh of the Law; for if they did not meet above five in Number, they kept without the Reach of the Law; and by keeping private Meetings, they might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo acquit their Conſciences before God.</q> But to this <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>That it might have been objected to the Prophet</hi> Daniel, <hi>that he might have prayed ſecretly, and not with open Windows and thrice a Day, after king</hi> Darius <hi>had ſigned the Decree,</hi> That whoſoever ſhould ask a Petition of any God or Man for thirty Days, ſave of the King, he ſhould be caſt into the Den of Lions;<hi>but that</hi> Daniel, <hi>notwithſtanding this Decree, had continued to pray to God as before. Since then,</hi> ſaid G. Whitehead, <hi>our Meetings are kept in Obedience to the Lord God, and according to the Freedom he hath given us, we may not leave off our Teſtimony for God in that Caſe; but we muſt be faithful to him, whatever we ſuffer on that Account. For neither the Threatnings of Men, nor their Severity or Cruelty acted againſt us, how far ſoever it may be extended, can make us to forſake the Lord in not keeping our Aſſemblies, or to be aſhamed of Chriſt before Men, leſt hereafter he be aſhamed of us before His Father which is in Heaven.</hi> Beſides he ſhewed, <hi>How unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable it was to incite the Jury on an ill-grounded Suſpicion, without leaving them the Liberty of their own Judgment:</hi> And the Judges he ſhewed <hi>their Duty from the Law, and</hi> Magna Charta. He alſo ſhewed <hi>how unequal it was, that Soldiers, who abuſed his Friends in their Meetings, ſhould be called as Witneſſes againſt them; and that they ſhould be lock'd up with Thieves and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons, ſince this was contrary to the Right of a freeborn</hi> Engliſhman. But this Repreſentation of <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> was ſlighted, ſince they were reſolved to go on with baniſhing of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and to tranſport them to the <hi>Weſt-Indies;</hi> which however, according to the ancient Laws, might not be done to a freeborn <hi>Engliſhman</hi> againſt his Mind.<note place="margin">As doth alſo <hi>J.

               </note> eight of thoſe called <hi>Quakers,</hi> viz. <hi>Francis Prior, Nicholas Lucas, Henry Feaſt, Henry Marſhal, Jeremy Hern, Thomas Wood, John Blendale,</hi> and <hi>Samuel Trahern,</hi> were tried at <hi>Hertford</hi> before Judge <hi>Orlando Bridgeman,</hi> already mentioned: The Indictment contained, <hi>That they had been at an unlawful Meeting, under Colour and Pretence of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:</hi> And the Witneſſes declared, <hi>That they had met together above the Number of Five, and were taken at ſuch Times, and ſuch Places;</hi> for they muſt have tranſgreſſed thrice before they could be condemned to Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But the Witneſſes declared alſo, <hi>That they neither heard them ſpeak any Words, nor ſaw them do any thing at their Meeting, but ſit ſtill.</hi> The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment having been delivered to the Grand Jury, they could not agree in their Verdict; for there were ſome amongſt them whoſe Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces would not give them Leave to be acceſſary to this Work of Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; and therefore they brought in their Verdict <hi>Ignoranius.</hi> Now tho' ſuch a Verdict as this ought not to be rejected, yet Judge <hi>Bridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> ſtanding up, and ſeeming to be angry, ſpoke to the Jury after this Manner:<note place="margin">The Judge's partial Speeches and Behaviour.</note>

Then Four of the Priſoners were called to the Bar, their Indictment read, and they
<pb n="411" facs="unknown:003104_0422_0FEFF749197B6448"/>
ask'd, <hi>Guilty,</hi> or <hi>Not Guilty?</hi> To which they anſwered, <hi>Not guilty, and that they had tranſgreſſed no juſt Law. But,</hi> ſaid the Judge, <hi>ye have tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed this Law,</hi> [having the Act in his Hand,] <hi>and ye have been twice convicted already upon Record, and if ye are found guilty by the Jury this Time, I muſt paſs the Sentence of Tranſportation upon you. Now therefore ye ſhall ſee that we do not deſire to ſtrain the Law to the higheſt Severity; neither do I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that it was the Aim of the Law-makers, to be ſevere, but for conforming. If ye will promiſe that ye will not go, or be at any more ſuch Meetings, I will ſhew you this Favour, as to acquit you for what is paſt: This Favour ye may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive before the Jury is charged with you; but afterwards I cannot do it. And know alſo, if the Jury for Want of punctual Evidence, ſhould not find you guilty, yet if ye are taken again, ye will be in the ſame Caſe ye now are in. What ſay you? Will ye promiſe to meet no more?</hi> To this the Priſoners anſwered, <hi>They could promiſe no ſuch Thing.</hi> Then a Jury was called, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment read a ſecond Time, containing, <hi>That the Priſoners had been at an unlawfull Meeting at ſuch a Time and Place, the firſt, ſecond, and third Time.</hi> The Witneſſes being called, gave the ſame Evidence as before; and then the Judge ſaid thus to the Jury, <hi>My Maſters, the Jury, ye hear what Evidence the Witneſſes give; how they took them at ſuch Times, at ſuch Places, which are Places they uſe to meet in; and that they were above the Number of Five, beſides the Perſons of the Family where they met; and that they are twice convicted already upon Record: And this is the third Offence, which incurs the Sentence of Tranſportation, if ye find them guilty.</hi> Then he ſpoke thoſe Words which have been mention'd already, viz. <hi>Ye are not to expect a plain punctual Evidence againſt them for any Thing they ſaid or did at their Meeting,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for dumb Men may ſpeak to one another, ſo as they may underſtand each other by Signs: And they themſelves ſay, that the Worſhip of God is inward, in the Spirit, and that they can diſcern Spirits, and know one another in Spirit. So that if ye find or believe in your Hearts that they were in the Meeting, under Colour of Religion in their Way, tho' they ſat ſtill only — It was an unlawful Meeting, and their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe and Practice not according to the Liturgy of the Church of</hi> England; <hi>for it allows and commands when People meet together in the Church, that Divine Service ſhall be read,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And ye muſt find the Bill; for ye muſt have Reſpect to the Meaning and Intent of the Law, which the King and Parliament have in Wiſdom and Policy made, not only againſt Conventicles, but the Words</hi> Aſſembly <hi>and</hi> Meeting <hi>were added; for we have had late Experience of the Danger of ſuch Meetings under Colour of Religion: And it is an eaſy Matter at ſuch Meetings to conſpire and conſult Miſchief. Therefore the Wiſdom and Policy of the King and Parliament, leſt they ſhould be undermined, have made this Law, which is not a Law againſt Conſcience, for it doth not touch Conſcience at all, as I confeſs ſome other Laws do, which enjoin coming to Church,<note place="margin">Four of them by the Judges Management are found guilty, and ſentenced to be tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does.</hi>

<pb n="412" facs="unknown:003104_0423_0FEFF705E672AE90"/>
and he having thus obtained his Aim, read the Priſoners Names, and ſaid to them, <hi>What can ye ſay for your ſelves, that Judgment of Tranſportation ſhould not paſs, or be given againſt you?</hi> To which they ſaid, <hi>We are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, and have tranſgreſſed no juſt Law; if we muſt have that Sentence, we give up our Bodies freely into the Hands of the Lord; the Will of the Lord be done.

What ſay you,</hi> (thus he continued) <hi>will ye have it deferred till the next Aſſizes? For if the Jury find the Bill, you will be ſent to</hi> Jamaica; <hi>ye muſt not all go to one Place.</hi> To this the Priſoners returned, <hi>We have tranſgreſſed no Law of God, nor wronged any Man: We leave it to the Court; we deſire it not. If you will not deſire it,</hi> replied the Judge, <hi>I cannot, nor will do it.</hi> Then three other Priſoners were brought to the Bar, among whom was one <hi>John Reynolds,</hi> who, according to the Depoſition of the Witneſſes, had been within a Yard of the Door of the Meeting place, with his Face fromwards it. The Judge then ſaid, <hi>God forbid that I ſhould do any thing that is not right and juſt againſt my Conſcience; there is that which is written upon the Wall before me, which puts me in Mind, that I ſhould not judge for Man, but for God.</hi> Then turning to the Jury, he ſpoke to them almoſt after the ſame Manner, as he did concerning the other four Priſoners; and to induce them to declare <hi>Reynolds</hi> (who was taken but not in the Meeting) <hi>guilty,</hi> he ſpoke thus, <q>Suppoſe a Man be killed in a Houſe, and no body ſaw him killed, but a Man is met coming out of the Houſe with a bloody Knife in his Hand, it is a very probable Evidence that he is guilty of the Murder. So tho' the Witneſſes do not ſay that they ſaw and took him in the Meeting, yet they ſwore he was within a Yard of the Door with his Face fromwards the Place where they uſually met; and he hath been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken twice already, and convicted upon Record. My Maſters, I leave it to you, go forth.</q> Then a Bailiff was called, and charged to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Jury a Room, and to let none ſpeak with them, nor to let them have either Bread, Drink, or Candle, till they brought in their Verdict. The Jury being gone out, ſoon agreed, and after they were returned,<note place="margin">Four of them found guilty, and ſentenced to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica,</hi> but <hi>Reynolds</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted.</note> ſaid, <hi>That four of the five Priſoners were guilty, and that the other who ſtood without the Door was not guilty.</hi> So he was acquitted; but the other four being brought to the Bar, the Judge asked them, <hi>What they could ſay why Judgment of Tranſportation ſhould not be given againſt them?</hi> Their Anſwer was, <hi>We are innocent, and have not offended any juſt Law of God or Man, to deſerve that Sentence; we leave it to the Witneſs of God in thy or your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences.</hi> Then the Judge ſaid, <hi>Ye have offended againſt this Law</hi> (having

And he himſelf conſidering how after having lain long in the <hi>Downs,</hi> and more than once ſet Sail, they were hindred to go on by contrary Winds, reſolved at length, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lingred about Two Months, to let the Baniſhed aſhore; and ſo he did, giving them a Certificate, of which I have a Copy in my Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that they were not run away, but freely put aſhore by him, for which among others he gave theſe Reaſons, <q>That ſeeing the great Adverſities they had met with, he concluded from thence, that the Hand of God was againſt him, and that therefore he durſt not go off with theſe Priſoners, becauſe he found them to be honeſt Men, who had not deſerved Baniſhment. And alſo that there was a Law extant, that no <hi>Engliſhman</hi> might be tranſported againſt his Mind. And that his Men refuſed to proceed on the Voyage if he would carry away theſe People.</q> This Certificate he gave under his Hand, and ſo let them go away free; and not long after the Ship ſet Sail with a fair Wind.

                  <p>THE God of Heaven hath put it into my Heart to write a few Words unto you, in the Fear and Dread of his Name, and in the Counſel of his own Will, concerning the Work which ye have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in hand againſt him and his People; this is not the End and Work for which the Lord God hath permitted you into the Places of <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Rule,</hi> in theſe Nations (nor the Way for you to proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, nor to prolong your Days in the Earth) thus to <hi>perſecute</hi> and <hi>afflict</hi> an <hi>innocent</hi> and <hi>harmleſs People,</hi> who are peaceable, and walk up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly (towards God and Man) therein, endeavouring (in all Things) <hi>to keep their Conſciences void of Offence,</hi> and who have no Helper in the Earth but the Lord alone; neither is their Kingdom of this World, but they are verily the Children and Servants of the Moſt High God, whom he hath gathered from amongſt Men, and from the Kindreds of the Earth, to be the firſt Fruits unto him, and to the Lamb in this Age; and we are his, and not our own, he hath bought us, and redeemed us unto himſelf, and to him alone have we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted our innocent Cauſe, and he hath undertaken to plead it for us, with all our Adverſaries; and <hi>No Weapon formed againſt us ſhall ever proſper, but be broken to Pieces.</hi>

                  <p>Therefore Friends, be awakened and open your Eyes, and ſee what a Stir and ado here is in this Nation, to hale and drag up and down a Company of <hi>tender, innocent, and harmleſs People, Men and Women, and Children from their peaceable Meetings,</hi> who meet together in the Fear and tender Love of God, without any evil or bad Intent toward any, but have Goodwill and Compaſſion toward all Men, even to the <hi>worſt of our Enemies,</hi> as the Lord bears us Witneſs, and theſe are them that are driven as Sheep to the Slaughter, and thrown into your noiſome Jails, and Priſons, and Houſes of Correction, by rude and brutiſh People (your Servants) whom you have ſet on Work by your Authority, till many of them have <hi>(patiently) ſuffered till Death, whoſe innocent Blood will aſſuredly be required at your Hands,</hi> (tho' they ſhall not go free of the Guilt, who have had the leaſt Hand in it, without ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Repentance.

               </gap>reſolute Condition ſhe continued a long Time; and being incumbred with the Cares of the Family, ſhe was not ſo much at Liberty for performing

religious Duties (<hi>viz.</hi> Prayers, reading of, and meditating on the Holy Scriptures, viſiting the Sick, and ſuch like pious Exerciſes) as ſhe was before ſhe was married; which made her wiſh ſometimes ſhe had never entred into Matrimony, and that ſhe might live to enjoy again that Peace and Quiet which once ſhe had. But ſhe knew not yet that it was the Love of the Lord thus working upon her, to draw her off from tranſitory Things. In this State ſhe was often ſeized with Grief and Sorrow, ſo that ſhe counted her ſelf the moſt miſerable of Women; for neither Husband, nor Children, nor any outward Enjoyments, could afford her any Pleaſure; but all her Deſire was to attain to an unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed State, in which ſhe might live an unblameable Life, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Men, but alſo before God: For feeling there was yet ſomething in her which was evil and polluting, ſhe ſtruggled to overcome it; but all her Labour proved in vain. This made her cry earneſtly to the Lord as one in great Danger; and her Doubts, whether it was poſſible to attain to Perfection, encreaſed. But in this forlorn State it pleaſed the Lord to manifeſt himſelf to her in ſome Meaſure, tho' ſhe knew not then it was he. And often ſhe cry'd out, <hi>Lord, what will it avail me to know that thou haſt ſent thy Son into the World, and that he was crucified and died for the Sins of the World, if I am not ſaved by it. Lord, forgive my Sins, and have Mercy upon me.</hi> And once when ſhe was alone, pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out her Heart before the Lord, he made himſelf known to her, and ſpoke to her Soul, <hi>That if ſhe would be perfect, ſhe muſt follow the Light in every Reſpect.</hi> Having heard this, ſhe deſired to know what this <hi>Light was;</hi> and the Lord ſhewed her, <hi>That the Life was the Light of Men.</hi> This ſhe underſtood in ſome Degree, and ſo ſeparated herſelf as much as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhe could conveniently from Converſation, endeavouring to live re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiredly. And having about this Time heard Dr. <hi>Galenus Abrahamſz,</hi> an eminent <hi>Baptiſt</hi> Teacher, preach upon the Parable of the Seedſman, that which he ſpoke concerning the good Ground, and how the Ground muſt be fitted by the Lord's Working, ſo affected her, that ſhe reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to reſt from all her own Labour; and ſo ſhe left frequenting the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> Aſſemblies any more.</p>
            <p>In this retired State ſhe continued a good while, and at length came to hear <hi>William Ames</hi> preach; and he declaring the Light of Chriſt as the true Teacher, this agreed with what had already been told her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly by the immediate Manifeſtations of the Lord to her. And thus ſhe came fully to be convinced that this was the Truth ſhe had ſo long deſired to know. Now ſhe ſaw that it was her Duty to give up all, and to keep nothing back: For ſhe had already ſeen, that if ſhe would be Chriſt's Diſciple, ſhe muſt forſake all, even her own ſelf. But a Fear of the Croſs was no ſmall Impediment to her; yet now ſhe gave up to Obedience; and ſaw that her former Performances had been defective; and now all came into Remembrance. This cauſed Sorrow; but ſhe prayed to the Lord both Night and Day, and then he manifeſted his Power by which ſhe was led out of the Darkneſs and Bondage, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhe had been held Captive; and her Supplication was to the Lord, that it might not be with her as formerly, to wit, ſometimes great Zeal, and then Coldneſs again; but that ſhe might continue in Fervency of Spirit. After a long Time of Mourning the Lord manifeſted his Kindneſs to her, by which ſhe came to be quickned and refreſhed; and by the Judgments of the Lord all was narrowly ſearched out; ſo that nothing could be hid; and a Separation was made between the precious and the vile, and Death paſſed over all. But thus to part with all her own Wiſdom, and forſake her great Attainments, was no ſmall Croſs; yet ſhe became willing to bear it, altho' many violent Tempeſts roſe to draw her off, if poſſible, from cloſe adhering to the Beloved of her
<pb n="426" facs="unknown:003104_0437_0FEFF718AE7D61E8"/>
Soul; yet ſhe was not forward in Imitation: For my Father, who when he was convinced of the Truth preached by <hi>W. Ames,</hi> and <hi>W. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> ſoon left off the common Way of Salutation, would ſometimes perſwade her by Arguments to do ſo too: But ſhe told him, if the leaving off of that Cuſtom was a Thing the Lord required, ſhe believed he would ſhew it her in his own Time, becauſe ſhe was given up to follow his Requirings. And ſo the Lord did in due Time; and ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing zealouſly faithful, he was pleaſed after my Father's Death to give her a publick Teſtimony, and ſhe became eminently gifted: For her natural Abilities ſurpaſſing the ordinary Qualifications of her Sex, and becoming ſanctified by the Spirit of the Lord, could not but produce good Effects; and ſhe came to be much viſited and ſought to by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors; and the Fifth-Monarchy-Men applauded her, becauſe of her pathetical Admonitions. But ſhe was above Flattery, and trampled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. Nay, ſhe was ſo well eſteemed, that I remember, having ſome Movings to viſit the Collegians in their Meeting, after one of them had left off ſpeaking, ſhe ſtood up, and ſaid, <q>That ſhe had ſomething upon her Mind to ſpeak to them by Way of Exhortation. But knowing that they ſuffered not Women to ſpeak amongſt them, ſhe was not willing bluntly to intrude her ſelf; but deſired their Leave;</q> which they readily granted, and one of their chief Speakers ſaid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o her, <hi>It is true, Friend, we don't allow Women to ſpeak in the Church; Yet we bear that Reſpect to you, that we give you the Liberty of ſpeaking.</hi> And then ſhe cleared her ſelf, having formerly been a Frequenter of that Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. And when ſhe had done ſpeaking, I don't remember ſhe was contradicted by any; but one of their Speakers concluded the Meeting with a Prayer.</p>
            <p>Before that Time, ſhe writ and publiſhed a ſmall Book to thoſe of her former Society, which ſhe called, <hi>A Serious Reproof of the Flemiſh Baptiſts;</hi> in which ſhe dealt very plainly with them; and ſhewed how they were apoſtatized. She writ alſo ſome other Treatiſes, extant in Print; and was much beloved and well eſteemed by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Friends, as appears by ſeveral Letters written to her from <hi>England,</hi> and yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. Thoſe of her own Nation often reſorted to her for Inſtruction, ſhe being ſo well exerciſed in the Way of the Lord, that ſhe was able to ſpeak a Word in Seaſon to various Conditions. Many Times ſhe viſited the Meetings at <hi>Alkmaar, Harlem,</hi> and <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> and was often invited by her Friends to come and edify them with her Gift. She writ alſo many Letters for Edification and Admonition to particular Perſons, and ſome Epiſtles alſo to the Church. But it pleaſed the Lord to take her early to himſelf. When ſhe fell ſick, ſhe ſoon had a Senſe that ſhe was not like to recover, and therefore ſpoke much to me in private, and acquainted me with ſeveral Things touching my ſelf, and relating to her outward Eſtate. And the Night before ſhe departed, ſhe called me to her Bed-ſide, and exhorted me very fervently to depart from Evil, and to fear the Lord; which by the Mercy of God in Time made very deep Impreſſion on my Mind; ſo that ſtill I find Reaſon to bleſs the Name of the Lord for having been pleaſed that I was the Son of ſuch an excellent Mother, who early in the Morning when ſhe felt Death approaching, called me up out of my Bed, and ſent me to her Brother, and to <hi>W. Caton,</hi> to come and ſee her, and I had hardly been returned a Quarter of an Hour before ſhe departed this Life, and ſlept in Peace, to my great Grief then; tho' afterwards, when I came to Years of diſcerning, I ſaw Reaſon to believe that it was not without a ſingular Providence that the Lord had taken her away: For one had long continued to be an importunate Suitor to her, who in Time loſt his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity.

Let therefore every one be faithful to the Lord, according to what he hath received; for truly ſome of you, I believe, have received five Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents. Let it but be duly conſidered and ſeen in the Light of the Lord, what Knowledge ye have had of the eternal God beyond many, even when ye were yet in Darkneſs: How often hath the Lord appeared, and clearly made manifeſt himſelf? And how abundantly hath he made it known in the Heart, that he it was who was worthy to be feared and ſerved? Certainly this is a great and weighty Talent, and therefore the Lord may ſay juſtly, What could I have done more to my Vineyard? O my Friends, beſides all this, he hath cauſed his eternal Light to ſhine into our Hearts, whereby we have ſeen the corrupted Ways of the World, and the Paths leading to Death. This, I ſay, the Lord hath ſhewed us by his eternal Light, Glory and Praiſes be given to our God for ever.</p>
                  <p>Dear Friends, go on in that which ye have begun; for I can bear Witneſs for the Lord, that his Love hath been abundantly ſhed abroad upon us, without Reſpect of Perſons, becauſe thoſe that fear him, and work Righteouſneſs, are acceptable to him: And he makes his Truth manifeſt among us, and cauſeth his Peace and Mercy to reſt upon us. It is true, that Satan doth not reſt to ſcatter this, and to ſow Doubts and Unbelief in our Hearts; but we keeping cloſe to the Lord, are preſerved from his Snares; and happy is he who hath found a Place where he is freed from Tempeſts: But before this Place be found, there are many hidden Rocks that may be ſtruck on, not unknown to

                  <p>May God Almighty preſerve you all by his Power, leſt any Strife or Diſcord be found among you; and may you grow up in Love, and thereby be obliged to bear each others Burdens; and let no tranſitory Things cumber your Hearts, but be reſigned to the Lord; for that to which we are called, is not to be compared to that which is tranſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or periſhing; ſince it is a Treaſure that is everlaſting, and to which the World, and all that is in it, is but as Dung, becauſe the moſt glorious Part of it is but Vanity of Vanities.

Now the God of all Mercies, who alone is immortal, keep you and us altogether unto the End, that ſo in theſe dangerous Times we may remain ſtanding, to the Glory of his great Name.

Neither did the Perſecutors leave off to diſturb the Meetings of thoſe called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> and impriſon many of them; nay ſo hardened and unrelenting were ſome, that when at <hi>London</hi> more than four Thouſand People died in one Week, they ſaid, That <hi>the only Means to ſtop the Peſtilence, was to ſend the</hi> Quakers <hi>out of the Land.</hi>
               <note place="margin">A daring and wicked Saying when more than 4000 dyed in a Week.</note> But theſe fainted not, but grew em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldened againſt Violence.

Thus the City became as a Deſert, and the Miſery was ſo great, that it was believed ſome died for Want of Attendance.</p>
            <p>It was about this Time that <hi>Samuel Fiſher,</hi>

It is reported that the King in the Time of this great Mortality once ask'd, <hi>Whether any</hi> Quakers <hi>died of the Plague?</hi> And having been told, <hi>Yes,</hi> he ſeemed to ſlight that Sickneſs,<note place="margin">Becauſe ſome <hi>Quakers</hi> died of the Plague, the King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded 'twas no Judgment on the <hi>Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors.</hi>
               </note> and to conclude, that then it could not be look'd upon as a Judgment or Plague upon their Preſecutors. But certainly his Chaplains might well have put him in Mind of what <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſaith, <hi>There is one Event to the Righteous and to the Wicked:</hi> And of this Saying of <hi>Job, HE deſtroyeth the Perfect and the Wicked:</hi> As alſo that of the Prophet, That <hi>the Righteous is taken away from the Evil to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now travelling in the Country was ſtopt, which made ſome People go with Boats along the Coaſt, and ſo went a-ſhore where they had a Mind. Thus did <hi>Stephen Criſp,</hi>

Great Fires were now kindled in the Streets to purify the contagious Air; but no Relief was found by it; for in the latter End of <hi>September,</hi> there died at <hi>London</hi> above eight Thouſand People in one Week, as I remember to have ſeen in one of the Bills of Mortality of that Time.</p>
            <p>In the mean while the Ship in which the baniſh'd Priſoners were,<note place="margin">The Ship with the condemn'd <hi>Quakers</hi> could not go off, the Maſter being impriſon'd for Deb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Iſaac Penington,</hi> being a Priſoner, writ about this Time to the King and Parliament, and publiſhed in Print, was alſo very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, being deſigned with Chriſtian Meekneſs, to diſſwade them, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, from going on with this miſchievous Work of Perſecution. In this Paper, containing ſome Queries, among many weighty Expreſſions, I find theſe alſo,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>After ye have done all ye can, even made Laws as ſtrong as ye can, and put them in the ſtricteſt Courſe of Execution ye can, one Night from the Lord may end the Controverſie, and ſhew whether we pleaſe the Lord in obeying him, or ye in making Laws againſt us for our Fidelity and Obedience to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And as the Lord is able to overturn you, ſo if ye miſtake your Work, miſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting the Paſſages of his Providence, and erring in Heart concerning the Ground of his former Diſpleaſure; and ſo (thro' the Error of Judgment) ſet your ſelves in Oppoſition againſt him replanting the Plants which he will not have grow, and plucking up the Plants of his planting; do ye not in this Caſe provoke the Lord, even to put forth the Strength which is in him againſt you? We are poor Worms. Alas, if ye had only us to deal with, we ſhould be nothing in your Hands! But if his Strength ſtand behind us, we ſhall prove a very bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome Stone, and ye will hardly be able to remove us out of the Place wherein God hath ſet us, and where he pleaſeth to have us diſpoſed of. And happy were it for you, if inſtead of perſecuting us, ye your ſelves were drawn to wait for the ſame Begettings of God (which we have felt) out of the Earthly Nature into his Life and Nature, and did learn of him to govern in that; then might ye be eſtabliſhed indeed, and be freed from the Danger of thoſe Shakings and Overturnings, which God haſtening upon the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now becauſe ye may be apt to think that I write theſe Things for my own Sake, and the Sakes of my Friends and Companions in the Truth of God, that we might eſcape the Sufferings and Severity which we are like to undergo from you; and not ſo mainly and chiefly for your Sakes, leſt you ſhould bring the Wrath of God and Miſery upon your Souls and Bodies: To prevent this Miſtake in you, I ſhall add what followeth. Indeed this is not the Intent of my Heart: For I have long expected, and do ſtill expect this Cup of outward Affliction and Perſecution from you, and my Heart is quieted and ſatisfied therein, knowing that the Lord will bring Glory to his Name, and Good to us out of it: But I am ſure it is not good for you to afflict us for that which the Lord requireth of us, and wherein he accepteth us; and ye will find it the bittereſt Work that ever ye went about, and in the End will wiſh that the Lord had rather never given you this Day of Proſperity, than that he ſhould ſuffer you thus to make <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of it. Now that ye may the more clearly ſee the Temper of my Spirit, and how my Heart ſtands in this Thing, I ſhall a little open unto you my Faith and Hope about it in theſe enſuing Particulars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="433" facs="unknown:003104_0444_0FEFF7250BC492C0"/>
               <hi>Firſt, I am aſſured in my Heart and Soul, that this deſpiſed People (called</hi> Quakers,) is of the Lord's begetting in his own Life and Nature. Indeed had I not ſeen the Power of God in them and received from the Lord an unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Teſtimony concerning them, I had never looked towards them: For they were otherwiſe very deſpiſable in my Eyes. And this I cannot but teſtifie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, that I have found the Life of God in me owning them, and that which God hath begotten in my Heart, refreſhed by the Power of Life in them: And none but the Lord knows the Beauty and Excellency of Glory, which he hath hid under this Appearance.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Lord hath hitherto preſerved them againſt great Oppoſitions, and is ſtill able to preſerve them. Every Power hitherto hath made nothing of over-running them; yet they have hitherto ſtood, by the Care and tender Mercy of the Lord; and the ſeveral Powers which have perſecuted them, have fallen one after another.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I have had Experience my ſelf of the Lord's Goodneſs and Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of me, in my ſuffering with them for the Teſtimony of his Truth, who made my Bonds pleaſant to me, and my noiſom Priſon (enough to have deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my weakly and tenderly-educated Nature) a Place of Pleaſure and Delight, where I was comforted by my God Night and Day, and filled with Prayers for his People, as alſo with Love to, and Prayers for thoſe who had been the Means of outwardly afflicting me and others upon the Lord's Account.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, I have no Doubt in my Heart that the Lord will deliver us. The Strength of Man, the Reſolution of Man is nothing in my Eye in Compare with the Lord. Whom the Lord loveth, he can ſave at his Pleaſure. Hath he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to break our Bonds and deliver us, and ſhall we now diſtruſt him? Are we in a worſe Condition than</hi> Iſrael <hi>was, when the Sea was before them, the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains on each Side, and the</hi> Aegyptians <hi>behind purſuing them? He indeed that looketh with Man's Eye, can ſee no Ground of Hope, nor hardly a Poſſibility of Deliverance; but (to the Eye of Faith) it is now nearer than when God began at firſt to deliver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, It is the Delight of the Lord, and his Glory to deliver his People, when to the Eye of Senſe it ſeemeth impoſſible. Then doth the Lord delight to ſtretch forth his Arm, when none elſe can help: And then doth it pleaſe him to deal with the Enemies of his Truth and People, when they are lifted up above the Fear of him, and are ready to ſay in their Hearts concerning them, They are now in our Hands, who can deliver them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Well, were it not in Love to you, and in Pity, (in relation to what will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly befall you, if ye go on in this Courſe) I could ſay in the Joy of my Heart, and in the Senſe of the Good-will of my God to us, who ſuffereth theſe Things to come to paſs,</hi> Go on, try it out with the Spirit of the Lord, come forth with your Laws, and Priſon, and ſpoiling of our Goods, and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and Death <hi>(if the Lord pleaſe)</hi> and ſee if ye can carry it: <hi>For we come not forth againſt you in our own Wills, or in any Enmity againſt your Perſons or Government, or in any Stubborneſs or Refractorineſs of Spirit; but with the Lamb-like Nature which the Lord our God hath begotten in us, which is taught and enabled by him, both to do his Will, and to ſuffer for his Name-ſake. And if we cannot thus overcome you (even in Patience of Spirit, and in Love to you) and if the Lord our God pleaſe not to appear for us, we are content to be overcome by you. So the Will of the Lord be done, ſaith my Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This the Author concludes with a Poſtſcript, containing a ſerious Exhortation to forſake Evil. Beſides this, he gave forth another Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, wherein he propoſed this Queſtion to the King and both Houſes of Parliament.</p>

Fox,</hi> whom in the foregoing Year we left in a hard Priſon at <hi>Lancaſter.</hi> In the Month called <hi>March,</hi> in this Year, he was brought again to his Trial before Judge <hi>Twiſden;</hi> and tho' Judge <hi>Turner</hi> had given Charge at the Aſſize before, to ſee no ſuch groſs Errors were in the Indictment as before, yet in that Reſpect this was not much better than the former, tho' the Judge examined it himſelf. The Jury then being called to be ſworn, and three Officers of the Court having depoſed, <hi>That the Oath had been tendred to him at the laſt Aſſizes, according to the Indictment,</hi> the Judge ſaid, <hi>It was not done in a Corner:</hi> And then asked him, <hi>What he had to ſay to it?</hi> And, <hi>Whether he had taken the Oath at the laſt Aſſizes? G. Fox</hi> thereupon gave an Account of what had been done then, and that he had ſaid, <hi>That the Book they gave him to ſwear on, ſaith, Swear not at all.</hi> And repeating more of what he ſpoke then, the Judge ſaid, <hi>I will not diſpute with you, but in Point of Law. G. Fox</hi> offering to ſpeak ſomething to the Jury concerning the Indictment, he was ſtopt by the Judge; and then <hi>G. Fox</hi> asked him, <hi>Whether the Oath was to be tendred to the King</hi>'s <hi>Subjects only, or to the Subjects of Foreign Princes?</hi> The Judge replied, <hi>To the Subjects of this Realm.</hi> Well, ſaid he, <hi>Look to the Indictment, and thou mayſt ſee that the Word</hi> Subject <hi>is left out of this Indictment alſo.</hi> Several other great Errors as to Time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he had obſerved in the Indictment, but no ſooner had he ſpoke concerning the Errors, but the Judge cried, <hi>Take him away, Jailor, take him away.</hi> Then he was hurried away; yet the Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>. After he was gone, the Judge asked the Jury, <hi>Whether they were agreed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> They ſaid, <hi>Yes,</hi> and found for the King againſt him. The Reaſon why <hi>G. Fox</hi> was led away ſo ſuddenly, ſeemed to be that they expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he would have proved the Officers of the Court to have ſworn falſly, ſeeing the Day on which the Oath had been tendred to him at the Aſſizes before, was wrong in the Indictment; and yet they had ſworn, that on that Day he had refuſed to take the Oath. Before <hi>G. Fox</hi> was brought before the Judge, he had paſſed Sentence of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munire</hi> againſt <hi>Margaret Fell,</hi> for having refuſed to take the Oath. And tho' this Sentence had not been paſſed againſt <hi>G Fox,</hi> yet he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded as a premunired Perſon; tho it had not been asked him, <hi>What he had to ſay why Sentence ſhould not be pronounced againſt him.</hi> And thus he continued Priſoner in <hi>Lancaſter</hi>-Caſtle.</p>
            <p>Whilſt he was there, tho' weak of Body, he writ ſeveral Papers. But the neighbouring Juſtices laboured much to get him removed from thence to ſome remote Place; for it was pretty well known among the People, how the Court at the Aſſizes had dealt with him. So about ſix Weeks after, they got an Order from the King and Council to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move him from <hi>Lancaſter;</hi> and they received alſo a Letter from the Earl of <hi>Angleſey,</hi> wherein it was written, <hi>That if theſe Things which he was charged with were found true againſt him, he deſerved no clemency or Mercy.</hi> And yet the greateſt Matter they had againſt him was his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal of the Oath. His Perſecutors now having prepared for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval,
<pb n="435" facs="unknown:003104_0446_0FEFF766E1440978"/>the Under-Sheriff, and the Head-Sheriff's Men, with ſome Bailiffs, came and fetch'd him out of the Caſtle, when he was ſo weak, by lying in that cold, wet and ſmoaky Priſon, that he could hardly go or ſtand. So they brought him down into the Jailor's Houſe, where Juſtice <hi>William Kirbey,</hi> and ſeveral others were.<note place="margin">Juſtice <hi>Kir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey,</hi> &amp;c. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive <hi>G.

G. Fox</hi> therefore deſired, That <hi>if they intended to remove him, they would firſt ſhew him their Order, or a Copy of it.</hi> But they would not ſhew him any, but their Swords. He then told them, <hi>There was no Sentence paſſed upon him, neither was he premunired, that he knew of; and therefore he was not made the King's Priſoner, but was the Sheriff's: For they and all the Country knew that he was not fully heard at the laſt Aſſizes, nor ſuffered to ſhew the Errors that were in the Indictment, which were ſufficient to quaſh it. And that they all knew there was no Sentence of Premunire paſſed upon him; and therefore he not being the King's Priſoner, but the Sheriff's, deſired to ſee their Order.</hi> But inſtead of ſhewing him their Order, they haled him out, and lifted him upon one of the Sheriff's Horſes; for he was ſo very weak, that he was hardly able to ſit on Horſeback. Riding thus along the Street, he was much gazed upon by the People, and had great Reaſon to ſay, that <hi>he received neither Chriſtianity, Civility, nor Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity;</hi> for how ill and weak ſoever he was, yet they hurried him away about fourteen Miles, to <hi>Bentham,</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire;</hi> and ſo wicked was the Jailor,<note place="margin">Abuſive Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of one <hi>Hunter,</hi> a Jailor, who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſoon after.</note> one <hi>Hunter,</hi> a young Fellow, that he laſht the Horſe on which <hi>G.

To which he anſwered, <hi>It was not civil in him to do ſo.</hi> Yet this malicious Fellow ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed little to regard it; but he had not long Time to delight in this kind of Inſolence; for ſoon after he was cut off by Death. <hi>G. Fox</hi> being come down to <hi>Bentham,</hi> was met by a Marſhal and ſeveral Troopers; and many of the Gentry, beſides Abundance of People, came thither to ſtare at him. Being entred the Houſe, and very much tired, he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red they would let him lie down on a Bed, which the Soldiers permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and the Marſhal, to whom he was delivered, ſet a Guard upon him. After having ſtaid there a while, they preſs'd Horſes, and ſending for the Bailiff and the Conſtables, they had him to <hi>Giggleſwick</hi> that Night. And there they raiſed the Conſtables,<note place="margin">

               </note> who ſat drinking all Night in the Room by him, ſo that he could get but little Reſt. The next Day coming to a Market-Town, ſeveral of his Friends came to ſee him; and at Night he asked the Soldiers, <hi>Whither they intended to carry him?</hi> To which ſome ſaid, <hi>Beyond Sea,</hi> and others, <hi>To</hi> Tinmouth <hi>Caſtle.</hi> And there was a Fear amongſt them, leſt ſome ſhould reſcue him; but there was not the leaſt Reaſon for it. The next Night he was brought to <hi>York,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Thence to <hi>York.</hi>
               </note> where the Marſhal put him into a great Chamber, where many of the Troopers came to him. He then ſpeaking ſomething by Way of Exhortation to the Soldiers, many of them were very loving to him. A while after, the Lord <hi>Frecheville,</hi> who commanded thoſe Horſe, came to him, and was civil and loving, and <hi>G. F.</hi> gave him an Account of his Impriſonment.</p>
            <p>After a Stay of two Days at <hi>York,</hi>
               <note place="margin">And thence to <hi>Scarborough</hi>-Caſtle, where he is ill uſed by the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Sir <hi>J.

On the Way they baited at <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and permitted his Friends to ſee him. Afterwards being come to <hi>Scarborough,</hi> they brought him to an Inn, and gave Notice of it to the Governour, who ſent ſix Soldiers to guard him that Night. The next Day they had him into the Caſtle, and there put him into a Room,
<pb n="436" facs="unknown:003104_0447_0FEFF7294AB001F8"/>
with a Centinel to watch him. Out of this Room they ſoon brought him into another, which was ſo open, that the Rain came in, and it ſmoaked exceedingly; which was very offenſive to him. One Day the Governor Sir <hi>John Croſland,</hi> came into the Caſtle with one Sir <hi>Francis Cob. G. F.</hi> deſired the Governor to come into his Room, and ſee how it was; and ſo they did: And <hi>G. F.</hi> having got a little Fire made in the Room, it was ſo filled with Smoke, that they could hardly find the Way out again. And he being a Papiſt, <hi>G. F.</hi> told him, <hi>That was his Purgatory which they had put him into.</hi> For it plainly appeared that there was an Intent to vex and diſtreſs him: For after he had been at the Charge of laying out about fifty Shillings, to keep out the Rain, and ſomewhat to eaſe the Smoke, they put him into a worſe Room, which had neither Chimney nor Fire-hearth; and lying much open toward the Sea-ſide, the Wind ſo drove in the Rain, that the Water not only ran about the Room, but alſo came upon upon his Bed. And he having no Fire to dry his Clothes when they were wet, his Body was ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummed with Cold, and his Fingers ſwelled to that Degree, that one grew as big as two. And ſo malicious were his Perſecutors, that they would hardly ſuffer any of his Friends to come at him, nay not ſo much as to bring him a little Food; ſo that he was forced to hire ſomebody to bring him Neceſſaries. Thus he ſpent about a Quarter of a Year; and afterwards being put into a Room where a Fire could be made, be hir'd a Soldier to fetch him what he wanted. He then eat almoſt nothing but Bread, and of this ſo little, that a Three-penny Loaf commonly ſerved him three Weeks; and moſt of his Drink was Water, that had Wormwood ſteeped in it; and once when the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was very ſharp, and he had taken great Cold, he got ſome Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campane Beer.</p>
            <p>Now tho' he deſired his Friends and Acquaintance might be ſuffered to come to him,<note place="margin">His Friends deſiring it, not permitted to come to him, while many Papiſts and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, with whom he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes freely.</note> yet this was refuſed; but ſome others were admitted to come and gaze vpon him, eſpecially Papiſts, of whom a great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany once being come, they affirmed, <hi>That the Pope was infallible, and had been ſo ever ſince St.</hi> Peter's <hi>Time.</hi> But <hi>G. F.</hi> denied this, and alledged from Hiſtory, <q>That <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> one of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> denied the Faith, and ſacrificed to Idols; and therefore was not infallible. And he ſaid alſo, If the Papiſts were in the infallible Spirit, they ſhould not maintain their Religion by Jails, Swords, Gallows, Fires, Racks and Tortures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor want ſuch Means to hold it up by: For if they were in the infallible Spirit, they would preſerve Mens Lives, and uſe none but ſpiritual Weapons about Religion.</q> He alſo told them, how a certain Woman, that had been a Papiſt, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards entred into the Society of thoſe called <hi>Quakers,</hi> having a Tailor at work at her Houſe, and ſpeaking to him concerning the Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Popiſh Religion, was threatned to have been ſtabb'd by him, for which End he drew his Knife at her: Since it was as the Woman ſaid, <hi>the Principle of the Papiſts, if any turn from their Religion, to kill them if they can.</hi> This Story he told the Papiſts, and they did not deny this to be their Principle, but ask'd, <hi>If he would declare this abroad?</hi> And he ſaid, <hi>Yes, ſuch Things ought to be declared abroad, that it may be known how contrary your Religion is to true Chriſtianity.</hi> Whereupon they went away in a great Rage. Some Time after, another Papiſt came to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with him, and ſaid, That <hi>all the Patriarchs were in Hell, from the Creation till Chriſt came; and that when he ſuffered, he went into Hell, and the Devil ſaid to him, What comeſt thou hither for; to break open our ſtrong Holds? And Chriſt ſaid, To fetch them all out. And ſo,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>Chriſt was three Days and three Nights in Hell, to bring them all out.</hi> On Which <hi>G. F.</hi> ſaid to him, <hi>That was falſe; for Chriſt ſaid to the Thief, This

Day thou ſhalt be with me in Paradice.</hi> He alſo ſaid, <hi>That</hi> Enoch <hi>and</hi> Elijah <hi>were tranſlated into Heaven; and that</hi> Abraham <hi>alſo was in Heaven, ſince the Scripture ſaith, that</hi> Lazarus <hi>was in his Boſom. And</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Elias <hi>were with Chriſt upon the Mount, before he ſuffered.</hi> With theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances he ſtopt his Adverſary's Mouth, and put him to a Nonplus.</p>
            <p>Another Time there came to him a great Phyſician called Dr. <hi>Witty,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Witty,</hi> a Presbyterian, accompanied with the Lord <hi>Falconbridge</hi> and other great Men, diſcourſes with him.</note> being accompanied with the Lord <hi>Falconbridge,</hi> the Governor of <hi>Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> Caſtle, and ſeveral Knights; and <hi>G.

F.</hi> told him, <hi>Becauſe he would not diſobey the Command of Chriſt, and ſwear.</hi> To which the Doctor ſaid, <hi>He ought to ſwear his Allegiance to the King.</hi> Now <hi>G. F.</hi> knowing him to be a great <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> asked him, <hi>Whether he had not ſworn againſt the King and the Houſe of Lords, and taken the</hi> Scotch <hi>Covenant? And whether he had not ſince ſworn to the King?</hi> The Doctor having no ready Anſwer to this, <hi>G. F.</hi> asked him, <hi>What then was his Swearing good for?</hi> telling him farther, <hi>My Allegiance doth not conſiſt in Swearing, but in Truth and Faithfulneſs.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome further Diſcourſe, <hi>G. F.</hi> was led away to his Priſon again; and afterwards the Doctor boaſted, <hi>That he had conquered</hi> George Fox, which he having heard, told the Governor, <hi>It was a ſmall Boaſt in him to ſay he had conquered a Bondman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A while after, this Doctor came again, having many great Perſons with him, and he affirmed before them all, That <hi>Chriſt had not enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned every Man that cometh into the World; that the Grace of God, which brought Salvation, had not appeared unto all Men; and that Chriſt had not died for all Men. G. F.</hi> asked him, <hi>What Sort of Men thoſe were, which Chriſt had not enlightned?</hi> and <hi>whom his Grace had not appeared to?</hi> To which the Doctor anſwered, <hi>Chriſt did not die for Adulterers, and Idolaters, and wicked Men.</hi> Then <hi>G. F.</hi> asked him, <hi>Whether Adulterers and wicked Men were not Sinners?</hi> And he ſaid, <hi>Yes.</hi> Which made <hi>G. F.</hi> ſay, <hi>And did not Chriſt die for Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners? Did he not come to call Sinners to Repentance? Yes,</hi> ſaid the Doctor. <hi>Then,</hi> reply'd <hi>G. F.

                  </gap>ſt ſtopt thy own Mouth.</hi> And ſo he proved, <q>That the Grace of God had appeared to all Men, tho' ſome turned it into Wantonneſs, and walked deſpitefully againſt it; and that Chriſt had enlightned all Men, tho' ſome hated the Light.</q> Several of thoſe that were preſent confeſſed, it was true; but the Doctor went away in a Rage, and came no more to him.</p>
            <p>Another Time the Governor came to him,<note place="margin">The Governor, with ſome Parliament-Men, come to talk with him.</note> with two or three Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Men, and they asked him, <hi>Whether he owned Miniſters and Biſhops?</hi> To which he ſaid, <hi>Yes, ſuch as Chriſt ſent forth, ſuch as had freely received, and would freely give and ſuch as were qualified, and were in the ſame Power and Spirit, that they were in, in the Apoſtles Days. But ſuch Biſhops and Teachers as yours are, that will go no farther than they have a great Benefice, I do not own; for they are not like the Apoſtles: For Chriſt ſaith to his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> Go ye into all Nations, and preach the Goſpel. <hi>But ye Parliament-Men, that keep your Prieſts and Biſhops in ſuch great fat Benefices, ye have ſpioled them all: For do ye think they will go into all Nations to preach, or will go any further than they have great fat Benefices? Judge your ſelves, whether they will or no.</hi> To this they could ſay little; and whatever was objected to <hi>G. Fox,</hi> he always had an Anſwer in Readineſs; and becauſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it was ſimple and plain, his Enemies from thence took Occaſion to ſay, that he was a Fool. But whatever ſuch ſaid, it is certain, that he had a good Underſtanding, tho' he was not educated in humane Learning. This I know by my own Experience, for I have had fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Converſation with him.</p>
            <p>In this his Priſon he was much viſited even by People of Note. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Fairfax</hi>'s Widow came once to him with a great Company, one

of which was a Prieſt, who began to quarrel with him, becauſe ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to one Perſon he ſaid, <hi>Thou and Thee,</hi> and not <hi>You;</hi> and thoſe that ſpoke ſo, the Prieſt ſaid <hi>He counted but Fools.</hi> Which made <hi>G. F.</hi> ask him, <hi>Whether they that tranſlated the Scriptures, and that made the</hi> Grammar <hi>and</hi> Accidence, <hi>were Fools? Seeing they tranſlated the Scriptures ſo, and made the</hi> Grammar <hi>ſo,</hi> Thou <hi>to one, and</hi> You <hi>to more than one?</hi> With theſe and other Reaſons he ſoon ſilenced the Prieſt; and ſeveral of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany acknowledged the Truth he declared to them, and were loving to him; and ſome of them would have given him Money; but he would not receive it.</p>
            <p>Whilſt I leave him yet Priſoner,<note place="margin">An Account of <hi>W. Dundas,</hi> his Convince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> I'll go to other Matters, and relate the remarkable Caſe of one <hi>William Dundas,</hi> who being a Man of ſome Repute in <hi>Scotland,</hi> came over to the Communion of thoſe called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> in a ſingular Manner. He was a Man of a ſtrict Life, and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the eccleſiaſtical Inſtitutions there as diligently as any of the moſt preciſe: But in Time he ſaw, that bodily Exerciſe profited little, and that it was true Godlineſs which the Lord required from Man. In this State becoming more circumſpect than he was accuſtomed to be, he did not frequent the publick Aſſemblies ſo much as formerly. But this was ſoon taken Notice of; and being asked the Reaſon why, he ſaid, <hi>That there was a Thing beyond that, which he looked for.</hi> But it was told him, <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> was a dangerous Principle.</hi> To which <hi>Dundas</hi> replied, <hi>That he was not to receive the Law from the Mouth of Man.</hi> Then the Miniſter (ſo called) ſaid to him, <hi>That he tempted God.</hi> To which <hi>Dundas</hi> returned, <hi>That God could not be tempted to Evil.</hi> Now that which made him more averſe to the Prieſts of that Nation, was to ſee their domineering Pride, and how they forced ſome that were not one with them in their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, to comply with their Inſtitutions, ſprinkling the Children of Parents even without their Conſent. Add to this, their going from one Benefice to another, being always ready to go over from a ſmall Church to a great one, under Pretence of more Service for the Church; whereas it plainly appeared that ſelfiſh Intereſt generally was the main Cauſe. This Behaviour of the Clergy, and their rigid Perſecution, if any deviated a little from the Church-Ceremonies, and the common Form,<note place="margin">The hard Caſe of one <hi>Wood,</hi> a Cuſtom-houſe Officer.</note> turned <hi>Dundas</hi>'s Affection from them. An Inſtance of this Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidneſs, was, that one— <hi>Wood,</hi> who had ſome Charge in the Cuſtom-houſe of <hi>Leith,</hi> and approved in ſome Reſpect the Doctrine of thoſe called <hi>Quakers,</hi> had ſaid, <hi>That Chriſt was the Word, and that the Letter was not the Word.</hi> For this he was cited before the eccleſiaſtical Aſſembly of <hi>Lothian,</hi> where <hi>Dundas</hi> was preſent; and <hi>Wood</hi> ſo well defended his Saying, that none were able to overthrow his Arguments, chiefly drawn from theſe Words of <hi>John, That the Word was made Fleſh, and dwelt among us. Wood</hi> continuing to maintain his Aſſertion, they began to threaten him with Excommunication, and would not allow him ſo much Time as to give his Anſwer to the next Aſſembly. Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication there was ſuch a Penalty, that People under it were very much deprived of Converſation with Men. The Fear of this made <hi>Wood</hi> comply in a little Time; and meeting <hi>Dundas</hi> about three Months after, in the Street at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> he told him, <hi>That he had been forced to bow to the Aſſembly againſt his Light; for if he had been excommunicated, he had loſt his Livelyhood.</hi> Thus <hi>Wood</hi> bowed thro' humane Fear, but he hardly out-lived this two Years.<note place="margin">The Prieſts jealous of <hi>Dundas,</hi> open his Letters at the Poſt-houſe, and find he correſponds with <hi>G.

kept them: But if they found nothing in them, by which they could prejudice him, they cauſed them to be ſealed up again, and delivered to him. By this baſe Practice they came to know that one <hi>Gawen Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> Merchant of <hi>London,</hi> ſent him a Box, with about three Pounds Sterling worth of Books.<note place="margin">Prieſt <hi>Oſwald</hi> ſeizes his Books.</note> This <hi>Box, Dundas</hi> found afterwards, that the Prieſt <hi>John Oſwald</hi> had taken away: And whatever he did, he could not get them again, till the <hi>Engliſh</hi> came into <hi>Scotland,</hi> but then many of them were wanting.<note place="margin">At length he is excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated.</note> 
               <hi>Dundas</hi> in the mean while unwilling to comply with the Kirk, was at length excommunicated: But he was generally ſo well eſteemed, that none ſeemed to regard that Sentence ſo as to keep at a Diſtance from him; which made this Act the more contemptible. Now tho' <hi>Dundas</hi> favoured the Doctrine of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> yet they were ſuch a deſpiſed People, that he, who was a Man of ſome Account in the World, could not as yet give up to join with them.</p>
            <p>It happened once that he was riding from <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to his Houſe,<note place="margin">Defends a <hi>Quaker</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted on the Road.</note> in a Winter-Evening, and hearing a Noiſe of ſome Men as if Fighting, he bad his Man ride up in Haſte to ſee what it was; which he did, and calling out, ſaid, that there were two Men on Horſe-back beating of another on Foot. <hi>Dundas</hi> riding up to them, ſaw the two beating the other Man, who ſaid to them, <hi>What did I ſay to you, but bid you fear God?</hi> By this <hi>Dundas</hi> preſently perceived that the Man thus beaten was a <hi>Quaker;</hi> and asking his Name, which the other telling, he knew it, tho' he did not know the Man by Sight; and then he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ell a beating the two with his Rod, and ordered thoſe that were with him, to carry them to the next Priſon: But the ſaid <hi>Quaker</hi> intreated him to let them go; which he did after having ask'd their Names and Dwelling-Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. About a Week after, the ſaid <hi>Quaker</hi> told a Relation of <hi>Dundas</hi> what Kindneſs he ſhewed him, and how he had in ſome Manner been ſaved by him; <hi>Yet,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I found the ſame Spirit in him that was in the other two Men who beat me.</hi> Such a Saying as this would have offended ſome Men, but with <hi>Dundas</hi> it had a contrary Effect; for theſe Words ſo reached him, that ſome Time after meeting the ſaid <hi>Quaker</hi> again, he deſired, <hi>That as he paſſed that Way, he would make his Houſe his lodging Place.</hi> Which kind Invitation he ſeemed not unwilling to accept o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. <hi>Dundas</hi> had now attained to ſo much Experience, that he could diſcern between the Spirits of Meekneſs and Raſhneſs, and ſufficiently perceive that the ſaid <hi>Quaker</hi> by that which he ſpoke concerning him had not made himſelf guilty of the Latter: But yet he could not bow ſo low, as to join in Society with the <hi>Quakers,</hi> tho' ſecretly he endeavoured more and more to live up to their Doctrine; and therein he enjoyed more Peace in his Heart than formerly.</p>
            <p>But his outward Condition in the World not being very forward,<note place="margin">Goes into <hi>France,</hi> and ſettles at <hi>Diep.</hi>
               </note> he went into <hi>France,</hi> and ſettled at <hi>Diep.</hi> Whilſt he dwelt there, a certain Woman out of <hi>England</hi> came thither with her Maid, and ſpread in the Town ſome Books of <hi>George Fox</hi> and <hi>William Dewsbury</hi> tranſlated into <hi>French;</hi> and ſhe her ſelf having written ſome Papers, got them turn'd into <hi>French</hi> by <hi>Dundas,</hi> and ſo diſtributed them. But the Meſſage ſhe chiefly came for, ſhe hid from him, and that not without Reaſon; for what ſhe acted there, was ſo ſingular, that if it had been known be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it is probable ſhe would not have been able to perform it. Tho' I do not find what her Intent was in the Thing, yet it ſeems likely to me, that ſhe not knowing the Language there ſpoken, would by a Sign teſtify againſt their Pride in Apparel and Dreſs,<note place="margin">Strange Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Woman at the Proteſtants Place of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip there.</note> and that on this wiſe: On the firſt Day of the Week ſhe came to the Meeting-houſe of the Proteſtants there, where ſome Thouſands of People were met, and having ſet her ſelf in the moſt conſpicuous Place, juſt over againſt him that preached, before the Service was finiſhed, ſhe ſtood up with
<pb n="440" facs="unknown:003104_0451_0FEFF7AE5BBE3028"/>
the Maid that was with her, who taking off a Mantle and Hood ſhe was covered with, ſhe appeared clothed in Sack-cloth, and her Hair hanging down ſprinkled with Aſhes. Thus ſhe turned her ſelf round ſeveral Times, that all the People might ſee her. This Sight ſtruck both Preacher and Auditory with no ſmall Conſternation; and the Preacher's Wife afterwards telling ſomebody how this Sight had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected her, ſaid, <hi>This is of deeper Reach than I can comprehend.</hi> The ſaid Women having ſtood thus a while, fell both down upon their Knees and pray'd, and then went out of the Meeting, many following them, and diſtributed ſome Books. Then they came to their Lodging, which was in a <hi>Scotchman</hi>'s Houſe; but he refuſing them Entrance, they came to <hi>Dundas</hi>'s Lodging, who knew nothing of all this. They therefore told him, that the Work they came for in that Nation was now done; and he asking what they had done, they told him; and ſignified that they wanted Lodging till they went away. Then he went abroad to ſee if he could find Lodging for them; but in vain; he then offered them his Bed, being willing to ſhift for himſelf ſome where elſe, but they refuſed to accept of his Offer; and his Landlady not being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to let them ſit up that Night in any of her Rooms, they were fain to ſtay that Night in an Out-Houſe.</p>
            <p>Now this Buſineſs had made ſuch a Stir in Town, that one of the King's Officers coming the next Day to <hi>Dundas,</hi> told him, <hi>That he had tranſgreſſed the Laws of the Nation, by receiving Perſons of another Religion to his Lodging; for the King tolerated only two Religions,</hi> viz. Papiſts <hi>and</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants. To this <hi>Dundas</hi> ſaid, <hi>That he had not tranſgreſſed the Law of Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality, and he had been forced to do ſo, ſince he could not let them lie in the Street, where they would have been in Danger of their Lives by the rude Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</hi> Then the Women were taken away, and ſent to Priſon; and they not being provided with Food, <hi>Dundas</hi> took Care of that. Some Time after, an Order being come from the Parliament at <hi>Roan,</hi> it was read to them, viz. <hi>That they ſhould be tranſported forthwith back to</hi> England, <hi>with the firſt Paſſage-boat, and all their Papers and Books to be burnt in the Market, and themſelves alſo, if ever they ſhould come to that Nation again.</hi> In Purſuance of this, they were put into a Paſſage-boat in the Night-time, and ſo ſent to <hi>England.</hi> Afterwards the People at <hi>Diep</hi> intended to purſue <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> as one of their Judgment; but he was unwilling to be looked upon as ſuch, tho' the Proteſtants had inform'd againſt him, <hi>That he did not come to their Meeting:</hi> But of this no Crime could be made; and <hi>Dundas</hi> told them, <hi>If they perſecuted him, being a Merchant, and trafficking there, they might expect the like to be done to their Merchants in</hi> England. And when the Judge affirmed, <hi>that</hi> Dundas <hi>was of the Judgment of thoſe Women,</hi> he told him, <hi>That they were better than he; but that their Way was too ſtrait for him to walk in.</hi> There fell out two Things which <hi>Dundas</hi> took ſingular Notice of; the one was, that the <hi>Scotchman</hi> who ſhut out the Women, died within twelve Months after; and the other, that the Houſe of his Landlady, who refuſed them a Chamber to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In the mean while <hi>Dundas</hi> continued in an unquiet Condition; for by Reaſon of Human Fear, he found himſelf too weak to profeſs publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before Men what he believed to be Truth.</p>
            <p>Then he went to <hi>Roan,</hi>

                  <hi>Dundas</hi> comes to <hi>Roan,</hi> and thence ſpreads many Books written by Friends.</note> but could get no Reſt there, being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what indiſpos'd in Body, and having from <hi>England</hi> gotten a great many Books treating of the Doctrine of thoſe called <hi>Quakers,</hi> he ſent ſome of them to the Judge Criminal at <hi>Diep,</hi> and ſome to the Jeſuits College there, and at <hi>Paris.</hi> Afterwards he ſpread ſome Books alſo at <hi>Caen,</hi> where many Proteſtants lived.

By this he was forced to leave that Place, and went to <hi>Alencon,</hi> where ſtaying a while, the Judge Criminal ſent for him; and after a long Diſcourſe, he and <hi>Dundas</hi> agreed ſo well, that he invited him to come and ſee him oftner, and that if he would, he might have an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to diſcourſe with ſome of the Jeſuits. But <hi>Dundas</hi> told him, <hi>That he was not willing to diſpute with any; yet he ſhould not be afraid to maintain his Principles againſt all the Jeſuits of the Nation.</hi> This being told the Jeſuits, it ſo exaſperated them againſt him, that being once out of Town, they cauſed his Chamber-Door to be broken up, to ſearch his Lodging. He complaining of this to the Judge Criminal, the Judge told him, <hi>He knew nothing of it, and if there was any Thing, it did proceed from the Jeſuits, becauſe of his Confidence againſt them.</hi> This ſeem'd not improbable, for he found his Letters opened at the Poſt-houſe ſeveral Times, and when he challenged the Poſt-maſter, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived for an Anſwer, That <hi>they came ſo to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some Time after he returned to <hi>Caen,</hi>

            <p>In the next Year, when a War aroſe between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> he came again to <hi>Diep,</hi> in Order to return to <hi>England,</hi> having got Paſſage in Company of the Lord <hi>Hollis</hi> Ambaſſador from <hi>England,</hi> where being arrived, he frequented the Meetings of thoſe called <hi>Quakers,</hi> yet he was not bold enough to own the Name of <hi>Quaker,</hi> but continu'd in the common Way of Salutations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet at length the Truth they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd had ſuch Power over him, that not being able to enjoy Peace without yielding Obedience to the inward Convictions upon his Mind, he at length gave up, and ſo entred into their Society, and obtain'd true Peace with the Lord, which he had long reaſon'd himſelf out of. In Proceſs of Time he publiſh'd a Book in Print, from which I have drawn this Relation, which he concluded with a Poem, in which he thank'd God for his ſingular Dealings and Mercies beſtowed upon him, wiſhing that others might reap Benefit by it.</p>

This gave Occaſion to <hi>Caton</hi> to complain of it to a Burgo-maſter of the City, I think the Lord <hi>Cornelius Van Vlooſwyh,</hi> who at that Time was one of the Lords of the Admiralty; he bid <hi>Caton</hi> come to his Houſe at ſuch a Time as he was to go to the Court; which he did, and went with the ſaid Burgoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter towards the Court; where being come, and Entrance denied him by the ſaid Officer, the Burgomaſter charged him, not to hinder <hi>Caton</hi> from viſiting the Priſoners.</p>

F. ye have given that Title to an old Houſe, which belongs to the People, and ye have taught People to believe ſo.</hi> He ask'd him alſo, <hi>Why he perſecuted his Friends for not paying Tythes? And whether God did ever give a Command to the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>that they ſhould pay Tythes? And whether Chriſt had not ended Tythes, when he ended the</hi> Levitical-<hi>Prieſthood that took Tythes? And whether Chriſt, when he ſent forth his Diſciples to preach, had not commanded them to</hi> preach freely, as he had given them freely? <hi>And whether all the Miniſters of Chriſt were not bound to obſerve this Command of Chriſt? Cradock</hi> ſaid, <hi>He would not diſpute that:</hi> And being unwilling to ſtay on this Subject, he turned to another Matter; but finding <hi>G. F.</hi> never to be at a Loſs for Anſwer, and that he could get no Advantage on him, he at length went away with his Company. With ſuch kind of People <hi>G. F.</hi> was often troubled while he was Priſoner there; for moſt that came to the Caſtle would ſpeak with him, and many Diſputes he had with them. But as to his Friends, he was as a Man buried alive, for very few of them were ſuffered to come to him. <hi>Joſiah Cole</hi> once deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Admittance, the Governor told him, <hi>You are an underſtanding Man, but</hi> G. Fox <hi>is a meer Fool.</hi> Now tho' the Governour dealt hardly with him, yet in Time he alter'd, for having ſent out a Privateer to Sea, they took ſome Ships that were not their Enemies, which brought him into ſome Trouble; after that, he grew ſomewhat more friendly to <hi>G. F.</hi> to whom the Deputy Governor ſaid once, <hi>That the King know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he had a great Intereſt in the People, had ſent him thither, that if there ſhould be any ſtirring in the Nation, they ſhould hang him over the Wall.</hi> And among the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who were numerous in thoſe Parts, there was much Talk then of hanging <hi>G. F.</hi> But he told them, <hi>If that was it they deſired, and it was permitted them, he was ready, for he never feared Death nor Sufferings in his Life; but was known to be an innocent peaceable Man, free from all Stirrings and Plottings, and one that ſought the Good of all Men.</hi> But the Governor now growing kinder, <hi>G. F.</hi> ſpoke to him when he was to go to the Parliament at <hi>London,</hi> and deſired him to ſpeak with <abbr>Eſq</abbr> 
               <hi>Marſh,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Cob,</hi> and ſome others, and to tell them, how long he had lain in Priſon, and for what. This the Governour did, and at his coming back told him,<note place="margin">

               <hi>G.

            </p>
            <p>The very next Day after <hi>G. F.</hi> was releaſed,<note place="margin">The Fire breaks out at <hi>London.</hi>
               </note> the Fire broke out at <hi>London,</hi> and the Report of it came quickly down into the Country, how that City was turned into Rubbiſh and Aſhes, (inſomuch that after an inceſſant Fire which laſted near four Days, but little of old <hi>London,</hi> was left ſtanding) there being about thirteen thouſand and two hundred Houſes burnt; the Account whereof hath been ſo cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantially deſcribed by others, that I need not treat of it at large; but I can't omit to ſay, that <hi>Thomas Briggs,</hi> ſome Years before paſſing thro' the Streets of <hi>London,</hi> preacht Repentance to the Inhabitants; and coming thro' <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> he cry'd out, That <hi>unleſs</hi> London <hi>repented, as</hi> Nineveh <hi>did, God would deſtroy it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I may relate another remarkable Prediction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thomas Ibbit</hi> of <hi>Huntingtonſhire</hi> came to <hi>London</hi> a few Days before the burning of that City,<note place="margin">Its Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion foretold by <hi>T Briggs.</hi>
               </note> and (as hath been related by Eye-Witneſſes) did upon his coming thither, alight from his Horſe, and unbutton his Cloaths in ſo looſe a Manner, as if they had been put on in haſte juſt out of Bed.</p>
            <p>In this Manner he went about the City on the 6th (being the Day he came thither) and alſo on the 7th Day of the Week, pronouncing a Judgment by Fire which ſhould lay Waſte the City. On the Evening of theſe Days ſome of his Friends had Meetings with him, to enquire concerning his Meſſage and Call to pronounce that impending Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: In his Account whereof he was not more particular and clear, than that he ſaid he for ſome Time had the Viſion thereof, but had delayed to come and declare it as commanded, until he felt (as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd it) the Fire in his own Boſom: Which Meſſage or Viſion was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſuddenly proved to be ſadly true, as the foregoing brief Account doth in Part declare. The Fire began on the 2d of <hi>September,</hi> 1666, on the firſt Day of the Week, which did immediately follow thoſe two Days the ſaid <hi>Thomas Ibbit</hi> had gone about the City declaring that Judgment.</p>
            <p>Having gone up and down the City, as hath been ſaid, when after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he ſaw the Fire break out, and beheld the fulfilling of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
<pb n="446" facs="unknown:003104_0457_0FEFF7B996F4FFB8"/>a ſpiritual Pride ſeized on him, which, if others had not been wiſer than he, might have tended to his utter Deſtruction: For the Fire being come as far as the Eaſt-end of <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> he plac'd himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Flame, and ſpread his Arms forth, as if to ſtay the Progreſs of it; and if one <hi>Thomas Matthews,</hi> with others had not pull'd him (who ſeem'd now altogether diſtracted) from thence, it was like he might have periſh'd by the Fire. Yet in Proceſs of Time, as I have been told, he came to ſome Recovery, and confeſs'd this Error; an evident Proof of human Weakneſs, and a notorious Inſtance of our Frailty, when we aſſume to our ſelves the doing of any Thing, to which Heaven alone can enable us. I can't well paſs by without taking Notice of it, that about three Weeks before the ſaid Fire, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> landed in the Iſland <hi>Schelling</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> under the Conduct of Captain <hi>Holmes,</hi> and ſetting the Town on Fire, there were above three hundred Houſes burnt down, belonging moſtly to <hi>Baptiſts</hi> that did not bear Arms. It may be farther obſerved, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were beaten at Sea this Summer by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> under the Conduct of Admiral <hi>De Ruiter,</hi> in a Fight which laſted four Days; ſo that they had Occaſion to call to Mind how often the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God had been foretold them, which now came over their Country, <hi>viz.</hi> Peſtilence, War and Fire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>G. Fox</hi> being at Liberty, did not omit to viſit his Friends, and in their Meetings to edify them with his Exhortations, whereby others alſo ſometimes came to be convinc'd.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>G. F.</hi> comes to <hi>Whitby,</hi> &amp; viſits a Prieſt who had threatned his Life.</note> And coming to <hi>Whitby,</hi> he went to a Prieſt's Houſe, who fourteen Years before had ſaid, <hi>That if ever he met</hi> G. Fox <hi>again, he would have his Life, or he ſhould have his.</hi> But now his Wife was not only become one of <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s Friends, but this Prieſt himſelf favoured the Doctrine profeſſed by his Wife, and was very kind to <hi>G. F.</hi> who paſs'd from thence to <hi>York,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Then goes to <hi>York,</hi> and pays a Viſit to Juſtice <hi>Robinſon.</hi>

            <p>In this County <hi>G.

                  <p>And as concerning thoſe ſucceeding Times, the Spirit of the Lord hath ſignified, that they will be Times of Horrour and Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to all that have, and yet do reject his Counſel: For as the Days of his Forbearance, Warning and Inviting, have been long, ſo ſhall his Appearance amongſt thoſe that have withſtood him, be fierce and terrible; even ſo terrible, as who ſhall abide his Coming?

            <p>In the Year 1667,<note place="margin">1667</note> a Book came forth in Print at <hi>London,</hi> with this Title,<note place="margin">A ſhort Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the arbitrary and violent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of Juſtice <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morer</hi> at <hi>Reading,</hi> &amp;c. In particular againſt <hi>Tho. Curtis</hi> and Family.</note> 
               <hi>Perſecution appearing with its open Face in</hi> William Armorer. This was written by ſome of the Priſoners called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and contained a Relation of the impetuous Carriage of the ſaid <hi>Armorer,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Knight and Juſtice of Peace, had made it his Buſineſs many Years one after another, to perſecute the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and from Time to Time to diſturb their Religious Meetings. From a Multitude of Caſes I meet with in the ſaid Book, I'II pick out but a few. The aforeſaid <hi>Armorer</hi> came very often to the Houſe of <hi>Thomas Curtis,</hi> at <hi>Reading,</hi> to diſturb the Meeting, taking many Perſons Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners from thence, particularly once thirty four, both Men and Women, at a time. And when they were brought to their Trial, the Oath was tendered them as the moſt ready Means to enſnare and to keep them in Priſon. Among the Priſoners taken out of the Meeting was one <hi>Henry Pizing,</hi>

Curtis</hi> (whole Wire <hi>Anne</hi> was a Daughter of a Sheriff of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> that had been hang'd near his own Door, for endeavouring to bring in the King) was releaſed after ſome ſmall Time; but quickly taken Priſoner again by <hi>Armorer,</hi> who perceiving that he intended to have gone to <hi>Briſtol</hi>-Fair, cauſed him to be brought to an Inn, where he told him, <hi>You are going to</hi> Briſtol-<hi>Fair, but I will ſtop your Journey.</hi> And then commanding the Conſtable to carry him to Priſon, he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled thither without a <hi>Mittimus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About this Time <hi>Curtis</hi>'s impriſon'd Friends writ a Paper, and it is like he had a Hand in it, to ſhew tho Hurt and Miſchief proceeding from Swearing.

               <note place="margin">2 Kings viii. 13.</note> 
               <hi>What! Is thy Servant a Dog, that he ſhould do this great Thing? J. Crook</hi> thus opening Matters to her, did by his wholſome Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition ſo work upon her Mind, that ſhe who never had convers'd with the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and was altogether ignorant of their Doctrine, now came to apprehend that it was the Grace of God that brings Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which ſhe ſo often had withſtood; and that this Grace had not yet quite forſaken her, but now made her ſenſible of the Greatneſs of her Tranſgreſſion. This Conſideration wrought ſo powerfully, that from a moſt grievous Sinner now ſhe became a true Penitent, and with hearty Sorrow ſhe cry'd to the Lord, that it might pleaſe him not to hide his Countenance. And continuing in this State of Humiliation, and ſincere Repentance, and perſevering in Supplication, ſhe felt in Time ſome Eaſe; and giving heed to the Exhortations of <hi>J. Crook,</hi> ſhe attained at length to a ſure Hope of Forgiveneſs by the precious Blood of the immaculate Lamb, who died for the Sins of the World. Of this ſhe gave manifeſt Proofs at her Trial before judge <hi>Matthew Hale,</hi> who having heard how penitent ſhe was, would fain have ſpared her, having on purpoſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be inſerted in the Indictment, that ſhe had committed the Fact
<pb n="460" facs="unknown:003104_0471_0FEFF7C9FAA6CD10"/>
wilfully and deſignedly. But ſhe being asked according to the Form, <hi>Guilty,</hi> or <hi>Not Guilty?</hi> readily anſwered, <hi>Guilty.</hi> This aſtoniſhed the Judge, who purpoſely had got the Words <hi>wilfully and deſignedly</hi> inſerted in the Indictment, that from hence ſhe might find Occaſion to deny the Charge, and ſo to quaſh the Indictment; and therefore he told her, <hi>That ſhe ſeemed not duly to conſider what ſhe ſaid; ſince it could not well be believed that ſuch a one as ſhe, who it may be inconſiderately had roughly handled her Child, ſhould have kill'd it wilfully and deſignedly.</hi> Here the Judge opened a Back-door for her to avoid the Penalty of Death. But now the Fear of God had got ſo much Room in her Heart, that no tampering would do; no Fig-leaves could ſerve her for a Cover; for ſhe knew now that this would have been adding Sin to Sin, and to cover her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a Covering, but not of God's Spirit; and therefore ſhe plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignified to the Court, <hi>That indeed ſhe had committed the miſchievous Fact intendedly, thereby to hide her Shame; and that ſhe having ſinned thus grievouſly, and being affected now with true Repentance, ſhe could by no means excuſe her ſelf, but was willing to undergo the Puniſhment the Law required; and therefore ſhe could not but acknowledge her ſelf guilty, ſince otherwiſe how could ſhe expect Forgiveneſs from the Lord?</hi> This undiſguiſed and free Confeſſion being ſpoken with a ſerious Countenance, did ſo affect the Judge, that Tears trickling down his Face, he ſorrowfully ſaid, <hi>Woman, ſuch a Caſe as this I never met with before; perhaps you, who are but young, and ſpeak ſo piouſly, as being ſtruck to the Heart with Repentance, might yet do much Good in the World; but now you force me, that</hi> ex officio <hi>I muſt pronounce Sentence of Death againſt you, ſince you will admit of no Excuſe.</hi> Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what ſhe had ſaid, the Judge pronounced Sentence of Death. And when afterward ſhe came to the Place of Execution, ſhe made a patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Speech to the People, exhorting the Spectators, eſpecially thoſe that were young, <q>To have the Fear of God before their Eyes, to give heed to his ſecret Reproofs for Evil, and ſo not to grieve and reſiſt the good Spirit of the Lord; which ſhe her ſelf not having timely mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it had made her run on in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

But ſince ſhe firmly truſted to God's infinite Mercy, nay ſurely believed her Sins, tho' of a bloody Dye, to be waſhed off by the pure Blood of Chriſt, ſhe could contentedly depart this Life.</q> Thus ſhe preached at the Gallows the Doctrine of the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſo called, and gave Heart-melting Proofs, that her immortal Soul was to enter into Paradice, as well as anciently that of the Thief on the Croſs. I have been credibly informed by a Perſon who had it from the Mouths of ſuch as were preſent at the Execution, that in her Requeſt to God ſhe prayed, that it might pleaſe him to give a viſible Sign, that ſhe was received into his Favour. And that tho' it was then a cloudy Day, yet immediately after ſhe was turned off, the Clouds broke a little, and the Sun for a few Moments ſhined upon her Face, and preſently after ceaſed ſhining, and the Sky continued overcaſt. She thus in a ſerious Frame of Mind ſuffered Death, which her Crime juſtly deſerved.</p>

               <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> rejected theſe Terms, <hi>as not to be found in Scripture, nor deduceable from</hi> I John v. 7. the Place <hi>Vincent</hi> inſtanced.

G. Whitehead</hi> and <hi>William Penn,</hi> who alſo was there, alledged ſeveral Places from Scripture, proving God's compleat Unity: And they queried <hi>How God was to be underſtood, if in an abſtracted Senſe from his Subſtance?</hi> But inſtead of anſwering the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, they concluded it a Point more fit for Admiration than Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Then <hi>W. Penn</hi> denied the <hi>Minor</hi> Propoſition of <hi>Vincent</hi>'s Syllogiſm; for ſaid he, <hi>No one Subſtance can have three diſtinct Subſiſtences, and preſerve its own <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity: For every Subſiſtence will have its own Subſtance; ſo that three diſtinct Subſiſtences, or Manners of Beings will require three diſtinct Subſtances

or Beings; conſequently three Gods: For if the infinite Godhead ſubſiſts in three ſeparate Manners or Forms, then is not any one of them a perfect and compleat Subſiſtence without the other two: So Parts, and ſomething finite it in God; or if infinite, then three diſtinct infinite Subſiſtences; and what is this, but to aſſert three Gods, ſince none is infinite but God? On the contrary, there being an Inſeparability betwixt the Subſtance and its Subſiſtence, the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of Subſtance will not admit a Trinity of incommunicable or diſtinct Subſiſtences.</hi> After ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Words on both Sides, <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> to bring this ſtrange Doctrine nearer to the Capacity of the People, comparing their three Perſons to three Apoſtles, ſaid, <hi>He did not underſtand, how</hi> Paul, Peter, <hi>and</hi> John <hi>could be three Perſons and one Apoſtle.</hi> At which one <hi>Maddocks,</hi> one of <hi>Vincent</hi>'s Aſſiſtants, framed this odd Syllogiſm, <hi>He that ſcornfully and reproachfully compares our Doctrine of the bleſſed Trinity of Father, Son, and Spirit, one in Eſſence, but three in Perſons, to three finite Men, as</hi> Paul, Peter, <hi>and</hi> John, <hi>is a Blaſphemer. But you</hi> G. Whitehead <hi>have done ſo.</hi> Ergo. A raſh Concluſion; but how firm, let the judicious Reader determine. I have no Mind to enter farther into this Quarrel, ſince the Parties on both Sides went away unſatisfied: For <hi>Vincent</hi> had not been able to prove <hi>the Doctrines of the</hi> Quakers <hi>damnable,</hi> as he had aſſerted. But his Paſſion had tranſported him, as well as when he ſaid from the Pulpit to thoſe of his Society, <hi>That he had as lief they ſhould go to a Bawdy-houſe, as to frequent the</hi> Quakers <hi>Meetings, becauſe of their erroneous and damnable Doctrines.</hi> And pointing to the Window, he farther ſaid, <hi>If there ſhould ſtand a Cup of Poyſon, I would rather drink it, than ſuck in their damnable Doctrines.</hi> But this untimely Zeal did not profit him; for it gave Occaſion to ſome of his Hearers to enquire into the Doctrines of the <hi>Quakers;</hi> and thus ſome came to be convinced of the Truth thereof.</p>

But tho' he was as a Son of Thunder, yet his agreeable Speech flow'd from his Mouth like a pleaſant Stream, to the Conſolation and Comfort of pious Souls. Oh! how pathetically have I heard him pray, when he, as tranſported and raviſhed, humbly beſeeched God, that it might pleaſe him to reach to the hard-hearted, to ſupport the Godly, and to preſerve them ſteadfaſt: Nay, with what a charming and melodious Voice did he ſound forth the PraiſeS of the Moſt High in his publick Prayers!

Be not wanton, nor wild, nor light, but temperate, moderate, and chaſte, and not forward in Words nor Speech, but ſwift to hear, ſlow to ſpeak; and do thou always live with thy Mother, and be a Help unto her, and cheriſh her in her old

            <p>In the Beginning of this Year,<note place="margin">A Yearly Meeting at <hi>London.</hi>
               </note> the Members of this Society held a General Yearly Meeting at <hi>London,</hi> which ſince that Time hath been uſed to be held there annually in the Week called <hi>Whitſon-Week,</hi> becauſe at that Time of the Year it is commonly beſt travelling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Several are deputed from all Places to this Meeting, and what concerns the Church in general is there treated on.</p>
            <p>Perſecution for Religion ſeem'd now to be at a Stand, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed ſome of the moſt rigid Sort of Churchmen, which we not only have already, but may again in due Place demonſtrate.</p>
            <p>About this Time (as I take it) a certain Biſhop ſaid occaſionally, <q>That the <hi>Quakers,</hi> by their unlimited Freedom, increas'd much, and therefore it was very needful to take Care of them, ſeeing they often had much greater Aſſemblies than the national Church; for, ſaid he, at ſuch a Time <hi>I preach'd my ſelf, and there were but a few Hearers, when at the ſame Time the</hi> Quakers <hi>Meeting juſt by was crouded full;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he deſired them to conſider whether it was not high Time to ſtop theſe Sectaries.</q> After he had ſet forth his Matter at large, another Lord then preſent among others, ſaid, <q>That indeed it ſeemed that the Lord Biſhop had ſpoken what was very reaſonable, that the Sectaries had often more Hearers than the national Church-Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and that it was not ſtrange to him that it diſpleaſed him, ſince he took ſo much upon himſelf; for, ſaid he, his Lordſhip obſerv'd, That <hi>he preach'd</hi> himſelf;<note place="margin">A witty Turn upon a Biſhop,</note>

               </q>— This was ſuch a witty Turn upon the Biſhop, as no Doubt made him ſo ſenſible as not to think fit to enter upon the Debate in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Another Account we have of his ſtrange Zeal: When he ſaw how the <hi>Quakers</hi> were bely'd by <hi>William Burnet, Jeremy Ives,</hi> and <hi>Mathew Kaffin,</hi> Teacher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> What! A Papiſt Informer? For two hundred Years ago there was no other publick Profeſſion of Religion but that of the Papiſts in this Nation.</hi> It vexed the Informer, that <hi>G. F.</hi> heard him ſpeak thus; for he now ſaw he was inſnared in his own Talk. When he came into the Court be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord Mayor's Houſe, ſome People who were there, asked <hi>G. F. Why he was brought thither Priſoner? Pray,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ask that Informer, and ask him his Name;</hi> but he would not tell his Name. Then one of the Mayor's Officers looking out at a Window, told him, <hi>He ſhould tell his Name before he went away: For,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>the Lord Mayor will know by what Authority you have intruded your ſelf with Soldiers into the Execution of thoſe Laws which it belongs to the Civil Magiſtrate to execute, and not the Military.</hi> The Informer underſtanding this, got away, but not without ſome Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, becauſe they would not then let him out of the Court; but he forceably pulling open the Door, and being got into the Street, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple gave a great Shout, crying out, <hi>A Papiſt Informer! A Papiſt Informer!</hi> And he would have come off but badly, had not <hi>G. F.</hi> adviſed the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable and Soldiers to keep him out of the Hands of the Common People. Whereupon he went into a Houſe and changed his Perriwig and ſo got away.</p>
            <p>When the Lord Mayor came home, and <hi>G. F.</hi> was brought before him, he ſaid, <hi>Mr.</hi> Fox, <hi>You are an eminent Man among thoſe of your own Profeſſion, pray will you be inſtrumental to perſwade them from meeting in ſuch great Numbers; For,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ſeeing Chriſt hath promiſed, when two or three are met in his Name, he will be in the midſt of them; and the King and Parliament are graciouſly pleaſed to allow of Four to meet together to worſhip God, why will not you be content to partake both of Chriſt's Promiſe to two or three, and the King's Indulgence to Four?</hi> To which <hi>G. F.</hi> anſwered, <q>That Chriſt's Promiſe was not to diſcourage many from meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in his Name; but to encourage the Few, that the feweſt might not forbear to meet, becauſe of their Fewneſs. But if Chriſt hath promiſed to manifeſt his Preſence in the midſt of ſo ſmall an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, where but Two or Three were gathered in his Name; how much more would his Preſence abound where two or three Hundred are gathered in his Name. I wiſh'd him to conſider, Whether this Act would not have taken hold of Chriſt, with his twelve Apoſtles and
<pb n="477" facs="unknown:003104_0488_0FEFF79C401CB790"/>
70 Diſciples,<note place="margin">1670</note> (if it had been in their Time) who uſed to meet often to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and that with great Numbers? However I told him, this Act did not concern us; for it was made againſt ſeditious Meetings, of ſuch as met under Pretence and Colour of Religion, to contrive Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, as (the Act ſays) late Experience had ſhewn; but we had been ſufficiently tried and proved, and always found peaceable: And therefore he ſhould do well to put a Difference between the Innocent and the Guilty. He ſaid, <hi>The Act was made againſt Meetings, and a Worſhip not according to the Liturgy.</hi> I told him, <hi>[according to]</hi> was not the very ſame Thing; and I asked him, Whether the Liturgy was according to the Scriptures? And whether we might not read Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and ſpeak Scriptures? He ſaid, <hi>Yes.</hi> I told him, That this Act took hold only of ſuch <hi>as meet to plot and contrive Inſurrections, as late Experience had ſhewn;</hi> but they had never experienced that by us. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Thieves are ſometimes on the Road, muſt not honeſt Men tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel therefore? And becauſe Plotters and Contrivers have met to do Miſchief, muſt not an honeſt and peaceable People meet to do Good? If we had been a People that did meet <hi>to plot and contrive Inſurrections,</hi> &amp;c. we might have drawn our ſelves into Pours: For Four might do more Miſchief in Plotting, than if there were four Hundred; becauſe Four might ſpeak out their Minds more freely one to another, than four Hundred could. Therefore we being innocent, and not the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple this Act concerns, we keep our Meetings as we uſed to do; and I ſaid, I believed, that he knew in his Conſcience, we were innocent.</q>

            <p>After ſome Time the Heat of Perſecution in the City began to abate, but in other Places it raged more fiercely; this engaged <hi>G. F.</hi> to leave the City, and travel about the Country in divers Places to viſit his Friends.</p>

            <p>In the mean while Perſecution in many Places grew very diſmal; for many of the Friends were beaten with Swords, and Pikes, and Muskets,<note place="margin">Great Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> to that Degree, that their Blood ran along the Ground, and the Inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were ſo very eager to hunt after their Prey, that they informed of Meetings when there was none.

At <hi>Droitwich, John Cartwright</hi> came to a Friend's Houſe there,<note place="margin">An Informer at <hi>Droitwich</hi> in Purſuit of his Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs falls off his Horſe and dies.</note> who ſitting down to Supper, he prayed before they eat, which being heard by an Informer, the Room being next to the Street, he thereupon went immediately and informed that there was a Meeting in the Houſe, and ſo got a Warrant to diſtrain the Goods; and when he came riding with them in the Evening, he fell from his Horſe, and brake his Neck, thereby getting his Death inſtead of his Prey which he hunted after.</p>
            <p>Now altho' Perſecution was not ſo hot in <hi>London,</hi> as in other Places in the Country, yet ſometimes even there it was very ſevere, as may be ſeen by the Inſtance of <hi>William Penn</hi> and <hi>William Mead,</hi> who were taken from a Meeting and impriſoned, and tried for the ſame in the Month of <hi>September.</hi>

It's</hi> Lex non ſcripta, <hi>that which many have ſtudied thirty or forty Years to know, and would you have me tell you in a Moment? Certainly,</hi> replied <hi>W.

I ſay I am a peaceable Man; therefore it is a very proper Queſtion what</hi> W. Penn <hi>demanded in this Caſe, an Oyer of the Law, on which our Indictment is grounded.</hi> To this the Recorder ſaid, <hi>I have made an Anſwer to that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. W.

            <p>For <hi>Brown</hi> himſelf formerly had been an <hi>Independent,</hi> tho' now he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and was of the Court Party. But the Lord Mayor, who it ſeems was a great Friend of <hi>Brown</hi>'s, ſaid to <hi>Mead, You deſerve to have your Tongue cut out. And,</hi> added the Recorder, <hi>If you diſcourſe on this Manner, I ſhall take Occaſion againſt you.</hi> To which <hi>Mead</hi> returned, <hi>Thou didſt promiſe me I ſhould have fair Liberty to be heard. Why may I not have the Privilege of an</hi> Engliſh Man, <hi>and you might be aſhamed of this Dealing.</hi> At this the envious Recorder ſaid, <hi>I look upon you to be an Enemy to the Laws of</hi> England, <hi>which ought to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and kept; nor are you worthy of ſuch Privileges as others have. Mead</hi> well ſeeing that Force and Violence prevailed, and that his ſpeaking could not avail him, ſaid, with a compoſed Mind, <hi>The Lord be Judge between me and thee in this Matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon which he was taken away into the Bale-dock, and the Recorder gave the Jury the following Charge; <q>You have heard what the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is; it is for preaching to the People, and drawing a tumultuous Company after them; and Mr. <hi>Penn</hi> was ſpeaking. If they ſhould not be diſturbed, you ſee they will go on; there are Three or Four Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, that have proved this that he did preach there; that Mr. <hi>Mead</hi> did allow of it; after this, you have heard by ſubſtantial Witneſſes what is ſaid againſt them. Now we are upon the Matter of Fact, which you are to keep to, and obſerve, as what hath been fully ſworn, at your Peril.</q> That the Recorder ſpoke thus to the Jury in the Abſence of the Priſoners, was indeed irregular; wherefore <hi>W.

Penn</hi> ſo enraged the Recorder, that he cryed, <hi>Pull that Fellow down, pull him down:</hi> For <hi>Penn,</hi> it ſeems, to be heard the better, was clamber'd up a little by the Rails of the Bale-dock. Then <hi>W.

I ſay, theſe are barbarous and unjuſt Proceedings.</hi> The Recorder yet more incenſed, cryed, <hi>Take them away into the Hole: To hear them talk all Nights, as they would, that I think doth not become the Honour of the Court.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Priſoners then being kept in a ſtinking Hole, the Jury were commanded up, to agree upon their Verdict: And after an Hour and half's Time eight came down agreed, but four remained above: The Court then ſent an Officer for them, and they accordingly came down. And then the Court uſed many indecent Threats to the four that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented; and after much menacing Language, and a very imperious Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour againſt the Jury, the Priſoners being brought to the Bar, the Foreman was askt, <hi>How ſay you?

You mean he was ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Tumult of People there?</hi> To which the Foreman returned, <hi>My Lord, This was all I had in Commiſſion.</hi> Some of the Jury ſeemed now to buckle to the Queſtions of the Court: but others oppoſed themſelves, and ſaid, <hi>They allowed of no ſuch Word as an</hi> unlawful Aſſembly <hi>in their Verdict:</hi> At which ſome on the Bench took Occaſion to vilify them with opprobrious Language. And becauſe the Court would not diſmiſs the Jury before they gave a more ſatisfactory Verdict, they called for Pen, Ink, and Paper, and ſo went up again: And after half an Hour returning, delivered the following Verdict in Writing.</p>
            <p>

the Meaſure of my Jury's Verdict.</hi> This modeſt Speech ſo incenſed the Recorder, that he cryed, <hi>Stop that prating Fellow's Mouth, or put him out of the Court.</hi> And the Lord Mayor ſaid to the Jury, <hi>You have heard that he preached, that he gathered a Company of tumultuous People, and that they do not only diſobey the martial Power, but the civil alſo.</hi> To which <hi>W. Penn</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>That's a great Miſtake; we did not make the Tumult, but they that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in. The Jury cannot be ſo ignorant, as to think, that we met there with a Deſign to disturb the Civil Peace, ſince (Firſt,) we were by Force of Arms kept out of our lawful Houſe, and met as near it in the Street as the Soldiers would give Leave. And (Secondly,) becauſe it was no new Thing, nor with the Circumſtances expreſſed in the Indictment, but what was uſual and cuſtomary with us. It's very well known that we are a peaceable People, and cannot offer Violence to any Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Court now being reſolved to ſend the Priſoners to their Jail, and the Jury to their Chamber, <hi>Penn</hi> ſpoke as followeth, <hi>The Agreement of twelve Men is a Verdict in Law, and ſuch an one being given by the Jury, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the Clerk of the Peace to record it, as he will anſwer it at his Peril. And if the Jury bring in another Verdict, contradictory to this, I affirm they are perjured Men in Law.</hi> And looking upon the Jury, ſaid, <hi>You are</hi> Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <hi>mind your Privilege; give not away your Right.</hi> To which <hi>E. Buſhel,</hi> one of them, returned, <hi>Nor will we ever do it.</hi> Another of the Jurymen pleaded Indiſpoſition of Body, and therefore deſired to be diſmiſs'd; but the Lord Mayor ſaid, <hi>You are as ſtrong as any of them; ſtarve them, and hold your Principles.</hi> To which the Recorder added, <hi>Gentlemen, you muſt be content with your hard Fate; let your Patience overcome it; for the Court is reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to have a Verdict, and that before you can be diſmiſs'd.</hi> And tho' the Jury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſaid, <hi>We are agreed, we are agreed, we are agreed,</hi> yet the Court ſwore ſeveral Perſons, to keep the Jury all Night, without Meat, Drink, Fire, or any other Accommodation; nay, they had not ſo much as a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-pot, tho' deſired. Thus Force and Violence prevail'd. The next Day, tho' it was the firſt of the Week, vulgarly called <hi>Sunday,</hi> the Court ſat again; and the Priſoners being brought to the Bar, the Jury were called in, and their Foreman was ask'd, <hi>Is</hi> William Penn <hi>guilty of the Matter whereof he ſtands indicted, in Manner and Form aforeſaid, or not guilty?</hi> To which he anſwered as before, William Penn <hi>is guilty of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Grace-church-ſtreet.</hi> The Lord Mayor then asking, <hi>To an unlawful Aſſembly? Edward Buſhel</hi> anſwered, <hi>No, my Lord, we give no other Verdict than what we gave laſt Night; we have no other Verdict to give. You are,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the Lord Mayor, <hi>a factious Fellow: I'll take a Courſe with you. I have,</hi> ſaid <hi>Buſhel, done according to my, Conſcience.</hi> This ſo diſpleaſed the Mayor, that he ſaid, <hi>That Conſcience of yours would cut my Throat; but I will cut yours ſo ſoon as I can.</hi> To which the Recorder added, <hi>He has inſpired the Jury; he has the Spirit of Divination; methinks I feel him: I will have a poſitive Verdict, or you ſhall ſtarve for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then <hi>W. Penn</hi> ſaid, <hi>I deſire to ask the</hi> Recorder <hi>one Queſtion: Do you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of the Verdict given of</hi> W. Mead? To which the Recorder anſwer'd, <hi>It cannot be a Verdict, becauſe you are indicted for a Conſpiracy; and one bring found</hi> Not guilty, <hi>and not the other, it cannot be a Verdict.</hi> This made <hi>Penn</hi> ſay, <hi>If</hi> Not guilty <hi>be not a Verdict, then you make of the Jury and</hi> Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Charta <hi>but a meer Noſe of Wax. How!</hi> ask'd <hi>William Mead</hi> then, <hi>Is</hi> Not guilty, <hi>no Verdict? No,</hi> ſaid the Recorder, <hi>it is no Verdict.</hi> To which <hi>Penn</hi> replied, <hi>I affirm that the Conſent of a Jury is a Verdict in Law; and if</hi> W. Mead <hi>he not guilty, it conſequently follows, that I am clear, ſince you have indicted us of Conſpiracy, and I could not poſſibly conſpire alone.</hi> After this, the Court ſpoke to the Jury, and cauſed them to go up again, if poſſible to extort another Verdict from them. Then the Jury being called, and ask'd by the Clerk, <hi>What ſay you? Is</hi> William Penn <hi>guilty of the Matter whereof he ſtands indicted, in Manner and Form aforeſaid, or not guilty?</hi>

            <p>This Trial<note n="*" place="margin">To which the Reader is referr'd, as well worthy his Peruſal.</note> was afterwards publiſh'd in Print more at large than is ſet down here, and an Appendix ſubjoyned to it; in which are ſhewed not only the Invalidity of the Evidence, but alſo the Abſurdity of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment, and the illegal Proceedings of the Court; and from the Great Charter,<note place="margin">In the Caſe of the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Keel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of fining Juries for their Verdicts declared il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal.</note> that they had been dealt with contrary to Law. The Caſe of the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Keeling</hi> is alſo mention'd, who having put Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints upon Juries, a Commitee of the Parliament the 11th of <hi>December</hi> 1667, came to this Reſolution, <hi>That his Proceedings were Innovations, in the Trial of Men for their Lives and Liberties; and that he had uſed an arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and illegal Power, which was of dangerous Conſequence to the Lives and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the People of</hi> England, <hi>and tended to the introducing an arbitrary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi> Moreover, <hi>That in the Place of Judicature he had undervalued, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified and condemned</hi> Magna Charta. And therefore, <hi>That he ſhould be brought to Trial, in order to condign Puniſhment, in ſuch Manner as the Houſe ſhould judge moſt fit and requiſite.</hi> Two Days after, <hi>viz. Die Veneris,</hi> the 13th of <hi>December,</hi> it was reſolved, <hi>That the Precedents and Practice of fining or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoning Jurors for Verdicts, is illegal.</hi> The Book containing the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Trial of <hi>W. Penn</hi> and <hi>W. Mead</hi> was reprinted I think more than once; for it came to be much in Requeſt, becauſe the Liberties of the People were therein well defended, and arbitrary Power controlled. The Title of it was, <hi>The People's Ancient and Juſt Liberties aſſerted;</hi> and underneath was added this well known Verſe or <hi>Juvenal,</hi>
            </p>
            <q>Sic volo, ſic jubeo; ſtat pro ratione voluntas.</q>
            <p>This Matter was more circumſtantially treated of in a Book in Print,<note place="margin">A farther Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of theſe Proceedings publiſhed by <hi>T.

And having ſometimes vigorouſly pleaded the Cauſe of the Oppreſſed, he alſo became the Object of perſecuting Fury, which could not endure his faithful defending of the Innocent. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Summer the Magiſtrates of <hi>London</hi> iſſued out a Warrant to break open his Houſe in the Dead of the Night, in Order to apprehend him; and this Warrant was executed by the Soldiers of one Captain <hi>Holford;</hi> and the next Day he was ſent to <hi>Newgate</hi> by a <hi>Mittimus</hi> under the Hands and Seals of the Lord Mayor <hi>Samuel Starling, William Peak, Robert Hanſon,</hi> and ſeveral others, under Pretence, <hi>That he ſtirred up Perſons to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience of the Laws, and abetted and encouraged ſuch as met in unlawful and ſeditious Conventicles, contrarry to the late Act.</hi> But his Caſe being brought before the Juſtices of the Court of <hi>Common-pleas</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> by an <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> that Court, after ſolemn Debate, gave their Judgment, <hi>That</hi> Thomas Rudyard <hi>was unjuſtly impriſoned, and unlawfully detained.</hi>
               <pb n="485" facs="unknown:003104_0496_0FEFF7A5AADB0220"/>
And ſo he was ſet at Liberty. But the Lord Mayor <hi>S. Starling</hi> fretting at his Diſcharge,<note place="margin">But remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Cauſe to the Common-Pleas is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted.</note> found out new Stratagems to compaſs his Ends upon him. For an Indictment was formed againſt him for having hindred due Courſe of Law againſt one <hi>Samuel Allingbridge.</hi> But <hi>Rudyard</hi> ſo well defended himſelf, that he was acquitted; which ſo incenſed the Lord Mayor, that not long after he was again committed to <hi>Newgate,</hi> on a religious Account,<note place="margin">And again, in another Proſecution. He is again preceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of which he printed.</note> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> for having been in the Meeting at <hi>White-Hart-Court</hi> in <hi>Grace-Church-ſtreet.</hi> The Proceedings againſt him and others on that Account were no leſs arbitrary than thoſe againſt <hi>W. Penn</hi> and <hi>W. Mead</hi> already mentioned, and therefore <hi>Rudyard</hi> expoſed his and their Tryals in Print; and ſeeing he underſtood the Law, he was the more able to ſhew the Unjuſtneſs of theſe Proceedings, and how inconſiſtent ſuch Proſecutions were with the Laws of the Land.</p>
            <p>But to avoid Prolixity, I ſhall relate but little of them, ſince many Things occur therein, which have been mentioned already in other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. How the Recorder <hi>Howel</hi> was inclined in reſpect to Religion, may be deduced from what hath been ſaid already of his Panegyrick upon the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Inquiſition. And to <hi>Rudyard</hi> and his Fellow-Priſoners he gave no obſcure Evidence what Religion he preferred;<note place="margin">A Touch at the Religion of <hi>Howel</hi> the Recorder.</note> for they ſaying, <hi>That they were always quiet and peaceable in their Aſſemblies, and that the Laws againſt Riots were never intended againſt them, but Popiſh, or ſuch like Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Peace.</hi> The Recorder returned, <hi>That the</hi> Papiſts <hi>were better Subjects to the King, than they were; and that they were a ſtubborn and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous People, and muſt either be brought under, or there was no ſafe living by them.</hi> The Priſoners offering to vindicate themſelves from theſe odious and ſoul Aſperſions, were not ſuffered to ſay any Thing in their own Defence; but inſtead of hearing them, they were by Order of the Lord Mayor and the Recorder thruſt into the Bale-dock, and treated almoſt at the ſame Rate as <hi>W. Penn</hi> and <hi>W. Mead</hi> had been before.</p>
            <p>But Violence prevailed now; and the Recorder, becauſe of his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious Behaviour againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> was ſo much in Favour of the Court of Juſtice, that Alderman <hi>Jo. Robinſon</hi> did not ſtick to tell them, <hi>That the Recorder deſerved an hundred Pounds for his Service done at the</hi> Old Baily <hi>the laſt Seſſions.</hi>
               <note place="margin">To whom 100<abbr>

                  </abbr> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</note> And his Propoſal ſo took, that the Court con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to pay him for the ſaid Service an hundred Pounds by the Chamberlain of <hi>London.</hi> And ſince this was very well known to <hi>T. Rudyard,</hi> inſomuch that in a Book he publiſhed, he named the Date of the ſaid Order, <hi>viz.</hi> the Eighth of <hi>October,</hi> 1670; and that, other Orders that had been given for two Hundred Pounds more to him, within eight Months laſt paſt; he, to reprehend ſuch Doings in a Saty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Way, called them, <hi>An excellent Way to eaſe the Treaſury of being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthened with Orphans-Money, by which ſiniſter Ends, and curſed Diſpoſitions of its Caſh, the Chamber was ſo deeply in Debt, that it was almoſt incredible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now ſince <hi>Rudyard</hi> as a Lawyer, had a more full Knowledge of theſe unlawful Proceedings againſt him and his Friends, than many others, he compoſed a Treatiſe of thoſe Proſecutions, which he called, <hi>The Second Part of the Peoples Ancient and Juſt Liberties, aſſerted.</hi> And true Lovers of their Country were pleaſed with it: For that Party, which countenanced Popery, and therefore endeavoured to violate the People's Rights, ſtrove to get the upper Hand.</p>
            <p>Perſecution was now very hot and fierce all over the Country,<note place="margin">Wicked Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers againſt Diſſenters.</note> becauſe a Door was opened for all baſe and wicked Fellows to get Booty by informing; for by the Act againſt Meetings (which, tho' religious, were branded with the Name of <hi>Seditious)</hi> the Informer was to have a third Part of the impoſed Fine.

Nay, ſometimes they ſwore only by gueſs, that in ſuch a Place a Meeting had been kept, tho' the Witneſſes had not ſeen it, as was requiſite by Law.

It is no Matter if there were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Thought in their Hearts as to Plotting or contriving Inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (for which the Law was made) they being there, it is ſufficient to have them fined Five Shillings a-piece the firſt Time, and twenty Pounds for the Houſe; and for the ſecond Time ten Shillings a-piece; and if the Juſtices be not well adviſed, it may be, for the ſecond Time for the Houſe you may get twenty Pounds more, altho' the Act doth not grant it.

When he had ended ſpeaking, the Chairman <hi>Simpſon</hi> ſaid, <hi>Your Relation or Account is very innocent.</hi> Then he and <hi>Parker</hi> having whiſper'd a while together, the ſaid Chairman ſtood up and ſaid, <hi>You Mr.</hi> Fox <hi>are a famous Man; and all this may be true which you have ſaid; but that we may be the better ſatisfied, will you take the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy?</hi> Now, tho' <hi>G. F.</hi> anſwered to this, <hi>That they had ſaid they would not inſnare him, and that this was a plain Snare, ſince they knew he and his Friends would not take any Oath;</hi> all was in vain, and they cauſed the Oath to be read; which being done, he told them, <hi>I never took Oath in my Life, but I have always been true to the Government. I was caſt into the Dungeon at</hi> Darby, <hi>and kept Priſoner ſix Months there, becauſe I would not take up Arms againſt King</hi> Charles <hi>at</hi> Worceſter-Fight: <hi>And for going to Meetings, I was carried out of</hi> Leiceſter, <hi>and brought before</hi> Oliver Cromwel, <hi>as a Plotter to bring in King</hi> Charles: <hi>And ye know in your own Conſciences, that we, the People called</hi> Quakers, <hi>cannot take an Oath, or ſwear in any Caſe, becauſe Chriſt hath forbidden it. But as to the Matter or Subſtance contain'd in the Oaths, this I can ſay and do, that I do own and acknowledge the King of</hi> England <hi>to be lawful Heir and Succeſſor to the Realm of</hi> England; <hi>and do abhor all Plots and Plotters, and Contrivances againſt him; and I have

nothing in my Heart but Love and good Will to him and all Men, and deſire his and their Proſperity; the Lord knows it, before whom I ſtand an innocent Man. And as to the Oath of Supremacy, I deny the Pope and his Power, and abhor it with my Heart.</hi> Whilſt he was yet ſpeaking, they cried, <hi>Give him the Book,</hi> viz. the Bible. <hi>The book,</hi> ſaith <hi>G. F ſaith, Swear not at all:</hi> And he going on to declare his Mind farther, they cried, <hi>Take him away Jailor;</hi> who not ſhewing himſelf very forward, they cry'd again, <hi>Take him away: We ſhall have a Meeting here; why do you not take him away?</hi> And one of the Bench ſaid, <hi>That Fellow,</hi> meaning the Jailor, <hi>loves to hear him preach.</hi>

               <hi>Lower</hi> asked then, <hi>Why his Father-in-law might not be ſet at Liberty, as well as he, ſince they were both taken together, and their Caſe was alike?</hi> But they telling him, <hi>they would not hear him,</hi> ſaid, <hi>You may be gone about your Buſineſs, for we have nothing more to ſay to you, ſeeing you are diſcharged.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was all he could get from them; therefore after the Court was riſen, he went to ſpeak with them at their Chamber, deſiring to know <hi>what Cauſe they had to detain his Father, ſeeing they had diſcharged him;</hi> and wiſhing them <hi>to conſider, whether this was not Partiality,</hi> Upon this <hi>Simp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> ſaid, <hi>If you be not content, we will tender you the Oath alſo, and ſend you to your Father.</hi> To which <hi>Lower</hi> replied, <hi>Ye may do that, if ye think fit; but whether ye ſend me or no, I intend to go, and wait upon my Father in Priſon; for that is now my Buſineſs in this Country.</hi> Then Juſtice <hi>Parker</hi> ſaid to him, <hi>Do you think, Mr.</hi> Lower, <hi>that I had no Cauſe to ſend your Father and you to Priſon, when you had ſuch a great Meeting; inſomuch that the Parſon of the Pariſh complained to me, that he had loſt the greateſt Part of his Pariſhioners; ſo that when he comes amongſt them, he hath ſcarce any Auditors left?</hi> To this <hi>Lower</hi> returned,<note place="margin">

had been tendred to him; and alſo what he had offered to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices as a Declaration, that he was willing to ſign, inſtead of the ſaid Oaths. To this it was told him by the Chief Juſtice, <hi>that they would conſider farther of it.</hi> Being then delivered to the Keeper of the King's Bench, he was ſuffered to go and lodge at the Houſe of one of his Friends; for tho' he continued a Priſoner, yet they were ſufficiently perſwaded that he would not run away.<note place="margin">But thro' the Inſinuations of Juſtice <hi>Parker,</hi> as it was ſaid, and ſuperior Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, he is remitted to the next Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes</note> But after this, Juſtice <hi>Parker,</hi> as it was ſaid, moved the Court, that <hi>G.

            <p>A Day then being appointed for another Hearing, and <hi>G.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>G.

Having in my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Proceedings before the King's Bench paſs'd by moſt Part of the the pleading, ſo I ſhall do here likewiſe, to avoid Repetitions of what hath been ſeveral Times related already concerning ſuch Kind of Trials; yet I can't paſs by in Silence, that after he had given an Account of his Journey before he was taken, he added, <hi>That ſince his Impriſonment, he had underſtood, that his Mother, who was an ancient and weak Woman, and had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to ſee him before ſhe died, hearing that he was ſtopt and impriſoned in his Journey, ſo that he was not likely to come and ſee her, it ſtruck her ſo that ſhe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſoon after; which had been very hard to him.</hi> Judge <hi>Turner,</hi> who former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had been ſevere to him, ſeemed now (as ſome thought) inclined to have him ſet at Liberty, ſince he ſaw they had nothing juſtly againſt him; but <hi>Parker,</hi> who had committed him, endeavoured to incenſe the Judge againſt him; for if he had been releaſed, then he himſelf muſt have born the Blame of having committed <hi>G.

with Prieſts too, one of which ask'd him, <hi>Whether he was grown up to Perfection?</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Prieſt puts ſeveral Queſtions to <hi>G. F.</hi> which he anſwers.</note> To which he anſwered, <hi>What he was, he was by the Grace of God. This is</hi> replied the Prieſt, <hi>a modeſt and civil Anſwer. But,</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued he in the Words of the Apoſtle <hi>John, If we ſay that we have no Sin we deceive our ſelves, and the Truth is not in us.</hi> And asking, <hi>What he ſaid to that? G. F.</hi> returned with the Words of the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>If we ſay that we have not ſinned, we make him a Liar, and his Word is not in us.</hi> Moreover he ſaid, <hi>Chriſt came to deſtroy Sin, and to take away Sin. There is a Time for People to ſee that they have ſinned, and there is a Time for them to confeſs their Sin, and to forſake it, and to know the Blood of Chriſt to cleanſe from all Sin.</hi> After ſome more reaſoning, the Prieſt ſaid, <hi>We muſt always be ſtriving:</hi> To which <hi>G. F.</hi> returned, <hi>That it was a ſad and comfortleſs Sort of ſtriving, to ſtrive with a Belief that we ſhould never overcome:</hi> And he told him alſo, <hi>That</hi> Paul, <hi>who once cried out becauſe of the Body of Death, did alſo thank God, who gave him the Victory; and that he ſaid,</hi> There is no Condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus: <hi>So that there was a Time of crying out for Want of Victory, and a Time praiſing God for the Victory.</hi> But, ſaid the Prieſt, <hi>Job was not perfect.</hi> To which <hi>G. F.</hi> returned that God hath ſignified in Scripture, <hi>That</hi> Job <hi>was perfect and upright, and that he eſchewed Evil; and that the Devil himſelf was forced to confeſs, that God had ſet an Hedge about him; which was not an outward Hedge, but the inviſible heavenly Power. Yet ſaid</hi> Job, replied the Prieſt, <hi>He chargeth his Angels with Folly, and the Heavens are not clean in his Sight. That's a Miſtake,</hi> ſaid <hi>G. F. for it was not</hi> Job <hi>ſaid so, but</hi> Eliphaz <hi>who contended againſt</hi> Job. <hi>Well but,</hi> ſaid the Prieſt, <hi>What ſay you to that Scripture,</hi> The juſteſt Man that is, ſinneth ſeven Times a Day? <hi>There is</hi> anſwered <hi>G.

                  <hi>G. F.</hi> appears again at the Seſſions.</note> where the Juſtice, who was Chairman, was one <hi>Street. G.

F. <hi>had a Meeting at</hi> Tredington <hi>from all Parts of the Nation, to the terrifying of the King's Subjects; for which he had been committed, and that for the Trial of his Fidelity, the Oaths had been ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to him.</hi> And then turning to <hi>G. F.</hi> he askt him, <hi>Since he had time to conſider of it, whether he would now take the Oaths? G. F.</hi> having obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Liberty to ſpeak for himſelf, gave a Relation of his Journey, and ſhewed that he and his Friends had in no wiſe kept a Meeting that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned Terror to any of the King's Subjects; and as to the Oaths, he ſhewed why he could not take them, and what he could declare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead thereof. But notwithſtanding all this, the Oaths were read to him again; and he perſiſting in his Refuſal to take them, the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was read alſo; and afterwards the Chairman asked him. <hi>If he was guilty?

F.</hi> returned, <hi>It was not a true Form.</hi> Then the Chairman told the Jury, what they ſhould do in this Caſe; and before they gave in their Verdict, <hi>G. F.</hi> ſaid to them, <hi>That it was for Chriſt's-Sake, and in Obedience to his and his Apoſtle's Command that he could not ſwear: And therefore</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>take heed what ye do; for before his Judgment-Seat ye ſhall all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>M. Fox</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints the King with her Husband's Condition, &amp; he refers her to Chancellor <hi>Finch.</hi>
               </note> His Wife was come to him before that Time, and after having been with him about ſeventeen Weeks, and no Diſcharge like to be obtained for him, ſhe went up to <hi>London,</hi> and being come to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the King there, ſhe gave him an Account of her Husband's long Impriſonment, and how weak he was, and not without Danger of his Life. To which the King ſaid, <hi>He could do nothing in it, but ſhe muſt go to the Chancellor.</hi> And ſo ſhe went to the Lord <hi>Finch,</hi> who was then Chancellor, and having given him an Account of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſhe told him, <q>That the King had left it wholly to him; and if he did not ſhew Pity, and releaſe her Husband out of Priſon, ſhe feared he would end his Days there.</q> But the Chancellor ſaid to her,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>G. F.</hi> not free to accept of a Pardon.</note> 
               <hi>That the King could not releaſe him otherwiſe than by a Pardon.</hi> Now <hi>G. F.</hi> could not reſolve to be freed thus, as well knowing he had done no Evil; and therefore he would rather have lain in Priſon all his Days, than to be thus ſet at Liberty; otherwiſe he needed not to have lain ſo long, ſince the King had been willing long before to have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him a Pardon, and alſo had ſaid to one <hi>Thomas More,</hi> 
               <q>That <hi>G. F.</hi> needed not ſcruple being releaſed by a Pardon; for many a Man, that was as innocent as a Child, had had a Pardon granted him.</q> 
               <hi>G. F.</hi> unwilling to have a Pardon, but deſiring to have the Validity of his Indictment tried before the Judges, the Lord Chancellor, who ſhewed himſelf a diſcreet Man, procured that an <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> was <pb n="501" facs="unknown:003104_0512_0FEFF828E77793A0"/>

Thus it became neceſſary to ſend to <hi>London</hi> again; and another Order was got and ſent down to bring up <hi>G. F.</hi> before the King's Bench.

And ſince it appeared that <hi>Corbet</hi> was in the right, they choſe to let their Plea fall, perhaps for Fear of worſe Conſequence. And thus they began to examine the Errors of the Indictment, which proved to be ſo many and ſo groſs, that all the Judges were of Opinion, <hi>That the Indictment was quaſh'd and void, and that</hi> G.

Keith</hi> anſwered thus: <hi>We are to conſider that the Terms or Names Jeſus Chriſt, are ſometimes applied to him as God, and ſometimes to him as Man; yea ſometimes to the very Body of Jeſus: But the Queſtion is, whether do thoſe Names more properly, immediately, and originally belong to him as God, or as he was before he took the Manhood upon him, or to the Manhood? We affirm, thoſe Names are given to him moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and eminently as God; and leſs properly, yet truly, as Man; and leaſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to his Body, yea to his dead Body.</hi> Then <hi>J.

Ives</hi> aded, <hi>They that ſay Chriſt cannot be ſeen with carnal Eyes, and was never viſible to wicked Men, do deny the Lord's Chriſt; for he was ſeen with carnal Eyes, and by wicked Men.</hi> To this <hi>W. Penn</hi> ſaid, <hi>I diſtinguiſh upon the Word ſeen; wicked Men might ſee him in that bodily Appearance, and yet not ſee him to be the Chriſt of God; they ſaw his Manhood, but not his Chriſtſhip: This I will prove from Chriſt's Words to</hi> Peter, <hi>when he confeſſed him to be Chriſt, the Son of the living God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. xvi. 16, 17.</note> viz. <hi>Fleſh and Blood hath not revealed this unto thee, but my Father which is in Heaven:</hi> Therefore <hi>Peter</hi> with a carnal Eye could not have ſeen the Lord's Chriſt, much leſs wicked Men.

ſeems we muſt be here to be catechiſed, and ye will not anſwer us one Queſtion, yet I ſhall anſwer</hi> J. Ives <hi>his Queſtion, if he will promiſe to anſwer mine. Ives</hi> then ſaying that he would anſwer it, <hi>W. Penn</hi> returned, <hi>I here declare that we do faithfully believe that holy Manhood to be a Member of the Chriſt of God:</hi> And directing his Queſtion to <hi>Ives,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>Was he the Chriſt of God before he was manifeſt in the Fleſh? He was,</hi> anſwered <hi>Ives, the Son of God. But,</hi> replied <hi>W. Penn, was be the Lord's Chriſt? I will prove him to have been the Lord's Chriſt as well before as after: Firſt from the Apoſtle</hi> Paul<hi>'s Words to the</hi> Corinthians,<note place="margin">1 Cor. x. 4.</note> That Rock was Chriſt: <hi>Next from</hi> Jude, <hi>where ſome</hi> Greek <hi>Copies have it thus,</hi> That Jeſus brought the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> But to this <hi>Ives</hi> gave no Anſwer, how often ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he was called upon for it. And this was no great Wonder, ſince it was well known that there were ſuch among the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> who fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the <hi>Socinian</hi> Principles. But <hi>Ives,</hi> that he might not appear altogether mute, came on again with a Queſtion, viz. <hi>Do ye believe that Chriſt in his human Nature is in Heaven?</hi> This made <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> ſay to the Auditory, <hi>Ye have heard the Charge againſt us, and the Diſtinction that hath been made between</hi> Seeing <hi>and</hi> Seeing <hi>of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>as namely between the ſpiritual ſaving Sight of the Lord's Chriſt, and the Seeing of his outward Man, Perſon, or Body. In this laſt Senſe it could never be intended that it was not viſible to the outward Eye; but it was the ſpiritual Rock which all</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael <hi>drank of, and as he was before</hi> Abraham <hi>was, and as glorified with the Father before the World began; and as Chriſt himſelf ſaid to</hi> Philip, He that ſeeth me, ſeeth my Father alſo: <hi>And only Saints, or Children of Light, could truly ſay,</hi> We have ſeen his Glory as the only Begotten of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, full of Grace and Truth. <hi>In all which Conſiderations, or Senſes of Seeing, the Lord's Chriſt was only ſeen ſpiritually, and not with carnal Eyes.</hi> This <hi>Ives</hi> granted that ſo it might be left: Yet preſently after, inſtead of proving the <hi>Quakers</hi> no Chriſtians, he askt again, <hi>Do ye believe or own that Chriſt is in Heaven with his humane Nature?</hi> To which <hi>W. Penn</hi> anſwered, <hi>We do believe the Man Chriſt Jeſus to be glorified in Heaven.</hi> Which Anſwer <hi>Ives</hi> refuſing to accept, becauſe it was not in the Terms of his Queſtion, <hi>Penn</hi> askt, <hi>What Difference doſt thou make between the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and humane Nature of Chriſt? None,</hi> returned <hi>Ives, if you mean candid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> To which <hi>Penn</hi> replied, <hi>I do mean and ſpeak candidly; we do believe that holy Manhood to be in heavenly Glory.</hi> Now ſince it began to grow dark, the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> deſired to leave off, and to reſume the Matter at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Time; as was done alſo: But the Parties did not agree for all that; for tho' the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> continued to aſſert that the <hi>Quakers</hi> were no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, yet theſe had abundance of Reaſons to maintain the contrary; and this they did ſo effectually, that thoſe of the other Party, under a Pretence of the Meeting-Place's being overcharged with People, and that the Gallery gave Way, broke up the Meeting, without a final Concluſion.</p>

One of the Leaders of this turbulent Company was the Son of one <hi>Abraham Seward,</hi> who about this Time was elected Mayor; but when Complaints were made to him of the outragious Actions of the ſaid wicked Crew, he pretended to be ignorant of his Son's Doings, and for all that threatned thoſe that came to him, with the Execution of the Law upon them, if they did not leave off to keep Meetings. And as it was well known that the chief Maſter of the Town-School was diſpleaſed at the extravagant Inſolency of ſome of his Scholars, ſo it was reported alſo that he was forbidden to correct them for it; and that the College Prieſts had ſet them on, and ſaid they would bear them out in what they did: For ſome of thoſe brutiſh Boys were Choriſters. Two Friends went to the Juſtices, <hi>Robert Simons</hi> and <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Simons,</hi> to acquaint them with the exceſſive Abuſes they met with. But the Juſtices not at all regarding their Complaint, the ſaid <hi>Robert</hi> endeavoured to draw ſome Confeſſion of a Meeting from one of them, intending, as he himſelf ſaid, immediately to have fined him, if he had confeſſed; but he was wary. Now ſince the Inſolency of the Boys was thus encouraged by Authority, it was no Wonder it continued there a whole Year. At length eight Men were taken from the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by the aforeſaid Mayor <hi>Abraham Seward,</hi> and carried to the Town-hall; and in their Paſſage along he ſaid, <hi>They ſhould never meet there more.</hi> To which a Friend going with him, ſaid, <hi>We are a People ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by the Power of the Lord; and therefore the Power of Man cannot ſcatter us.</hi> Being come to the Town-hall, the Oaths of Allegiance and Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy were tendred to them; on which they ſaid, <hi>We are Chriſtians, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot break the Command of Chriſt, which forbids</hi> to ſwear at all; <hi>but to render juſt and lawful Allegiance to the King, we do not deny, nor refuſe.</hi> And they perſiſting in their Refuſal to ſwear, were committed to Priſon. The next Day after, one <hi>Walter Rogers,</hi> a Prebend, walking by the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſe, and obſerving how it was broken, ſaid to ſome, <hi>That they were very good Boys, and had done their Work better than he thought they had.</hi>

But an Example of an inward ſupernatural Senſe is, when the Heart or Soul of a pious Man feels in it ſelf divine Motions, Influences, and Operations, which ſometimes are as the Voice or Speech of <hi>God,</hi> ſometimes as a moſt pleaſant and glorious Illuſtration or viſible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the inward Eye, ſometimes as a moſt ſweet Savour or Taſte, ſometimes as an heavenly and divine Warmneſs, or (ſo to ſpeak) Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Soul in the Love of God. Moreover this divine and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Operation in the Mind of Man, is a true and moſt glorious Miracle; which when it is perceived by the inward and ſupernatural Senſe divinely rais'd up in the Mind of Man, doth ſo evidently and clearly perſuade the Underſtanding to aſſent to the Thing revealed, that there is no Need of an outward Miracle: For this Aſſent is not becauſe of the Thing it ſelf, but becauſe of the <hi>Revelation</hi> propoſing it, which is the <hi>Voice</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> For when the <hi>Voice</hi> of God is heard in the <hi>Soul,</hi> the Soul doth as certainly conclude the <hi>Truth</hi> of that Voice, as the Truth of God's Being, from whom it proceeds.</p>

And it is no leſs abſurd, to require of God, who is a moſt pure Spirit, to manifeſt his Will to Men by the outward Senſes, elſe not to be credited; as to require us to ſee Sounds, and hear Light and Colours.

No outward Revelation doth make this known unto them; but <hi>The Spirit</hi> (as ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>beareth witneſs with our Sprits, that we are the Children of God.</hi> For the meer Teſtimony of a humane Conſcience, without the inward Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the holy Spirit, cannot beget in us a firm and immoveable Teſtimony of our Sonſhip, becauſe the Heart of Man is deceitful; and if the Teſtimony thereof were true, at moſt it is but a humane Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, which begetteth in us only a humane Faith: But that Faith, by which holy Men believe they are the Sons of God, is a divine Faith, which leans upon a divine Teſtimony of the holy Spirit, witneſſing in them, that they are the Sons of God. Moreover, when a good Man feels in himſelf that undeclarable Joy of the holy Spirit, concerning which the holy Scripture ſpeaks, and which is the common Privilege of the Saints, how or whence feels he this Joy? Truly, this Argument concludes no leſs againſt this heavenly ſpiritual Joy, which is begotten in the Souls of the Saints by the holy Spirit, than it does againſt the <hi>immediate Revelation</hi> of God: For there is no natural Idea of this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Joy, elſe meer natural Men, yea ſuch as are profane and ungodly,

would feel it as much as the godly: But becauſe it is a ſupernatural Thing, therefore it can have no true Idea but what is ſupernatural. Moreover whence is it that profane Men feel ſometimes in themſelves the Wrath of God as Fire,<note place="margin">How profane Men do feel the Wrath of God as Fire.</note> when all Things as to the outward, go as proſperouſly with them as with the Godly, and oftentimes more proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perouſly?

There is alſo an inward Grief oftentimes raiſed up in wicked Men from the Senſe of this Wrath of God, which very much vexeth and tormenteth their Minds; and nevertheleſs this Grief hath no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Idea in us: For oftentimes wicked Men feel not this Sorrow; for God ſometimes is, as it were, ſilent, while the wicked ſin, as in <hi>Pſal. i.</hi>

For this Argument ſeemeth to do no leſS Injury to the Saints, than to rob them of this moſt glorious Treaſure both in this Life, and that to come. For there is in us no natural Idea of this divine Glory, as there is not of GOD himſelf, which is any ways proportionable unto ſo great Happineſs, which the Scripture ſo much declareth of, by which the Godly are rewarded partly in this Life, and plenarily in that which is to come.<note place="margin">The Exiſtence of a moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted.</note> We confeſs indeed, there is in all Men, as well the Godly as Ungodly, ſome Sort of Idea of GOD as of a moſt perfect Being; and that therefore this Propoſtion, <hi>There exiſteth a moſt perfect Being,</hi> doth as clearly appear to humane Underſtanding, as that <hi>The Whole is greater than the Part,</hi> And therefore this Propoſition, <hi>That a moſt perfect Being exiſteth,</hi> ought to be numbered among the Principles that of themſelves are manifeſt.

                     <pb n="523" facs="unknown:003104_0534_0FEFF84689C05A68"/>There is then either no ſuch <hi>Viſion of GOD,</hi> neither in this Life, nor in that to come; or there is a <hi>ſupernatural Idea</hi> of GOD,<note place="margin">The <hi>ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Idea</hi> of God differs from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.</note>

But the Happineſs of the Saints conſiſts not in contemplating this natural Idea of God, elſe the Wicked would be as happy as the Godly; yea, the very Devil, as the moſt holy Angel: Since, as is ſaid, both the Devil and moſt wicked Men do as clearly perceive this natural Idea of GOD, as the moſt holy Men or Angels.</p>
                  <p>If the Scripture then be true,<note place="margin">There is in all Men a <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Idea</hi> of God.</note> there is in Men a <hi>ſupernatural Idea</hi> of God, which altogether differs from this natural Idea: I ſay, <hi>in all Men;</hi> becauſe all Men are capable of Salvation, and conſequently of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this <hi>divine Viſion.</hi> Now this Capacity conſiſteth herein, that they have ſuch a ſupernatural Idea in themſelves: For if there were no ſuch Idea in them, it were impoſſible they ſhould ſo know GOD. <hi>For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is clearly and diſtinctly known, is known by its proper Idea;</hi> neither can it otherways be clearly and diſtinctly known: For the Ideas of all Things are divinely planted in our Souls; for they are not begotten in us by outward Objects, or outward Cauſes, (as the better philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy teacheth) but only are by theſe outward Things excited or ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up. And this is true not only in ſupernatural Ideas of GOD and Things divine, and in natural Ideas of the natural Principles of humane Underſtanding, and Concluſions thence deduced by the Strength of humane Reaſon; but even in the Ideas of outward Objects, which are perceived by the outward Senſes; as that noble Chriſtian Philoſopher <hi>Boetius</hi> hath well obſerved;<note place="margin">

For when I ſee any outward Object, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be a Man, or Horſe, or Bird, the outward Object does not treat in my Eye, nor yet in my Mind the Idea of thoſe Things; for the outward Object does nothing but imprint in our ſenſible Organs a Corporeal Motion. Now there is nothing in a corporeal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that can form in us the Ideas of thoſe Things;<note place="margin">The Motions of the Body and Mind diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed.</note> for all Ideas are of a ſpiritual Nature: Now nothing that is corporeal can produce that which is ſpiritual, becauſe <hi>The leſs Excellent cannot produce the more Excellent,</hi> elſe the Effect would exceed its Cauſe; which is againſt all ſound Reaſon, that it ſhould bring forth what were of a higher and more excellent Kind. Therefore all Ideas, whether of natural or ſpiritual Things, are <hi>divinely implanted</hi> in our Minds; which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs do not always appear, but ſometimes appear, and ſometimes are as it were hid in us, and ſometimes are ſtirred up in us by Cauſes outward or inward, and again do as it were ſleep and ſhun our Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and ſeem not to be otherways diſtinguiſhed by our Minds, but as Thoughts and Perceptions of the Mind from the Mind it ſelf; that is, as the Mode from the Subject, or as a bodily Motion from the Body, whereof it is the Motion: <hi>For as is the Relation of a bodily Motion to a Body, ſo is the Relation of a Thought or Perception of the Mind to the Mind.</hi> In this nevertheleſs they differ, that the <hi>Mind</hi> can move it ſelf, and operate in it ſelf; which a Body cannot do: But as a <hi>Body</hi> can be moved by another, ſo alſo can the <hi>Mind</hi> after its Manner be moved by another, and that both by outward and inward Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but chiefly by God himſelf, in whoſe Hand all Souls and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are.

                  <p>Now if there be ſuch ſupernatural Ideas, there are alſo Senſes, or perceptive Faculties by which thoſe Ideas are perceived; for thoſe are two Relatives that ſuppoſe and infer one another, but in wicked Men thoſe Senſes or Faculties do as it were ſleep (as the viſive Faculty of a blind Man) but in the Godly they are ſtirred up. Now by theſe divine and ſpiritual Senſes, which are diſtinct and diſtinguiſhable from all the natural Faculties of the Soul, whether of Imagination, or natural Reaſon, ſpiritual-minded Men do behold the Glory and Beauty of GOD,<note place="margin">The Beauty of God makes the Glory of this World deſpicable.</note> in Reſpect whereof, and for which all the Glory of this World is deſpicable to them; yea, even as Droſs and Dung.

And albeit either the Imagination of Man, or Subtilty of the Devil, may counterfeit falſe Likeneſſes of theſe Enjoyments, by which Men may be deceived, and no Doubt many are deceived; that doth not hinder, but that thoſe divine Enjoyments are clearly perceived in ſuch, in whom the divine and ſpiritual Senſes are truly opened, and the true ſupernatural Ideas of thoſe Things truly raiſed up.<note place="margin">The Cauſe of <hi>Miſtakes</hi> by falſe <hi>Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi>

                  <p>But to proceed: If we will hear the <hi>Scripture</hi> (as all Chriſtians ought) it teſtifies to us,<note place="margin">God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his Will even in <hi>contingent Truths</hi> in the Scripture.</note> that GOD hath declared his Mind and Will even concerning <hi>contingent Truths to come,</hi> in the Prophets; as that of the firſt to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> doth evidently declare: <hi>GOD, who at ſundry Times, and in divers Manners ſpoke to our Fathers in the Prophets.</hi> Yea, let us hear the Prophets themſelves, <hi>Hoſea,</hi> Chap. i. ſaith plainly, <hi>That the Word of the LORD was made in him</hi> (as it is in the,<hi>Heb.)

                        <hi>Revelations</hi> were in the Minds of the Prophets by inward Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</note> And it is ſo manifeſt, that the moſt <hi>heavenly Revelations</hi> are by <hi>inward Illuſtrations</hi> and <hi>Inſpirations</hi> in the very Minds of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; that it is ſtrange how any that believes the Scripture ſhould doubt of it. And if it happened at any Time, ſuch Revelations were made in the natural Imaginations of the Prophets, or any of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward natural Senſes; then it may be confeſſed, they could not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly certain, they came from <hi>GOD,</hi> unleſs they alſo felt God in the <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Supernatural Senſes,</hi> by which they did moſt nearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to him, from theſe ſuperior and moſt inward Senſes working upon the lower and leſs noble Faculties of the Mind.

For <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> did no Miracle; and many propheſied, where there apppear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no Miracle, as in the Scripture may be often obſerved. And we alſo by the <hi>Inſpiration of the ſame divine Spirit,</hi> by which the Prophets propheſied, do believe their Words and Writings to be <hi>divine</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning contingent Truths, as well paſt as to come; elſe that Faith, by which we believe the Scripture, would not be <hi>divine,</hi> but <hi>meerly hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane.</hi> And thence we need no outward Miracles to move us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Scriptures; and therefore much leſs were they neceſſary to the Prophets who writ them. For we ſee in many Places of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
<pb n="526" facs="unknown:003104_0537_0FEFF807F8377AC0"/>
where they declare Prophecies as revealed to them of <hi>GOD,</hi> there is not a Word mentioned of any outward Miracle, as that by which alone they were certain of it. Moreover, the Falſeneſs of this Argument doth appear, in that the Scripture doth declare many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent Truths to have been revealed to the Prophets in Dreams:<note place="margin">Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations by Dreams.</note> Now as natural and wicked Men do not ſee what they dream by a real Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the outward Senſes, but by inward Ideas which are preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Mind, and perceived by it; ſo it is alſo in <hi>divine Revelations</hi> of this Nature. Of which we have a clear Example in <hi>Joſeph,</hi> the Husband of the bleſſed Virgin, who, when he obſerved his Wife with Child, was told in a Dream, That ſhe had conceived by the Holy Ghoſt: Now I would know, to which of <hi>Joſeph's outward Senſes</hi> was this revealed? Or what Miracle had he to induce him to believe? Which could neither be proved, (ſo as to make an infallible Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to <hi>Mary</hi>) by the Teſtimony of the Scripture; and which being againſt the Order of Nature, did choak his Reaſon. The Scripture mentions no Miracle in this Matter; and yet no doubt <hi>Joſeph</hi> had highly ſinned had he not believed this Revelation, and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rejected his Wife as an Adultereſs. But if thou ſay'ſt, That ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> there muſt have been a Miracle; that is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to beg the Queſtion: And how falſe this <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> is, the Apoſtle ſhews clearly,<note place="margin">The outward Senſes cannot diſcern the Things of God, for they are ſpiritual.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ii. 14. <hi>The natural or animal Man knoweth not, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth not the Things of GOD.</hi> Now <hi>divine Revelations</hi> are of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and if either chiefly or only thoſe Things were to be judged by the outward Senſes, it would contradict the Apoſtle. For <hi>natural Men</hi> yea, the <hi>moſt Wicked</hi> have the Uſe of the outward Senſes as true and exact as the <hi>moſt Godly.</hi> And whereas the Apoſtle adds, <hi>For they are ſpiritually diſcerned,</hi> it puts the Matter out of all Queſtion: For thence it abundantly appears, that this Diſcerning is not by the outward Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, according to the following Verſe; for the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Man judgeth all Things:</hi> This then muſt be done by ſome Senſes or Properties peculiar to the ſpiritual Man, and in which he excels the natural Man, which is not in the outward Senſes (as all do know) Therefore the Perception of <hi>ſpiritual Things cannot be by the outward Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, either as the chief or only Means,</hi> as is fals;ly contended for.</p>
                  <p>Now as to theſe Words of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Whether Faith comes by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note>

For if thou acknowledge Faith can be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten any otherwiſe than by Hearing, thou loſeſt the Strength of thy Argument: And if that Argument hold, <hi>That Faith comes only by outward Hearing,</hi> thou deſtroyeſt the whole <hi>Hypotheſis.</hi> For having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore affirmed, <hi>That outward Miracles are ſufficient to render one certain of

                  <p>But I the more wonder thy uſing of this Argument, conſidering the Diſcourſe we had together before we entred upon this Debate: For when we were ſpeaking of the Opinion of a certain Perſon,<note place="margin">A certain Perſon pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Thing in the outward Senſes.</note> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the Certainty of every Thing, but what was diſcerned by the outward Senſes, thou condemnedſt it as moſt abſurd; But <hi>why</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive, ſince there is no great Difference betwixt thoſe two Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions: The one ſaith, <hi>There can be no great Certainty concerning any Truths, whether they be</hi> neceſſary, <hi>or</hi> contingent, <hi>but by the Perception of the Senſes:</hi> The other affirms the ſame of contingent Truths, tho' not of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Truths. But among the Number of contingent Truths, thou eſteemeſt what belongs to Chriſtian Religion; for thou reckons the neceſſary Truths only to belong to natural Religion. This then is all the Difference, that that other Perſon ſays, There is no Certainty of any Religion, neither natural nor Chriſtian, but by the Perception of the outward Senſes: But thou ſay'ſt, Tho' thou eſteemeſt the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of natural Religion to be without them, yet not of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion. But again, ſince thou eſteemeſt, that not natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but the Chriſtian Religion is neceſſary to Salvation; thou muſt neceſſarily conclude, That thoſe Truths which are neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, are only known and believed by the Benefit of the outward Senſes: In which Concluſion (which is the Sum af all) thou yieldeſt the Matter to that other Perſon.</p>
                  <p>But laſtly: If all the Certainty of our <hi>Faith,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Outward Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</note> 
                     <hi>Hope,</hi> and <hi>Salvation</hi> did depend upon the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of <hi>outward Senſes,</hi> we ſhould be moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable; ſince theſe Senſes can be eaſily deceived, and by many out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Caſualties, and natural Infirmities, whereunto the Godly are no leſs ſubject than the Wicked, are often vitiated; and there are (as the Scripture affirms,) <hi>falſe Miracles,</hi> which, as to the outward, cannot be diſtinguiſhed from the true; of which we cannot infallibly judge by the outward Senſes, which only diſcern what is outward,</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Now this he endeavours to prove, both from ſome other Principles of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſo called, and from <hi>R. B</hi>'s ſixth <hi>Theſis,</hi> after this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That,</hi> ſaid the Ambaſſador, <hi>is the principal Rule and Foundation of our Faith, which is the only</hi> Medium <hi>or</hi> Mean, <hi>whereby that Hiſtorical Knowledge and Faith are brought unto us: But, according to the</hi> Quakers, <hi>and the ſixth</hi> Theſis, <hi>the Scripture is the only</hi> Medium <hi>or</hi> Mean, <hi>whereby that Hiſtorical Knowledge and Faith are brought unto us: Therefore, according to the</hi> Quakers, <hi>and the ſixth</hi> Theſis, <hi>the Scripture is the Principal Rule and Foundation of our Faith.</hi>
                        </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>For the clearer underſtanding the Solution of this Argument, ſome Things worthy Obſervation are to be conſidered.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt</hi> then obſerve, that the Force of this Argument at moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to prove this, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Scripture is the Principal Rule and Foundation of Hiſtorical Faith and Knowledge; but we with good Reaſon diſtinguiſh between <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> and <hi>Saving Knowledge,</hi> and between <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> and <hi>Saving Faith;</hi> becauſe many may have an <hi>Hiſtorical Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Faith,</hi> who have not that which is <hi>Saving.</hi> Yea, it is poſſible, that a Man, by the inward Revelation of the Holy Spirit, may have an <hi>Hiſtorical Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> who yet may not have that Faith which is <hi>Saving;</hi> becauſe <hi>Saving Faith</hi> hath regard to God, not preciſely, as revealing ſome outward Hiſtory concerning God and Chriſt, but as Revealing very <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> by his Grace, Goodneſs, Mercy, and
<pb n="529" facs="unknown:003104_0540_0FEFF84F900DB9D8"/>
Power, ready and willing to ſave us, according to his unſpeakable Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will towards us; by which <hi>Saving Faith</hi> we reſt upon God thro' <hi>Chriſt, our Light and Life,</hi> as upon our moſt merciful Father; which Faith can neither exiſt, nor be conceived without Love to God, Humility be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, Denial and Diſſidence of Self; and therefore ſuch a Faith is <hi>Saving.</hi> But <hi>Hiſtorical Faith,</hi> tho' wrought in the Hearts of Men by the inward Revelation and Operation of the Holy Spirit, may be without that Divine Love, Humility and Self-denial: Wherefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely conſidered in its own Nature, it is not <hi>Saving.</hi> 'Twas this kind of Knowledge and Faith which wicked <hi>Balaam</hi> had, who ſaw and knew many Hiſtorical Futurities, and believed them, but had not <hi>Saving Faith.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. Obſerve, <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Knowledge and Faith neceſſary to Salvation are to be underſtood two Ways, either by a <hi>Neceſſity Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> or <hi>in Way of Priority,</hi> or by a <hi>Neceſſity Conſequent</hi> or <hi>in Way of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriority.

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent Life, and lead a new one for the Time to come; that God hears the Prayers of thoſe that are truly humble and ſuppliant; that he is a glorious Rewarder of all that live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly; that he is a moſt juſt Avenger againſt all thoſe who deſpiſe his Grace and Love, and repent not of their Sins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which, in ſome Degree, are to all Men, even to thoſe who are deſtitute of the Scriptures, reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by that inward <hi>Evangelical Light,</hi> which <hi>enlightens all Men. Neceſſity Conſequent</hi> or <hi>in Way of Poſteriority,</hi> is, when ſomething is not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary to our Salvation, but after a certain Sort, or under ſome Reſpect, Condition and Limitation; of which Kind are thoſe Things which are not revealed, becauſe they are neceſſary; but becauſe they are revealed, they are neceſſary to be believed by us: For Example; if God ſhould reveal to any Man, that it was his Will and Command, he ſhould go to <hi>Rome</hi> to reprove Tyranny and Superſtition; certainly this Revelation were neceſſary to be believed to that Man's Salvation, by a <hi>Neceſſity Conſequent,</hi> becauſe that Faith is an Act of Obedience; and to obey God is neceſſary to Salvation.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Obſerve in the Third Place, That among thoſe Things that are neceſſary to be believed to Salvation by a <hi>Neceſſity Conſequent,</hi> there are ſome Things, tho' not abſolutely neceſſary, yet are they very profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and conducive Means to our Salvation; of which Sort are the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical Knowledge and Faith concerning God, the Creation and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the World, Chriſt's taking Fleſh, and dying therein for our Sins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whether that <hi>Hiſtorical Knowledge</hi> come to us, either by the ſole inward Revelation of the Holy Spirit, without the <hi>Medium</hi> or <hi>Mean</hi> of Scripture, or alſo by both, to wit, both by the inward Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Holy Spirit, and by the Scriptures; which two <hi>Mediums</hi> or <hi>Means</hi> do ſometimes concur in producing in Men <hi>Hiſtorical Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> concerning God and Chriſt, as is ſaid before, but in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Manner. The outward Revelation (as 'tis called) of Scripture is a <hi>Medium</hi> or <hi>Mean,</hi> by Way of <hi>Material Object,</hi> in producing that <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical Knowledge and Faith:</hi> But the inward Inſpiration and Revelation wrought in the Hearts of Men by the Holy Spirit, are a <hi>Medium</hi> or <hi>Mean</hi> by way of <hi>Formal Object,</hi> in producing the ſame <hi>Hiſtorical Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>

and <hi>Faith.</hi> By the <hi>Material Object,</hi> we underſtand that which is believed; and therefore the Scriptures, which are believed, are the <hi>Material Object</hi> of <hi>Hiſtorical Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Faith.</hi> By the <hi>Formal Object,</hi> we underſtand the principal Motive <hi>in reſpect of the Object, for which</hi> the Scriptures are believed. But the Principal Motive <hi>in reſpect of the Object</hi> is not the Scripture it ſelf, but that inward Teſtimony of the Holy Spirit, which when we hear or read the Scriptures (when it pleaſeth the moſt good and great God to inſpire the Hearts of Men) works an Aſſent in us, whether it inclines us to aſſent to the Hiſtorical Truths hitherto declared in the Scriptures or no: Wherefore we do not affirm that the Holy Spirit doth ordinarily and commonly ſpeak in us ſomething that is <hi>New,</hi> or declare to our inward Hearing thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Hiſtories of God and Chriſt (tho' God may, if he ſhall pleaſe, do it at this Day;) but we ſay, that God doth by his Holy Spirit, thro' his ſenſible and perceptible Motions and Operations Objectively repreſenting themſelves, move and incline us to aſſent unto and believe the Scriptures and the Hiſtorical Truths declared of in the Scriptures.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Things conſider'd, we affirm, that tho' the Scriptures are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily and commonly a certain <hi>Medium</hi> or <hi>Mean</hi> by way of <hi>Material Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> or Condition, for the producing of <hi>Hiſtorical Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> in us, and that, commonly ſpeaking, a neceſſary <hi>Mean</hi> too, as being that without which God doth not ordinarily reveal the outward Hiſtory of God and Chriſt; yet we utterly deny that in true Chriſtians, the Scripture or outward Hiſtory in the Scriptures, is the Principal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, Foundation or Principal Rule of that <hi>Hiſtorical Faith,</hi> much leſs of <hi>Saving Faith,</hi> to the Producing of which the Letter of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth very frequently (as to many of its Acts, if not all) not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur or co-operate, either as a <hi>Material Object,</hi> or as a neceſſary Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is wont commonly to be called in the <hi>Schools, Cauſa ſine qua non,</hi> or a Cauſe or Condition without which a Thing cannot be done, tho' it doth not influence the Effect.</p>
                        <p>Now for a direct Solution of the Argument aforeſaid, We anſwer, that the <hi>Hiſtorical Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> concerning Chriſt's being Born, Dead, Buried, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to us <hi>Europeans,</hi> who have the Scriptures, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation, that is to ſay, by a <hi>Neceſſity Conſequent,</hi> or in <hi>Way of Poſteriority,</hi> (as was before explained) which Aſſertion of ours ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs militates not againſt the <hi>Sixth Theſis,</hi> which granteth, that that <hi>Hiſtorical Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> are impoſſible to thoſe who live in thoſe Corners of the World, where the Knowledge of the Hiſtory is wanting; which Impoſſibility is not abſolutely to be underſtood, but after a Sort, and in ſome Reſpect; becauſe without Doubt God doth ordinarily communicate that Hiſtorical Knowledge unto Men, by the <hi>Medium</hi> or <hi>Mean</hi> of the Scriptures; yet not as by the Principal <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> or <hi>Mean,</hi> much leſs as by the <hi>only</hi> one: Becauſe certainly that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Motion of the Holy Spirit wrought in our Hearts, moving and inclining us <hi>Objectively</hi> to aſſent unto and believe the Scriptures, is the Principal Motive <hi>in reſpect of the Object, for which</hi> we believe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and therefore is the Foundation and Principal Rule of our <hi>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Faith</hi> alſo.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore we anſwer unto the <hi>Minor Propoſition</hi> of the laſt <hi>Syllogiſm,</hi> by plainly and directly denying that <hi>Minor Propoſition, viz.</hi> That the Scriptures are the only <hi>Medium</hi> or <hi>Mean</hi> for attaining to the Knowledge of the Hiſtory: They are indeed one certain <hi>Medium</hi> or <hi>Mean,</hi> and that neceſſary; but they are not the <hi>only</hi> nor principal. An Example for the Illuſtration hereof occurs in Natural and Outward Viſion: For when I ſee a white or red Roſe, that white or red Roſe is the <hi>Material Object</hi>
                           <pb n="531" facs="unknown:003104_0542_0FEFF851E64A0080"/>
of my Sight, and one neceſſary <hi>Medium</hi> for the producing of that Sight; yet that Roſe is not the only <hi>Medium</hi> or <hi>Mean;</hi> for the Light is another, no leſs neceſſary, concurring to produce my Sight, by way of <hi>Formal Object,</hi> by Means of which I ſee that Roſe repreſented under ſuch or ſuch a Colour and Figure. Moreover, in that he aſſerts, <hi>Theſe inward Motions wrought by the Holy Spirit in the Hearts of Believers, are ſo undiſcernible by us, that Believers cannot clearly and infallibly diſtinguiſh them from their own private and proper Motions:</hi> This he ſuppoſes, but proves not. And therein he is deceived, either thro' his Inexperience, or Want of that due Waiting, and Attention to thoſe Motions in the Divine Illumination of Chriſt, wherewith he hath enlightened both him [the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi>] and all Men coming into the World. But our Experience, together with the Experience of the Holy Prophets and Apoſtles, is a ſtronger Motive to induce us to believe, that Divine, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Revelation is ſufficiently clear and convincing by its own Light and Evidence, than his own bare and jejune Suppoſition to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, by reaſon of his Want of Experience or Attention.</p>
                        <p>As to the <hi>Latin,</hi> we have not been very curious in this Writing, by reaſon of Haſte; yet have briefly anſwered the Argument as a Friend communicated it to us by Letter; if he hath omitted any Thing in his Tranſmiſſion, or we may ſeem not to have underſtood or touch'd the Strength of the Argument, let it be remitted to us; and we, thro' Divine Aſſiſtance, ſhall anſwer it at large.</p>

                        <p>The Solution of this Argument is eaſie; for Evidence is three-fold.</p>
                        <p>The Firſt is <hi>the Evidence of Things ſenſible,</hi> appertaining to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Senſes.</p>
                        <p>The Second is <hi>the Evidence of things intellectual, but Natural,</hi> apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to Natural Reaſon.</p>
                        <p>The Third is <hi>the Evidence of Things Spiritual and Supernatural,</hi> as they are propoſed to the Underſtanding, by the inward Illumination and Revelation of the Holy Spirit.</p>
                        <p>The firſt Evidence may be called <hi>the Evidence of Senſe,</hi> or <hi>Animal Evidence.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Second, <hi>the Evidence of Reaſon,</hi> or <hi>Rational Evidence.</hi>

                           <pb n="532" facs="unknown:003104_0543_0FEFF810CA393BB8"/>The Third, <hi>the Evidence of Faith,</hi> or <hi>Spiritual Evidence.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But Faith is the Evidence of Things not ſeen, <hi>that is,</hi> neither viſible by the outward Senſes, or by natural Reaſon; yet theſe Things hinder not, but that Faith may be the Evidence of Things not ſeen by the Underſtanding of a Man, not as operating in its own natural Way, but as Divinely elevated and aſſiſted by the inward Illumination and Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Holy Spirit. Wherefore, tho' Things appertaining to Faith may be very obſcure, and as it were mere Darkneſs, both to the outward Senſes, and natural Reaſon; yet they have their Evidence if duly propoſed to an Underſtanding Divinely inlightned. Is it not ſaid in the ſame Chapter to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> concerning <hi>Moſes,</hi> that by <hi>Faith he ſaw God?</hi> That is to ſay, not by the <hi>outward Eye,</hi> nor by <hi>the Eye of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reaſon;</hi> but by the <hi>Eye of Faith.</hi>

               </note> This Correſpondence gave Occaſion to <hi>W. Penn</hi> and <hi>R. Barclay</hi> to paſs towards <hi>Herford,</hi> a Town on the Frontiers of <hi>Paderborn,</hi> and to give the ſaid Princeſs, who reſided there, a Viſit. With her lived <hi>Anna Maria,</hi> Counteſs of <hi>Hornes;</hi> and in one of the Chambers of the Princeſs, <hi>W. P.</hi> and <hi>R. B.</hi> had a Meeting with the Princeſs, the Counteſs, and ſeveral others to their great Satisfaction. And the Counteſs who was one of <hi>Labadie</hi>'s Adherents, ſignified to <hi>W. Penn,</hi> that ſhe wiſh'd a Meeting might be had where the inferior Servants might freely appear. <hi>W. Penn</hi> not refuſing this, the Princeſs conſented to it; and after the Meeting, (where ſhe was not herſelf, that ſo her Servants might have a more free Acceſs) ſhe expreſt much Satisfaction in having had that good Opportunity. And then ſo earneſtly invited <hi>W. Penn</hi> and <hi>R. Barclay,</hi> (who lodged at an Inn) to ſup with her, that they not being well able to refuſe the Invitation, yielded to it. There was then with her a <hi>French</hi> Woman of Quality, who having had before a very ſlight Opinion of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came deeply broken, and very affectionately kind and reſpectful to <hi>W.

Penn</hi> deſired that not only as many of her own Family, but as many of the Town as would willingly be there, might be admitted. To this ſhe yielded. And thus <hi>W. Penn</hi> and <hi>R. Barclay</hi> had a large Opportunity to preach effectually, and to diſcharge themſelves. After the Meeting was done, the Princeſs came to <hi>W. Penn,</hi> and taking him by the Hand, ſhe ſpoke to him of the Senſe ſhe had of the Power and Preſence of God that had been among them; and thus going on ſhe broke forth into an extraordinary Paſſion, crying out,<note place="margin">Afterwards take their ſolemn Leave, and <hi>Barclay</hi> returns to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> while <hi>Penn</hi> goes to <hi>Pader<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn, Caſſel</hi> &amp; <hi>Frankford,</hi> where he has a Meeting at the Houſe of <hi>J.

               <hi>I cannot ſpeak to you, my Heart is full,</hi> clapping her Hand upon her Breaſt. This affected <hi>W.

Pray call here as ye return out of</hi> Germany. To this he returned, <hi>We are in the Hand of the Lord, and being at his Pleaſure, cannot ſo fully diſpoſe of our ſelves.</hi> Solemn Leave then being taken, <hi>R. Barclay</hi> returned to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and <hi>W. Penn</hi> went to <hi>Paderborn,</hi> and ſo by the Way of <hi>Caſſel</hi> (where he ſpoke with the Aged and Learned <hi>Dureus</hi>) to <hi>Frankfort.</hi> Here he found ſeveral Perſons of Note, with whom he had ſeveral Times a Meeting, and once at the Houſe of a young Gentlewoman, noble of Birth, called <hi>Johanna Eleonora Merlane,</hi> who ſaid to him, <hi>Our Quarters are free for you, let all come that will come, and lift up your Voices without Fear.</hi>

Being much preſs'd by the Princeſs to ſtay and ſup with her, he yielded: And the Counteſs from a ſerious Senſe of her Compliance with the World, told him, <hi>Il faut que je rompe, il faut que je rompe,</hi> i. e. <hi>I muſt break off, I muſt break off.</hi> And at another Time with a weighty Countenance ſhe cry'd out, <hi>O the Cumber and Entanglements of this vain World! They hinder all Good.</hi> Once the Princeſs ſaid to him, <hi>It is a hard Matter to be faithful to what one knows. I fear that I am not weighty enough in my Spirit.</hi> At another Time ſhe told him, <hi>Among my Books I have Records that the Goſpel was by the</hi> Engliſh <hi>firſt brought from</hi> England <hi>into</hi> Germany; <hi>and now it is come again.</hi> Thus this excellent Princeſs ſignified how highly ſhe valued the Preaching of the Goſpel to her by <hi>W.

When he took his Leave of theſe eminent Perſons, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken the Princeſs by the Hand, which ſhe received with a weighty Kindneſs, being much broken in Spirit, he wiſh'd <hi>the Bleſſing and Peace of Jeſus with and upon her:</hi> And then exhorting the Counteſs, ſhe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently beſeeched him, <hi>to remember her, and implore the Lord on her Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.</hi>

I well know that therein they wronged him.

               </gap>ed. Of ſeveral other true Prophets we find not the leaſt Mention of any Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles they did;<note place="margin">Deut. xiii. 1, 2.</note> but on the contrary the Scriptures ſignify, that poſſibly falſe Prophets might ariſe and give Signs or Wonders; and that the doing of Miracles could not always be a Proof or ſure Evidence that any one was ſent of God, appears plainly from what our Saviour himſelf ſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> that among thoſe to whom he ſhould one Day ſay,<note place="margin">Mat. vii. 22.</note> 
               <hi>Depart from me,</hi> would be ſuch that ſhould ſay, <hi>Have we not in thy Name caſt out Devils, and in thy Name done many wonderful Works?</hi> And what ſhall we think of the Sorcerers of <hi>Egypt?</hi> Did not they ſeem to do the ſame Wonders as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> did? And yet thoſe Wonders wherewithal they deceived <hi>Pharoah</hi> and his Men, were in no wiſe wrought by a divine Power. Now ſince it appears plainly from the holy Scriptures, and Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſaid,<note place="margin">Mat. xxiv. 24.</note> 
               <hi>There ſhall ariſe falſe Prophets, and ſhall ſhew great Signs and Wonders,</hi> we might with good Reaſon ſuſpect the Doctrine of one, who now-a-days wrought Miracles, on purpoſe to make what he denounced to paſs for Truth. This being duly conſidered, it ſeems to be very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, to require Miracles again for Confirmation of the ſame Goſpel which once hath been confirmed by Miracles, and to deſire that the Truth of what once hath been declared by the Apoſtles, and ſtrengthned by wonderful Works, ſhould be ſealed a-new with outward Wonders. But it would indeed have been another Caſe, if a new Goſpel was preached, and that any pretended to give forth new holy Scriptures; for then it might be ſaid with ſome Reaſon, that it was neceſſary that this new Goſpel ſhould be made credible, and confirmed by viſible Miracles. But where no other Goſpel is preached, than what hath been once delivered to the Chriſtians by the firſt Promulgators of the Chriſtian Religion, and where this is not done amongſt Heathens, but amongſt Chriſtians, or at leaſt ſuch as bear the Name, there it cannot in Juſtice be required to confirm this Doctrine once more with Miracles; the rather becauſe, as hath been ſhewed already, the doing of Miracles may not always paſs for an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragable Proof of One's being really pious and godly. To this may be added, that the Miracles which Chriſt and his Apoſtles wrought to give Credit to the Appearing of the Son of God in the Fleſh, may be conſidered as Types and Figures of thoſe ſpiritual Wonders which ſhould be wrought in the Souls of People, when Chriſt was to be ſeen the ſecond Time, and to appear by his Spirit, to the Salvation of thoſe who wait for him; for the Eyes of the Mind being blinded, muſt be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened and enlightened by him; and many that are dead in Sin and Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, ſhall by him be raiſed, and made alive. This I think may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to ſhew, that the Poſition of Dr.<hi>Galenus</hi> could not ſtand the Teſt: But whatever was objected, he continued to maintain his Opinion.</p>

                  <p>Did not Chriſt anſwer ſome that deſired Fire might come down from Heaven and con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſume thoſe that would not receive him; <hi>Ye know not what manner of Spirit ye are of?</hi> Did not he rebuke them, ſaying that he <hi>came not to deſtroy Mens Lives, but to ſave them?</hi> Luke ix 54, 55, 56.</p>
                  <p>Ye therefore who have deſtroyed ſuch a vaſt Number of Men and Women for their Diſſenting from you about <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and taken away their Lives by ſuch kind of Inſtruments, Racks and Fires, as were never sent down from Heaven, but deviſed and invented by your ſelves; Are ye not worſe than they, who deſired Fire to he called from Heaven to deſtroy Mens Lives? And ſeeing Chriſt told them, that they knew not what manner of Spirit they were of, do ye know what manner of Spirit ye are of, who have deviſed ſo many Ways and Torments for the killing of Men, and havc actually made uſe of them.</p>
                  <p>With what Front ran ye perſuade us to commit our Souls Bodies, and Lives to you, who know not of what Spirit ye are Children, neither have the Mind of Chriſt, who ſaid, He came not to deſtroy Mens Lives, but to ſave them</p>
                  <p>Are ye not all, therefore, as many as take away Mem Lives for Worſhip deviſed by you, obnoxious to the Rebuke of Chriſt? For when did Chriſt or any of his Apoſtles ever give Command, or by their Example teach, that any one that was diſobedient to them, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected their Doctrine and Rellgion, ſhould be perſecuted and impriſoned, or puniſhed by any Carnal Weapons? Tell as where any thing of this Kind is contained, either in the four Evangelical Hiſtories, or in the Epiſtles written to the Chriſtian Churches?</p>
                  <p>Did ever Chriſt or his Apoſtles go to the Rope-makers to buy Whips and Halters, to whip and hang Men for diſſenting from them, as ye have done? Did they ever go to the Blackſmiths to make Chains, Fetters, Bolts and Locks? Or to the Gunſmiths to buy Guns and Musket? or to the Sword-cutlers, to buy Swords or Halberts? Did they ever build Priſons, or get Holes and Vaults dug, to ſorce Men by ſuch Means to their Religion? Shew us an Example and Precept given by Chriſt or his Apoſtles, which commands and makes the Uſe of ſuch Weapons and Inſtruments lawful.</p>

So Night being come, he ſent them to the jail. About a Month after, at the Quarter-Seſſions, they
<pb n="549" facs="unknown:003104_0560_0FEFF869CE31CDE8"/>

The Recorder then asked, <hi>What King's Reign was that in? In King</hi> Henry VII's. replied <hi>G. Whitehead. I perceive you are read,</hi> returned the Recorder. And ſo he was indeed; and he defended his Cauſe ſo well in the Court, that the Magiſtrates ſeemed at a Loſs; for he ſhewed ſo evidently that he was unjuſtly committed to Priſon, that the Mayor (to whom, and to the Juſtices he had appealed) ſaid, <hi>You have appealed to me; truly we are Tradeſmen, and no Lawyers: We leave Matters of Law to the Recorder; he knows the Law, and we muſt acquieſce in his Judgement.</hi> If I ſhould repeat here all that was ſpoken <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>contra,</hi> ſo as I find it extant, I ſhould be fain to be almoſt as large as I have been in the Relation of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of <hi>John Crook</hi> and <hi>William Penn:</hi> And therefore I'll only ſay brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that after much Reaſoning, the Recorder tendered the Oath of Allegiance again to them, that ſo by their Refuſal he might get Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to premunire them. But this Recorder, before the whole Proceſs came to an End, being turned out by the Magiſtrates, it did not come to that Pitch; tho' it was a good while yet before the aforeſaid <hi>G.

               </note> and on his dying Bed he declared that he had a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God, and he gave Marks of a true Chriſtian Diſpoſition of Mind: He alſo gave his Son ſeveral wholeſome Admonitions how to behave himſelf in this World.

            <p>I left <hi>G. Fox</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> and ſince he continued there and thereabout a good while, I'll take a Turn to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> where in the Year 1682,<note place="margin">

               </note> a diſmal Scene of Perſecution was opened: For the Meetings of thoſe called <hi>Quakers</hi> were diſturbed, not only by grievouſly abuſing, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoning them; but they were alſo vex'd by breaking into their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and committing all manner of Violence, as among the reſt in the Houſe of <hi>Richard Marſh,</hi>

the Goods thus taken, were ſold for leſs than the half, becauſe honeſt People being unwilling to buy ſuch Goods, they were ſold to any one that would but bid ſome Money, how little ſoever: For what was wanting of the Fine was taken a-new from the fined Perſon, and ſo they did here alſo; for they broke open his Compting-houſe, ſought for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and took away his Leidger, Journal, Caſh-book, and other Books and Accounts, beſides many Houſhold-Goods; and ſeveral Chambers were rifled, tho' the Wife of the ſaid <hi>Marſh</hi> lay in Child-bed at that Time.<note place="margin">And carried on chiefly by She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff <hi>Knight, J Helliar</hi> an Attorney, with their Accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>Lugg, Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, Caſſe, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick, Hoar, Watkins,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers.</note> The chief Actors of theſe Inſolencies were the Sheriff <hi>John Knight,</hi> and <hi>John Helliar</hi> an Attorney, who with his Companions <hi>Lugg, Tilley, Caſſe, Patrick, Hoar</hi> and <hi>Watkins,</hi> ſerved for Informers. <hi>Knight</hi> and <hi>Helliar</hi> came frequently with a Multitude of Boys and rude Rabble, to diſturb the Meetings of the <hi>Quakers;</hi> and then they carried them to the Priſons, which grew ſo full, that about fifty Perſons were crouded into one Room, which was ſo naſty, that one of the Aldermen, <hi>viz.</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Cann</hi> ſaid, <hi>If he had a Dog which he loved, he would not put him there.</hi> And tho' Sir <hi>Thomas Earl,</hi> Mayor of the City, and ſome Juſtices and Aldermen, at the Requeſt of others, ſhewed themſelves inclined to allow the Priſoners a better Place, yet the Power of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid Sheriff <hi>John Knight</hi> was ſuch, that he hindred it.</p>
            <p>The Meetings of other Proteſtant Diſſenters were diſturbed now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, but they fainted and gave way;<note place="margin">Other Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters diſturbed, but give way.</note> whereas the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſtood firm, how much ſoever vexed; which often was done in a very outragious Manner: For their Meetings were not only diſturbed often with the Noiſe of Drums and Fiddles, but Liberty was given to the vileſt Fellows to commit all kind of Inſolency, without ſhewing any Regard to thoſe of the Female Sex, whoſe Hoods and Scarffs were torn; and <hi>Helliar,</hi> to give the Boys a Sign to attack the Women,<note place="margin">Vile Practices of <hi>Helliar.</hi>
               </note> was us'd to ſay to theſe, <hi>Have a Care of your Hoods and Scarffs;</hi> for then the Boys fell upon them; and both aged Women and ancient Men were carried to Priſon, and forced to go faſter than they well could, by puſhing them, and pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Arms black and blue; and when once a Girl ſpoke a Word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Cruelty, ſhe was pull'd by the Hair, and haled to Priſon; nay little Boys were beaten on the Head till they grew giddy, and then they were carried to <hi>Bridewell,</hi> where <hi>Helliar</hi> charged the Keeper <hi>to get a new Cat of nine Tails,</hi> endeavouring to terrify the Children, by making them believe they ſhould be whipt, unleſs they would promiſe to come no more to Meetings: But this ſucceeded not; for his extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Malice did not ſubdue the Conſtancy of theſe Children.</p>
            <p>With ſuch Diabolical Rage they perſecuted this People at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and not a Stone was left unturn'd to afflict them. Once they were nailed up in their Meeting-houſe, and thus kept about ſix hours; which could not but be very hard to Nature, ſince there were alſo Women of no mean Families, and among theſe the Widow of the Upper-Sheriff <hi>Lane.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Jails fill'd.</note> So many alſo were taken Priſoners, that at length there was no more Room in the Jails. By theſe Proceedings many Families were ruined: For their Goods were taken from them, not only on the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Meeting, but when any were believed to be of good Eſtates, the Oath of Allegiance was tendered to them. At Court it ſeems they were the more offended againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> becauſe in the Election of Members of Parliament, ſome had voted for ſuch as they believed to be moderate, and no Favourers of Popery; and therefore it was ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derhand,<note place="margin">'Tis inſinuated, to ſtay perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> if they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear voting for Parliament-Men</note>

her Child by the Hair of his Head, and asking him, <hi>Why he ſo abuſed her Child,</hi> was therefore ill treated herſelf by him. And by Order of the ſaid <hi>Helliar</hi> a Laſs was committed to <hi>Bridewel,</hi> becauſe ſhe gave an impudent Boy, that would have turned up her Coats, a Box on the Ear; for which defending of her Modeſty, this brutiſh <hi>Helliar</hi> called her a Rioter and ſeditious Perſon: For he was, as hath been ſaid already, a Leader of inſolent and ſaucy Boys, which he from Time to Time took along with him to diſturb the Meetings of the <hi>Quakers.</hi>

With <hi>Helliar</hi> it became cuſtomary to call Men Rogues, and the Women Whores, Jades, Carrions, and damn'd Bitches: He alſo bid the Boys to tear their Scarfs, and take up Dirt, and throw it upon them. Of this his Beaſtly Rage there were many Witneſſes; for theſe abominable Dealings diſpleaſed many People of other Perſuaſions: But it ſeems theſe enraged Fellows had Encouragement at Court, whereon they durſt rely: For the Sheriff <hi>John Knight</hi> was knighted,<note place="margin">Theſe Doings encouraged at Court, and Sheriff <hi>Knight</hi> knighted.</note> and thereby grew more inſolent. Once it happened that <hi>Helliar</hi> having diſturbed a Meeting, drove the Women along the Streets as if they had been Cattle; and being asked, <hi>Whether he made Beaſts of them?</hi> He anſwered, <hi>Ye are worſe than Beaſts, for Beaſts will be driven, but you will not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This diſturbing or Meetings continued till almoſt all the Men belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereto were clapt up in Priſon; and ſome of them ſending a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Mayor and Juſtices of the City, that they might be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to let them have larger Rooms, ſince not only their Health, but their Lives alſo were endangered, the ſaid Magiſtrates ſhewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves inclined to allow the Priſoners ſome Eaſe or Enlargement: But the Power of Sheriff <hi>Knight</hi> was ſuch, that whatever they ſaid or did, all proved in vain. The Mayor alſo ſignified to the Sheriff, <q>That he would have all Convictions made above-board, and not in Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes and Taverns; and that he would have the diſtrained Goods brought into a publick Warehouſe, and not in a By-lane.</q>
               <note place="margin">Hereupon he ſlights the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yor, and forces his Compliance.</note> But tho' the Mayor <hi>ex officio</hi> might have commanded the Sheriff, yet this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer was ſo countenanced, that he did not care for whatever the Mayor ſaid; nay, ſo exorbitant was he, that his Adherents began to threaten the Mayor he should not be a Parliament-man; inſomuch that he was forced to comply in ſome Degree.

The Number of the Priſoners for the Sake of their Religion amounted now to one Hundred and fifteen, and ſome of them were confin'd in <hi>Bridewel,</hi>

It is very remarkable that Children under ſixteen Years of Age now performed what their Parents were hindred from: For theſe Children kept up their Religious Meetings as much as was in their Power.<note place="margin">Meetings kept up by Children, of whom <hi>19</hi> are ſent to the Houſe of Correction.</note> But tho' they were not within the Reach of the Law, yet once nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen of theſe Youths were taken and carried to the Houſe of Correction, where they were kept for ſome Time. And tho' they were threatned with Whipping if ever they returned to the Meeting, yet they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued valiant without fainting, altho' they ſuffered exceedingly from the wicked Rabble. But ſo great was their Zeal, that they deſpiſing all Reproach and Inſolence, remained ſtedfaſt; and thus they ſhewed in ſpight of their Enemies, that God would not ſuffer that the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> Meeting ſhould be altogether ſuppreſs'd, as it was intended. This Perſecution continued till the next Year, as it did in ſeveral other Places alſo; for there wanted no Informers, who continually lay in wait for Prey even to ſuch a Degree,<note place="margin">Market-people at their Inn ſworn againſt for a Meeting.</note> that I find that ſome of thoſe called <hi>Quakers,</hi> being come from other Places to a Market, and being gone into an Inn to refreſh themſelves, a ſnatching Informer did not ſtick to declare upon his Oath, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> had kept a Meeting there.</p>

With this the Court ſeemed ſatisfied; and the Biſhop of <hi>Briſtol</hi> ſeeing theſe Apiſh Tricks, told the Court, <hi>That altered it not from being an Oath,</hi> at which they gloried, as having obtained a Conqueſt.

               </note> and by Computation it appeared, that above 700 of thoſe called <hi>Quakers</hi> yet ſuffered Impriſonment in <hi>England.</hi> I could mention ſeveral Inſtances of Perſecution in <hi>Leiceſterſhire, Northamptonſhire,</hi> and elſewhere; but to avoid being prolix, I'll only take a Turn again to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> where Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution continued ſtill: For if ſometimes any of the People called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> came to a Meeting, they preſently were committed to Priſon; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theſe was one <hi>Richard Lindy,</hi> a Blind-man, of about fourſcore and ten Years of Age, who was carried to Jail, and forced to ſit up three Nights in a Chair, tho' others offered to pay for his Lodging, if ſome convenient Place to lie down on had been allowed him. Some of the Priſoners being Tradeſmen, would willingly have work'd in Priſon, to earn ſomething for their Suſtenance; but the Jailor <hi>Iſaac Dennis</hi> would not permit them that Liberty. Other Priſoners fell ſick of the Spotted Fever, and ſome died of it; yet all this did not ſoften the ſaid hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted Jailor. But at length a heavy Stroke from Heaven fell upon him. About the Middle of the Month <hi>October</hi> he fell ſick, and was ſeized with a terrible Anguiſh of Mind. Then he wiſh'd <hi>he had never ſeen the Inſide of the Jail;</hi> and he deſired ſome of the <hi>Quakers, to pray for him, and to forgive him for what he had done.</hi> To which they anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>That they forgave him; but he ſhould ask Forgiveneſs of God.</hi> But ſtill his Anguiſh increaſed; and when the Phyſicians order'd him to be let Blood, he ſaid, <hi>No Phyſick would do him Good, his Diſtemper being ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Thing; and that no Man could do him Good, his Day being over; and there was no Hope of Mercy from God for him.</hi> Some of thoſe called <hi>Quakers</hi> ſeeing him in this woful Condition, ſignified, that <hi>they deſired if it was the Will of the Lord, he might find a Place of Repentance.</hi> And it was told him, <hi>They hoped his Day was not over, becauſe he had ſuch a full Senſe of his Condition:</hi> To which he anſwered, <hi>I thank you for your good Hope; but I have no Faith to believe.</hi> And he further ſaid, <hi>Faith is the Gift of God.</hi> Whatever was ſpoken to him, he continued in ſaying, <hi>That his Day was over, and there was no Mercy for him.</hi> Such a gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Worm is the Guilt of Conſcience; and in this deſperate State he continued above a Month, and died the laſt of <hi>November,</hi> without any viſible Signs of Forgiveneſs; but the Judgment thereof we muſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to God.</p>

To this it was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That if it pleaſed God to call to his Miniſtry Perſons of mean Eſtate, the Church was not warranted to hinder it, and let ſuch ſuffer Want; ſince he, as Sovereign of the Univerſe, could not be limited in the Diſtribution of his Gifts. <hi>Rogers</hi> would continually appeal to the primitive Times, and to give ſome Colour to what they aſſerted, he and his Adherents publiſhed a Paper, with <hi>Edward Burroughs</hi>'s Name to it,<note place="margin">And father on <hi>E Burroughs</hi> what <hi>G.

At length this Rent appeared alſo in <hi>London,</hi> where likewiſe Male-contents were not wanting, who not being ſtrictly conſciencious, would rather live without any Reſtraint; and even ſome that were honeſt, were by fair Words perſuaded to Separation; for among the Separatiſts one <hi>Charles Harris</hi> preached, who was pretty fluent in Speech, and not unelegant in his Expreſſions, as I have ſeen and heard my ſelf. But how ſpecious ſoever the Pretence of theſe Separatiſts was, and whatever Endeavours were made, yet they were not able to continue and ſubſiſt firmly;<note place="margin">At length they differ and come to nothing.</note> but at length they decay'd, and vaniſhed as Snow in the Fields; for the beſt among them came in Time to ſee that they had been deceived; and the leſs honeſt grew worſe; for among themſelves they were not free from Diviſion: And tho' <hi>George Keith</hi> (whoſe Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacy will be mentioned in the Sequel) endeavoured to skulk among them, yet he got no Adherents there. I have often wondered how <hi>Wilkinſon, Harris,</hi> and <hi>Keith</hi> (all which I have known) could apoſtatize to ſuch a Degree as they did: But yet this is not ſo exceeding ſtrange as ſome may think it to be; for we find on Record, that even in the primitive apoſtolical Church was an <hi>Alexander</hi> the Copper-ſmith, and an <hi>Hyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> who made Shipwreck of the Faith, and cauſed a Rent, inſomuch that it is ſaid, <hi>Their Words would eat as did a Canker.</hi>

                        <p>Whereas the late Plot againſt the King, and his Brother the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> &amp;c. is made an Occaſion to perſecute many of us, for our religious Meetings more ſeverely than formerly, we do ſolemnly declare, that 'tis known to the divine Majeſty, and the all-ſeeing Wiſdom whereby Kings reign, and Princes decree Juſtice, that our manifold, extream, and continued Sufferings, being only on a religious Account, have not been the leaſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or Provocation to us to deſire, much leſs to contrive the leaſt Hurt, either to thy Perſon or Government, or to the Perſon of thy Brother the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> &amp;c. we are clear in the Sight of God, Angels, and Men, from all helliſh Plots, and traiterous Conſpiracies, and from all murderous Deſigns and Undertakings againſt the King, his Brother, or any Perſon on Earth whatſoever, being Works of the Devil and Darkneſs; having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarywiſe learned of Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, by his Light and Grace in our Hearts, not ſo much as by Force to defend, much leſs avenge our ſelves from the Injuries done us, but to commit the Cauſe to him that judgeth righteouſly, as peaceable Followers of our Saviour and Redeemer in his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Example and Sufferings, who is the Prince of Peace.</p>
                        <p>O King, we do farther declare, that God Almighty hath taught and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged us to acknowledge, and actually obey Magiſtracy (as his Ordinance)
<pb n="561" facs="unknown:003104_0572_0FEFF87B6D6769C0"/>
in all Things, not repugnant to his Law and Light in our Conſciences, (which is certainly agreeable to the holy Scriptures, and admits not of any immoral or injurious Actions) and that even where, thro' Tenderneſs of Conſcience we cannot conform, it is our Duty patiently to ſuffer, and not to rebel, nor ſeek Revenge; and we hope, by his divine Grace, ever to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean our ſelves, as peaceable minded Chriſtians, in our Converſations un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the civil Government; and as we do ſincerely, and with Reverence, confeſs to divine Power and Providence in thy Reſtoration and Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy Perſon hitherto, ſo our Prayers and Supplications are to the Almighty for thy future Safety and Peace, and that in a thankful Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of God's great Mercies towards thee, thou mayſt be thereby obliged to ſhew Mercy, and relieve the Oppreſs'd from under theſe unmerited Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions and Perſecutions, which a great Number of us thy peaceable Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects do even at this Day ſuffer under in our Perſons and Eſtates, not only by Laws made againſt, but alſo by Laws never intended againſt us; and which is more extream, divers Severities of late have been, and ſtill are inflicted, for which no Colour or Pretence of Law hath been, or can be alledged, ſeveral Jails being ſo filled, as that they want Air, and many innocent Perſons held under extream Diſtreſs, without Regard to Age Sex, or Condition, to the Loſs of ſome Lives already, and apparent Hazard of many more; if not to the endangering Infection in divers Cities and Places in this Nation; and ſo many Houſes, Shops, Barns, and Fields ranſack'd and ſwept of Goods, Corn and Cattle, tending alſo to the great Diſcouragement of Trade and Husbandry, and to the impoveriſhing of a great Number of quiet and induſtrious People, and that for no other Cauſe, but for their religious Worſhip, and Exerciſe of their tender Conſciences to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Almighty God that made them, who is the ſovereign Lord of all, and King in Mens Conſciences.</p>
                        <p>Therefore we humbly intreat thee, O King, in Princely Juſtice, Chriſtian Charity and Compaſſion, to open our Priſon-doors, and take off our Bonds, where the Innocent and Oppreſs'd in thy Land, that fear God, and (in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation) truly honour the King; and ſuffer not the Ruin of ſuch as are quiet in the Land, the Widow and the Fatherleſs for their peaceable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, to lye at the Door of a Prince, profeſſing the tender and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate Religion of Chriſt.</p>

                        <p>On the <hi>Conventicle-Act,</hi> within theſe two Years laſt paſt, many <hi>in and about this City of</hi> London have been extremely oppreſſed, impaired, and ſpoiled in their Eſtates and Trades, upon numerous Convictions and Warrants made againſt them in their <hi>Abſence,</hi> upon the Credit of Informations ſworn by <hi>concealed Informers,</hi> divers of them <hi>impudent Women,</hi> who ſwear for their Profit in Part of the Fines and Seizures, their Husbands being Priſoners for Debt, thro' their own Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. The Warrants commonly made to break open and enter Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which is done with Rigour and great Spoil, not ſparing <hi>Widows, Fatherleſs,</hi> or <hi>poor Families,</hi> who are ſuſtain'd by their daily Care and Induſtry, not leaving them a Bed to reſt upon. The <hi>Fines</hi> upon one Juſtice's Warrants amounting to many <hi>Hundreds of Pounds;</hi> frequently <hi>Ten Pounds</hi> a Warrant, and two Warrants at once for <hi>Twenty Pounds,</hi> executed upon one Perſon; and three Warrants at once from another Juſtice, for <hi>Sixty Pounds</hi> upon another Perſon, and all his Goods car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away in about <hi>ten Cart-loads;</hi> and five Warrants at once for <hi>Fifty Pounds</hi> upon another, &amp;c. beſides what we have ſuffered by others in

And in this deſtructive Courſe the <hi>Informers</hi> have En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, and are ſuffered ſtill to go on, to the ruining many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies in their Trades and Livelihoods; divers ſo diſcouraged and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled, that they are forced to give over their Shops and Trades.</p>
                        <p>Theſe <hi>Informers</hi> being accepted for credible Witneſſes, <hi>yet Parties, ſwearing for their own Profit and Gain, in the Abſence of the Perſons proſecuted:</hi> This we think is very hard and undue Proceeding, and not conſiſtent with common Law or Juſtice.</p>

But many of the Epiſcopal Church were ſo ſtrongly bent to with-hold that Liberty from other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, that there were no ill-grounded Reports, that ſome in Authority had promiſed the King to give their Vote for Liberty of Conſcience to the Papiſts, provided it was not granted to other Diſſenters.

               <hi>If I had no true Repentance, I ſhould not be ſo free from the Fear of Death.</hi> And when it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, that he ought not to rely too much on that, ſince that might be the Effect of natural Courage, he ſaid, <hi>No, I don't aſcribe this to my Nature; for naturally I am more fearful than others, but now I am freed of Fear; becauſe I feel ſomething in me, which gives me Aſſurance that I ſhall go to God.</hi> The Executioner gave him ſeveral Strokes with the Ax, before the Head was ſevered from the Body; and ſome Eccleſiaſticks afterwards ſaid, <hi>He died an Enthuſiaſt:</hi> For not ſhewing himſelf very ready to comply with their Service, and his ſaying, <hi>That ſomething within him aſſured him that he ſhould go to God,</hi> ſeemed to them an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtical Tenet. But whatever it was, yet it ſeems very probable to me, that he was a true Penitent, and ſo died in Peace; for tho' I can't but diſapprove his Deſign, yet by true Repentance he might not only have obtained Forgiveneſs of God, but alſo have had a full Aſſurance of it.</p>

let you know, that we are ſo well ſatisfied with your Word and Oral Declaration concerning the afore-mentioned Thing, that this is more to us than any thing we could further deſire, as knowing that good Men think themſelves bound by their good Words to perform what is good. And ſince ye are ſenſible on what Ground ye came to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid Reſolution, and declared yourſelves thus, we doubt not but the ſame Perſuaſion and Reaſon continuing with you, will prove a more ſtrong Engagement to you to perform the ſame, than any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Seal can be. And in that Engagement we are willing to acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce, and ſhould not have mentioned any other, unleſs ſome among you, as we have been informed, firſt had made mention thereof. And as to what ye demand of us, we declare in the Nakedneſs and Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of our Hearts, that in Regard of our Temporal Converſation and Deportment, we deſire no further Protection, than when we deal righteouſly to all, and walk according to that Golden Rule, That we do unto all Men, what we deſire ſhould be done to us. And concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Religion and Worſhip, which we believe we owe to Almighty God, it is thus: That ſince it differs from other Perſuaſions, it makes us obnoxious not only to the Mockings and Revilings of ignorant People, but expoſeth us alſo to the Malice and Envy of many, who hate us without a juſt Cauſe; and therefore it is that we ſtand in need of your favourable Interpretation, and your beſt Conſtruction of what we do, and what we leave undone. And if we ſhould err in thoſe Matters, we ſhall be the greateſt Loſers by it; and if Truth be on our Side, then our Adverſaries ſhall not be able to prevail; for Truth is the ſtrongeſt, and it is not good for any to fight againſt it. Howſoever then it may be with us in this Matter, yet we hope that ye will be pleaſed, if we behave our ſelves peaceable and honeſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you and all Men, to let us be Partakers with our peaceable Neighbours of your general Protection. And tho' ye might pleaſe to give us a publick Act of your aforeſaid Reſolution, yet we clearly foreſee, that it would be hardly poſſible to uſe ſuch Expreſſions, that our Enemies, by ſome wreſting or other of the Words, or a wrong Interpretation of the Expreſſions contained therein, ſhould not be able to make us ſteemed guilty of Tranſgreſſion, and ſo find Matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us. And therefore we think it very ſafe to rely on your Word, and good Reſolution, in which it hath pleaſed you to declare, that we ſhall enjoy Liberty to live and trade in your City, provided we pay Cuſtom and Taxes which other Citizens are ſubject to; and that then we ſhall be at Liberty to meet together to worſhip God in ſuch a Way as he hath convinced us we ought to do, and to call upon him, and to exhort one another to Love and good Works, and a Chriſtian Converſation. And on your Behalf it will tend to the Praiſe of the Magiſtrates, that ye favour us in this. And it will alſo be to the promoting of God's Glory; and will oblige us to pray for you, that the Lord God may be pleaſed to preſerve you, and to make you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in ſuch a good, wholeſome, and well-grounded Reſolution. We are and reſt,</p>

            <p>Hereby we ſee how God hath the Hearts of all Men in his Hands, and that he turneth them whitherſoever he will: For the Magiſtrates of <hi>Embden</hi> had ſome Years before, from a blind Zeal, kindled by thoſe who ought to have ſtopt it, given forth very ſevere Edicts againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and perſecuted them fiercely; but now they allowed them an entire Liberty.</p>

What his Aim was, I am not to inveſtigate, for he never attained to it. In the mean while he made Perſecution generally to ceaſe, not only in <hi>England,</hi> but alſo in other Places of his Dominions: For having heard that the <hi>Quakers</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Barbadoes</hi> in the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> were very much moleſted, becauſe for Conſcience-ſake they could not bear Arms, he order'd ſome of the Members of his Council to write the following Letter.</p>

Therefore let all God's People be diligent, and careful to keep the Camp of God holy, pure and clean, and to ſerve God and Chriſt, and one another in the glorious, peaceable Goſpel of Life and Salvation; which Glory ſhines over God's Camp, and his great Prophet, and Biſhop, and Shepherd is among or in the midſt of them, exerciſing his Heavenly Offices in them: So that you his People may rejoice in Chriſt Jeſus, thro' whom you have Peace with God. For he that deſtroyeth the Devil and his Work, and bruiſes the Serpent's Head, is all God's People's heavenly Foundation and Rock to build upon; which was the Holy Prophets and Apoſtles Rock in Days paſt, and is now a Rock of our Age; which Rock and Foundation of God ſtandeth ſure. And upon this the Lord God eſtabliſh all his People. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>In this Year <hi>David Barclay</hi> died at <hi>Ury</hi> in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The pious End of <hi>D. Barclay,</hi> with ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions and Occurences a little before his Death.</note> Before his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture he utter'd many excellent Expreſſions indeed. I may not omit to mention ſome Particulars. In the latter End of <hi>September,</hi> being paſt the 76th Year of his Age, he was taken with a Fever, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued two Weeks; and being much troubled with the Gravel, his Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was accompanied with Pain in making Water. Two Days before his Death, feeling his Weakneſs, and being in an Agony, he ſaid to his Son <hi>Robert,</hi> who was with him, <hi>I ſhall go now to the Lord, and be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered to many of my Brethren who are gone before me.</hi> On the 11th of <hi>October,</hi> very early in the Morning, he growing weaker, the ſaid <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> ſignified to him, that his Travel was, <hi>That he that love<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Robert Barclay's</hi> Wife asking, if he would have ſomething to refreſh him, he ſaid, <hi>It needed not;</hi> and lay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing his Hand upon his Breaſt, he ſaid, <hi>He had that inwardly, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed him.</hi> A little while after, he was heard ſeveral Times to ſay, <hi>The Truth is over all;</hi> and taking his Son's eldeſt Son to him, he bleſſed him, and ſaid, <hi>He prayed God he might never depart from the Truth.</hi>
               <pb n="577" facs="unknown:003104_0588_0FEFF89146C45878"/>
Then his Son's eldeſt Daughter coming near, he ſaid, <hi>Is this</hi> Patience? (for that was her Name.) <hi>Let Patience have its perfect Work in thee.</hi> And after kiſſing the other four of his Son's Children, he laid Hands upon them, and bleſſed them. His Apothecary, that attended him, coming alſo near, he took him by the Hand, and ſaid, <hi>Thou wilt bear me witneſs, that in all this Exerciſe I have not been curious to tamper, nor to pamper the Fleſh.</hi> To which the Apothecary ſaid, <hi>Sir, I can bear witneſs that you have always minded the better and more ſubſtantial Part; and I rejoice to ſee the bleſſed End the Lord is bringing you to.</hi> To this the ſick Man reply'd, <hi>Bear a faithful and true Witneſs; yet it is the Life of Righteouſneſs; the Life of Righteouſneſs it is that we bear Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony to, and not to an empty Profeſſion.</hi> Then he called ſeveral Times, <hi>Come, Lord Jeſus, come, come!</hi> And ſaid alſo, <hi>My Hope is in the Lord.</hi> Afterward he ſlept now and then for ſome Hours; and ſeeing a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter coming into the Room, he ſaid to his Son, <hi>See thou charge him to make no manner of Superfluity upon the Coffin.</hi> In the Afternoon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of his Friends came to ſee him, which he having obſerved, ſaid, <hi>They were come in a ſeaſonable Time;</hi> and after ſome Words were ſpoken, and that <hi>Patrick Living ſtone</hi> had prayed, which ended in Praiſes, the ſick old Man held up his Hands, and ſaid, <hi>Amen, Amen, for ever!</hi> And after thoſe that were preſent ſtood up, he ſaid, <hi>How precious is the Love of God among his Children, and their Love to one another! Thereby ſhall all Men know that ye are Chriſt's Diſciples, if ye love one another. How precious a Thing it is to ſee Brethren to dwell together in Love! My Love is with you, I leave it among you.</hi> Several of his Friends, pretty late at Night, ſtanding about the Bed, and perceiving ſome of them to weep, he ſaid, <hi>Dear Friends, all mind the inward Man, heed not the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. There is one that doth reward, the Lord of Hoſts is his Name.</hi> Next Morning, after he had heard the Clock ſtrike Three, he ſaid, <hi>Now the Time comes.</hi> And a little after he was heard to ſay, <hi>Praiſes, Praiſes, Praiſes to the Lord! Let now thy Servant depart in Peace. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy Hands, O Father, I commit my Soul, Spirit and Body. Thy Will, O Lord, be done in Earth, as it is in Heaven.</hi> Theſe Sentences he ſpoke by little Intervals, one after another; and ſoon after five in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the 12th of <hi>October,</hi> he ſlept in Peace and Quiet, there being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at his End above twenty Perſons, who were Witneſſes to what hath been here related. His Corps was attended to the Grave by numerous Followers; and tho' he had order'd not many to be called to his Burial, yet a great Number of the Gentry came uninvited, from an Eſteem they bore to his Memory.</p>

            <p>About this Time, <hi>G. Fox</hi> writ ſome general Epiſtles (ſome: of which were pretty large) to his Friends, exhorting them to ſhun Strife, to keep to mutual Love and Unity, and to mind true Piety. He writ many other edifying Papers, and ſince the Papiſts now appeared barefaced, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed their Worſhip publickly, and there was much Talk of their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Saints,<note place="margin">1687</note> and by Beads, in the Year 1687 he emitted the following Paper concerning Prayer, not fearing to contradict openly that which he judged to be Superſtition, tho' the King himſelf was of the Popiſh Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <q>CHriſt Jeſus,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>G. F</hi>'s Paper concerning Prayer.</note> when he taught his Diſciples to pray, ſaid unto them, <hi>When ye do pray, ſay, Our Father which art in Heaven, hallowed be thy Name,</hi> &amp;c. Chriſt doth not ſay, that they ſhould pray to <hi>Mary,</hi> the Mother of Chriſt; nor doth he ſay, that they ſhould pray to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, or to Saints that were dead. Chriſt did not teach them to pray to the Dead, nor for the Dead. Neither did Chriſt or his Apoſtles teach the Believers to pray by Beads, nor to ſing by outward Organs: But the Apoſtle ſaid, he would <hi>ſing and pray in Spirit:</hi> For the Spirit it ſelf <hi>maketh Interceſſion; and the Lord, that ſearcheth the Hearty know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Mind of the Spirit.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>To take Counſel of the Dead, was forbidden by the Law of God; but they were to take Counſel of the Lord; And he hath given Chriſt in the New Covenant, in his Goſpel-day, to be a Counſellor and a Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to all his Believers in his Light. And Men are not to run to the Dead for the Living: For the Law and Teſtimony of God forbids it. Thoſe <hi>Jews,</hi> that refuſed the running Waters of <hi>Shiloh,</hi> the Floods and Waters of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> and <hi>Babylonians</hi> came over them, and carried them into Captivity: And they that refuſe the Waters of Chriſt, they are overflown with the Flood of the World, that lieth in Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs.

            <p>It would indeed have been more acceptable if this Liberty had been eſtabliſhed by the King and Parliament, this being granted as yet only by Vertue of his Royal Prerogative: But however it was, Liberty was enjoyed.

            <p>Here we ſee what the King declared to be his Intention: But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps that Prince did not conſider, that if ſuch a general Liberty had been procured, he ſhould not have been able to make it continue longer than the Popiſh Clergy would have thought it convenient. For who is ignorant what an unlimited Power the Roman Prelates have uſurped,
<pb n="582" facs="unknown:003104_0593_0FEFF8DB47FD8C28"/>
not only in the Eccleſiaſtical, but alſo in the Political Part? Inſomuch, that tho' the King's Intention might have been really ſincere, yet it's like it would have been thwarted, tho' he might have been willing that it ſhould be otherwiſe. That his Meaning was ſincere, ſeveral I know, that were not of his Perſuaſion, have believed; and among theſe there were ſuch, who thought that Liberty of Conſcience might have been ſo eſtabliſhed, that it ſhould not have been in the Power of the Papiſts to break it. But Time hath ſhewn, that King <hi>James</hi> was not to be the Inſtrument for Settling ſuch a Liberty of Conſcience, and that the Repealing of the penal Laws was reſerved for another Prince. Yet the King was by ſome thought to do what he could to ſtop rapacious Perſecutors, and to reſtrain their Power, with Reſpect to impoſing of Oaths. It is true, it was ſaid that the King might not do ſo; for by granting this Liberty to the <hi>Quakers,</hi> he opened a Door for the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts</hi> to bear Offices, without taking the required Oaths. Now that he diſcharged the <hi>Quakers</hi> from theſe Oaths, may appear by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Order to the Lord Mayor of <hi>London;</hi>

By ſuch Means ſome got their Goods again, that had been taken from them upon the Account of religious Worſhip; for in many Places they lay long unſold, becauſe few would buy Goods ſo taken. And that the King by theſe his Favours drew the Love and Affection of many of his Subjects towards himſelf, none need to wonder; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his Religion was, he delivered them from that grievous Burden, under which they had been oppreſſed ſo many Years. To this may be added, that he uſed them kindly in all Reſpects, and would not ſuffer his Servants to moleſt any for not pulling off their Hats, when they came near his Royal Perſon; Nay, ſo far went this Condeſcenſion, that a certain Country-man of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Perſuaſion,<note place="margin">The King ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers <hi>Quakers</hi> to appear cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</note> coming to him with his Hat on his Head, the King took off his own Hat, and held it under his Arm; which the other ſeeing, ſaid, <hi>The King needs not keep off his Hat for me.</hi> To which that Prince returned, <hi>You don't know the Cuſtom here, for that requires, that but one Hat muſt be on here.</hi> I have been told of more ſuch like Occurrences, which I paſs by; but it appears from thence, that the King endeavoured to have among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> the Repute of a mild and courteous Prince.<note place="margin">Grants free Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience alſo in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </note> And this Year he gave in <hi>Scotland</hi> alſo full Liberty of Conſcience, and freed thoſe that were ſtill under Sufferings, granting them the free Liberty of their religious Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.

                        <p>WE the King's loving and peaceable Subjects,<note place="margin">Another Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs</note> from divers Parts of his Dominions, being met together in this City, after our uſual Manner, to inſpect the Affairs of our chriſtian Society through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the World, think it our Duty humbly to repreſent to him, the bleſſed Effects the Liberty he has graciouſly granted his People to <hi>worſhip God</hi> according to their Conſciences, hath had, <hi>both on our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Eſtates:</hi> For whereas formerly we had ever long and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful Liſts brought to us from all Parts almoſt of his Territories, of Priſoners, and the Spoils of Goods, by violent and ill Men, upon Account of Conſcience, <hi>We bleſs God, and thank the King,</hi> the Jails are every where clear, except in Caſes of Tithes, and the Repairs of Pariſh-Churches, and ſome few about Oaths; and we do in all Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity lay it before the King, to conſider the Hardſhips our Friends are yet under for Conſcience-ſake in thoſe Reſpects, being in the one chiefly expoſed to the preſent Anger of the offended Clergy, who have therefore lately impriſon'd ſome of them till Death; and in the other they are <hi>rendered very unprofitable to the Publick and themſelves;</hi> for both <hi>in Reference to Freedoms in Corporations, Probates of Wills and Teſtaments, and Adminiſtrations, Anſwers in Chancery, and Exchequer, Trials of our juſt Titles and Debts, Proceeding in our Trade at the Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom-Houſe, Serving the Office of Conſtables,</hi> &amp;c. they are diſabled, and great Advantages taken againſt them, unleſs the King's Favour do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe; and as we humbly hope he may relieve us, ſo we confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſure our ſelves he will eaſe us what he can.</p>
                        <p>Now ſince it has pleaſed thee, O King, to renew to all thy Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, by thy laſt Declaration, thy gracious Aſſurances to purſue the Eſtabliſhment of this Chriſtian Liberty and Property upon an unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Foundation; and in Order to it, to hold a Parliament in <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> next at fartheſt:</p>
                        <p>We think our ſelves deeply engaged to renew our Aſſurances of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity and Affection, and with God's Help, intend to do our Parts for the perfecting ſo bleſſed and glorious a Work; that ſo it may be out of the Power of any one Party to hurt another upon the Account of Conſcience: And as we firmly believe that God will never deſert this juſt and righteous Cauſe of Liberty, nor the King in maintaining of it, ſo we hope by God's Grace to let the World ſee we can honeſtly and heartily appear for Liberty of Conſcience, and be inviolably true to our own Religion, whatever the Folly or Malice of ſome Men on that Account, may ſuggeſt to the contrary.</p>

            <p>This Addreſs being preſented to the King was well received.

            <p>But to return to my Relation, and to take up again the Thread of this Hiſtory, from which I have been diverted a little by this Digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; I know there were ſome in thoſe Days, who thought that if People of all Perſuaſions in <hi>England</hi> had a Share in the Government, proportionable to their Number, a Means might have been found out, to hinder any Party, eſpecially the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> from exalting themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the others. But to me it ſeems not improbable, that if this had Effect, and a higher Hand had not cut off the Way thereto, it would have appeared that thoſe Men did not reckon well. But it never came to this Paſs, for the King's Power was tottering already, tho' he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſupport it, even with good Means; for to be helpful to his Subjects, who, tho' free-born Men, were deprived of their Freedom, meerly becauſe for Conſcience-ſake they could not ſwear, and to help them to this Right to which they were entitled as well as others, could not be judged undue Means, unleſs under it had been hidden an Intent to introduce this Liberty alſo in Favour of the Papiſts, tho' they did not believe Swearing unlawful.</p>
            <p>There were now at <hi>Norwich</hi> about Forty of the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> who having petitioned the King, that he would be pleaſed to cauſe them to be made Freemen, obtained the following Order from him.</p>

            <p>'Twas now ſaid commonly,<note place="margin">Theſe Favours are ill repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but other Affairs here mention'd were the Cauſe of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Diſcontent.</note> that the King might not do thus; and thoſe who grudged the <hi>Quakers</hi> this Liberty, did not ſtick to ſet forth this Diſpenſation in very ill-favoured Colours; nay they ſaid that <hi>William Penn</hi> adviſed the King to do, what he could not do without breaking his Promiſe. But if the King had made no greater Infringement, his Reign it may be would have laſted longer: But the Diſpoſſeſſing of the Fellows of <hi>Magdalen College</hi> at <hi>Oxford,</hi> the Impriſonment of the Biſhops, and the publick Admittance of Jeſuits and Monks, cauſed a Ferment in the Minds of People. Now the Biſhops were tried at the King's-bench-bar, in <hi>Weſtminſter-hall;</hi> but they were acquitted, and ſo releaſed. The King
<pb n="587" facs="unknown:003104_0598_0FEFF8A06B9161A0"/>alſo had appointed ſome Eccleſiaſtical Commiſſioners; but many look'd upon this as a kind of Inquiſition, and it ſeemed not well to agree with Liberty of Conſcience, which if he had maintained juſtly, according to the Advice of the <hi>Quakers</hi> in their Addreſs, it is not likely that he would have come to ſuch a Strait, as now he was put to.</p>
            <p>Not long before this Time,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>T. Townſend</hi> publiſhes a very remarkable Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of her own and her Friends Sufferings in <hi>Gloceſterſh.</hi>
               </note> one <hi>Theophila Townſend,</hi> a Woman of Years and Underſtading, publiſhed a Book, wherein ſhe gave a Relation of the grievous Perſecution her Friends in <hi>Gloceſterſhire</hi> had ſuffered, by Impriſonment and Spoil of Goods, and how ſhe herſelf had alſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone many Sufferings, and had been impriſoned in the Caſtle of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter</hi> more than three Years. Among other Caſes ſhe relates alſo, how ſome Time before her Impriſonment it happened, that by Order of the Juſtices <hi>Thomas Cutler,</hi> and <hi>James George,</hi> ſhe being ſeized in the Street, ſaid to the Latter, That the Lord would plead her Cauſe, and that what Meaſure he meted, ſhould be meaſured to him again. And it thus happened, that before ſhe was releaſed, the Wife of the ſaid <hi>George,</hi> who took her from her Husband, was by Death taken from him. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this <hi>George</hi> came with the Biſhop of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> into a Meeting, where <hi>Theophila</hi> was on her Knees praying: At which the Biſhop asking him, Whether ſhe was the Woman he ſpoke of, and he anſwering, <hi>Yes, my Lord;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Violence of the Biſhop of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceſter</hi>
               </note> the Biſhop took her by the Arm with ſuch Violence, that he had almoſt pulled her down backward, ſaying, <hi>Give over, Woman, and obey the King's Officers.</hi> But ſuch was her Zeal that it could not be ſtop'd; for the more Oppoſition ſhe met with, the more ſhe felt herſelf encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, and inſpired, to praiſe God for his Goodneſs; And tho' the Biſhop ſtirred up the Juſtice, yet it ſeemed not in his Power to break off the Current of her Speech; ſo that they let her alone, till ſhe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving diſcharged herſelf, ſtood up. Then the Names of thoſe that were met, were taken in Writing; and ſome Time after, ſhe, tho' aged and weakly, was in Winter-ſeaſon led three or four Miles thro' the Snow, and committed to Jail at <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> where ſhe was kept three Years and four Months, and then releaſed by King <hi>James.</hi> Afterward ſhe publiſhed a Book, as hath been ſaid already, in which ſhe gave an Account how ſome of her Friends had been beaten, punch'd, and abuſed to that Degree, that they died of it, as ſhe teſtified to have ſeen her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: <q>Yet, ſaid ſhe, tho' many died who were ſtronger than I, it hath pleaſed the Lord to preſerve my Life, that I may ſpeak to the Praiſe of his Name, and tell of his Wonders, and put you, Perſecutors, once more in Mind what belongs to your Peace. Bleſſed be the Lord, he is riſen for <hi>Zion</hi>'s-ſake, which ye have plowed long as a Field; and when her Enemies have done their Worſt, then the Lord ſhall make his <hi>Zion</hi> to be an everlaſting Glory, and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the Praiſe of the whole Earth.

            <p>I am come now almoſt to a Concluſion of my Relation concerning Perſecution; of which I could have written much more, but that I was unwilling to extend my Work beyond what I ſhould have been well able to compleat.

Sometime after, the ſaid Juſtice com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again with an High Conſtable, and another, a petty Conſtable, ſeized a Barge, and had it carried away, and ſeveral Times offered it to Sale, but none would buy it. And after it had been carried about from Place to Place for Sale, at length it was found adrift, by one who knew not of its being ſeized; and hearing that it was <hi>Theophilus</hi>'s Barge, he brought it to him. But <hi>Theophilus</hi> went to the Conſtables, and told them how it came to him, and where he had it, ſaying, <hi>Since it was come to him again, he was willing to keep it; but if they took it away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, he would not hinder them.</hi> This Account being given to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, he ſent a Warrant, and committed <hi>Theophilus</hi> to the <hi>Marſhalſea</hi> Priſon.

Penn,</hi> who, when the Government of King <hi>James</hi> was ſinking, not only bore the Blame of many Miſcarriages, but by ſome was ſtiled a Papiſt, tho' this was altogether falſe. But he had a great many Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and it was no new Thing to brand the <hi>Quakers</hi> with the odious Name of Jeſuits: For thirty Years before this Time at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> great Endeavours were uſed to perſuade People they were Franciſcans. <hi>W. Penn</hi> patiently bore the Slander of being decried as a Papiſt, ſaying but little in Juſtification of himſelf, till at length he made a Return to a Letter ſent by one who ſeriouſly begg'd of him to give an Anſwer to thoſe Accuſations that had been forged in Prejudice of his Reputation. In this Paper, <q>He aſcribed his free Acceſs to the King, partly to the Relation his Father, as Admiral, had to the Service of the ſaid King, who was then Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and High Admiral of <hi>England;</hi> and his ſpecial Favour alſo in releaſing him out of the Tower of <hi>London</hi> in the Year 1669.</q> To this he added, <hi>My Father's humble Requeſt to him upon his Death-bed was, to protect me from the Inconveniences and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles my Perſuaſion might expoſe me unto; and his friendly Promiſe to do it, and exact Performance of it, from the Moment I addreſs'd my ſelf to him: I ſay, when all this is conſidered, any Body that hath the leaſt Pretence to Good-nature, Gratitude, or Generoſity, muſt needs know how to interpret my Acceſs to the King.—Is any thing more fooliſh as well as falſe, than that becauſe I am often at</hi> Whitehall, <hi>therefore I muſt be Author of all that is done there, that doth not pleaſe abroad. But ſuppoſing ſome ſuch Things to have been done; pray tell me if I am bound to oppoſe any Thing I am not called to do? I never was a Member of Council, Cabinet, or Committee, where the Affairs of the Kingdom are tranſacted. I have had no Office or Truſt, and conſequently nothing can be ſaid to be done by me; nor, for that Reaſon, could I lie under any Teſt or any Obligation to diſcover my Opinion of publick Acts of State: And therefore, neither can any ſuch Acts, nor any Silence about them, in Juſtice be made my Crime. Volunteers are Blanks and Cyphers in all Governments. And unleſs calling at</hi> Whitehall <hi>once a Day, upon many Occaſions, or my not being turned out of nothing, (for that no Office is) be the Evidence of my Compliance in diſagreeable Things, I know not what elſe can with any Truth be alledged againſt me. — I am not without Apprehenſions of the Cauſe of this Behaviour towards me; I mean my conſtant Zeal for an impartial Liberty of Conſcience. But if that be it, the Cauſe is too good to be in Pain about it. I ever underſtood that to be the natural Right of all Men; and that he that had a Religion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, his Religion was one of his own Make. For what is not the Religion of a Man's Choice, is the Religion of him that impoſes it: So that Liberty of Conſcience is the firſt Step to have a Religion. This is no new Opinion with me, I have writ many Apologies within the laſt Twenty Years to defend it, and that impartially. Yet I have as conſtantly declared that Bounds ought to be ſet to this Freedom, and that Morality was the beſt; and that as often as that was violated under a Pretence of Conſcience, it was fit the Civil Power ſhould take Place. Nor did I ever once think of promoting any Sort of Liberty of Conſcience for any body, which did not preſerve the common Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancy of the Kingdom, and the ancient Rights of the Government: For to ſay Truth, the one cannot be maintained without the other.— And till I ſaw my
<pb n="591" facs="unknown:003104_0602_0FEFF928728B54C0"/>own Friends, with the Kingdom, delivered from the Legal Bondage which Penal Laws for Religion had ſubjected them to, I could with no Satisfaction think of leaving</hi> England, <hi>tho' much to my Prejudice beyond Sea, and at my great Expence here, having in all this Time neither had either Office or Penſion, and always refuſing the Rewards or Gratuities of thoſe I have been able to oblige.</hi> From this little Abſtract of <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s Apology, it appears ſufficiently what kind of Liberty he defended; And ſuch a Liberty after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards took Place in the Reign of the next King.</p>

He was born in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> and in his Youth was a Shepherd, and afterwards put Apprentice to a Clothier; but when the Civil Wars broke out, he became a Soldier, and joined with thoſe who ſaid they ſought for the Goſpel. Now tho' he was religious according to his Knowledge, yet growing more and more ſerious, and turning his Mind inwardly, he ſaw there were inward and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Enemies to encounter with, according to the Saying of the Apoſtle, <hi>We wreſtle not againſt Fleſh and Blood, but againſt ſpiritual Wickedneſs,</hi>

If my Kingdom were of this World, then would my Servants fight.</hi> This wrought ſo powerfully upon his Mind, that he could no longer meddle with martial Affairs, but left the Army, and returned to his former Calling, endeavouring to improve in true Godlineſs, in which he ſo advanced gradually, that when <hi>G. F.</hi> in the Year 1651, came to <hi>Balby</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> and preached the Goſpel there, he could not but conſent to the Doctrine declared by him, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame of which he himſelf was already convinced in his Mind, <hi>viz.</hi> That Heed ought to be given to the inward divine Reprovings for that which is evil, which Doctrine was preached by <hi>G.

As you are all driven and forced out of Paradice, and the flaming Sword and the Cherubims are ſet to keep the Way of the Tree of Life, ſo you muſt return into the Favour of God again, by the Light of Chriſt, and you have Line upon Line, Precept upon Precept, here a little, and there a little, to direct your Minds to the Light of Chriſt Jeſus. As the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was made a living Soul, ſo the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> is a quickning Spirit.

Now all of you that come to be Regenerated, you muſt come to the Light of Chriſt, there is no other Way to it. He will ſearch your Hearts, and try your Reins, and ſet your Sins in Order before you, and trace out the Iniquities that compaſs you about; therefore you muſt ſee your ſelves a loſt People, a ſinful People, and ſo come to feel the Weight of your Sins upon your Conſciences, there is no other Way to come to Life; you will never complain of Sin till you be burthened with it, till you have a Trumpet ſounding in your Ears, to awaken you, that you may ariſe from the Dead, that Chriſt may give you Light; there is no other Way, dear People, you muſt bring your Deeds to the Light of Chriſt, and abide in the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Condemnation; if you ſave your Lives, you loſe them; if you will loſe your Lives for Chriſt's ſake, there is no Danger of your eternal Life. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, Chriſt's Forerunner, declared, <hi>I indeed baptize you with Water unto Repentance, but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, the Latchet of whoſe Shoes I am not worthy to unlooſe, he ſhall bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize you with the Holy Ghoſt, and with Fire, whoſe Fan is in his Hand, and he will throughly purge his Floor, and will gather his Wheat into his Garner, but the Chaff he will burn with unquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Fire.</hi> What is it the better for you to read the Scripture if you know not this fiery Baptiſm, which all muſt know that are regenerated; deceive not your ſelves, Chriſt will <hi>appear in flaming Fire, and take Vengeance on all them that know not God, and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>I ſtand here as a Witneſs of the Lord of Life this Day, there is no Way for People to come to Salvation, but they muſt know Chriſt revealed in all their Hearts. What is he doing but rendring Vengeance upon the carnal Mind, ſelf pleaſing, and all inordinate Affections; he comes with Vengeance to take away thy Life, he will baptize thee with the Holy Ghoſt, and with Fire. If thou knoweſt not this, thou art not a true Chriſtian, thou wilt never look Death in the Face with Joy, nor go down to the Grave with Triumph. If thou liveſt at home in the Body, and flyeſt for thy Life, and wilt not be willing to loſe thy Life for Chriſt, if thou art called to it, and if thou wilt nor have Chriſt to waſh thee (ſome for Shyneſs, and ſome for Self-love will refuſe this) if Chriſt doth not waſh thee, thou haſt no Part in him; you muſt come to Chriſt to purify you in the fiery Furnace; <hi>the Day of the Lord ſhall burn as an Oven,</hi> (as the Prophet ſpeaks) this is a dreadful Day, a Day of Vengeance, the Day of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who redeemeth his People from their Sins, <hi>Sion is redeemed with Judgment, and eſtabliſhed with Righteouſneſs.</hi> Do not make the Way to Heaven eaſier in your Minds and Imaginations than indeed it is, and think it not ſufficient to live in an outward Obſervance of the Ways of God. If your own Wills be alive, and your Corruption remain unmortified, the Judgment of God will be your Portion, therefore in the Lord's Name come along with me, I am come to declare what I have heard and ſeen of the Father. Come and examine thy Conſcience, haſt thou brought thy Deeds to the Light? then thou haſt received Condemnation upon thy ſelf, and thy Haughtineſs is bowed down, and laid low, and thou ſeeſt thy ſelf a poor miſerable Wretch before the eternal God. Whatſoever thou knoweſt of the Mind of God, haſt thou reformed thy Ways? Come along with me, and tell me what is the Ground of thy Faith, and thy Confidence; is it thy Obedience and Qualifications? Becauſe thy Obedience is right, and thy Qualifications right, what Uſe doſt thou make of them? Read the Book of Conſcience; haſt thou no Ground for thy Faith? Thou haſt put on the reformed Faith, and liveſt an unreformed Life; ſearch and try thy ſelf, Man, or Woman. Doſt thou watch over thy ſelf, and keep in a Senſe of thy Diſſolution, notwithſtanding all thy Qualifications and partial Reformation? Doſt thou <hi>ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait Gate, and the narrow Way?</hi> Here is the loſt Sheep, thou ſeekeſt, the Life of thy Will, the Life of the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> the Juſtice of God will not ſuffer thee to make a Saviour of thy Duties and Qualifications, and to take God's Jewels and to deck thy ſelf with them; thou canſt not be ſaved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Righteouſneſs of God in Chriſt Jeſus. What ſaith thy Conſcience, art thou brought to this Change of thy Mind, and of thy Converſation? Are you all willing to part with your Sins, with your Pride and Haughtineſs? Are you willing to part with your vile Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? This is the Work of God's Grace upon you. Doſt thou place thy Confidence in thy Duties and Qualifications, and takeſt God's Jewels and Ornaments and deckeſt thy ſelf with them? <hi>Thou tookeſt my Jewels,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>and didſt play the Harlot.</hi> If thou return to the Lord, and humble thy ſelf, and get thro' this Difficulty, thou wilt be happy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. This Judgment of God, this flaming Sword that turns every Way, will keep thee from returning to Sin, and bring thee to Chriſt, and cut thee off from all Hope of Salvation but by him, and make thee to ſee the abſolute need of a Saviour, and that thy <hi>Life is hid with Chriſt in God.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>It is God's infinite Goodneſs to Men that he will hide Pride from them, and humble them under his mighty Hand. This is the Condition of poor Creatures that are ſlain by the Hands of the moſt High: How may I know when I am ſlain and baptized, and come to have Sincerity? They that have this Baptiſm enter into the Heavenly Life. If you love the Light of Chriſt Jeſus, it will be thus with you; God will make ſhort work in the Earth. He will ſet thy Sins in order before thee, and make thee watchful unto Prayer, and lead thee to Holineſs of Life and Converſation, and make thee abhor thy ſelf, and deſpiſe all the Pomps and Pleaſures and Vanities of this World. When he hath adorned thee with his Graces, then watch for the Light, and in the Light of Chriſt thou ſhalt ſee Light, and that all thou haſt done, and canſt do, is but thy Duty. All this thou oughteſt to do; thou art God's Creature, and all this will not juſtifie thee in order to thy Eternal Salvation, for theſe Services thou oweſt unto God. If thou diligently wait, thou ſhalt ſee more Light; then the Sword that proceeds out of the Mouth of Chriſt, who is called the Word of God, will cut thee off from all thy Hopes of Salvation from any Thing thou haſt done, from any of thy Qualifications, from any Thing that thou canſt do, ſo that thou wilt be a hopeleſs Soul, nothing in thy own Senſe and Apprehenſion. The Power of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> muſt die before him, and thou wilt cry out, I am a dead, loſt, and undone Creature, but there is a Life hid with Chriſt in God for me; but I can never have it till I be ſlain into the Will of God, and become as a little Child, and be ſtript of all my own Excellency that I have attained. I muſt come to a Senſe of my own Miſery, and fall down at the Foot of God; when I am become as a little Child, humbled and ſlain as to my own Will, and Confidence in my own Righteouſneſs; I will not then queſtion but I ſhall live a holy Life, but I will give all that Life I had, for that <hi>Life which is hid with Chriſt in God;</hi> O! there is none come ſo far, that ever miſs of Eternal Life. All ſhuffling People that would have Salvation by Chriſt, and will not let him exerciſe his heavenly Power, his princely glorious Power to baptize them into his Death, it is they that come ſhort of Salvation; but all thoſe that yield themſelves up to Chriſt to be redeemed thro' Judgment, and are become as little Children, theſe are in a happy State. You know that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt took a little Child in his Arms, and ſaid. Whoſoever becomes not as a little Child, cannot enter into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ven. You muſt all of you become as little Children, and depend upon the Mercy and free Grace of God; you muſt all come to a holy Reſignation of your ſelves to God's Diſpoſal. If you come to Chriſt as little Children, and depend upon him, you cannot miſs of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it is entailed upon ſuch Souls as hear the Voice of Chriſt; they that hear the Voice of the Son of God ſhall live.</p>
                              <p>I ſtand here as a Witneſs for the God of Heaven. I never heard the Voice of Chriſt (as his Follower, till I was ſlain and baptized, and lay as a little Child under his Heavenly Chaſtiſements. Aſſoon as ever my Soul was brought to this in my Humiliation, O then the dreadful Judgment was taken away, and the Book of Life was opened unto me, and the Lord ſpake comfortably to me, <hi>I have loved thee with an everlaſting Love;</hi> and I was made a Chriſtian thro' a Day of Vengeance, and of burning as an Oven; and the Haughtineſs and Pride of Man in me was brought low. Now in this Conformity to Chriſt's Death, People may die into Life, and bleſſed are the Dead that die in the Lord, for they reſt from their Labours, and their Works do follow them. Away with all your own Will, and your Pride, and Haughtineſs, and your Hypocriſy, and Deceit, and all Dependancy upon any Qualification of your own. You muſt come to have your Life ſeparated from you, elſe you will all periſh. Thoſe that will die with Chriſt, and be willing to die for him, he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed as a Saviour to them. He was before us in the Days of his Fleſh, and complied with his Father's Will, he was nailed to the Croſs. The Son of God, when he was come to the Depth of his Sufferings, what was his Cry? <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> This was for thy Sake, and my Sake, and every Man and Woman's Sake that do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him; he drank the Cup which his Father gave him to drink; <hi>If it was done thus to the green Tree, what ſhall be done unto the dry?</hi> He went before us, and when he cometh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain he will take us to himſelf, and take us from the Filth of Sin, that we may be made new Creatures.</p>
                              <p>Now except we be born again, we cannot enter into the Kingdom of God, and there is no becoming new Creatures, till we be ſlain to the old Man. Thou muſt be ſlain to thy Pride and Haughtineſs, and the Corruption of thine own Will, and all Selfiſhneſs, thou muſt have God to burn it up in thee; the Holy Ghoſt will deſtroy and burn up nothing in thee, but that which will bring an eternal Fire upon thy Soul; ſhew me, thou whom my Soul lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, where is the Path of Life, the Foot-ſteps of the Flock of thy Companions? Why ſhould I be as one that goes aſide? Now every one that lives at home in the Boſom of Self, take this with you, Tho' you profeſs the Truth, and live in an outward Conformity thereunto, yet if you ſecretly indulge your corrupt Wills, and live a Fleſh-pleaſing Life, and conſult with Fleſh and Blood, and are not rent off from your Luſts, you cannot enjoy the Lord of Life; <hi>While I am at home in the Body, I am abſent from the Lord.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>The Body of Sin is a Loadſtone to draw you from the Life of God, and from glorying in the Croſs of Chriſt: This is Fleſh and Blood, and <hi>Fleſh and Blood cannot inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</hi> For the Lord's Sake, for your Soul's Sake, and for the Sake of your Eternal Happineſs, put not off this Work, but purſue it, and it will be perfected. <hi>See how Chriſt is revealed in you by the Holy Ghoſt, and with Fire.</hi> God will <hi>redeem you by the Spirit of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Burning:</hi> It is not ranging abroad with your Minds, but you muſt know <hi>Chriſt is in you except ye he Reprobates.</hi> If he hath ſet your Eyes and Hearts upon himſelf, and made you to <hi>water your Couch with your Tears;</hi> if he hath broken your Sleep, ſo as you have cry'd out, I ſhall be damned and never come to Salvation; (This will be your Cry, it was once my Cry,) O let not your Eyes ſlumber, nor your Eyelids take any Reſt, till you be ſure the Lord is your God. If you find theſe Qualifications, you are on your Way, otherwiſe you will be like a deceitful Bow, and never abide in Judgment. If you reject the Counſel of God againſt your ſelves, and refuſe to be crucified with Chriſt, and to be baptized with his Baptiſm, you will never have Life; but by his Baptiſm, and thro' the heavenly Operation of his Spirit, if thou haſt Faith in Chriſt's Name, thou ſhalt be married to him in everlaſting Righteouſneſs. Salvation ſhall be brought to us, and eternal. Life be beſtowed upon us, even that Life which is hid with Chriſt in God, he will give to every poor mournful Soul, that ſubmits to his bleſſed Will, and believeth in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: This is not a Faith of our own making, nor a Garment of our own Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidery, but that which the Lord hath given to us. O happy Man or Woman, that obtaineſt this Gift of God! O! Who will not loſe their Lives for this everlaſting Life? Who will not die for this eternal Life? Now the Matter lies in the Death of your own Wills, when you have done the Will of God, then watch that your own Wills be ſlain, and that your curſed Self take not the Jewels of God, and his Bracelets and Ornaments, and beſtow them upon Self, and paint and deck curſed Self; and take not the Members of Chriſt, and make them the Members of an Harlot: If you be dead to your own Wills you are riſen with Chriſt, and ſhall receive a Reſurrection to eternal Life: Crucifie Self, and ſet the World at nought, and trample upon it, and all Things of it, and count them as Droſs and Dung in compariſon of Chriſt, that the Father hath revealed to be our Life, in the Days of our Sorrow and Mourning, in the Day of our Calamity, in the Day when we cried, our Hope is loſt.</p>
                              <p>Thus it hath been with the holieſt People on Earth. It is not by Works of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thy own that thou canſt be ſaved; Chriſt comes to cut all theſe down, that thou mayſt be ingrafted into him, and juſtified by his Grace. Do not make this Matter of Talk, and ſay, I have heard this and that, but look into your own Hearts, and ſee what heavenly Workings are there; what there is of the Power of the Lord Jeſus, that hath made you to loath this World, and the inordinate Love of the Creature, that you may enjoy all theſe Things, as if you enjoyed them not. We cannot when we are ſlain and crucified to this World, but ſay, My Life is in Chriſt, when we come to aſcribe nothing to our ſelves, and all to Chriſt; here is a bleſſed Harmony, broken Hearts, melted Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and yet joyful Souls; poor Creatures that were mourning and ſighing, and crying before the Lord in retired Places, and yet rejoicing in Chriſt Jeſus. I am riſen with Chriſt, I ſaid, my Hope is cut off, I will lie down in thy Will, O God; do what thou wilt with me, it is in thy ſovereign Pleaſure and free Gift, whether thou give me Life, or deny it to me. There muſt be a Reſignation of our ſelves to the Will of God; it was ſo with the Lord Jeſus, and it is ſo with every true Saint of God; you muſt be humbled as little Children before Judgment be taken away, and the Loving-kindneſs of God ſealed up to your Souls. If you ſeek this Work of God, you will find it; if you ſeek it upon your Beds, in all your Labours and Concernments, in all your Stations and Relations; if you preſs after the New Birth, you muſt uſe this World, as if you uſed it not, and live a married Life, as if you were unmarried, for the Faſhion of this World paſſeth away. This is not Rantiſm.</p>
                              <p>But let me tell you, a New World comes by Regeneration; a Man is not lifted up in his own Mind, but laid low in his own Eyes, he waits for the Wiſdom of God to govern him, and he is as a Steward of the Grace of God, to give to them that ſtand in need. When a Man is regenerated and born again, he is as contented with Bread and Water, as with all the Enjoyments of this World: What is the Matter? His own Will is gone, and put down under his Feet, and whatſoever it is that gives Life to all his vain Deſires and Affections, there is a Harmony of all within, a Man praiſing of God, and bleſſing his Holy Name; there are no Intanglements ſhall draw away the Heart from ſerving of God, and ſeeking his Glory; and if God ſhall call the Husband from the Wife, or the Wife from the Husband for the Glory of his Name, there is no whining, and complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and crying out, but giving them up, and a praiſing and bleſſing God when they are called to ſuch an Exerciſe; and if they are not called to that, then they ſet their Hearts to glorifie God in their ſeveral Places and Stations; then they have a full Content in a bleſſed Reſignation. Here their Wills are ſlain, but they praiſe God they have no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, but Lord thy Will be done; always praiſing God, always having the Fear, and the Glory of God before their Eyes. All the Miſchief is hatch'd in pleaſing Mens own Wills: That is, the Counſel of every Heart that Chriſt doth not govern: Will you live as the <hi>Quakers?</hi> Then you muſt live contemptibly, the Miſtreſs and Maid are Hail-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, well met. No, every one muſt walk in Humility, and live in Acquaintance with the God of Heaven; ſhe that is wrought upon by the ſame Spirit, muſt with all Diligence behave herſelf as becomes a Servant of the Lord. Here is now a New World, and the Faſhions of the Old World are gone; all Pride, Haughtineſs, Croſſneſs and trampling upon one another are all gone, all ſlain, thro' the Operation of Chriſt.</p>
                              <p>What remains now? Chriſt is in me, and we are all one in him. Chriſt laid down his Life for thee and me; now he reigns in me, and he hath prepared my Body to die for the Truth, as his prepared Body was laid down for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                                 </gap>y Sin. It is a kind of fooliſh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, to make Profeſſion of Chriſt, and live in Covetouſneſs, Profaneneſs, Senſuality, and the like; they that are come to this heavenly Birth ſeek the Things that are above, thou canſt do no other. <hi>Make the Tree good, and the Fruit will be good.</hi> You muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted into the Vine of God's Righteouſneſs: O! ſlight not the Day of your Viſitation. What was it to me to read of any being born again, till I was ſlain, and knew the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Baptiſm of Chriſt Jeſus? Till I ſaw the flaming Sword ready to ſlay me in every Way, in every Turning. The Light of Chriſt convinced me of Sin, and his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs juſtified me, and thoſe Works were abominable to me, that hindred my Soul's Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to Chriſt. Chriſt Jeſus in marrying my Soul to himſelf, ſeized upon me, and did work effectually in me: There is the Teſtimony of Chriſt in me, he hath ſealed up my Soul to the Day of my Redemption: Here is a certain Paſſage, and a certain Way which never any miſs of, that loſe their Lives for Chriſt: If you be not ready and willing to loſe your Lives for Chriſt, you ſhall never come here: The Gate is ſtraight, and the Way is narrow; none come hither but thoſe that die into a heavenly Oneneſs with Chriſt. O Friends, let us empty our ſelves, that Chriſt may fill us; let us be nothing in our own Eyes, that we may be all in him, and receive of his Fulneſs.</p>
                              <p>Now I commend you to God's Witneſs, that you may remember what hath been ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken among you; but conſider, if you do not hearken to it, it will follow you, and be a Plague to you to all Eternity. If you will not yield up your ſelves to Chriſt this Day that burns like an Oven, this Fire you muſt dwell with when out of the Body, there will be no quenching of this Fire for ever; but if you be ſo wiſe for your Souls, as to reſign your ſelves up to Chriſt, and come to him as little Children, this will not hinder your earthly Concerns. Tho' the World may account thee a Fool, yet thou haſt that Part of heavenly Wiſdom, to do what thou doſt as unto God; thou carrieſt to thy Wife, as in the ſight of God, that ſhe may be ſanctified to thee, and thou to her; and thou carrieſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comingly to thy Children and Servants, and thou wilt abound in Grace, and in every good Work, which will be for thine Eternal Welfare.</p>
                              <p>O! I beſeech you People, for the Lord's ſake, wait for the Light of Chriſt to guide you; learn of him to be meek and lowly, then happy are you; for <hi>he dwelleth with the Humble, but he beholdeth the Proud afar off.</hi> This New Birth, which is a true Work, a ſincere and heavenly Work, it will make you for ever. O make Room for Chriſt in your Hearts, or elſe he is never like to dwell with you. He loveth to dwell with the poor and humble and contrite Spirit, he abhors the Proud, he will empty your Souls, that he may fill them.</p>
                              <p>And ſo I commend you to God. I have been long held in Durance under great Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and I was reſtleſs, till I could come up to this great City of <hi>London,</hi> to preach the Everlaſting Goſpel among you, and you ſee I am among you here: Pray every one of you turn inward; let not theſe Words paſſing thro' a mean Veſſel be as a bare empty Diſcourſe of Truth to you, which you only hear, and take no further Care of your Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Take heed of deſpiſing the Light that ſhines in the midſt of you, and be preſſing forward to the heavenly Work that is laid in the Power of Chriſt Jeſus, even thro' Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into Death, and then he will give eternal Life. The Lord confirm this, that it may reſt upon your Hearts, that you may be dead to the Things of the World. <hi>We are not come to Mount</hi> Sinai, <hi>that genders to Bondage, but we are come to Mount</hi> Sion, <hi>the City of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, the heavenly</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and to an innumerable Company of Angels, to the general Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and Church of the Firſt-born which are written in Heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the Spirits of juſt Men made perfect, and to Jeſus the Mediator of the New Covenant, and to the Blood of Sprinkling, that ſpeaketh better Things than that of</hi> Abel. This is the Inheritance of the Redeemed of the moſt High, bleſſed be the Name of the Lord; let us reſt in Hope, till he bring us to Humility and Lowlineſs of Mind, that he may cloath us with heavenly Glory, according to his Promiſe, <hi>I will beautifie my Houſe with Glory, ſaith the Lord.</hi> This is the Portion of a poor People, that caſt down themſelves before the Lord, that he may lift them up, and be all in all to them, in whoſe bleſſed <hi>Preſence they ſhall have Joy, and Rivers of Pleaſures at his Right hand for evermore.</hi>

This I have further to ſignify, that my Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture draws nigh. Bleſſed be my God. I am prepared, and I have nothing to do but die, and put off this corruptible and mortal Tabernacle, this Fleſh that hath ſo many Infirmities; but the Life that dwells in it, aſcends out of the Reach of Death, Hell, and the Grave; and Immortality and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life is my Crown for ever. Therefore you that are left behind, fear not, nor be diſcouraged, but go on in the Name and Power of the Lord, and bear a faithful and living Teſtimony for him in your Day.

            <p>Thus fervent in Spirit was <hi>W.

He was indeed a Man of a remarkable Zeal and Perception. He ſpoke ſometimes to young Lads as to Men, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them that the Bleſſing of the Lord would reſt upon them if they lived a godly Life; ſome of which being ſince come to Man's Eſtate, have experienced the Truth of his Saying.</p>

               <hi>Rebecca Travers</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted this Life, at about the Age of 79 Years. She was a Woman ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly well gifted; and ſpoke not only ſometimes in publick for Edification of the Church, but writ alſo ſeveral Books for the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Piety; in one of which ſhe ſignified, <hi>That tho' ſhe had been a Reader of the Scriptures from a Child of ſix Years old; yet when by the Power of the eternal Goſpel ſhe was turned from Darkneſs to Light, the Scriptures then became much more plain to her, as not wanting Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> She was an excellent open-hearted Woman, and took great Care
<pb n="597" facs="unknown:003104_0608_0FEFF9318E5AC630"/>of the Poor: She had ſeveral Times been impriſoned for Religion, but perſevered conſtantly in the Faith, and ſo piouſly entred into eternal Reſt.</p>
            <p>As to State Affairs, there now appeared a wonderful Agitation in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> ſince it was reported that the Queen was big with Child. And the Endeavours for introducing Popery, beſides the incroaching upon ſome Rights and Privileges, cauſed ſuch a Stir, that <hi>William</hi> the Third, Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and <hi>Stadholder</hi> (or Lord-Deputy) of <hi>Holland,</hi> &amp;c. was intreated and invited by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants to come to their Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.<note place="margin">The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> lands in <hi>England.</hi>
               </note> This at length he did, and came over with a Fleet, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Number of Forces. What was the Iſſue of this Expedition, is very amply deſcribed by other Pens, and alſo not properly my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince to relate; wherefore I think it ſufficient to my Purpoſe to ſay, that the Prince, after ſome Difficulty at Sea, came into <hi>England,</hi> where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving many Adherents, the King, many of whoſe Forces deſerted him, reſolved to go to <hi>France,</hi>
               <note place="margin">And K. <hi>James</hi> in <hi>France.</hi>
               </note> whither the Queen with the young Child was gone ſome Time before. Accordingly he went over, where he was well received by the <hi>French</hi> King, who provided him a Court at St. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains.</hi> In the mean while the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> came to <hi>London,</hi> and was ſaluted there by the Great Ones as the Deliverer of <hi>England.</hi> The Lord Mayor of the ſaid City, with the Aldermen, and the Sheriffs, having congratulated him, the Prince ſent for ſome of the Members of former Parliaments to come to him,<note place="margin">The Prince adviſes with Members of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments how to purſue the Ends of his Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

            </p>
            <p>In anſwer to this, Thanks were given to the Prince for his Care and Pains in Defence of the People, their Religion and Laws. And all Things took a favourable Turn for him.</p>

Not long after he called a <hi>Convention</hi> of the Commons; for a Parliament it could not be named, ſince in <hi>England,</hi> none but a King has Power to call a Parliament. In the mean while the Prince had cauſed the Princeſs his Conſort to come over from <hi>Holland</hi> into <hi>England;</hi> and at length the Convention, after many great Debates, came to this Reſolution, That the Throne was <hi>vacant;</hi> the Conſequence of which was, that the Prince and Princeſs of <hi>Orange,</hi>

A large Relation thereof is to be found in ſeveral Books. By the way I'll only ſay, that the Coronation was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> having refuſed to act in that Solemnity; at the Performance of which, the King and Queen were asked by the Biſhop, <hi>Will you ſolemnly promiſe and ſwear to govern the People of this Kingdom of</hi> England, <hi>and the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions thereto belonging, according to the Statutes in Parliament agreed to, and the Laws and Cuſtoms of the ſame.</hi> To which the King and Queen having anſwered, <hi>I ſolemnly promiſe ſo to do;</hi> the Biſhop asked, <hi>Will you to your Power cauſe Law and Juſtice in Mercy to be executed in all your Judgments?</hi> Anſwer was made, <hi>I will.</hi> The next Queſtion was, <hi>Will you to the utmoſt of your Power maintain the Law of God, the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Goſpel, and the Proteſtant Reformed Religion eſtabliſhed by Law?

And when he hath pleaſed, how hath he quieted the ſharpeſt Storms, and turned back the greateſt Floods and Torrents of Perſecution that ever you met? And how hath he confounded his and your Enemies, and brought Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon the Heads of them that ſought your Hurt? Were not theſe Things wrought by the Power of God?

If not, then let God have the Glory, and acknowledge to his Praiſe, Theſe have been the Lord's Doings, and are marvellous in our Eyes.</p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>Dear Friends,</hi> conſider how the wicked One hath wrought in a Myſtery among your ſelves, to ſcatter you, and to lay you waſte from being a People as at this Day; how many ſeveral Ways hath he tried, raiſing up Men of perverſe Minds, to ſubvert, and to turn you from the Faith, and from the Simplicity that is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, and to ſeparate you from that inviſible Power that hath been your Strength, and to ſeparate you one from another, and by ſubtile Wiles, to lead you into a falſe Liberty above the Croſs of Chriſt; and ſometimes by ſowing Seeds of <hi>Hereſy</hi> and <hi>Seditions,</hi> endeavouring to corrupt the Minds of whom they could with pernicious Principles; but oh, how have their Deſigns been fruſtrated, and the Authors thereof confounded and brought to nought! And how have you been preſerved as a Flock under the Hand of a careful Shepherd, even unto this Day, which mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters great Cauſe of Thankſgiving unto all the Faithful, who have witneſſed the Working of this preſerving Power in their own Particulars.</p>
                  <p>Alſo, <hi>My Friends,</hi> it is worth your Conſiderations, to behold how that by this inviſible Power, ſo many faithful Watchmen are raiſed up upon the Walls of your <hi>Zion,</hi> that in moſt of your Meetings there be Men and Women, upon whom God hath laid a Concern to be taking Care for the Good of the Whole, and to take the Overſight upon them, to ſee all Things kept in good and decent Order, and to make due Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for the comforting and relieving the Neceſſities of the Needy and Diſtreſſed, that nothing be lacking to make your Way comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and theſe have not been, nor are brought under this Charge by any Act of yours, but God hath raiſed up <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Teachers, Elders</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> of his own Election and Choice, and bowed their Spirits to take upon them the Work and Service to which they are appointed, for the Lord's-ſake, and for the Body's-ſake, which is the Church, to whom it may truly be ſaid, as in <hi>Acts</hi> xx. 28. <hi>Take ye heed to the Flock of God, over which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you Overſeers,</hi> &amp;c. And ſuch ought to be hearkned to in the Diſcharge of their Truſt, as thoſe that muſt give an Account to him that called them, and gifted them for their ſeveral Works and Services in the Church.</p>
                  <p>And by theſe Ways and Means hath the Lord eſtabliſhed among you a heavenly Government, and built as it were a Hedge about you, that ye may be preſerved from Generation to Generation, a People fitted for the Glory that is, and ſhall daily more and more be revealed among and upon the Faithful, who delight in that Power that called them to be Saints, and to bear a Profeſſion for the holy Name of God againſt the many Names and Ways that Men in their changeable Minds have ſet up, that the Name of the Lord alone may be exalted.</p>
                  <p>And, <hi>dear Friends</hi> and <hi>Brethren,</hi> I intreat you, that the Conſideration of theſe great and weighty Things which God hath wrought for you,
<pb n="603" facs="unknown:003104_0614_0FEFF93A29299130"/>and among you, may have that deep and weighty Influence upon your Souls, that ye may find your ſelves engaged to anſwer the Love and Mercy of God in your Lives and Converſations, and in all you have to do in this World, that ye may ſhew forth the Honour of God in all Things, that the Light which hath ſhined in you, may ſhine forth thro' you unto others, who yet ſit in Darkneſs; that all Men may know by your innocent and harmleſs Converſations, and by your cloſe keeping to the Lord, that ye are a People who are aſſiſted and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a ſupernatural Power, which governs your Wills, and ſubjects them to his bleſſed Will, and that guides and orders your Affections, and ſets them upon heavenly and divine Objects, and that gives you Power to deny your own private Intereſts, where they happen to ſtand in Competition with the Intereſt of Truth; for theſe and theſe only, will be found the true Diſciples of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who can deny themſelves, take up a Croſs daily, and follow him in the Guidance of his regenerating Power, which brings Death upon Self, and crucifies the old Nature, with its Affections and Luſts, and raiſeth up a Birth in you, that hath a holy Will, and Deſire to ſerve the Lord, and do his Will in the Earth; and ſuch as theſe are Inſtruments in the Hand of God for him to work by, and to do Works of Righteouſneſs, of Juſtice, of Charity, and all other the Virtues belonging to a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Life, to the Honour of God, and for the Comfort and Benefit of his Church and People.
And all you, <hi>dear Friends,</hi> upon whom the Lord hath laid a Care for his Honour, and for the Proſperity of the Truth, and gathered you into the good Order of the Goſpel, to meet together to manage the Affairs thereof; take Heed that ye have a ſingle Eye to the Lord, to do the Lord's Buſineſs in the Leadings of his Spirit, which is but one, and brings all (that are given up to be governed by it) to be of one Mind and Heart, at leaſt in the general Purpoſe and Service of thoſe Meetings; altho' thro' the Diverſity of Exerciſes, and the ſeveral Degrees of Growth among the Brethren, every one may not ſee or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand alike in every Matter, at the firſt propounding of it; yet this makes no Breach of the Unity, nor hinders the Brotherly-kindneſs, but puts you often upon an Exerciſe, and an inward travelling to feel the pure peaceable Wiſdom that is from above, to open among you, and every one's Ear is open to it, in whomſoever it ſpeaks, and thereby a Senſe of Life is given in the Meeting, to which all that are of a ſimple and tender Mind, join and agree: But if any among you ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary minded in the Management of ſome outward Affair, relating to the Truth, this doth not preſently break the Unity that ye have in Chriſt, nor ſhould weaken the brotherly Love, ſo long as he keeps waiting for an Underſtanding from God, to be gathered into the ſame Senſe with you, and walks with you according to the Law of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſuch a one ought to be born with, and cheriſhed, and the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of your Souls will go up to God for him, that God may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal it to him, if it be his Will, that ſo no Difference may be in Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, ſo far as is neceſſary for the Good of the Church, no more than there is in Matters of Faith and Obedience to God; For, <hi>My Friends,</hi> it is not of abſolute Neceſſity that every Member of the Church ſhould have the ſame Meaſure of Underſtanding in all Things; for then where were the Duty of the Strong bearing with the Weak? Then where were the Brother of low Degree? Where would be any ſubmitting to them that were ſet over others in the Lord, which all tend to the preſerving Unity in the Church, notwithſtanding the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Meaſures, and different Growths of the Members thereof; for as the Spirits of the Prophets are ſubject to the Prophets, ſo are the
<pb n="604" facs="unknown:003104_0615_0FEFF8F70523CBC0"/>Spirits of all that are kept in a true Subjection to the Spirit of Life in themſelves, kept in the ſame Subjection to the Senſe of Life given by the ſame Spirit in the Church; and by this Means we come to know the one Maſter, even Chriſt, and have no Room for other Maſters in the Maſter of our Obedience to God; and while every one keeps in this true Subjection, the ſweet Concord is known, and the Oil is not only upon <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Head, but it reacheth the Skirts of his Garment alſo; and Things are kept ſweet and ſavoury, and ye love one another from the greateſt to the leaſt in Sincerity, and (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>without Diſſimulation;</hi> and this Love excludes all <hi>Whiſperings of evil Things;</hi> all <hi>Back-biting, Tale-bearing, Grudgings,</hi> and <hi>Murmurings;</hi> and keeps Friends Minds clean one towards another, waiting for every Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to do each other Good, and to preſerve each others Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and their Hearts are comforted at the Sight of one another; and in all their Affairs, both relating to the Church, and to the World, they will be watchful over their own Spirits, and keep in the Lord's Power, over that Nature and Ground in themſelves that would be apt to take an Offence, or conſtrue any Word or Action to a worſe Senſe than the Simplicity thereof, or the Intention of the other concerned will allow of.</p>
                  <p>And whereas it may often fall out, that among a great many, ſome may have a different Apprehenſion of a Matter from the reſt of their Brethren, eſpecially in outward or temporal Things, there ought to be a Chriſtian Liberty maintained for ſuch to expreſs their Senſe, with Freedom of Mind, or elſe they will go away burden'd; whereas if they ſpeak their Minds freely, and a friendly and Chriſtian Conference be admitted thereupon, they may be eaſed, and oftentimes the different Apprehenſion of ſuch an one comes to be wholly removed, and his Underſtanding opened, to ſee as the reſt ſee; for the Danger in Society doth not lie ſo much in that, that ſome few may have a differing Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion in ſome Things from the general Senſe, as it doth in this; namely, when ſuch that ſo differ do ſuffer themſelves to be led out of the Bond of Charity, and ſhall labour to impoſe their private Senſe upon the reſt of their Brethren, and to be offended and angry if it be not received, this is the Seed of Sedition and Strife that hath grown up in too too many, to their own Hurt.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, <hi>my dear Friends,</hi> beware of it, and ſeek not to drive a Matter on in Fierceneſs or in Anger, nor to take Offence into your Minds at any Time, becauſe what ſeems to be clear to you is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently received; but let all Things in the Church be propounded with an awful Reverence of him that is the Head and Life of it; who hath ſaid, <hi>Where two or three are met in my Name, I will be in the Midſt of them:</hi> And ſo he is, and may be felt by all who keep in his Spirit; but he that follows his own Spirit, ſees nothing as he ought to ſee it. Therefore let all beware of their own Spirits and natural Tempers, (as they are ſometimes called) but let all keep in a gracious Temper, then are ye fit for the Service of the Houſe of God, whoſe Houſe ye are, as ye keep upon the Foundation that God hath laid; and he will build you up, and teach you how to build up one another in him, and as every Member muſt feel Life in themſelves, and all from one Head; this Life will not hurt it ſelf in any, but be tender of the Life in all; for by this one Life of the WORD ye were begotten, and by it ye are nouriſhed, and made to grow into your ſeveral Services in the Church of God; it is no Man's Learning, nor artificial Acquirement<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Oh <hi>Friends!</hi> great is the Work the Lord hath called you to, and is a fitting you for, who innocently wait upon him; and the Lord hath opened my Heart unto you, and laid it upon me to exhort and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech to have a Care that ye quit your ſelves as ye ought, in what God requires of ye; and for the more particular expreſſing what lies before me in the Matter, I ſhall ſet down a few particular Observations for your Benefit and Advantage; and my Soul's Deſire is, that my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of Love may have a good Effect in all your Boſoms, that God may be honoured thereby. And, Friends, ye know the chief Buſineſs, to which ye are called in your particular Men and Women's Meetings, is under theſe two Heads, Juſtice and Charity; the firſt, to ſee that every one hath Right done him, and the other to take Care there be nothing lacking to the Comfort of the Poor that are made Partakers of the ſame Faith with you.</p>
                  <p>And when ye meet about theſe Things, keep the Lord in your Eye, and wait to feel his Power to guide and direct you, to ſpeak and behave your ſelves in the Church of God, as becomes the peaceable Goſpel: And beware of all Brittleneſs of Spirit, and ſharp Reflection upon each others Words; for that will kindle up Heats, and create a falſe Fire, and when one takes a Liberty of a ſharp Word ſpoken out of the true Fear and Tenderneſs, it oftentimes becomes a Temptation to another; and if he hath not a great Care, it will draw him out alſo, and then the firſt is guilty of two Evils, firſt being led into a Temptation, and then ſecondly, he becomes a Tempter to others; therefore all had need be upon their Watch, neither to tempt, nor be tempted; and let none think it a ſufficient Excuſe for them that they were provoked; for we are as anſwerable to God for every evil Word ſpoken upon Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, as without Provocation; for, for that End hath the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed his Power to us, to keep and preſerve us in his Fear and Counſel in the Time of our Provocations; and therefore if any Man thro' Want of Watchfulneſs, ſhould be overtaken with Heat or Paſſion, <hi>a ſoft Anſwer appeaſeth Wrath,</hi> ſaith the wife Man; and therefore ſuch a Time is fitteſt for a ſoft Anſwer, leſt the Enemy prevail on any to their Hurt, and to the Grief and Trouble of their Brethren; for it is the proper Duty of Watchmen and Overſeers, to ſpare the Flock, that is, let nothing come nigh them that will hurt them, and wound and grieve them: Nay, the good Apoſtle was ſo careful over the Flock of Believers, that if there were any doubtful Matters to be diſputed of, he would not have them that were weak in the Faith at ſuch Diſputes, much leſs ought they that are weak to ſee thoſe that are ſtrong deſcend from their Strength, and go into the Weakneſs where they are not able to bear, for that is certainly the weak that cannot bear; thoſe that really live in the Strength and Power, they can bear even Burdens for</p>

them that cannot bear their own. The Apoſtle in the Place before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, when he ſent for the Elders of <hi>Epheſus</hi> to <hi>Miletus,</hi> and leſt a Charge with them, before he ſaid, <hi>Take heed to the Flock of God;</hi> he ſaid, <hi>Take ye heed to your ſelves:</hi> And indeed we are none of us like to diſcharge our ſelves well towards others, but by taking heed to our ſelves, to be kept in that ſober innocent Frame of Spirit, which the Truth calls for.</p>
                  <p>In the next Place, <hi>My dear Friends,</hi> when ye are called upon in Point of Juſtice, to give a Sentence of Right between Friend and Friend, take heed that neither Party get Poſſeſſion of your Spirit aforehand, by any Way or Means whatſoever, or obtain any Word or Sentence from you in the Abſence of the other Party, he not being yet heard: There is nothing more comely among Men than impartial Judgment; Judgment is a Seat, where neither Intereſt nor Affection, nor former Kindneſſes may come; we may make no Difference of the Worthineſs or Unworthineſs of Perſons in Judgment, as we may in Charity; but in Judgment, if a good Man, being miſtaken, hath a bad Cauſe, or a bad Man a good Cauſe, according to his Cauſe muſt he have Sentence: It was a good Saying, <hi>He that judgeth among Men, judgeth for the Lord, and he will repay it.</hi> Therefore let all be done as unto the Lord, and as ye are willing to anſwer it in his Preſence; and altho' ſome may for a Time be diſcontent thereat, yet in Time God ſhall clear up your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency as the Sun at Noon-day; and they that kick at ſound Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will find but hard Work of it, they do but kick againſt that which will prick them; and however ſuch, thro' their Wilfulneſs, and their abounding in their own Senſe may hurt themſelves, yet you will be preſerved, and enjoy your Peace and Satisfaction in the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of your Conſciences in the Sight of God.</p>
                  <p>And as concerning practical <hi>Charity,</hi> ye know it's ſupported by Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality, and where Liberality ceaſeth, Charity waxeth cold, yea, ſo far ceaſeth; where there is no Contribution, there is no Diſtribution; where the one is ſparing, the other is ſparing; and therefore let every one nouriſh Charity in the Root, that is, keep a liberal Mind, a Heart that looks upon the Subſtance that is given him, as really beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him for the Support of Charity, as for the Support of his own Body; and where People are of this Mind, they will have a Care of keeping back any of God's Part, for he hath in all Ages in a moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Manner, eſpouſed the Cauſe of the Poor, the Widow, and Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and hath often ſignified by his Prophets and Miniſters, a ſpecial Charge upon rich Men that had this World's Goods, that they ſhould look to it that they were faithful Stewards of what they poſſeſs'd, and that they might be found in good Works, and might not ſuffer their Hearts ſo to cleave to uncertain Riches, as to neglect the Service God had given them the Things of this Life for, either to give them up when called for in a Teſtimony of his worthy Name, or to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate of them to thoſe that were in Neceſſity.</p>
                  <p>Now as concerning the Neceſſities of the Poor, there is great Need of Wiſdom, when ye meet together about that Affair; for as I ſaid before, tho' the Worthineſs or Unworthineſs of Perſons is not to be conſidered in Judgment, yet in this it is; and you will find ſome that God hath made poor, and ſome that have made themſelves poor, and ſome that others have made poor, which muſt all have their ſeveral Conſiderations, in which you ought to labour to be unanimous, and not one to be taken up with an Affection to one Perſon more than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but every one to love every one in the univerſal Spirit, and then to deal out that Love in the outward Manifeſtations thereof, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Meaſure that the Lord in his Wiſdom working in you ſhall meaſure forth to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="607" facs="unknown:003104_0618_0FEFF94097B8F3C8"/>And as to thoſe who by <hi>Sickneſs, Lameneſs, Age,</hi> or other Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, are brought into Poverty by the Hand of Providence; theſe are your peculiar Care, and Objects pointed out to you, to beſtow your Charity upon, for by them the Lord calls for it; for as the Earth is the Lord's, and the Fulneſs of it, he hath by his ſovereign Power com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in every Diſpenſation, that a Part of what we enjoy from him, ſhould be thus employed: The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were not to reap the Corners of their Fields, nor to gather the Gleanings of the Corn nor Vintage, it was for the Poor; and in the Time of the Goſpel they were to lay apart, on the <hi>Firſt-day</hi> of the Week, a Part of what God had bleſſed them with, for the Relief of thoſe that were in Neceſſity; nay, they did not confine themſelves in their Charity to their own Meetings, but had an univerſal Eye thro' the whole Church of Chriſt, and upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Occaſions, ſent their Benevolence to relieve the Saints at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in a Time of Need; and all that keep in the Guidance of the ſame univerſal Spirit, will make it their Buſineſs to be found in the ſame Practice of <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>good Works; To do Good, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, forget not,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle: So they that forget not this <hi>Chriſtian Duty,</hi> will find out the Poors Part in the Corners and Glean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Profits of their Trades and Merchandizings, as well as the old <hi>Iſraelite</hi> did the Corners and Gleanings of his Field; and in the Diſtribution of it, will have a Regard to comfort the Bowels of ſuch, who are by the divine Providence of God put out of a Capacity of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying thoſe outward Comforts of Health, and Strength, and Plenty, which others do enjoy; for while they are Partakers of the ſame Faith, and walk in the Way of Righteouſneſs with you, ſubmitting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves patiently to the Diſpenſation of God's Providence towards them, they are of your Houſhold, and under your Care, both to viſit, and to relieve as Members of one Body, of which Chriſt Jeſus is Head; and he that giveth to ſuch Poor, lendeth to the Lord, and he will repay it.</p>
                  <p>But there is another Sort of Poor, who make themſelves poor thro' their Sloth and Careleſsneſs, and ſometimes by their Wilfulneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heady and high-minded, and taking Things in Hand that are more than they can manage, and make a Flouriſh for a Seaſon, and then thro' their own Neglects, are plunged down into great Poverty: Theſe are a Sort the Primitive Churches began to be troubled withal in the early Days of the Goſpel; for the Apoſtle took Notice of ſome that would not work at all, and ſharply reproved them, and ſaid, <hi>They that would not work ſhould not eat;</hi> and theſe are commonly a Sort of Buſy-bodies, and Meddlers with others Matters, while they neglect their own, and run into a worſe Way than the Unbelievers, while they profeſs to be Believers, yet do not take a due Care for thoſe of their own Houſhold.</p>
                  <p>The Charity that is proper to ſuch, is to give them Admonition and Reproof, and to convince them of their Sloth and Negligence; and if they ſubmit to your Reproof, and are willing to amend, then Care ought to be taken to help them into a Way and Means to ſupport themſelves; and ſometimes by a little Help in this Kind, ſome have been reclaimed from the Snares of their Soul's Enemy: But if they will not receive your wholſome Counſel and Admonitions, but kick againſt it, either in their Words or Actions, Friends will be clear of ſuch in the Sight of God; for it is unreaſonable to feed them that will not be ruled by you; they break the Obligation of Society by their diſorderly walking; for our Communion doth not ſtand only in fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting Meetings, and hearing Truth preached, but in anſwering the bleſſed Principle of Truth, in Life and Converſation, and therein both the Rich and the Poor have Fellowſhip one with another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="608" facs="unknown:003104_0619_0FEFF8FBA473DD08"/>There is another Sort that are made poor by the Oppreſſions and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties of others. Theſe oppreſſed Poor cry loud in the Ears of the Almighty, and he will in his own Time avenge their Cauſe; but in the mean Time there is a Tenderneſs to be extended to them, not knowing how ſoon it may be our Turn, and if there be Need of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and Advice, or if any Applications can be made to any that are able to deliver them from the Oppreſſors, in ſuch Caſes let all that are capable be ready and willing to adviſe, relieve and help the Diſtreſſed; and this is an acceptable Work of Charity, and a great Comfort to ſuch in their ſharp Afflictions, and their Souls will bleſs the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Eaſe and Comfort.</p>
                  <p>And, <hi>My dear Friends,</hi> as God hath honoured you with ſo high and holy a Calling, to be his Servants and Workmen in this his great and notable Day, and to work together in his Power, in ſetting forth his Praiſe and Glory in the Earth, and gathering together in one the ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Seed in this and other Nations: Oh, let the Dignity of your Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing provoke and encourage you to be diligent Attenders upon his Work and Service you are called to, and let not your Concerns in the World draw you from obſerving the Times and Seaſons appointed to meet together; but you that are Elder, ſet a good Example to the younger Sort, by a due Obſervation of the Hour appointed, that they that come firſt one Time, may not by their long Staying for others be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, ſo as perhaps they may be laſt another Time; but when the Time is come, leave your Buſineſs for the Lord's Work, and he will take Care your Buſineſs ſhall not ſuffer, but will add a Bleſſing upon it, which will do more for you than the Time can do that may be ſaved out of his Service.</p>

               </note> about the Beginning of which, <hi>G. Fox</hi> departed this Life, who even in the laſt Period thereof writ much, and continued la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious without fainting. The laſt Epiſtle I find of his, was to his Friends and Brethren in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who becauſe of the Revolution and Troubles there, ſuffered much, chiefly as I think by the Papiſts; and therefore in the ſaid Epiſtle he exhorted his Friends to Stedfaſtneſs: This was in the Month called <hi>January;</hi> and the next Day, being the firſt of the Week, and the 11th of the ſaid Month, he went to the Meeting at <hi>Grace-church-ſtreet,</hi> where he preached very effectually, treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of many Things with great Power and Clearneſs; and concluded with a Prayer. After which, the Meeting ending, he went to <hi>Henry Gouldney</hi>'s in <hi>White-Hart-Court,</hi> near the Meeting-houſe, where he ſaid to ſome that came with him, <hi>He thought he felt the Cold ſtrike to his Heart, as he came out of the Meeting.</hi> Yet added, <hi>I am glad I was here. Now I am clear, I am fully clear.</hi> When thoſe Friends that were with him, were withdrawn, he lay down in his Clothes upon a Bed, but ſoon roſe again; yet after a little Time he lay down again, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining ſtill of Cold; and his Strength decaying, he not long after undreſs'd, and went to Bed; where he lay in much Contentment and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation, continuing very ſenſible to the laſt. His Diſtemper increaſing, and perhaps perceiving that his End was at Hand, he recommended the ſpreading of Books (containing the Doctrine of Truth) to ſome of his Friends, that came to him after having been ſent for. And to ſome others who came to viſit him in his Illneſs, he ſaid, <hi>All is well, the Seed of God reigns over all, and over Death it ſelf. And tho'</hi> (continued he) <hi>I am weak in Body, yet the Power of God is over all, and the Seed reigns over all diſorderly Spirits.</hi> He uſed often, even in his Preaching, when he ſpoke of Chriſt, to call him <hi>the Seed;</hi> wherefore thoſe that were with him, very well knew what he meant when he ſpoke of the Seed. Thus he lay in a heavenly Frame of Mind, and his Spirit being wholly exerciſed towards the Lord, he grew weaker and weaker in Body, until on the third Day of the Week, and of his Sickneſs alſo, he piouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted this Life. About four or five Hours before, being asked, <hi>How he
<pb n="610" facs="unknown:003104_0621_0FEFF8FE0050B040"/>did,</hi> he anſwered, <hi>Don't heed, The Power of the Lord is above all Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Death; the Seed reigns, bleſſed be the Lord.</hi> And thus triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over Death, he departed from hence in Peace, and ſlept ſweetly on the 13th of the Month anciently called <hi>January,</hi> (for being as a Door or Entrance into the New Year) about ten a-clock at Night, in the 67th Year of his Age. His Body was buried near <hi>Bunhill-Fields</hi> on the 16th of the ſaid Month, the Corps being accompanied by great Numbers of his Friends, and of other People alſo: For tho' he had had many Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, yet he had made himſelf alſo beloved of many. He was tall of Stature, and pretty big-bodied, yet very moderate in Meat and Drink; neither did he yield much to Sleep. He was a Man of a deep Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and of a diſcerning Spirit; and tho' his Words were not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways link'd together by a neat Grammatical Connexion, and that his Speech ſometimes ſeemed abrupt, as with a kind of Gap; yet he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd himſelf intelligently, and what was wanting in human Wiſdom, was abundantly ſupplied with Heavenly Knowledge. He was of a quick Apprehenſion; and tho' his Wit was not poliſhed by humane Arts, yet he was ingenious; and in his Prayers (which generally were not very long, tho' powerful) appeared a decent Gravity, mix'd with an awful Reverence, to Admiration. His Qualities are at large ſet forth by <hi>Thomas Elwood,</hi> an eminent Author, who having much converſed with him,<note place="margin">His Character by <hi>T. Elwood.</hi>
               </note> gave the following Character of him. <q>He was indeed an heavenly-minded Man, zealous for the Name of the Lord, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd the Honour of God before all Things. He was valiant for the Truth, bold in aſſerting it, patient in ſuffering for it, unwearied in labouring in it, ſteady in his Teſtimony to it, immoveable as a Rock. Deep he was in divine Knowledge, clear in opening heavenly Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, plain and powerful in Preaching, fervent in Prayer. He was richly endued with Heavenly Wiſdom, quick in diſcerning, ſound in Judgment; able and ready in giving, diſcreet in keeping Counſel; a Lover of Righteouſneſs, an Encourager of Virtue, Juſtice, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Meekneſs, Purity, Chaſtity, Modeſty, Humility, Charity, and Self-denial in all, both by Word and Example. Graceful he was in Countenance, manly in Perſonage, grave in Geſture, courteous in Converſation, weighty in Communication, inſtructive in Diſcourſe, free from Affectation in Speech and Carriage. A ſevere Reprover of hard and obſtinate Sinners, a mild and gentle Admoniſher of ſuch as were tender and ſenſible of their Failings. Not apt to reſent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Wrongs, eaſie to forgive Injuries; but zealouſly earneſt, where the Honour of God, the Proſperity of Truth, the Peace of the Church were concerned. Very tender, compaſſionate, and pitiful he was to all that were under any ſort of Affliction; full of brotherly Love, full of fatherly Care: For indeed the Care of the Churches of Chriſt was daily upon him, the Proſperity and Peace whereof he ſtudiouſly ſought.</q> Yet more is ſaid of him to his Praiſe, both by the ſaid <hi>Tho. Elwood</hi> and others; but I will not detain my Reader any longer therewith. His Wife, about ſix Months before his Death, came to him at <hi>London,</hi> and being glad of his Health, which then was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than ſome Time before, ſhe, after ſome Stay in the ſaid City, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Home well ſatisfied, leaving him at <hi>London,</hi> where his general Service to the Church ſeem'd to be then moſt requiſite. After his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe an Epiſtle was found, which was writ with his own Hand, and left ſealed up with this Superſcription, <hi>Not to be opened before the Time.</hi> What this ſignified, ſeemed to be a Riddle; but he being now deceas'd, it was judged to be the Time to open this Letter, which was directed to his Friends, and was as followeth;</p>

                  <p>And now all Friends, all your Meetings, both Mens and Womens, Month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Quarterly, and Yearly, &amp;c. were ſet up by the Power, and Spirit, and Wiſdom of God; and in them you do know that you have felt both his Power, and Spirit, and Wiſdom, and bleſſed refreſhing Preſence among you, and in you, to his Praiſe and Glory, and your Comfort: So that you have been a <hi>City ſet on a Hill, that cannot be hid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And altho' many looſe and unruly Spirits have riſen betimes to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you and them, both in Print and otherways; but you have ſeen how they have come to nought; and the Lord hath blaſted them, and brought their Deeds to Light, and made them manifeſt to be the Trees without Fruit, and Wells without Water, and wandering Stars from the Firmament of God's Power, and the raging Waves of the Sea, caſting up their Mire and Dirt: And many of them are like the Dog turned to his old Vomit, and the Sow that was waſhed, turned again to the Mire. And this hath been the Condition of many, God knoweth, and his People.</p>
                  <p>And therefore all ſtand ſtedfaſt in Chriſt Jeſus your Head, in whom you are all one, Male and Female, and know his Government, and of the Encreaſe of his Government and Peace there ſhall be no End; but there will be an End of the Devil's, and of all them that be out of Chriſt, and do oppoſe it and him, whoſe Judgment doth not linger, and their Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation doth not ſlumber: And therefore in God and Chriſt's Light, Life, Spirit and Power live and walk, that is over all (and the Seed of it) in Love and in Innocency, and Simplicity; and in Righteouſneſs and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs dwell, and in his Power and Holy Ghoſt, in which God's Kingdom doth ſtand. All Children of New and Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that is from above, and is free, with all her Holy, Spiritual Children, To her keep your Eyes.</p>
                  <p>And as for this Spirit of Rebellion and Oppoſition, that hath riſen for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly and lately, it is out of the Kingdom of God and heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and is for Judgment and Condemnation, with all its Books, Words and Works. And therefore Friends are to live and walk in the Power and Spirit of God, that is over it, and in the Seed, that will bruiſe and break it to pieces: In which Seed you have Joy and Peace with God, and Power and Authority to judge it; and your Unity is in the Power and Spirit of God, that doth judge it; and all God's Witneſſes in his Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle go out againſt it, and always have and will.</p>
                  <p>And let no Man live to Self, but to the Lord, as they will die in him; and ſeek the Peace of the Church of Chriſt, and the Peace of all Men in him: for <hi>Bleſſed are the Peace-makers.</hi> And dwell in the pure, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, heavenly Wiſdom of God, that is gentle, and eaſie to be entreated, that is full of Mercy; all ſtriving to be of one Mind, Heart, Soul and Judgment in Chriſt, having his Mind and Spirit dwelling in you, build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up one another in the Love of God, which doth edifie the Body of Chriſt, his Church, who is the Holy Head thereof. So Glory to God thro' Chriſt, in this Age, and all other Ages, who is the Rock and Foundation,
<pb n="612" facs="unknown:003104_0623_0FEFF9005315F4B0"/>and the <hi>Emanuel,</hi> God with us, <hi>Amen,</hi> over all, the Beginning, and the Ending; in him live and walk, in whom you have Life Eternal, in whom you will feel me, and I you.</p>
                  <p>All Children of New <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that deſcends from above, the Holy City, which the Lord and the Lamb is the Light thereof, and is the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; in it they are born again of the Spirit: So <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that is above is the Mother of them that are born of the Spirit. And ſo they that come, and are come to heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> are them that receive Chriſt; and be giveth them Power to become the Sons of God, and are born again of the Spirit: So <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that is their Mother. And ſuch do come to Heavenly Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> and the innumerable Company of Angels, and to the Spirits of juſt Men made perfect; and are come to the Church of the Living God written in Heaven, and have the Name of God, and the City of God written upon them: So here is a New Mother, that bringeth forth a heavenly and a Spiritual Generation.</p>
                  <p>There is no Schiſm, nor Diviſon, nor Contention, nor Strife, in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> nor in the Body of Chriſt, which is made up of Living Stones, a Spiritual Houſe. And Chriſt is not divided, for in him there is Peace. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>in me you have Peace.</hi> And he is from above, and not of this World; but in the World below, in the Spirit of it there is Trouble: Therefore keep in Chriſt, and walk in him, <hi>Amen.</hi>

               </note> who being in <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> made a great Buſtle there. He was a witty Perſon, and eſteemed very learned; and at the Univerſity ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Degree of Maſter of Arts.

               </note> Baron of <hi>Helmont,</hi> concerning the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migration of Souls, became ſo Palatable to him, that he not only in ſome Manner approved it, but alſo was believed to be concerned in the Book containing two hundred Queries about that Matter, great Part of which, as I have been informed, he acknowledged to have been put in Writing by himſelf, tho' it appeared in Publick without the Author's Name. But this Notion meeting with no Acceptance among the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> his Love to them began to abate, and his Diſcontent increaſed, becauſe two Perſons, who oppoſed him, had, (as he ſaid) uſed ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable
<pb n="613" facs="unknown:003104_0624_0FEFF948735B8D70"/>Expreſſions, and were not ſo ſharply reproved, as he, who was of a fiery Temper, deſired. He accuſed them, that they had ſaid, <hi>That the Light within was ſufficient to Salvation, without any Thing elſe.</hi> From whence he endeavour'd to prove, that they excluded the Man Jeſus Chriſt, as not neceſſary to Salvation; but they denied this to be their Doctrine.<note place="margin">Differs with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Brethren in Pennſylvania.</note> He afterwards ſaid of <hi>William Stockdel,</hi> one of thoſe two Perſons at <hi>Philadelphia</hi> in <hi>Pennſylvania, That he had charged him</hi> G.

Keith</hi> blew the Fire of this Quarrel, and ſo got ſome Adherents. He alſo charged the Deputy-Governor <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Lloyd,</hi> to have ſaid, <hi>That Faith in Chriſt without us, as he died for our Sins, and roſe again, was not neceſſary to our Salvation.</hi> But others ſaid, that the Words were not ſo, and that the Matter was not fairly ſtated; ſince the Queſtion was not, <hi>Whether Faith in Chriſt without us, as he died for our Sins, and roſe again, was not neceſſary to our Salvation:</hi> But, <hi>Whether that Faith were indiſpenſably neceſſary to all Mankind, and that none could be ſaved without it, tho' they had not the Means, Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity or Capacity to know or receive it.</hi> Which being aſſerted, it was thought that ſuch a Poſition did not only exclude from Salvation whole Nations, but alſo Infants, and deaf and dumb Perſons.

And ſince now he began to behave himſelf very diſreſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and was on that Account ſharply reproved by the aforeſaid <hi>Tho. Lloyd,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Is reproachful to the Deputy-Governour, and ſlanders the Magiſtrates in Print.</note> he did not ſtick to ſpeak to him in a reproachful way, charging him with <hi>Impudence,</hi> and ſaying, <hi>That he was unfit to be a Governor, and that his Name ſhould ſtink,</hi> &amp;c. Now becauſe ſome Members of the Council did not expect to be better treated by him, ſince he had called one of the Magiſtrates <hi>impudent Raſcal,</hi> this was much reſented, and the more, becauſe <hi>G.

               </note> And now ſeeing ſeveral <hi>Mennonites</hi> of the County of <hi>Meurs</hi> lived alſo in <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> it was not much to be wonder'd, that they who count it unlawful for a Chriſtian to bear the Sword of Magiſtracy,<note place="margin">Is fixed for ſlandering the Magiſtrates, but the Fine not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted.</note> did ſtick to him; and to get Adherents ſeemed the main Thing he aimed at; for he himſelf was not train'd up under ſuch a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but in the Doctrine of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland.</hi> The Conſequence of this Caſe was, that <hi>Keith,</hi> and one <hi>Thomas Bud,</hi> who (with him) had been Compiler of the aforeſaid Paper,<note place="margin">And ſome time after comes again into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains to the Church at <hi>London.</hi>
               </note> were fined for it; but yet the Government was ſo moderate, that the Fine was never exacted: And for all that, G. <hi>Keith</hi> did not ſtick to make a great Clamour of his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; and about two Years after, he came into <hi>England,</hi> to make his Complaint to the Church at <hi>London.</hi>

                        <p>'TIS a certain Truth,<note place="margin">Thereupon <hi>T. Eccleſtone</hi> in their Behalf, gives the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of their Caſe.</note> that among Chriſtians, and Proteſtants eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, there are divers particular Things about Religion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcienciouſly ſcrupled by ſome as unlawful, that others eſteem ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox: And therefore it is not to be wondered, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> differ from many others (tho' not from all) in this Caſe of Oaths; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving they are abſolutely forbid to ſwear in any Caſe, by that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Command of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> v. 44. and the earneſt Exhortation of his Apoſtle, <hi>James</hi> v. 12. And that this is undeniably their Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Perſuaſion, is evidenced by their Sufferings theſe many Years for not Swearing.</p>
                        <p>And therefore their Caſe may be worth the charitable Notice of the Government, by Law to relieve them therein; and not for their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Perſuaſion, to continue them and their Families expoſed to Ruin, who among their Neighbours chearfully pay to the Support of the Government, and by their Trades and Induſtry (according to their Capacities) advance the national Stock.</p>
                        <p>It may therefore be humbly offered, That 'tis not the Intereſt of the Government to refuſe them Relief.</p>
                        <p>Their Induſtry in Trade, both at Sea and Land, bringing Profit to the Government, as well as others; the Station they ſtand in, as Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, Farmers, Manufactors, Improvers of Lands and Stocks, is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to their Neighbours as truly as others. And as it ſeems not the Intereſt of the Government in general, that they ſhould be any Ways diſcouraged in their honeſt Induſtry; ſo neither is it the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of an eminent Part of the Government, that they ſhould not be relieved, <hi>viz.</hi>
due Judges.</p>
                        <p>For the frequent Suits that are brought againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> before the Chancery and Exchequer Judges, are no do doubt very troubleſome and burdenſome, by the Difficulty of getting at a juſt Iſſue, for Want of Swearing; whereby Justice is delayed, and their Cauſes often held very long; and no doubt when juſt Judges ſee the <hi>Quakers</hi> wrong'd, and abuſed, and can't relieve them, 'tis irkſome to them: So that 'tis humbly conceiv'd, 'twould be a great Eaſe to thoſe Courts, to have the <hi>Quakers</hi> reliev'd in this Caſe of Oaths.</p>
                        <p>Neither is it without Advantage to the King's other Courts, to be able to uſe the Evidence of one who is now a <hi>Quaker,</hi> that perhaps
<pb n="624" facs="unknown:003104_0635_0FEFF912FA403B40"/>was not ſo,<note place="margin">1694</note> ſame Years ago; when he was a Witneſs to a Bill, Bond, Book-debt, or Deed of Indenture; or when he was Steward, or Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtee, or Servant, either to Perſons of Quality, or to others of Trade, or Eſtate.</p>
                        <p>Nor may their Teſtimony be unuſeful to Coroners, in Caſe of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Deaths; nor inconvenient in Caſes of Treſpaſs or Felony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And it is farther propoſed, That it is not the Intereſt of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to continue them unrelieved: For it is not the Intereſt of thoſe the <hi>Quakers</hi> are indebted to; becauſe, tho' ſuch may ſue and harraſs the <hi>Quakers</hi> in Perſon and Eſtate, yet they may long want a Deciſ
on of their Debt or Claim, as to the Right of it, for Want of an Anſwer upon Oath.</p>
                        <p>It is not the Intereſt of thoſe they are concerned with, in any doubtful Caſe, becauſe of the Difficulty to come to Trial.</p>
                        <p>And for thoſe that owe Money to the <hi>Quakers,</hi> to be allowed to fly into Chancery for a Refuge, to obſtruct paying juſt Debts, is ſuch an Injury, as 'tis hop'd, no one that is rational will countenance, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſhould be continued upon them. And may it nor then be aſſerted, that 'tis no honeſt Man's true and juſt Intereſt, (to have the <hi>Quakers</hi> denied Relief) no not the Gown-men of <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> whoſe few Fees from the <hi>Quakers,</hi> as Plaintiffs might ſuggeſt (tho' unduly) that they have no long tail'd Debts to ſue for, nor Titles to recover; but if they ſo ſuppoſe, it's a Miſtake, for 'tis rather their Deſpair or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and their well-known Inability to purſue a Cauſe, that is their common determent to begin.</p>
                        <p>So that of all Cauſes that croud thoſe Courts, few are brought by the <hi>Quakers,</hi> tho' they may need it as much as others, to the great Loſs of the Learned in the Law, as well as the poor injured <hi>Quaker.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And one might think 'twere great Pity an induſtrious People ſhould be kept liable to all injurious Suits, and ſo much barr'd from Suing for their Rights, be their Cauſe never ſo reaſonable, juſt or neceſſary.</p>
                        <p>Seeing their Relief is to them ſo needful, ſo harmleſs to all, and ſo uſeful to the Government, and their Neighbours; let's a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the common Objections, which may be ſum'd up in ſhort thus:</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>Firſt Objection, <hi>How ſhall we then be at a Certainty?</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>Secondly, <hi>Why ſhould the Laws be alter'd for them? For,</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>Thirdly, <hi>'Twould be to raze old Foundations.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>Fourthly, <hi>And let them into the Government.</hi>
                           </item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Which it's hoped will not be difficult to anſwer one by one, and that to reaſonable Satisfaction.</p>
                        <p>And to the firſt, <hi>viz. The Doubt of Certainty.</hi> It may be rationally affirmed, That whoſoever is bound to tell the Truth, (eſpecially againſt Mens own Intereſt, where the Temptation, if any, mainly lies) ſuch are either ſo bound by the Law of God, or the Laws of Men, or both.</p>
                        <p>Now the Obligations by the Law of God are binding on good Men, whether they give Anſwers on Oath, or on their ſolemn Affirmation in the Fear of God; and Knaves are only bound by the penal Laws of Men; which if made equally ſevere, to thoſe that give fallacious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, as well without Oath as by Oath, would be equally effectual and binding, both to them that give Anſwers without Swearing, and to them that Swear.</p>
                        <p>The Second Objection, <hi>That 'twould be an Alteration of the Law;</hi> Not of the Subſtance; of the Law, but of a Circumſtance; and if that hath no Detriment in it, but that the Alteration be really an Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a Conveniency to an honeſt, induſtrious People, pray why ſhould it not be done? What Seſſions of Parliament is there, that
<pb n="625" facs="unknown:003104_0636_0FEFF95590DB2F80"/>paſſes, but ſome Law or other is made for the Eaſe, Security, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Subject?</p>
                        <p>If Foreigners are too hard for our ſea-faring People, out goes an Act of Navigation to prevent it.</p>
                        <p>If our Poor at home want Silk to work with, how ſoon is it granted? (notwithſtanding the ſame Act) to come over Land, and not directly in Shipping from the Places of its Produce, as the ſaid Act before did enjoin: And ſhall the Eaſe of Trade be ſo ſoon granted againſt a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Statute; and the Eaſe of Conſcience be ſo long denied in this, as poſitive a Command of Chriſt, at leaſt really ſo believed and accepted?</p>
                        <p>And for the Third Objection, <hi>That 'tis to raze old Foundations.</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>No,</hi> as 'twas ſaid, 'tis rather to mend them; a proper Work for Parliaments.</p>
                        <p>Did not Parliaments abrogate Popery, with all its Claim of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity? Did not a Parliament make the Act of <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> againſt the Claim of Prerogative? And was it more reaſonable to ſecure the Subject from perpetual Impriſonment by a King, without Trial, than it is to ſecure one Subject from impriſoning another till Death, for not giving an Anſwer in Chancery, or Exchequer, upon Oath? Does it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Parliaments to ſecure other Subjects in their Eſtates, Liberties, and Properties? And is it unparliamentary, to ſecure the <hi>Quakers</hi> from Sequeſtrations againſt their whole Eſtates? becauſe they dare not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to a Circumſtance of the Law, when (as they underſtand it) 'tis againſt an expreſs Command of Chriſt? Surely no: And therefore their Relief in Parliament is a ſitting Caſe to be there tenderly taken Notice of, and provided for.</p>
                        <p>May it not then be well worth the While for this preſent Parliament, to relieve theſe diſtreſſed People, and afford their ſuffering Caſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs? That thereby their Cauſes may the ſooner come to an Iſſue; whether they ſue for juſt Debts, or are ſued; whereby many unjuſt and vexatious Suits, by injurious and litigious Perſons, may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, which have often tended rather to the <hi>Quakers</hi> Ruin, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Damage, than Recovery of their Right.</p>
                        <p>As to the Fourth Objection, <hi>That 'twill tend to let them into the Government:</hi> For Anſwer thereto, Bar that as hard as you pleaſe; only don't let the Suppoſal of that, from which ſo eaſily and ſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly they may be excluded, be a Hindrance to that Eaſe and Benefit the Government may ſo eaſily afford them.</p>
                        <p>But now while you have Opportunity by the Station Providence hath placed you in, pray be you of ſuch noble, generous Spirits, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them, tho' they differ from you in the Conſtruction of a Text they eſteem plain and poſitive on their Side, and from which they dare not ſwerve,<note place="margin">Chryſoſtom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Swinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by<hi>'s Appeal to the King.</hi>
                           </note> having therein the Concurrence of many ancient Fathers, and Martyrs, and ſince them the <hi>Menniſts,</hi> and of late <hi>Francis Osbourne,</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>Which no Man can rationally ſay, is only ſpoken of Swearing in Communication, for his Complaint is againſt juſtifying Swearing, and compelling Men to Swear, which cannot be pretended to mean other than ſolemn Swearing; for no Age, that we read of, did ever autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize profane Swearing, much leſs compel to it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="626" facs="unknown:003104_0637_0FEFF91527435C70"/>Since therefore not only profane Swearing, but alſo ſolemn Swearing was early complained of by Proteſtants, let it not ſeem ſtrange to any, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> now ſcruple Swearing, and for Eaſe therein have often ſought Relief in Parliament, the proper Place.</p>
                        <p>Seeing then they believe they have the Authority of Chriſt's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and the Apoſtle's Exhortation, and the Martyrs Doctrine on their Side; tho' divers of you, are not ſo perſuaded;</p>
                        <p>Yet let the World behold your Juſtice and Willingneſs (according to your Power) to do Good to all the honeſt and induſtrious People you both repreſent and govern; by enacting, <hi>That their Solemn Affirmation ſhall be accepted in Lieu of an Oath; and all that falſify therein, ſhall be puniſhed equally with perjured Perſons.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It having been made appear to a Committee of this Parliament, [<hi>Dec.</hi> 2. 1692] that they are expoſed to great Hardſhips, as aforeſaid; and not themſelves only, but others alſo; [which was the Caſe of a Member, or two of this preſent Parliament.]</p>
                        <p>So that upon the whole Matter, the ſaid Committee were of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and did report it to the Houſe, <hi>That the Quakers ought to be relieved according to the Prayer of their Petition,</hi> [then newly preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Houſe.]</p>
                        <p>Wherefore, as Liberty hath been given them to declare their Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to the Government without Swearing, for which Eaſe they are ſincerely thankful; ſo be pleaſed to add to that Kindneſs, their Relief in the Matter of Oaths, between them and other Subjects, as well as between the Government and them.</p>

            <p>Tho' after the delivering of the ſaid Repreſentation, the Parliament this Year came not to a full Reſolution for their Relief, yet ſeveral Members ſhewed themſelves more inclined to it, and in the next Year the Matter was taken in Hand again in good Earneſt.</p>
            <p>Toward the Concluſion of this Year,<note place="margin">The Death of Queen <hi>Mary.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Mary</hi> the Second, Queen of <hi>England,</hi> deceaſed: She was a Princeſs eminent beyond many, being well vers'd in Reading, and of a great Knowledge, of which I'll mention only this Paſſage,<note place="margin">The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ambaſſador at the <hi>Hague</hi> in vain endeavours to reconcile her to the Popiſh Religion.</note> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> That the Ambaſſador of the King her Father at the <hi>Hague,</hi> having tried by many Arguments to bring her over to the Papal Religion, ſaid afterwards in the Preſence of ſome great Men, <q>That he never before believed that a Woman was to be found any where ſo well experienced in the Doctrine of Chriſtian Religion; and that therefore he would not adviſe any to enter into Diſcourſe with her about that Matter.</q> On the 21ſt of <hi>December</hi> ſome Symptoms of the Small-pox appeared on the Queen, who had been ill a Day or two before; and her Diſtemper ſuddenly encreaſed to that Degree, that the Phyſicians began to deſpair of her Recovery; But this was ſo far from frighting her, that ſhe ſaid, <hi>God be thanked, I am prepared.</hi> And this Quietneſs of Mind did not leave her, even when ſhe felt Death approaching; for then ſhe was heard to ſay, <hi>I believe now that I ſhall die ſhortly; and I thank God, that from my Youth I have learned this true Doctrine, that Repentance ought not to be deferr'd to a Dying-Bed.</hi> In ſuch a Chriſtian Diſpoſition ſhe continued to her dying Hour, and ſo quietly gave up the Ghoſt to her Creator from whom ſhe had received it,<note place="margin">The King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly with her in the Time of her Sickneſs</note> departing at <hi>Kenſington</hi> not long after Mid-night, between the 26th and 27th of <hi>December,</hi> and leſt the King in unſpeakable Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, who, in all the Time of her Sickneſs, 'tis ſaid, had not departed

mong theſe alſo many of the vulgar Sort, who generally are ſickle and unſteady, and often inclined to Novelties; tho' <hi>Keith</hi> would as yet in ſome Reſpecct be look'd upon us an Adherent of the <hi>Quakers;</hi> he had alſo given ſorth in Print ſome Papers, wherein he endeavoured to make it appear that they held ſeveral heterodox Sentiments.</p>
            <p>The Books which he had publiſhed concerning this Matter,<note place="margin">His Charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwerd</note> were ſo fully anſwered by the <hi>Quakers,</hi> that he being at a Loſs to make a Reply to their Anſwers, pretended that he was not in a Condition to ſet the Preſs at Work, and bear the Charges of the Impreſsion. But that this was a ſrivolous Evaſion, was well known. Yet he, todoſome thing, fell upon another Project, and publiſhed an Advertiſement, that on the 11th of the Month called <hi>June,</hi> he would deſend his Charge a gainſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">e fummons u to meet at Tur. is-Hall, rich they pru-itially decline Reaſons read are</note> and therefore he ſummoned ſome of them to appear there at that Time, to anſwer for themſelves. He now beginning; to comply with the Epiſcopalians, had, as he ſaid afterwards, given notice of his Intention to the Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> who not having forbidden it, he grew the more bold. But the <hi>Quakers</hi> did not think Perſons might not have got together, and cauſed a dangerous Diſturb-ance. And therefore they declined to appear there, and gave the following Reaſons of their Refuſal, which were read in the appointed Meeting, and afterwards publiſhed in Print.</p>
            <q>
               <p>WHereas <hi>G. Keith</hi> hath,<note place="margin">Reaſons for not ineeting <hi>G. Keith</hi> at his Summons</note> after his wonted irregular and unruly Manner, challeng'd divers of us to defend our ſelves againſt ſuch Charges as he has to exhibit againſt us at <hi>Turners-Hall;</hi> Theſe are to certifie all whom it may concern, That the Reaſons why we decline any ſuch Meeting, are as follow;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the ſaid <hi>G. Keith</hi> has given us ſuch frequent Proofs of his very paſſionate and abuſie Behaviour, at the many more Select Meetings we have had with him, in all Manner of Sweetneſ s, Long-ſuffering and Patience, on our Side, to ſatisfie and preſerve him from theſe Extreams: That we cannot aſſure ourſelves now of any better Entertainment, or that the Meeting can have any deſirable Succeſs, for a thorough Information.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We decline to meet, becauſe it is not an agreed Meeting on both Sides, which it ought to have been; and where that is not, or can-not be adjuſted; the Preſs is the next ſair Way and Expedient, which he has begun with, and now ſeems to decline; nor hath he ſent us a Copy of his Charge or Indictment againſt us, which alſo he ought to have done.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That he has two of our Books which lie hard at his Door; in Vindication of us and our Doctrines from his Exceptions, and which he has not yet anſwered; ſo that he is not upon equal Terms with us; and therefore we think his Challenge, <hi>Appointment</hi> and <hi>Sumnous</hi> unſair; and that all that are not partial will be of the ſame Mind with us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Such <hi>publick</hi> and <hi>unlimited</hi> Meetings are too often attended with Heats, <hi>Levity</hi> and <hi>Confuſion,</hi> and anſwer not the End, deſired by ſober and enquiring Men. Beſides, that it lets up a Practice that Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity may judge to be an <hi>Abuſe</hi> to our Liberty and ſo draw that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Reſiectoin as no Friend to the Civil Peace.</p>

5. We know not what Religion or Perſuaſion this <hi>Wavering</hi> Man is of, or what Church or People he adhcres to, or will receive him, with his <hi>vain Sp
culations,</hi> that have led him to deſert us; nor who are accountable to us for him and his <hi>Irregularities</hi> and <hi>Abuſes;</hi> the generality of ſuch Aſſemblies uſually making ill Auditors, worſe Judges, and no good Security for our Satisfaction. And we muſt therefore take Leave to ſay, it ſeems to us an indirect Way of <hi>diſquieting</hi> and <hi>invading</hi> our preſent Liberty, that <hi>ſo irreligious a Meeting ſhould be held, whoſe End is to abuſe other Men for their Religion.</hi> If this ſhould be imitated by all the ſeveral Sorts of different Perſuaſions in this City, what Heats and Confuſions muſt neceſſarily enſue?</p>
               <p n="6">6. Wherefore, Laſtly, Be it known unto all, That <hi>for the ſake of Religion, the Liberty granted us, and the Civil-Peace,</hi> we decline to meet him; and not from any Apprchenſions we have of his Abilities, or our own Conſciouſneſs of Error, or Injuſtice to the ſaid <hi>G. Keith,</hi> whoſe weak and unbridled Temper we know is ſuch, that what Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Parts he hath, have not been able to ballance and ſupport him on leſs Occaſions, ſo that we may ſay they are in ill Hands; and if he procweds as he begins, they will be employed to an ill End, which his (poor Man!) cannot but be, unleſs he change his Courſe; which we heartily pray for, that a Place of Repentance he may find; and thro' a true Contrition, the Remiſſion of his great Sin on Envy, and evilly intreating the Lord's People and Way, which we profeſs, and which he the ſaid <hi>G. Keith</hi> hath long and lately both profeſſed, and zealouſly vindicated as ſuch.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Theſe Reaſons the <hi>Quakers,</hi> as hath been ſaid, publiſhed in Print, to ſhew the World, that it was not without a weighty Cauſe, that they did not accept <hi>G. Keith</hi>'s Summons. Now tho' <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> and <hi>W. Penn,</hi> for the above ſaid Reaſons did not appear in Turners-Hall, yet ſome of their Friends were there as Spectators, to ſee what would be the Iſſue of this Buſineſs. <hi>G. Keith</hi> ſeeing himſelf thus diſappointed in his Intention, took upon him for all that, to defend his Charge in the Abſence of his Adverſaries, which now he could do eaſily, ſince none con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted him, and he was applauded by the frequent Shoutings of the Mob that was there in great Numbers.<note place="margin">Which he oh-jects to very ſrieclouſly</note> After the Reaſons of Nonap pearance were read, Keith ſignified that they were not ſatisfactory, by calling them ſlender, weak and frivolous.<hi>What,</hi> ſaid he, may a Male factor make this Excuſe, <hi>You ſhall not call me before a Juſtice without my Conſent? If a man robs me, I may complain of him as a Robbrer, and without his Conſent call him to account. But here is a ſt range thing: If in juring Men may not be called to account without their Conſent, it will treſ paſs againſt the Law, and intrenches upon Liberty of Conſcience.</hi> This Reaſon he publiſhed in Print in his Narrative of that Day's Work. But who would formerly ever have thought that ſuch a little Man as he was, would have been ſo big. It look'd juſt as if the <hi>Quakers</hi> were obliged to appear as Malefactors before the pretended Judge <hi>Keith,</hi> ac companied with his Aſſiſtants the Mob, and I don't know who. And to keep to <hi>G. Keith's</hi> Companion, Tho' a Maleſactor may not ſay, <hi>You ſhall not call me before a Juſtice without my Conſent.</hi> yet with ſomc good Reaſon he might ſay, <hi>You ſhall not make yourſelf a Juſtice,</hi> as <hi>Keith</hi> now did. It is proable that he was ſupported by ſome great Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, otherwiſe ſuch a bold Action might caſily have turned to his Diſadvantage.</p>
            <p>My Limits do not admit of a circumſtanſtial Relation of what was tranſacted at that Time in <hi>Turnvers-Hall;</hi> yet to ſhew brieſly how he treated Matters, I'll produce one or two Inſtancen, by which my Reader
<pb n="634" facs="unknown:003104_0645_0FEFF9208ACB2730"/>
may know, <hi>ut ex unguc Leonem,</hi> and ſo judge of the reſt. He ſaid, he would charge the <hi>Quakers</hi> with nothing but what he could prove from their own Writings,<note place="margin">His abuſive Perverſion of G. W's Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings</note> and he went on thus:<hi>I offer to prove</hi> that G. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head <hi>hath denied Chriſt both to be God and Man.</hi> A ſtrange Thing in deed, ſince it was very well known that <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> had publiſhed a Book of above twenty Sheets, under this Title, <hi>The</hi> DIVINITY of CHRIST, <hi>and Unity of the Three that bear Record in Heaven, with the bleſſed End and Effect of Chriſt's Appearance coming in the Fleſh, Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Sacrifice for Sinners, confeſſed and vindicated by his Followers called</hi> Quakers. This Book <hi>G, Keith</hi> could not pretend Ignorance of, for he pick'd ſomewhat out of it an his Narrative. But to maintain his Charge, he appeal'd to a Book of <hi>G. Whitehead</hi>'s called, <hi>The Light and Life of Chriſt within.</hi> This Book <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> had written in Anſwer to <hi>W. Burnet,</hi> a <hi>Baptiſt</hi> Preacher, who writing of Chriſt ſaid, <hi>As he was God, he was Co-Creator with the Father, and ſo was'before</hi> Abraham, <hi>and had Glory with God before the world was, and in this Senſe came down from Heaven.</hi> To which <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> anſwered, <hi>What Nouſenſe and unſcripture-like Language is this, to tell of God being Co-Creator with the Father? Or that God had Glory with God? Doth not this imply two Gods, and that God had a Father? Let the Reader judge.</hi> Certainly it appcarſ from this plainly, that <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> did not intend any thing elſe but to cenſure the unſeriptural Expreſſions of his Antagoniſt, as <hi>Co-Creator,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. iii. 20. John x. 30</note> and implying two Gods: For not only the Apoſtle faith, <hi>God is one,</hi> but Chriſt himſelf faith, <hi>I and the Father are one.</hi> Yet <hi>G. Keith</hi> did not ſtick to ſay, G. Whitehead <hi>denieth the Divinity of Chriſt, and he deceives the Nation and theParliament, by telling them, The Quakers own Chriſt to be both God and Man, and-believe all that is recorded of him in the Holy Scripture.</hi> This he ſtrove to prove from a Paſſage taken out of the aforementioned Book, which in Senſe agreed with the former; and ſpeaking in another Page of the ſame Matter, viz. <hi>The</hi> Baptiſts <hi>calling God the Word, Co-Creator with the Father. G.Whitehead</hi> anſwers thus to it, <hi>To tell of the Word God, Co-Creator with the Father, is all one as to tell of God being Co-Creator with God, if the Father be God', and this is to make two Gods and two Creators: For God Co-Creator with the Father plainly implies two.</hi> Was this ſhewing of others their abſurd Expreſſions, a Denial that Chriſt was God, as <hi>Keith</hi> would have it? Might it not be asked here, whether the acute Wit of <hi>Keith</hi> was now altogether flown away? But a great; Part of his Auditory conſiſted of an ignorant Crew, and one or other of them was continually heard to cry out, <hi>It is ſufficient.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to prove that <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> had denied <hi>Chriſt to be Man, Keith</hi> cited from the forementioned Book, called, <hi>The Divinity of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. theſe Words, <hi>If the Body and Soul of the Son of God were both created, doth not this render him a fourth Perſon?</hi> Here <hi>Keith</hi> ſtopt, and broke off with an &amp;c. without adding the following Words; <hi>For Creation was in Time, which contradicts the Doctrine of three diſtinct, uncreated, Co-eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, Co-eſſential Perſons in the Deity, ſecing that which was ere 'ted, was not ſo.</hi> This <hi>G. Whitchead</hi> ask'd and ſaid to ſhew his Opponent <hi>T. Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſou</hi> the Abſurdity of his Aſſertions about the Perſonalities of the Deity. But <hi>Keith</hi> went on reading from <hi>G. Whitehead</hi>'s Book, thus, <hi>Where doth the Scripture ſay, That his Soul was created? For was not he the Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſs of the Father's Glory, and the expreſs Image of his divine Subſtance. But ſuppoſing the Soul of Chriſt was with the Body created in Time, &amp;c.</hi> Here <hi>Keith</hi> broke off again, omitting the following Words; <hi>I ask, if from Eternity he was a Perſon diſtinct from God and his holy Spirit, without either Soul or Body? Where doth the Scripture ſpeak of any Perſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either Soul or Body? Let's have plain Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="635" facs="unknown:003104_0646_0FEFF9650D143C70"/>Now tho' <hi>G.Wbitebead</hi> had written this to ſhew, how we often enter into inextricable Straits, when we do not keep to the Words of the holy Scripture, which qo where ſpeaks of <hi>Three Perſous in the Deity:</hi> Yet <hi>Keith</hi> perverting the Paſſage abuſively, ſaid to his Auditory, <hi>Here ye ſee he will not own that Chriſt had a created Soul.</hi> At this Rate and after this Manner <hi>Keith</hi> reaſoned, and treated the other Paſſages. But how ſmartly would he have carpt at others, if they had cited his Words thus piece-meal?</p>
            <p>But now he had a temporal Reward in his View; and ſeeing for that End he began more and more to declare himſelf in Favour of the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Church,<note place="margin">W. C. endra vours to ſhew Keith to be an Apoſtate in a very Reſpect</note> ſomebody of that Perſuaſion, who did no farther make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf known, than by theſe initial Letters W.C. made it his Buſineſs to ſhew the Changeableneſs of <hi>Keith</hi>'s Opinion and Sentiments from his own Writings, which he had publiſhed in Print, and there by evidently proved, that in every reſpect <hi>Keith</hi> was turned an Apoſtate, tho' he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared much offended at the <hi>Quakers,</hi> becauſe they had called him ſo: But ſaid this Author, <hi>If the</hi> Presbyterian <hi>Principles</hi> (of which Society <hi>Keith</hi> once was a Member) <hi>were better than the</hi> Quakers, <hi>then is Mr.</hi> Keith <hi>an Apoſtate, in revolting from and deſerting the</hi> Presbyterians <hi>and turning his Coat</hi> Quaker-<hi>faſhion. But if the</hi> Quakers <hi>were more in the Right than the</hi> Presbyterians, <hi>then</hi> e contra.</p>
            <p>Now he appeared to ſawn on the Epiſcopal Clergy,<note place="margin">G. K. by oppo-ſing the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> ſeems to hope for the beſt Recompence from the Epit copaliams</note> and eſtcemed law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful what formerly he had zealouſly oppugned. For he was in hopes that by oppoſing the <hi>Quakers,</hi> he ſhould be beſt rewarded among the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palians; and this was not altogether without Reaſon; for it being no more in their Power now to perſecute the <hi>Quakers</hi> in Manner as formerly, they made Uſe of other Means as much as poſſibly they could, to render them and their Dorine odious; for which <hi>Keith</hi> ſeemed to them no unſit Tool; for he being both of a witty and impetuous Temper, was alſo crafty, ſubtle, cunning, and violent in his Expreſſions. And to charge the <hi>Quakers</hi> with Inorthodoxy, he himſelf lanch'd into an he-torodox Sentiment: For it was believed, that for maintaining this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, <hi>That the Hiſtorical Knowledge of Chriſt's Sufferings, Death, Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, Lc. was abſolutely neceſſary for Salvation,</hi> he had no other Ground than the twelve pretended Tranſmigrations or Tranſitions of Man's Soul from one Body into another; becauſe the ignorant Souls from hence ſeemed to get Opportunity of being informed before the End of the World, concerning the Death and Reſurrection of our Saviour. Who would have imagined before,<note place="margin">He charges the <hi>Quakers</hi> with Inorthodoxy in Points he had formerly very notnbly defended. particularly a gainſt <hi>C. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
               </note> that this ſame G. Keith ſhould have accuſed the <hi>Quakers</hi> of Inorthodoxy in Point of Doctrine, which he had often ſo efſectually defended, and among the reſt in a Book againſt one <hi>Cotton Mather?</hi> wherein upon the Charge of their being guilty of many He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies and Blaſphemies, He ſaid after this Manner: <hi>Our Principles do mostly agree with the fundamental Articles of the Chriſtian Proteſtant Faith. According to my beſt Knowledge of the People called</hi> Quakers, <hi>and thoſe owned by them, as preachers and publiſhers of their Belief, being of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Eſteem among them, and worthy of double Honour; as there are many ſuch, I know none of them that are guilty of ſuch Hcreſies and Blaſphemies as they are charged with. And I think I ſhould know and do know thoſe called</hi> Quakers, <hi>havil been converſant with them in publick Meetings as well as in private Diſicourſes, with the moſt noted and eſtcemed among them, for about twenty-eight Years puſt, and that in many Plates of the World, both in</hi> Europe <hi>and</hi> America. Who would ever have thought then, that one who had converſed ſo many Years with the <hi>Quakers,</hi> preached their Doctrine, and deſended it publickly both by Writing and by Word of Mouth, ſhould afterwards have decried them, as Denicrs of the moſt eſſential Points of the Chriſtian Faith!

And ſince ſome others, ſuborned thereto, did not omit alſo to render the <hi>Quakers</hi> odious, as ſuch that held inorthodox Sentiments, theſe did not neglect to ſhew in Print, how they were injured and wronged. For now the old Tale, <hi>That there were Popiſh Emiſſaries among them,</hi> was revived and divulged anew. But it was no hard Matter for them to ſhew how ill-grounded this Conceit was; and therefore they might ſay, <hi>We are ſo well known to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, that if this were true, our Adverſaries would be very active to find out and diſcover ſuch Emiſſaries, ſince the Law againſt them is ſtiil in Force.</hi>

            <p>In this Year died of a Fever,<note place="margin">The Death of <hi>R. Haydock,</hi> and Character by <hi>Eleanor</hi> his Widow</note> 
               <hi>Roger Haydock,</hi> at his Houſe in <hi>Penketh</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> about the Age of fifty three Years. He had been in Holland the Year before, in which Time I had more than once Opportunity to ſpeak with him privately, and diſcovered thereby ſuch Chriſtian Qualities in him, that were indeed excellent; and therefore the News of his Deceaſe did much affect me; and becauſe of his Miniſtry, in which he was eminent, being more than ordinary full of Matter in his Preaching, his Death was much lamented among thoſe Churches in <hi>England</hi> where he had laboured moſt in the Goſpel. His Wife <hi>Eleanor</hi> in her Teſtimony concerning him ſaid, My Spirit hath been, and is bowed under, a deep Senſe of my great Loſs and Exerciſe in the Removal of my dear Husband, when it hath pleaſed God in his Wiſdom to take <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

who was Comfort to my Life, and Joy to my Days in this world, being given me of God, in great Mercy and loving Kindneſs; and ſo he hath been en joyed by me in Thankfulneſs of Heart, to the Cloſe of that Time God had appointed and now is taken from the Worlds with all its Troubles and Excreiſes, as alſo from all his labours and 'Travels, which were great amongſt the Churches of Chriſt, which with me have no ſmall Loſs in his Removal. But what ſhall ſay? Wiſe and good is the Lord, who doth what he will in Heaven and in Earth, and amongſt his Churches and his Choſen. He can break and bind up, wound and head, kill and make alive again, that the Living may ſee his Wonders, and magnify his 'Power in all, thro' all and over all, who is God eternal, bleſſed for ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then in her Teſtimony ſhe gives an Account of his Life, and how in her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> became her Husband. After a Description of his Life, and his many Travels in the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, to ediſy and build up the Churches, the ſaith alſo, That <hi>Tho' his Love to her was above all vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibles,</hi> as the beſt of Enjoyments he had in this World, yet ſhe was not too "dear to him to give up to ſerve the Truth of God. I was made (ſaith the) a Bleſſing to him, more comfortable every Day than other: He would often expreſs it; and truly ſo was he to me every Day, every Way, and in every Reſpect. No Tongue or Pen can relate the Full of that Comfort and Joy we had in God, and one in another. Tet we find ſuch hath been the Pleaſure of 'God concerning them he hath loved, to try them in the moſt near and dear Enjoyments, that it might be manifeſt he was loved ahovt, all; that no Gifts may be preſerved above the Giver; but that he may be all in all, who is, and is to come, God bleſſed for ever and ever. And truly there hath been great Care and Watchſulueſs one over another, and over our own Spirits, to ſee that our Love, tho' great, was bounded and kept within its Compaſs, the Truth being its Original, the Alpha and Omega alſo. Altho' it hath been the Pleaſure of God to try me, in the Removal of ſo great a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from me, ſure it is,, that I may be the more inward to him, and have his Love always in my Remembrance, who gives and takes away, and in till bleſs his Name. My Soul travels that I may always follow his Footſteps of Self-Denial in all Things, that 1 may finiſh my Courſe in this World, to the Glory of God, as he did, and have my Part in that Manſion of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>y with him eternal in the Heavens; tho' it may be my Lot to pay for a Time in this World of Troubles; yet I have Hope in Immortality and Eternal Bleſſedneſs, when Time in this World ſhall be no more. <hi>Thus Hie writ: But to ſhun Prolixity,, I break off. She then giving ſome further Account of his Life and Miniſtry, mentions, that being gone from home, ſhe was not preſent at his Death; but that they having taken Leave of each other before, had parted in great Love, with mutual Brewings to God for one another's Welfare: And ſhe concludes with theſe Words:</hi> Tho' I ſaw not his Going away, yet I have ſeen in what he went, that it was full of Zeal and Fervency in the Love of God, and Life of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. So in pure Submiſſion to the Will of God, I conclude this ſhort but true Relation of my worthy dear Husband, whoſe Name and Memorial is bleſſed, and will live, and be of a ſweet Savour in the Hearts of the Righteous thro' Ages. <hi>With ſuch a Tcſtimony it was that</hi> Eleanor <hi>tranſmitted the Memorial of her beloved Confort to Poſterity.</hi>

            <p>Meeting in this Year with no more remarkable Occurrences, I paſs over to that of 1697,<note place="margin">1697</note> in which a Treaty of Peace was concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>England,<note place="margin">Peace between England, France and Holland</note> France,</hi> and <hi>Holland;</hi> and tho' many thought it would be laſting, yet among the Popiſh Clergy there were thoſe that had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Opinion of it; of which this artificial Diſtich ſent over by a Clergyman from <hi>Ghent</hi> in <hi>Flanders to Holland,</hi> ſo that it fell firſt into my Hands, was an Evidence;</p>

                        <p>To prevent the Printing and publiſhing of Seditious or Treaſonable Books againſt the Government, and Scandalous Pamphlets tending to Vice and Immorality, is the wiſdom of all good Governments, and muſt be the Deſire of all good Men.</p>
                        <p>But to Limit Religious Books to a Licenſe, where the Tolerated Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions are many, they conceive, ſeems altogether unſafe to all, but that whoſe Opinion the Licenſer is of, who by this Bill hath Power to allow what he ſhall judge Sound and Orthodox, or reject what he ſhall conſtrue to be either Heretical, Seditious, or Offenſive.</p>
                        <p>Hiſtory and Experience have taught how the obſcure Term of Hereſy hath been turned and ſtretched againſt Primitive Chriſtians, Martyrs, and famous Reformers: Nor is it forgotten for what Reafons the Writ <hi>De Haeretico Comburendo</hi> was aboliſhed.</p>

                  <p>Be careful what Company you frequent; for a Man is commonly known by the Company he keeps, as much as by any one outward Thing; and of your Behaviour in Company; for I have found that a wife and ſober Deportment, adds much to a Man's Reputation and Credit in the World.</p>
                  <p>Watch to the Light, and its Diſcoveries of Good and Evil, that you may not be ignorant of Satan's Devices; ſo the Net will be ſpread in vain in the Sight of the Bird; for Watchfulneſs will make you in Love with a retired Eſtate; and the more truly and perfectly any Man knows and underſtands himſelf, the better diſcerning will ſuch have of other Men; as in the Beginning, when deep Silence of all Fleſh was more in Uſe, the Spirit of diſcerning was more common, and quicker, than ſince it hath been neglected; therefore be ſure you ſpend ſome Time (at convenient Seaſons) in waiting upon God in Silence, tho' it be diſpleaſing to the Fleſh; for I have had more Comfort, and Confirmation in the Truth, in my inward retiring in Silence, than from all Words I have heard from others, tho' I have often been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed by them alſo.</p>

                  <p>Keep conſtantly to Religious Meetings amongſt Friends; but look to your Aflections, that you reſpect not Perſons, but the Power and Life of Truth, from whomſoever it comes; not minding the Tickling of your Affections, but the Demonſtration of the Truth to your Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and Conſciences; for that will abide, when Flaſhes of Affections will fade and come to nothing, after the Words are ended.</p>
                  <p>Love one another truly, manifeſting your Love by good Counſel, and being helpful to each other upon all Occaſions; being good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to all you converſe with, eſpecially to your Children, and thoſe of your own Families, that Pride and Vanity may not be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced by you, but rather reproved; remembring, while they are under your Government, you muſt give an Account of the Diſcharge of your Duty to Gad towards them.</p>

By their powerful Way of Preaching Repentance many were awakened out of the Sleep of caredeſs Security, and came to ſee that their Covering was too ſhort, and that they were not clothed with the true Wedding-Garment: And many that had been of a rude Life, came to be ſo touched to the Heart by theſe zealous Preachers, that crying out, <hi>What ſhall we do to he ſaved?</hi> they were brought to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and Converſion; and ſo from wild and rough, came to be ſedate and ſober.

So that I ſaw the whole Courſe of Religion among us, was (for the moſt part) but a Talk to what they felt, enjoyed, poſſeſſed and lived in.</p>
                        <p>This Senſe made me ſick at Heart indeed, and ſet me upon deep crying to God, cloſe ſearching the Scriptures, and waiting on God, that I might receive the pure Senſe and Underſtanding of them, from and in the Light, and by the Help of his Spirit. (And what the Lord did beſlow on me in that State, with Thankfulneſs I remember before him at this very Day: For he was then my God and a Pitier and a Watcher over me; tho' he had not pleaſed then to direct me, how to ſtay my Mind upon him and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide with him.) And then I was led, (indeed I was led, I did not run of my ſelf) into a way of Separation from the Worſhip of the World, into a gathered Society: For this both the Scripture and the Spirit of God in me gave Teſtimony unto; and what we then met with, and what Leadings and Help we then felt, there is a Remembrance and Teſtimony in my Heart to this Day. But there was ſomewhat wanting, and we muſtook our Way: For whereas we ſhould have preſſed forward into the Spirit and Power, we can too much outward into Letter and Form: And tho' the Lord in many Things helped us, yet therein he was againſt us, and brought Darkneſs, Confuſion and Scattering upon us. I was ſorely broken and darkned, and in this darkned State, ſometimes lay ſtill for a long Seaſon, ſecretly mourning and crying out to the Lord Night and Day; ſometimes I ran a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, bearkning after what might apped<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>At laſt, after all my Diſireſſes, Wandarings and ſore Travels, I met with ſome Writings of this People called Quakers, which I caſt a ſlight Eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and diſdained, as falling very ſhort of that Wiſdom, Light, Life and Power, which I had been longing for and ſearching after: I had like wiſe (ſome pretty Diſtance of Time after this) Opportunity of meeting with ſame of them, and divers of them were by the Lord moved (I know it to be ſo ſince) to come to me: As I remember, at the very firſt they reached to the Life of God in me, which Life anſwered their voice, and cauſed a great Love in me to ſpring to them: But ſtill in my Reaſonings with them, and Diſputes alone (in my Mind) concerning them, I was very far off from owning them, as ſo knowing the Lord, or ſo appearing in his Life and Power as my Condition needed, and as my Soul waited for. Yea, the more I converſed with them, the more I ſeemed in my Underſtanding and Reaſon to get over them, and to trample them under my Feet, as a poor, weak, ſilly, contemptible Generation, who had ſome Smatterings of Truth in them, and ſome honeſt Deſires towards God, but very far off from the clear and full Underſtanding of his Way and Will. And this was the Effict almoſt of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vrey Diſcourſe with them, they ſtill reached my Heart, and I felt then in
<pb n="650" facs="unknown:003104_0661_0FEFF9BC34737998"/>
the Secrets of my Soul, which cauſed the Love in me always to continue, yea ſometimes to encreaſe towards them: But daily my Underſtanding got more and more over them, and therein I daily more and more deſpiſed them.</p>
                        <p>After a long Time I was invited to hear one of them (as I had been often, they in tender Love pitying me, and feeling my Want of that, which they poſſeſſed) and there was an Anſwer in my Heart, and I went in Fear and Trembling, with Deſires to the moſt High, who was over all and knew all, that I might not receive any Thing for Truth, which was not of him, nor withſtand any Thing which was of him, but might how before the Appearance of the Lord my God, and none other. And indeed, when I came, I felt the Preſence and Power of the moſt High among them, and Words of Truth, from the Spirit of Truth, reaching to my Heart and Conſcience, opening my State as in the Preſence of the Lord. Yea, I did not only feel Words and Demonſtrations from without, but I felt the Dead quickned, the Seed raiſed, inſomuch as my Heart (in the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Light, and Clearneſs of true Senſe)ſaid, <hi>This is he, this is he, there is no other; this is He whom I have waited for and fought after from my Childhood, who was always near me, and had often begotten Life in my Heart, but I knew him not diſtinctly, nor how to receive him or dwell with him.</hi> And then in this Senſe (in the Melting and Breakings of my Spirit) was I given up to the Lord to become his, both in waiting for the farther Revealings of his Seed in me, and to ſerve him in the Life and Power of his Seed.</p>
                        <p>Now what I met with after this, in my Travels, in my Waitings, in my ſpiritnal Exerciſes, is not to be uttered; only in general I may ſay this, I met with the very Strength of Hell. The cruel Oppreſſor roared upon me, and made me feel the bitterneſs of his Captivity, while he had any Power: Yea, the Lord was far from my Help, and from the Voice of my roaring. I alſo met with deep Subtilties and Devices to entangle me in that Wiſdom, which ſeemeth able to make wiſe in the Things of God, but indeed is Fooliſhneſs and a Snare to the Soul, bringing it back into Captivity, where the Emmy's Gins prevail And what I met with outwardly from my own dear Father, from my Kindred, from my Servants, from the People and Powers of the World, for tio other Cauſe but fearing my God, worſhipping him as he hath required of me, and bowing to his Seed (which is his Son) who is to be worſhipped by Men and Angels for evermore; the Lord my God knoweth, before whom my Heart and Ways are, who preſerved me in Love to them, in the midſt of all I ſuffered from them, and doth ſtill ſo preſerve me, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be his pure and holy Name.</p>
                        <p>But ſome may deſire to know, what I have at laſt met with: I anſwer, <hi>I have met with the Seed.</hi> Underſtand that Word, and thou wilt be ſatisfied, and enquire no farther. I have met with my God, I have met with my Saviour; and he hath not been preſent with me without his Salvation, but I have felt the Healings drop upon my Soul from under his Wings; I have met with the true Knowledge, the Knowledge of Life, the living Knowledge, the Knowledge which is Life, and this hath had the true Vertue in it, which my Soul hath rejoiced in, in the Preſence of the Lord. I have met with the Seed's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in the Seed I have felt him my Father: There I have read his Nature, his Love, his Compaſſions, his Tenderneſs, which have melted, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and changed my Heart before him. I have met with the Seed's Faith, which hath done and doth that, which the Faith of Man can never do. I have met with the true Birth, with the Birth which is Heir of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and inherits the Kingdom. I have met with the true Spirit of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Supplication, wherein the Lord is prevailed with, and which draws from him whatever the Condition needs, the Soul always looking up to him in the Will, and in the Time and Way which is acceptable with him. What ſhall I ſay? I have met with the true Peace, the true Righteouſneſs, the
<pb n="651" facs="unknown:003104_0662_0FEFF979B0520E60"/>
true Holineſs, the true Reſt of the Soul, the everlaſting Habitation, which the Redeemed dwell in: And I know all theſe to be true, in him that is true, and am capable of no Doubt, Diſpute or Reaſoning in my Mind about them, it abiding there, where it hath received the full Aſſurance and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. And alſo I know very well and diſtinctly in Spirit, where the Doubts and Diſputes are, and where the Certainty and full Aſſurance is, and in the tender Mercy of the Lord am preſerved out of the one, and in the other.</p>
                        <p>Now (the Lord knows) theſe Things I do not utter in a boaſting Way, but would rather be ſpeaking of my Nothingneſs, my Emptineſs, my Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, my manifold Infirmities which I feel more than ever. The Lord hath broken the Man's Part in me, and I am a Worm and no Man before him: I have no Strengh to do any Good or Service for him, nay I cannot watch over or preſerve my ſelf: I feel daily that I keep not alive my own Soul, but am weaker before Men, yea weaker in my Spirit (as in my ſelf) than ever I have been. But I cannot but utter to the Praiſe of my God, that I feel his Arm ſtretched out for me; and my Weakneſs (which I feel in my ſelf) is not my Loſs, but Advantage before him. And theſe Things I write, as having no End at all therein of my own, but felt it this Morning required of me, and ſo in Submiſſion and Subjection to my God, have I given up to do it, leaving the Succeſs and Service of it with him.</p>

            <p>From this Concluſion we ſee the Humility of the Mind of this Friend,<note place="margin">A Caution to conceived Wits.</note> who, when he writ this, was already much advanced in the Way of Godlineſs, and had lived ſeveral Years in the Communion of thoſe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Quakers.</hi> Now, tho' it be the Duty of every one, not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited of himſelf, yet certain it is, that Men of refined Wits above all others have need to continue truly humble, and not to rely thereon, ſince the truſting to Acuteneſs of Wit hath rather drawn off many from the Way of Truth, than led them to it; nay, it hath occaſioned the Fall of ſome. But that <hi>I. Pennington</hi> endeavoured to continue in true Humility, appears plainly from the Relation above. He was a Man of a very compaſſionate Temper, and yet valiant in Adverſities: He alſo ſuffered not a little on the Account of his Religion, but endured many tedious and long Impriſonments, which were the more hard to him, becauſe he being of a weakly Conſtitution, the Suffering of Cold and Hardſhip, did him the more Hurt. And yet he never fainted, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſtedfaſt to the End of his Life, which was in the latter Part of the Year 1679, when he departed in a pious Frame of Mind.</p>
            <p>By the foregoing Relation it appears evidently that he was very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly ſeeking after the true Way to Salvation, before he attained to a perfect Quietneſs of Mind; yet in that Time there wanted not ſuch as were helpful to him with good and wholeſome Advice; and among theſe <hi>John Crook</hi> (whoſe Occurrences make up no ſmall Part of this Hiſtory) was none of the leaſt.

I can tell, for I was as one that once went aſtray, and wandered upon the barren Mountains; and when I had wearied my ſelf with Wandering, I went into the Wilderneſs, and there I was torn as with Briars, and pricked as with Thorns, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thinking this was the Way, and ſometimes concluding that was the Way, and by and by concluding all was out of the Way, and then bitter Mourning came upon me, and Weeping for Want of the Interpreter; for when I ſought to know what was the Matter, and where I was, it was too hard for me; then I thought I would ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on ſome Way where it was moſt likely to find a loſt God, and I would pray with them that prayed, and faſt with them that faſted, and mourn with them that mourned, if by any Means I might come to Reſt, but found it not, until I came to ſee the Candle lighted in my own Houſe, and my Heart ſwept from thoſe Thoughts and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, and Willings, and Runnings, and to die unto them all, not heeding of them, but watching againſt them, leſt I ſhould let my Mind go a whoring after them; and here I dwelt for a Time as in a deſolate Land uninhabited, where I ſat alone as a Sparrow upon the Houſe-top, and was hunted up and down like a Partridge upon the Mountains, and could reſt no where, but ſome Luſt or Thought or other followed me at the Heels, and diſquieted me Night and Day, until I came to know him in whom was Reſt, and no Occaſion of Stumbling, in whom the Devil hath no Part, and he became unto me as an Hiding-place from the Storms, and from the Tempeſts. Then came my Eyes to ſee my Saviour, and my Sorrow to fly away, and he became made unto me all in all, my Wiſdom, my Righteouſneſs, and my Sanctification, in whom I was and am compleat, to the Praiſe of the Riches of his Grace and Goodneſs that endures forever. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be not diſcouraged, O thou toſſed as with Tempeſts, nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed in thy ſelf, becauſe thou ſeeſt ſuch mighty Hoſts of Enemies riſing up againſt thee and beſetting thee on every Side; for none was ſo beſet, and tried and tempted as the true Seed was, who was a Man of Sorrows, and acquainted with Grief: But be thou ſtill in thy Mind, and let the Billows paſs over, and Wave upon Wave, and fret not thy ſelf becauſe of them, neither be caſt down, as if it ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be otherwiſe with thee; Sorrow comes at Night, but Joy in the Morning, and the Days of thy Mourning ſhall be over, and the Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer will God caſt out for ever; for therefore was I afflicted, and not comforted, and tempted and tried for this End, that I might know how to ſpeak a Word in due Seaſon unto thoſe who are tempted and afflicted as I once was; as it was ſaid unto me in that Day when Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="653" facs="unknown:003104_0664_0FEFF97CD0BD3F70"/>
lay heavy upon me: Therefore be not diſconſolated, neither give Heed unto the Reaſonings and Diſputings of thy own Heart, nor the Fears that riſe therefrom, but be ſtrong in the Faith, believing in the Light which lets thee ſee them, and his Grace thou wilt know to be ſufficient for thee, and his Strength to be made perfect in thy Weakneſs, and ſo wilt thou rather glory in thy Infirmities, that his Power may reſt upon thee, than in thy earneſt Deſires to be rid of them; for by theſe Things thou wilt come to live in the Life of God, and joy in God, and glory in Tribulation, when thou haſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all Conditions to be contented, and thro' Trials and deep Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes is the Way to learn this Leſſon. Theſe Things in dear Love to thee I have written, being ſomewhat ſenſible of thy Condition, and the many Snares thou are daily liable unto, therefore watch that thou fall not into Temptation, and my God and Father keep thee in the Arms of eternal Love, over all, unto the End, unto his Praiſe. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>Some have been reached by the Sayings of dying Penitents;<note place="margin">Some convinced by dying Peni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tents.</note> for there have been remarkable Inſtances of young People, ſprung from honeſt Parents, who having walked in the broad Way, did very earneſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail their Out-goings on a dying Bed, and then declared, that if it pleaſed God to raiſe them up again, they would not, as before, be aſhamed of the deſpiſed Way of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> nor fear any Mockings, or Perſecution, but that they would ſerve the Lord in Uprightneſs, and with all their Heart.

               </note> I'll only mention one, <hi>viz.</hi> that of a young Maid at <hi>London,</hi> called <hi>Suſanna Whitrow,</hi> whoſe Mother was of the Society of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> but not her Father.

Now the Day is come. Pride and Diſobedience were my curſed Fruits, which I brought forth when I was a Hearer in the publick Church.

Then coming Home on the Sabbath-Day, I went immediately up into my Chamber, and locking the Door, I altered all my Lates, and ſo I went to their Worſhip in the Afternoon, dreſſed in their Mode, and then I pleaſed them.</hi> At another Time ſhe ſaid, <hi>O that I might have a little Time longer to go into the Country, and walk in the Woods to ſeek the Lord! O what Matter for fine Houſes, and ſilk Apparel! O remember him that ſat on the Ground, and wore a Garment without a Seam, our bleſſed holy Lord, who went up to the Mountains to pray, and withdrew himſelf into Gardens, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate Places.

me: Therefore I deſire to live, that I might live an holy and righteous Life, that my Converſation might be in Heaven, tho' my Body be here on Earth. How would I then invite and warn others, not to ſpend their precious Time in adorning themſelves like</hi> Jezebel, <hi>patching and painting, and curling their Hair. O the Chriſtian Life is quite another Thing: We muſt not give our ſelves the Liberty to think our own Thoughts, much leſs to act ſuch Abominations.</hi> Several Days ſhe was in a ſtrong Wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and Conflict of Spirit, and in fervent Prayer to God, ſo that when ſomebody was for removing her Head a little, ſhe refuſing it, ſaid, <hi>I would not ſuffer a Thought to wander; if I move, I ſhall be drawn off my Watch, and then the Tempter will prevail.</hi> Continuing in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, ſhe conceived at length Hopes of Forgiveneſs; and being thus ſtrengthned by Mercy, ſhe ſaid to the Lord, <hi>O what can my Soul ſay of thy Power! When I ſought thee but could not find thee; I knocked hard but none did open; for my Sins ſtood like Mountains, that I could not come near thee: I would fain have prayed to thee but could not. Thus I lay ſeveral Days and Nights, ſtruggling for Life, but could find none; and I ſaid, There is no Mercy for me: Then I ſaid, I will never leave thee; if I periſh, I will periſh here; I will never ceaſe crying unto thee. And then I heard a Voice ſay,</hi> Jacob wreſtled all Night before he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Bleſſing. <hi>Oh then thy Word, O Lord, was ſtrong to my Soul: Then my ſtony Heart was broken to Pieces, and the Spirit of Prayer and Supplication was poured upon me. And now I can ſing as</hi> David <hi>did, of Mercy and of Judgment: Unto thee, O Lord, will I ſing with a rent Heart, and with my Mouth in the Duſt will I ſing Praiſes to thee, my bleſſed Saviour.</hi> In this Frame ſhe endeavoured to continue, and once ſhe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for her Father, called <hi>Robert Whitrow,</hi> Part of which Prayer was as followeth. <hi>O Lord, remember not his Offences, let me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His Temptations are great, Lord carry him thro'; O let him not periſh with the World; do thou' ſupport him over this World. Shall a little Dirt of this World draw away his Mind? O Lord, let his Mind be ſet on Things above; fix his Mind upon thee.</hi> Thus fervently this young Maid prayed for her Father, herſelf now having attained to a full Aſſurance of her Salvation, ſo that ſhe once ſaid to the Lord: <hi>O thou Beloved of my Soul, what ſhall I ſay of thee! For thou art too won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful for me: O Praiſes be unto thee.</hi> And afterward perceiving that her End was approaching, ſhe ſaid to her Mother, <hi>I muſt lay down this Body; the Lord will not truſt me longer in this preſent wicked World: Happy am I: My Saviour, my Soul loves thee dearly; thy Love is better than Wine: My Saviour, my Holy One, how glorious art thou! I have ſeen thy Glory; I am overcome with thy ſweet Countenance: O how lovely art thou! My Heart is raviſhed with the ſweet Smiles of thy glorious Countenance. O, come away, come away! Why doſt thou ſtay? I am ready, I am ready.</hi> Then ſhe lay ſome Time very ſtill, and ſo departed this Life without Sigh or Groan, which was about the Year 1677.</p>
            <p>Such like dying Perſons have been the Means ſometimes to ſtir up others to true Godlineſs,<note place="margin">Some convinced by beholding the weighty Frame of Friends in their ſilent Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies.</note> whereby they came to be joined with the People called <hi>Quakers;</hi> and tho' theſe in Time came to be very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, yet at firſt there were but few Labourers in the Miniſtry of the Word. But theſe recommending one another to give diligent Heed to the Word of God in the Heart, and to mind That as their Teacher, did often meet together, and keep Aſſemblies, ſitting down with ſuch a deep Retiredneſs of Mind, being turned inward to God, that Tears trickled down their Cheeks, to the Aſtoniſhment of many that looked upon them, ſome of which, only by beholding this ſerious Retiredneſs, came to be ſo effectually reach'd, that they alſo joined with them, and

frequented their Meetings. In the mean while many of theſe became more and more confirmed in their Minds by this ſilent Exerciſe, and their Underſtandings came to be ſo opened, that in Proceſs of Time they became apt and fit Inſtruments to exhort others to Godlineſs: And among theſe, ſeveral Women alſo found it their Duty to preach the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>There have been many who were very averſe to the <hi>Quakers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>C. Bacon</hi> going to a Meeting in a vain Mind, is ſo reach'd, that in Time he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a zealous Preacher and Sufferer among Friends.</note> and yet came to join with them in the Faith; as among others <hi>Chriſtopher Bacon</hi> in <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> who (about the Year 1656, coming into a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not with Intention to be edified there, but rather to ſcoff, and to fetch his Wife from thence, who went thither againſt his Mind) was ſo reached by the lively Exhortation he heard, that he was not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the Truth preached there, but in Time became a zealous Preacher of it himſelf, and was valiant in Sufferings. Once being taken up at a Meeting at <hi>Glaſſenbury,</hi> and brought before Biſhop <hi>Mew</hi> at <hi>Wells,</hi> who called him a <hi>Rebel,</hi> for meeting contrary to the King's Laws, <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> having formerly been a Soldier for the King, ſaid to him, <hi>Doſt thou call me Rebel? I would have thee to know, that I have ventured my Life for the King in the Field, when ſuch as thou lay behind Hedges.</hi> By this he ſtop'd the Biſhop's Mouth, who did not expect ſuch an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and therefore was willing to be rid of him.</p>
            <p>The like Inſtance of an unexpected Converſion was ſeen alſo in <hi>William Gibſon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>W. Gibſon</hi> convinced going to diſtrub <hi>T.

            <p>To theſe Inſtances I may add that of a certain Trumpeter,<note place="margin">And a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter much in the like Manner.</note> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a <hi>Quakers</hi> Meeting, began in an inſolent Manner to ſound his Trumpet, thereby to drown the Voice of him that preached: But this had a contrary Effect, and ſtirred up the Zeal of the Preacher the more, ſo that he went on as if none diſturbed him. The Trumpeter at length to recover his Breath, was fain to ceaſe blowing; but being ſtill govern'd by an evil Spirit, after ſome Intermiſſion began to ſound again: But whatever he did, he was not able to divert the Preacher from his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, tho' he hindred the Auditory from hearing what was ſpoken. Thus he wearied himſelf ſo much, that he was forced to reſt again for Reſpiration; whereby, in Spight of his evil Will, he came to hear what the Preacher ſpoke, which was ſo piercing, that the Trumpeter came to be deeply affected with it, and burſting out into Tears, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd his Crime, and came to be a true Penitent; a remarkable Evidence of the Truth of that Saying of the Apoſtle;<note place="margin">Rom. ix. 16.</note> 
               <hi>So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth Mercy.</hi>

received ſuch pertinent Anſwers from <hi>J. Naylor,</hi> that in a great Degree he was convinced of the Truth held by <hi>J. N.</hi> and his Friends.</p>
            <p>By what hath been related here,<note place="margin">The concluſion of this Book manifeſts the Increaſe of this People, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Severity and Cruelty of their Adverſaries, and at length their being to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated by Law.</note> may be ſeen how unexpectedly ſome entred into Society with the <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſo called; more Inſtances of which might be produced if needful, ſince I have known ſuch, who being natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of a boiſterous Temper, yet were ſo ſtruck with the Terror of the Lord, that they came to be of ſuch a quiet Spirit, and harmleſs Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, that as formerly they could not ſuffer the leaſt Provocation, ſo now they bore all Revilings and Mockings with an even and undiſturbed Mind, becauſe the Fear of God had made ſuch deep Impreſſions upon them, that they were careful, leſt by an angry or impetuous Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they ſhould ſin againſt him. And thus continuing to live in Fear, and a reverential Awe, they improved in true Godlineſs; inſomuch, that by their pious Lives, they preached as well as others with Words. After this Manner the Number of their Society encreaſed; but then grievous Sufferings enſued; for the Prieſts could not endure to ſee that their Hearers left them; the furious Mob were ſpurred on, and among the Magiſtrates there were many, who being of a fierce Temper, uſed all their Strength to root out the Profeſſors of the Light, (as they were called at firſt) and to ſuppreſs and ſtifle their Doctrine: But all proved in vain, as appears abundantly from this Hiſtory, altho' there were hardly Priſons in <hi>England,</hi> where ſome of theſe People were not ſhut up, beſides the Spoil of Goods, and cruel Whippings that befel ſome of them. Yet all this they bore with a more than ordinary Courage, without making Reſiſtance, how great ſoever their Number was, and notwithſtanding many of them had been valiant Soldiers, who often had ſlain their Enemies in the Field, without regarding Danger.</p>
            <p>In the Conſideration of this undaunted Stedfaſtneſs, it hath ſeemed to me, that there have been ſome ſuch among this People, whoſe Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent was, valiantly to endure Perſecution for a good Cauſe, and who perhaps in Eaſe would not have been ſuch good Chriſtians, as they proved to be under theſe Sufferings; reſembling the <hi>Cammomil</hi> in this, which the more it is depreſſed, or rubbed, the better it grows, and yields the ſtronger Scent. Being then thus oppreſſed, they found themſelves under a Neceſſity of continuing vigilant and watchful, and according to King <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Advice, to <hi>keep their Heart with all Diligence.</hi> This made them love what they judged to be Truth more than their Lives, and it cauſed them to be careful, leſt that ſhould come over them which the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> was threatened with, becauſe ſhe had left her firſt Love, <hi>viz.</hi> the Removing of her Candleſtick out of its Place. Thus their mutual Love increaſed, and their own Lives they valued not, when the grieving of their Conſciences ſtood in Competition with it. Having thus paſs'd thro' many Adverſities, with an unwearied and laſting Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and being become a great People, known by the Name of <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> they were at length, by the generous Clemency of King <hi>William</hi> III. and the Favour of the Parliament, declared to be a Society, who ſhould henceforth be tolerated in the Kingdom as <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters,</hi> with Liberty to perform their Religious Worſhip in publick without Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance.</p>

            <p>In the Year 1652, <hi>G.

               </gap>eſs him with Prejudice. Not long after <hi>G. Fox</hi> got Opportunity to ſpeak to him, which gave him ſuch Satisfaction, that he owned that which was ſpoken to be Truth; and his Wife ordered a Dinner to be made ready for her Friend <hi>G. Fox,</hi> and thoſe that were with him. And ſome Time after he told his Wife, when he heard that ſhe and her Friends were conſulting where to have a Meeting, that they might meet in his Hall; which they did; and tho' he himſelf did not come there, yet when a Meeting was kept, he uſed to ſit in a Chair ſo near to it, that tho' he could not be ſeen of every Body, yet he could hear what was preached; which he liked <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o well, that it is not known, that after he had heard <hi>G. Fox,</hi> he ever frequented the publick Church: Inſomuch, that tho' he entred not into full Society with the <hi>Quakers,</hi> yet he favoured them, and ſeveral Times ſtop'd the Malice of their Perſecutors, when it was in his Power ſo to do.</p>
            <p>After he had been married ſix and twenty Years, to <hi>Margaret,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Death of Judge Fell</note> and had nine Children by her, he deceaſed in the Year 1658, leaving behind him a Son and ſeven Daughters.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Margaret</hi> being thus become a Widow, neglected no Opportunity to ſerve her Friends. In the Year 1660, when King <hi>Charles</hi> II. was reſtor'd, (ſcarce two Weeks after he came in) ſhe went to <hi>London,</hi> and ſpoke ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Times with that Prince, that he would cauſe the Sufferings of her Friends to ceaſe; and in Order thereto ſhe writ, not only to him, but alſo to the Dukes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> the Queen Mother, the Princeſs of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the Queen of <hi>Bohemia.</hi> And after having been about fifteen Months at <hi>London,</hi> ſhe at length prevailed with the King, that her Friends who were in Priſon were releaſed by Proclamation. But Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution afterwards beginning again, ſhe went to ſpeak with the King and the D
ke of <hi>York</hi> at <hi>Hampton-Court.</hi> In the Year 1664 for refuſing to ſwear, ſhe was confined in <hi>Lancaſter-Caſtle,</hi> and kept long in Durance; for (becauſe of her great Service in the Church) ſhe was much envied as well as <hi>G. Fox,</hi> to whom ſhe was married about eleven Years after the Deceaſe of her firſt Husband Judge <hi>Fell.</hi> But not long after ſhe was again impriſoned, and continued a Year in Jail, being moſt Part of that Time ſickly; and afterwards was ſeveral Times fined for Preaching. In the ſeventieth Year of her Age ſhe ſpoke again with the King, which was the laſt Time; but ſhe was not received ſo favourably as formerly, for he ſeemed to be ſomewhat angry; and therefore ſhe writ to him, and ſtaid at <hi>London</hi> in Hopes of an Anſwer; but he was ſuddenly taken away by Death. Afterwards ſhe ſpoke with King <hi>James,</hi> and writ to him alſo. And at length, after a laborious and godly Life, ſhe piouſly departed from hence in a great Age, as hath been ſaid already, having uttered in the Time of her Sickneſs many excellent Sayings, by which it appeared that ſhe was prepared for Death,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>She writ</hi> The Call of the Jews out of Babylon, <hi>dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to</hi> M. B Iſrael, <hi>and many other Pieces.</hi>
               </note> and longed to be diſſolved. She had been a zealous Preacher, and alſo written much, and among the reſt a Book entitled, <hi>The Call of the Jews out of Babylon,</hi> which ſhe dedicated to the famous <hi>Manaſſeh Ben Iſrael,</hi> and charged him, as he would anſwer it before God, to cauſe it to be read among his Brethren. This Book being tranſlated by <hi>William Ames</hi> into <hi>Dutch,</hi> was alſo printed in that Language, whilſt her firſt Husband lived.</p>

And now the Strength and Power of their violent Oppoſers was broken by the Favour of King <hi>William</hi> III. and his Succeſſor Queen <hi>Anne</hi> hath favourably confirmed the Liberty of Conſcience and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, granted by an Act of Parliament to the <hi>Quakers.</hi> So that now we may look upon them as a free People, and a Society tolerated by ſupreme Authority; and therefore I might now finiſh this Hiſtory, as to the Import of the Title.</p>
            <p>But before I conclude,<note place="margin">Something as to their Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. Concerning the Light.</note> I intend to ſay ſomething concerning their Doctrine, of which Mention hath been often made in this Work, <hi>viz.</hi> That their chief Principle, in which they differ from the Generality of modern Chriſtian Societies, is, that every Man is enlightned with the Divine Light, according to the Evangeliſt <hi>John,</hi> who in the firſt Chapter, ſpeaking of Chriſt as he was from Eternity with the Father, calls him <hi>the Word,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John i. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> and ſaith, That <hi>The Word was God, that all Things were made by him, that in him was Life, and the Life was the Light of Men.</hi> And the Evangeliſt ſpeaking concerning <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, who was ſent from God, ſaith, <hi>He was not that Light, but was ſent to bear Witneſs of that Light: That was the true Light, which lighteth every Man that cometh into the World.</hi> By this it appears, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> have not coin'd a new Phraſe, but only made uſe of the expreſs Words of the holy Scripture. I am not unacquainted that, during the great Apoſtacy, Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple generally have not clearly underſtood this; yet it ought not to ſeem ſtrange, becauſe the Evangeliſt ſaith, <hi>The Light ſhineth in Darkneſs, and the Darkneſs comprehended it not.</hi> But to elucidate this Doctrine a little more, it may ſerve for Information, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> believe this Light to be the ſame that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>The Grace of God that bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Salvation, and hath appeared to all Men:</hi> And concerning its Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he ſaith, <hi>teaching us, that denying Ungodlineſs, and worldly Luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus much briefly concerning the above-mentioned Denominations of this Divine Light; and to make it appear more plainly what this Phraſe means, <hi>Take heed to the Light;</hi> thereby we underſtand, that each one minding the Counſel of the Light in their Souls, may learn to fear God, and hate Pride, Arrogancy, and every evil Way, which will beget in us ſuch a reverential Awe towards God, that we dare not do any Thing which we certainly know will diſpleaſe him; and this is the firſt Step to Godlineſs: And therefore both <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> have ſaid, that <hi>the Fear of God is the Beginning of Wiſdom,</hi> viz. that Fear which is filial and accompanied with Circumſpection and Cautiouſneſs; and as we perſevere in this Fear, <hi>we are enabled to ſerve the Lord in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs all the Days of our Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſince we can do this only by the Grace of God,<note place="margin">Prayer.</note> 'tis abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that we take heed thereto: And therefore we ought to pray to God continually for his Aſſiſtance. But here ſtarts up ſomething, of
<pb n="661" facs="unknown:003104_0672_0FEFF987E16FA1A0"/>
which People generally have a wrong Notion: For all Sorts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians agree, that we muſt often pray to God, but in the manner of it many err greatly. For ſome think they perform this Duty of praying to God, when in the Mornings and Evenings, and at other certain Times of the Day, they repeat or recite ſome Forms of Prayer, and don't ſeem to conſider,<note place="margin">Luke xviii. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>That Men ought always to pray, and not to faint.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts to <hi>pray without ceaſing.</hi> And what this means, he himſelf explains in theſe Words, <hi>Praying always with all Prayer and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication in the Spirit,</hi> which plainly ſhews, that it conſiſts not in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual repeating of Prayers, but in pious and devout Breathings to God, raiſed in the Soul by the Spirit of Chriſt, that it may pleaſe him to keep us continually in his Fear and Counſel, ſince we are in want of daily Support from him. And thus praying in Faith, we receive an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to our Breathings in ſome Meaſure, tho' not always ſo ſoon as we deſire: But we muſt not faint; and our Prayer muſt be from a ſincere believing and breathing of the Heart; otherwiſe we pray amiſs, and do not receive,<note place="margin">James iv. 3.</note> according to the Saying of the Apoſtle <hi>James, Ye ask, and receive not, becauſe ye ask amiſs.</hi> But what Devices and Wiles have not been invented by the Enemy of Man's Soul, to keep him off from this continual State of Prayer!<note place="margin">Mat. xxvi. 41.</note> Altho' Chriſt very expreſly ſaith, <hi>Watch and pray,<note place="margin">Mark xiii. 37</note> that ye enter not into Temptation.</hi> And, <hi>What I ſay unto you, I ſay unto all, Watch.</hi> Which in regard to the Inſtruction we may reap thence, doth not imply a continual Watching without ſleeping, but a Vigilancy of the Mind, which <hi>Solomon</hi> recommends in theſe Words, <hi>Keep thy Heart with all Diligence.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. iv. 23</note> Now tho' our Conſtitution doth not ſeem to admit an inceſſant Continuance in the deepeſt Retiredneſs of Mind, yet this is certain, that the more fervently we turn our Minds to God, the more we are kept from Evil. And Man perſevering in this godly Excrciſe, is the leſs in Danger of falling into ſpiritual Pride; ſince he finds that his Preſervation is in true Humility, and in a continual Dependance upon God: For if he once departs from thence, and thinks himſelf ſafe enough, and that now he needs not to walk circumſpectly in Fear as he once did, then he is caught already, and ſomewhat gone aſtray from his Spiritual Guide, to wit, from that which ſhewed unto him his Tranſgreſſions, and troubled him whilſt he was in the evil Way.

Then will I ſprinkle clean Water upon you; and ye ſhall be clean from all your Filthineſs,</hi> &amp;c. It is a common Objection, that Chriſt himſelf was baptized with Water, and that we are required to follow his Footſteps: But let it be conſidered that he was circumciſed alſo, tho' the one as well as the other needed not to his Melioration, but was done for our ſake, to ſhew us by the latter, that our Hearts muſt be circumciſed, that is, ſeparated from all evil Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and Luſts. And by the Baptiſm which he ſuffered to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred to him, is ſignified to us, that we muſt be baptized by his Spiritual Baptiſm. And if it be objected, that Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Nicodemus, Except a Man be born of Water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> It may be anſwered, that if this muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtood of outward Water, the Conſequence will be, that Water-Baptiſm is of ſuch an abſolute Neceſſity, that if any be deprived of it, he is to be ſhut out of Heaven, which, tho' believed by Papiſts, yet I think Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants will hardly ſay ſo; neither was <hi>John Calvin</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. Calvin. Epiſt. 184. &amp; 229.</note> of that Opinion. It is alſo worth taking notice, that <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt ſaid, that Chriſt ſhould baptize <hi>with Fire;</hi> by which it appears, that both <hi>Water</hi> and <hi>Fire</hi> in this Senſe are metaphorical Expreſſions: For they both ſerve for cleanſing and purifying, tho' in a different Way. Now altho' ſome did baptize with Water, yet it ought to be conſidered, that if the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt to his Diſciples, <hi>Go ye and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> related abſolutely to Water-Baptiſm, it would indeed have been very ſtrange, that <hi>Paul</hi> that eminent Apoſtle of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> did not think himſelf commiſſionated for the Adminiſtration of that Baptiſm. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, if the Apoſtles had really received a Commiſſion from the Lord to that Purpoſe, he by no Means would have been ſingled out; ſince ſpeaking of himſelf he ſaith,<note place="margin">2 Cor. xi. 5.</note> that <hi>he ſuppoſed he was not a whit behind the very chiefeſt Apoſtles;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. i. 17. v. 14.</note> and yet he alſo ſaith in expreſs Terms, <hi>Chriſt ſent me not to baptize, but to preach the Goſpel.</hi> And, <hi>I thank God that I baptized none of you but</hi> Criſpus <hi>and</hi> Gaius. <hi>And I baptized alſo the Houſhold of</hi> Stephanas: <hi>Beſides, I know not whether I baptized any other.</hi> And yet he ſaith, <hi>There is one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm,</hi> which was the Baptiſm of the Spirit.<note place="margin">1 Cor. i. 16.</note> And the ſame Apoſtle ſaith alſo, <hi>As many as have been baptized into Chriſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. iv. 5.</note> 
               <hi>have put on Chriſt:</hi> And this cannot have Relation to Water-Baptiſm,<note place="margin">Gal. iii. 27.</note> becauſe many receive that, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver put on Chriſt, and become conformable to his Image, which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is required of all Chriſtians. To his may be added, that if the Command to baptize, <hi>Mat.</hi> xxviii. 19. were literally reſtricted to Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Baptiſm, then why may not our Saviour's Words be as well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood literally concerning the waſhing his Diſciples Feet, when he ſaid to <hi>Peters,<note place="margin">John xiii. 8, 14.</note> If I waſh thee not, thou haſt no Part with me;</hi> and to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>If I then your Lord and Maſter have waſhed your Feet, ye alſo oug

Supper in Remembrance of Chriſt's Sufferings, alſo a Figure, <hi>viz.</hi> of his Spiritual Supper with the Soul; and doth it not ſeem abſurd, that one Figure ſhould be the Antitype of the other. The Paſſover was not a Memorial of another Sign that was to follow; but it was a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of the ſlaying of all the Firſt-born in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and of the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and their Firſt-born. Moreover it may be ſaid, that the Paſchal Lamb was eaten in their Families, whereas the outward Supper now is celebrated in publick Places for Worſhip.

And certainly they do well who daily at Meals remember Chriſt and his Sufferings: For the Spiritual Supper, which is the Thing required, ought to be partaken of by every true Chriſtian; and this can't be, unleſs we being attentive, open the Door of our Hearts to Chriſt and let him come in.

               <note place="margin">Way of Wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhip.</note> It is uſual among them, when they meet together in their Religious Aſſemblies, to ſpend ſome Time in a devout Silence and Retiredneſs of Mind, inwardly praying with pure Breathings to God, which they generally call <hi>Waiting upon the Lord:</hi> And if, under this Spiritual Exerciſe, any one feels himſelf ſtirred up of God, to ſpeak ſomething by Way of Doctrine or Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, he doth ſo, and ſometimes more than one, but orderly, one after another. And that this was uſual in the Primitive Apoſtolical Church, appears from what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">1 Cor. xiv 3</note> 
               <hi>If any Thing be revealed to another that ſitteth by, let the firſt hold his Peace: For ye may all propheſy one by one.</hi> And what <hi>Propheſying</hi> ſignifieth under the New Covenant, the Apoſtle himſelf explains with theſe Words,<note place="margin">1 Cor xiv 4</note> 
               <hi>He that propheſyeth, edifieth the Church.</hi> Yet let none think this Liberty of Speaking to be ſo unlimited, that every Body that can ſay ſomething, may freely do ſo in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation: For he that will ſpeak there, muſt alſo by all Means be of a good, and honeſt, and holy Life, and found in Doctrine; and if in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Time he finds in himſelf a Concern from the Lord to travel in the Miniſtry, and deſires a Certificate of his Soundneſs in Doctrine and

orderly Life, he may have it from the Congregation where he reſides. And certainly a Preacher himſelf ought to have Experience of the Work of Sanctification, before he is qualified to inſtruct others in the Way thereto: For meer Brain-Knowledge can't do that effectually. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in their Meetings there is a publick Prayer before Preaching; and Preaching is generally concluded with a Prayer.</p>
            <p>Now Preaching among them is not confined to the Male Sex,<note place="margin">Womens Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching.</note> as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others: For they believe that Women whom the Lord hath gift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Goſpel-Miniſtry, may exerciſe their Gifts among them to Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: For who will preſume to ſay to him, <hi>What doſt thou?</hi> To him namely,<note place="margin">1 Theſ. v. 19 1 Cor. xiv. 34.</note> who by his Apoſtle hath ſaid, <hi>Quench not the Spirit.</hi> They are not ignorant that the ſame Apoſtle ſaid to the <hi>Corinthians, Let your Women keep Silence in the Churches.</hi> Now not to inſiſt on the Word <hi>your,</hi> which ſeems to carry an Emphaſis along with it, as being chiefly applicable to thoſe <hi>Corinthian</hi> Women, yet by what follows, it appears plainly, that it regards ignorant Women, ſince it is ſaid there, <hi>If they will learn any thing,</hi> that is, if they will be farther inſtructed concerning ſome Points of Doctrine, <hi>Let them ask their Husbands at Home.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appears that this Saying hath Relation to ſuch Women, who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from Indiſcretion or Curioſity, or out of a Deſire to be look'd upon as ſuch that knew alſo to ſay ſomething, propoſed Queſtions to the Church, and thereby cauſed more Confuſion than Edification: <hi>For it is</hi> indeed <hi>a Shame for</hi> ſuch <hi>Women to ſpeak in the Church;</hi> and the Apoſtle's Precept is,<note place="margin">ver. 40.</note>

About the Year 1650, ſhe was maried to <hi>John Audland,</hi> and in the Beginning of 1652 they both were by the Miniſtry of <hi>G. Fox</hi> convinced of that Truth he preached; and in the next Year they began to preach that Doctrine to others; for which in the following Year ſhe was committed to Priſon in the Town of <hi>Auk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in the County of <hi>Durham,</hi> where ſhe had Opportunity to ſpeak to th
People thro' the Window, which ſhe did ſo pathetically, that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral were affected with her Teſtimony; and after being releaſed, ſhe travelled up and down the Country, and had good Service; but not long after ſhe was again committed to Priſon on an Accuſation of having ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Blaſphemy, for which ſhe was tried at <hi>Banbury</hi> in <hi>Oxfordſhire;</hi> the Indictment drawn up againſt her containing that ſhe had ſaid, <hi>God did not live:</hi> Whereas that which ſhe ſaid was, <hi>that true Words might be a Lie in the Mouth of ſome that ſpoke them,</hi> alledging for Truth the Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> v. 2. <hi>Tho' they ſay the Lord liveth, ſure they ſwear falſly.</hi> The Judge before whom ſhe appeared, behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf moderately, and obſerving how wiſely ſhe anſwered to his Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with a modeſt Boldneſs, propoſed the Matter to the Jury thus; <hi>That ſhe acknowledged the Lord her God and Redeemer to live, and that there were Gods of the Heathen that were dead Gods.</hi> Some of the Juſtices upon the Bench, who ſought her Deſtruction, perceiving they ſhould not obtain their End, (for it had been divulged that ſhe ſhould be burnt) went off to influence the Jury, and byaſs them; which had this Effect, that they brought her in guilty of <hi>Miſdemeanour;</hi> which made one perfect ſay, <hi>It was illegal to indict her for one Fact, and to bring her in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And yet ſhe was very modeſt and humble, inſomuch that how full ſoever ſhe was of Matter, ſhe rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeared to preach in large Meetings, where ſhe knew there were Men qualified for that Service; and ſhe was grieved when ſhe perceived any of her Sex to be too forward on ſuch Occaſions; and therefore ſhe adviſed them to be cautious, tho' ſhe did not omit to encourage the Good in all, and endeavoured not to quench the Spirit in any. Thus ſhe continued in a vertuous Life to the End of her Days. At <hi>Briſtol</hi> ſhe once fell ſo ſick, that it was thought ſhe was nigh Death; and then ſhe exhorted thoſe that ſtood by, <hi>to prize their Time, and to prepare for their latter End, as God,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>hath inclined me to do, ſo that I enjoy unſpeakable Peace here, with full Aſſurance of eternal Reſt and Felicity in the World to come.</hi> But ſhe recovered from this Sickneſs; and when her dying Hour came, which was in her Dwelling-place near <hi>Kendal,</hi> ſhe was not leſs prepared, but ſaid, <hi>I bleſs the Lord I am prepared for my Change. I am full of Aſſurance of eternal Salvation, and a Crown of Glory, thro' my Dear Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Many other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Sayings ſhe utter'd during the Time of her Sickneſs; and when ſhe drew near her End, ſome of her Friends asking her, <hi>Whether ſhe knew them. Yes,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>I know you every one. I have my Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as clear as ever: For how ſhould it be otherwiſe, ſince my Peace is made with God thro' the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. I have no Diſturbance in Mind, therefore is my Underſtanding and Judgment ſo good and clear; but to lie under Affliction of Body and Mind, to feel pinching Pangs of Body even to Death, and to want Peace with God; O that would be intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable to bear!</hi> She adviſed her Husband to quit himſelf of the Cumber of the Things of this World, after her Death, that he might with the more Freedom attend the Miniſtry of the Goſpel; and ſaid ſhe, <hi>Warn all, but eſpecially the Rich, to keep Love, and not to be high-minded: For Humility and Holineſs is the Badge of our Profeſſion.</hi> A little before her Departure, ſome fainting Fits taking her, ſhe revived again, and ſaid, <hi>I was glad, thinking I was going to my eternal Reſt, without Diſturbance. I have both a Sight and Earneſt of eternal Reſt with God in the World to come.</hi> A little after ſhe ſaid, <hi>Methinks I grow weak and cold.

inclined to more Liberty, and to be eſteemed by the World; yet there have been others of the Epiſcopal Church, who not from any earthly Conſideration, but meerly by a Convincement of their Mind, have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd into Society with the <hi>Quakers,</hi> not ſcaring to make publick Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their Religion, as may appear by two Letters which I'll in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert here; the one of <hi>Samuel Criſp,</hi> a Clergyman of the Epiſcopal Church, who gave the following Account of his Change to one of his Relations.</p>

                  <p>I Received a Letter from thee the Week before laſt,<note place="margin">Letter of <hi>S. Criſp,</hi> a Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman, turn'd <hi>Quaker.</hi>
                     </note> which was ſent by thy Uncle <hi>Bolton:</hi> There were a great many kind Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in it, and in thy Siſter <hi>Clopton</hi>'s likewiſe. I acknowledge my ſelf much obliged to you both, and to the whole Family, for many repeated Kindneſſes, and if my School had not ingroſſed ſo much of my Time, I would have taken Opportunity to anſwer my dear Friend's Letter now, and upon that Account my Delay will be the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable.</p>
                  <p>The News thou haſt heard of my late Change is really true, I cannot conceal it, for it is what I glory in; neither was it any Proſpect of temporal Advantage that induced me to it, but a ſincere Love to the Truth, and pure Regard to my own Soul: Neither can I be ſufficiently thankful to God, that he hath let me live to this glorious Day, and not cut me off in the midſt of my Sins and Provocations againſt him; he is long-ſuffering to us ward, not willing that any ſhould pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, but that all ſhould come to Repentance: He hath brought me off from the Forms and Shadows of Religion, and let me ſee in a more illuſtrious Manner what is the Life and Subſtance of it, as he found me in ſome Degree faithful to that Meaſure of Light and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge he had beſtowed on me, whilſt I was in the Communion of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> therefore he was pleaſed of late, as I humbly waited upon him, to make known to me greater and deeper Myſteries of his Kingdom; and I can truly ſay, that I find by daily Experience, as I keep low and retired into that pure Gift which he hath planted within me, Things are every Day more and more cleared up to me. and the Truth ſhines and prevails greatly over the Kingdom of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and if I ſhould now turn my Back upon ſuch Manifeſtations as theſe, and entangle my ſelf again with the Yoke of Bondage, ſurely I ſhould grieve the holy Spirit, ſo that he might juſtly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his kind Operations, and never return more to aſſiſt and comfort me; for God is not mocked; Religion is a very ſerious and weighty Thing; Repentance and Salvation are not to be trifled with, nor is Turning to God to be put off till our own Time, Leiſure or Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency, but we muſt love and cheriſh the leaſt Appearance of Chriſt, not ſlighting or deſpiſing the Day of ſmall Things, but embrace the firſt Opportunity of following Chriſt in any of his Commands: When he ſpeaks there is ſuch Force and Authority in it, that we cannot ſtand to cavil, diſpute or ask Queſtions; for unleſs we will be ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate as to ſhut our Eyes againſt the Sun, we muſt needs confeſs to the Truth of his Doctrine, and preſently ſtrike in with it; and therefore when for ſeveral Weeks I had lived more privately and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiredly in <hi>London,</hi> than was uſual, faſting twice or thrice in a Week, or ſometimes more, ſpending my Time in reading the Scriptures, and in Prayer to God, this was a good Preparation of my Mind to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Truth which he was then about to make known to me: I lamented the Errors of my paſt Life, and was deſirous to attain a more excellent Degree of Holineſs than I had diſcovered in the Church

of <hi>England.</hi> In this religious Retirement God knew the Breathings of my Soul, how ſincere I was, and reſigned to him when alone; I wanted him to ſet me free, and to ſpeak Peace and Comfort to my Soul, which was grieved and wearied with the Burden of Sin; for tho' I had ſtrictly conformed my ſelf to the Orders and Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and had kept my ſelf from running into any great or ſcandalous Enormities, the Fear of the Almighty preſerving me, yet ſtill I had not that Reſt and Satisfaction in my ſelf which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, and greatly longed for; I found when I had examined my State and Condition to God-ward, that Things were not right with me.</p>
                  <p>As for a ſober and plauſible Converſation in the Eye of the World, I knew that was a very eaſy Attainment, a good natural Temper, with the Advantage of a literal Education, will quickly furniſh a Man with Abilities for that, ſo that he ſhall be looked upon as a Saint, and very ſpiritual, when perhaps in Chains of Darkneſs, in the Gall of Bitterneſs, and in the very Bond of Iniquity: If this Sort of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs would have done, perhaps I might make as fair Pretenſions that Way as ſome others; but alas, I quickly ſaw the Emptineſs and Unſatisfactorineſs of thoſe Things: This is a Covering that will not protect or hide us from the Wrath of the Almighty when he comes to Judgment: 'Tis not a Man's natural Temper, nor his Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that makes him a good Chriſtian; this is not the Righteouſneſs which the Goſpel calls for, nor is this the Truth in the inward Parts which God requires; the Heart and Affections muſt be cleanſed and purified before we can be acceptable to God; therefore it was Death to me to think of taking up my Reſt in a formal Pretence of Holineſs, wherein yet I ſaw to my Grief Abundance of People wrapt themſelves, ſlept ſecurely and quietly, Dreaming of the Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Paradice, as if Heaven were now their own, and they needed not trouble themſelves any more about Religion: I could not enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſo dangerous an Opinion as this, for then I ſhould be tempted to take up my Reſt by the Way, whilſt I was travelling towards the promiſed Land. I think I made a little Progreſs in a holy Life, and thro' God's Aſſiſtance I weakned ſome of my ſpiritual Enemies whilſt I lived in the Communion of the National Church. I thank my God I can truly ſay, whilſt I uſed thoſe Prayers I did it with Zeal and Sincerity, in his Fear and Dread, but ſtill I ceaſed not my earneſt Supplication to him in private, that he would ſhew me Something more excellent, that I might get a compleat Victory over all my Luſts and Paſſions, and might perfect Righteouſneſs before him; for I found a great many Sins and Weakneſſes daily attending me: And tho' I made frequent Reſolutions to forſake thoſe Sins, yet ſtill the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was too ſtrong for me, ſo that often I had Cauſe to complain with the Apoſtle in the Bitterneſs of my Soul, <hi>O wretched Man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the Body of this Death!</hi> Who ſhall ſet me free, and give me Strength to triumph over Sin, the World, and the Devil? That I may in every Thing pleaſe God, and there may not be the leaſt Thought, Word, or Motion, Geſture, or Action, but what is exactly agreeable to his moſt holy Will, as if I ſaw him ſtanding before me, and as if I were to be judged by him for the Thought of my Heart next Moment. O Divine Life! O Seraphick Soul! O that I could always ſtand here! for here is no Reflection, no Sorrow, no Repentance! but at God's Right-Hand there is perfect Peace, and a River of unſpeakable Joy. O that we might imitate the Life of Jeſus, and be throughly furniſhed unto every good Word and Work! This was the frequent Breathing of my Soul to God when I was in the Country, but more eſpecially after I had left my new

Preferment of a Chaplain, and took private Lodgings in <hi>London:</hi> In this Retirement I hope I may ſay, without Boaſting, that I was very devout and religious, and I found great Comfort and Refreſhment in it from the Lord, who let me ſee the Beauty of Holineſs; and the Sweetneſs that ariſes from an humbled mortified Life, was then ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pleaſant to my Taſte, and I rejoiced in it more than in all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and Pleaſures of the World.</p>

As for the <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſo called, I was ſo great a Stranger to them, that I had never read any of their Books, nor do I remember, that ever I converted with any one Man of that Communion in my whole Life: I think there was one in <hi>Foxly</hi> while I was Curate there, but I never ſaw the Man, tho' I went ſeveral Times to his Houſe on Purpoſe to talk with him, and to bring him off from his mad and wild Enthuſiaſm, as I then ignorantly thought it to be: As for that Way, I knew it was every where ſpoken againſt; he that had a Mind to appear more witty and ingenious than the reſt, would chuſe this for the Subject of his profane Jeſts and Drollery; with this he makes Sport, and diverts the Company; for a <hi>Quaker</hi> is but another Name for a Fool or a Mad-man, and was ſcarce ever mention'd but with Scorn and Contempt. As for Drollery, I conſeſs I was never any great Friend to it; but indeed if all was true that was laid to the <hi>Quakers</hi> Charge, I thought that they were ſome of the worſt People that ever appeared in the World, and wondred with what Face they could call themſelves Chriſtians, ſince I was told they denied the fundamental Articles of the holy Faith, to which I ever bore the higheſt Veneration and Eſteem; and notwithſtanding I had always lived at the greateſt Diſtance from that People, and was very zealous in the Worſhip of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and upon all Occaſions would ſpeak very honourably of it, moreover was content to ſuffer ſome few Inconveniences upon that Account, (as thou very well knoweſt) yet my Father ſtill look'd upon me as inclining to the <hi>Quakers;</hi> and ſome Years ago ſignified to a Friend, he was afraid I would become an Enthuſiaſt; and whilſt I was at <hi>Bungan</hi> School, he ſent me two Books to read that were writ againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> one of which was <hi>John; Foldo's,</hi> who hath been ſufficiently expoſed for it by <hi>William Penn.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whilſt I lived in <hi>London</hi> in that private retired Manner (I was juſt now ſpeaking of) walking very humbly in the Sight of God, and having Opportunity to reflect upon my paſt Life, as I had Oca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to be one Day at a Bookſeller's Shop, I happened to caſt my Eye on <hi>Barclay's</hi> Works; and having heard in the Country, that he was a Man of great Account amongſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> I had a Mind to ſee what their Principles were, and what Defence they could make for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for ſure, thought I, theſe People are not ſo ſilly and ridiculous, nor Maintainers of ſuch horrid Opinions, as the Author of the <hi>Snake,</hi> and ſome others would make us believe. I took <hi>Barclay</hi> home with me, and I read him thro'in a Week's Time, ſave a little Treatiſe at the End, which I found to be very philoſophical, I omitted; but however I ſoon read enough to convince me of my own Blindneſs and Ignorance in the Things of God; there I found a Light to break in upon my Mind, which did mightily reſreſh and comfort me in that poor, low, and humbled State, in which I then was; for indeed I was then, and had been for a conſiderable Time before, very hungry

and thirſty after Rightcouſneſs, and therefore I received the Truth with all Readineſs of Mind; 'twas like Balm to my Soul, and as Showers of Rain to the thirſty Earth, which is parched with Heat and Drought. This Author laid Things down ſo plainly, and proved them with ſuch Ingenuity and Dexterity of Learning, and opened the Scriptures ſo clearly to me, that without ſtanding to cavil, diſpute, raiſe Argument or Objection., or conſulting with Fleſh and Blood, I preſently reſigned my ſelf to God, and weeping for Joy that I had found ſo great a Treaſure, I often thanked him with Tears in my Eyes for ſo kind a Viſitation of his Love, that he was graciouſly pleaſed to look to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward me when my Soul cried after him; ſo, tho' before I was in great Doubt and Trouble of Mind, not knowing which way to determine my ſelf, yet now the Sun breaking out ſo powerfully upon me, the Clouds were ſcattered: I was now fully ſatisfied in my own Mind which Way I ought to go, and to what Body of People I ſhould join my ſelf.</p>
                  <p>So I immediately left the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and went to <hi>Gracious-ſtreet</hi> Meeting. After I had read <hi>Barclay,</hi> I read ſome other Books of that Kind, among which was an excellent Piece, tho' in a ſmall Volume, called, <hi>No Croſs, no Crown:</hi> Thus I continued reading and frequenting Meetings for ſeveral Weeks together, but did not let any one Soul know what I was about: The firſt Man I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with was <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> and this was ſeveral Weeks after I began to read <hi>Barclay,</hi> and frequent their Meetings: By him I was introduced into more Acquaintance, and ſtill the farther I went, the more I liked their Plainneſs, and the Decency and Simplicity of their Converſation: They do not uſe the Ceremonies and Salutations of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but ſhake Hands freely, and converſe together as Brothers and Siſters that are ſprung of the ſame Royal Seed, and made Kings and Prieſts unto God.

Choice of my Perſuaſion, and Way of returning my Acknowledgments to him. I wiſh that all, who make any Pretenſions to Religion, would make Uſe of this noble Faculty with Subjection to the Divine Will, to determine their Choice in this grand Affair; and not let the Religion of their Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be that of their Judgment. If People were thus truly wiſe unto their own Salvation, and did not too lazily reſign thmſelves to the Conduct of their Guide, thereby regarding more their Eaſe than Safety, they would not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be the better able to give a Reaſon of the Hope that is in them, but they would ſhew more Warmth in their Devotion, more Charity in their Religion, and more Piety in their Converſation than at preſent they do.</p>
                  <p>When I was viſited ſome Time ago by the chaſtiſing Hand of the Lord for Sin, and my Diſobedience to his holy Will, I laboured under great Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mind and Anguiſh of Spirit; and tho' I was conſtant above many in my Attendance on the publick Prayers of the Church, ſtrict in my Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of its Ceremonies, and exceeding frequent in the Uſe of private Devotion, yet my Barden encreaſed, and I waxed worſe.</p>

            <p>The Animoſities mention'd in this Addreſs, did regard the Diviſion, which having been a good while among the Subjects, began to encreaſe, as many thought by the Change of the Miniſtry. But this being out of my Province, I won't meddle with it.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1712 died <hi>Richard Cromwel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1712 <hi>Death of</hi> R. Cromwel</note> the Son of <hi>Oliver</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, about the Age of ninety Years. Great Changes this Man had ſeen, having himſelf been the ſupreme Ruler of <hi>England,</hi> as hath been mention'd in due Place.</p>
            <p>Altho' I do not intend to relate much more of any Occurrences, becauſe I haſten towards a Concluſion, yet I think it worth the while to add the following Caſe;</p>
            <p>In the Year 1713,<note place="margin">1713 Juſtice <hi>Penry</hi> proſecuted on the Act againſt Occaſional Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity.</note> in the Spring, there was a Suit at Law; on the Act againſt <hi>Occaſional Conformity.</hi> It happened that one <hi>John Penry,</hi> a Juſtice of Peace of <hi>Ailborough,</hi> in the County of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> going to the Pariſh Church, underſtood by the Way, that no Service was to be done there at that Time; but hearing that there was a <hi>Quakers</hi> Meeting there, he went to it. One <hi>Wall,</hi> the Bailiff of the Place, being informed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, imagined that the ſaid Juſtice might not go there, becauſe of the aforeſaid Act, and therefore thinking that ſomething might be gained by it, got Witneſſes to declare that the ſaid Juſtice had been in the Meeting; and ſaid afterwards in a boaſting Way to him, <hi>Now I have book'd you.</hi> To which the other reply'd, <hi>I'll ſtand to it.</hi> The Bailiff then entered his Suit in the Name of one that lived thereabouts by Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. When the Caſe was pleaded at the Seſſions, the Judge, who was Baron <hi>Salath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>el Lovel,</hi> declared the Meaning of the fore-mentioned Act to be thus, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That it did not regard any who accidentally went into a Meeting of Diſſenters; but that it was againſt thoſe who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with the Church, thereby to qualify themſelves for an Office, without changing their Religion.</q> But this was Quite another Caſe; for the Prieſt of the Pariſh himſelf, gave a Certificate that the ſaid Juſtice was a good Member of the Church. From hence it appeared that this Suit was meer Malice; and the Informers or Witneſſes were brought to that Pinch, that they durſt not expect the Verdict of the Jury, for fear that they ſhould have been condemned to pay the Charges; and therefore they let the Thing fall. Being now entred into this Year, I can't omit to ſay, that a Peace between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> being concluded, and the Subjects from all Parts of the Nation congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Queen with Addreſſes, the <hi>Quakers</hi> did not omit alſo to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent an Addreſs; being as follows;</p>

                        <p>We are therefore ſorrowfully affected with the Unhappineſs of thoſe our Countrymen who have ſo little Gratitude or Goodneſs, as to be uneaſie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſo juſt and mild an Adminiſtration: Nor can we reflect on the late unjuſt and unnatural Rebellion, without concluding the Promoters thereof, and Actors therein, were Men infatuated, and hurried by ſuch an Evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as would lay waſte and deſtroy both the Civil and Religious Liberties of theſe Proteſtant Nations.</p>

To behold a Prince upon the Throne, ſolicitous for the Eaſe and Happineſs of his People beyond my other Views, ſo heightens our Satisfaction and Joy, that We want Words to expreſs our full Senſe thereof. And therefore We can do no leſs than aſſure the King, That as it is our Duty to demean our ſelves towards the King's Perſon and Government with all faithful Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſo we are determined, by Divine Aſſiſtance, devoutly and heartily to pray the God and Father of all our Mercies, To vouchſafe unto the King a Long, Peaceable and Proſperous Reign: And that when it ſhall pleaſe the Almighty to remove from Us ſo precious a Life, by taking it to Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, there may not want a Branch of Thy Royal Family endowed with Wiſdom and Virtue to fill the Throne, till Time ſhall be no more.</p>

               <hi>IN the</hi> Preface <hi>to this Hiſtory, Mention is made of a certain Book intituled,</hi> The Light upon the Candleſtick, <hi>publiſhed in the Name (as many ſuppoſed) of</hi> William Ames, <hi>yet no ways writ by him, tho' it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains his Doctrine, but by a certain Learned Man, unwilling to be known publickly, and as it ſeems to me writ originally in</hi> Latin; <hi>which, tho' printed, being in but few Hands, I have thought fit to reprint.</hi>

            <p>And the Original in <hi>Latin</hi> ſoon after the firſt Publication being tranſlated into <hi>Engliſh</hi> by <hi>B. F.</hi> was printed in the Year <hi>1663,</hi> from which Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation take it as follows, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <div type="excerpt_from_book">
               <head>The Light upon the Candleſtick.</head>
               <p>THings are not for Words, but Words for Things: If therefore we underſtand Things aright, and as they ought, by Words, it muſt be by ſuch as are fit to imprint the Things themſelves in thoſe to whom they ſhould occur, and then it were enough (to make known our Thoughts to others as we conceive them) only to make uſe of ſuch Words.</p>
               <p>But foraſmuch as we find the Matter in this Caſe far otherwiſe, and that two Men ſpeaking or writing the ſame Words, may nevertheleſs have different, yea, ſometimes contrary Thoughts, the Diſability of performing this fitly by Words or Diſcourſe is clearly inferred. Nor may we at all wonder at it, ſeeing we know to what a perpetual Change Languages are ſubject, even ſuch, that the very Words may be changed from their priſtine Signification. And the Imperfection is ſo great, that whoſoever ſhould have invented them, ſuch as now they are in Uſe, we ſhould certainly believe that he had little or no Knowledge of thoſe Things that are thereby intended to be ſignified. So that if we would better expreſs Things unto another by Words and Speeches, we had need find new Words, and conſequently a whole new Language: But that would be a Toil and Labour indeed.</p>
               <p>In the mean while we ſee what a Sea of Confuſion flows from hence upon all Mankind: For altho' there ſhould be none, who ſometimes through Ignorance, and ſometimes by Subtilty or Wickedneſs might wreſt or pervert Words contrary to the Mind of the Speaker or Writer, in ſuch Manner as themſelves that ſo do ſhould think beſt for their own Ends, from whence conſequently all this Deceit, Slandering, Contention, and the like proceeds; yet ſo it is, that how uprightly or prudently ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a Man goes to Work in this Matter, he nevertheleſs finds himſelf liable to miſlead, or to be mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <pb n="689" facs="unknown:003104_0700_0FEFF9F149CEFC80"/>But although the Caſe be thus with Words and Diſcourſes at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in Uſe, yet for all that, they are the moſt ready, and ſo far as I know, the fitteſt Means to make known all our Thoughts unto others by: And for this Reaſon therefore, tho' ſo much Confuſion and Deceit happen to ariſe from hence, that no Man that hath any Experience can be ignorant thereof: Yet may we not (therefore) be too much afraid of them neither, as many yet do manifeſt themſelves to be, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have ſome Experience hereof, are apt to believe we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to deceive them, eſpecially if they be but forewarned thereof.</p>
               <p>This, as in many Things, ſo it hath chiefly taken Place in that which is commonly eſteemed for Religion: In which 'tis ſo with moſt Men, that they will ſcarce give Audience to, much leſs take into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration any Thing held forth unto them, by any whom they judge not to be of their own Opinion, as they imagine, to avoid being thereby deluded.</p>
               <p>Yet if they were thus towards their own Party, we might think it was an Act of Prudence, and that they would ſee with their own Eyes: But no, in no wiſe, this is too hard a Task: Whatſoever cometh on that Side, is received with ſuch Partiality for good and current Coin, as if there were no Danger nor Poſſibility of Erring: Whereas nevertheleſs it is all alike with the one as with the other Opinion. It all depends but upon a Poſſibility of being neareſt to the Truth; And for the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding every one his own Opinion, and defending it againſt others, there is ſo much ado, ſo much Pains taken, ſo much Scholaſtick Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Study and Diſputing, that one would rather believe that there were no true Religion at all, than that this ſhould needs be it.</p>
               <p>Seeing then 'tis thus at preſent, can we much blame the Common People, that they deſpair of ever being able to ſolve this Difficulty, and are glad when they can but find any that are greedy of the Work, upon whom they may caſt the whole Burthen? Surely no: For he that ſees but a little clearly, ſees, that there is always Contention behind, and no End till a Man grows weary of it: Nor is the Conqueſt juſt his that hath Truth, but that can beſt handle his Tongue. A miſerable Thing if it were thus to be fought and found! But it is not ſo with the True Religion.</p>
               <p>Go to then, O Man, whoever thou art, we will not draw thee off from one Society of Men, to carry thee over unto another, 'tis ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what elſe we invite thee to. Lend us but a little Audience: Surely thou knoweſt thus much, That as it is an Extremity to receive all Things without Diſtinction, that preſent themſelves to us; ſo 'tis no leſs to reject all Things without Judgment. We invite thee to ſomething which may be a Means whereby to attain to thy own Salvation and Well-being: Be as diſtruſtful, or rather prudent or foreſighted as thou wilt, thou canſt not in Reaſon refuſe us thy Ear in this Thing: All the Damage thou canſt poſſibly have by doing that which we exhort thee to, is only to have taken a little Pains in vain, if that which is promiſed ſhould not ſucceed: Whereas on the contrary, if it ſhould ſucceed, thou mayeſt come to the Enjoyment of a Matter of ſo great Worth, that would not be exchanged for all that is eſteemed great in the Earth. Moreover, 'tis not far to ſeek, but at hand, 'tis <hi>nigh</hi> thee, yea and in thy ſelf. And there thou mayeſt experience the Trial of that which we declare, which is the moſt certain and ſure that can be deſired.</p>
               <p>We direct thee then to <hi>within thy ſelf,</hi> that is, that thou oughteſt to turn into, to mind and have Regard unto that which is <hi>within thee,</hi> to wit, <hi>The Light of Truth, the true Light which enlighteneth every Man that cometh into the World.</hi> Here 'tis that thou muſt be, and not <hi>without</hi> thee. Here thou ſhalt find a Principle certain and infallible,
<pb n="690" facs="unknown:003104_0701_0FEFF9F55958E440"/>
and whereby encreaſing and going on therein, thou mayeſt at length ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive unto a happy Condition: Of this thou mayſt ſafely adventure the Trial, But it thou dareſt not do ſo much, 'tis hard to help thee. And if thou happeneſt to be one of thoſe that wouldſt it know all Things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou doſt begin, yea, even thoſe Things which are experienced in a Condition to which thou art ſo much a Stranger, that there's nothing in thee hath ſo much Agreement therewith, as to comprehend it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Truth: Know this, Thou doſt (therein) juſt as thoſe that would learn to Read, without knowing the Letters.</p>
               <p>To deſire to know all Things that we are capable of, is good and laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: But to go further, is Folly. There will be always ſomething elſe to ask, and our Knowledge will ever be too ſhort. He that will not adventure till he be fully ſatisfied, ſhall never begin, much leſs finiſh it to his own Salvation.</p>
               <p>But we judge it needful, as much as in us lies, to open unto you that unto which we do exhort you, that People may underſtand what it properly is.</p>
               <p>We ſay then, That we exhort every ene to turn in to the <hi>Light</hi> that is in him, (We give it rather the Appellation of <hi>Light,</hi> than any Thing elſe, otherwiſe it is all one to us whether ye call it <hi>Chriſt, the Spirit, the Word,</hi> &amp;c. ſeeing theſe all denote but one and the ſame Thing:) Yet the Word <hi>Light</hi> being in its natural Signification ſomewhat elſe than that which we intend thereby, we ſhall therefore in brief endeavour clearly to expreſs what we intend under this Denomination,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Light</hi> (then we ſay) <hi>is a clear and diſtinct Knowledge of Truth in the Underſtanding of every Man, by which he is ſo convinced of the Being and Quality of Things, that he cannot poſſibly doubt thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From this Definition which is here given of the <hi>Light,</hi> 'tis clear, that it muſt needs comprehend in it the principal Effect of ſhewing us, and giving us the Knowledge of what is <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Falſhood,</hi> what is <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil;</hi> which verify is a Matter of ſo great Concernment, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it Men muſt needs ſwerve up and down in continual Darkneſs.

<pb n="691" facs="unknown:003104_0702_0FEFF9F82BA99CC0"/>
Soul, the Memory is ſo filled, that nothing elſe can enter. The Eyes and Ears ſtand ſo perpetually open to all Things, that they never want an Object to bring to Mind the Experience of that which pleaſed the Body ſo well; And this ſtirs up the Deſire to enjoy it, yet all Without Satiety: The Objects they are multifarious, the Enjoyment can be but ſingle and tranſient, and the Cauſes inceſſant.</p>
               <p>Now where this operateth in us after this Manner, by Education and Example in Manners and Cuſtoms which are regulated by Opinion, and not by the <hi>True Light,</hi> that Men live altogether therein; is it any Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that here (in theſe Men) there is ſo little, or no Operation of the <hi>Light?</hi> Not at all.</p>
               <p>We are ſo involved into the Deſire of that which is high in the World, ſo overwhelmed in Pleaſures, that it's almoſt impoſſible for the <hi>Light</hi> to cauſe one Deſire after <hi>Good</hi> to ſpring or bubble up.</p>
               <p>Where then theſe ſo contrary Operations to the <hi>Light</hi> are, there it can never break through.</p>
               <p>According to the Nature and Kind of every Thing, is the Operation thereof: Where they are oppoſite, the one muſt give way unto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that which is moſt powerful prevails: from whence alſo the Effects thereof become moſt viſible. The LIGHT notwithſtanding, abides always the ſame, and therefore altho' Man by Sin, thro' his Love and Union to corruptible Things, comes to periſh, be damned, and miſs of his everlaſting Happineſs, the <hi>Light</hi> nevertheleſs which is in <hi>every Man that comes into the World,</hi> abides forever unchangeable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Light is alſo the firſt Principle of Religion.</hi> For, ſeeing there can be no true Religion without the Knowledge of God, and no Knowledge of God without this <hi>Light,</hi> Religion muſt neceſſarily have this <hi>Light</hi> for its Principle.</p>
               <p>God being then known by this <hi>Light,</hi> according to the Meaſure of Knowledge which the finite and circumſcribed Creature can have of the infinite and uncircumſcriptible Creator, Man hath obtained a <hi>firm Foundation,</hi> upon which he may build all firm and laſting Things: A Principle whereby he may without ever erring, guide the whole Courſe of his Life, how he is to carry himſelf towards God, his Neighbour, and himſelf, and all Things elſe, whereby he may happily attain unto his Soul's Salvation, which conſiſteth only in <hi>Union with God.</hi> And thus this <hi>Light</hi> is therefore the firſt Principle of Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Without this Light, there is no Power or Ability at all in M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> to do any Good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This muſt firſt raiſe him and quicken him out of the Death of Sin. 'Tis Folly to expect any thing, Where nothing is; there's no Effect with out a Cauſe: There muſt be ſomething then which muſt cauſe a Man to act, if he does any Thing.</p>
               <p>And this Cauſe muſt have in it whatſoever the Effect produced hath in it: As for Example, if the Effects of <hi>Light</hi> be produced, <hi>Light</hi> muſt do it, and nothing elſe.</p>
               <p>And therefore, is it not a ſilly Thing that all Men would have People do this or that as Good, and leave this or that as Evil, becauſe they tell them ſo, without any more ado, or at beſt aſſigning only the accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Motives wherefore, and think they have Reaſon too, juſt as if this were enough? Who can ſee ſuch Effects as are hereby required, included in this Cauſe? Not I, for my Part.</p>
               <p>Experience alſo teacheth us the ſame; elſe how could it all paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in a Train and Cuſtom, without any Fruit? <hi>Theſe are therefore not the right Means:</hi> But ſuch we muſt endeavour to furniſh People with. Means from whence Power may iſſue forth to do that which they are exhorted to. Such is the Nature of Man, that he is moved to chuſe
<pb n="692" facs="unknown:003104_0703_0FEFF9FA4BA00748"/>
that which he judgeth to be beſt, before the worſt, and is always wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to change for the beſt.</p>
               <p>Now if it ſo happens (as for the moſt Part it doth) that a Man chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the worſt before the beſt, 'tis for want of Knowledge, and contrary to his Aim, and ſo he erreth, not being led by the <hi>True Light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here then it ſhould be begun; 'tis eaſie leading a Man to that which of himſelf he is deſirous of: If thoſe now who make it their Work to teach others, <hi>were but led themſelves by the True Light,</hi> knowing better Things than thoſe to which the Multitude are link'd ſo faſt with Love, they would be able to hold them forth clearly to others: And ſo making it their continual Work, it were impoſſible their Labour ſhould be fruitleſs; for People knowing better, would do better. Who remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers not the Play of our Youth, how much we were in Love therewith, and yet how ridiculous is it now unto us but to think upon it? And why? Becauſe we now know that which we judge better: <hi>Hence,</hi> not by Force, but very lightly, and of it ſelf, they came from Time to Time to be worn out, and paſs away, that there is now no Deſire nor Motion, moving thereunto. How may we think then it would be, if the Soul came but once to apprehend thoſe Things aright which are durable and uncorruptible, and which infinitely tranſcend all bodily Toys in Worth? So far as thoſe Things then ſhould come to be eſteemed more glorious than all bodily Things, ſo much the more powerful would be the Annihilation of thoſe Things in which all Men, even to old Age, yea, Death it ſelf, do take ſo much Delight; and then we might hope and expect that thoſe Things which are (indeed) alone worthy to be known, would gain Entrance, and being brought forth in the <hi>Light,</hi> would be alſo owned and received by every one, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Meaſure in which they ſhould ſtand in the ſame <hi>Light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence from within, the Amendment and Converſion is to be waited for, from within it muſt begin, if with a Foundation; the outward then will follow of it ſelf: The Weakeſt muſt give way to the Strongeſt, all depends but upon the Knowledge of ſomething better, to make a true and laſting Change. Therefore to hold this forth to Men, is the beſt Thing we can give them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Light is the Inward Ear, by which alone, and by no other, the Voice of God,</hi> viz. <hi>the Truth, can be heard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this alone muſt the Senſe and Mind of him that would ſignifie any Thing by Words, or any outward Sign, be comprehended and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand. <hi>So that if the Truth of God</hi> be preſented to a Man who ſtands not in the <hi>Light of Truth,</hi> 'tis impoſſible he ſhould underſtand it, altho' he hears and comprehends the Words after his Manner, yet he is ſtill fenced off from the true Senſe and Meaning thereof.</p>
               <p>Hence therefore it is, that among ſo many Hearers there are ſo few that have Ears to hear.</p>
               <p>He that hears <hi>Truth</hi> aright, that is, underſtands it well, muſt not ſtand out of, but in the <hi>Truth</hi> it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Therefore neither is it any Wonder that all Men do not underſtand and conceive thoſe Things that are brought forth by the <hi>Light.</hi> Thoſe only that ſtand in it are alone (and no other) capable thereof.</p>
               <p>The Caſe being thus, we ſee of how great Concernment it is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to exhort and excite Men to turn in to the <hi>Light</hi> that is in them, that ſo they may go on to ſuch a Condition and Meaſure therein, as to be fit to underſtand aright <hi>the Word,</hi> that is, the <hi>Truth of God,</hi> becauſe out of this there can be nothing underſtood and concluded from the Words and Writings given forth from the <hi>Light,</hi> but meer Opinions, and conſequently Errors, <hi>This Light Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. is the <hi>Truth and Word of God,</hi> as hath been already ſaid, and every where appears by what we
<pb n="693" facs="unknown:003104_0704_0FEFF9FDD30E0188"/>
have hitherto laid down: <hi>For this is a living Word, and tranſlateth Man from Death to Life, is powerful, and enableth a Man to hear witneſs of it every where.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This is alſo the true Rule according unto which all our Actions are to be ſquared.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This hath the Preheminence before any Writing, Scripture, Doctrine, or any Thing elſe that we meet with from without. <hi>We are born in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World,</hi> and brought up as every Body knows: From the very firſt we hear Differences, every one pretends that he knows the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and hath Truth: One holds forth this, another That to us: <hi>If now the Light which is in every Man that comes into the World,</hi> ſhall not be Judge, whither ſhall we rowl? To believe all, is impoſſible; to reject all, no leſs: Who ſhall be judge here? Who elſe can be but the <hi>Light</hi> within us? For whatſoever comes from without, is the Thing to be judged of: Who then fitter? ſeeing this is infallible.</p>
               <p>Again, is not this (the <hi>Light)</hi> that by which we muſt ſee and know God, and ſo conſequently that by which we muſt judge all Things Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine? Certainly 'tis: Then it follows alſo, That we can judge of no Doctrine, of no Book that is Divine, but by this <hi>Light;</hi> and judging it thereby to be divine, it cannot but be truly ſo. As for Example, if we experience that the Book called the BIBLE, in regard of tne Divine Doctrine therein compriſed, hath ſuch an <hi>Harmony with that in which God</hi> is known, that he muſt needs have been the Author of it; there cannot rationally any more powerful Demonſtration be demanded. With them that are thus, <hi>the Scripture may become living and powerful, and not a dead Letter,</hi> as it muſt needs be to thoſe Men who have no Feeling of this Thing. And from hence then it is apparent, ſeeing this Light muſt be preferred to all Things whatſoever that we meet with from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, that then <hi>Man muſt firſt of all be directed to this:</hi> For without it what Profit is there (I pray) to be reaped any where by any external Sign but by it. Lay the Book of the Scripture freely before any Man, let him alſo have all the Fitneſs (the Univerſities can give him) to look into it in its proper Language in which it may have firſt been written, what will all be without the <hi>Light?</hi> Nothing. <hi>The Letters, the Words are not the Scriptures,</hi> but the Mind alone is the Scripture, and this Meaning can never be truly and juſtly hit, but by thoſe alone that ſtand in the ſame <hi>Light,</hi> out of which the Scriptures proceeded.</p>
               <p>Theſe are they then to whom the Scripture is a <hi>Co-witneſs,</hi> and as a Seal of their being Sons of God; while by Experience they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> in which the Saints formerly were,</hi> who ſpake and writ all thoſe Things comprehended in the Book of the Scripture; <hi>theſe then have the true Underſtanding and Meaning of the Scriptures,</hi> not thoſe that <hi>imagine unto themſelves a Meaning</hi> by Opinion and Gueſs, thro' a thouſand Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, without the leaſt Aſſurance of not erring; which becomes the very Ground of all Jangling and Contention.</p>
               <p>In fine, <hi>This Light in every Man is the Means to come to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God.</hi> And ſeeing all external Signs muſt needs preſuppoſe this Knowledge, therefore itſelf muſt needs be immediate, without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Sign: That Signs muſt preſuppoſe ſuch a Knowledge, is undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: for theſe Signs muſt either be <hi>Words or Effects, Works or Miracles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If Words,</hi> we ſee at firſt an Impoſſibility in the Thing it ſelf: For <hi>Words are created and finite,</hi> and God who ſhould make known himſelf by them, <hi>uncreated and infinite:</hi> And therefore here is ſo infinite a Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that there is no <hi>Manner</hi> of Agreement, nor any <hi>Thing</hi> in the Words by which they might be capable to do it. But again, if you fly to the <hi>Meaning</hi> of the Words, as being fit for ſuch a Thing, then that which we ſay will more manifeſtly appear: As put caſe for Example<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake,
<pb n="694" facs="unknown:003104_0705_0FEFFA019E385018"/>
that GOD about to make known himſelf by Words, ſhould ſay, I AM GOD, and that this ſhould be the Sign by which he would make himſelf known, we ſee clearly, that it would be impoſſible for a Man at firſt to know God by this; For if he ſhould comprehend any Thing out of the Senſe of the Words, he muſt needs formerly have had the Signification of the Word GOD, and what he is to underſtand by it: In like Manner, if God maketh his Will known to Man, <hi>the Knowledge of God</hi> (which hath its Original from the <hi>True Light) muſt precede and convince him,</hi> that that (Manifeſtation) can be from none but God alone, whereupon he is then ſufficiently aſſured.</p>
               <p>If by <hi>Effects</hi> (or <hi>outward miraculous Works)</hi> 'tis the ſame Thing; for theſe are no leſs <hi>created,</hi> no leſs <hi>finite:</hi> And tho' we might obſerve ſomething in the Nature of a Thing, which might be too difficult for the Power of any Creature, which we know, to effect; yet this at the utmoſt would be but a Demonſtration taken from our <hi>Impotency</hi> and not from <hi>the Nature and all the Operations of it;</hi> and this Kind of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration cannot be certain and ſtable, till we were able clearly and diſtinctly to ſee that there was <hi>not a Concurrency of many Cauſes</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch an Effect, but that it muſt needs have been cauſed by an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and unlimited Cauſe,</hi> whom we call God: But who knoweth this? Or who can declare it?</p>
               <p>Add to this, <hi>That the Knwoledge of God in all Things muſt firſt be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Knowledge of any Creature</hi> or particular Thing; ſo that no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Thing without this can be well known; and conſequently is altogether uncapable to come to know God by, or certainly to make known himſelf to Man by.</p>
               <p>Go to then, <hi>Without</hi> thy ſelf, O Man, thou haſt no Means to look for, by which thou mayeſt know God. <hi>Thou muſt abide within thy ſelf, to the Light that is in thee</hi> thou muſt turn thee, there thou wilt find it, And no where elſe.</p>
               <p>God is, <hi>conſidered</hi> in himſelf, <hi>neareſt unto thee and every Man.</hi> He that goes forth of himſelf to any Creature, thereby to know God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts from God, and ſo much the further, an he comes more to admire the Creature, and ſtand in Contemplation thereof, to miſtake himſelf by it, This thou muſt then <hi>ſhun</hi> and the contrary <hi>mind,</hi> viz. <hi>Mind the Light that is in thee,</hi> by it to work, unmoveably and faithfully to perſevere.</p>
