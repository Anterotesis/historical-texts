            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the <hi>CITIZENS</hi> of PENNSYLVANIA.</head>
            <p>IT is with great reluctance I venture to claim the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of my fellow citizens; nothing but neceſſity could urge me to it at any time; but more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſince it appeared probable that our enemies derived hope from ſowing diviſions amongſt the whigs of America. Under this idea, I have patiently and ſilently ſeen my name held out to my country more than once, as if I had purſued a line of conduct incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the general intereſt, altho' I knew the inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations to be perfectly groundleſs, and that it was in my power to refute them. I expected that you, my fellow-citizens, would readily diſcover the private reaſons which produced theſe attacks, and, until that moment ſhould arrive, conſoled myſelf in the conſciouſneſs of innocence and integrity. But as the frequent inſertion of my name in an unfavourable light may at length make ſtrong im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions on thoſe who are not perſonally acquainted with me, I mean to give a plain narrative of ſuch facts as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the charges or inſinuations made againſt me, in as conciſe a manner as I am capable of. The firſt that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member was reſpecting the ſtate of my accounts with the continent, in anſwer to which I promiſed, in a former publication, either a ſettlement, or a report of a commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee on that ſubject. Soon after this a very ſerious charge of a criminal nature was brought againſt me in Congreſs. The matter was fully and minutely inveſtigated, and I not only proved my innocence to the perfect ſatisfaction of that reſpectable body, but even my accuſer himſelf, by examining into the tranſaction, diſcovered a moſt incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtible proof of it, a proof that had eſcaped me and the committee who had been appointed on that occaſion: This he candidly introduced before that honourable bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which, together with their unanimous vote of acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, rendered my intended publication unneceſſary. I then called on Congreſs, by letter to the Preſident, to appoint a committee for inſpecting the ſtate of my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts and tranſactions with the continent. This was readily complied with; but as I was engaged in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Aſſembly of this State, and the attention of the committee appointed occupied by a variety of other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, the matter by mutual conſent was deferred. Soon after this I received advice that goods which had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Weſt-Indies for about two years would be releaſed, which has accordingly happened, and I am now receiving and delivering the ſame to the continent as faſt as they arrive. This circumſtance gives me the proſpect of being able to make a final ſettlement of all my accounts, which I conſider as much preferable to any the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable report of a committee, at the ſame time that it gives them unneceſſary trouble. I ſhall therefore content myſelf with wiſhing that every perſon connected with public buſineſs had ſuch accounts as mine to produce.</p>
            <p>On the 25th of May laſt a Town Meeting was held in the State-Houſe yard, and in the printed account of the proceedings of that day I found my name the only one mentioned as a delinquent, and a committee eſpecially appointed to call on me for an account of my connection with a cargoe then lately arrived in this port. I was very unwell at the time, but the committee called on me in a day or two, when I readily gave them every ſatisfaction in my power. They treated me with complaiſance, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſatisfied; indeed I have been told ſince, that one of the gentlemen declared they were ſo. As they did not call on me again, I wrote them a letter the 26th of June, when the complaint in my eyes began to abate a little, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending then to ſend it: but on being told they ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended calling, I withheld it until this time, and I here inſert a copy, as containing the ſtate of that tranſaction.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>When you did me the honour to call on me about a month ago, agreeable to your appointment by the Town-Meeting held in the State-Houſe yard the 25th of May, you found me afflicted with an inflammation in one of my eyes, that had for ten days preceding rendered me almoſt incapable of buſineſs, and ſuch has been my ſituation from that time to this, or you ſhould ſooner have heard from me, altho' I think it was intimated at parting, by Mr. Smith and Mr. Rittenhouſe, that I was to hear from you again in a few days. It may not be amiſs to mention that, after you had ſignified the buſineſs you came on, I obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that by a publication in that day a paper of the tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at the State-Houſe yard, it appeared I was to give my anſwers in writing, and therefore requeſted that your queſtions might alſo be written. Mr. Matlack ſaid, the committee, being entirely ignorant of the tranſactions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the French polacre's cargoe, wiſhed me to give a general relation of the matter, to enable them to judge whether it was neceſſary to propoſe any and what que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions to me, or whether a general relation of my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge on the ſubject might not be ſufficient. I replied, that I ſhould cheerfully gratify the committee, having done nothing that I was either afraid or aſhamed to have known. Obſerving, that I conſidered this amongſt the number of thoſe unmerited and groundleſs attacks which I had been uſed to of late, and which I expected would, like the reſt, end to my honour, rather than diſadvantage.</p>
                  <p>I then aſſured the committee, and now repeat it, that I never moved hand, foot or tongue, to procure the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe in queſtion, that I had not ſought after it myſelf, nor employed any other to do it for me. It was many days in this port before I had the leaſt idea of a connection with it, and when it did come into my view, it was upon the application of other people to me. I ſuppoſe it is a well known fact, that many perſons wanted to get this cargoe, by purchaſe or otherways, into their hands; more than one requeſted me to join them, being particularly induced thereto from a knowledge that I could ſupply the ſhip with the cargoe wanted for her return voyage. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt a gentleman, ſettled in a neighbouring State, a countryman of the ſuper-cargoes, happening to be here at the time, had influence enough to obtain a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of this much ſought for cargoe. This gentleman came and offered me a ſhare in the purchaſe, agreed to put it entirely under my management, and that I ſhould draw a commiſſion on the ſales, provided I would ſupply an outward cargoe for the ſhip. Theſe offers were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and fairly within the line of my buſineſs, ſuch as I preſume no merchant of ability to perform the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would have refuſed. But I inſiſted, that if a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe was made, and I to be intereſted, it ſhould be on ſuch terms as would admit me to ſell reaſonably, and leave the concerned a moderate profit.</p>
                  <p>The gentleman deſired the extent of my terms, which I gave, and as I thought in ſuch clear and explicit terms as did not admit of miſtake. After ſome little time a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain was concluded, and reduced to writing the 3d of May. This writing is in the French language, which I do not underſtand, but being told it was nearly conformable to my terms, I conſented to receive the cargoe. The firſt thing I did was to ſend for thoſe agents who purchaſe for the continent, and offer them whatever was wanted for the army on ſuch terms as they declared very moderate. I gave them the invoice to pick out what they choſe, and they culled about one fourth the value of the whole, but entirely in articles the moſt ſaleable of any in the ſhip. Before the whole of theſe goods were delivered I had a tranſlation of the agreement, and diſcovered that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties had not underſtood each other. I therefore ſtopped all further proceedings, and got them together for expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, when it clearly appeared that my intentions had not been complied with, and that I had not underſtood the bargain in the ſame light the conſignees did, for I had ſold to the public much cheaper than, by their idea of the bargain, they had ſold to the gentleman that contracted with them. Upon full conviction of this, and that the miſunderſtanding was owing to my want of French, and the other gentleman's bad Engliſh, they very honourably agreed to render the bargain void.</p>
                  <p>After this Meſſ. La Caze and Mallet, the ſupercargoes, aſked me to undertake the ſale of their cargoe as a factor, for it was not probable that they, who were entire ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in the country, could manage it properly themſelves. I told them, if they would ratify the ſales I had made to the public, I would accept their propoſal, which they agreed to, and by this means the continent had the public ſupplies out of this cargoe very conſiderably cheaper than could have happened in any other way; for had the purchaſe firſt made been clearly underſtood, the agents muſt have paid twenty prices higher, or if I had acted from the firſt as a factor to the ſupercargoes, I muſt have ſold, as I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards did, under their direction, and to their beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. My agreement to become their factor is dated the 11th May, as you ſaw, for I ſhewed you the original of this, and a tranſlation of the other agreement. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the bargain was verbally made a day or two before, and from that time I proceeded in the ſales, in ſuch a manner as I judged moſt likely to give my employers that ſatisfaction they were entitled to. Their cargoe being bought dear, the advance on the invoice has not been ſo high as on others, the ſaleable articles were ſoon run off, whilſt a great many, unſuited to this ſeaſon and this country, remain on hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This laſt circumſtance not ſuiting the plans and hopes of the ſupercargoes, they made me new propoſals, but it is immaterial to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic whether I accept theſe or not, as an agreement, after the bulk of the cargoe was ſold, could not affect ſuch ſales, and what remains, beſides being unſaleable, will be as ſubject to regulation as any other imported goods are. After giving you this juſt ſtate of my connection with a cargoe that has made ſo much noiſe, I think you will not heſitate to do juſtice to my conduct, if it appears to you in the ſame light it does to every perſon with whom I have converſed on the ſubject. And as Mr. Matlack in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated that it might not be amiſs to give the committee information of the original proprietors of this cargoe, I ſhall ſend herewith Meſſ. LaCaze and Mallet's declaration on that point, alſo their certificate that I have truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated my connection with their cargoe.</p>

White and Mr. Hooper too inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of ſpirit to be ſo influenced; and I ſhall only ſay, if that were not the caſe and I had any pretenſions to influence them, I never had any difference with Mr. Serjeant, nor the leaſt deſire to do him an injury or ill office.</note> on me was made by republiſhing in Mr. Dunlap's Packet of the 3d of June, a piece ſaid to be taken from Rivington's paper, entitled, Memoir in anſwer to the obſervations of M. de la Fere on the bills of Congreſs, &amp;c. dated Edenton, N. Carolina, Jan. 18, 1778, and for the ſatisfaction of my readers I will here recite the paragraph in which I am mentioned. <q>Few are convinced by the aſſurances of Congreſs that paper is equal in value to gold, aſſertions that reaſon and fact deny, and their own members do every thing in their power to confute. Mr. Robert Morris in particular has dared to offer to a perſon of my acquaintance, bills of exchange upon France at the rate of 13 ſols and ſome deniers for a Continental dollar.</q> Who the author of this may be I know not; ſtill leſs his informant; but either the former has been guilty of groſs miſrepreſentation, or the latter of direct falſhood. In January 1778 I had no bills to ſell, nor offered any to ſale. I paid two bills on France in March 1778 for the ballance of an account at the rate of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change that was current when the money came into my hands, and rebought theſe bills in April or May follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at 400 per cent, which was then the higheſt courſe of exchange. The perſon with whom I had this tranſaction now reſides in Philadelphia, and ready to prove the fact. Can it then be believed by any body that I ſhould in Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary, 1778, aſk a dollar for thirteen ſols and ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers of France, which is equal to an exchange of 1200 or 1300 per cet. If it be ſaid the date is miſprinted, and that it ſhould be January, 1779, I anſwer that I ceaſed to be a Member of Congreſs in October, 1778. In January, 1779. I ſold bills as a factor, the higheſt exchange obtained was 900 per cent. and it never was my practice to aſk 300 or 400 per cent. more then the current price, though I might perhaps produce examples in juſtification of ſuch practices, from a quarter not ſuſpected.</p>
            <p>If this writer meant to include me in the paſſage follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I have quoted, he intended me equal injuſtice, for I never ſold to the public any goods but what I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, nor purchaſed any produce of the country but for exportation.</p>
            <p>On the 17th June I was much ſurpriſed at the receipt of the following note:</p>

                  <p>Your letter to Captain Heyſham of yeſterday's date was this morning laid before the committee, who are ſorry your indiſpoſition confines you ſo long, and will with ſatisfaction excuſe your perſonal attendance: In conſequence have directed me to write you notice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; ſame time I am ordered to requeſt you will lay before this committee at ten o'clock to-morrow forenoon, or ſooner if convenient, the original inſtructions or agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by virtue whereof you are purchaſing for his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty's agent, an account of the quantities ſo purchaſed and contracted for, and information by what conveyance and to what places or ſtores ſaid flour is col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and from what places in the country it has been and is now brought.</p>
                  <p>The Committee conſider it their duty to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to you the information which neceſſitates them to make this requeſt, and doubt not but you will judge it a ſufficient reaſon for their conduct, viz. Alexander Wilſon, of Earl townſhip, Lancaſter county, reports, that you, through Matthias Slough of Lancaſter, give 22<abbr>l.</abbr> 10<abbr>s.</abbr> per hundred for flour there, and on oath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares he delivered you ten barrels yeſterday, which he received, by order of Matthias Slough, at Whiteman's mill, Earl townſhip, aforeſaid; and further, that he ſaw Mr. Slough agree with a man at Lancaſter for a quantity of flour at the rate of ſixty dollars per hundred. The Committee perceive how this counteracts the reſolves of the late town meeting, more eſpecially as theſe purchaſes are made ſo nigh the city, and muſt enhance the price greatly in conſequence of the waggon hire, excluſive of a ſuſpicion which prevails concerning Continental teams being employed in that ſervice.</p>

                  <p>I am honoured with a letter from your Secretary pro tempore, Mr. Alexander Boyd, excuſing my perſonal attendance on the Committee, but requeſting me to lay before you at ten o'clock to-morrow forenoon or ſooner if convenient, <q>the original inſtructions or agreements by virtue whereof I am purchaſing for his Moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Majeſty's Agent; an account of the quantity ſo purchaſed and contracted for, and information by what conveyance and to what places or ſtores the ſaid flour
<pb facs="unknown:016377_0002_0F9C8CF4E020A7B8"/>
is collected, and from what places in the country it has been brought.</q> On the receipt of this letter I thought it my duty to communicate the ſame to my em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployer, which I did immediately, with Captain Heyſham's note of yeſterday and my anſwer. Mr. Holker, his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty's Agent in this buſineſs, does not think it proper for me to communicate the things you require, and therefore I am under a neceſſity of referring you to him for ſuch further information as you may wiſh. For my part I am very willing as your fellow citizen to give you, and through you, the public at large, every ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in my power, becauſe I am deſirous of retaining that good opinion I know my conduct deſerves; and upon this principle I venture to aſſure you, the orders to Mr. Slough for purchaſing flour were dated the 27th of January, and confirmed the 17th of February laſt. He was applied to in preference to any other perſon in that county, becauſe he was already a purchaſer for the continent, which prevented any raiſing of prices by contention, as might have happened had another agent been employed. He was limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to exceed the prices given by the continent, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired either to hire public or private teams as he found the tranſportation might be effected cheapeſt. All the letters I have written to him on the ſubject ſince thoſe dates, were only to exhort him to a ſpeedy and full execution of the order. No other purchaſe has been made in this ſtate except in this city under my immediate inſpection, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to verbal orders from my principal from day to day, and this before the meeting in the State-houſe yard. The quantity on hand here is inconſiderable, and I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume you do not wiſh to interfere in what is done in the neighbouring ſtates. Before I cloſe this letter I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not omit mentioning that four or five poor women with ſacks under their arms came to me this morning demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſupplies of flour, alledging they were directed to me by the committee for that purpoſe, and informed by them that I had received two waggon loads of flour from the country yeſterday I confeſs this ſurpriſed me a good deal at firſt, but on reflecting a little it ſeems highly improbable the committee or any of the members could be capable of giving ſuch directions, becauſe ſome of them had before been informed by my clerks that the flour under my care belonged to his Moſt Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and my letter to Captain Heyſham yeſterday con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it; conſequently it muſt be known, I could not deliver it to any perſon but by order of my employers; and I have too good an opinion of your candour to think you would ſend thoſe people where they muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity meet a refuſal, although that very refuſal might raiſe prejudices againſt me.</p>

            <p>Had the Commitee thought proper to conſult me before they paſſed thoſe haſty reſolutions, in the preamble to which they not only imply a cenſure of us, as depreciators of the continental money, but inſinuate that it is done for the ſake of encreaſing the commiſſion, I ſhould have ſhewn them that I had nothing more to do in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular affair than to receive and examine the invoices, and pay for the flour agreeable to order. This being really the caſe, Mr. Holker would have declared it under his hand then as readily as he has done ſince, not being afraid to abide the conſequences of his own conduct; and ſurely under ſuch information, the Committee would not have uttered theſe cenſures againſt me. I would have gone far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and informed them, that from the firſt moment I agreed to aſſiſt Mr. Holker in the buſineſs of his agency, my advice to him was to draw the ſupplies of proviſions wanted for the fleet from the Continental Commiſſaries, rather than purchaſe them himſelf, alledging that flour was ſcarce, the price not only high but likely to riſe; that if he, under theſe circumſtances, employed one ſet of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers, and the continent another, competition would probably take place between them, the prices riſe rapidly, and the blame moſt likely be thrown on him or his Agents. This advice was adopted; Congreſs were applied to, and orders procured for the Commiſſaries to grant the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſupplies. I would aſk whether this advice ſavours of a deſire to increaſe commiſſions, or implies any practices ſuch as the Committee can be no longer ſilent ſpectators of.</p>
            <p>Mr. Holker continued to depend on commiſſarial ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies until repeated diſappointments from almoſt every quarter made him exceedingly uneaſy, and he judged it abſolutely neceſſary to make purchaſes himſelf. My advice was ſtill either to employ the Continental Purchaſing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries, or perſons of ſuch character as might be depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on for prudent good management: This was agreed to, and purſued in every inſtance, Congreſs, or the Committee of Congreſs for the Commiſſary department, being privy to all the meaſures adopted: and we have never heard the charge of raiſing prices until now. Mr. Holker is poſſeſſed of ample materials to ſupport his tranſactions whenever he ſhould think it neceſſary or proper to do ſo. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee ſeem to have conſidered their regulated price of 20<abbr>l.</abbr> per hundred for flour as having extended to Wilming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, which is in another government; and it appears they muſt be right, ſince the Committee of that place have agreed to act ſubordinately to them. Mr. Rumford, who bought the flour, I ſuppoſe had not conceived it in that light, or probably he would not have made the purchaſe.</p>
            <p>In Mr. Henry's letter to me it is ſaid, "We conſider the intereſt of his Moſt Chriſtiain Majeſty, whoſe ſervice you act in, as unneceſſarily ſuffering, by giving greater prices than there are occaſion for." Certainly the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee will perceive that they gave too haſty an aſſent to this paragraph, for they ſurely will not pretend to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine how ſpeedily the exigencies of public affairs may have required the ſupply in queſtion; and they cannot but recollect that the regulation of the price of flour did in the firſt inſtance create a ſcarcity, which induced an applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from them to the Committee of Congreſs for 100 bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of flour to ſerve out to the citizens, as they could not get ſupplied otherwiſe at the regulated price.</p>
            <p>It ſeems to me that the inſinuation conveyed by the words, increaſed commiſſion, ought not to have been ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded againſt a merchant of reputation without the fulleſt evidence, as coming from a public body, who will always be more under the reſtraints of decorum than is perhaps incumbent on every individual. I ſhall notice it, but with that decency of language and ſentiment which it is my duty to myſelf to make uſe of.</p>
            <p>A merchant doubtleſs has it always in view to increaſe his commiſſions, but he muſt know very little of buſineſs indeed, who thinks to do that by raiſing the price of the commodities his employer deals in, for in this he certainly drives him to employ another Factor or ſeek a cheaper market, ſo that he would inevitably fall the victim of his own rapacity. Several gentlemen of the Committee muſt know that I was many years in the receipt of much larger and more extenſive commiſſions for the purchaſe of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce than at preſent, and as that buſineſs increaſed on my hands until the exports from this country were ſtopped, it is evident that my employers were honeſtly and faithfully ſerved. Why then ſhould it be ſuppoſed I would ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly depart from my former practice and principles, and ſacrifice the intereſt of my employer for—for what? For the increaſe of my property by a trifling commiſſion, which, gained on ſuch terms, would neceſſarily reduce the value of my whole fortune, a conſiderable part of which is in Continental paper, and of conſequence, however ſome men may circulate for their own purpoſes that I am a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciator of it, my own private intereſt would of itſelf lead me, were I deficient in better motives, to exert myſelf as I always have done to ſupport and raiſe its value. I have called the proceedings of the Committee on this ſubject haſty, they certainly were ſo, and I am confident they will think their cenſures are undeſerved when they have can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly conſidered what I have ſaid.</p>
            <p>I am really at a loſs to conceive why my name ſhould, without ſufficient grounds, be ſo frequently mentioned in the public papers, and held in ſuch an odious point of view. It cannot ariſe from any doubts of my attachment to the general cauſe of America, my exertions from the firſt promulgation of the ſtamp act to this day do not leave room for a ſingle ſuſpicion, eſpecially as thoſe exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were greateſt when our affairs were at the worſt. It cannot juſtly ariſe from any part of my conduct as a private citizen; for near twenty years I was engaged in a very great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of buſineſs, and extended the commerce of this port to places little known to you before my time. This increaſed the demand for your produce, raiſed the value of your lands, encouraged your induſtry, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded your labours. I imported thouſands of good ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlers into Pennſylvania, after that buſineſs had ruined al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all that went before me in it.</p>
            <p>With pleaſure I can now look round me, and ſee amongſt my fellow citizens ſome whoſe fortunes I have made; many for whom I laid the foundation of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent importance; hundreds whoſe circumſtances I have bettered, and thouſands to whoſe maintenance I have contributed. Aſk thoſe that deal with me, whether I am generous, open, and deciſive in my dealing; aſk the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous tradeſmen I have employed and do employ, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I pay them punctually and chearfully; aſk that uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful body of men who follow the ſea, whether I have not been their conſtant friend and benefactor, whenever it was in my power; and aſk the honeſt labourer whether I have ever ſqueezed a pittance from his hard ſervice. It gives me pain to mention theſe things. It is not from a diſpoſition to boaſt my own praiſes, but a ſincere and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſire of poſſeſſing ſo much of your eſteem as I know myſelf to deſerve; and certainly the preſent committee ought not to conſider me as an enemy, for I have not only ſold my goods agreeable to their regulations, but have adviſed others to comply with them.</p>
            <p>My mercantile character cannot have given juſt cauſe for the attacks made on me, for I have conſtantly ſold off my cargoes as they arrived; and to conſider me as a depreciator of the Continental Money, and at the ſame time as the holder of very conſiderable ſums of it, is too abſurd to deſerve refutation.—However, I muſt add, that I have always paid too much reſpect to the credit of the paper money for my own intereſt. For by making pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſes of bills of exchange, lands, &amp;c. at prices that now would appear nothing, I might have amaſſed no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable fortune. Inſtead of doing theſe things, I have freely and liberally ſtaked my property in the export and import trade with various ſucceſs, frequently meeting with ſo many and ſuch heavy loſſes as would have deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a leſs reſolute trader from continuing the purſuit. The inſtances of my ſucceſs I need not mention, for theſe are counted up by lookers on in a ten-fold propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>This I know, that there are people who have made much more without riſquing a ſhilling, and by the few ſmall land purchaſes I have made, I have learnt that in that way alone I might have been a greater gainer, with infinitely leſs trouble and without any riſque.</p>
            <p>My enemies at <hi>preſent</hi> ſeem pretty numerous, and they are ſuch on improper motives; for I declare that I am not conſcious of having given any man juſt cauſe for being ſo.</p>
            <p>If the diſguſt of any part of my fellow citizens proceeds from my oppoſition to the preſent conſtitution of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, ſurely when they come to conſider, that a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of opinion on ſuch ſubjects is eſſential to a free go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and that to act in conformity with our opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons where the object is public good is the duty of a good man, they will pardon endeavours which were well meant, even if founded in error, and in their own zeal on the one ſide, find a reaſonable apology for mine on the other. For I will not ſuppoſe they have been actuated by private views, becauſe I feel nothing in my own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom to juſtify the ſuſpicion of others. My conduct in promoting meaſures for re-conſidering the conſtitution was by thoſe that oppoſed me acknowledged to be can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did, open and liberal; I never was guilty of perſonal abuſe, nor had I any perſonalities in view. I neither wanted or would accept any offer myſelf, nor had I any connections to provide for.</p>
            <p>My ſole object was to obtain ſuch a Conſtitution as would in my opinion anſwer the ends of good government; and it was to me a matter of indifference what men were in the ſeats of authority, if ſufficient ſecurity were provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the liberty, life and property of individuals. I am very deſirous of being only a private man, and when I became otherwiſe, it was in obedience to a ſentiment I had adopted, that in times of diſtreſs it was the duty of a good citizen to act in whatever ſtation his country might call him to, and ſo far am I from courting the continuance of public employment, that I ſhall with the greateſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure reſign that which I now hold to ſuch worthier hands as you, my fellow-citizens may appoint. While I was your ſervant it was my pride to ſerve you faithfully, to ſerve you chearfully; I have done ſo near four years, and made as great ſacrifices of private intereſt as any man among you. I made them with alacrity. I had and ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a proper ſenſe of the honour of ſacrificing my proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, my labour and my eaſe, to the voice of my country. In your applauſe I ſhall at all times feel myſelf over-paid, and if I miſs of that reward, I ſhall conſole myſelf with an approving conſcience; and I ſhall at all times be ready to give my tribute of praiſe to thoſe more fortunate men, who with greater abilities or better opportunities may have rendered you more eſſential or more agreeable ſervices.</p>
