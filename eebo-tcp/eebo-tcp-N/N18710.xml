            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>MATTHEW vii. 12.</bibl>
               <q>THEREFORE ALL THINGS WHATSOEVER YE WOULD THAT MEN SHOULD DO TO YOU, DO YE EVEN SO TO THEM; FOR THIS IS THE LAW, AND THE PROPHETS.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS precept of our divine Lord hath always been admired as moſt excellent; and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs with the greateſt reaſon. Yet it needs ſome explanation. It is not ſurely to be underſtood in the moſt unlimited ſenſe, implying that becauſe a prince expects and wiſhes for obedience from his ſubjects, he is obliged to obey them; that becauſe parents wiſh their children to ſubmit to their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, therefore they are to ſubmit to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of their children: or that becauſe ſome men wiſh that others would concur and aſſiſt them to the gratification of their unlawful deſires, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they alſo are to gratify the unlawful deſires <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> others, But whatever we are conſcious, that we ſhould, in an exchange of circumſtances, wiſh, and are perſuaded that we might reaſonably wiſh, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> others would do to us; that we are bound to do to them. This is the general rule given us in the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:024292_0004_0FC616488CBDFE50"/>
text; and a very extenſive rule it is, reaching to the whole of our conduct: and is particularly uſeful to direct our conduct toward inferiors, and thoſe whom we have in our power. I have therefore thought it a proper foundation for the diſcourſe which by <hi>The Society for the Promotion of Freedom, and for the Relief of Perſons unlawfully holden in Bondage,</hi> I have the honour to be appointed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver, on the preſent occaſion.</p>
            <p>This divine maxim is moſt properly applicable to the ſlave-trade, and to the ſlavery of the Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans. Let us then make the application.</p>
            <p>Should we be willing, that the Africans or any other nation ſhould purchaſe us, our wives and children, tranſport us into Africa, and there ſell us into perpetual and abſolute ſlavery? Should we be willing, that they by large bribes and offers of a gainful traffic ſhould entice our neighbours to kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nap and ſell us to them, and that they ſhould hold in perpetual and cruel bondage, not only ourſelves, but our poſterity through all generations? Yet why is it not as right for them to treat us in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as it is for us to treat them in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? Their colour indeed is different from our's. But does this give us a right to enſlave them? The nations, from Germany to Guinea, have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions of every ſhade, from the faireſt white to a jetty black: and if a black complexion ſubject a nation or an individual to ſlavery; where ſhall ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very begin? or where ſhall it end?</p>
            <p>I propoſe to mention a few reaſons againſt the right of the ſlave-trade—and then to conſider the principal arguments, which I have ever heard urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in favour of it.—What will be ſaid againſt the ſlave-trade will generally be equally applicable to ſlavery itſelf; and if concluſive againſt the former, will be equally concluſive againſt the latter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:024292_0005_0FC6164AA52D2E70"/>
As to the ſlave-trade, I conceive it to be unjuſt in itſelf—abominable, on account of the cruel man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which it is conducted—and totally wrong, on account of the impolicy of it, or its deſtructive ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to the moral and political intereſts of any country.</p>
            <p>I. It is unjuſt in itſelf.—It is unjuſt in the ſame ſenſe, and for the ſame reaſon, as it is to ſteal, to rob, or to murder. It is a principle, the truth of which hath in this country been generally if not univerſally acknowledged, ever ſince the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the late war, <hi>that all men are born equally free.</hi> If this be true, the Africans are by nature equally entitled to freedom as we are; and therefore we have no more right to enſlave, or to afford aid to enſlave them, than they have to do the ſame to us. They have the ſame right to their freedom, which they have to their property, or to their lives. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to enſlave them is as really and in the ſame ſenſe wrong, as to ſteal from them, to rob, or to murder them.</p>
            <p>There are indeed caſes, in which men may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be deprived of their liberty, and reduced to ſlavery; as there are caſes, in which they may be juſtly deprived of their lives. But they can juſtly be deprived of neither, unleſs they have by their own voluntary conduct forfeited it. Therefore ſtill the right to liberty ſtands on the ſame baſis with the right to life. And that the Africans have done ſomething, where by they have forfeited their liberty, muſt appear, before we can juſtly deprive them of it; as it muſt appear, that they have done ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, whereby they have forfeited their lives, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may juſtly deprive them of theſe.</p>
            <p>II. The ſlave-trade is wicked and abominable, on account of the cruel manner in which it is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:024292_0006_0FC6164C2B360300"/>
Beſide the ſtealing or kidnapping of men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and children, in the firſt inſtance, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation of others to this abominable practice; the inhuman manner in which they are tranſported to America, and in which they are treated on their paſſage and in their ſubſequent ſlavery, is ſuch as ought forever to deter every man from acting any part in this buſineſs, who has any regard to juſtice or humanity. They are crowded ſo cloſely into the holds and between the decks of veſſels, that they have ſcarcely room to lie down, and ſometimes not room to ſit up in an erect poſture; the men at the ſame time faſtened together with irons by two and two; and all this in the moſt ſultry climate. The conſequence of the whole is, that the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and fatal diſeaſes are ſoon bred among them, whereby vaſt numbers of thoſe exported from Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca periſh in the voyage: others in dread of tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſlavery which is before them, and in diſtreſs and deſpair, from the loſs of their parents, their children, their huſbands, their wives, all their dear connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and their dear native country itſelf, ſtarve themſelves to death, or plunge themſelves into the ocean. Thoſe who attempt in the former of thoſe ways to eſcape from their perſecutors, are tortured by live coals applied to their mouths. Thoſe who attempt an eſcape in the latter and fail, are equally tortured by the moſt cruel beating, or otherwiſe as their perſecutors pleaſe. If any of them make an attempt, as they ſometimes do, to recover their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, ſome, and as the circumſtances may be, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, are put to immediate death. Others beaten, bruiſed, cut and mangled, in a moſt inhuman and ſhocking manner, are in this ſituation exhibited to the reſt, to terrify them from the like attempt in future: and ſome are delivered up to every ſpecies of torment, whether by the application of the whip,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:024292_0007_0FC6164E5BCED1F8"/>
or of any other inſtrument, even of fire itſelf, as the ingenuity of the ſhip-maſter and of his crew is able to ſuggeſt, or their ſituation will admit; and theſe torments are purpoſely continued for ſeveral days, before death is permitted to afford relief to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe objects of vengeance.</p>
            <p>By this means, according to the common com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, twenty-five thouſand, which is a fourth part of thoſe who are exported from Africa, and by the conceſſion of all, twenty thouſand, annually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, before they arrive at the places of their deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in America.</p>
            <p>But this is by no means the end of the ſufferings of this unhappy people. Bred up in a country ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouſly yielding the neceſſaries and conveniences of ſavage life, they have never been accuſtomed to labour: of courſe, they are but ill prepared to go through the fatigue and drudgery to which they are doomed in their ſtate of ſlavery. Therefore partly by this cauſe, partly by the ſcantineſs and badneſs of their food, and partly from dejection of ſpirits, mortification and deſpair, another twenty-five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand die in the ſeaſoning, as it is called, <hi>i. e.</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two years of their arrival in America. This I ſay is the common computation. Or if we will in this particular be as favourable to the trade <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in the eſtimate of the number which periſhes on the paſſage, we may reckon the number which dies in the ſeaſoning to be twenty thouſand. So that of the hundred thouſand annually exported from Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca to America, fifty thouſand, as it is commonly computed, or on the moſt favourable eſtimate, forty thouſand, die before they are ſeaſoned to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
            <p>Nor is this all. The cruel ſufferings of theſe pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable beings are not yet at an end, Thence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:024292_0008_0FC6165BCA472250"/>
they have to drag out a miſerable life in abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute ſlavery, entirely at the diſpoſal of their maſters, by whom not only every venial fault, every mere inadvertence or miſtake, but even real virtues, are liable to be conſtrued into the moſt atrocious crimes, and puniſhed as ſuch, according to their caprice or rage, while they are intoxicated ſometimes with liquor, ſometimes with paſſion.</p>
            <p>By theſe maſters they are ſupplied with barely enough to keep them from ſtarving, as the whole expence laid out on a ſlave for food, clothing and medicine, is commonly computed on an average at thirty ſhillings ſterling annually. At the ſame time they are kept at hard labour from five o'clock in the morning, till nine at night, excepting time to eat twice during the day. And they are conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under the watchful eye of overſeers and Negro-drivers, more tyrannical and cruel than even their maſters themſelves. From theſe drivers, for every imagined as well as real neglect or want of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they receive the laſh, the ſmack of which is all day long in the ears of thoſe who are on the planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or in the vicinity; and it is uſed with ſuch dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity and ſeverity, as not only to lacerate the ſkin, but to tear out ſmall portions of the fleſh at almoſt every ſtroke.</p>
            <p>This is the general treatment of the ſlaves. But many individuals ſuffer ſtill more ſeverely. Many, many are knocked down; ſome have their eyes beaten out; ſome have an arm or a leg broken, or chopt off; and many, for a very ſmall or for no crime at all, have been beaten to death merely to gratify the fury of an enraged maſter or overſeer.</p>
            <p>Nor ought we on this occaſion to overlook the wars among the nations of Africa excited by the trade, or the deſtruction attendant on thoſe wars. Not to mention the deſtruction of property, the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:024292_0009_0FC6165CEDDA9A08"/>
burning of towns and villages, &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by reaſonable computation, that there are annually exported from Africa to the various parts of America, one hundred thouſand ſlaves, as was before obſerved; that of theſe ſix thouſand are cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of war; that in the wars in which theſe are taken, ten perſons of the victors and vanquiſhed are killed, to one taken; that therefore the taking of the ſix thouſand captives is attended with the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſixty thouſand of their countrymen. Now does not juſtice, does not humanity ſhrink from the idea, that in order to procure one ſlave to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy our avarice, we ſhould put to death ten human beings? Or that in order to increaſe our property, and that only in ſome ſmall degree, we ſhould carry on a trade, or even connive at it, to ſupport which ſixty thouſand of our own ſpecies are ſlain in war?</p>
            <p>Theſe ſixty thouſand, added to the forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand who periſh on the paſſage and in the ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, give us an hundred thouſand who are annually deſtroyed by the trade; and the whole advantage gained by this amazing deſtruction of human lives is ſixty thouſand ſlaves. For you will recollect, that the whole number exported from Africa in an hundred thouſand; that of theſe forty thouſand die on the paſſage and in the ſeaſoning, and ſixty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand are deſtroyed in the wars. Therefore while one hundred and ſixty thouſand are killed in the wars and are exported from Africa<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſixty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand are added to the ſtock of ſlaves.</p>

               </gap> when we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the miſeries which this unhappy people ſuffer in their wars, in their captivity, in their voyage to America, and during a wretched life of cruel ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and eſpecially when we conſider the annual deſtruction of an hundred thouſand lives in the manner before mentioned; who can heſitate to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare

this trade and the conſequent ſlavery to be contrary to every principle of juſtice and humanity, of the law of nature and of the law of God?</p>
            <p>III. This trade and this ſlavery are utterly wrong on the ground of impolicy. In a variety of reſpects they are exceedingly hurtful to the ſtate which to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerates them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They are hurtful, as they deprave the morals of the people.—The inceſſant and inhuman cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties practiſed in the trade, and in the ſubſequent ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, neceſſarily tend to harden the human heart againſt the tender feelings of humanity in the maſters of veſſels, in the ſailors, in the factors, in the propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etors of theſe ſlaves, in their children, in the overſeers, in the ſlaves themſelves, and in all who habitually ſee thoſe cruelties. Now the eradication or even the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of compaſſion, tenderneſs and humanity, is certainly a great depravation of heart, and muſt be followed with correſpondent depravity of manners. And meaſures which lead to ſuch depravity of heart and manners, cannot but be extremely hurtful to the ſtate, and conſequently are extremely impolitic.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The trade is impolitic, as it is ſo deſtructive of the lives of ſeamen. The ingenious Mr. Clark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hath in a very ſatisfactory manner made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that in the ſlave-trade alone Great-Britain loſes annually about nineteen hundred ſeamen; and that this loſs is more than double to the loſs annual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuſtained by Great-Britain in all her other trade taken together. And doubtleſs we loſe as many as Great-Britain in proportion to the number of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men whom we employ in this trade. Now can it be politic to carry on a trade which is ſo deſtructive of that uſeful part of our citizens, our ſeamen?</p>
            <p n="3">3. African ſlavery is exceedingly impolitic, as it diſcourages induſtry. Nothing is more eſſential to the political proſperity of any ſtate, than induſtry in
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:024292_0011_0FC6166125B60998"/>
the citizens. But in proportion as ſlaves are mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied, every kind of labour becomes ignominious: and in fact in thoſe of the United States, in which ſlaves are the moſt numerous, gentlemen and ladies of any faſhion diſdain to employ themſelves in bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, which in other ſtates is conſiſten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> with the dignity of the firſt families and firſt offices. In a country filled with Negro ſlaves, labour belongs to them only, and a white man is deſpiſed in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as he applies to it. Now how deſtructive to induſtry in all of the loweſt and middle claſs of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, ſuch a ſituation and the prevalence of ſuch ideas will be, you can eaſily conceive. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is, that ſome will nearly ſtarve, others will betake themſelves to the moſt diſhoneſt practices, to obtain the means of living.</p>
            <p>As ſlavery produces indolence in the white peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſo it produces all thoſe vices which are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally connected with it; ſuch as intemperance, lewdneſs and prodigality. Theſe vices enfeeble both the body and the mind, and unfit men for any vigorous exertions and employments either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal or mental. And thoſe who are unfit for ſuch exertions, are already a very degenerate race; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, not only in a moral, but a natural ſenſe. They are contemptible too, and will ſoon be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed even by their Negroes themſelves.</p>
            <p>Slavery tends to lewdneſs, not only as it produces indolence, but as it affords abundant opportunity for that wickedneſs, without either the danger and difficulty of an attack on the virtue of a woman of chaſtity, or the danger of a connection with one of ill fame. A planter with his hundred wenches about him is in ſome reſpects at leaſt like the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan in his ſeraglio, and we learn the too frequent influence and effect of ſuch a ſituation, not only from common fame, but from the multitude of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:024292_0012_0FC6166684D1CB90"/>
mulattoes in countries where ſlaves are very nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous.</p>
            <p>Slavery has a moſt direct tendency to haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs alſo, and a domineering ſpirit and conduct in the proprietors of the ſlaves, in their children, and in all who have the controul of them. A man who has been bred up in domineering over Negroes, can ſcarcely avoid contracting ſuch a habit of haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and domination, as will expreſs itſelf in his general treatment to mankind, whether in his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate capacity, or in any office, civil or military, with which he may be veſted. Deſpotiſm in economics naturally leads to deſpotiſm in politics, and domeſtic ſlavery in a free government is a perfect ſoliciſm in human affairs.</p>
            <p>How baneful all theſe tendencies and effects of ſlavery muſt be to the public good, and eſpecially to the public good of ſuch a free country as our's, I need not inform you.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In the ſame proportion as induſtry and labour are diſcouraged, is population diſcouraged and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented. This is another reſpect in which ſlavery is exceedingly impolitic. That population is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented in proportion as induſtry is diſcouraged, is, I conceive, ſo plain, that nothing needs to be ſaid to illuſtrate it. Mankind in general will enter into matrimony as ſoon as they poſſeſs the means of ſupporting a family. But the great body of any people have no other way of ſupporting themſelves or a family, than by their own labour. Of courſe as labour is diſcouraged, matrimony is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, and population is prevented.—But the impolicy of whatever produces theſe effects will be acknowledged by all. The wealth, ſtrength and glory of a ſtate depend on the number of its virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous citizens: and a ſtate without citizens is at leaſt as great an abſurdity, as a king without ſubjects.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:024292_0013_0FC61667DC141470"/>
5. The impolicy of ſlavery ſtill further appears from this, that it weakens the ſtate, and in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the degree in which it exiſts, expoſes it to become an eaſy conqueſt.—The increaſe of free ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens is an increaſe of the ſtrength of the ſtate. But not ſo with regard to the increaſe of ſlaves. They not only add nothing to the ſtrength of the ſtate, but actually diminiſh it in proportion to their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Every ſlave is naturally an enemy to the ſtate in which he is holden in ſlavery, and wants nothing but an opportunity to aſſiſt in its overthrow. And an enemy within a ſtate, is much more dangerous than one without it.</p>
            <p>Theſe obſervations, concerning the prevention of population and weakening the ſtate, are ſupported by facts, which have fallen within our own obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That the ſouthern ſtates, in which ſlaves are ſo numerous, are in no meaſure ſo populous, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the extent of territory, as the northern, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> a fact of univerſal notoriety<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that during the late war, the ſouthern ſtates found themſelves greatly weakened by their ſlaves, and therefore were ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over-run by the Britiſh army, is equally noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
            <p>From the view we have now taken of this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject we ſcruple not to infer, that to carry on the ſlave-trade, and to introduce ſlaves into our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, is not only to be guilty of injuſtice, robbery and cruelty, toward our follow-men; but it is to injure ourſelves and our country; and therefore it is altogether unjuſtifiable, wicked and abominable.</p>
            <p>Having thus conſidered the injuſtice and ruinous tendency of the ſlave-trade, I proceed to attend to the principal arguments urged in favour of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is ſaid, that the Africans are the poſterity of Ham, the ſon of Noah; that Canaan, one of Ham's ſons, was curſed by Noah<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be a ſervant
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:024292_0014_0FC6166A50BBF750"/>
of ſervants; that by Canaan we are to underſtand Ham's poſterity in general; that as his poſterity are devoted by God to ſlavery, we have a right to enſlave them.—This is the argument: to which I anſwer:</p>
            <p>It is indeed generally thought that Ham peopled Africa; but that the curſe on Canaan extended to all the poſterity of Ham is a mere imagination. The only reaſon given for it is, that Canaan was only one of Ham's ſons; and that it ſeems reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that the curſe of Ham's conduct ſhould fall on all his poſterity, if on any. But this argument is inſufficient. We might as clearly argue, that the judgments denounced on the houſe of David, on account of his ſin in the matter of Uriah, muſt equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall on all his poſterity. Yet we know, that many of them lived and died in great proſperity. So in every caſe in which judgments are predicted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning any nation or family.</p>
            <p>It is allowed in this argument, that the curſe was to fall on the <hi>poſterity</hi> of Ham, and not immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on Ham himſelf: if otherwiſe, it is nothing to the purpoſe of the ſlave-trade, or of any ſlaves now in exiſtence. It being allowed then, that this curſe was to fall on Ham's poſterity, he who had a right to curſe the whole of that poſterity, had the ſame right to curſe a part of it only, and the poſterity of Canaan equally as any other part; and a curſe on Ham's poſterity in the line of Canaan was as real a curſe on Ham himſelf, as a curſe on all his poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty would have been.</p>
            <p>Therefore we have no ground to believe, that this curſe reſpected any others, than the poſterity of Canaan, who lived in the land of Canaan, which is well known to be remote from Africa. We have a particular account, that all the ſons of Canaan ſettled in the land of Canaan; as may be ſeen in
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:024292_0015_0FC6166EC28C05F8"/>
Gen. x. 15—20. <q>And Canaan begat Sidon his firſt born, and Heth, and the Jebuſite, and the Emorite, and the Girgaſite, and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite, and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward were the families of the Canaanites ſpread abroad. And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou goeſt to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goeſt unto Sodom and Gomorrah, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah, and Zeboim, even unto Laſhah.</q>—Nor have we account that any of their poſterity except the Carthaginians afterward removed to any part of Africa: and none will pretend that theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled Africa in general; eſpecially conſidering, that they were ſubdued, deſtroyed, and ſo far extirpated by the Romans.</p>
            <p>This curſe then of the poſterity of Canaan, had no reference to the inhabitants of Guinea, or of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica in general; but was fulfilled partly in Joſhua's time, in the reduction and ſervitude of the Canaan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> eſpecially of the Gibeonites; partly by what the Phen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="5 letters">
                  <desc>•••••</desc>
               </gap>s ſuffered from the Chaldeans, Perſians and Gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>s; and finally by what the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians ſuffered from the Romans.</p>
            <p>Therefore this curſe gives us no right to enſlave the Africans, as we do by the ſlave-trade, becauſe it has no reſpect to the Africans whom we enſlave. Nor if it had reſpected them, would it have given any ſuch right; becauſe it was not an inſtitution of ſlavery, but a mere prophecy of it. And from this prophecy we have no more ground to infer the right of ſlavery, than we have from the prophecy of the deſtruction of Jeruſalem by Nebuchadnezzar, or by the Romans, to infer their right reſpectively to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it in the manner they did; or from other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies to infer the right of Judas to betray his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or the Jews to crucify him.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:024292_0016_0FC616715FD1B0E0"/>
2. The right of ſlavery is inferred from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Abraham, who had ſervants born in his houſe and bought with his money.—But it is by no means certain, that theſe were ſlaves as our Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes are. If they were, it is unaccountable, that he went out at the head of an army of them to fight his enemies. No Weſt-India planter would eaſily be induced to venture himſelf in ſuch a ſituation. It is far more probable, that ſimilar to ſome of the vaſſals under the feudal conſtitution, the ſervants of Abraham were only in a good meaſure dependent on him, and protected by him. But if they were to all intents and purpoſes ſlaves, Abraham's holding of them will no more prove the right of ſlavery, than his going in to Hagar, will prove it right for any man to cohabit with his wench.</p>
            <p n="3">3. From the divine permiſſion given the Iſraelites to buy ſervants of the nations round about them, it is argued, that we have a right to buy the Africans and hold them in ſlavery. See Lev. xxv. 44—47. <q>Both thy bondman and thy bondmaids, which thou ſhalt have, ſhall be of the heathen that are round about you: of them ſhall ye buy bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and bondmaids. Moreover, of the child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren of the ſtrangers that do ſojourn among you, of them ſhall ye buy, and of their families, that are with you, which they begat in your land; and they ſhall be your poſſeſſion. And ye ſhall take them as an inheritance for your children af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you, to inherit them for a poſſeſſion; they ſhall be your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Iſrael ye ſhall not rule one over another with rigour.</q> But if this be at all to the purpoſe, it is a permiſſion to every nation under heaven to buy ſlaves of the nations round about them; to us, to buy of our Indian neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; to them, to buy of us; so the French, to
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:024292_0017_0FC61673DC350DD8"/>
buy of the Engliſh, and to the Engliſh to buy of the French; and ſo through the world. If then this argument be valid, every man has an entire right to engage in this trade, and to buy and ſell any other man of another nation, and any other man of another nation has an entire right to buy and ſell him. Thus, according to this conſtruction, we have in Lev. xxv. 43, &amp;c. an inſtitution of an univerſal ſlave-trade, by which every man may not only become a merchant, but may rightfully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the merchandize itſelf of this trade, and may be bought and ſold like a beaſt.—Now this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence will be given up as abſurd, and therefore alſo the conſtruction of ſcripture, from which it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, muſt be given up. Yet it is preſumed, that there is no avoiding that conſtruction or the abſurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity flowing from it, but by admitting, that this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the Iſraelites to buy ſlaves has no reſpect to us, but was in the ſame manner peculiar to them, as the permiſſion, and command to ſubdue, deſtroy and extirpate the whole Canaanitiſh nation; and therefore no more gives countenance to African ſlavery, than the command to extirpate the Canaan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites, gives countenance to the extirpation of any nation in theſe days, by an univerſal ſlaughter of men and women, young men and maidens, infants and ſucklings.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is further pleaded, that there were ſlaves in the time of the apoſtles; that they did not forbid the holding of thoſe ſlaves, but gave directions to ſervants, doubtleſs referring to the ſervants of that day, to obey <hi>their maſters,</hi> and <hi>count them worthy of all honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this the anſwer is, that the apoſtles teach the general duty of ſervants who are righteouſly in the ſtate of ſervitude, as many are or may be, by hire, by indenture, and by judgment of a civil court.
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:024292_0018_0FC6167564A6EF40"/>
But they do not ſay, whether the ſervants in general of that day were juſtly holden in ſlavery or not. In like manner they lay down the general rules of obedience to civil magiſtrates, without deciding concerning the characters of the magiſtrates of the Roman empire in the reign of Nero. And as the apoſtle Paul requires maſters <hi>to give their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> that which is juſt and equal</hi> (Col. iv. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>) ſo if any were enſlaved unjuſtly, of courſe be in this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of the maſters of ſuch, to give them their freedom.—Thus the apoſtles great the ſlavery of that day in the ſame manner that they treat the civil government; and ſay nothing more in favour of the former, than they ſay in favour of the latter.</p>
            <p>Beſides, this argument from the ſlavery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the days of the apoſtles, if it prove any thing, proves too much, and ſo confutes itſelf. It proves, that we may enſlave all captives taken in war, of any nation, and in any the moſt unjuſt war, ſuch as the wars of the Romans, which were generally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken from the motives of ambition or avarice. On the ground of this argument we had a right to enſlave the priſoners, whom we, during the late war, took from the Britiſh army; and they had the ſame right to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; and ſo with reſpect to all other nations.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is ſtrongly urged, that the Negroes brought from Africa are all captives of war, and therefore are juſtly bought and holden in ſlavery.—This is a principal argument always urged by the advocates for ſlavery; and in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> debate on this ſubject, it hath been ſtrongly inſiſted on very lately, in the Britiſh parliament. Therefore it requires our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular attention.</p>
            <p>Captives in a war juſt on their part, cannot be juſtly enſlaved; nor is this pretended. Therefore the captives, who may be juſtly enſlaved, muſt be
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:024292_0019_0FC61676DF1A4F90"/>
taken in a war unjuſt on their part. But even on the ſuppoſition, that captives in ſuch a war may be juſtly enſlaved, it will not follow, that we can juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carry on the ſlave-trade, as it is commonly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on from the African coaſt. In this trade any ſlaves are purchaſed, who are offered for ſale, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther juſtly or unjuſtly enſlaved. No enquiry is made whether they were captives in any war; much leſs, whether they were captivated in a war unjuſt on their part.</p>
            <p>By the moſt authentic accounts, it appears, that the wars in general in Africa are excited by the proſpect of gain from the ſale of the captives of the war. Therefore thoſe taken by the aſſailants in ſuch wars, cannot be juſtly enſlaved. Beſide theſe, many are kidnapped by thoſe of neighbouring na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome by their own neighbours; and ſome by their kings or their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

They buy all that are offered, provided they like them and the price.—So that the plea, that the African ſlaves are captives in war, is entirely inſufficient to juſtify the ſlave-trade as now carried on.</p>

againſt another, by other means than the ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of its captives. If a nation be victorious in the war, it may exact ſome towns or a diſtrict of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, by way of caution; or it may impoſe a fine to deter from future injuries. If the nation be no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> victorious, it will do no good to enſlave the captives whom it has taken. It will provoke the victors and fooliſhly excite vengeance which cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled.</p>
            <p>Or if neither nation be decidedly victorious, to enſlave the captives on either ſide can anſwer no good purpoſe, but muſt at leaſt occaſion the enſlav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the citizens of the other nation, who are now or in future may be in a ſtate of captivity. Such a practice therefore neceſſarily tends to evil, and not good.</p>
            <p>Beſides; captives in war are generally common ſoldiers or common citizens; and they are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorant of the true cauſe or cauſes of the war, and are by their ſuperiors made to believe, that the war is entirely juſt on their part. Or if this be not the caſe, they may by force be compelled to ſerve in a war which they know to be unjuſt. In either of theſe caſes, they do not deſerve to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to perpetual ſlavery. To inflict perpetual ſlavery on theſe private ſoldiers and citizens is man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ifeſtly not to do as we would wiſh that men ſhould do to us. If we were taken in a war unjuſt on our part, we ſhould not think it right to be condemned to perpetual ſlavery. No more right is it for us to condemn and hold in perpetual ſlavery others, who are in the ſame ſituation.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It is argued, that as the Africans in their own country, previouſly to the purchaſe of them by the African traders, are captives in war; if they were not bought up by thoſe traders, they would be put to death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that therefore to purchaſe them, and to
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:024292_0021_0FC6167CE002C748"/>
ſubject them to ſlavery inſtead of death, is an act of mercy, not only lawful but meritorious.</p>
            <p>If the caſe were indeed ſo as is now repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, the purchaſe of the Negroes would be no more meritorious, than the act of a man, who if we were taken by the Algerines, ſhould purchaſe us out of that ſlavery. This would indeed be an act of benevolence, if the purchaſer ſhould ſet us at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. But it is no act of benevolence to buy a man out of one ſtate into another no better. Nay, the act of ranſoming a man from death, gives no right to the ranſome<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to commit a crime or an act of injuſtice to the perſon ranſomed. The perſon ranſomed is doubtleſs obligated according to his ability to ſatisfy the ranſomer for his expence and trouble. Yet the ranſomer has no more right to enſlave the other, than the man who ſaves the life of another, who was about to be killed by a robber or an aſſaſſin, has a right to enſlave him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—The li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of a man for life is a far greater good, than the property paid for a Negro on the African coaſt. And to deprive a man of an immenſely greater good, in order to recover one immenſely leſs, is an immenſe injury and crime.</p>
            <p n="7">7. As to the pretence, that to prohibit or lay aſide this trade, would be hurtful to our commerce; it is ſufficient to aſk; whether on the ſuppoſition, that it were advantageous to the commerce of Great-Britain to ſend her ſhips to theſe ſtates, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port us into perpetual ſlavery in the Weſt-Indies, it would be right that ſhe ſhould go into that trade.</p>
            <p n="8">8.

that if the ſkins and teeth of the Negroes were as valuable articles of commerce as furs and elephants' teeth, and a merchant were to lay out his property in this commerce, he ought by no means to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed therein.</p>
            <p n="9">9. But others will carry on the trade, if we do not.—So others will rob, ſteal and murder, if we do not.</p>
            <p n="10">10. It is ſaid, that ſome men are intended by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be ſlaves.—If this mean, that the author of nature has given ſome men a licence to enſlave others; this is denied, and proof is demanded. If it mean, that God hath made ſome of capacities in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to others, and that the laſt have a right to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave the firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this argument will prove, that ſome of the citizens of every country, have a right to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave other citizens of the ſame country; nay, that ſome have a right to enſlave their own brothers and ſiſters.—But if this argument mean, that God in his providence ſuffers ſome men to be enſlaved, and that this proves, that from the beginning he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they ſhould be enſlaved, and made them with this intention; the anſwer is, that in like manner he ſuffers ſome men to be murdered, and in this ſenſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he intended and made them to be murdered. Yet no man in his ſenſes will hence argue the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of murder.</p>

It is further pretended, that no other men, than Negroes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> can endure labour in the hot cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates of the Weſt-Indies, and the ſouthern ſtates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—But does this appear to be fact? In all other cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, the labouring people are the moſt healthy. And I confeſs I have not yet ſeen evidence, but that thoſe who have been accuſtomed to labour, and are inured to thoſe climates, can bear labour there alſo.—However, taking for granted the fact aſſerted in this objection, does it follow, that the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:024292_0023_0FC616821F9A35C0"/>
inhabitants of thoſe countries have a right to enſlave the Africans to labour for them? No more ſurely than from the circumſtance, that you are feeble and cannot labour, it follows, that you have a right to enſlave your robuſt neighbour. As in all other caſes, he feeble and thoſe who chooſe not to labour, and ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> with to have their lands cultivated, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to hire the robuſt to labour for them; ſo no reaſon can be given, why the inhabitants of not climates ſhould not either perform their own labour, of hire thoſe who can perform it, whether Negroes or others.</p>
            <p>If our traders went to the coaſt of Africa to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the inhabitants, or to rob them of their proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, all would own that ſuch murderous or practical practices are wicked and abominable. Now it is as really wicked to rob a man of his liberty, as to rob him of his life; and it is much more wicked, than to rob him of his property. All men agree to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn highway robbery. And the ſlave-trade is as much a greater wickedneſs than highway robbery, as liberty is more valuable than property. How ſtrange is it then, that in the ſame nation highway robbery ſhould be puniſhed with death, and the ſlave-trade be encouraged by national authority?</p>
            <p>We all dread political ſlavery, or ſubjection to the arbitrary power of a king, or of any man or men not deriving their authority from the people. Yet ſuch a ſtate is inconceivably preferable to the ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Negroes. Suppoſe that in the late war we had been ſubdued by Great-Britain; we ſhould have been taxed without our conſent. But theſe taxes would have amounted to but a ſmall part of our property. Whereas the Negroes are deprived of all their property; no part of their earnings is their own; the whole is their maſters.—In a conquered ſtate we ſhould have been at liberty to diſpoſe of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:024292_0024_0FC6168483351738"/>
and of our property, in moſt caſes, as we ſhould chooſe. We ſhould have been free to live in this or that town or place; in any part of the country, or to remove out of the country; to apply to this or that buſineſs; to labour or not; and excepting a ſufficiency for the taxes, to diſpoſe of the fruit of our labour to our own benefit, or that of our child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, or of any other perſon. But the unhappy. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes in ſlavery can do none of theſe, things. They muſt do what they are commanded, and as much as they are commanded, on pain of the laſh. They muſt live where they are placed, and muſt confine themſelves to that ſpot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on pain of death.</p>
            <p>So that Great-Britain in her late attempt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave America, committed a very ſmall crime in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, in compariſon with the crime of thoſe who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave the Africans.</p>
            <p>The arguments which have been urged againſt the ſlave-trade, are with little variation applicable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the holding of ſlaves. He who holds a ſlave, continues to deprive him of that liberty, which was taken from him on the coaſt of Africa. And if it were wrong to deprive him of it in the firſt inſtance, why not in the ſecond? If this be true, no man hath a better, right to retain his Negro in ſlavery, than he had to take him from his native African ſhores. And every man who cannot ſhow, that his Negro hath by his voluntary conduct forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his liberty, is obligated immediately to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numit him. Undoubtedly we ſhould think ſo, were we holden in the ſame ſlavery in which the Negroes are: and our text requires us to do to others, as we would that they ſhould do to us.</p>
            <p>To hold a ſlave, who has a right to his liberty, is not only a real crime, but a very great one. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good Chriſtians have wondered how Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he father of the faithful, could take Hagar to
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:024292_0025_0FC61686E6E3BBF8"/>
his bed; and how Sarah, celebrated as an holy woman, could conſent to this tranſaction: alſo, how David and Solomon could have ſo many wives and concubines, and yet be real ſaints. Let ſuch enquire how it is poſſible that our fathers, and men now alive, univerſally reputed pious, ſhould hold Negro ſlaves, and yet be the ſubjects of real piety? And whether to reduce a man, who hath the ſame right to liberty as any other man, to a ſtate of abſolute ſlavery, or to hold him in that ſtate, be not as great a crime as concubinage or fornication. I preſume it will not be denied, that to commit theft or robbery every day of a man's life, is as great a ſin as to commit fornication in one inſtance. But to ſteal a man, or to rob him of his liberty, is a greater ſin than to ſteal his property, or to take it by violence. And to hold a man in a ſtate of ſlavery, who has a right to his liberty, is to be every day guilty of robbing him of his liberty, or of man-ſtealing. The conſequence is inevitable, that other things being the ſame, to hold a Negro ſlave, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he have forfeited his liberty, is a greater ſin in the ſight of God than concubinage or fornication.</p>
            <p>Does this concluſion ſeem ſtrange to any of you? Let me entreat you to weigh it candidly, before you reject it. You will not deny, that liberty is more valuable than property: and that it is a greater ſin to deprive a man of his whole liberty during life, than to deprive him of his whole property; or that man-ſtealing is a greater crime than robbery. Nor will you deny, that to hold in ſlavery a man who was ſtolen, is ſubſtantially the ſame crime as to ſteal him. Theſe principles being undeniable, I leave it to yourſelves to draw the plain and neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. And if your conſciences ſhall, in ſpite of all oppoſition, tell you, that while you hold your Negroes in ſlavery, you do wrong, exceedingly
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:024292_0026_0FC616882D8D9348"/>
wrong; that you do not, as you would that men ſhould do to you; that you commit ſin in the ſight of God; that you daily violate the plain rights of mankind, and that in a higher degree, than if you committed theſe or robbery; let me beſeech you not to ſtifle this conviction, but attend to it and act accordingly; leſt you add to your former guilt, that of ſinning againſt the light of truth, and of your own conſciences.</p>
            <p>To convince yourſelves, that, your information being the ſame, to hold a Negro ſlave is a greater ſin than fornication, theft or robbery, you need on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bring the matter home to yourſelves. I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to appeal to your own conſciences, whether you would not judge it to be a greater ſin for a man to hold you or your child during life in ſuch ſlavery as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that of the Negroes, than for him to ſpend one night in a brother, or in one inſtance to ſteal or rob. Let conſcience ſpeak, and I will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to its deciſion.</p>
            <p>This queſtion ſeems to be clearly decided by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation. Exod. xxi. 16. <q>He that ſtealeth a man and ſelleth him or if he be found in his hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ſhall ſurely be put to death.</q> Thus death is, by the divine expreſs declaration, the puniſhment due to the crime of man-ſtealing. But death is not the puniſhment declared by God to be due to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, theft or robbery, in common caſes. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have the divine authority to aſſert, that man-ſtealing is a greater crime than fornication, theft or robbery. Now to hold in ſlavery a man who has a right to liberty, is ſubſtantially the ſame crime as to deprive him of his liberty. And to deprive of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and reduce to ſlavery, a man who has a right to liberty, is man-ſtealing For it is immaterial, whether he be taken and reduced to ſlavery clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinely, or by open violence. Therefore if the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:024292_0027_0FC6168CA059E7F8"/>
Negroes have a right to liberty; to hold them in ſlavery is manumitting, which we have ſeen is, by God himſelf, declared to be a greater crime than fornication, theft or robbery.</p>
            <p>Perhaps, though this truth be clearly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrable, both from reaſon and revelation, you ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dare receive it, becauſe it ſeems to bear hardly on the characters of our pious fathers, who held ſlaves But they did it ignorantly, and in unbelief of the truth; as Abraham; Jacob, David and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, were ignorant that polygamy or concubin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age was wrong. As to domeſtic ſlavery, our fathers lived in a <hi>time of ignorance, which God winked at but now be commandeth all men every where to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent</hi> of this wickedneſs, and <hi>to break off this ſin by righteouſneſs, and this iniquity by ſhewing mercy to the poor, if it may be a lengthening out of their tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity.</hi> You therefore to whom the preſent blaze of light as to this ſubject has reached, cannot ſin at ſo cheap a rate as our fathers.</p>
            <p>But methinks I hear ſome ſay, I have bought my Negro. I have paid a large ſum for him; I cannot loſe this ſum, and therefore I cannot manumit him.—Alas! this is <hi>bitting the nail on the head.</hi> This brings into view the true cauſe which makes it ſo difficult to convince men of what is right in this caſe.—You recollect the ſtory of Amaziah's hiring an hundred thouſand men of Iſrael; for an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred talents, to aſſiſt him againſt the Edomites<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that when by the word of the Lord, he was forbidden to take thoſe hired men with him to the war, he cried out, <q>But what ſhall we do for the hundred talents, which I have given to the army of Iſrael?</q> In this caſe, the anſwer of God was <q>The Lord is able to give thee much more than this.</q>—To apply this to the ſubject before us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God is able to give thee much more than thou ſhalt loſe by man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ant manner, is ſtill a robber; and murder may be effected in a manner the leaſt cruel and tormenting; ſtill it is murder.</p>
            <p>Having now taken that view of our ſubject which was propoſed, we may in reflection ſee abundant reaſon to acquieſce in the inſtitution of this ſociety. If the ſlave-trade be unjuſt, and as groſs a violation of the rights of mankind, as would be, if the Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans ſhould tranſport us into perpetual ſlavery in Africa; to unite our influence againſt it, is a duty which we owe to mankind, to ourſelves, and to God too. It is but doing as we would that men ſhould do to us.—Nor is it enough that we have formed the ſociety; we muſt do the duties of it. The firſt of theſe is to put an end to the ſlave-trade. The ſecond is to relieve thoſe who, contrary to the laws of the country, are holden in bondage. Another is to defend thoſe in their remaining legal and natural rights, who are by law holden in bondage. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and not the leaſt important object of this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, I conceive to be, to increaſe and diſperſe the light of truth with reſpect to the ſubject of African ſlavery, and ſo prepare the way for its total aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For until men in general are convinced of the injuſtice of the trade, and of the ſlavery itſelf, comparatively little can be done to effect the moſt important purpoſes of the inſtitution.</p>
            <p>It is not to be doubted, that the trade is even now carried on from this ſtate. Veſſels are from time to time fitted out for the coaſt of Africa, to tranſport the Negroes to the Weſt-Indies and other parts. Nor will an end be put to this trade, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:024292_0029_0FC61694CC7164F0"/>
out vigilance and ſtrenuous exertion on the part of this ſociety; or other friends of humanity; nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a patient enduring of the oppoſition and odium of all who are concerned in it, of their friends, and of all who are of the opinion that it is juſtifiable. Among theſe we are doubtleſs to reckon ſome of large property, and conſiderable influence. And if the laws and cuſtoms of the country equally allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of it, many, and perhaps as many as now plead for the right of the African ſlave-trade, would plead for the right of kidnapping us, the citizens of the United States, and of ſelling us into perpetual ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.—If then we dare not occur the diſpleaſure of ſuch men, we may as well diſſolve the ſociety, and leave the ſlave-trade to be carried on, and the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes to be kidnapped; and though free in this ſtate, to be ſold into perpetual ſlavery in diſtant parts, at the pleaſure of any man, who wiſhes to make gain by ſuch abominable practices.</p>
            <p>Though we muſt expect oppoſition, yet if we be ſteady and perſevering, we need not fear that we ſhall fail of ſucceſs. The advantages, which the cauſe has already gained, are many and great. Thirty years ago ſcarcely a man in this country thought either the ſlave-trade or the ſlavery of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes to be wrong. But now how many and able advocates in private life, in our legiſlatures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, have appeared, and have openly and irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gably pleaded the rights of humanity in this as well as other inſtances? Nay, the great body of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, from New-Hampſhire to Virginia incluſively, have obtained ſuch light, that in all thoſe ſtates the further importation of ſlaves is prohibited by law. And in Maſſachuſetts and New-Hampſhire, ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is totally aboliſhed.</p>
            <p>Nor is the light concerning this ſubject confined to America. It hath appeared with great clearneſs
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:024292_0030_0FC61695ECEB67A8"/>

It flaſhes with ſplendour in the writings of Clarkſon, and in the proceedings of ſeveral ſocieties formed to aboliſh the ſlave-trade<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nor hath it been poſſible to ſhut it out of the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh parliament. This light is ſtill increaſing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in time will effect a total revolution.

But it is our duty to remove the obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which intercept the rays of this light, that it may reach not only public bodies, but every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual. And when it ſhall have obtained a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſpread, ſhall have diſpelled all darkneſs, and ſlavery ſhall be no more, it will be an honour to be recorded in hiſtory as a ſociety which was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and which exerted itſelf with vigou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <head>APPENDIX.</head>
            <p>SOME objections to the doctrine of the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſermon have been mentioned to the author, ſince the delivery of it. Of theſe it may be proper to take ſome notice.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The ſlaves are in a better ſituation than that in which they were in their own country; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they have opportunity to know the Chriſtian religion, and to ſecure the ſaving bleſſings of it. Therefore it is not an injury, but a benefit, to bring them into this country, even though their importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be accompanied and followed with ſlavery. It is alſo ſaid, that the ſituation of many Negroes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their maſters is much better than it would be were they free in this country; that they are much better fed and clothed, and are much more happy; that therefore to hold them in ſlavery is ſo far from a crime, that it is a meritorious act.</p>
            <p>With regard to theſe pleas, it is to be obſerved, that every man hath a right to judge concerning his own happineſs, and to chooſe the means of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining or promoting it; and to deprive him of this right is the very injury of which we complain; it is to enſlave him. Becauſe we judge, that the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes are more happy in this country, in a ſtate of ſlavery, than in the enjoyment of liberty in Africa, we have no more right to enſlave them and bring them into this country, than we have to enſlave any of our neighbours, who we judge would be more happy under our controul, than they are at preſent under their own. Let us make the caſe our own. Should we believe that we were juſtly treated, if the Africans ſhould carry us into perpetual ſlavery
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:024292_0032_0FC6169EB3D7AEC8"/>
in Africa, on the ground that they judged that we ſhould be more happy in that ſtate, than in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſituation?</p>
            <p>As to the opportunity which the Negroes in this country are ſaid to have, to become acquainted with Chriſtianity; this with reſpect to many is granted: but what follows from it? It would be ridiculous to pretend that this is the motive on which they act who import them, or they who buy and hold them in ſlavery. Or if this were the motive, it would not ſanctify either the trade or the ſlavery. We are not at liberty to do evil, that good may come; to commit a crime more aggravated than theft or robbery, that we may make a proſelyte to Chriſtianity. Neither our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, nor any one of his apoſtles, has taught us this mode of propagating the faith.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is ſaid, that the doctrine of the preceding ſermon imputes that as a crime to individuals, which is owing to the ſtate of ſociety. This is granted; and what follows? It is owing to the ſtate of ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, that our neighbours the Indians roaſt their captives: and does it hence follow, that ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct is not to be imputed to the individual agents as a crime? It is owing to the ſtate of ſociety in Popiſh countries, that thouſands worſhip the beaſt and his image: and is that worſhip therefore not to be imputed as a crime to thoſe who render it? Read the Revelation of St. John. The ſtate of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety is ſuch, that drunkenneſs and adultery are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry common in ſome countries; but will it follow, that thoſe vices are innocent in thoſe countries?</p>
            <p n="3">3. If I be ever ſo willing to manumit my ſlave, I cannot do it without being holden to maintain him, when he ſhall be ſick, or ſhall be old and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit. Therefore I have a right to hold him as a ſlave.—The ſame argument will prove, that you
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:024292_0033_0FC616A0DE9C8858"/>
have a right to enſlave your children or your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; as you are equally holden to maintain them in ſickneſs and in decrepit old age.—The argument implies, that in order to ſecure the money, which you are afraid the laws of your country will ſome time or other oblige you to pay; it is right for you to rob a free man of his liberty, or be guilty of man-ſtealing. On the ground of this argument, every town or pariſh obligated by law to maintain its helpleſs poor, has a right to ſell into perpetual ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry all the people who may probably or even poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly occaſion a public expence.</p>
            <p n="4">4. After all, it is not ſafe to manumit the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes: they would cut our throats; they would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the peace and government of the ſtate. Or at leaſt they would be ſo idle, that they would not provide themſelves with neceſſaries; of courſe, they muſt live by thievery and plundering.</p>
            <p>This objection requires a different anſwer, as it reſpects the northern, and as it reſpects the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern ſtates. As it reſpects the northern, in which ſlaves are ſo few, there is not the leaſt foundation to imagine, that they would combine or make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection againſt the government; or that they would attempt to murder their maſters. They are much more likely to kill their maſters, in order to obtain their liberty, or to revenge the abuſe they receive, while it is ſtill continued, than to do it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the abuſe hath ceaſed, and they are reſtored to their liberty. In this caſe, they would from a ſenſe of gratitude, or at leaſt from a conviction of the juſtice of their maſters, feel a ſtrong attachment, inſtead of a murderous diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>Nor is there the leaſt danger, but that by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vigilance of the ſelect-men, and by a ſtrict exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the laws now exiſting, the Negroes might in a tolerable degree be kept from idleneſs and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:024292_0034_0FC616A25EA5CF58"/>
All this hath been verified by experiment. In Maſſachuſetts, all the Negroes in the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth were by their new conſtitution liberated in a day: and none of the ill conſequences objected fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed either to the commonwealth or to individuals.</p>
            <p>With regard to the ſouthern ſtates, the caſe is different. The Negroes in ſome parts of thoſe ſtates are a great majority of the whole, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the evils objected would, in caſe of a general manumiſſion at once, be more likely to take place. But in the firſt place there is no proſpect that the Conviction of the truth, exhibited in the preceding diſcourſe, will at once take place in the minds of all the holders of ſlaves. The utmoſt that can be expected, is that it will take place gradually in one after another, and that of courſe the ſlaves will be gradually manumitted. Therefore the evils of a general manumiſſion at once, are dreaded without reaſon.</p>
            <p>If in any ſtate the ſlaves ſhould be manumitted in conſiderable numbers at once, or ſo that the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of free Negroes ſhould become large; various meaſures might be concerted to prevent the evils feared. One I beg leave to propoſe: that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers of the free Negroes be appointed from among themſelves, who ſhall be empowered to inſpect the morals and management of the reſt, and report to proper authority thoſe who are vicious, idle or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of managing their own affairs; and that ſuch authority diſpoſe of them under proper maſters for a year or other term, as is done perhaps in all the ſtates, with regard to the poor white people in like manner vicious, idle, or incapable of management. Such black overſeers would naturally be ambitious to diſcharge the duties of their office; they would in many reſpects have much more influence than white men with their countrymen: and other Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:024292_0035_0FC616A4EB3CDCE8"/>
looking forward to the ſame honourable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, would endeavour to deſerve it by their improvement and good conduct.</p>
            <p>But, after all, this whole objection, if it were ever ſo entirely founded on truth—if the freed Negroes would probably riſe againſt their maſters, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine againſt government, reſts on the ſame ground as the apology of the robber, who murders the man whom he has robbed. Says the robber to himſelf, I have robbed this man, and now if I let him go he will kill me, or he will complain to authority, and I ſhall be apprehended and hung. I muſt therefore kill him. There is no other way of ſafety for me.—The coincidence between this reaſoning and that of the objection under conſideration, muſt be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to all. And if this reaſoning of the robber be inconcluſive; if the robber have no right on that ground to kill the man whom he hath robbed; neither have the ſlave-holders any more right to continue to hold their ſlaves. If the robber ought to ſpare the life of the man robbed, take his own chance, and eſteem himſelf happy, if he can eſcape juſtice; ſo the ſlave-holders ought immediately to let their ſlaves go free, treat them with the utmoſt kindneſs, by ſuch treatment endeavour to pacify them with reſpect to paſt injuries, and eſteem them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves happy, if they can compromiſe the matter in this manner.</p>
            <p>In all countries, in which the ſlaves are a majority of the inhabitants, the maſters lie in a great meaſure at the mercy of the ſlaves, and may moſt rationally expect ſooner or later to be cut off, or driven out by the ſlaves, or to be reduced to the ſame level, and to be mingled with them into one common maſs. This I think is, by ancient and modern events, demonſtrated to be the natural and neceſſary courſe of human affairs. The hewers of wood and
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:024292_0036_0FC616A8FAA98848"/>
drawers of water among the Iſraelites, the Helots among the Lacedemonians, the ſlaves among the Romans, the villains and vaſſals in moſt of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of Europe under the feudal ſyſtem, have long ſince mixed with the common maſs of the people, and ſhared the common privileges and honours of their reſpective countries. And in the French Weſt-Indies the Mulattoes and free Negroes are already become ſo numerous and powerful a body, as to be allowed by the National Aſſembly to enjoy the common rights and honours of free men. Theſe facts plainly ſhow, what the whites in the Weſt-Indies and the ſouthern ſtates are to expect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their poſterity, that it will infallibly be a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ngrel breed, or elſe they muſt quit the country to the Negroes whom they have hitherto holden in bondage.</p>
            <p>Thus it ſeems, that they will be neceſſitated by Providence to make in one way or another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation to the Negroes for the injury which they have done them. In the firſt caſe, by taking them into affinity with themſelves, giving them their own ſons and daughters in marriage, and making them and their poſterity the heirs of all their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty and all their honours, and by raiſing their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to a partial whiteneſs, whereby a part at leaſt of that mark which brings on them ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt will be wiped off. In the other caſe, by leaving to them all their real eſtates. It is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, by the bare ſtating of the two caſes, that the compenſation in the latter caſe is by much the leaſt. In the former caſe, the compenſation will include all that is included in the latter, and much more. If therefore our ſouthern brethren, and the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Weſt-Indies, would balance their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts with their Negro ſlaves at the cheapeſt poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rate, they will doubtleſs judge it prudent, to
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:024292_0037_0FC616A9DCFEBAC0"/>
leave the country, with all their houſes, lands and improvements, to their quiet poſſeſſion and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; as otherwiſe Providence will compel them to much dearer ſettlement, and one attended with a circumſtance inconceivably more mortifying than the loſs of all their real eſtates, I mean the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their blood with that of the Negroes into one common poſterity.</p>
            <p>At <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>aſt it is to be hoped, that theſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will induce them to forbear any further im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of ſlaves, as the more numerous the ſlaves are, the more dangerous they will be, and the more deeply tinged will be the colour of their mulatto poſterity.</p>
            <p>It is not to be doubted, but that the Negroes in theſe northern ſtates alſo will, in time, mix with the common maſs of the people. But we have this conſolation, that as they are ſo ſmall a proportion of the inhabitants, when mixed with the reſt, they will not produce any very ſenſible diverſity of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>

            <head>A ſhort Sketch of the Evidence for the Abolition of the SLAVE-TRADE, delivered before a Committee of the Britiſh Houſe of Commons.</head>
            <p>VIRTUE, ſay moraliſts, is ſo tranſcendently beautiful, that ſhe need but be <hi>ſeen,</hi> to be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally admired: and is not VICE ſo hateful, that the more its features are <hi>viewed,</hi> the more it will be avoided? The traffic in the human ſpecies, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly as carried on by the Europeans on the coaſt of Africa, has ſo horrible an aſpect, than nothing, one ſhould think, but the MASK, under which it has been concealed, could have prevented all the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilized nations in the world uniting to drive the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted monſter from the face of, the earth. This MASK is, however, at length taken away, and the traffic ſtands expoſed in all its real, unalterable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity. The PEOPLE are now called upon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, to feel, and judge for themſelves. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations of former writers on this ſubject were roundly denied; the facts they ſtated were not only contradicted, but deemed impoſſible, and the authors themſelves were accuſed of ſlander. Now we have a body of EVIDENCE to which to appeal; of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, poſſeſſing every eſſential of <hi>credibility.</hi> The witneſſes have declared before the Select Committee of the Houſe of Commons, what they themſelves ſaw: they had the beſt opportunities of obſervation, and they are diſintereſted. And now it appears, that one half of the tale of human miſery hath not been told; and that every principle, than can bind a man

Hard indeed muſt thoſe hearts be, and inacceſſible thoſe underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings<note n="†" place="bottom">Fox's ditto.</note>, which ſuch evidence cannot reach!</p>
            <p>The evidence delivered before the Select Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of the Houſe of Commons is very voluminous, occupying two thouſand pages in folio. But a judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Abſtract and Arrangement of the Evidence, on the Part of the Petitioners for the Abolition of the Slave-Trade<note n="‡" place="bottom">Printed by J.

            <p>In the preface to this important volume of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence we read of rewards offered for taking run-away Negroes <hi>alive or dead</hi>—of laws being required to be made to prevent the practice of <hi>cutting off ears, noſes and tongues—</hi> of <hi>breaking limbs</hi> and <hi>putting one eyes</hi>—to prevent <hi>diſtempered, maimed, and worn out Negroes</hi> from infeſting towns—to prevent <hi>aged</hi> and <hi>infirm</hi> Negroes being driven from the plantations <hi>to ſtarve.</hi> We meet alſo with ſuch kind of preambles to acts as the following, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </p>
            <p>'Whereas the extreme cruelty and inhumanity of the managers, overſeers, and book-keepers of eſtates, have frequently driven ſlaves into the woods, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned rebellions, internal insurrections, &amp;c. And whereas alſo it frequently happens, that ſlaves come to their deaths by haſty and ſevere blows, and other improper treatment of overſeers and book-keepers, in the heat of paſſion; and when ſuch accidents do happen, the victims are entered in the plantation-books as having died of convulſions, fits, or other cauſes not to be accounted for: and to conceal the
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:024292_0040_0FC616B645D19020"/>
real truth of the cauſe of the death of ſuch ſlave or ſlaves, he or they is or are immediately put under ground,' &amp;c. Other preambles of a ſimilar complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, reſpecting the lodging, food and clothes of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes, are here to be met with. We alſo find that run-away negroes, when advertiſed, are deſcribed by the various brands upon their ſhoulders, breaſts, cheeks, and foreheads. A woman is deſcribed with a wooden leg; a man as having both his ears cropt, and another by his noſe and ears being cut off. Cornwall Chronicle, Nov 7, 1789. Other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances occur within the year 1791.</p>
            <p>The FIRST CHAPTER contains an account of the enormities committed by the natives of Africa on the perſons of one another, to procure ſlaves for the Europeans, proved by the teſtimony of ſuch as have viſited that continent—and confirmed by accounts from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> themſelves, after their arrival in the Weſt-Indies.</p>
            <p>Under this head, we learn that kidnapping, or, as the natives call it, panyaring, is very common; that war is made on purpoſe to procure ſlaves. The king's ſoldiers ſet fire to villages in the night, and ſeize the wretched inhabitants as they attempt to eſcape from the flames, and many periſh either by the fire or ſword in the execution of this horrid pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. A boy, who was carried away in the night from his father's houſe, ſays, he believes both his parents were killed; he is ſure that one was; and that many others were killed, and ſome taken. Various inſtances are mentioned of conſummate treachery em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in making captives. Kidnapping is profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally followed; large parties go up the country three hundred miles, to drive down captives—they go a wood-ranging, and pick up every one they meet, and ſtrip them naked. The purchaſers generally ſay, they do not care how the ſellers come by their
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:024292_0041_0FC616B7707267A0"/>
ſlaves. Many are ſold for crimes falſely imputed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Judges participate the profits of the fale, and are therefore ſtrongly induced to condemn the innocent. Crimes are invented and multiplied for the purpoſe of traffic. The great men dreſs up and employ women, to entice young men to be connected with them, that they may be convicted of adultery, and ſold. The ſlaves are ſeparated without the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to ties of conſanguinity, or the pathetic expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulations and remonſtrances of nature. When ſlave-ſhips are on the coaſt, the natives go armed, but are no where ſafe. The man, invited to drink with his neighbour, on riſing to go, is ſeized by two of them, and a large dog: and this mode of ſeizure is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</p>
            <p>By the SECOND CHAPTER it appears that the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans, by means of the trade in ſlaves, are the occaſion of the before mentioned enormities; that they ſometimes uſe additional means to excite the natives to practiſe them, often attempt themſelves to ſteal the natives, and ſucceed, force trade as they pleaſe, and are guilty of injuſtice in their dealings. In proof of this charge, we learn from the evidence, that Africans receive European goods in exchange for ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aves—that they declare when ſhips ceaſe to come (as in times of war) ſlaves ceaſe to be taken. African dealers make the Princes drunk, in order to overcome their averſion to unprovoked war: they furniſh the natives with arms and ammunition, and excite <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>The term war, in Africa, is uſed in general to ſignify pillage; and when many towns are ſeen blaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the night, the natives ſay war is carrying on.</p>
            <p>The traders advance goods to Chiefs, to induce them to ſeize their ſubjects or neighbours. Capt. Patterſon ſet two villages at variance, and brought priſoners from both ſides. It is not uncommon to

Dr. Trotter has ſeen the ſlaves drawing their breath with all thoſe laborious and anxious efforts for life, which are obſerved in expiring animals, ſubjected by experiment to foul air, or in the exhauſted receiver of an air pump: they cry out—'we are dying, and many are irrecoverably loſt by ſuffocation, having had no previous ſigns of indiſpoſition. They are cloſely wedged together, and have not ſo much room as a man in his coffin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> either in length or breadth. They ſometimes go <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>own well at night, and are found dead in the morning. Alexander Falconbridge was never among them for ten minutes together below, but his ſhirt was as wet as if dipped in water. Sometimes the dead and living are found ſhackled together. They lie on the bare planks, and the prominent parts of their bones, about the ſhoulder-blade and knees, have frequently been ſeen bare. No ſituation can be conceived ſo dreadful and diſguſting as that of ſlaves when ill of the flux. In the Alexander (A. Falconbridge ſays) the deck was covered with blood and mucus, and reſembled, a ſlaughter-houſe; the ſtench and foul air were intolerable. The ſlaves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhackled together, frequently quarrel and make a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance. Some refuſe food and medicine, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare they want to die. In ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>es compulſion is uſed. The ſhips are ſo fitted up as to prevent, by net-work, the ſlaves jumping overboard; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which they often attempt it, and ſometimes ſucceed, ſhewing ſigns of exultation in the very jaws of death. Some employ other means to deſtroy themſelves, and others <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

When ſeverely chaſtiſed for not taking their food, they have looked up with a ſmile and ſaid, "preſently we ſhall be no more." The thumb-ſcrew
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:024292_0045_0FC616C512A00D18"/>
is an inſtrument of torture; the application of it ſometimes occaſions mortifications, of which the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes die. An inſtance occurs of the cruelty of a Captain to an infant only nine months old, which one would ſuppoſe too ſhocking to be true, were it not corroborated by other ſpecimens of as great cruelty in various parts of the evidence. After a ſeries of tortures the infant-expired, and its ſavage murderer, not yet ſatisfied, would ſuffer none of the people on deck to throw the body overboard, but called the mother, the wretched mother, to perform this laſt ſad office to her murdered child. Unwilling, as it might naturally be ſuppoſed ſhe was, to comply, "he beat her," regardleſs of the indignant murmurs of her fettered countrymen, whom in the barbarous ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude of ſecure tyranny he permitted to be ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of this horrible ſcene—"he beat her, until he made her take up the child, and carry it to the ſide of the veſſel, and then ſhe dropped it into the ſea, turning her head another way, that ſhe might not ſee it<note n="*" place="bottom">Speech by W. Smith in the Houſe of Commons.</note>!" Another inſtance occurs in this chapter, not perhaps of more cruelty, though of greater magnitude.</p>
            <p>A ſhip from Africa, with about four hundred ſlaves on board, ſtruck upon ſome ſhoals, called the Morant Keys, diſtant eleven leagues S. S. E. off the eaſt end of a Jamaica. The officers and ſeamen of the ſhip landed in their, boats, carrying with them arms and proviſions. The ſlaves were left on board in their irons and ſhackles. This happened in the night time. When morning came, it was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered that the Negroes had got out of their irons, and were buſy making rafts, upon which they placed the women and children; the men who were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſwimming attended upon the rafts, whilſt they drifted before the wind towards the iſland where the ſeamen had landed. From an apprehenſion that
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:024292_0046_0FC616C81DE3A068"/>
the Negroes would conſume the water and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which the ſeamen had landed, they came to the reſolution of deſtroying them, by means of their fire arms and other weapons. As the poor wretches approached the ſhore, they actually deſtroyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween three and four hundred of them. Out of the whole cargo only thirty-three or thirty-four were ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and brought to Kingſton, where they wore ſold at public vendue.</p>
            <p>When the ſhips arrive at their deſtined ports, the cargo of ſlaves is ſold, either by ſcramble of vendue. The ſale by ſcramble is deſcribed.—A great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of people come on board with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders which carry off the ſlaves in ſuch numbers are aſcribed by Falconbridge to a diſeaſed mind, ſudden tranſitions from heat to cold, a putrid at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere, wallowing in their own excrements, and being ſhackled together.</p>
            <p>The Captains, ſurgeons, &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who have quitted the African ſlave-trade, uniformly declare the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to have been, that they could not conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly continue in it they ſay, that it is an unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, iniquitous, and villainous trade, founded on injuſtice and treachery; manifeſtly carried on by oppreſſion and cruelty, and not unfrequently ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating in murder. Captain Hall ſays, he quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it (in oppoſition to lucrative offers) from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction that it was perfectly illegal, and founded in blood.</p>
            <p>The FOURTH CHAPTER gives an account of the general eſtimation and treatment of the ſlaves in the Weſt-Indies. Dr. Jackſon ſays, that the Negroes are generally eſteemed a ſpecies of inferior beings, where the right of purchaſe gives the owner a power of uſing at his will.

            <p>Slaves are either field-ſlaves, or in or out door ſlaves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="unknown:024292_0048_0FC616CBA5B077D0"/>
The field-ſlaves begin their work at break of day. They work in rows, without exception, under the whip of drivers, and the weak are made to keep up with the ſtrong. They continue their labour (with two intermiſſions, half an hour during the morning, and two hours at noon) till ſun-ſet. In the Intervals they are made to pick graſs for the cattle. Cook has known pregnant women worked and flogged a few days before their delivery. Some, however, are a little indulged when in that ſtate. After the month they work with the children on their backs. In the crop-ſeaſon the labour is of much longer duration<note n="*" place="bottom">On ſome eſtates it is uſual to dig a hole in the ground, in which they put the bellies of pregnant women, while they whip them, that they may not eſcape puniſhment, nor yet endanger the life of the woman or child.</note>. The ſlaves ſometimes work ſo long that they cannot help ſleeping, and then it not unfrequently happens, that their arms are caught in the mill and torn off. They are ſaid to be allowed one day in ſeven for reſt, but this time is neceſſarily employed in raiſing food for the other days, and gathering graſs for their maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters cattle. The beſt allowance of food is at Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos, which is a pint of grain for twenty-four hours, and half a rotten herring, when to be had. When the herrings are unfit for the whites, they are bought up by planters for the ſlaves. Some allow nine pints of corn a week, and about one pound of ſalt fiſh, which is the greateſt allowance mentioned in the whole courſe of the evidence. Some have no proviſion but what they raiſe themſelves, and they are frequently ſo fatigued by the labour of the reſt of the week, as ſcarcely to be able to work for their own ſupport on the Sunday. And the land allotted them for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is often at the diſtance of three miles from their houſes; it would, however, be quite ample for their ſupport, were they allowed time ſufficient for its cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation.
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:024292_0049_0FC616CD2C77BA60"/>
Sometimes when they have been at the pains of clearing their land, their maſters take it for canes, and give them wood-land inſtead of it. This hardſhip ſome have ſo taken to heart as to die. Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid carcaſes are burnt; if they were buried, the ſlaves would dig them up and eat them, which would breed diſtempers among them. They are ſometimes driven by extreme hunger to ſteal, at the hazard of their lives. They are badly clothed; one half of them go almoſt naked. The ſlaves in general have no bed or b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dding at all. Their houſes are built with four poles, and that<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>. They have little or no property. All the evidence (to whom the queſtion has been propoſed) agree in anſwering, that they never knew or heard of a field-ſlave ever amaſſing ſuch a ſum, as enabled him to purchaſe his own freedom. The artificers, ſuch as houſe-carpenters, coopers, maſons, the drivers and head-ſlaves, are better off. The own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of women let them out for proſtitution, and flog them, if they do not bring home full wages.</p>
            <p>The Negroes, when whipped, are ſuſpended by the arms, with weights at their feet. They are firſt whipped with a whip made of cow-ſkin (which cuts, out the fleſh, whereas the military whips out only the ſkin) and afterwards with ebony buſhes (which are more prickly than thorn buſhes in this country) in order to let out the congealed blood. Dr. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon thinks the whipping too ſevere to be inflicted on any human being: he could lay two or three fingers into the wounds of a man whipped for not coming when he was called. Many receive from one hundred and fifty to two hundred laſhes at a time; and in two or three days this is repeated: they waſh the raw parts with pickle; this appears, from the convulſions it occaſions, more cruel than whipping; but it is done to prevent mortification. After ſevere whipping, they are worked all day without food, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept

The hand is cut off, if lifted up againſt a white man and the leg for running away. A planter ſent for a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon to cut off the leg of a Negro who had ran away. On the ſurgeon's refuſing to do it, the planter took an iron bar, and broke the leg in pieces, and then the ſurgeon took it off. This planter did many ſuch acts of cruelty, and all with impunity. The practice of dropping hot lead upon the Negroes, is here mentioned, H.

Another plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, is, the ſame iſland<note n="‡" place="bottom">Jamaica.</note>, deſtroyed forty ſlaves out of ſixty (in three years) by ſeverity. The reſt of the conduct of this infamous wretch was concealed by the Committee of the Houſe of Commons, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining circumſtances too horrible to be given to the world. We, however, go on to read of knocking on the head and ſtabbing, of a hot iron forced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the teeth, of a ſlave thrown into the boiling juice, and killed, of a Negro ſhot, and his head cut off. And it appears, that the women, deemed of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectability and rank, not only order and ſuperintend,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:024292_0052_0FC616D68031E958"/>
out ſometimes actually inflict with their own hands ſevere puniſhments on their ſlaves.</p>
            <p>The offences for which the before mentioned pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments are inflicted are, not coming into the field in time, not picking a ſufficient quantity of graſs, not appearing willing to work, when in fact ſick and not able; for ſtaying too long on an errand, for not coming immediately when called, for not bringing home (the women) the full weekly ſum enjoined by their owners; for running away, and for theft, to which they are often driven by hunger.</p>
            <p>Under the head of "extraordinary puniſhments," ſome appear to have ſuffered for running away, or for lifting up a hand againſt a white man, or for break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a plate, or ſpilling a cup of tea, or to extort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. Others again, in the moments of ſudden re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, and one on a diabolical pretext, which the maſter held out to the world to conceal his own vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainy, and which he <hi>knew</hi> to be <hi>falſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſlaves have little or no redreſs againſt ill uſage of any ſort; the laws to reſtrict puniſhment are a mere farce, and univerſally diſregarded, or when pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be obſerved, they are in divers ways ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually evaded: beſides, the evidence of a black is in no caſe whatever admitted againſt a white man; which circumſtance alone is enough to deprive the Negroes of all legal protection whatever, were the Laws, in other reſpects, ever ſo juſt and ſalutary. Lieutenant Davidſon was ſo hurt at the ſevere and frequent whippings of one of the women, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to a magiſtrate, who ſaid, "he had nothing to do with it."</p>
            <p>The particular inſtances mentioned in the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, of ſlaves dying in conſequence of ſevere and cruel treatment from their maſters, were not puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though generally known; nor do the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trators of theſe barbarities appear to have ſuffered any diſgrace!</p>

If you ſpeak to a Negro of future puniſhments, he ſays,—"Why ſhould a poor Negro be puniſhed? he does no wrong; fiery cauldrons, and ſuch things, are reſerved for white people, as puniſhments for the oppreſſion of ſlaves."</p>
            <p>In the FIFTH CHAPTER it is proved, by ſuch as have ſeen them in their own country, that the natives of Africa are equal to the Europeans in their natural capacities, feelings, affections, and moral character. They manufacture gold and iron, in ſome reſpects equal to the European artiſts—alſo cloth and leather with uncommon neatneſs; the former they did blue, yellow, brown and orange. They are ſkilled in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indigo and ſoap, and pottery wares, and prepare fall for their own uſe from the ſea water. They alſo make ropes with aloes. With reſpect to their moral character, they are very honeſt and hoſpitable grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and affectionate, harmleſs and innocent; punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in their dealings, and as capable of virtue as the whites. They are ſuſceptible of all the ſocial virtues: generoſity, fidelity, and gratitude, are allowed them by Dr. Stuart. Theſe virtues Dr. Jackſon enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, and adds charity to all in diſtreſs, and a ſtrong attachment on the part of parents to their children. T. Woolrich ſays, he never knew of an African, who could expreſs himſelf, that did not believe in the exiſtence of a Supreme Being.</p>
            <p>In the SIXTH and SEVENTH CHAPTERS it appears, that the natives poſſeſs induſtry and a ſpirit of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, ſufficient for carrying on a new trade; that their country abounds with, and might eaſily be made ſtill more productive of, many and various articles of commerce; but that the traffic in ſlaves is an inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable impediment to opening a new trade.</p>
            <p>In the TENTH CHAPTER it is proved not to be true, what ſome ſay, that the natives of Africa are happier in the European colonies than in their own
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:024292_0054_0FC616DCDAFFD5B0"/>
country. They love their own country, but deſtroy themſelves in the colonies, &amp;c. &amp;c. But any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon between the two ſituations, is (as H. Roſs ſays, though on another occaſion) <hi>
                  <q>an inſult to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe.</q>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ELEVENTH, TWELETH and THIRTEENTH CHAPTERS, are on the ſubject of Negro population in the colonies, and plainly ſhew that the importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of freſh Africans might immediately be ſuperceded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the introduction of general good treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and of certain ſalutary regulations therein ſuggeſted.</p>
            <p>The FOURTEENTH CHAPTER is employed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, from the evidence before the committee, that the coloniſts would be able to carry on the neceſſary cultivation of their lands, without a freſh importation of ſlaves, while the generation imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſucceeding the regulations propoſed were growing up, to ſupply the vacancies occaſioned by the natural deaths of the ſlaves of all ages, now is their poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>The FIFTEENTH CHAPTER enquires, whether there be not a prevailing opinion, in the colonies, that it is cheaper to buy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> import ſlaves than thus to increaſe them by population. And whether the very ſevere of this opinion be not true: namely, that it is more profitable to breed than to import. The reſult of this enquiry is clearly in favour of the <hi>immediate</hi> abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of the African ſlave-trade. The ſame may be ſaid of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>and laſt</hi> chapter, in which it is conſidered, whether is be more political to extend the cultivation of the colonies by the continuance of the ſlave-trade, or wait till the riſing generation ſhall be capable of performing it.</p>
            <p>Having thus taken a general view of the moſt ſtriking features of the evidence for the abolition of the traffic in the human ſpecies, as carried on by the
