            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>FIRST, THAT all men are by nature equally free and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent, and have certain inherent rights, of which, when they enter into a ſtate of ſociety, they cannot, by any c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2d. That all power is veſted in, and conſequently derived from, the people; that magiſtrates are their truſtees and ſervants, and at all times amenable to them.</p>
            <p n="3">3d. That government is, or ought to be inſtituted for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon benefit, protection and ſecurity, of the people, nation, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, of all the various modes and forms of government that is beſt, which is capable of producing the greateſt degree of happineſs and ſafety, and is moſt effectually ſecured againſt the danger of mal-adminiſtration; and that wherever any government ſhall be found inadequate or contrary to theſe purpoſes, a majority of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity hath an indubitable, unalienable, and indefe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="4">4th. That no man, or ſet of men, are intitled to excluſive or ſeparate emoluments or privileges from the community, but in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of public ſervices; which, not being deſcendible, neither ought the offices of magiſtrate, legiſlature, or judge, to be the hereditary.</p>
            <p n="5">5th. That the Legiſlative and Executive powers of the ſtate ſhould be ſeparate and diſtinct from the judicary; and that the members of the two firſt may be reſtrained from oppreſſion, by feeling and participating the burthens of the people, they ſhould at fixed periods, be reduced to a private ſtation, return into that body from which they were originally taken, and the vacancies be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by frequent, certain, and regular elections, in which all, or any part of the former members, to be again eligible, or ineligible, as the laws ſhall direct.</p>

That elections of members to ſerve as repreſentatives of the people, in Aſſembly, ought to be free, and that all men, having ſufficient evidence of permanent common intereſt with, and attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to, the community, have the right of ſuffrage, and cannot be taxed or deprived of their property for public uſes without their own conſent, or that of their repreſentatives ſo elected, nor bound by any law to which they have not, in like manner, aſſented for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic good.</p>
            <p n="7">7th. That all power of ſuſpending law, or the execution of laws, by any authority without conſent of the repreſentatives of the people, is injurious to their rights, and ought not to be exerciſed.</p>
            <p n="8">8th. That in all capital or criminal proſecutions, a man hath a right to demand the cauſe and nature of his accuſation, to be confronted with the accuſers and witneſſes, to call for evidence in his favor, and to a ſpeedy trial by an impartial jury of his vicinage, whithout whoſe unanimous conſent he cannot be found guilty, nor can he be compelled to give evidence againſt himſelf; that no man be deprived of his liberty, except by the law of the land, or the judgment of his peers.</p>
            <p n="9">9th. That exceſſive bail ought not to be required, nor exceſſive fines impoſed, nor cruel unuſual puniſhments inflicted.</p>
            <p n="10">10th. The general warrants, whereby any officer or meſſenger may be commanded to ſearch ſuſpected places without evidence of a fact committed, or to ſeize any perſon or perſons not named, or whoſe offence is not particularly deſcribed and ſupported by evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, are grievous and oppreſſive, and ought not to be granted.</p>
            <p n="11">11th. That in controverſies reſpecting property, and in ſuits between man and man, the ancient trial by jury is preferable to any other, and ought to be held ſacred.</p>
            <p n="12">12th. That the freedom of the preſs is one of the great bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks of liberty, and can never be reſtrained but by diſpotic governments.</p>
            <p n="13">13th. That a well regulated militia, compoſed of the body of the people trained to arms, is the proper, natural, and ſafe defence of a free ſtate; that ſtanding armies, in time of peace, ſhould be avoided, as dangerous to liberty; and that, in all caſes, the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="5 letters">

            <p n="14">14th. That the people have a right to uniform government; and therefore, that no government ſeparate from, or independent of the government of Virginia, ought to be erected or eſtabliſhed within the limits thereof.</p>
            <p n="15">15th. That no free government, or the bleſſing of liberty, can be preſerved to any people but by a fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That religion, or the duty which we owe to our CREA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOR, and the manner of diſcharging it, can be directed only by reaſon and conviction, not by force or violence, and therefore all men are equally entitled to the free exerciſe of religion, according to the dictates of conſcience; and that it is the mutual duty of all to practice Chriſtian forbearance, love, and charity, towards each other.</p>
