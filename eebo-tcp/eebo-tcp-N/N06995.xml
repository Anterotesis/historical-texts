            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

in the advancement of Chriſt's Kingdom, and the beſt Intereſt of that Body to which we belonged, we ſhall through the Merits of our Lord and Saviour, receive an ample Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, even a crown of life in the coming world. And of all Men it concerns us thus to Serve GOD and our Generation: for our Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are diſtinguiſhing, and our Obligations ariſe in Proportion to our Privileges and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages. The Word of GOD plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals, and ſtrictly enjoyns this, <hi>that more ſure Word of Prophecy, whereunto we do well that we take Heed.</hi> This is implied and inculcated in the Words of our Text. <hi>But as God hath diſtributed to every Man, as the Lord hath called every one, ſo let him walk.</hi> — The Duty enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with divine Authority is plain, altho' the Reward is not particularly mentioned: but all Goſpel Precepts, Encouragements and Exhortations are urged with this Motive, (viz.) That they who reject the divine Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and continue Obſtinate ſhall periſh in their Rebellion; while they that hearken, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and obey, through the efficacious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the Holy Ghoſt, ſhall for Jeſus's ſake, be gloriouſly and eternally Rewarded.</p>
            <p>Some indeed have thought theſe Words were connected with, and the Truth contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein, a natural and neceſſary Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence from what the Apoſtle had laid down
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:008888_0007_10309064575A9B70"/>
in the foregoing Verſes: But others ſuppoſe them to be the beginning of the following Diſcourſe, wherein he treats of Chriſtians of all Ranks and Orders abiding in their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Callings, and faithfully diſcharging the Duties thereof.</p>
            <p>This appears to me the Apoſtles Deſign; and thus I ſhall apply and improve the Text.</p>
            <p>The Words are very comprehenſive, and include all Men, of all Ranks, and of all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations; Men of every Station, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Character, from the higheſt to the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, that have any Gifts of any Kind or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, whereby they are capable of uſefulneſs in their Generation; as well him that has but one Talent, as him that hath five or ten. <hi>According as GOD hath diſtributed to him,</hi> ſo he is ſtrongly bound and obliged faithfully to improve his Gifts or Talents, and in that Calling wherein God hath called him. For the Apoſtle goes on and ſays, <hi>as the Lord hath called every one.</hi> That God who gives us dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Gifts, and qualifies us for different Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, hath called us thereunto, &amp; commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us to abide therein, &amp; faithfully diſcharge the ſeveral Duties thereof. <hi>As the Lord hath called every one, ſo let him walk</hi> — Let him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in the Poſt wherein God hath fixed him, and there let him act as one that expects to give an Account. Wherefore in treating
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:008888_0008_103090678138FD00"/>
upon the Words of the Text thus opened and explained, I ſhall Obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I.</hi> That God hath variouſly diſtributed his Gifts among Men, and qualified them for a Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Buſineſs in the World.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>II.</hi> As God hath diſtributed his Gifts unto Men, and qualified them for, ſo he hath called them to act their Part in different Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</p>

               <hi>III.</hi> Shew that it highly concerns every one to abide in his Office or Calling, and faithfully diſcharge the ſeveral Duties of it.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>IV.</hi> Conclude with an Addreſs to divers Orders of Men, humbly exhorting them faithfully to improve the Gifts which God hath given them in their reſpective Callings.</p>

               <hi>I.</hi> God hath variouſly diſtributed his Gifts among Men, and qualified them for a Diverſity of Buſineſs in the World.</p>
            <p>GOD has a great Work to be carried on in the World by Men as Inſtruments; and hath imparted Gifts to all, that every one may be buſily engaged, and afford an helping Hand

according to his Ability, and not a Man to be idle. And as there are various Parts of the ſame Work to be managed and perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſome of a more difficult Nature, and of greater Importance, and ſome of leſs, ſo he hath proportioned his Gifts accordingly. See Mat. 25.14, 15. <hi>For the Kingdom of Heaven is as a Man travelling into a far Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, who called his own Servants, and delivered unto them his Goods: and unto one he gave five Pounds, to another two, and to another one, to every Man according to his ſeveral ability; and ſtraightway took his Journey; ſaying unto them, occupy till I come.</hi> Luk. 19.13. Agreeably to this, the Apoſtle ſays, Rom. 12.6. <hi>Having then Gifts differing according to the Grace that is given us.</hi> This was ſpoken with immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Regard to the Church, conſidered as a religious Body. But it is true when applied to the State; &amp; likewiſe when to the Church and State; conſidered as a collective Body. Accordingly when we view the whole Body, we ſee Gifts of a different Kind, and differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Degree, diſperſed abroad among the Children of Men.</p>
            <p>God hath abundantly inriched ſome with royal Gifts and Graces, and qualified them to ſit upon the Throne, to wear the Crown and ſway the Sceptre: <hi>For it is by him that Kings reign and Princes decree Juſtice</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. 8.15.</note>.</p>

               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:008888_0010_1030906E5C175860"/>
To Others, he hath given Wiſdom and Underſtanding, ſagacious and penetrating. Minds, Quickneſs of Apprehenſion, and a firm unſhaken Reſolution, as well as Loyalty fitting for Miniſters of State, to ſit round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the King, and aſſiſt him in his impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Counſels.</p>
            <p>To Others, he hath given peculiar Gifts to govern in their reſpective Provinces: clothed them with a natural Authority in their very Make, and endowed them with an agreeable Mixture of Skill and Wiſdom, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and Meekneſs, Judgment &amp; Mercy, that all around are diſpoſed to honour and obey them with Freedom and Chearfulneſs.</p>
            <p>To Others he hath imparted the proper Gifts of Judges and Counſellors, diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with the Faculty of diſcerning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Right &amp; wrong, and endowing them with a ſteady Mind, and a Principle of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, that with courage and reſolution they may judge with righteous Judgment, <hi>juſtifying the righteous and condemning the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> agreeable to the Command given us in Deut. 25.1. And to theſe he hath variouſly diſtributed his Gifts, to ſome in greater De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, to others in leſs, as there are Poſts of Honour of the ſame Kind, but of a different Degree. As one is to act in a more elevated Station, and another in a leſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:008888_0011_10309070189C2BC0"/>
To others he hath given the Faculty of Speaking, and the Art ot reaſoning &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in Matters of Controverſy; that Right may take Place, and the innocent be cleared, while the guilty are puniſhed; and every one have Juſtice done him.</p>
            <p>And Others he hath formed for executive Juſtice, that our Rights may be maintained, Vice and Immorality ſuppreſſed, and the beſt good of the Common-wealth promoted.</p>
            <p>At the ſame Time our God, through the Riches of his Grace in Chriſt the Redeemer, <hi>who purchaſed the Church with his own Blood,</hi> hath furniſhed Others with Gifts and Graces ſuited to the important Work of the ſacred Miniſtry. And among theſe he hath vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly diſtributed his Gifts.</p>
            <p>To ſome he hath given great Degrees of Knowledge, both divine and humane, Depth of Judgment, and a large Acquaintance eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially with polemical Divinity, and ſet them with <hi>Paul</hi> for the Defence of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; Some he hath made Boanerges Sons of Thunder, to alarm the ſecure, and reform the profane: To ſome he hath given the Charms of Eloquence, that like <hi>Apollos</hi> of old, they have a diſtinguiſhing Faculty of alluring and perſwading weary and heavy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Sinners to caſt themſelves with all their Burdens upon the bleſſed Jeſus: Some he
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:008888_0012_1030907221700348"/>
hath endued with the Gift of opening and explaining the Scriptures, and of applying them rightly &amp; ſeaſonably to wounded Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences: And to others he hath given the happy Talent of healing Breaches and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Peace to broken Churches, and of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging and building them up unto the Kingdom of Glory.</p>
            <p>Some Degree of theſe Gifts all true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters have; but while ſome excel in one, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do in another. So that this being the Caſe, the Kingdom of the Redeemer is built up in the World, through the promiſed Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Bleſſing of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Intereſt of the Common-wealth greatly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced.</p>
            <p>And while God the glorious <hi>Author and Giver of every good &amp; perfect Gift,</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">James 1.17.</note> is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſome the Faculty of adminiſtring to, and healing the diſtempered Soul of its ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Maladies, as Inſtruments; he is furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others with Gifts ſuitable to adminiſter to, and heal the ſick and diſeaſed Body, through his ſovereign Bleſſing accompanying their Endeavours.</p>
            <p>Others, our God, who ſtiles himſelf <hi>a Man of War,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Exod. 15.3.</note> hath formed for the Field of Battle: <hi>He is their Strength, and teaches their Hands to war, and their Fingers to fight:</hi>

And he ſets them as Barriers to our Kingdom and Country; and makes them the formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, and yet glorious Defenders of our Rights, Liberties and Privileges.</p>
            <p>Some, God qualifies to manage Trade and mercantile Affairs even to the remoteſt Parts of the Earth, whereby a Kingdom is inrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and others are prepared to furrow the vaſt and wide Ocean, in their ſwift Ships to tranſport their Effects.</p>
            <p>And while ſome are moſt ingenious at Mechanicks, others well underſtand, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently purſue the Buſineſs of Huſbandry, and cultivate <hi>the Field</hi> by which <hi>the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is ſerved.</hi>

All theſe things are of God, that none may boaſt, but all be humble and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and improve their Gifts and Talents to the Honour of him that gave them, and learn that Leſſon, 1 Cor. 4.6, 7. <hi>Not to think of Men above that which is written, that no one be puſſed up for one againſt another.

            <p n="2">II. <hi>As God hath diſtributed his Gifts unto Men, and qualified them for, ſo he hath called them to act their Part in different Offices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But as God hath diſtributed to every Man, as the Lord hath called every one, ſo let him walk</hi>— As he hath diſtributed his Gifts unto Men, and thereby fitted them for Uſefulneſs in the World, ſome to act in an higher Station, and ſome in a lower; Some in a more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Capacity, and ſome in a more private; ſo he hath called every one to his own Work and Buſineſs, and bid us abide in our ſeveral Callings.</p>
            <p>As Man is made a ſociable Creature, and as the Deſign of his Maker was, that he ſhould be formed into Society; and as there are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Works of different Kinds and Degrees
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:008888_0015_1030907AA34678C8"/>
to be performed in every Society in Order to advance the good of the whole; ſo it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that one ſhould be fixed above another in a more dignified Station than his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; and each one exert himſelf in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Poſt, according to his ſeveral Ability. And thus God, the great Lord of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, who is all wiſe and infinitely good, a God of Order, and not of Confuſion, hath called and fixed every of us. He hath not only furniſhed us with Gifts, but aſſigned us a Work to exerciſe them in. And every One, according as his Talents are, and his Calling is, is under proportionable Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be diligent in Buſineſs, ſervent in Spirit, ſerving God and his Generation. † Indeed we have all one general Calling, and that is to be Chriſtians: But conſidered as Chriſtians, we have different Works aſſigned us, and we are called to different Offices.</p>
            <p>Some he hath called to civil Poſts of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, fixing them above their fellow-men in General, inveſting them with Authority from on high, ſome with greater Degrees, and ſome with leſs, and bidding them rule in the Fear of God. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.3. All ſuch are called of God, and their Authority is from him <hi>who rules in the Kingdom of Men. For Promotion cometh neither from the Eaſt, nor from the Weſt, nor from the South,</hi> no, nor
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:008888_0016_1030907D86332880"/>
from the North, <hi>But God is the Judge: He putteth down one, and ſetteth up another.</hi> Pſal. 75.6, 7. And becauſe God hath exalted them to an elavated Station, and clothed them with that Authority wherein they are to act in ſome Meaſure like himſelf, he hath <hi>called them Gods,</hi> but at the ſame Time, told them that <hi>they ſhould die like Man,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. 82.6 7.</note> that they may be humble and dependant, and walk righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly before him. The Apoſtle confirms this in the new Teſtament, and ſays, Rom. 13.1, 2, 4. <hi>For there is no Power but of God: The Powers that be, are ordained of God. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever therefore reſiſteth the Power, reſiſteth the Ordinance of God: and they that reſiſt ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to themſelves Damnation. For he is the Miniſter of God to Thee for good.</hi> And having called them to, and fixed them in their ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated Poſts, he bids them abide therein, and improve their ſuperior Gifts and Advantages for the beſt good of the Community in which his Providence hath made them Rulurs. Their Calling and Buſineſs is, to conſult the Intereſt of the Common-wealth, to enact Laws which have a direct Tendency to promote the good of the whole, and ſee them well executed. In all which, they are to have Reſpect to the <hi>Law of God, which is exceeding broad,</hi> and ſee to it, that all their Laws are conſiſtent with, and conſonant to the divine
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:008888_0017_1030907F2F8F3778"/>
Law, as they would anſwer the great and glorious Ends of Government. Indeed it is of the laſt Importance, that civil Rulers be well acquainted with the Law of God, and poſſeſſed of the Goſpel Religion; that they <hi>be renewed in the Spirit of their Minds,</hi> and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to Jeſus Chriſt by a living Faith which is productive of all good Works. It is ſo, as they would be emminently ſerviceable to the Common-wealth, and able to give a good Account of their Stewardſhip, and receive that bleſſed Sentence, in the great and laſt Day, recorded, Mat. 25.21. <hi>Well done thou good and faithful Servant; Thou haſt been faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful over a few things, I will make Thee Ruler over many things: enter Thou into the Joy of thy Lord.</hi> Civil Rulers ſtand in the cauſe of God, and they rule for God; they are his Vice-gerents, and the Judgment they paſs is the Lord's. Wherefore it concerns them to ſecure the divine Preſence, and act under the Influence of the divine Spirit; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring the Charge given them, 2 Chron. 19.6. <hi>Take Heed what ye do; for ye judge not for Man, but for the Lord, who is with you in in the Judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Civil Rulers ſhould be wiſe and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Men, eſpecially ſhould they well underſtand the Buſineſs of their exalted Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Wo to Thee, O Land, when thy King is
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:008888_0018_103090858817F9C8"/>
a Child.</hi> i. e. when civil Rulers are unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with their proper Work and Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But happy are they who have Rulers that are Men of Skill and Wiſdom to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert Meaſures for their Peace and Safety; for <hi>by Men of Underſtanding and Knowledge, the State is prolonged.</hi> Wherefore the Direction given in this Caſe is, Deut. 1.13. <hi>Take ye wiſe Men and underſtanding, and well known among your Tribes, and I will make them Rulers over you.</hi> Moreover, civil Rulers ſhould be Men of Righteouſneſs, and free from Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality. The Sceptre of our God is a Sceptre of Righteouſneſs; and the righteous Lord loveth Righteouſneſs, and hateth Iniquity. <hi>Holy, juſt and true are all the Adminiſtrations of his Providence, and clear and righteous are all his Ways, and all his Judgments.</hi> And civil Rulers are to imitate him in Point of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. As God reſpects not the Perſon of any, ſo neither ſhould civil Rulers; <hi>for they judge for the Lord.</hi> The celebrated Judge HALE would not receive a Preſent at the Hands of a Man, whoſe cauſe he was about to judge, knowing that a <hi>Gift,</hi> as the wiſe Man expreſſes it, Prov. 17.8. <hi>is as a precious Stone in the Eyes of him that receiveth it; whitherſoever it turneth, it proſpereth.</hi> It dazzles the Eyes, and perverts the Judgment of him that receives it. It tends to this, and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:008888_0019_1030908780AED9B8"/>
hath this Effect, (it is to be feared,) on ſome' but (we hope) not on all. It would be well for Rulers and Judges to look upon Perſons as Strangers in ſome Senſe, as unknown by them, when they are about to judge their Cauſe, and judge with Righteous Judgment. Lev. 19.15 <hi>Ye ſhall do no unrighteouſneſs in Judgment: Thou ſhalt not reſpect the Perſon of the poor, nor honour the Perſon of the mighty; but in Righteouſneſs ſhalt thou judge thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</hi> And ſee Deut. 1.17. <hi>Ye ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect Perſons in Judgment, but you ſhall hear the ſmall as well as the great.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, civil Rulers ſhould be of an undaunted Courage and Reſolution, Firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mind, and a ſteadfaſt Reſolution to maintain the Honour, and anſwer the Ends of Government are highly neceſſary in all that wield the Sword of Juſtice, that they may put an End to Vice as much as poſſible, and promote Religion and Virtue. And it concerns them to put on Courage, and at all Times carry an even Hand, paying no ſlaviſh Regard to the Frowns, nor the Flatteries of Men. Deut. 1.17. <hi>You ſhall not be afraid of the Face of man, for the Judgment is God's.</hi> They are ſet for a Terror to evil Doers, and for a Praiſe to them that do well.</p>
            <p>Moreover, civil Rulers ſhould be Men of Kindneſs and Mercy. Our God is a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:008888_0020_103090897388B020"/>
God, &amp; Mercy his beloved Attribute. <hi>He pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties his People under all their Afflictions and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens as a Father pities his Children.</hi> And ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Rulers are the Fathers of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, who ſhould have a tender Concern for the Rights and Intereſts of the People, and ever conſult their Happineſs; endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour that they may enjoy their Liberties, and ſtudy to alleviate their Burdens as much as poſſible. All our Eyes are upon them, and eſpecially do the Eyes of the needy wait on them for Help and Relief, and the injured for Redreſs. They ſhould look upon it, as their Privilege, as well as Duty, to ſhew Compaſſion to the Common-People under all their Wants and Grievances; and be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to afford all reaſonable Encouragement to every thing found among them laudable and commendable. And although it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes them, with an undaunted Courage to frown upon Vice, and puniſh Criminals, yet it ſhould be done with a tender Heart, and a compaſſionate Mind; not as if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in Cruelty, but as being neceſſitated to act as they do in Point of Righteouſneſs, and in Order to maintain the Honour of Religion, and the Safety of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
            <p>Moreover, civil Rulers ſhould be of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous publick Spirit. Our God is infinitely
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:008888_0021_1030908C4AE07450"/>
good in himſelf, and in the Communications of his Goodneſs unto us, Mat. 5.45. <hi>He maketh his Sun to riſe on the evil, and on the good; and ſendeth Rain on the juſt, and on the unjuſt.</hi> So ſhould civil Rulers diffuſe their Bleſſings abroad, and be rich in all good Works that tend to promote the Intereſt of the Community. As civil Fathers, they ſhould have an affectionate Concern for the Rights of the People, looking upon their Intereſts as their own, and eſteeming the flouriſhing State of the Common-wealth, their own Security and Proſperity. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſays, 1 Cor. 10.24. <hi>Let no Man ſeek his own;</hi> not his own, only; but every Man anothers Wealth. And again, 1 Cor. 13.5. <hi>Charity,</hi> that Godlike Principle of Charity which ſhould be in every Heart, and eſpecially in the Hearts of Rulers, and which is abſolutely neceſſary to conſtitute a good and profitable Man, <hi>ſeeketh not her own.</hi> Nor her own only, but anothers. It is not private, narrow and ſelfish, but open, free and generous, concerned for the publick good. And indeed we can take no Method that will advance our Intereſt ſo readily, as to ſtudy and purſue the good of the publick.</p>
            <p>Once more here, civil Rulers ſhould be Men fearing God, and practiſing real Piety. Their Buſineſs is, to enact good and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:008888_0022_103090905061F458"/>
Laws, and then ſhew their Regard to them by an agreeable Walk and Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Examples in Rulers, if bad, will have a Multitude of Followers; and let them be ever ſo ſtrict in puniſhing Delinquents, it will ſignify little or nothing towards reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, if at the ſame Time, they ſhew a diſregard to the Laws themſelves. But if, on the contrary, they live peaceable and quiet Lives, in all Godlineſs, and appear to be Men that fear the Lord and hate Covetouſneſs, their Example will be likely to influence all around them. If the political Head is ſick, the whole Body will be faint, but if the Head is in a good State of Health, the Body will be well. When Kings of old ruled well, and lived well, <hi>Things went well in Judah.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there are always Exceptions under ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rules; but in the Nature and Order of things, ſuch a Practice in Heads or Rulers has this Tendency. Thus briefly, theſe things, this Temper and Practice in Rulers are of happy Conſequence. And having theſe Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications, and being fixed in Poſts of Honor by divine Providence, it becomes them to abide in their Calling, and diligently perform the ſeveral Duties of their Office, ruling for GOD, and the good of the People. <hi>So let them Walk.</hi>— Let them abide in their Poſts, and ſtudy to do their own Buſineſs. See the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:008888_0023_10309093782D7840"/>20th Verſe of the Context; <hi>Let every Man abide in the ſame Calling wherein he is called.</hi> Let him give himſelf eſpecially to this Work; although under our preſent Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, he may be obliged to buſy himſelf, at Times, in ſome of the common Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Life, yet let this Work bear its due Weight upon his Mind: Let him labour for the greateſt Acquaintance with the Nature of it, and the ſeveral Duties belonging to it, and be always ready to perform them in in ſuch a Manner, as ſhall tend to advance the Intereſt of Religion, and of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity.</p>
            <p>And while God is furniſhing ſome with Gifts ſuited to manage this great and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Work, and calling them to it; he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes others with Gifts and Graces ſuited to carry on the glorious Work of the Miniſtry, and calls them to that. A difficult but an honourable Work, and a Work of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Importance. Of all Men, it concerns the Ambaſſadors of Chriſt, the Miniſters of the everlaſting Goſpel to be Men of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; to be well acquainted with their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Will, and do the Work of the Lord faithfully. 'Tis of infinite Importance that they be converted to God by the Power of divine Grace, and experimentally, as well as doctrinally acquainted with the Methods
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:008888_0024_10309095808AA430"/>
of Grace, and with the Operations of the holy Ghoſt in convincing and converting Sinners from the Power of Sin and Satan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the living and true God; and in building them up in Faith and Holineſs unto his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Kingdom: <hi>That they be wiſe and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, apt to teach, and able rightly to divide the Word of Truth, giving to every one his Portion in due Seaſon: That they be exemplary in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, in Faith, in Charity and in Purity;</hi> and that they have a ſincere View at the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Redeemer, and be heartily engaged for the Eternal Salvation of precious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Souls. It infinitely concerns us to meditate on the Duties of our Office, <hi>and give ourſelves wholly to them;</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Tim. 4.15</note> and <hi>deliver all the Counſel of God, and to be pure from the Blood of all Men.</hi>
               <note n="|" place="bottom">Acts 20.26.</note> It highly concerns us to be engaged to ſecure the divine Preſence, that we may go forth from Time to Time, in the Fulneſs of the Bleſſings of the Goſpel of Peace, and offer well beaten Oil. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us to preach a crucified Saviour, and all the Doctrines inculcated in his Goſpel: The Fall of Man by Sin, his moral Depravity and Impotency — Redemption by Chriſt alone, the great Mediator of the Covenant of Grace — The Doctrine of the everbleſſed and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Trinity — And God's Sovereignty in the Diſplays of his Grace in the Salvation of
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:008888_0025_1030909980CD71C0"/>
Sinners through the Blood of Chriſt— The abſolute Neceſſity of ſpiritual Regeneration in Order to live to God here, and enjoy him for ever — Free Juſtification through the mediatorial Righteouſneſs of Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by Faith — And the Neceſſity of the efficacious Influences of the holy Spirit to carry on the Work of Sanctification in the Hearts of Believers — A Life of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance towards God, Love to God and our neighbour, a Chriſtian Spirit, and an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Life, as Evidences of a gracious State, and the Way leading to eternal Bleſſedneſs. Yea it concerns us to preach up all moral Duties in their Place, but charge our People to remember that neither theſe, nor Faith itſelf have any ſhare in our Juſtification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, as if there was any Merit therein: And let them know that the Atonement of Chriſt is the ſole meritorious Cauſe of that, while Faith is the inſtrumental Cauſe, or that by which we receive the Merit of the Redeemer's Blood: a Faith which works by Love, purifies the Heart, and influences to new Obedience. It concerns us alſo to preach the Doctrine of the Reſurrection of the Body at the laſt Day — of a future ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Judgment — and an eternal State of Rewards and Puniſhments aſſigned to every one according as he is found at Death. Thus
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:008888_0026_1030909C88475AB0"/>
in a Word, it becomes the Miniſters of Chriſt, (being qualified and called of God, and regularly introduced into the work;) It becomes them to abide and <hi>walk as the Lord hath called them.</hi> While the civil Ruler is to wait on his Ruling, the Goſpel Miniſter is to wait on his Miniſtry. And while God is placing ſome in the Chair of Government, and calling Others to the Work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry; he is commanding others to march into the Camp, and to meet the Enemy in the Field of Battle; and others, the main Body of the People to manage the common Buſineſs of Life. And there is a great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Buſineſs beſides that of the Magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracy and Miniſtry, to manage which the Generality of the People are called, ſome to do this, and others that, every one having his particular Office, and ſomething to do. There is none omitted, or paſſed by, nor need any be uſeleſs, but all ſerviceable, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one performing his Part to advance the good of the whole, and ſo anſwering the great End of his Being. There is not a Member of the Body politick to be deſpiſed; nor may one glory over another, as if he ſtood in no Relation to him, or had no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon him. We are all mutually dependant upon, and obliged to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And if he that is fixed in the loweſt Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:008888_0027_1030909FB2F6F388"/>
and called to the meaneſt Office, <hi>walks as he is called,</hi> and faithfully diſcharges the Duties of his Poſt, he is a profitable Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and he that is called to a more eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Station cannot ſay, he has no need of him. As it is in the natural Body, ſo it is in the civil and religious. 1 Cor. 12.21. <hi>The Eye cannot ſay unto the Hand, I have no need of Thee; nor again the Head to the Feet, I have no need of you.</hi> Thus God, the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Lord of the univerſe, hath called us to, and fixed us in different Poſts, in which we are to act our Part, and not interfere with, nor interrupt one another; but every one mind his own Buſineſs and do his own work. Which brings me to ſay,</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>It highly concerns every one to abide in his own Calling or Office, and faithfully diſcharge the ſeveral Duties of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As God hath diſtributed to every Man, as the Lord hath called every one, ſo let him walk</hi>— Let him keep his Poſt and exert himſelf therein. But here I will offer a few things which may ſerve to illuſtrate the Point, and excite to the Duty.</p>

And in the 20th ver. <hi>Let every Man abide in the ſame Calling, wherein he is called.</hi> And, I Theſ. 4.11. <hi>That ye ſtudy to be quiet, and to do your own Buſineſs</hi> We have no Right nor Liberty to leave our own Office, and invade anothers. Kings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as Kings, have no Right to invade the Office of the Goſpel Miniſter; nor may the wiſeſt of Rulers break over into that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Incloſure; much leſs may illeterate, unſkilful Men, who need to be taught the firſt Principles of Religion. King <hi>Uzziah</hi> attempted to offer Incenſe upon the Altar, and God ſmote him with a Leproſy, and he was a Leper to the Day of his Death. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26th Chap. So neither ſhould Goſpel Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters leave their proper work and Buſineſs, and intermeddle too much with the Affairs of State. When they begin to ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up for States-men, in Oppoſition to thoſe that are qualified, and called to that Work, it preſently introduces Confuſion, and tends to weaken the common Cauſe. So when they involve themſelves in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Buſineſs of Life, and neglect that Work to which the Lord hath eſpecially called them, it is very hurtful to the Intereſt
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:008888_0029_103090A5D8509430"/>
of the Church and State. This undoubtedly opens a Door for Men, that have no Right, to invade their Office. It was an Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one Mr. <hi>Strong,</hi> whom Mr. <hi>Flavel</hi> mentions as an eminent and judicious Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, <q>That God hath permitted ſo many to intrude into the Miniſters Calling, becauſe Miniſters have too much meddled with, and intruded into other Men's Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</q> God has not required this at our Hands, nor do we anſwer the End of our Gifts, by neglecting our own Work, and undertaking that which properly belongs to another, although we are ever ſo engaged, and ever ſo laborious in it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>To abide in our own Callings, and exert our Gifts therein, is the way to promote a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reformation, real Religion, and the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the Community.</hi> As we would ſee the Redeemers Kingdom flouriſh, and the Common-wealth in Peace and Proſperity, it concerns us, One and all, to fly to our Poſts, and be induſtrious in our Callings, and cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate Religion in our own Hearts. If all acted in this manner, we ſhould have wiſe, merciful and righteous Rulers, of a publick Spirit, who would be careful to enact whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Laws, and ſee them put in Execution; to ſet Shining Examples of Piety, and uſe their Influence to promote univerſal Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:008888_0030_103090A8B0712368"/>
We ſhould have a learned, a pious and a faithful Miniſtry, who would have the Intereſt of Religion at Heart. And we ſhould be an induſtrious, thankful and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal People. We ſhould be <hi>like Trees planted by the Rivers of Water which take Root down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and bear Fruit upward, and bring forth their Fruit in the Seaſon thereof.</hi> Our Houſes would be Houſes of Prayer, and we ſhould be careful to cultivate real Religion in the Hearts of our Children, and bring them up in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Aſſiſtance; teaching them the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and the Way of Life by Jeſus Chriſt; and Loyalty and Submiſſion to law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Authority, as well as an honourable Eſteem for the Goſpel Miniſtry. This would empty Taverns of Throngs and Crowes of Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Inhabitants, and ſweep our Streets of Swarms of idle Drones, and prevent ten thouſand Miſchiefs felt by Reaſon of thoſe that deſert their Callings, and hide their Talents. This would prevent Evil-Surmiſings, Vain-Bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, Intemperance, unlawful Gaming, and all Manner of Unrighteouſneſs; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, Multitudes of needleſs and charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Law-Suits. This would give a Check to all Kinds of Vice and Immorality, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Religion and Virtue. We ſhould then <hi>ſeek firſt the Kingdom of God, and his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>;
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:008888_0031_103090AB8E18F688"/>
and do good to Mankind, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to the Community, to which we belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This would heal our Breaches, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Peace and good Order; and we ſhould go on with one Heart, and one Mind in ways that lead to our trueſt Happineſs. We ſhould then be diligent in Buſineſs, and faithful in our Betruſtments, and not hinder, but help one another, not aggravate, but alleviate each others Burthens. And in this Way, every one from the greateſt to the leaſt, might do ſomething towards a general Reformation, and ſtrengthening and enriching the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth. But if we deſert our Callings, and neglect our Gifts, we ſhall hinder, and not promote the bleſſed Work, and impover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh and waſte the Community, and enrich it. We ſhall do nothing towards advancing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, nor the common good, unleſs we act in that Sphere, in which God hath fixed us. 2 Tim. 2.5. <hi>If any Man ſtrive for Maſteries, yet is he not crowned, except he ſtrive lawfully.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>To walk as the Lord hath called us, and well improve the Gifts diſtributed to us, is the way to be able to give a good Account of ourſelves in the Day of the Lord, and receive a glorious Reward through the Merits of Chriſt.</hi> We have our ſeveral Talents delivered to us, and <hi>the Lord hath called us</hi> to our Work, and bid us <hi>occupy till he comes.</hi> We are all in the
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:008888_0032_103090AD521BF4B0"/>
Place of Stewards, and muſt in a little Time; <hi>give an Account of our Stewardſhip.</hi> Luke 16.2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whether we have waſted our Lord's Goods, or improved them well, we muſt give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and be rewarded according as we are found, And we ſhall ſtand alike round about the Throne of our impartial and almighty Judge, rich and poor, high and low, Rulers and ruled, <hi>and bleſſed ſhall they be, whom their Lord when he comes, ſshall find ſo doing.</hi> Mat. 24.46. In the Poſt where God hath fixed them, and performing as he commanded them. If we are found out of our Callings; doing what is forbidden, or abuſing our Gifts; we may expect nothing but to be frowned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the bliſsful Preſence of the great Judge: But if we are doing the Will of God, we may give up our Accounts with of Joy, and ſhall be made unſpeakably Happy for ever in the immediate Enjoyment of God himſelf, to the Praiſe of ſovereign Grace in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Another Motive I ſhall offer to excite every one to Diligence and Faithfulneſs in the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Gifts, in the Calling wherewith God called us, may be a Conſideration of the remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Diſpenſations of divine Providence towards us, is the Year paſt.</hi> God's diſpenſations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us in the Year paſt have been quite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable; and call aloud to every One to
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:008888_0033_103090B0252AADD0"/>
Mind his own Buſineſs, and do his own Work, and make ready to appear before him.</p>
            <p>In his holy and righteous Providence he hath ſeen fit to take away by Death, our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious King GEORGE the SECOND, of bleſſed Memory; the civil Father of the Engliſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and a moſt indulgent Father: who in his Life, was ever concerned for, and tender of the Rights and Liberties of his Britiſh <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> In whoſe happy Reign and under whole bleſſed Influence, the Nation, for a long Time, enjoyed the greateſt of Liberties and beſt of Privileges. And verily his Death gave the whole Kingdom a Shock, and was enough to put every Subject upon a ſerious Enquiry; what have we done, that God is provoked to take our King and our Head from us? And this little Province hath ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Reaſon to be alarmed, to awake, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take ourſelves to God, and put our Truſt and Confidence in him, and look unto him for the ſanctification of this awful Providence: For he was a Father to us indeed, from whom we received large Benefits in a Time when greatly needed. We ſhould even ſunk under the Weight of our heavy Burdens in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diſtreſſing War, had not we been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged and ſupported by him. But he is gone. The mighty is fallen before Death, <hi>the King of Terrors</hi>: That mighty Monarch,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:008888_0034_103090B568A3F610"/>
and greatly beloved hath taken up Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the Dwellings of Darkneſs; and he will think no more for us, and can do no more for us.</p>
            <p>This is a loud Call of divine Providence to us all, to abide in our Callings, well improve our Time, and our Gifts, and prepare to meet the Lord our Judge. Hereby they that are ſtiled Gods in the ſacred Oracles, ſee that they muſt die as other Men. If Kings die, certainly their Subjects muſt, from the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to the loweſt. Wherefore it concerns us, one and all, to hearken to the voice of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and ſtand &amp; mourn, and return to our Duty. And agreeable to King Solomon's Advice, Eccl. 9.10. <hi>Do what our Hands find to do, with all our Might; for there is no Work, nor Device, nor Knowledge, nor Wiſdom in the Grave, whether we are going.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, it has been a Time of great Mortality throughout this Land: Multitudes both at Home and in our Armies have died, and the Places that knew them, will know them here no more. And by their Deaths, God ſays to us that are alive, be ye alſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; every one to his Poſt, and ſtand waiting for the Coming of your Lord.</p>
            <p>But then, on the other Hand, we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Favours in the midſt of our Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, And while <hi>God's Judgments ſhould learn
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:008888_0035_103090B726559170"/>
us Righteouſneſs, his Goodneſs ſhould lead us to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi> Although it hath pleaſed Almighty God to take away by Death King GEORGE <hi>the Second,</hi> of bleſſed Memory, one of the beſt of Kings; yet he took him away <hi>in a good old Age, full of Days, Riches and Honour,</hi> as we read of King David, in 1 Chron. 29.28. And he left GEORGE the Third, his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to reign in his ſtead. On whom the Eyes of the Britiſh Nation are fixed, and in whom their Expectations are greatly raiſed.</p>
            <p>One early and richly endowed with all roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Gifts and Graces; and through whoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence we hope for the Enjoyment of the beſt of Liberties and Privileges for a great while to come.</p>
            <p>His acceſſion to the Throne was ordered in the moſt favourable Manner; all as one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in it; no Uſurper, nor vain Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der interpoſing. And immediately upon his Acceſſion, he iſſued out an excellent Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, enjoyning all his Subjects, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially all in Commiſſion, to uſe their Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to ſuppreſs Vice and Immorality, and encourage Religion and Virtue. Will God Almighty be with him and bleſs him, and make him a rich and laſting Bleſſing to his Church and People!</p>
            <p>And this favourable Providence ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite Gratitude in every Mind, and quicken
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:008888_0036_103090B8DC8E3DE0"/>
us to <hi>walk as the Lord hath called us.</hi> In Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to this, God hath granted abundant Succeſs to our Arms in all Parts, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Land.</p>
            <p>Brigadier General <hi>Murray</hi> with an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of Men, under the divine Direction and Influence, defeated a numerous Army in their bloody Deſigns againſt <hi>Qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>beck,</hi> early in the Spring. And in the beginning of <hi>September</hi> General <hi>Amherſt</hi> with his Army arrived, and landed on the South-Weſt Part of <hi>Montreal,</hi> General <hi>Murray</hi> upon the North-Eaſt, while Colonel <hi>Haviland</hi> advanced upon the South-Eaſt, all at one critical Juncture, under the Influence and auſpicious Smiles of Heaven. And that important Place, important to us, ſoon ſurrendred; A Place which hath been a Terror and a Deſtruction to thoſe our northern Colonies, ſurrendred to the Britiſh Crown. A Mercy greatly deſired, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly prayed for; and a Mercy granted in a Manner favourable vaſtly beyond our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations. And verily ſuch remarkable Diſpenſations; Such Frowns on the one Hand, and ſuch Favours on the other, are a loud Call to every one to ſeek the God of our Salvations, to betake ourſelves to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Poſts, and diligently attend upon the Work and Buſineſs of our Callings. <hi>As God hath diſtributed to every Man, as the
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:008888_0037_103090BCE7599FA8"/>
Lord hath called every one, ſo let him walk</hi>— And from theſe Conſiderations it appears to be a matter of the greateſt Importance.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. I will now Conclude with a ſhort Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to ſeveral Orders of Men, humbly exhorting them to improve their Gifts in their reſpective Callings.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I would humbly addreſs the honourable, the Governour, the Deputy Governour, and the whole hounorable Aſſembly at preſent convened to act in their elevated Poſts, for the beſt good of this Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>May it pleaſe your Honours, I am here by your Call and Invitation; therefore, <hi>I beſeech you, ſuffer the word of Exhortation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have the greateſt Reaſon to bleſs God, <hi>the Author and Giver of every good and perfect Gift,</hi> that he is raiſing up Men from Time to Time, and furniſhing them with Gifts ſuitable to ſtand in the Gate, as <hi>Job</hi> expreſſeth it.<note n="*" place="bottom">Job 21 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> And we have Reaſon to bleſs God for the Liberty of chooſing Men for this Purpoſe; and that he is pleaſed to incline and direct us in the Choice of ſuch. We are ſenſible that a great Weight lies upon you: but that God who hath called you to the work, is able to ſupport and direct
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:008888_0038_103090BFC364F138"/>
you in it. The great Lord of the Univerſe ſtiles you <hi>Gods</hi>; intimating thereby, that you are to imitate him in his imitable Pefecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: But then he tells you, <hi>that you muſt die like Men</hi>: Intimating that you ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly maintain a Senſe of your Frailty and Mortality, and act as thoſe that muſt give an Account. You are the Fathers of the Common-wealth, and all our Eyes are upon you.</p>
            <p>Wherefore ſee to it that your Powers of Mind are ſanctified by Grace; and always remember that you judge for the Lord. Look with an impartial Eye into all Matters laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, and act with a generous Spirit in whatever you do for the Government. Let the Intereſt of Religion, and the Welfare of the Community, (which indeed are neceſſarily connected) let theſe lye near your Hearts.</p>
            <p>And we would commend the Goſpel Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry to you Care and Protection. We thank your Honours for your Care of us, and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to us: and intreat you ever to encourage alearned, a pious and an Orthodox Miniſtry among us. We would alſo commend to your fatherly Care and Protection, the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege in this Government; and would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you for Jeſus's ſake, as you regard the flouriſhing of his Kingdom; to think of its preſent Situation, and uſe your Influence to
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:008888_0039_103090C2D0B5E0B8"/>ſuppreſs Vice and Extravagancy, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage and promote real Piety and chriſtian Virtue, as well as good Learning there; And we intreat you to encourage good Schooling among us, in all our Towns and Societies, that Knowledge and Religion may be cultivated throughout your Province. We would alſo commend to your Care and Encouragment, Trade and Manufactures, and eſpecially Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture: Let the Huſbandman ever be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred by you; for if our Huſbandry fails, we ſhall all, in a little Time, dwindle away to nothing.</p>
            <p>Continue, we intreat you to encourage the Soldiery in this critical Juncture of Affairs, who go forth and endure Hardſhips for our Lives and Liberties. Our Burdens are great and heavy, I am ſenſible, but God hath help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hitherto. We have been abundantly ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in our Warlike Enterprizes, which is Matter of great Encouragment.</p>
            <p>And we would recommend it to you in all your Counſels, Acts and Judgments, to be of a calm and ſteady Mind, to carry an even Hand, and never be precipitate in your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions and Determinations, and eſpecially when the Caſe is Dark and intricate, and of great Consequence. <hi>Let your Moderation be known to all men,</hi> and let your Example in holy Converſation ſhine before the People,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:008888_0040_103090C4C80106C8"/>
that they may take Pattern by you, <hi>and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low you, as far as ye follow Chriſt your Lord and Maſter,</hi> remembring that you are under the lnſpection of an Omniſcient Judge, as well as we. And he is not afraid to ſay to unrighteous Rulers, ye are wicked: and it would be amazingly awful to fall from ſuch an elevated Poſt, into the Regions of Horror and Deſpair. O dread the dreadful Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence! and ſee that your Hearts are right with God, and act with a ſincere View at the advancement of his Glory, and the good of your People. And God, the God of Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings be with you, and afford you his Preſence and Aſſiſtance, and make you eminent Bleſſings in your honourable Callings, and finally receive you to immortal Honour in his heavenly Kingdom, for Jeſus's ſake, your mighty Redeemer, where you ſhall be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly exalted, and rejoice triumphantly with Moſes and Joſhua, and all the true Servants of God for ever and ever.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>I would humbly Addreſs my Fathers and Brethren of the Goſpel Miniſtry.</hi> Reverend Sirs; you are <hi>called of God</hi> to a difficult, but an important, and a glorious Work. Of all Men, we moſt need the divine Preſence and Aſſiſtance; for we are acting immediately for the Lord, and the Salvation of precious and immortal Souls; the loſs of one of which
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:008888_0041_103090C8C4FAC3D8"/>
would be greater than the loſs of the whole World. Therefore, ſince <hi>we are to watch for Souls as they that muſt give an Account, let us take Heed to ourſelves, and to the Flocks over which the holy Ghoſt hath made us Overſeers. Let us deliver all the Counſel of God,</hi> preach all the Doctrines of the Goſpel, and urge them with all the weighty Arguments that can be offered: <hi>Let us be inſtant in Seaſon, and out of Seaſon, enduring Hardſhips as good Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and not be weary in well doing, knowing that we ſhall reap in due Time, if we faint not.</hi> Let us mind our own Buſineſs, and ſhine in our own Orbs; let us ſtudy the Mind and Will of God, <hi>and bring out of our Treaſuries, things new and old, and feed our People with Knowlege and with Underſtanding.</hi> Let us be determined above every Thing elſe, to know and preach Jeſus Chriſt, and him Crucified: Let us urge Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance unfeigned towards God, and Faith towards our Lord Jeſus, and in their turn treat of all the Branches of chriſtian Morality. Let us teach our People to fear God, and honour the King, to pray for all in Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to love and honour their Rulers, and pay a chearful Regard to their good and wholſom Laws. Let us labour in our Work to culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Religion in our own Hearts, and in the Hearts of our People, of all Ranks and Orders;
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:008888_0042_103090CBA2E99F40"/>
That they and we may well underſtand our Duty, abide in our Callings, and be diligent in our own Buſineſs, Bleſſings to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and Inſtruments of building up the Redeemer's Kingdom. And while we preach Peace and Salvation to others, let us labour to be at Peace among ourſelves. Let us ſtrive that brotherly Love may continue and abound among us, and be always ready to ſupport each others Character, and aſſiſt one another under all our Tryals in our great and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Work; not hinder, but forward one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother's Uſefulneſs as much as poſſible. And for Encouragement, we ſerve a glorious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, who has ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed is that Servant whom his Lord, when he cometh ſhall find ſo doing.</hi> Then let us ſee that our Hearts, our Views, our Aims, and our Ends are right, and be faithful unto Death, and then ſhall we receive a Crown of Life, and ſhine as the Stars of Heaven for ever and ever.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And to conclude, <hi>I would addreſs the Body of the People now aſſembled before the Lord.</hi> And ſuffer me to exhort and intreat you in the Name of our Lord Jeſus, <hi>to walk as the Lord hath called you.</hi> Abide in your Callings, and look to the living God for the renewing and ſanctifying Influences of his bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and as God hath diſtributed his Gifts unto you, ſo improve them to his Honour and
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:008888_0043_103090CD5468E250"/>
Glory; and labour to be as uſeful and ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as poſſible, to the Community, in your Day and Generation. Although you are not promoted to the Magiſtracy, nor called to the Miniſtry; yea, although you may not be fixed in any publick Poſts of Honour, nor called to act in a publick Capacity, yet you are a free People, indulged with the greateſt of Liberties and beſt of Privileges, and under great Advantages to ſerve God and your Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. The chief Captain of the <hi>Roman</hi> Soldiery ſaid, Acts 22.28. <hi>With a great Sum obtained I this Freedom.</hi> A Freedom not equal to yours, which you have upon free Coſt. You have the Liberty of chuſing your own Rulers, and your own Miniſters; and Liberty to worſhip God according to the dictates of your own Conſciences. And that you are governed by reaſonable Laws, and obliged to ſubmit to lawful Authority in what is juſt and right, is your Privilege, and not your Burthen. We are all, even Rulers themſelves, and Miniſters of the Goſpel, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the ſame Laws, as the common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and we are all Members of the ſame Common-wealth. Wherefore, bleſs God for your ineſtimable Privileges, and look upon yourſelves the highly favoured of the Lord. Be contented with your own Poſts, diligently
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:008888_0044_103090D05F530EE8"/>
attend upon your own Buſineſs, and do your own Work, to which <hi>the Lord hath called you,</hi> and never <hi>ſuffer as Buſy-Bodies in other Men's Matters.</hi> Permit me, my <hi>dear Friends</hi> and Brethren, to urge and <hi>beſeech you by the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of Chriſt's Mercy,</hi> to ſecure the Knowlege of God, and ſee that you are united to the Lord Jeſus by a living Faith, and that you are fruitful in all good Works. In your Places labour for a general Reformation; return to God yourſelves by unfeigned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; amend what you find amiſs in yourſelves, and in your Families. Study the Peace and Welfare of the Common-wealth; look upon the general Intereſt of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as your own private intereſt; and every one afford an helping Hand, for we need you. Honour your Superiors, and pray for all in Authority, pray for Goſpel Miniſters, and pray for yourſelves: For without the divine Bleſſing all our Labour and Pains will be loſt. Yea, in a Word, let us all Rulers and Ruled, Miniſters and People, <hi>ſo walk as the Lord hath called us</hi>; let us <hi>do Juſtly, love Mercy and walk Humbly,</hi> continually looking and aiming at the publick Intereſt, in which we are greatly concerned. Let every one labour to excel in the Improvement of his own Gifts, in his own Calling, and be <hi>diligent in Buſineſs ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Lord. And the diligent Man ſhall
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:008888_0045_103090D46C788D50"/>ſtand before Kings, he ſshall not ſtand before mean Men.</hi> 
               <note n="§">Prov. 22.29.</note> And let us ſtand waiting for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Lord, that when he ſhall appear, we may be approved of him, and reign and rejoice with him, to the Praiſe of divine Grace, with Joy unſpeakable and full of Glory, world without end.
