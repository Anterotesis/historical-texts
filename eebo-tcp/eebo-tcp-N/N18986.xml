            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>EVERY Man who commits his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents to public Criticiſm, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Motive be Honor, Intereſt, or other Conſideration, will be ſuppoſed to hope for Public Patronage, or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe. But the Man who ſhall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily condeſcend to obtain Succeſs; who ſhall by debaſing himſelf, attempt to elevate or exalt another, deſerves not private Regard or Public Favor.</p>
            <p>The Author of the following Sheets, is ſtrongly impreſſed with theſe Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Altho' he feels as all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors muſt do, who commit themſelves
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:024705_0003_0FC82CF7C4262A10"/>to the World: Altho' he knows many great and reſpectable Men, whoſe Friendſhip would pleaſe him, and whoſe Patronage would do him Honor; he prefers to obtain their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation to his Labors, as the volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Eſſuſions of their own Hearts, than as the Tribute to his Flattery or Solicitation. Thus thinking, none will blame, thus acting, all will applaud, who are admirers of the native Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendancy, which is the Birth-right of Man.—</p>
            <p>Inaccuracies will, in this Work, probably obtain, but let the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der reflect, that it is the genuine Offspring of poſitive Obſervation, taken ſometimes on Horſeback, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on a Stump, but always in Haſte, amidſt the <hi>Hurly Burly</hi> of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>informed and generally Indian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions.</p>

            <p>ON the firſt Day of <hi>June,</hi> 1790, I took my Departure from the City of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> with an Intention of viſiting the Weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern Regions of <hi>Kentuckey,</hi> and exploring the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Dominions of <hi>Louiſiana</hi> and the two <hi>Floridas;</hi> as alſo the Territories of the <hi>Creek</hi> Nation, now under the Governance of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander M'Gillivray,</hi>

            <p>Some Years ſince, the Aſſembly of Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia voted a Premium to Mr. <hi>John Hobdy,</hi> for his Invention of a Machine, which he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their Inſpection, well calculated for the Purpoſes of beating out Wheat and other ſmall Grain. Col. <hi>William</hi> hath improved upon <hi>Hobdy</hi>'s Invention by conſtructing a Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Mill, which without the Aid of animal Exertion, ſhatters out and prepares more ſmall Grain of any Kind in one Day, than <hi>Hobdy</hi>'s can in one Week. With this Mill alone, he ſpeedily prepares his Flax and Hemp for Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket or the Diſtaff. It is a Model well worth the Attention of every opulent Farmer, or of thoſe who raiſe large Crops of Flax and Hemp.</p>

Suffice it to ſay, that Mr. <hi>Thomas Fooley,</hi> of a very reputable Family in <hi>Maryland,</hi> is about ſix Feet three Inches high, and every Way diſproportionate in his Shape and contradictrory in the Lineaments of his Face, which at firſt View excited a Refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in the moſt ſerious Beholder. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities of his Conduct vie with thoſe of his Perſon. It was ſometime laſt Month that Mr. <hi>Fooley</hi> eloped from his Lady, under an Apprehenſion that ſhe was preparing through the Medium of her Friends an Inſtrument of Writing for him to ſign, whereby a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Part of his Fortune was to be veſted in the Hands of Truſtees, ſubject to her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul. To this Mr. <hi>Fooley</hi> was utterly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed—However, previous to his Elopement he left her an unlimited Power of Attorney, which he delivered into the Hands of his Overteer. At <hi>Redſtone</hi> he diſpoſed of his ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Horſe and Furniture for an old Braſs Watch, which has the Property of being

            <p>Mr. <hi>Breckenridge</hi> on his Way from <hi>Wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington</hi> Court. called in at Mr. <hi>Wolfe</hi>'s to have his Horſe fed and eſcape a Rain which was then deſcending.

A fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar Application was made to the old Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman for his Daughter, which he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as nothing more than Pleaſantry in Mr. <hi>Breckenridge,</hi> for which he is ſo remarkable. Mr. <hi>Breckenridge</hi> declared that he was ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that his Intentions were honourable, and that this future Happineſs reſted on the Event of his then Application. Miſs <hi>Sabina</hi> had been employed in Shrubbing the old Man's Meadow, which ſaved him the annual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of about ten Dollars.

As he had been a Fellow Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller in a ſtrange Land, I could not help re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrating with him upon the Impropriety of his Conduct, which, however he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to defend, by obſerving that his then Appearance was in Honour to the Memories of Mr. <hi>Sterne</hi> and Lord <hi>Verulam.</hi>—For Sir, added he, Mr. <hi>Sterne</hi> hath written expreſsly on the Subject of Jerkins in theſe Words, "A Man's Body and his Mird, with reverence I ſpeak
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:024705_0020_0FC82D200E0ABDE8"/>it, are exactly like a Jerkin and a Jerkin's Lining—Rumple the one, you Rumple the other:" And as to my Lord <hi>Verulam, "Smell-fungus</hi> in his Hiſtory of <hi>England</hi> repreſents his Lordſhip's Chappo, as ſimilar to what now covers the Noddle of your humble Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant."</p>
            <p>In the Neighbourhood of <hi>Louiſville</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued upwards of two Months; thoſe with whom I aſſociated, were affable and humane: The Stranger here may conſider himſelf as at Home—for ſuch is the extreme Hoſpitality of the People, that unknown to their Gueſt, they will confer, or rather impoſe Acts of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence, which cannot be refuſed without Rudeneſs.</p>

            <p n="15">15th. At Sunriſe eſpied the <hi>Frenchman</hi>'s Boat in good Harbour and uninjured; but different was the Fate of Mr. <hi>Craigs,</hi> which had ſprung a Leak in her Bow and appeared to be ſtranded oppoſite to the ſecond <hi>Chick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſaw</hi> Bluff, where the River is about Four Hundred Yards wide. At 9 o'Clock we viewed the third <hi>Chickeſaw</hi> Bluff, oppoſite to the <hi>Bayone St. John,</hi> where the River is not quite Four Hundred Yards wide. The Colours of this Bluff are white, red, yellow, blue, grey, black, brown, purple, &amp;c. Here the <hi>Chickaſaws</hi> once had a ſmall Pottery— Upon this Bluff is the moſt eligible Situation for a Town which I have as yet ſeen on the Banks of the <hi>Miſſiſippi.</hi>—Juſt under this Bluff, within ſix Feet of the Shore, a firſt Rate Man of War might ride in Safety, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſailed by Winds, &amp;c. At the upper End of this Bluff is an old Blockhouſe, built by a Captain <hi>Beſheare</hi>'s Company, who had the Convoy of military Stores for the <hi>Chickaſaws,</hi> which they depoſited therein, until they could procure the Aſſiſtance of additional and freſh Hands. From the lower End of this

            <p>
               <hi>March</hi> 18th. At Sunriſe came on a ſlight Snow, which formed a curious Contraſt to the Verdure of the Trees—All the Afternoon of this Day we run due North.</p>
            <p n="19">19th. At 8 o'Clock we run due South— All this Day the Weather was intenſely cold, the Wind blowing from North. About Noon ſix <hi>Indians</hi> of the <hi>Chactaw</hi> Nation came on Board and preſented us with two Strings of jerked Veniſon, for which we in Return gave

Twenty Miles up the <hi>Oſarque</hi> River are their Wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wams, oppoſite to which, on the Eaſtern Side, is a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Garriſon of Twenty-nine Men—
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:024705_0026_0FC82D3049D59FB8"/>The Place is high, well watered, and as yet the Garriſon have experienced no Sickneſs.</p>
            <p n="21">21ſt. At 8 o'Clock deſcried a Keel bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom'd Boat with a ſquare Sail, bound to <hi>New Madrid</hi>—Her Progreſs under a fair Wind was at the Rate of two and a half Miles per Hour, which might have been accelerated by the Addition of Oars. At ten o'Clock en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered a narrow Part of the <hi>Miſſiſippi,</hi> where it is not more than Two Hundred Yards wide. At 12 o'Clock diſcovered another Keel bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom'd Boat, deſtined to the ſame Place with the former. At Sunſet, three of Mr. <hi>Craig</hi>'s Tobacco Boats came up with us whilſt we lay in Harbour, the fourth being ſtill under the Command of the Rear Admiral, whoſe Intrepidity hath often endangered his Veſſel by oppoſing the poor <hi>Planters</hi> and <hi>Sawyers,</hi> who have taken up their Reſidence in this ſpacious River. It is ſhrewdly ſuſpected that the Rear Admiral will be tried by a Board of <hi>Dons,</hi> ſo ſoon as he makes the Port of <hi>Natchez.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="22">22d. At Sunriſe, eſpied a Veſſel of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Wilkinſon</hi>'s, under the Command of Captain <hi>Swaine,</hi> bound to <hi>New Orleans</hi>—At 8 o'Clock we had in View ſix Sail of the Line.</p>

               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:024705_0027_0FC82D31AC922FD0"/>23d. At 12 o'Clock we ran North Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly—Here the <hi>Miſſiſippi</hi> forms on the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Side an exact Reſemblance of an Horſe Shoe.</p>
            <p n="24">24th. At Break of Day eſpied the Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut Hills about ten Miles below the <hi>Yaſous</hi> River, which his Catholic Majeſty limits as his Boundary, and below which, his Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents ſay, that Citizens of the <hi>United States</hi> ſhall not inhabit, unleſs they throw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under the Laws, Banners and Protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> At 10 o'Clock eſpied a Shingle rooſed Houſe, occupied by a Family of <hi>New-Yorkers</hi>—Near this Spot the Governor of the <hi>Natchez</hi> hath fixed upon an Eminence for the Erection of a Fort. The Family informed, that the intended Garriſon were at the <hi>Natchez,</hi> taking in military Stores and Proviſion. The River oppoſite to the intended Fort is about Six hundred Yards wide. Whoever undertakes a Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription of the <hi>Walnut</hi> Hills, muſt have a fertile Imagination, be happy at Landſcape Painting, and uſe Something like Romance, or he will fall infinitely ſhort of that Eulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium which the Place ſo juſtly merits.</p>
            <p n="23">23d. At Sunriſe, ſaw two ſmall Houſes on the Eaſtern Side of the River upon a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful

Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been brought up at the Court of <hi>London,</hi> he is well acquainted with the Etiquette of Mortals who move in the more exalted and ſplendid Scenes of Life, He had in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with him two Victualling Boats and an armed Schooner, laden with military Stores. I could not aſcertain their Deſtination, tho' it was probably to the <hi>Walnut</hi> Hills. His Soldiery including Mariners and Mechanics, did not exceed one Hundred Men. Doctor <hi>O'Fallan,</hi> Agent for the <hi>Yajous</hi> Company, ardently pants for the Cultivation of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Soil; but by Connoiſeurs, it is ſhrewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conjectured, that having pitched his Tent in the Grotto of Miſs <hi>Clarke,</hi> his Ardency, like his Conſtitution, will turn into down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Frigidity.</p>
            <p n="24">24th. At Sunriſe, we ſhot the Grand Gulph, oppoſite to which, on either Side,

the Cane grows to the enormous Height of Forty and ſometimes Forty-five Feet. At 8 o'Clock an impervious Fog aroſe, ſo as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a Diſcovery of <hi>Sawyers</hi> and other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles not more than ten Feet from us. It might with Propriety have been called "Darkneſs viſible." At 9 o'Clock paſſed the <hi>Bayone Pierre,</hi> on the Banks of which are three ſmall Houſes and about Thirty Acres of Ground under Cultivation—About ten Miles higher up the Country it is pretty thickly inhabited by <hi>Virginians, Carolineans, Georgians,</hi> and ſome few Stragglers from the Eaſtern States.</p>
            <p n="26">26th. At Sunriſe came in Sight of the Town of <hi>Natchez,</hi> ſituate on the Eaſtern Bank of the River. It contains about an Hundred Houſes, and is the Metropolis of the Diſtrict and Reſidence of <hi>Don Gayoſo,</hi> the Governor laſt mentioned. In this Town and its Vicinage we continued about a Week.</p>
            <p n="27">27th. On <hi>Sunday</hi> I took a View of the Governor's Palace, as alſo of the Fort; which from its elevated Situation has a fine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the River for about a Mile up, and double that Diſtance down it: though I think it might be aſſailed with Succeſs by a
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:024705_0030_0FC82D3933B628C0"/>ſingle Regiment, or taken by Surprize with a leſs Number. The lying of the back Ground, and the Paucity and Inſignificance of the Garriſon would favour either Plan. They have a good Train of Artillery, though very injudiciouſly arranged; the back Part of the Fort being <hi>pregnable</hi> to a Dozen Men.</p>

Here I was regaled with different Kinds of Fruits, Wines and Parmeſan Cheeſe, which were ſucceedent to a very good ſubſtantial Dinner. Hoſpitality and Urbanity preſided at his Board: His Lady is young, handſome and polite—His Viſitants conſiſted of five reputable Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and three Ladies. One of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſpoke the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Languages with great Propriety and Faſe.

His Boatſmen (for whom he now no longer had Occaſion) appeared to bear his Loſs with great Compoſure and Chriſtian Fortitude. At 1 o'Clock moved from the <hi>Natchez,</hi> and in two Hours viewed the white Bluff on the Eaſtern Side of the River. This Situation is Romantic and boaſts a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Seat, near which lay three large To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco Boats unlaunched. Mr. <hi>Ellis,</hi> from <hi>Amelia</hi> County, of <hi>Virginia,</hi> reſides at this Place. Here I diſcovered the firſt Pine Trees ſince I croſſed the <hi>Allegheny</hi> Mountains.</p>
            <p n="31">31st. At 12 o'Clock paſt <hi>Leſtus</hi>'s Bluff, where the River is about Two Hundred Yards wide. This Situation is beauteous, and has two Plantations on the ſummit laid off in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:024705_0034_0FC82D4123BE3520"/>Squares, and a little Way below, a fine extenſive Meadow. At 3 o'Clock hailed by a Row Galley from <hi>New Orleans,</hi> bound to <hi>New Madrid,</hi> At 4 o'Clock eſpied the Long Reach, where the Eye may take in an unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted Water Proſpect of Twenty-three Miles. At our Entrance into the Long Reach we viewed the Red River, about a Quarter of a Mile wide, on the Weſtern Side of the <hi>Miſſiſippi;</hi> and three Miles below it the <hi>Bayoue Chappaliere,</hi> which taking its Leave of this River, diſembogues its gentle Stream into the Gulph of <hi>Mexico,</hi> ſeveral Leagues from the Mouths of the <hi>Miſſiſippi.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>April</hi> 1ſt. At Sunriſe we heard the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville beaten on the Weſtern Side of the River, where there is a ſmall <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Garriſon.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. Hailed by two Perochs, one bound to the <hi>Natchez,</hi> the other to the <hi>Bayoue Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erre.</hi> For two Days paſt we have been much harraſſed by <hi>Muſquettoes</hi>—The poor <hi>Indians</hi> who go almoſt naked, conſtruct an elevated Bed of Reeds, which they Suffumigate, ſo as to baniſh Inſects of every Deſcription from their Lodgements. Slight whitewaſhed airy Buildings become more common on the Eaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern Side of the River, and are, in general, occupied by People from the <hi>United States.</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:024705_0035_0FC82D43CC5EF248"/>Here are the moſt delightful Proſpects that ever caught my View—On the Weſtern Side there is a Meadow three Miles in Length and Half a Mile in Width, beſet with <hi>Engliſh</hi> Clover about eighteen Inches high, which depaſtures about Three Hundred Head of Horſes, and an equal Number of horned Cattle.</p>
            <p n="3">3d. At 10 o'Clock viewed <hi>Point Couper,</hi> a Village Twenty-one Miles in Length, though narrow, conſiſting of inferiour Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, interſperſed now and then with dwelling Houſes, and Chapels of tolerable Elegance. At 4 o'Clock ſaw eight Country Seats on the Eaſtern Bank, and at the lower End of ſome high Bluffs, a large Building of extraordinary Workmanſhip, and a Dock-yard about Haſt a Mile below it. At 6 o'Clock viewed the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Bluffs, from which on both Sides of the River there is a Continuation of beauteous Farms and elegant Buildings for the Diſtance of Sixty-one Miles. The general Width of the River all this Day is about three Quarters of a Mile, or rather leſs.</p>
            <p n="4">4th. About Noon eſpied the Suburbs of <hi>New Orleans,</hi> and at 2 o'Clock came abreaſt of the City on the Eaſtern Side of the River, in an Iſland formed by the <hi>Miſſiſippi</hi> and the
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:024705_0036_0FC82D44D460F310"/>
               <hi>Bayoue St. John.</hi> This City is the Reſidence of <hi>Don Miro</hi> a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Viceroy, and Empo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium of <hi>Louiſiana</hi> and the <hi>Indian</hi> Territories dependent thereon—It lies in almoſt an exact Square. The Streets which are wide, and ſome of them well paved with Brick, interſect each other at right Angles. The public Buildings are capacious and elegant. The private Houſes generally neat and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious. Both Deſcriptions lie compact and cover a Space of Ground of rather more than Half a Mile ſquare. As the Situation of <hi>New Orleans</hi> was originally Nothing more than an extenſive Moraſs, and ſubject to the Inundation of the <hi>Miſſiſippi,</hi> it became ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to exclude the Water, by conſtructing Dikes from about ten to fifteen Feet in Height, and double that Meaſure in Width The ſteady Exertions of many Hands were, and ſtill are employed in the Buſineſs; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which, the Dikes are ſometimes broken through, and conſiderable Damage ſuſtained by the Influx of Water into their Cellars, Gardens and lower Rooms.</p>
            <p>Along a ſpacious Canal from the <hi>Bayoue St. John,</hi> to the Weſtern Entrance of the City, both Fiſh and Fowl of every Kind in great Abundance are brought to their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket;

               <hi>April</hi> 7th. The <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>Louiſiana,</hi> are ſtrict <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> and therefore, enthuſiaſtically fond of Pageantry in their religious Feſtivals. This I can avouch from a Proceſſion of Yeſterday, when a crucified Redeemer was crucified afreſh, in being repreſented like a Felon, in the Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liment of a <hi>Jeſuit.</hi> The Virgin-Mother was dreſs'd out <hi>a-la-mode de Paris;</hi> and Traitor <hi>Judas,</hi> for political Reaſons, appeared in the Regimental Uniform of a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Soldier, under Sentence of Death, for having divul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Counterſign to the Enemy in Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of a <hi>Bribe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Proceſſion, I obſerved a young <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuckean</hi> who had been educated in all the Strictneſs of Preſbyterianiſm, from which he had apoſtatized, and embraced Anabaptiſm and Methodiſm, which he highly honoured, by uſing each Profeſſion alternately, as Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy might ſuggeſt. He was preſented with a waxen Candle, which he devotionally received; and, like the Knight of the woeful Countenance, joined the cheating and the cheated Throng.</p>

               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:024705_0038_0FC82D47D334FE00"/>On the Morning of the Proceſſion, I planted myſelf near the Door of the Monaſtry, and had a faint Glimpſe of the <hi>Nuns</hi> whilſt thus were adjuſting their Capuchins. The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery is near the Centre of the Town, and remarkable only for its Length, which if I miſtake not, is about Two Hundred Feet. The Hoſpital is ſituate in the Weſtern Edge of the City, where Nothing interrupts its Ventilation from the Eaſt, South and North; but unfortunately, as if intended to baniſh Chearfulneſs from its Manſions, the Prieſts have laid off a Burial Ground, which is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed on one Side by the Front Wall of the Building.

            <p>Private Adventurers from <hi>New-York Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia</hi> and <hi>Baltimore,</hi> carry on a tolerable Trade at this Place—They have an Advance of Cent per Cent on their Goods, which are nevertheleſs cheaper than <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

The Tail part of this Animal yields a very nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritious Food, and on which, the <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Negroes</hi> voraciouſly englut and gormandize.

This Gentleman to Appearance is at leaſt Five and Forty, tho' in Fact only Thirty-two Years of Age—Diſſipation marked his juvinile Days, and ſapped a Conſtitution originally delicate and feeble.—He is ſubject to an habitual Head-Ach and Cholic, notwithſtanding which his Temper is placid and ſerene, and at In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals of Eaſe quite joyous. He poſſeſſes an Atticiſm of Diction aided by a liberal Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a great Fund of Wit and Humour, meliorated by perfect good Nature and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs.—His Lady conſidering the Mode of Education to which ſhe was ſubjected in the early Part of Life, is a Model of Prudence and Diſcretion; and could her Complexion, which is <hi>olive,</hi> be commuted for the lovely Tints of <hi>red</hi> and <hi>white,</hi> ſhe would be</p>

            <p>He has a conſiderable Number of Negroes at his different Plantations, probably more than Fifty, and common Report ſays, double that Number in the Spaniſh West-India iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands; as alſo large Stocks of Horſes, Hogs, and horned Cattle. Two or three White Men ſuperintend their reſpective Ranges, and now and then collect them together in Order to brand, mark, &amp;c: This they effect by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them a little Salt in their Incloſures. His Table ſmokes with good ſubſtantial Diet, and his Side-board diſplays a Variety of Wines and ardent Spirits.—The General encourages his People in all Kinds of gymnaſtic Exerciſes; his Motives for which may be eaſily conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured — He invited me to a Ball-Match, about 10 miles from his Houſe, between two Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips. Sixty-two alert young Fellows were ſelected from each Town. The Goals were ſet up about a Quarter of a Mile apart, near the Center of an extenſive Campaign or Praire.— They conſiſt of two blazed Saplings fixed in the Ground about 10 Feet aſunder at either End, thro' which every Time either Party throws the Ball with their Rackets, they are
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:024705_0049_0FC82D64D2293350"/>entitled to count one—The Number of the Game is arbitrary.—Midway between the Goals, the Ball is thrown up alternately by two old Men, who are mutually choſen by the contending Parties to decide, all Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies which may ariſe in the Courſe of the Game—Upon throwing up the Ball a violent Struggle enſues between the Parties which ſometimes laſts 8 or 10 Minutes, before either Side can give it a caſt; and when they do, there are others of their Opponents ready to intercept and give it an adverſe Direction.— On this Game Property to a very conſiderable Amount is generally riſqued, conſiſting of Broaches, Bracelets, Gorgets, Medals, Paints, Arms and Ammunition piled up in a pyrami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Form. Sometimes their whole Family Stock of Food and Raiment is hazzarded.— A diſlocated Joint or fractured Bone is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common: Suffer what they may, you'll never ſee an angry Look or hear a threatening Word among them.</p>

            <p>Having ſpent an agreeable Time among the upper <hi>Creeks,</hi> I took my Departure on the General's Horſe, with his Overſeer as an Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cort to the Lower Towns of <hi>Coweto, Broken-Arrow</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="unknown:024705_0052_0FC82D6ADA122220"/>and <hi>Cuſſatee.</hi> The two former lie on the Weſtern, and the latter on the Eaſtern Side of the <hi>Chattahoutchee</hi> River, which takes its Name from two <hi>Indian</hi> Words; <hi>Chatta,</hi> a Stone, and <hi>Houtchee,</hi> which ſignifies marked or inſcribed. This Stone lies about 3 Miles above the <hi>Coweta,</hi> at the Rapids, covered over with hieroglyphic Inſcriptions, which the preſent Race do not underſtand. On the Weſtern Side of the River, upon the low Grounds of the <hi>Cuſſatees</hi> is a Mount, on whoſe Summit are the evident Traces of a Parapet ſufficiently large to have contained one Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men. This Mount appears to have been the Work of Ages and of many Hands, being upwards of 600 Yards in Circumferrence at its Baſe, and about 100 Feet in perpendicular Height. On the Weſtern Side and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately oppoſite to the Mount, are the Veſtiges of a very large and deep Intrenchment, thrown up in a circular Form by the Anceſtors of the preſent Race, as a Defence againſt a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Tribe of the <hi>Seminolies,</hi> whom the <hi>Creeks</hi> after a long and bloody Conteſt of 20 Years, extirminated, and re-peopled the deſerted Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="54" facs="unknown:024705_0053_0FC82D6BF18E6AA8"/>a Giant-King of moſt ſtupendous Size, called <hi>Billy Pig,</hi> who in Times of <hi>Dearth,</hi> would ſtop the <hi>Chattahoutchee</hi> with his Foot, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Current over all the neighbouring Fields: That the <hi>Alligators</hi> got offended at his Conduct, and begged their King to ſnap off his great Toe; the Loſs of which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented him from damming up the Water any more with that Foot; and ſo he died of Grief, and was burried under the circular Mount al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned, coil'd uplike a Rattle-Snake.</p>
            <p>During my Tarriance at the lower Towns, I formed an Intimacy with the <hi>Little King</hi> of the <hi>Broken Arrow,</hi> who is friendly, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicative and intelligent. Through him, with the Aid of an Interpreter, I attempted to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a ſmall Vocabulary of the <hi>Creekiſh</hi> Tongue, particularly of ſuch Words as moſt frequently occur in common Intercourſe. In the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of this, I enquired of him what Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation he had for God? he replied, <hi>Sawgee Putchehaſſee,</hi> which ſignifies the Giver and Taker of Breath: And pray with what Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thet is your Majeſty pleaſed to honor the poor old Devil? with Emotions of Contempt he replied; there is no Devil: God Almighty is too much of a Gentleman to keep bad Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants about him. Juſt at this Inſtant, his Majeſty received an Invitation to a Rum-Drinking,
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:024705_0054_0FC82D6E10DC6800"/>which in Oppoſition to all my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions, he reſolved to honour with his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. This Rum-Drinking or Spewing-Match was held in the public Square, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous to their Hot-Houſe; in one or other of which Places, as the Seaſon may require, the <hi>Wittenagemote</hi> of the Diſtrict aſſemble for the Diſcuſſion of all Subjects, whether civil or military, moral or divine. Here alſo they hold their War Dances, diſplay their Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies of War, and keep their annual Feſtival called the <hi>Buſk.</hi> This Feſtival generally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mences about the middle of <hi>July,</hi> upon the firſt Diſcovery of ripen'd Corn, and is the grand Epocha of the <hi>Creeks.</hi> All the Male Claſs who have attained the Age of Puberty, religiouſly abſtain from all Intercourſe with the other Sex, and every Kind of Suſtenance, except Water, for three Days; which from the Catharties and Emeties they then ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, are called the Days of Purgation. Thus cleanſed from the Impurities of the former Year, they extinguiſh every Particle of Fire throughout their Diſtrict, and rekindle more by the Friction of a round <hi>Saſſafras</hi> Stick, in an Augur Hole bored into a Piece of dry <hi>Poplar.</hi> This Relighting of the Fire, is performed by their Chief Prieſt or <hi>Sachim,</hi> and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by Torches to the Maſter or Miſtreſs
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:024705_0055_0FC82D722770E4B0"/>of each reſpective Family. This done, a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifidous Meſs of new Corn, cooked over the new Fire, is brought into the Centre of the Square, and diſtributed with great Formality among the Gueſts, agreeable to Seniority and Rank, by old Men and Women deputed for that Purpoſe. When the Repaſt is over, they riſe up with one Conſent, and with many ſtrange Geſticulations and loud Shouts of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Triumph, dance down the Sun, Moon, and Seven Stars. At the Cloſe of almoſt every Day throughout the Year, about 15 or 20 principal Townſmen aſſemble in the Square, for the Purpoſe of giving or receiving the moſt recent Intelligence, whether foreign or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic, which if important, is reported to their grand Council, and by them to the National Aſſembly, whoſe Decrees on the Occaſion, are generally ratified by their Emperor, who has Power alſo of rejecting them.—The <hi>Creeks</hi> conſider Fornication as a <hi>Faux Pas</hi> or venial Crime at moſt: but Wo! to the Sons and Daughters who commit Adultry: Vengeance in a ſwift Career purſues them and cannot be appeaſed, but by the corporeal Sufferance of the Aggreſſors.

This pious Tribute to their Dead includes Horſes, Cows, Hogs and Dogs, as well as Things inanimate. A Girl of about 16 Years of Age died a few Days before I left the Nation. She had procured from a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Officer at <hi>Penſacola,</hi> a likely Boar-Pig of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Breed, which ſhe brought Home, and cheriſhed in her Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, until he waxed ſtrong, and became an uſeful Member in his Generation. Now when her Brethren, and the young Men of the Land, perceived that the Damſel was dead; they aroſe up and purſued after the Boar and ſlew him. And a certain young Man of the Houſe of <hi>Illeſenekaw</hi> ſtood up in the Midſt of the Congregation, and ſaid; I will go unto my Lord the King and unto the Elders and Chief Men of the Land, and ſay unto the Verily

And they ſaid unto him Go: And he departed and went unto the King, and unto the Elders and Chief Men of the Land, and reported all theſe Things; ſaying, Verily the Big Boar of <hi>Chattaboutchee</hi> is ſlain, by the Arrows of the Sons of <hi>Ninewaw</hi> is he fallen. And when the King and the Elders and Chief Men heared thereof, they drank ſtrong Drink and grew exceeding Wroth, ſaying; the Blood of the Boar be upon the Head of thoſe, who have wrought this Evil in <hi>Coweta;</hi> for they wiſt not that the Damſel was dead —This extraordinary Circumſtance extorted from me an Epitaph on the Damſel and the Boar, who are now Jointenants of one Grave.</p>

<pb n="63" facs="unknown:024705_0062_0FC82D811BD8E030"/>which produce as many earleſs Stalks, and which they will upon no Conſideration ſuffer to be thin'd. They ſay a plough is nothing but a Horſe-trap, and therefore never uſe it, contenting themſelves with light Weeding Hoes, with which they barely ſcalp the graſſy Surface of their Fields. Their Incloſures are Fork and Rail Fences juſt high enough to keep out horned Cattle. Whilſt their Crops are in the Ground they tether out their Horſes, Hogs &amp;c, to Trees, Stumps and Stakes.

Late in the Evening we arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at an old deſerted <hi>Indian</hi> Village, ſituate on the Banks of <hi>Flint</hi> River, near an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Miles from <hi>Chattahoutchee,</hi> with which it unites, and empties into the Ocean 50 Miles South of <hi>St. Marks.</hi>—About 30 Families from the <hi>Chattahoutchee</hi> Townſhips are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettling this Place. The late Rains had forced the River out of its Banks and rendered
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:024705_0067_0FC82D8C2854AD30"/>it impaſſable to Mr. <hi>Turvin</hi>'s Horſes which Were loaded with Beaver-Skins. In this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity two young Fellows very opportunely came up and proffered their Aſſiſtance in the Conſtruction of a Raft, compoſed of the Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers from the old Village Houſes.—When we had croſſed the Stream, they propoſed going with us as far as the foederal Fort on the <hi>Oconee,</hi> to which we readily aſſented, and found them very tractable in rendering every poſſible Aid in ſimilar Predicaments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 2 Encamped on the Banks of <hi>Ock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulga</hi> about 30 Miles from <hi>Flint.</hi> Here alſo we had Recourſe to our <hi>India</hi> Friends for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Raft as well as a Shelter from a moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Rain which was then deſcending. They ſoon conſtructed both; the former with dry Logs, the latter with the Bark of Pines— <hi>Ockmulga</hi> unites with the <hi>Oconee,</hi> and forms the <hi>Alatamaha</hi> which empties into the Sea North of <hi>St. Mary</hi>'s River, and is navigable for Veſſels of 40 or 50 Tons Burthen 300 Miles from its Mouth. Late in the Evening arrived at, and continued on the Banks of the <hi>Oconee,</hi> which was impaſſible for two Days.—Here our Proviſſions were exhauſted, and <hi>Turvin</hi> and myſelf appeared like Men without Hope, having left all our Ammunition on the South Bank of the <hi>Ockmulga</hi> at our laſt Encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:024705_0068_0FC82D8D98D4A8B0"/>We communicated our Diſtreſs and Misfortune to our <hi>Indian</hi> Friends. They ſmiled at our Perplexity, and without inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us of their Intentions, immediately took different Routes, and in about 3 Hours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, one with an <hi>Opoſſum,</hi> the other with about a Peck of Turtle Eggs, on which we fared ſumptiouſly during our two Days Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> — Early in the Morning we diveſted ourſelves of all our Cloathing, and confined it on the Tops of the Beaver Packs; then each Man with one end of a long Rope tied round his Horſe's Neck, and holding the other in his left Hand, plunged into the Stream and ſwam to the oppoſite Shore. In this hazardous and voluntary Attempt we in ſome Meaſure imitated what Caeſar did through Accident and Love of Fame, when caſt away. Thus hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing braved <hi>Oconee</hi>'s rough, rocky, rapid Stream which was then upwards of 200 Yards in Width, we reſumed our Dreſs, mounted our Nags, and in 2 Hour's Time reached the Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral Fort on the Eaſtern Bank of the River, about 10 Miles below the Place where we croſſed, and 2 Miles below the Rock Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. At the Fort I continued 4 Days; being invited by Major <hi>Call,</hi> Capt. <hi>Rudolph,</hi> Lieut. <hi>Martin</hi> and Enſign <hi>Clay</hi> to ſpend the Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:024705_0069_0FC82D90255EDD30"/>of American Independence with them. The Rejoicings of the Day were uſhered in by the Diſcharge of Muſketry and Cannon under the Direction of ſkillful Officers in each Department, at whoſe Expenſe a genteel Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was provided under a ſpacious Booth; to the Participation of which, Ladies and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen from the Country were invited. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſentimental Toaſts ſuitable to the Celi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brity of the Day were drank, and at 6 o'Clock the Company repaired to a large Room in Town and partook of an excellent Supper, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which, with the Introduction of Minuets, Cotillions and Country Dances, the Evening was cloſed to the entire ſatisfaction of all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. On this Occaſion Major <hi>Call</hi> with his uſual Politeneſs invited my two <hi>Indian</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, who expreſſed a ſtrong Deſire to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt into our ſervice, in which they concluded that a Man might wear fine Cloaths and fare ſumptuouſly every Day. The Town lies about half a Mile below the Fort, and the Buildings at both Places, conſiſt of very rough, ſlight Materials, as if intended merely to anſwer a temporary Shelter for a few Sojourners The Citizens however like other Southern People, are indolent, luxurious, fond of gaudy Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel and pompous Equ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>July</hi>—.Took our leave of this Place at about 10 o'Clock, and by 4 in the Evening arrived at, and paſſed through <hi>Waſhington,</hi> a ſmall Townſhip ſituate on the South Side of <hi>Oguechee</hi> River, at the upper End of the Falls, and moved on to another little Town about a Mile below it on the North Side, at the mouth of the Falls. I had only a tranſient View of theſe little Towns, which appeared to have been very lately erected; a Deſcription there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be expected. At Sunſet, encamped about half a Mile from the Road, convenient to a Spring, on whoſe little Stream, our Horſes met with moſt delightful tender vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Cane. Here I undertook to teach <hi>Turvin</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi>'s Prayer, which he ſoon learned,

having, as he ſaid, had ſome little Smattering of it before he went to the <hi>Creek</hi> Nation and married a damn'd Heathen.—After a ſhort Repoſe in order to avoid the ſultry Heat of Noon, we aroſe, collected our Horſes, and purſued our Journey till 10 o'Clock the next Day, when we halted and refreſhed ourſelves and Nags till 3. At 5 o'Clock we paſſed the Battle Ground where <hi>Turvin</hi> had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated by the <hi>Creeks,</hi> previous to our War with <hi>Britain.</hi> The Recollection of former Diſaſters rendered him ſomewhat phlegmatic; but when at 6 we came in Sight of the Houſe in which he had been born and raiſed to Man's Eſtate, and from which he had been driven</p>

I will here tranſcribe the Sentiments of a modern Author upon the Subject of Duelling, which he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, has in many Countries a Law againſt it—but can never be prevented. The Law can inflict no greater Penalty for any Breach of it than Death; which the Duelliſt contemns—There are alſo ſome Caſes of Injury which the Law cannot prevent, nor puniſh when commiſted. Theſe muſt be redreſſed by the Man who ſuffers, and by him ONLY. He is prompted to do this by ſomething antecedent, and ſuperior to all Law, and by a Deſire as eager as Hunger or Luſt; ſo that it is as eaſy for Law to prevent or reſtrain the two latter, as the former. Very luckily for us Occaſions for the Gratification of this Paſſion occur but ſeldom: and though a Man may be reſtrained from a Duel by perſonal Fear, which is its only Counteractor, there are very few In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, perhaps none of its being prevented by conſidering it as a Breach of Law. In the Beginning of the laſt Century Duels were ſo frequent, particularly in <hi>France,</hi> as to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion a ſevere Edict to prevent them—Indeed by their Frequency, they were by Degrees im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved into Combats of 2, 3, and ſometimes more of a Side—In thoſe Days a French No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman was making up his Party to decide a

Quarrel with another Man of equal Rank; it came to the Ears of the King, who ſent to him one of the moſt riſing Men at Court, with a Command to deſiſt, aſſuring him of the ſtrict Execution of the Edict in Caſe of Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence—Every one knows the Attachment of the <hi>French</hi> to their Soverign, but yet it proved weak when ſet againſt this all-powerful Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The Nobleman not only refuſed to obey the King, but actually engaged the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger to be one of his Party.—The above ſeem to be the principal Reaſons why Duel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling has ſo deep a Root in the Mind of Man —but there are others which come in Aid.

He had been detained by Sickneſs. On the ſecond Day of our Paſſage, being as yet in a State of Convaleſcence, he expreſſed in his Words and Actions a fixed Melancholy, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to a State of Deſperation. 'Twas about 2 o'Clock in the Morning, when Mr. <hi>Foote,</hi> to court the cooling Breeze, had ſeated himſelf upon the Quarter Deck and received an accidental Stroke from the Tiller on his Head.—He roſe up and exclaimed, <hi>My God, My God, I cannot bear it all!</hi> and quickly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared.—I ſincerely regret, that when I ſaw him melancholy and deſpondent, I had not ſpoken to him—I might probably have ſaid Something to him, or done Something for him, that might have ſooth'd the Anguiſh of his Soul, and by exciting Hope, have chaſed the gloomy Daemon from his Breaſt, and cauſed the poor deſpairing Mortal yet to live. This Voyage is uſually performed in about 4 Days, though through the Inadvertency, or Ignorance of the Captain, we made it ſeven, having over-ran our Reckoning, and inſtead of <hi>St. Mary</hi>'s ſailed a conſiderable Diſtance up the <hi>St. John</hi>'s River in <hi>Eaſt-Florida;</hi> when to our great Aſtoniſhment we were hailed by a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Officer, who authoritatively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of us, if we knew where we were?

We thanked the Officer, inſtantly put about, and in 5 Hours reached the Mouth of <hi>St. Mary</hi>'s, caſt Anchor, and waited the Approach of a Pilot.—On our Entrance into this fine River, I obſerved the Remains of an old Fort, compoſed of <hi>Portland</hi> Stone, <hi>Liverpool</hi> Brick, and ſtrong Cement, which, from its Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to the Sun and Wind, hath acquired a greater Durability than either the Brick or Stone.

            <p>Diſappointed in having our Frieght of Live Oak in Readineſs, we had much Leiſure on our Hands, which Capt <hi>Robertſon</hi> and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to appropriate to the Exploration of ſeveral Parts of <hi>Eaſt-Florida</hi>—For this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe we chartered a ſmall keel bottomed Boat, and taking four Oars-men with us, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed along the inland Navigation, which leads directly to the Neighbourhood of <hi>St. Auguſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> which however we were not permitted to enter, and received repeated Intimations, that a ſpeedy Return to <hi>St. Mary</hi>'s would ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue the Height of <hi>Prudence</hi> in us, with which the Captain and I were by no means chargeable: For we had concerted no Plan or plauſible Excuſe by which we might elude the Vigilance or Jealouſy of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Guarda Coſtas. <hi>Robertſon</hi> carried in his Pocket, a Pencil and a ſmall Book, in which he had made ſome rough Sketches of <hi>Charleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> and <hi>St. Mary</hi>'s.
