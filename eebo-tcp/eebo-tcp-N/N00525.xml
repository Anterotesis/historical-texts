            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>RULES
For the Society of
NEGROES. 1693.</head>
            <p>WE the Miserable Children of <hi>Adam,</hi> and of <hi>Noah,</hi> thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
Admiring and Accepting the Free-Grace of GOD,
that Offers to Save us from our Miseries, by the Lord Jesus
Christ, freely Resolve, with His Help, to become the
Servants of that Glorious LORD.</p>
            <p>And that we may be Assisted in the Service of our <hi>Heavenly Master,</hi>
we now Join together in a SOCIETY, wherein the following RULES
are to be observed.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. It shall be our Endeavour, to Meet in the <hi>Evening</hi> after the <hi>Sabbath;</hi>
and <hi>Pray</hi> together by Turns, one to Begin, and another to Conclude
the Meeting; And between the two <hi>Prayers,</hi> a <hi>Psalm</hi> shall be Sung,
and a <hi>Sermon</hi> Repeated.</item>
               <item>II. Our coming to the Meeting, shall never be without the <hi>Leave</hi> of
such as have Power over us: And we will be Careful, that our
Meeting may Begin and Conclude between the Hours of <hi>Seven</hi> and
<hi>Nine;</hi> and that we may not be <hi>unseasonably Absent</hi> from the Families
whereto we pertain.</item>
               <item>III. As we will, with the Help of God, at all Times avoid all <hi>Wicked
Company,</hi> so we will Receive none into our Meeting, but such as
have sensibly <hi>Reformed</hi> their Lives from all manner of Wickedness.
And therefore, None shall be Admitted, without the Knowledge and
Consent of the <hi>Minister</hi> of God in this Place; unto whom we will
also carry every Person, that seeks for <hi>Admission</hi> among us; to be by
Him Examined, Instructed and Exhorted.</item>
               <item>IV. We will, as often as may be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Obtain some Wise and <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> of
the <hi>English</hi> in the Neighbourhood, and especially the Offcers of the
Church, to look in upon us, and by their Presence and Counsil, do
what they think fitting for us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </item>
               <item>V. If any of our Number, fall into the Sin of <hi>Drunkenness,</hi> or <hi>Swearing,</hi>
or <hi>Cursing,</hi> or <hi>Lying,</hi> or <hi>Stealing,</hi> or notorious <hi>Disobedience</hi> or <hi>Unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
unto their Masters, we will <hi>Admonish</hi> him of his Miscarriage, and
Forbid his coming to the Meeting, for at least <hi>one Fortnight;</hi> And ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
he then come with great Signs and Hopes of his <hi>Repentance,</hi> we
will utterly Exclude him, with Blotting his <hi>Name</hi> out of our List.</item>
               <item>VI. If any of our Society De<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>le himself with <hi>Fornication,</hi> we will give
him our <hi>Admonition;</hi> and so, debar him from the Meeting, at least <hi>half
a Year:</hi> Nor shall he Return to it, ever any more, without Exemplary
Testimonies of his becoming a <hi>New Creature.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>VII. We will, as we have Opportunity, set our selves to do all the Good
we can, to the other <hi>Negro-Servants</hi> in the Town; And if any of them
should, at unfit Hours, be <hi>Abroad,</hi> much more, if any of them should
<hi>Run away</hi> from their Masters, we will afford them <hi>no Shelter:</hi> But we
will do what in us lies, that they may be discovered, and punished.
And if any <hi>of us,</hi> are found Faulty, in his Matter, they shall be no
longer <hi>of us.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>VIII. None of our Society shall be <hi>Absent</hi> from our Meeting, without
giving a <hi>Reason</hi> of the Absence; And if it be found, that any have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
unto their <hi>Owners,</hi> that they came unto the <hi>Meeting,</hi> when they
were otherwise and elsewhere Employ'd, we will faithfully <hi>Inform</hi>
their Owners, and also do what we can to Reclaim such Person from
all such Evil Courses for the Future.</item>
               <item>IX. It shall be expected from every one in the Society, that he learn the
<hi>Catechism;</hi> And therefore, it shall be one of our usual Exercises, for
one of us, to ask the <hi>Questions,</hi> and for all the rest in their Order, to
say the <hi>Answers</hi> in the <hi>Catechism;</hi> Either, The <hi>New-English</hi> Catechism,
or the <hi>Assemblies</hi> Catechism, or the Catechism in the <hi>Negro Christianized.</hi>
