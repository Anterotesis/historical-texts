            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ORATION, &amp;c. FEBRUARY 22, 1800.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MY FELLOW CITIZENS,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WE are now aſſembled to review the life and to lament the Death, of the firſt of uninſpired Men. We have often met to celebrate our national Independence. We never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore aſſembled to weep over the memory of the man, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the auſpices of heaven eſtabliſhed us an Independent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The grateful tribute, which America this day pays her Waſhington will not be forgotten. It will be regiſtered in the annals of our country for the inſtruction of mankind, and remoteſt poſterity will read with mournful pleaſure and admiration our expreſſions of gratitude and grief. As the death of this great man is a national calamity, there is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in our national conduct. And ſince this day, ſixty eight years, introduced him into life, this day is fitly choſen, for the people to aſſemble in their reſpective cities and villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as a nation to recollect his virtues and bewail his death.</p>
            <p>WHEN great and good men fall, in proportion to their greatneſs and goodneſs is the public loſs, and in the ſame proportion ſhould be the public grief. If the character of Waſhington may be eſtimated by the effuſions of grief, which in the moment of general feeling have been poured forth to his memory, he was great and good. His memory ſhall live. It ſhall live, to ſtimulate others to live like him, and as a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute due to departed merit.</p>
            <p>WHEN Moſes died, the Children of Iſrael wept for him in the plains of moab thirty days. With equal juſtice may the inhabitants of this land weep for their beloved Waſhington. By his death every deſcription of citizens is called to mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſuch as are ſkillful in lamentation to wailing. And while freedom waves her banner over this happy land, all the ſinging men and ſinging women will ſpeak of him in their lamentations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:037493_0003_100D4636AE685B18"/>IF we ſearch the pages of ancient or modern times, in what age or country ſhall we find a character ſo univerſally belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and reſpected? Such is the reputation, which he acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and preſerved thro' life, that the man, who attempts to wound his fame, brings diſhonor upon himſelf. His eminent talents were conſecrated to the ſervice of his country. His exalted virtues gave him the firſt ſeat in the hearts of his Fellow Citizens. He lived and died the ornament of human nature, his country's pride and boaſt.</p>
            <p>Illuſtrious men have frequently riſen up, who have been eminently uſeful in their day. But they have generally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to the world a verſatility of character. Not ſo the illuſtrious Waſhington. However diverſified his lot, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited himſelf the ſame. In proſperity and adverſity he has been uniformly great and good.—Men of talents, devoid of principle, inſtead of being bleſſings to the world, generally prove ſcourges to mankind. The man, whoſe memory we now honor, was endowed with uncommon talents, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of virtuous principles. Theſe united have rendered him a rich bleſſing to his country; and while talents and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue are reſpected, he will command the eſteem, &amp; ſtand forth the admiration of the world.</p>
            <p>IN all the relations and characters, which he ſuſtained, he merits attention. Whether we view him in <hi>public</hi> or in <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate</hi> life, as a WARRIOR, a STATESMAN, or a CITIZEN, we love &amp; admire the man. The tranſactions of this day, my friends, will rather diminiſh, than add to his Glory. For as the fineſt pencil cannot paint like nature, ſo no portrait will be drawn of his character, which will juſtly repreſent him. Too low or too high coloring will mar every picture. The moſt ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſemblance will be the moſt beautiful.</p>
            <p>BUT however deficient we may be in taking the portrait of our Waſhington, we ſhall expreſs our gratitude for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and our admiration of his character. We ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit a Phaenomenon, new in the hiſtory of nations; a repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, which knows how to appreciate and reward the ſervices of her citizens.</p>
            <p>THE higheſt happineſs of Rome conſiſted in ſending into exile the men, who had rendered her the moſt ſignal ſervices. Ingratitude has hitherto been characteriſtic of republics. We ſhall reſcue them from this reproach. It is left to the eighteenth
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:037493_0004_100D4638AA54C2F0"/>
century, and to this weſtern world, properly to reſpect merit. America has never loſt ſight of the virtues, nor forgotten the good deeds of her Waſhington. And ſhe will this day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view his life with as much pleaſure, as the traveller repeats the ſtory of his travels, the ſeaman his adventures, and the warrior the battles he has won.</p>
            <p>GEORGE WASHINGTON was the 3'd ſon of Mr. AUGUSTINE WASHINGTON, a wealthy farmer of diſtinguiſhed reputation in Virginia. His anceſtors came from England about the year 1657. He was the firſt fruit of a ſecond marriage, and at the commencement of our Revolution had living three Brothers, and one ſiſter. Under a private tutor he was taught the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments of the Latin language, Engliſh Grammar, &amp; the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Mathematics. At the age of ten years he bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his Father. The morning of his days however did not paſs inactive, nor was it ſpent in vanity and vice. While a pure mountain air and the healthy occupations of rural life favoured the production of a large and well proportioned bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, his application to uſeful ſtudies tended to the formation of a correct and ſolid mind. Having laid the foundation of his eminence in its proper ſeaſon, he entered the theatre of life, peculiarly well calculated to act the noble part, which we have ſeen him exhibit. No man ever walked the ſtage to better advantage, or left it with greater applauſe.</p>
            <p>WITH what ſatisfaction may we take a view of him in the character of a CITIZEN? Virtuous ſimplicity adorned his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate life. In his family ſeat at Mount Vernon, we behold him exhibiting to his fellow citizens an example worthy of Imitation. He was the greateſt farmer of which his Country did boaſt. In 1776 his landed property was eſtimated at "more than a hundred and ſixty thouſand pounds ſterling." He raiſed in one year <q>ſeven thouſand buſhels of wheat, &amp; ten thouſand of Indian Corn.</q> The year following he raiſed <q>two hundred lambs, ſowed twenty ſeven buſhels of flax ſeed, &amp; planted more than ſeven hundred buſhels of potatoes. He had manufactured under his own eye, by his domeſtics, linen and woollen cloth ſufficient for his houſehold, which confuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of nearly a thouſand ſouls.</q> The ſtricteſt oeconomy and moſt exemplary method were eſtabliſhed in all his depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Reports were weekly received by him from his overſeers, and correctly regiſtered in his agricultural books: and at the end of every year, he was able accurately to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the labor and produce of his farm. Huſbandry was
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037493_0005_100D463A983CC1F8"/>
his delight, and as he cultivated his farm with pleaſure, ſo with equal pleaſure he <hi>contributed more</hi> than any <hi>Farmer</hi> in America to the ſupport of that Government, which confirmed him in the poſſeſſion, and ſecured to him the profits of his farm. The bleſſings of good Government he knew how to appreciate, and while he gloried in American Freedom, he yielded, as a ſubject, implicit obedience to his country's laws.</p>
            <p>IN domeſtic and ſocial life, he was a kind huſband, a gentle maſter, an unfailing friend, and a bountiful benefactor. <hi>When the ear heard</hi> him <hi>it bleſſed</hi> him, <hi>and when the eye ſaw</hi> him, <hi>it gave witneſs to</hi> him; for he <hi>delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherleſs, and him that had none to help him.</hi> In his intercourſe with his fellow men, the ſtricteſt honor &amp; integrity were ſtamped upon his conduct, and punctuality marked all his engagements. Kind and generous in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, <hi>the bleſſings</hi> of many <hi>ready to periſh came upon</hi> him, and he <hi>cauſed the widows heart to ſing for joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>REGULARITY, temperance &amp; induſtry were habits in which he lived. He generally roſe at the dawn of day and his uſual hour for retirement was nine in the evening. Every hour had aſſigned to it its proper employment: &amp; to his own &amp; his country's honor be it ſpoken, in theſe aſſignments religion had its place. Amidſt the multiplicity of his concerns he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered God. This is the brighteſt part of this great man's Character. Feeling his entire dependence, he daily, at ſtat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeaſons, paid his acknowledgements to his maker and ſought his bleſſing. With what pleaſure do we behold him expreſſing the morality of the goſpel in his life, and aſcribing, in his public, writings, <q>the meliorated condition of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and the encreaſed bleſſings of ſociety, <hi>to the</hi> PURE <hi>and benign light of</hi> REVELATION?</q> With what pleaſure do we behold him, offering up earneſt prayer to God, that he would diſpoſe us all, to exhibit in our lives thoſe virtues, <q>which were the characteriſtics of the DIVINE AUTHOR <hi>of our</hi> BLESSED RELIGION; <hi>without an humble imitation of whoſe example,</hi>
               </q> in this reſpect, <q>
                  <hi>we can never hope to be a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py nation?</hi>
               </q> He was punctual and devout in his attendance upon the inſtituted worſhip of Chriſt. He honored Gods Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths: &amp; may we not charitably hope, that God gave him in his houſe and within his walls, <hi>a place and a name, better than of ſons and of daughters?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LET us now turn and view him in PUBLIC LIFE. Here he

From the year 1759, when he reſigned his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, as Commander in chief of all the Virginia forces, which had been raiſed, to repel the French, who were endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to ſubjugate theſe colonies, and annex them to the Crown of France, he was conſtantly a member of aſſembly, till the year '74; when he was called to take a more conſpic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous part in the politicks of his country. He was <q>a magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate of the county in which he lived, and a judge of the court;</q> and in this capacity diſcharged his duty with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular applauſe. Clothed with righteouſneſs, he was <hi>eyes to the blind, and feet to the lame, and the cauſe,</hi> which he <hi>knew not,</hi> he <hi>ſearched out.</hi> When the rapacious hand of Britain was graſping at the liberties of America, he was honored by his fellow citizens with a ſeat in the firſt and ſecond Congreſs, which aſſembled to conſult the intereſts of the nation.</p>
            <p>SINCE the eſtabliſhment of our Independence, we have ſeen him acting a very intereſting and dignified part. We have ſeen him in our public councils like the ſtately cedar in the foreſt. He was Preſident of that Convention, which in the ſummer of '87, in Philadelphia, framed that excellent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Government, which is the Bulwark of American liberty. When, according to the Conſtitution, a man was ſought for, to ſit at helm and execute the laws, by the united voice of his country he was called to this important ſtation. On the 30th of April '89, in the City of New-York, amidſt the acclamations of thouſands, he was inaugurated Preſident of the United States.<note n="†" place="bottom">At this time he was clothed in a ſuit of American Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ufacture.</note> Twice was he thus publickly inveſted with the higheſt Office, which a grateful people could beſtow. With what honor to himſelf and advantage to his country he diſcharged the duties of this elevated action, let the bleſſing of millions teſtify, which followed him from the chair of ſtate to the peaceful retreats of private life. Thro' two ſucceſſive periods of the preſidency, while great convulſions were agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating the nations with whom we ſtood connected, with what wiſdom did he ſteer our national bark upon the <q>tempeſtuous ſea of Liberty?</q> Haughty Briton preyed upon our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce.

Unawed by fear, uninflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by party, like a rock in the midſt of the ſea againſt which the waves daſh in vain, he reſolved that we ſhould be reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as an Independent nation, and that no act of his ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve us in thoſe calamities under which Europe groaned. Succeſsful in his meaſures, and grown old in his country's ſervice, with a glory equal to his years, he nobly retired from the <q>boundleſs field of public action, inceſſant trouble and high reſponſibility,</q> and cheerfully aſſumed the Citizen.</p>
            <p>LET us now turn and contemplate this great man in the character of a WARRIOR. In the morning of life he exhibited proofs of his military Genius. "At the age of 15 he was entered a midſhipman on board a Britiſh ſhip of war, and had his baggage prepared for embarkation": but in compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with his mother's wiſhes, who expreſſed a "reluctance at his engaging in that profeſſion," he relinquiſhed the plan. Before he reached the age of 21 he was honored with the rank of major in the military department. In 53 we find him engaged in an important and perilous embaſſy to the French and Indians, who were making encroachments upon our weſtern frontiers. Behold the illuſtrious Waſhington, at the age of 21, preſſing through the wilderneſs on foot, with his proviſions on his back, to remonſtrate with the French commander, and treat with the hoſtile Tribes. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him with patriotic ardor entering upon this important ſervice, in an uncommonly ſevere ſeaſon, accompanied with few attendants! Ramſay, the Hiſtorian, ſays, but one.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:037493_0008_100D464156946928"/>THE next year, we find him with a Colonel's Commiſſion at the head of 300 men, going forth with dauntleſs courage to oppoſe theſe invaders of his country. Learning from a priſoner, that the enemy were 1500 ſtrong, he encamped with his little army, now encreaſed to about 400 effective men, at a place called the <hi>Great Meadows.</hi> Here he threw up ſome temporary works, which from his peculiar ſituation he named <hi>Fort Neceſſity.</hi> While he here waited, expecting reinforcements, he was attacked by nearly four times his number of French and Indians. In this deſperate ſituation, after a brave reſiſtance, worthy of himſelf, he nobly capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and marched out at the head of his troops with the honors of war.</p>
            <p>THE year following, GENERAL BRADDOCK came over with two veteran Regiments to the aſſiſtance of the colonies. But ſuch was the arrangement of rank that "no officer who did not <hi>immediately</hi> derive his commiſſion from the KING, could command one who did." Colonel WASHINGTON there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſigned his commiſſion, and as a volunteer and extra aid de camp, joined the General. In marching for fort <hi>du queſne,</hi> they were unexpectedly met by the enemy. A hard fought and bloody battle enſued, which terminated in the total defeat of Braddock's army. Colonel WASHINGTON nobly diſtinguiſhed himſelf on this trying occaſion. By <hi>his</hi> valor many were reſcued from ſlaughter on that calamitous day. <q>He was the only officer, whoſe duty obliged him to be on horſeback during the battle who was not either killed or wounded. Providence ſeemed to reſerve him to ſave from utter deſtruction the wreck of a defeated army.</q> With his brave provincials he covered the confuſed retreat, and haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to concert meaſures for their future ſafety. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fatigues of the preceeding day, we behold him with two guides travelling the dreary wilderneſs, in the darkſome night, and ſo exauſted in the morning, as to be under the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of being ſupported with cuſhions on his horſe! Noble youth! how did the love of country inflame thy breaſt? Preſident Davies, in a ſermon preached to a military compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the year '55, points him out to the public, as one, whom Providence had hitherto preſerved, in the moſt ſignal manner, for ſome important ſervice to his country.</p>
            <p>The government of Virginia, ſenſible of his merits, in a new commiſſion, placed him at the head of all the troops
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037493_0009_100D464306BDA988"/>
raiſed, and to be raiſed in that colony. This commiſſion he held with ſingular credit, till the French and Indians were entirely vanquiſhed, and tranquility was reſtored.</p>
            <p>IN '59 he exchanged the ſoldier for the citizen, married the widow Martha Curtis, and ſettled as a farmer at Mount Vernon. Here he cultivated the arts of peace, till the year '75, when by the unanimous vote of Congreſs, of whom he was himſelf a member, he was placed at the head of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the United States.</p>
            <p>WE come now to an intereſting period in the life of this great man. His actions from that day forward are familiar to our minds. We no longer contemplate him, as directing the forces of an individual ſtate; but as heading the armies of 13 ſtates in union; and founding an empire, which will riſe and riſe, till it ſhall far exceed the moſt celebrated empires of ancient date.</p>
            <p>LET us caſt ourſelves back to the commencement of the <hi>American Revolution.</hi> With what feelings will a recollecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the hopes and fears of that anxious day inſpire our minds? Happy in the inheritance left us by our fathers, we hoped ſtill to enjoy it; and to tranſmit it unimpaired to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity. The projects of Great Britain alarmed our fears. We ſaw this haughty nation, whom we had been taught to look up to, as to a parent, envying us the happineſs of free born ſons, and graſping at our liberties. On the one hand, to depreſs our ſpirits, the power of Britain was great. On the other, to excite our hopes and ſtimulate our exertions, the prize for which we were to contend was greater.</p>
            <p>WE were ſenſible, that we were in poſſeſſion of a goodly land, where we might eat in ſafety the increaſe of the field, and ſuck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock. We conſidered, that it was the gift of Heaven to our fathers, who fled from perſecution in their native land. We called to mind the dangers, which they braved: how they gat their bread by the peril of their lives becauſe of the ſword of the wilderneſs. We remembered how God was with them: how he protected them as the apple of his eye, and bore them as on eagles wings. We encouraged ourſelves, that the God of our fathers would be our God; and relying upon his aid, we reſolved to <hi>live</hi> and <hi>die</hi> like <hi>Freemen,</hi> in the full poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our rights.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:037493_0010_100D4644ADA1D2E0"/>STILL, <hi>fears</hi> were in the way. From one end of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to the other, the cry was made: There is no <hi>king</hi> in us and our <hi>counſellor</hi> is periſhed. The GOD of our pious fathers heard the cry, and preſented <hi>himſelf</hi> as our <hi>king.</hi> We paid him homage. He raiſed us up <hi>counſellors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our hearts were ſoon pained within us at the ſound of the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet &amp; the alarm of war. He raiſed us up <hi>warriors.</hi> He raiſed up WASHINGTON to head our armies, &amp; lead us on to Victory and Independence. To the aſtoniſhment of the world, the earth brought forth at once, &amp; a <hi>nation was born in a day!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TIME will not permit us to recapitulate the various incidents of the revolution in which the illuſtrious WASHINGTON ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſo glorious. Clouds and darkneſs many times reſted upon our proſpects; but in the moſt gloomy ſeaſon, this great man retained the affection and confidence of his fellow ſoldiers and fellow citizens. In the darkeſt hour, when hearts of oak were ready to yield, he remained firm and undaunted, &amp; never loſt ſight of the pillar of cloud, and the pillar of fire.</p>
            <p>BEHOLD him in the Jerſeys, with his little army, hunted up and down like a Patridge upon the mountains. Who but WASHINGTON could have inſpired his feeble band with courage, fleeing before a victorious enemy, and inſcribing upon the <hi>frozen</hi> ground, with their <hi>naked</hi> feet, their attachment to their General, in <hi>letters of blood?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT perhaps in no inſtance during the revolutionary war, does this great man appear ſo great, as in the cloſing ſcene. A victorious army was about to be diſbanded. The exhauſted reſources of the country rendered it impoſſible to give them preſent compenſation for their ſervices. By the artful inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of an anonymous writer the minds of Officers and Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were inflamed, and they were juſt ready to turn their ſwords upon that very country, which they had ſo gloriouſly defended. The illuſtrious WASHINGTON ſtepped forth. He conjured them by the rights of humanity, by the honor of ſoldiers, by the patriotiſm of citizens, not to <q>open the flood gates of civil diſcord, and deluge their riſing empire with blood.</q>
            </p>
            <p>HIS unbounded influence, over an army, which had parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipated in his toils and dangers, and been witneſſes of his wiſdom and valor, rendered him victorious. The tumult

ſubſided. They unanimouſly reſolved, that <q>no circumſtances of diſtreſs or danger, ſhould induce a conduct, that might tend to fully the reputation and glory they had acquired.</q>
            </p>
            <p>WITH what ſplendor does the, the noble WASHINGTON appear in this tranſaction? Why did he not, by a ſingle word, blow up into a <hi>blaze</hi> the ſeditious ſpark, and like Octavianus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire his ſoldiers to demand the <hi>conſulate</hi> for their General? Why did he not, like the conqueror of Italy and Egypt, with the unmeaning expreſſions of Liberty and Equality in his mouth, <hi>ſeize upon the adminiſtration of his country;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could ſwear by no greater, <hi>ſwear</hi> in <hi>his own name</hi>

                  </hi> over turned the Conſtitution of his Country.</note> and in the name of his comrades in arms, that he would main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a republic, upon the baſis of rational liberty &amp; equal rights? Deeds, like theſe, how hateful to the pure and elevated mind of WASHINGTON! With a dignity peculiar to himſelf, he ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered into the hands of Congreſs, the appointment, which he "accepted with diffidence"; and with heartfelt ſatisfaction, the bleſſing of millions attending him, retired from the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his country, hoping never to embark again on the "tempeſtuous and uncertain ocean of public life."</p>
            <p>THE wiſhes of his fellow citizens correſponded with his own, that he might never again be called to aſſume the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a ſoldier. But how vain are mortal wiſhes? His country once more demands his aid, as commander of her forces. He obeys the ſummons.</p>
            <p>HIS obedience could not reſult from motives of <hi>private intereſt</hi>: for with a noble generoſity, ſuch as he had been accuſtomed <note n="†" place="bottom">When appointed to command the American forces in 1775; and when he accepted the Preſidency of the United States, he expreſſly declared receiving any pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It could not reſult from a deſire of <hi>aggrandizing himſelf</hi> and <hi>family,</hi> by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of our <hi>republic,</hi> and the eſtabliſhment of a <hi>monarchy</hi> upon its ruins: for he knew that his lamp was nearly <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended,</hi> that a crown would <hi>tarniſh</hi> his glory, and that he had neither <hi>child</hi> nor <hi>brother.</hi> It muſt therefore have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted from that patriotiſm, which ever fired his breaſt, and from a conviction of the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of the <hi>meaſures</hi> adopted
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037493_0012_100D4648C0DF1560"/>
by <hi>adminiſtration.</hi> This conviction is completely ſtamped upon his letter of acceptance. Writing to the Preſident he ſays: <q>Satisfied, that you have <hi>ſincerely</hi> wiſhed and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored to avert war, and exhauſted to the <hi>laſt drop</hi> the cup of reconciliation, we can with pure hearts appeal to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for the juſtice of our cauſe; and may confidently truſt the final reſult to that kind Providence, who has heretofore, and ſo often, ſignally favored the people of theſe U. States. Thinking in this manner, and feeling how incumbent it is upon <hi>every perſon</hi> to <hi>contribute</hi> at all times to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's welfare, and <hi>eſpecially</hi> in a <hi>moment like the preſent, when every thing we hold dear and ſacred</hi> is ſo <hi>ſeriouſly threatened,</hi> I have finally determined to accept the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Commander in chief of the Armies of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States. I take the liberty to mention, that I muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline having my acceptance conſidered, as drawing after it any immediate charge upon the public; or that I can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any emoluments annexed to the appointment, before entering into a ſituation to incur expenſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>WITH what a glowing pencil does our beloved WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON here paint the ſentiments and feelings of his heart? And how many patriotic breaſts has this painting inſpired with ſimilar ſentiments and feelings?</p>
            <p>What pity is it, that ſuch friends to the world, ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors of the rights of men, ſhould ever die? But what man is he that liveth &amp; ſhall not ſee death? This great man has fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len! His luſtre as a CITIZEN, his eminence as a STATESMAN, his celebrity as a WARRIOR, were props too feeble to ſupport him. His coat of mail, which had ſhielded him, for ſuch a length of time, from the greateſt dangers, was no ſecurity. He fell in all his military trappings, and with all his martial honors upon him. While Capt. of the American hoſt, and in full poſſeſſion of himſelf, at the firſt ſummons, he reſigned his commiſſion into the hands of death. How great is that power, to which ſo great a General, ſo readily ſubmits!</p>
            <p>WE ſhall retire to our dwellings impreſſed with the vanity of all earthly greatneſs. God has taken from us the judge and the prudent, the ancient and the honorable, the mighty Man, and the Man of War. How humbling to our pride is the conſideration, that no circumſtances or degree of greatneſs, are of any avail when the King of Terrors advances? The greateſt general muſt die like men, and fall like one of the Peaſants.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:037493_0013_100D464AD6643938"/>WE ſhall retire to our dwellings, filled with Grief, that ſo much greatneſs and goodneſs muſt ſubmit to death. What gloom overſpreads the mind, when we contemplate in duſt, the illuſtrious citizen, who with patriotic fervour eſpouſed the cauſe of mankind, emancipated his country from impend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bondage, and ſecured the happineſs of millions?</p>
            <p>WE ſhall retire to our dwellings, inſpired with ſentiments of gratitude to God, for raiſing up and continuing to us ſo long, a man ſo extenſively great and good. God is never in want of inſtruments to accompliſh the important purpoſes of his providence. When the time drew near, in which this land was to be planted with civilized men, he raiſed up Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, and endowed him with a ſpirit of enterprize, adequate to the important diſcoveries, which he made. When the days were accompliſhed, and we muſt emerge from under tutors &amp; governors, and aſſume a ſtation among the nations of the earth, he raiſed up and ſent us Waſhington, furniſhed in a peculiar manner for the part aſſigned him in this grand event. He, who raiſed him up, has choſen the beſt time for his removal. America has never ſeen the day, when ſhe could have ſpared him ſo well. Age might have diminiſhed, but nothing could have encreaſed the glory of his Character. He had complet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his work, and it was juſt, that he ſhould receive his wages. He has gloriouſly retired in his full ſtrength; and neither time nor mortals have it in their power to obſcure his bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The unerring judge of men will weigh all his great actions in an even ballance, and diſtinguiſh him with ſuitable rewards.</p>
            <p>THERE is a wonderful coincidence of character, between the LEADERS of God's ancient &amp; his American Iſrael. They were both peculiarly watched over and inſtructed in the days of youth. They were both Preſidents in council and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals in the Field. They both delivered their Brethren from bondage, and eſtabliſhed them in Freedom and Independence. They both brought their reſpective nations in ſight of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent ſeat for their public councils. A few ſteps more, &amp; the iſraelitiſh nation would have pitched their Government in Canaan. A few ſteps more, and the American nation would have pitched their Government in the City of Waſhington. MOSES longed for the completion of his peoples travels, and to go with them, and ſee them in full, poſſeſſion of the good land, which was beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain and

WASHINGTON longed for the completion of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's foreign and domeſtic trials, and to go with them, and ſee their Government permanently ſeated in that goodly city, which is called by his own name.
