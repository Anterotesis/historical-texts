            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Mayor, <hi>and</hi> Gentlemen <hi>of this</hi> City <hi>and</hi> Corporation,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>ALTHO' I have comply'd with your Desires at this Juncture, and always find a very agreeable Satisfaction within my self, when it is in my Power to contribute any Thing towards the Happiness and Prosperity of a People, who are immediately under my Care, yet I must put you in Mind, that your Gratitude on this Occasion is principally, and I may say wholly due to the benign Influences of a most gracious KING, by whose Authority you are now happily possess'd of many Valuable and Great Privileges, and whose Royal Pattern of Love and Tenderness to all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, must inspire such as have the Honour to be employ'd under him in the Administration of the Affairs of Government, with some Share of that mild, but just and steddy Conduct, which so eminently shines from the Throne in a much greater Lustre, than has been known to this, or any former Age.</p>
            <p>WHEN we consider the happy Period unto which the Wisdom of his present Majesty has brought not only the Affairs of has own Dominions, but of all <hi>Europe,</hi> it is impossible for us to withstand the Force of our Duty to such a Prince, whose Rule and Command terminates in the particular Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his own People, and a general Benevolence to Mankind.</p>
            <p>A FREQUENT and grateful Remembrance of the many Blessings we enjoy under the present Reign, must certainly stir up in us a very affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Sense of the common Benefits that attend an Equal, Just, and Free Government, where the Magistrates are esteemed and respected in their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Degrees, according to the Opportunities which they have of maintaining the Rights and Liberties of the People with Regard to that Legal Constitution upon which they are Founded, and by which only they can be preserved.</p>
            <p>NATURE simply considered without the Improvement of Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, does indeed put Mankind on a perfect Equality; but since the abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Necessity of Human Society proceeds from the reciprocal Obligations which in the Course of Life Men cannot avoid receiving from each other; it will follow, that the Government of any Society is only the voluntary Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of an Artificial, but just Force, upon every individual Person, to discharge such Obligations as he has received from the Publick or his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002542_0002_0FDB4C764C9A70C0"/>
with Justice and Gratitude: As any Magistrate therefore, who will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to exercise the Authority of his Office, beyond the equitable Intent, and plain Sense of this General Rule, may doubtless be charg'd with Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and Partiality; so on the other Hand, what Person soever shall take upon him to vilify or detract from the Character of any PRINCE, GOVER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOUR, or other inferiour Magistrate in Authority, who evidently make this equitable Principle the Rule of their Actions; he will be distinguished, by every just and good Man, either as an open Enemy to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, or as an abject Slave to his own vile and unruly Passions, which not only render him incapable of doing or intending any Good to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, but even of receiving and enjoying the common Benefits which of Right appertain to the Freedom of an <hi>English</hi> Government.</p>
            <p>THE long Acquaintance which I have had, with the principal Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of this Place, encourages me to hope, that a due Reflection on those Things which I have now recommended to the present Magistracy of this City, will in some Measure assist them and their Successors, to act in their several Stations from Time to Time, as becomes Loyal Subjects, Faithful Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, and affectionate good Neighbours: Always considering that their own Honour, Interest and Reputation must be built upon the Ease and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of the People under their Care, and on no other Foundation whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
