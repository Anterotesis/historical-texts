            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>I do not here affirm, That <hi>every Diſciple</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, has an immediate Right to partake of this Sacrament, or is in a preſent Capacity to receive it; but, That for Perſons to be Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Chriſt, is ſo neceſſary, that without this no Man has a Right to the Lord's Supper.

But we muſt not think, that becauſe theſe were all of them <hi>Miniſter,</hi> yea <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> to whom Chriſt firſt gave the Sacrament, it will from hence follow, that none but Miniſters have a Right to it. The Command of <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring</hi> this Ordinance, was indeed only given to <hi>Miniſters;</hi> but that of <hi>receiving</hi> of it was not ſo, but belonged to <hi>Diſciples,</hi> as ſuch, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were Miniſters, or others.

               <p n="3">3. It is to be feared, that on the Hypotheſis oppoſed, many may be <hi>hindred</hi> from Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in ſpecial Ordinances, who have a <hi>good Right</hi> to them; and others <hi>admitted</hi> that have <hi>none.</hi> People being fixed in this Principle, That none but the Regenerate have a Right to ſpecial Ordinances many, even of thoſe, who are very ſeriouſly concerned that they may approve themſelves to God, being in great Doubt of the Sincerity of their own Hearts, are in all Likelihood hereby kept back from offering themſelves to join in Church Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. It is evident, that the more ſerious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons be, the greater Senſe they have of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs and deſperate Wickedneſs of their own Hearts, by Nature; and ſuch as theſe are very apt to be proportionably doubtful of their own Sincerity. Theſe feel and obſerve ſo much Corruption working in them, that they cannot eaſily perſwade themſelves of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of their own Souls, and ſo dare not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in a long Time, if ever, to join themſelves to the Church of Chriſt; and ſo <hi>the Church</hi> is hindred from having many Members, who are indeed, fit Matter for it, and <hi>ſuch ſerious Souls,</hi> from the Advantages and Comforts, which they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Such as theſe can, therefore, without any great Difficulty, offer themſelves to the Communion of the Church; and thus great Numbers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably do while, on their own Principles, they are unqualified for it; and by this Means Churches are corrupted rather than kept pure and holy.</p>
               <p n="4">4 I would ask this Queſtion; Is there not ſome Danger, That, on the Principle I oppoſe, Perſons ſubmitting themſelves to Examination, with Reſpect to the State of their Souls, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their Admiſſion to the Sacrament, may be very greatly hurt, either by having too fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable a Judgment paſſed on their Condition: or otherwiſe too ſevere a Sentence or Cenſure, with Reſpect to it?

here, if ſuch a Miſtake be committed, may greatly hurt the Perſon concerned in the Sentence, about whoſe Eſtate it is given.

I thought indeed before, that I was in a regenerate State, but now I have the Judgment of the Brethren and Elders of the Church in my Favour: Why then ſhould I doubt of this When yet the poor Man is ſtill in the Gall of Bitterneſs and in the Bond of Iniquity, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 8.23.
