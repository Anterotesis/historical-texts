            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Treatise Upon Husbandry or Planting in BARBADOS.</head>
            <p>IT is an obvious Remark, that the Profits arising from Husbandry are always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate to the Care and Attention we give it. And as it is acknowledged by all that a Plantation, seasonably cultivated in this Island, will yield great Profits, <hi>if judiciously managed;</hi> which, if not strictly attended to, will, on Account of the Variety of Accidents, to which it is by its Nature subject, soon become a Charge and Debtor to the Owner; it would be superfluous and unnecessary to urge the Necessity, or enumerate the Advantages, of a constant Attention to the Management of a Plantation.</p>
            <p>What I now propose in this little Treatise is, <hi>First,</hi> To recommend some Rules and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods by which I conceive a Plantation may be managed to the greatest Advantage. And those will be calculated particularly for the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement of one of five hundred Acres of Land.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I shall recommend what Buildings are proper, what Number of Negroes is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent 
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:007356_0003_102B5D52C6675FB0"/>
and what Stock of different Sorts is requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to work up to the height an Estate of that Size: To which I shall add some Observations upon, and some Directions for, the making of <hi>Rum</hi> and the improvement of <hi>Sugar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> I shall fix the Value of the Estate after it is compleatly built and stocked, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate the annual Expences of it.—And if any Thing that I shall offer on this Subject shall in the least contribute to the Benefit of Masters or the Improvement of Managers, my Design will be answered. If it should be thought that I have not succeeded, I hope the Candour of my Readers will restrain their Censures and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of these my well meant Endeavours: I further hope they will in such Case be rather inclined to lend their Assistance to a Work which may prove serviceable to the Publick. A consideration which has induced me to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish these plain Observations which were at first made for my own Amusement and Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I shall now begin to shew what I think is the best Method of preparing the Land for <hi>Canes,</hi> and of planting and reaping a <hi>Crop;</hi> for which End I shall divide the Business of the Year, and prescribe what is proper to be done in each Month.</p>

               <p>AN Acre of Land contains 43560 Feet. Now to know the Number of Holes that will be contained in an Acre at any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Distance which you design to line at, you must divide the Number of Feet in an Acre by the Number of Feet that will be contained in one Hole, Bank and Distance; and your Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient will give you the Number of Holes in the Acre at that lineing. <hi>As for Example,</hi> if you line at five Feet one way, and three and half Feet a-cross, you'l have in one Hole, Bank and Distance seventeen Feet and half, which make your Divisor, and the Number of Feet in the Acre, your Dividend, your Quotient will give you the Number of Holes: which you'l find it is necessary to know to be enabled to propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion your Dung; by this Method you will know to a Certainty the Quantity of Dung you'l require, not only for one Field, but for the whole Crop you purpose to plant; without

               </p>
               <p>These are the Distances at which we generally line the Land; except it be in a very poor Soil, where the <hi>Canes</hi> do not sucker and bunch by an After-spring: In such places we line closer; for the Quality of the Soil should govern the Distance of Holeing.—The Distance I would recommend as most proper to hole at in most Parts of the Island is four Feet every Way. By holeing at this Distance you turn up and manure more of the Soil, and also give the Canes the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Air, which is as necessary to Vegetation as Heat or Moisture. But what I do most earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recommend is to turn up all the Land you design to plant at least two Months before you hole it. If it be turned up six or eight Inches, 
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007356_0006_102B5D58B90440A0"/>
and lie that Time before it be holed, you will never fail of a vigorous Spring—If it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected that this Method is attended with too great Labour, and an expence of Time, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that he who treats his Land in this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, so effectually destroys all the Weeds, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be the invincible Nut-Grass,) and so mellows the Land, that the Time afterwards saved in those two Articles, is at least equal to that spent in turning it up.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>Dung,</hi> the Article upon which the success of a Crop almost intirely depends, it is I think impossible to prescribe any particular Rule for the making it: However so far as I am able to explain my own Method, I will.</p>
               <p>When a sett of Pens is fixt, I think it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per at the same Time, to throw up as much Mould as will be sufficient to serve the whole Sett. And I advise every one most carefully to avoid the use of poor and hungry Mould. He who can supply himself from Gulleys or Mould-Holes, will find that the Time and Trouble it costs him to make his Dung with Mould gathered from such Places, will be very inconsiderable, with respect to the great Benefits he may expect to reap therefrom. It has been 
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007356_0007_102B5D5D64652B50"/>
a Custom of long standing, to mould Pens once every Fortnight; the Stratum of Mould, four Inches, that of Trash, when close trodden, two Inches.</p>
               <p>I have already given my Opinion of the Mould most proper to be used for <hi>Dung:</hi> to which I shall add, that only such a Quantity should be laid upon the Pens, as is just suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to retain the Tincture, which it may be thought to receive from the Time of one Moulding to the next.</p>
               <p>For whatever may be thought of Quantity, I am of Opinion, that he who makes the best, makes the most <hi>Dung.</hi>—As to Trash, which is used by many, I do intirely exclude it, raw and unprepared; except what is sufficient to preserve the Cattle from Mud and Mire in the wet Seasons.—The Litter from the Stable, if a sufficient Number of Horses be kept on an Estate, will be always enough for the Pens; provided it be properly managed.—This is an Article, on which much might be said: But as Men differ widely in their Opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the use of it, I shall not prescribe what Time it ought to lie in the Stable before it be cleaned out, or how it should be afterwards applied.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="unknown:007356_0008_102B5D5EE7F533C8"/>
My own Opinion is, that the longer it lies together in the Stable, the more it contributes to the Improvement of the Dung; provided when it be taken from the Stable, it be immediately thrown upon the Pens and covered with Mould: It being then hot, and that Heat confin'd by the Mould that is thrown over it, it ferments and divides, and separates the Mould; and thereby produces good Dung. While I am speaking upon Dung, I must not neglect stre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously to recommend the turning of it as often as it is convenient and consistent with other Business.</p>
               <p>In order to know how many Head of Cattle a Pen of any Size requires, allowing ten square Feet to every Beast, you must multiply one Square by the other. <hi>As for Example.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <table>
                     <row>
                        <cell>A Pen of 30 Feet square, 9 Head of Cattle.</cell>

                     <row>

                     </row>
                  </table>
               </p>
               <p>And so continue the Proportion for a Pen of any Size: And to know the Number of square Feet of Dung any Heap contains, you must multiply the Squares together, which Product 
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:007356_0009_102B5D622C7E03C0"/>
multiply by the Thickness, and that gives you the Number of solid Feet of Dung: <hi>As for Example.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Pen of 20 Feet square and 2 Feet thick, is 800 solid Feet,—which when well cured and digested will weigh about 80 Pounds. But 50 or 60 Pounds of good Dung may be sufficient for each Hole.</p>
               <p>The general Allowance at present, is a square or solid Foot of Dung to each Hole, which ought to be well cured and digested, and laid one half in the bottom of the Holes, and the other on the Plants. If the Land is most, and the Canes generally bunch well, two or three good Plants will be sufficient; for it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, by putting in too many Plants, the Canes are withy and yield little: but in late or unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Planting, many Plants should be used. By knowing the Number of Feet in a heap of Dung, and the Number of Holes in an Acre of Land, we become enabled to calculate our Dung for that Number of Acres we design to make our Crop consist of.</p>
               <p>Not more than one fourth of the Cane Land should be annually planted in Canes. Now in order to calculate your Dung for the Crop, 
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007356_0010_102B5D63C016EB30"/>
you are first to find out the Number of Holes that each Piece of Land will contain, according to the Distance you line at; This will inform you what Number of Pens, and of what Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions, the Piece will require; allowing a Foot of Dung to each Hole.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observe,</hi> to situate your Dung-Heaps most convenient for the Carriage, as that is a great Article of the Labour, both in making the Dung, and throwing it to the Holes, for you are to avoid making more Dung in one Heap, than will serve two Acres, least you increase the Labour on your Slaves, who ought to be eased and encouraged as much as possible. Another Thing by which they are greatly oppressed is, the planting a greater Number of Acres than the Plantation can well afford; by which the Cattle are deprived of the grazing they require, and bad Shifts used every Year to keep up an equal Quantity; which is a vast Prejudice. A proper Number and Strength of Slaves should always be kept on a Plantation, and no Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance had upon hired Labour; which will oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion many Disappointments, and forces the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman to do many Things out of Season, by which he must fail of Success.</p>

As these Particulars are very hurtful to the Owners of Plantations as well as to the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Husbandman, whose Care they are under, those who have Estates under their Direction should supply them with all necessaries for their better Improvement.</p>
               <p>The want of a sufficient Stock of Cattle and Horses, to make the Dung within due Time, is attended with many Inconveniences, and a manifest Loss. And I not only recommend a proper Quantity of those, but a sufficient Strength of Negroes; whom I would employ on a Work, which though of much Consequence, has been very little thought of. I mean to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide a Plenty of Meat to feed the Cattle on the Pens, and to gather as many green Bushes, Vines, &amp;c. as possible, which with every Thing of the vegetable Kind, will greatly improve the Dung.</p>

your dry Grain of all Sorts; though you will have several Gathers of the Pigeon-Pease, &amp;c. after you have reaped the Corn; If you can avoid it, do not plant the Pigeon-Pease in the Guinea Corn-Fields, as that will prevent your grazing your Cattle after you have gather'd your Corn, and which should be done to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble your Cattle to perform the Labour of your Crop; and besides that Disadvantage, when your Pease Trees are full of Blossoms in the Month of <hi>November,</hi> the high Winds then will strike the Stalks of the Corn against the Boughs of the Pease, and brush off the Blossoms and young Pease, and in the beginning of <hi>January</hi> before the Corn is ripe enough to reap, the same Stalks will strike those Boughs of Pease which then will be full of dry Grain, and husk them out, thefore they ought if possible to be separate.</p>
                  <p>Cut down your Corn Stalks for Fewel, and provide as much as you possibly can of Brush, &amp;c. for your Stoke-Holes. As your Watchmen are now called in, get immediately to making Sugar. It is best to avoid grinding Canes on a Saturday: If many Canes are cut down, and left all Night in the Field, or at the Mill, they must be carefully watched or well secured, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they will be greatly stolen. The Fewel

should be dry to make the Coppers boil well; and the Stokers should be engaged to keep re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular constant good Fires. The Boilers should be very diligent in well attending the Coppers, and very well cleaning the Liquor only of the Filth; and not throw down to the Still-House any Liquor that may be made into Sugar: And you should never boil after 11 o'Clock at Night at the latest.—Skip your Sugar at an equal moderate due Height; and neither Pot it too hot, or too cold.—Although your Canes will yield but indifferently in this Month, you'l find it more to your Advantage to meet your Loss at the beginning of the Crop than at the close of it. Don't let your Cattle run too long over your Guinea Corn Stumps, because you'l want that Supply of Meat for your Stock which you'l require upon finishing the Crop, and thereby be reduced to assign the too common, which indeed is an idle Reason, for not closing the Crop: i. e. <q>If I should finish my Crop, the Stock must starve.</q>

If you have Showers, be sure to supply your young Canes with Tops, and fill up your Still Pond with all you design to put in it: And prepare as much Fewel as you can possibly; and charge round all your Dung Pits, that you may have nothing to interfere with making of Sugar the whole ensuing Month.

Raise your Mill Points, and put all your Affairs in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for you have little to do but to reap your Provisions, as they are all near ripe at this Time, and is the most proper Employ for the Slaves, as their Spirits and Flesh must be reduced after the Year's Fatigue of hard Labour: Weed over all your young Canes, and when I say, mould your Canes, I would not be understood to draw down the Banks as was the former Practice, for by that Method, without the greatest Care, the 
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:007356_0021_102B5D7B5E67DFE0"/>
Slaves will draw down so much Earth as destroys the Succours, therefore dig up the Banks and Distances, but besure to do it when the Land is very dry, by which Practice you'l the more effectually destroy the Weeds or Grass, and give them the greater Nourishment, from every small Shower, even the Dews in the Night, will pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate to their Advantage. Now you have 100 Acres of Canes well and seasonably planted, and your Pens in some part of the 50 Acres of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatoe Pieces which were lately dug out, as the whole 50 Acres will come into the next Year's 100 Acres (the 10 Acres you dug the Yams out of, and the 15 that the Eddoes were in, put into Potatoes) and of the 60 Acres that were drawn for Plants, 50 Acres of them will make up the next Year's ensuing 100. And that other 10 of the 60 may be planted with Yams: Now this 100 Acres of first Crop Canes is in good Order: And I will suppose I had 40 Acres of second Crop kept out of the last Year's 100 Acres, which are now to be broken with the 100 Acres of first Crop, which is to be reaped in the Manner I shall recommend by the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation I shall describe.</p>
                  <p>A Plantation of five hundred Acres of Land requires,—A Dwelling-House,—Two Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Mills, 
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:007356_0022_102B5D7CF17B6B60"/>
—A Boiling-House,—A Distilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>House,—A Curing-House large enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain at least 2500 Pots,—A Stable to hold thirty Horses, with a Loft over it for dry Grain,—A Rum-House,—An House: for Servants,—A Sick-House,—A proper Room to confine disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly Negroes,—A Store-House for Salt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,—A Smith-Shop,—A Cooper's-Shop,—A Trash-House,—And a Store for English Goods. It requires three hundred Slaves,—An hundred and fifty head of Cattle,—Twenty five Horses,—Fifty head of Sheep.</p>
                  <p>I would chuse the Boiling-House to contain eighteen Coppers of three different Sizes, viz. Three Tatches at each End; two Cleansers to each Side, each to contain two hundred and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty five Gallons; and four Clarifiers to each End, each to contain three hundred Gallons. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion them in this Manner, because if the Person, who stands at the Clarifier does his Duty, there will not be more than twenty five per Ct. of Filth and aqueous Matter exhausted when the Liquor is fit to be sent forward to be Strained.—</p>
                  <p>The Distilling House should have three Stills to contain 900 Gallons of Liquor, and a Fourth big enough to contain the low Wines produced 
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:007356_0023_102B5D7F7AF47FB0"/>
from the other three. It will require 48 Vats of three hundred Gallons each, although 36 Vats will employ those Stills twice a Day thro'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Week, as 12 times the Stills is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of 36 Vats at 300 Gallons each: But as Liquor requires to be fallen some short Time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you distill it, and as there are frequent Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations in the falling, as well as in the yielding of Liquor, though several Vessels may be set at the same Time, and every Proportion alike: You will not be able to Distill above 36 Vats per Week; However there is a Necessity to keep the 48 employed, that you may always be provided with a sufficiency of Liquor fallen. It will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the Boiling-House to make 300 Pots of Sugar per Week to employ those Vessels and Stills, for each Pot of Sugar will afford 12 or 13 Gallons of Skimings; but suppose only 12 Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons per Pot, 12 times 300 is 3600 Gallons of Skimings, which being mixed at a Proportion of 25 per Cent Skimings, will set the 48 Vats of 300 Gallons each, or the 14400 Gallons of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, or being mixed at a Proportion of some of the following Receipts will produce a Gallon of proof Rum to every six Gallons of fermented Liquor, as 2400 Gallons of Rum is the one sixth Part of 14400 Gallons of that Liquor. I would not be understood by this Calculation that it is 
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:007356_0024_102B5D81349453C0"/>
infallible; nor that you are to expect this Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess by being confined to any particular Receipt: for I have already hinted, that you will meet sundry Variations which will require the Distil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers Attention to watch every Circumstance: for although it has been calculated that five Gallons of Skimings is equal to one Gallon of Molasses, yet it is not so throughout every Month, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times four, sometimes six, and I have known eight: which Discovery is to be made from the Quantity of Spirit extracted: here let me observe, that there is a great Difference between a weak and a firm bodied Sugar, or Sugar boiled very high, and that which is boiled very low. I would be understood herein, that when the Crop is finished, and the Boiling-House and Still-House Journals are fairly adjusted, that then you'l find upon an Average, you'l not be short of eight Gallons to a Pot of Double-clayed Sugar, which yields in the Total 5½ Gallons of Molasses, and if the Skimings from it yields equal to 2½ Gallons of Molasses, those Materials must be sufficient for eight Gallons of Rum, as 8 times 300 is 2400, which Quantity of Rum may be produced from 14400 Gallons of Liquor set from the Offals of the 300 Pots of Double-clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sugar. It was formerly generally imagined that there could not be more Rum made from 
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:007356_0025_102B5D8632B44150"/>
a Pot of Double-clayed Sugar than five Gallons without Prejudice to the Boiling-House, but this Mistake is now rectified, and it is allowed that eight Gallous of Rum may with Care be made from a ten Gallon Pot of Double-clayed Sugar. But you must strictly attend to the following Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations (the Liquor that will make a ten Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon Pot of Sugar, will afford 12 or 13 Gallons of Skimings, and that Pot double-clayed will yield 5½ Gallons of Molasses, and the Skimings being equal to 2½, makes it eight Gallons per Pot.)</p>

Never throw in your Molasses before you discover the Liquor to ferment, which it will, within twenty-four Hours, unless your Returns with which it was set, was too hot; be careful to skim the Liquor constantly, and to let it lay close covered, at least twenty-four Hours, after it has fallen, before you distill it; for there is a Fermentation beneath, after it disappears upon the Surface. Never let a Vessel remain empty while you have Molasses, though you may be without Skimings, and be sure every Time you empty a Vessel to wash out that thick Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with thin Return-Liquor before you fill it again. It will require you to have three Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn-Cisterns, by which you'l always be furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with thin cool Returns, and by keeping them as clean, as I have recommended the Vats to be kept, you'l escape that Miscarriage which often happens by thick Returns.</p>
               <p>It is also necessary to have three Receiving Cisterns, one for Water, and the other two for Skimings, for all thick Matter is a great Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction to Fermentation or Circulation.

               <p>An ancient Practice was one third of each with 10 <hi>per Cent</hi> Molasses, and I have known it suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed very well. You are always to have Regard to the Difference between Muscovado-Sugar Molasses, and Clay'd-Sugar Molasses, as also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the firm and the weak Sugar, as well as the high boiled and the low boiled Sugar. You'l find it necessary to make Tryal of all those differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Receipts 'till you discover that which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers best, and which Prudence will direct your Continuance of. To say any Thing of Mixing without the Skimings will be quite immaterial, 
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:007356_0028_102B5D8C19357DC0"/>
because the Quantity and Quality of Sweets is to be your Guide, and therefore I shall conclude here. Those various Proportions of mixing the Liquor have been known to answer at different Times and in different Vessels, which cannot be wonder'd at, when we consider what Variety Distillation affords.</p>
               <p>I shall now proceed to make some Remarks upon claying Sugar. A free Sugar fairly Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, Boiled and Tempered, will be fit to Clay in 12 or 15 Days; but to judge the better of it, start it out of the Pot, and if the Molasses has past through ⅔ of the Pot, return it in the same Position and clay it thus; dig up the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar so deep as to be sure to take out all that Part that is called the Fountain, which will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear like a Plate of Glue and lies a little below the Surface of the Sugar, and which if not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully taken out will obstruct the Office or Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of the Clay; then pound or break your Sugar very fine and level it very firm, leaving a little Hollow in the Middle or Center of the Pot, then examine your Clay that it be stiff or Wax like, which you will be able to discover by the quantity of Water it will require to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it to a proper Pulp, for the more Water your Clay will bear the better, as the Clay is no 
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:007356_0029_102B5D8E4FF2E6A8"/>
other than the Vehicle to retain the Water and to deliver the same gradually for the Use that the Sugar requires to alter it's Colour. Clay that will bear 25 Gallons of Water to 100 Wt. will always best answer the Purpose, and when it requires more, then the Use of Bay-Sand is necessary to open the Body of such Clay, for the Eye alone will never be able to make a sufficient Discovery, though such Clay is rare to be met with: and the want of true Judgment in the sort of Clay, and the proper Management of it, oversets in the Curing-House all the Care, Pains and Judgment that has been used in the Boiling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>House, then the common and idle Excuse is assigned, (i. e.) <q>the Soil will not make white Sugar.</q>
               </p>
               <p>If your Sugar be a very firm Body, put one Gallon of this Batter to each ten Gallon Pot the first Claying, which may lie on ten Days, and ten Days after that, second Clay it with six Pints of the like Batter, but if your Sugar be weak or low Boiled, put less in Quantity, and make the Batter thicker and so in Proportion to a Pot of any Size. You must always observe to dry your Clay extreamly well in the Sun before you weigh and mix it.—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="unknown:007356_0030_102B5D9220D49E08"/>
I shall proceed to say something in Relation to melting down or improving Sugar from a coarse Stock.</p>
               <p>Take 1000 Weight of the Bottoms of Clayed Sugar well dryed in the Sun, to which add one third of that Weight of white Lime-Water, all which mix in the Copper 'till it is well incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, then take one Gallon and a half of Blood (of your Cattle) and divide it into three equal Parts, and to each Part add half a Gallon of white Lime-Water, with each of which raise a Scum, by a very gentle Fire, which as soon as you observe to begin to break, draw back your Fire, and let it remain half an Hour to gather up the Scum which the Use of the Fire will raise, and the quality of the Blood will close, which Scum take off with a steady Hand, left you sink that Filth to the Bottom, from whence it will not ascend; and so continue to repeat the Use of the Blood with which you'l raise many Scums: in like Manner act with 100 Eggs, only the Whites, ten each Time, with some Lime-Water, which will raise many Scums and clear the Syrrup off that reddish Colour the Blood may have given it; then keep up a strong Fire, and well work your Liquor by brewing and beating it with the Skimmer, to raise the 
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:007356_0031_102B5D93A284A3B0"/>
Scum, which, with a nimble light Hand will soon procure a fine Transparent Syrrup, then strain it into your Tatch and Boil it off with the quickest Fire, observing to make three Skips of it, the first of a very low Muscovado Height, the second a little higher, and the third a full Height, all which mix well in your Cooler by stirring and brewing, and Pot it hot enough to admit of a third Stirring in the Pots; your Pots must be very clean as well as dry.—In three or four Days you may clay it according to the Directions given in the foregoing to clay Sugar, and in eight Days you may second Clay it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the former Prescriptions.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>To Refine the foregoing Stock you may do it thus:</head>
               <p>Take any Quantity of it, to which add ¾ of the ⅓ of its Weight in fair Water, and well mix and incorporate it, then make Use of 100 or more Eggs in raising many Scums as before pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, and with all Diligence and Caution at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to your Fire, that it may be timely drawn back, and a proper Time given to gather up the Scum and Filth, and so continue to repeat until you have used all the Eggs, then well cleanse your Syrrup and strain it into the Tatches 
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:007356_0032_102B5D96134CC7D8"/>
and then boil it to a low Muscovado Height, it will require great exactness, left it run too high, for that Error is without Remedy, Pot it, Stir and Clay it as before advised.</p>
               <p>I would advise this Plantation of 500 Acres to be laid off by Survey in ten Acre-Fields, and that the Cane-Fields, &amp;c. may be formed in Chequer Order, that it may be convenient to carry the Trash to the Neighbouring Pieces to make Dung, and the Plants to plant it; and of the 500 Acres you'l have 100 Acres every Year in first Crop, and as you'l have 150 head of Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, 25 Horses and 50 head of Sheep: this Stock with the Still-Pond will be sufficient Dung for the 100 Acres, which being so season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably Planted, and with such a Proportion of Tincture, you may reasonably expect a very good Produce from the second Crop, 40 Acres of which you are to reserve for Sugar Annually: All the rest of the Plantation must be in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions, Pastures, Wood for Negro Houses (which ought to be kept in good Order, as more Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes dye for want of proper Houses than by other Means) Cattle Pens, Yards, and Commons. I would always have 50 Acres of Potatoes plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at different Times, as they are a ready Food for Human and animal Creatures, and greatly 
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:007356_0033_102B5D9A0EF43770"/>
improve the Land, and exclusive of those Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations they will save you that great Expence of planting Indian Corn in the young Canes cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>November</hi> Crop, which is extreamly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to those Canes as Experience has proved; for such a Field of Canes wherein a fine <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> Crop of Corn has been reaped, have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to shew a regular Distinction in each Row until those Canes have been cut to make Sugar, and that Discovery could be made at a very distant Prospect from the Field.</p>
               <p>I would recommend instead of moulding your young Canes according to the former Custom, to dig up the intermediate Spaces, such as the Banks and Distances, and to perform it always when the Earth is very dry, and repeat this fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently at the Distance of ten or fifteen Days until you have brought all the hard Lumps of Earth into a fine Mould, through which all Moisture will constantly penetrate to the Roots of the Canes; by this Husbandry it may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable to expect near fifty Pots per Acre, which with 40 Acres of second Crop Canes we may reasonably hope, will yield five Thousand Pots per Annum; the remaining sixty Acres of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Crop Canes you must keep very clean to raise you a Sufficiency of Plants to plant the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing 
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:007356_0034_102B5D9B92231100"/>
100 Acres. Prudence will direct you Yearly to exchange your Cane Pieces, whereby the whole 100 Acres will become changed every fourth Year; but be sure to observe and keep up the Figure of your Husbandry in a regular Chequer Order to manifest your Abilities in that Office as well as your Discretion, by contracting the Labour of the Husbandry, and by this conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Exchange of your Cane-Fields, you'l very much enrich your Pastures, to the vast Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of your Cattle: In all your Land, wherein your Dung is made by the first Day of <hi>May</hi> (which ought to be at least sixty Acres as you removed in <hi>November,</hi>) be sure to plant a large Crop of Indian Corn in every Row, and to hole through it as early as the Corn can bear the Cane Bank, from which you may reap eight Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred or a Thousand Bushels of that sort of Corn; and from 100 Acres of Guinea-Corn well taken Care of, may be reaped from fifteen Hundred to two Thousand Bushels of Corn, which with the constant supply of the Potatoes out of the fifty Acres within the Year, and the Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the twenty Acres of Plantain-walk to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the green and dry Grain, and the 10 Acres of Yams, and the 15 Acres of Eddoes, and 5 Acres of Casavy, will certainly be sufficient Food for 300 Slaves, provided these Provisions 
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:007356_0035_102B5D9DFA722498"/>
are as seasonably Planted and as well taken care of as before recommended; and provided also no Accident happens to any of those several Sorts of Provisions. With the Conveniences, Strength, &amp;c. before-mention'd, it will be in the Power of the Husband-man to do every Thing in its most proper Season, I mean not to be a Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when he ought to be Reaping, or a Reaping when he ought to be Planting: Therefore he may reap this Crop of Sugar in about twenty Weeks by making about three Hundred Pots per Week, and as his Still-House will contain 14400 Gallons of Liquor, and dispatch 10800 Gallons of it into a Discharge of 1800 Gallons of Rum per Week; therefore within 26 or 27 Weeks, the Still-House may dispence with the Offals of the five Thousand Pots of Double<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clayed Sugar, and according to that Calculation of Time the Sugar may be all made by the close of <hi>May,</hi> or very early in <hi>June;</hi> and the Rum by the close of <hi>August,</hi> or early in <hi>September:</hi> for as there is sufficient Room reserved for more Sugar and Rum to be made, if Accidents should happen to prevent the Regularity before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, you'l not be confin'd in any case; therefore it is necessary that the Curing-House should have Room to contain two Thousand five Hundred Pots of Clayed-Sugar as is before 
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:007356_0036_102B5D9F92E59DB0"/>
expressed; and as this Sugar when Double<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clayed may be sent to Market in ten Weeks after it is made, and there is a sufficient Still<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>House to dispense with the Offals, I see no just Reason why this Still-House should be making Rum in the wet Season of the Year, when no good Fermentation can be expected or made equal to the Months between <hi>January</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust;</hi> so that the Excuse must be Idle, that may be alledged for making Rum late.</p>
               <p>I think I have given the Husbandman suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Time from the middle of <hi>June</hi> to the first of <hi>October,</hi> to nurse his young Crop; plant all his Provisions or rather nurse them, and prepare his Dung with holeing the 100 Acres of Land for the Crop of Canes, as he may receive great Assistance in some sorts of those Works from three Cattle-Carts, and two Horse-Carts which I recommend to be kept upon this Estate.</p>
               <p>It is necessary to reserve great Quantity of dry Trash to Litter the Pens and Stable and to make proper Shelters for the poorer Cattle in the wet Season, as they are subject to many Disorders, besides their Hoofs becoming soft, which alone will occasion a Beast to look thin as he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse the Pasture for want of Feet: And this work of raising those heaps of Trash may be
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:007356_0037_102B5DA308BCF040"/>
done immediately after finishing the Crop, by taking it off from those 40 Acres of the second Crop you reserve for Sugar, by doing which you'l give yourself Room to dig up the intermediate Spaces in that Land which must be performed in the same Manner as directed, at about ten or fifteen Days distance of Time, and continued until the large Lumps of Earth becomes pulver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized, which the Sun will very much assist to do, and until those Canes become too forward to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Repetition: shallow Land will not so well bear this as deep Land.</p>
               <p>It has frequently happen'd that in the Months of <hi>March</hi> and <hi>April</hi> in many Parts of this Island, fifty Gallons of Cane-Juice have made a ten Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon Pot of Sugar, and at some particular Places, 45 Gallons have been known to make it; which Sugar will weigh Green, 120 lb. the same after it is regularly clay'd a second Time, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly Cured will weigh from 48 to 60 lb. the difference of Weight the Still-House is charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with to the Curing-House in the several sorts of Molasses, viz. the Muscovado, the first and second clayed Molasses, as well as the Still<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>House is chargeable to the Boiling-House for the Quantity of Skimmings it receives from thence, all which Materials, as has been already 
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:007356_0038_102B5DA5F15B7F80"/>
shewn, may make eight Gallons of Rum to that Pot of Sugar.</p>
               <p>I shall proceed to fix a reasonable Valuation upon the foregoing Plantation, and the Gross Produce; and examine what Expences it will require to support it Annually. In doing which, I shall endeavour to be as regular as possible.</p>

<pb n="45" facs="unknown:007356_0046_102B5DB8F860D898"/>
at high Prices to yield a reasonable clear Profit to the Owner, whose considerable Expences, many Risques, and the Calamities, Losses, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, Labours and Fatigues, necessarily attending a Sugar Plantation in this Island more especially; should induce their being kept as free as possible from all Duties, Impositions and Restraints; for although in some Years the clear Profits with Frugality and good Oeconomy may be considerable, yet for want of seasonable Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and due Care, and proper Supplies, and good Management, many Plantations have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not worth holding, and there are many dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Prospects of ruinous Buildings in the Island, that were at first very Commodious, which have by various Accidents been destroyed, and only the Land been regarded as of Value by joining to other Estates.—Plantations in this Island do not yield near so much clear Profit, as those in other Sugar Colonies, which are managed more easily, at little Expence, and are more certain in their Produce.</p>
               <p>My Reason for making so large an Allowance upon the Supplies, or Repairs of the Slaves and Stock is, first supposing such a Number to dye Annually, it will require that Supply immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or oppress the remaining Number, or submit 
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:007356_0047_102B5DBA7B3666C8"/>
to unseasonable Husbandry, or to depend upon hired Labourers, which most certainly will lead you into many Difficulties and Losses. But sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose those Slaves don't dye; it is reasonable to imagine that they, as well as the Cattle and Horses must be so much the worse: For if every Planter would take an Inventory of the Value of his Slaves the first Day of <hi>February,</hi> and again the first Day of <hi>November,</hi> he would discover that difference at least in the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of 300; and so it will admit in Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a difference in the Value of the Horses and Cattle between the first Day of <hi>March,</hi> and the last Day of <hi>September.</hi> For if we see inanimate Things, such as the Utensils of the Plantation become worse, though used with the greatest Care in the Hands of the Artificers, how much more must the Constitutions of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and Animal Creatures be impaired: The Slaves in reaping the ripe Crop, nursing the Young, and planting the ensuing one, and the Stock by the Labour of reaping and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to Market? my Reason for allowing so little to the several Tradesmen is, when a set of Works and Buildings are all in Perfection, they will require very little of their Assistance for many Years, except it is for hanging the Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers 
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:007356_0048_102B5DBE3021F9C8"/>
and Stills, and that Expence will require to be repeated every four or five Years, if there is five Thousand Pots of Sugar Boiled in them.</p>
               <p>As for any Accident which every Thing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its Kind or Nature is subject to, that must be submitted to, and a Charge made for out of the Neat Proceeds (when it happens) as Profit and Loss.</p>
               <p>If any Objection should arise concerning the Number of 50 Pots per Acre with the Addition of the 40 Acres of second Crop to the 100 Acres of first Crop Canes, it would be just to try that Experiment before it is strongly opposed or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued against.</p>
               <p>If any Observation be made upon what I've said of 50 Gallons of Cain-Juice to make a ten Gallon Pot of Sugar, let it be considered that it is in the prime Months of <hi>March</hi> and <hi>April,</hi> and not throughout a Crop. I have now seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Journals by me, all which I have carefully looked over, and find upon an Average, that a ten Gallon Pot has taken 63 Gallons in one Year, and in another, 65 Gallons of Liquor; the latter being until the Month of <hi>July</hi> when 
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:007356_0049_102B5DC0513238C0"/>
finished, and doubtless if we were to keep on working through <hi>August, September,</hi> &amp;c. we may discover more considerable Loss. I have been just, as well as curious herein.—If any should object to a 10 Gallon Pot being Double<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clayed, to weigh from 48 to 60 lb. of Neat Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar; first let it be considered what it weighs green, then how liable it is to Abuse in the sort of Clay and Management of it, and how old it is too, whilst it is neglected and becomes so dry that it admits the Clay Water a sudden Passage, which carries away the Sugar into the Jarrs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much Improvement of the Colour of that it leaves in the Pot. Therefore I insist upon it, that Sugar fairly Tempered, Cleansed and Boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will be fit to receive the Clay in 12 or 15 Days, except you have Potted it colder than ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, which if not extreamly cold, may make it 20 Days, or according to the Degree it was cold: for that in itself is an Error without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, especially for Sugar you design to clay.</p>
               <p>If your Sugar is such as I have described, and has not been Injured by the Boiler, then the Sugar not being changed truly white, must be from some Error of the Clayer in the Curing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>House, from either the sort of Clay, the due 
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:007356_0050_102B5DC1D31A3E58"/>
Proportion of Water, or the due Mixing and Tempering; for Clay will require many Hours Labour and Pains to incorporate thoroughly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it goes through the Strainer to lay upon the Sugar. And it is my humble Opinion that a Miscarriage is often owing to the want of Care in this Particular.</p>
               <p>The several Remarks I have herein made, if they are candidly and duly considered, will, I humbly presume to hope, incite the Owners of Estates to provide for them effectually in every respect, and in some Measure assist them, in knowing more readily, when Plantations are well and properly managed.—Prompt chief Overseers, and all employed in Plantations, to do their respective Duties, in the most honest, faithful, diligent, careful and exact Manner; and to enlarge and improve on the Hints offer'd in this Treatise.—And if a laudable Emulation can be raised in every one to exert himself in the best Manner he is able, for the Benefit and Improvement of a Sugar Plantation; possibly my Endeavours in this Work, will escape all ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natured, inconsiderate Criticisms, or any Conceits, that it may be in any Respect the least Prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, and may be commended, and my kind ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous

Subscribers, not blame me for what I have here produced to publick View; but should all my own Observations be deemed merely Trifling and Insignificant, surely the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexing some most useful excellent Instructions, given many Years ago, by HENRY DRAX <abbr>Esq</abbr> for the Management of his two Plantations in this Island, will render my Treatise valuable, as those Instructions can't be too much admired, considered, and practised by every worthy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Planter, or Master of an Estate, and therefore I do with Pleasure publish the Copy I procured of them.</p>

            <head>INSTRUCTIONS For the Management of Drax-Hall, and the Irish-hope Plantations: TO Archibald Johnson,</head>
            <byline>By HENRY DRAX, <abbr>Esq</abbr>
            </byline>
            <p>I Shall insert some general Rules and Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, which I have walked by my self, for the Government of the Family both Whites and Black.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the first Place, I must enjoin you, and 'tis my positive Directions, that every <hi>Sunday,</hi> all the Family of Whites be called in to hear <hi>Morning</hi> and <hi>Evening Prayers;</hi> and of other Days, if you have Time and Conveniency. Let a Penalty be put on the absent, either the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of their Allowance that Week, or what other, you think fit.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="52" facs="unknown:007356_0053_102B5DCA57579600"/>
2. On your first entring upon the Estate, I would have an exact Inventory taken of all Things on the Plantation, a true Copy of which must be sent me.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For your greater Ease, and that you may not be taken off from solely minding the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation Affairs of planting and making Sugar, and that you may have as little Occasion as possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, of being absent from the Plantation, which I have experimentally found, to be very perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to all Proceedings there, every Person be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more diligent in his Employ, when the Master is at home, although he stirs not out of his Chamber, than when he is abroad; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it must be observed for a Rule, that you never be absent from the Plantation, but in Case of Necessity: I say for your greater Ease, I have engaged proper Persons to act in, and do all my Business in <hi>Bridge-Town.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. I hope you will find a sufficient breeding Stock for the plentiful furnishing your Table; but if you find there are not ten good breeding Cows, twelve good laying Turkey Hens, eight Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy Ducks, eighteen good Dunghill Hens, all to be kept for a breeding Stock; then I wou'd have you buy of each Sort to make up the Number.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="53" facs="unknown:007356_0054_102B5DCBDD2EE2E0"/>
5. It is my Desire, that not only for the more comfortable Support of your self, and those of my Family as shall eat at Table with you, but also for the Relief of all such, either Whites or Blacks as shall be sick in the Family, that you keep a plentiful Table; for the furnishing of which, I do allow you, the Produce of all the Sheep, Hogs, Turkeys, Dunghill Fowls, Ducks, Pidgeons, &amp;c. none of which shall you ever sell. You must be careful not to be overstocked, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in Sheep, which are great Tainters, and Destroyers of the Pastures, and consequently very injurious to Cattle; fourteen Ews of the best Sort, will be enough, to keep for breeding, the Ewe Lambs of which must be constantly killed, and the rest made Weathers, and killed as you have Occasion. I wou'd have the Sheep constantly kept at the <hi>Hope-Plantation</hi> for mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Dung there.</p>
            <p n="6">6. For your Supply of <hi>Maderia</hi> Wine, Salt, Spice, Oatmeal, salt Provisions, and other Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries that must be bought for House-keeping, I do not think fit to stint you, being confident of your Moderation and careful Frugality in the Use of them; besides, I know not what Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion there may be, of more than ordinary Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences 
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:007356_0055_102B5DCE673300F0"/>
for drenching of Horses and Cattle, and for the Relief of sick People, whom I earnestly desire may not want any Thing that's fit for them; the Kitchen being more useful in raising and recovering of Negroes in most Distempers than the Apothecary's Shop; they do well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, but Physick alone without proper Care, and the Help of what the Kitchen affords, does rather injure or destroy, than assist Nature, but I have so great a Confidence in your more than ordinary Care in this Particular, that I shall not further enlarge upon it.</p>
            <p n="7">7. For your Supply of Beer, I shall give Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections that twice or thrice every Year two Hog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheads of the best Strong Beer be sent you from <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. My Attorneys must be invited by you to view the Plantations once a Year, when they must be well entertained, and you must desire them carefully to inspect every Thing, and shew them all Accounts relating to Plantation-affairs, and acquaint them with all your Schemes and Intentions for the Management and Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Estate, and their Directions and Advice I would have you to observe and follow.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <pb n="55" facs="unknown:007356_0056_102B5DCFEA60A9D0"/>
9. I wou'd have to eat at the Table with you, the Person who keeps the general Waste-book and Account of making and dispatching of Rum: The Doctor; the chief Accomptant or Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Keeper; and also the Head-Curer.</p>
            <p n="10">10. You must sometimes, the oftner the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, call your white Overseers together, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise and discourse them about the Plantation-Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; as about what Pieces of Canes or Corn &amp;c. do most want Weeding; what is the next properest Work to fall on; how Canes or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions stand in such a Piece or Part of the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; whether the Watchers of them do their Duty; whether there is any Dung to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided or saved; or what other Questions you shall think fit to ask them. Besides, the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage you'l receive in hearing their several Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, it may give you Information of some Things, which otherwise you might have been ignorant of, and certainly bring several Matters into your Remembrance. You'l by this Means improve all their Judgments in the Affairs of the Plantation, and make them far more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent than they would otherwise have been.</p>
            <p n="11">11. It will be necessary to encourage the white Servants according to their Merits, either 
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:007356_0057_102B5DD20D63F2B0"/>
by an extraordinary Allowance of Cloaths or Provisions, or if you see Cause, of some Wages.</p>
            <p n="12">12. The Doctor must be very skilful, diligent, and humane, for the utmost Care should be taken of all the Sick, many of whom will yearly die if they want good Kitchen Physick, and good looking after.</p>
            <p n="13">13. You must never punish to gratify Anger or Passion, the End of Punishments being to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the Malefactor, and to terrify others from committing the like Faults. A wise prudent Man will not be passionate, to Servants especially, for a passionate Man is not fit to judge or to command.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Be strict in punishing all Vice, especially Drunkenness, which is frequently the Original of all others, and it is a Vice the Whites are much addicted to; the Stocks or laying them Neck and Heels till they are sober and sensible of their Faults, I have observed to be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perest Punishment for the Crime, Blows gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally enrages a drunken Man and makes him fit for any Mischief.</p>
            <p n="15">15. If at any Time you take Notice of a Fault 
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:007356_0058_102B5DD4CBE63038"/>
you design to punish, let it be immediately ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, especially upon Negroes, many of them chusing to kill themselves to avoid Correction.</p>
            <p n="16">16. The Blacks are commonly addicted to Thieving; if it be for their Belly, it is the more excusable, but I hope none of mine will ever have Occasion to be Thieves for Want; but if at any Time they are taken stealing Sugar, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasses, or Rum, they must be severely handled.</p>
            <p n="17">17. There must be the greatest Care imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able taken to preserve all Portable Things from being stolen.</p>
            <p n="18">18. The Curer has a very great Trust com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his Charge, therefore you must be very careful to employ not only a skilful and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Man, but also one that's sober and honest. In order to keep him so, he should be above conversing with the ordinary Servants, for which reason I wou'd have him eat at Table with you, by which Means also you'l have a more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Opportunity of discoursing with him, and giving him Directions about his Business. You must frequently view his Accounts, also daily see all his Sugar in every Bay. This Diligence of yours will make him fearful of erring by 
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:007356_0059_102B5DD767867050"/>
Neglect or otherwise, well knowing it must be discovered. The Curer must take particular Care to have all the Pots prick'd in the Boiling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>House before brought into the Curing-House; he must look to the Jarrs the Pots are set on, that they be both tight and very sweet; in set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them up to sort the high boiled Pots from the low, and if there happens to be any very bad Pots in the Parcel to put them by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; but I hope by your Care in the Boiling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>House such Mistakes will seldom happen. The Sugar being good and boiled to it's true Heighth, will be ready to break and level in five or six Days Time, which must not be neglected, for the sooner it is knocked out, the sooner it will be Shipped, and the Pots ready to fill again.—There must great Care be taken in setting the Pots level and right for claying, and emptying all the Jarrs of the Molasses, that every Pot may have it's empty Jarr to purge into after being clayed. For such Sugar as happens to be high boiled or bad, you must judge of the time of claying by knocking the Pots out, and if you find them purge three Quarters through, you may immediately level and clay them. As soon as the first Clay is dry, take it off, and let the Sugar the second Time be levelled. You must 
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:007356_0060_102B5DD8EC1C4C20"/>
chuse for claying Sugar a stiff Clay, and such as shall be free from Gravel, Earth, &amp;c. The Negroes must work the Clay well and strain it through a Cullender, and make it either a thiner or thicker Batter according to the Firmness or Softness of the Sugar that it's to be laid on. If the Sugar be strong and high boiled, it will endure a very thin Batter. Observe for a Rule, that all Sugars whatsoever be clayed both Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covado and Paneels, except some Paneels prove bad and too weak to bear a Clay, in such Case you must only Sun dry such Sugar to pay away. For the Time of knocking out Sugar there is no certain Rule; the usual Time is about six Weeks or two Months after claying, but the best Way to be certain, is to knock out several Pots of those Bays that are oldest, and if you find it clear to the Bottom, it's fit to be knock'd out. In knocking out, there must be great Care taken, if the Sugar comes out with Difficulty, as it generally does from new Pots; it must be knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out upon Canvis quilted for that Purpose, and Sometimes dug out to preserve the Pot from breaking. Let your clayed Muscovado be sorted into three or four Sorts according to the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of it, in which your Head-Curer must be very nice and exact, especially of the white Sorts: 
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:007356_0061_102B5DDD6C95E8F0"/>
and Paneels into two Sorts, and afterwards very well dryed, for which Purpose you'l find Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies to dry five thousand Pounds Wt. a Day. It will be the Curers Care to see the Casks he packs the Sugar in, be strong and clean; <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e must be exact in tareing the Casks, which Tare must be put on several parts of the Cask with Chalk. Let every Sort of Sugar be weighed in Bags as it is brought from the <hi>Barbacue,</hi> which Weight must be put in a Book kept for that Purpose, as also all Sugar daily knock'd out; what Number of Pots; that your knocking out may agree with your weekly Receipts of Pots. Your Curer must be very careful in Packing, that he makes no Mistakes or false Package. Let the Sugar both by ramming and shaking the Cask be as close packed as possible. Besides, comparing the Sorts in packing, the several Sorts must be expressed with Chalk on the Outsides of the Cask. Let all the Sugar (except the Paneels that's bad) be packed up in Casks at the Plantation, and fitted for Shipping before it be sent to the Bridge. As soon as the Casks are filled, let them be headed up and number'd, and immediately Weighed and Tared, and the Sort of Sugar contained in each Cask must be immediately enter'd in a Book kept for that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose 
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:007356_0062_102B5DDEEEB64080"/>
This the Curer must have a particular Charge to be careful in, that there be no Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the Weights when the Sugar arrives at <hi>London.</hi> As the Sugars are carted to the Bridge, let the Number be expressed in the Book, that you may at any Time know what is sent down.—All Sugar Pots, Jarrs, and all other Necessaries belonging to the Curing-House, must be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the Curer by Inventory, for which he must be accountable as follows; for all Pots or Jarrs he delivers out to the Boiling-House, or for any other Use, he must charge the Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Boilers, or other Persons, who must when that Occasion is serv'd for which they were deliver'd, return them again, and be discharged. These Accounts must be kept in a Book, in which must be inserted all that are broken, the Day when, and by what Accident.</p>
            <p n="19">19. For the better Preservation of Plantation Tools and Necessaries, I would have a Room set apart on Purpose to keep them in, which must be divided into small Partitions, for the more orderly keeping each sort apart. In this Room, where all those Necessaries are kept, there must be an exact Account of what's deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered out of this Store for Use, as Hoes, Crows, 
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:007356_0063_102B5DE23A33CF90"/>
Wedges for splitting Wood, or Stone Axes, Hatchets, Crosscut-Saws, Skimmers, Basons, Ladles, Straining-Cloths, and all other of the Plantation Necessaries. Whatever is in this Store, charge one of your White-Servants that can Write with, who, in some Book, where a List of the same Things must be kept, must mention, what White or Black by Name, he delivers any of these Particulars to; which when return'd back, must be expressed at the End of every Line, but if not returned, then the said white Receiver, must immediately acquaint you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, that you may enquire into the Matter. The oftner you inspect all these Accounts, the more careful you will make the Parties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. All Tradesmen's-Tools, with other Things not before mentioned, have formerly been kept in the Store-House, by the Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper, and the several Persons concern'd, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with all Things deliver'd, who are account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for the same.</p>
            <p n="20">20. Be sure you keep all the Houses in the Plantations in good Repair, as a short Neglect in this, will treble the Charge and Trouble.—You must take such convenient Opportunities to Repair or erect Buildings, as not to neglect 
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:007356_0064_102B5DE4B23CDAE8"/>
even one Days Work, in either Planting, Weed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, making of Sugar &amp;c.—You should take a convenient Time when Vessels arrive from St. <hi>Lucia,</hi> and Timber is cheap, to store your self.—Timbers kept in the Plantations as a Reserve, must be Housed and kept dry, and often viewed, lest the Wood-Lice get to them, as they at Times do much Damage to Timber, especially to Locust and Sweet-Wood.—I would have no Timber bought except on absolute Necessity, or that you can meet with it very cheap.—Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the young Mastick Trees for making Mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points, as they answer this Use very well.—You should always have a good Stock of Laths lying by you Seasoning, to be ready on Occasion. Sweet-Wood hath generally been made use of in this Plantation: You must try smooth and strait Grain Mastick, which I believe may do well for Laths.—Have always ready at each Plantation for fear of any Accident by Fire, one long Ladder, and two or three shorter, these may be hung against the Wall to the leeward Side of the Stoke-Holes at the Hope, where un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Eves they'll be preserved dry, and in the old Cattle-Mill at <hi>Drax-Hall</hi> Plantation. Let it be a Rule that whoever takes them from thence for any Use, that they return them back again.</p>
            <p n="21">
               <pb n="64" facs="unknown:007356_0065_102B5DE6D9C04518"/>
21. You must be very careful in the Choice of your Field Overseers, who must besides having a good Command, be very active, diligent, and ingenious, if possible, honest; Negroes so qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified under your Directions, will quickly make able Overseers, as it will be your Part to see that there be not too much Severity, or Lenity used by them. Negroes upon their first having a Command are very apt to be severe, which must be strictly guarded against, for I have found it easier to abate the Courage of obstinate Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, than to raise the Spirits of one that hath been dejected by hard or severe Usage.—There must also be great Care taken to prevent Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality in the black Overseers.</p>
            <p n="22">22. There must be especial Care taken in working the Hands, that every Negro doth his Part according to his Ability, the weak Hands must not be pressed, nor the Strong suffered to shrink from their Work. Many Negroes will be apt to Lurk and Meech from their Work, without great Care be taken to prevent it.</p>
            <p n="23">23. The best Way that I know of to prevent Idleness, and to make the Negroes do their Work properly, will be upon the change of Work, constantly to Gang all the Negroes in the Plantations in the Time of Planting. All the 
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:007356_0066_102B5DE929696120"/>
Men Negroes into two Gangs, the ablest and best by themselves for Holeing and the stronger Work, and the more ordinary Negroes in a Gang for Dunging, &amp;c. The Women Negroes also into two Gangs as before, and the lesser Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes into two Gangs, the least to be followed by some careful old Woman, who must use them with Gentleness. Out of these six Gangs of Negroes must the Carters, Stillers, Curing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>House Negroes, Cooks, Lookers after Stock, Watchers of Provisions, &amp;c. be drawn. Your Under-Overseer must constantly have a List of the Gang under his particular Care, that he may be able to give a particular Account of every one, whether Sick or how employed. In the Time of grinding Canes after your Watches for your Mills, Boiling-House, and Cane-cutting Gangs are taken out, all the rest of the Negroes, except the smallest Gangs, must be Listed into a running Gang for getting Home and Houseing all sorts of Fuel. The Reason why all the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes are to be Listed is, because other Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are uncertain, and when there is no Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion for Negroes to be in the Still-House, Curing-House, &amp;c. then they must constantly make their Appearance in the running Gang, of which when the Number is great, it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to have two Overseers, and the able Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes 
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:007356_0067_102B5DEBAC7E0B90"/>
divided from the weaker. This Method will be most effectual to prevent lazy Negroes absenting from their Work.—I had commonly every Fortnight, and sometimes oftner, a List brought me where every Negro in the Plantation was employed; which Custom will be for your Ease and Satisfaction to continue.</p>
            <p n="24">24. For the enabling Negroes to go through their Work with Chearfulness, there must be great Care taken that they have Plantation Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions enough, besides the constant Provision<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Ground of their own. The Quantity and the most convenient Place for the Negroes Gardens you must allot, which should be in the out Skirts of the Plantation. Besides enough of Plantation Provisions, which the Negroes must not by any Means want for their most comfortable Support; every Negro must have Weekly, one Pound of Fish or Mackrel. Overseers and Head-Boilers must have double that Allowance: And every Negro must have two Quarts of Molasses Week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or more if needful: and twice or thrice a Year or oftner if you see Occasion, when To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco is cheap, two or three Hundred Weight must be bought and distributed amongst all the Negroes, who must be furnished with Salt whenever they want it. Twice or thrice a Year 
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:007356_0068_102B5DEE19D84D70"/>
give a Barrel of Palm-Oyl if easily to be procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, amongst them. Once every Year supply the Men-Slaves with Drawers, Shirts, Jackets and Monmouth Caps; and the Women with Petticoats, Jackets and red Caps. For Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to particular Negroes, give what you think fit. In wet Weather give Rum to each Negro every Morning; and at other Times as you shall see convenient, according to their early Rising, or the Work they are about.</p>
            <p n="25">25. If you don't find a sufficient Number of working Negroes to carry on conveniently the Business of the Plantations to the Heighth, you must prudently buy a proper Number at a Time; I do not think it at all profitable to buy Lot Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes. I suppose to supply the Place of those that shall be decayed or dye, you'l want a Yearly Recruit of ten or fifteen, or it may be (if by any contagious Distemper there happens a great Mortality, which I beseech the great GOD of his Mercy to keep you from) twenty or more may be wanting, which must be supplied. Let all you buy, be choice young Negroes who will be fit for present Service. I have observ'd the Caramantines, and Gold-Coast Slaves, have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways stood and proved best on my Plantations, therefore you'l do well rather to buy those than of any other Sorts.</p>
            <p n="26">
               <pb n="68" facs="unknown:007356_0069_102B5DF24024D5B0"/>
26. The Horses you'l find on the Plantations, with those you carry with you, will I hope, be sufficient to make up two good Teams; if not, by <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ing these make up at least that Number, which I suppose will (besides working on Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion i<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Plantations) be sufficient to carry down all my Sugar to <hi>Bridge-Town:</hi> Horses, if sober careful Men do not attend them, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to many Casualties.</p>
            <p n="27">27. You know <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>y well the Necessity of a good Stock of working Cattle for carrying on the Plantation-Busin<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>; and that no Cattle do so well on my Plantations, as those bred on them, therefore there must be especial Care tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in the raising of Calves. I have observ'd, that the best Way is to let them run with the Cows, and have all the Milk, by which Means they become more hardy and large; therefore I wou'd not have above three Cows kept for the Pail; the rest for breeding, which sometimes when they are not big, or have Calves sucking, may also in Case of Necessity be work'd. I wou'd have a good Bull kept for the Cows. I have observ'd if Cattle have Food enough, they can't be over work'd, especially in the dry Time when the Roads are good, therefore must en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join you to be extraordinary careful of having

all the Cattle kept in good Pastures all Day, and fully Meated at Night, especially the working Cattle, which ought to have Corn allowed them, particularly in the wet Time of the Year; there is a great Conveniency by feeding of Cattle with Cane-tops, Abundance of which on the Pens, makes a great Quantity of good Dung. When you have decayed Cattle that are old and past Labour, I wou'd either have you seed them or sell to the Butchers (at which Time you may reserve a roasting Piece for your own Use) or in Case you can't conveniently feed them, you may sell them lean, but put none forth to the halfs.—A sure Way to know when Cattle are well and sufficiently Meated at Night is, when you find Cane-tops next Morning in several Parts of the Pen untouch'd; if Cattle are Neglected they will dye of the Murrain, which follows Poverty and Hunger in Cattle.</p>
            <p n="28">28. Besides your particular Care of visiting the Stable frequently when the Horses are at home, you must have an especial Care to get honest and able Carters, whom as much as may be, must be kept from the Acquaintance of Carters on the Road, who are generally very idle Fellows, and apt to spoil by their bad Examples, those that otherwise would be honest.</p>
            <p n="29">
               <pb n="70" facs="unknown:007356_0071_102B5DF545BC5E58"/>
29. You will find the Asses useful to you on many Occasions, especially for bringing Wood up the Hill into Places proper for the Carts. Great Care must be taken of the Asses, and diligent and skilful Drivers provided for them.</p>
            <p n="30">30. For the beginning of the Crop you must lay Mold 1 &amp; ½ Foot thick all over the Hole, that is every Year made Use of for that Purpose adjoining to the Still-House, over which spread the Ashes from the Stoke-Holes, and let into it the Liquor from the Stills when no longer fit to be return'd into the Cistern, which Liquor when it has overflown the whole Place, and lain so two Months, the Dung should be taken out and laid into a convenient Place for Carts to load; thus by twice digging, the Earth and Ashes will be very well mixed together. This by certain Experience I know to be excellent Manure for Canes, and being repeated three or four Times a Year, will produce great Quantities of Dung, which if you have time should be carted into the Pieces you intend to use it in, before the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of the wet Weather comes in, at which Time neither the Cattle or Horses can do half as much even with double toiling; and for the greatest ease of Carting, all the bad Places in the most used broad Paths of the Plantation, should 
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:007356_0072_102B5DF7D2D2F840"/>
at convenient Times be well mended with great Stones, or what other Way you shall think most convenient.</p>
            <p n="31">31. Your next Care must be to produce good Piants, of which you must have for both Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations at least Twenty Acres every Year; for this you must make use of the best and newest Land in the remote Parts of both Plantations.</p>
            <p n="32">32. There is no producing good Canes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dunging every Hole, therefore it must be one of your chiefest Cares to provide sufficient Quantities of Dung every Year. At <hi>Drax-Hall</hi> you'l seldom want Dung for those Pieces that lye nigh the Work, for besides the Still-House and Stables, the Cattle fed at home, where are also Hogstyes, which Places by often Trashing will afford much Dung; and for remote Pieces, I would have a Lime-kiln built at the Bottom of the old House, that being nigh great Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of Stone and the greatest Part of the Wood, where you may burn Lime very easily, which being carried to the Land where you intend to use it, and there mix'd in a Bed with Bottom Earth, or rather Loom (which is to be found in many Bottoms) where it is to lye some Time till it be dissolved, and the Loom become mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. I am told and am very confident, this 
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:007356_0073_102B5DFCD7A7FFF0"/>
Method will make very excellent Manure for Land, and the cheapest you can use for Land that lies at a Distance from the Works. This Conveniency you'l want at the <hi>Hope,</hi> there being little or no Wood, which must therefore be otherways supplied by your Industry.</p>
            <p n="33">33. I do suppose two Hundred Acres of Canes to be as little as you ought to plant well in both Plantations every Year; the best Way for plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to my Observation, is in Rows of four Feet and half Distance; this Space betwixt the Rows will give the Holers Room enough to make large and deep Holes, which must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly done.</p>
            <p n="34">34. The Dung-Carriers are to lay a large Box or Basket well heaped up with Dung be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt every two Holes, which by the Planters, after they have prepared a good Bed in the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of each Hole, and carefully placed the Plants, must equally divide and spread over the Plants of the two adjoining Holes, which must again be cover'd slightly with Mold.</p>
            <p n="35">35. In the planting Bottoms you must observe to raise Beds of every two Rows of Canes, by which Means there will be Gutters to convey the Water to the Trench that must lead to the 
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:007356_0074_102B5DFE5A58B488"/>
Hole you have dug in the lower Part of the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom amongst the Rocks for the drawing the Water off; without this Course be taken you'l not get Canes to grow in Bottoms, which gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally is the best Land.</p>
            <p n="36">36. The Planters must observe at first plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (especially if the Season be very wet) not to cover their Plants too thick, which often kills or choaks the Plants, and when they are in a flat or level Piece of Land where the Water doth not quickly drain off, they must be directed to make the Bed to lay the Plants on, at least level with the Top of the Earth, otherwise if the Plants be not quite killed, they will be so chilled with the Water that lies in the Hole, that the Cane will never thrive.</p>
            <p n="37">37. After you have taken Care to Hole, dung, and plant well, it will be Labour lost, unless you take Care to keep the Land clean; therefore let it be observed for a Rule, that rather than let the Weeds in any Part of the Plantation run to ripe Seed, that you leave all Works whatever and go to weeding; one Month's Neglect thereof will double your Labour, and especially in Provision<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Land.</p>
            <p n="38">38. In weeding of young Canes after they are well come up, I have found it very beneficial to 
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:007356_0075_102B5E019C9EFEF0"/>
draw the Banks of Mold and Trash that lie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Rows over the Stocks of the Canes; there must be Care taken they be cut very close to the Ground, especially such as you let stand for another Crop, otherwise they'l spring up too thick, and come to nothing but Trash.</p>
            <p n="39">39. Before you begin to grind Canes be careful to have all the Mills well fixed, besides which, there should be a spare Sett of Points and Arms well fixed and tarred at each Work, lying by to be ready on Occasion; also you must have spare Coggs for the Mills, and at least one spare Sett of Sails to change upon Occasion, if those up should want mending, by doing of which in Time, the Sails will be much preserv'd and last much longer.</p>
            <p n="40">40. Be sure that all Beds of the Mills, Cis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns, and Gutters be very tight, which must be kept very sweet and clean, whilst you are at work, by often washing and scalding to avoid tainting the Liquor.</p>
            <p n="41">41. You must be sure to place at the Mills, such Feeders, as by their Care, Diligence and Skill, shall make the best Use of the Wind, so as not to loose, if possible, the Opportunity of grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Cane, for if the Feeders do their Part, all the other Negroes belonging to the Work must 
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:007356_0076_102B5E0320AE4988"/>
do theirs, therefore you must have for each Work a diligent Overseer of the Mills, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides seeing all the Negroes do their Duty, must be very careful to keep the Mills in the Wind, the Sails in good Trim, and the Gudgeons, Shafts, Collars, and Coggs very well greased, of which you must never be unprovided.</p>
            <p n="42">42. If there be never so great Diligence used to provide a great Crop, yet if there is either Neglect, or Want of Skill in the Boiling-House, the Profit will be little, therefore the greatest Care imaginable must be there used, and the most of your Time be there spent. It is the chief Part of a good Planter to be well skilled in the best Method of dispatching and making great Weeks Works, and also in true tempering, cleaning, and ordering the Liquor for making good Sugar.</p>
            <p n="43">43. Be careful before you begin to Work that every Thing be in good Order in the Boiling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>House; the Coppers all well hung and in good Repair, and well faced with Lead, which must be very thick: That your Coolers, Basons, Skimers and Ladles are in good Repair.</p>
            <p n="44">44. You must provide good Store of Fuel against you begin. Lime enough for the Crop, 
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:007356_0077_102B5E06C5029BA8"/>
and all the Ashes you can save or procure from the Pot-House.</p>
            <p n="45">45. All the Coppers and Leaden Beds must be scowered and washed clean, and so kept by scow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering and scraping as often as you have Occasion.</p>
            <p n="46">46. There must be Care taken in clarifying, that the Liquor has its due tempering; if there be a Mistake in the clarifying, it is hard to be rectified in the rest of the Coppers, therefore the Head-Boiler of each Work must have a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Care of clarifying, and upon their Neglect to be severely punished.</p>
            <p n="47">47. The Coppers being well hung, if you have good Fuel, each Copper will require a Negro, who must be very diligent and industrious to skim every Copper as the Liquor passes along to the skipping Tatches. If the Liquor hath its due Proportion of Temper at first, and the Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers boil well, by often beating the Liquor down, the Filth will rise, that the Syrrup may be made very clean, without dashing of Temper in the smaller Coppers, which the Negroes cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly use, therefore must never be done, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out your self, or the Head-boiler finds it necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. When it comes to the third Copper from the skipping Tatch, the Liquor must be well 
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:007356_0078_102B5E08488C8D88"/>
strain'd, and by all Means be made clean, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it will never purge well and turn white under Clay. In the Skipping there must be great Care in the exact Heighth; if it happens to be low there is great loss, an error on the other side is more excusable; the greatest Inconveniency of being a little too high is, that the Sugar will take a little longer Time in curing.</p>
            <p n="48">48. The Head-boiler's Care will be also to see the Sugar potted in due Time, if it is potted somewhat too hot it may be remedied by stiring in the Pot, the Inconveniency of potting cold is without Remedy, therefore not to be suffer'd.</p>
            <p n="49">49. It will be the Potters Care to have all the Pots very well washed, and if new, well soaked, and just before the potting to wet the Inside very well with Temper, otherwise the Pot will be in great Danger of breaking by the difficult knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Sugar.</p>
            <p n="50">50. As soon as the Sugar in Pots is grown cold and hard, it must immediately be set on Jarrs, the Neglect of which will be injurious to the Sugar.</p>
            <p n="51">51. It will be convenient every Morning to clear the Boiling-House by carrying all the Pots of Sugar that have been set upon Jarrs into the Curing-House.</p>
            <p n="52">
               <pb n="78" facs="unknown:007356_0079_102B5E0ABAAB4980"/>
52. All Negroes being much addicted to Steal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to prevent their p<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lfering Sugar or Molasses out of the Boiling-House, the Overseer of each Work should constantly keep the Door shut and the Key in his Pocket, more especially if he is obliged to be out of the Boiling-House.</p>
            <p n="53">53. When you are at full Work, return the Skimmings of the Tatches and adjoining Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers into the Clarifiers, but if the Mill furnish Liquor but for Par<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the Coppers, you must clarify and boil the Skimmings by themselves, or with Molasses. The Skimmings of the great Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers must be thrown down to the Still-House; the Gutters that lead to the Still-House must be kept in good Repair, and very often in the Time of working inspected, least they should be stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, which by Reason of thick Skimmings from the Clarifiers that are flung down, is very apt to be done.</p>
            <p n="54">54. The Wood Stokers who have most lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure should be charged with keeping the Gutters leading to the Still-House clean and open, and punished if not careful.</p>
            <p n="55">55. The Still-House if well taken Care of, brings very considerable Profit with little charge, therefore must be diligently minded. I hope you will find the Still-Houses well fitted with Cis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns, 
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:007356_0080_102B5E0C43DE4BA0"/>
Stills, Worms, Pumps, Gutters, and all other Necessaries, all which must be constantly kept in good Order and well fixed.</p>
            <p n="56">56. Your Stillers must not only be skilful in the quick preparing and fitting the Liquor, but must be also very diligent to take it at the exact Time, and active in running it off with great Expedition. It is by this Means that great Quantities of Rum is made. If at any Time you have a Servant that's fit to undertake the important Charge of an able Distiller, it will be necessary that you allow him some yearly Sum for his Encouragement according to his Merit. All Necessaries belonging to the Still-House, as Tubs, Pails, Anchors, with all other Casks and Jarrs, are to be delivered to the Charge of the Stiller, who is to be accountable for them in like Manner as the Curer.</p>
            <p n="57">57. As the Rum is daily sent up, let an exact Account be kept of it in a Tally, and every Week the Stiller must take the Rum-Keeper's Receipt in a Book, which is to be kept for that Purpose. Let the Rum be disposed of, and an Account kept thereof.</p>
            <p n="58">58. Your Stiller must observe for a Rule, that if at any Time he hath Occasion to be absent or asleep, he then have the Still-House Door lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and the Key in his Pocket to prevent the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes 
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:007356_0081_102B5E1079BE0350"/>
thieving, which they never miss any Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of doing.</p>
            <p n="59">59. After the first Crop Canes are all broke, which is possible, should be finished before the wet Seasons set in, and all Provision Land clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and planted; the next Work must be to fit the Cane Land for planting, and prepare Dung. The remote pieces that will be least dung'd ought to be first planted, that they may have all the timely Seasons to grow in. After your first Crop Canes are finished your second Crop may be play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, so that you ought not to neglect the proper Season for planting, for the Sake of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little Sugar at so great a Disadvantage as you must do, if you work in wet Weather; besides, there is no great Fear of having sufficient Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals of dry Weather, during the Seasons of Rain, as to give you an Opportunity to run out your second Crop, but if it shou'd happen otherwise, I shall not think it a Disadvantage, except you should want the Land for planting, or the Pieces lye so, that it will much disorder the Method you have designed, to have forty or fifty Acres of second Crop left to begin the next Crop with.</p>
            <p n="60">60. The Cistern for receiving Molasses must be bept very clean and sweet, and the Molasses boiled up, if possible, every Week. If by grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you are hinder'd of that, you must boil it as 
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:007356_0082_102B5E130316C198"/>
often as you possibly can with conveniency, for the fresher the Syrrups are the better will the Pancels be.</p>
            <p n="61">61. When you have Time, let every Sugar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Pot be well hoop'd; to keep the Hoops on, they should with Monjack boiled up with Lamp-Oyl to a convenient Heighth, be daubed over.</p>
            <p n="62">62. You will constantly have Occasion for four Wain Tumbrels, and two Horse Tumbrels, one Horse Cart and a Waggon, for the Plantation Use, which must be constantly kept in good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair; and when not in Use, be housed. For the continual maintaining of these, you must have two Pair of Wheels lying by ready fitted, Velloes, Spokes, and Axle-trees ready hewn for five or six Pair more; and some Quantity of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber fit for Cart Spokes will be much wanting.</p>
            <p n="63">63. If the Moon shines in the beginning of the Night, dispatch your Carts about 3 o'Clock in the Afternoon; and if it shines the latter Part of the Night, dispatch them from the Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about 2 in the Morning, by which Means, they will avoid the Heat of the Day in their Travelling, which certainly is destructive both to the Horses and Cattle, and may prevent the Acquaintance with bad Carters.</p>
            <p n="64">64. To keep your Carters in better Awe, it will be convenient sometimes to set a Spy over 
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:007356_0083_102B5E164409D428"/>
them, and if you hear they loiter at any House by the Way, or of any other Misconduct, then punish them moderately and prudently according to the Nature of the Crime, by which Means they will be more fearful of offending: but if they approve themselves to be careful and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, give them all proper Encouragement.</p>
            <p n="65">65. I would have all my Rum sent to Town, and none sold at the Plantation, except on Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Workmen that belong to the Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and would have all Necessaries for the Estate bought by the Town Agent, therefore send to him on all Occasions for what you want; he will also ship and dispose of all my Sugars, which must be sent to him, and none sold at the Plantation, only if you should at any Time have Occasion to buy any Plantation Provisions (which I hope will happen very rarely) which will be more convenient for you to buy to save Carriage, and should be bought as near home as possible. For paying for Provisions and all Workmen, you may have Occasion to employ in the Plantations, my Town Agent will furnish you with Money. A particular exact Account must constantly be sent you by the Town Agent of all he receives from, and sends to the Plantations with the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of each Article, and of all other Particulars necessary to be known, and each Particular must 
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:007356_0084_102B5E17C9BAA190"/>
be regularly entered in a Book to be kept at the Plantation for your Discharge, and as a Charge upon him.</p>
            <p n="66">66. It is my Advice, that you yearly put some remote Cane Fields of <hi>Drax Hall</hi> Plantation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Potatoes, which being well trash'd, seldom fails of producing great Quantities of Potatoes. At the <hi>Hope</hi> Plantation put some remote Cane piece into <hi>Bonavis,</hi> which being dung'd (besides the Advantage of the Pulse) will so fit the Land for Canes against another Year, as to make it produce good Canes with indifferent Dunging.</p>
            <p n="67">67. When you want Fuel, I would have you cut the Wood and Bushes adjoining to the old Plantain Walk, some Quantity of which Land, I would have planted with Plantain Trees, in doing which, you must observe to take the Plants from the Stalks of small Plantains, that being a better Sort, and will produce the larger Bunches. Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains is a Provision the Negroes much delight in, and is a very wholesome Food, especially in Fluxes, and they produce greatly in the Years when there are no very high Winds.</p>
            <p n="68">68. As all Sorts of Provisions are subject to Casualties, some will be destroyed by Worms and Flies, and all by long Droughts, therefore 'tis my positive Directions, that you have constantly a Reserve of ten or fifteen Acres of Casavy, for fear 
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:007356_0085_102B5E19E5E54758"/>
of other Provisions failing, that being more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and will lie four or five Years in the Ground, and still improve, and therefore to be depended on. Your Casavy Pieces should be near the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Walk, that one Watch may look after both. Observe for a Rule, that as you dig the Casavy, constantly to plant the Land again, by which Means you'l never want.</p>
            <p n="69">69. There must be Care taken to plant all the Land you can, with Corn, without which neither Horses or Cattle will be able to perform their Work; and when there is no Want of Corn, every Thing in the Plantation will be fat, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very good Food for the Negroes.</p>
            <p n="70">70. Whenever you plant Corn among Canes, observe to plant the Rows at double Distance, especially if you plant <hi>Guinea</hi> Corn among Canes, in which Case you must always take Care to thin it, and not to suffer above two or three Stalks at most to grow from one Hole, otherwise it will much prejudice the Canes.</p>
            <p n="71">71. There are some Pieces in the Out-skirts of the Plantation rocky, barren, and fit for little, but <hi>Guinea</hi> Corn, which after the Corn is gathered affords good Pasture, and therefore should be planted if you have Time yearly, but for Want of your being able to do it yearly, you must take the best Care of it, for second Crop, as <hi>Guinea</hi> Corn produces a good second Crop.</p>
            <p n="72">
               <pb n="85" facs="unknown:007356_0086_102B5E1C05396AE8"/>
72. After you have fallen Land enough be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Hill, either let your new Land as you fall it, run again to Wood, or plant the like Quantity of Land in some other Part with Fid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle-Wood-Trees, which will be no Hindrance for some Years, to the planting of it at least with <hi>Guinea</hi> Corn.</p>
            <p n="73">73. Let the leeward Side of all Divisions of Canes be planted with Fiddle-Woods; you must observe to keep the young Woods for some Years after planting clean from Vines, otherwise the Growth will be extremely hinder'd, if the Wood is not quite destroyed by them.</p>
            <p n="74">74. I would have you in your Plantain-Walk, to plant as you can get the Nuts, five hundred or two thousand Palm-Oyl-Trees, and in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den at home the first Season that happens, plant five hundred sower, five hundred sweet, and five hundred <hi>China</hi> Orange Trees, and forty or fifty Shadocks, which must be planted at convenient Distances, and in strait and good Order. Plant also one hundred Citron-Trees, and one hundred sower Lemon-Trees of the best Kind.</p>
            <p n="75">75. On the first of <hi>January,</hi> I would have an Inventory taken of all Things whatsoever in the Plantation, and the same fairly entered in a Book to be kept for that Purpose called the <hi>Book of Records,</hi> in which must be also kept by Way of 
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:007356_0087_102B5E1F1E155AE0"/>
Debit and Credit, according to the Method there appointed by my Father Sir JAMES DRAX, an Account of the Increase and Decrease of the Stock (viz.) what born, bought or received, also what dead, worn out, or disposed of; in which Book must be entered a brief Account of all the Sugars, the Quantity of Pots made and knock'd out, and the Sorts, all the weekly Accounts of Rum made, and how disposed of, what is yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and how disposed of, and also an Abstract of all the Expences of the Plantation according to the Form prescribed, a Copy of all which I wou'd have sent me to <hi>London</hi> by the first Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel that sails after the first Day of <hi>January.</hi> I would also have Quarterly Accounts of the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation Debits and Credits sent me by convenient Opportunities. Also send me every Year as soon as you have done planting, the Number of the Pieces planted, according to the Plats of each Plantation, and at the same Time mention the Number of Acres you have to break the ensuing Year in every Piece, in which you must distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the first from the second Crop Canes.</p>
            <p n="76">76. I shall not further enlarge, than by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding my most hearty Prayers to the great GOD for his Blessing on all your Undertakings, and assuring you of my being your cordial and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate Friend</p>
