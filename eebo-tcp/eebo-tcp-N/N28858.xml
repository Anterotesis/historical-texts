            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>HAVING frequently had to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the accidents attendant upon miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>management, in the practice of Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifery, and having, with pain, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected upon the limited knowledge of that buſineſs among moſt of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male practitioners, I have, for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time paſt, had a wiſh, that ſome means might be adopted for the better information of thoſe neceſſary, though too much neglected, members of the community.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I conſider midwives as neceſſary, and, not only neceſſary, but indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſably
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:038477_0004_10121512AFC92398"/>
ſo, notwithſtanding the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of phyſicians, becauſe ſome wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, abſolutely refuſe having a man to attend them in their labours, or at leaſt not till they are convinced of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a critical or dangerous ſituation, and oftentimes not until they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reach of the greateſt ſkill. However indiſcreet and ill-ſounded this prejudice may be conſidered, let it be called whim, a falſe delicacy or what we will, it matters nought to me, exiſting diſtreſs, whether it ariſes from reaſon or folly, equally demands our attention; and if we cannot af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford relief by one method, it behoves us to attempt it by another. If wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men cannot be perſuaded to ſubmit themſelves to the care of male prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners, it is our duty to inſtruct fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males how to give them the neceſſary aid. That this prejudice does exiſt, and that ſome women will have none but their own ſex to aſſiſt them upon ſuch
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:038477_0005_101215143A728E10"/>
occaſions, every day's experience teaches us: and that this diſpoſition is firm and not to be overcome, the arbitrary decrees of the government of Athens clearly demonſtrate; for while with them midwives were prohibited from practiſing, the fatal ſufferings of many of their women, fully proved the futility of attempting to confine that buſineſs entirely in the hands of the men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>However ſufficient in itſelf this reaſon may be, it is by no means the only or the greateſt one for encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging the ſtudy of Midwifery with women: for even were there no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections in the mind of any to the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of male practitioners, ſtill the nature of the practice of phyſic, in this country, is ſuch, that phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans cannot afford to give up ſo much of their time from their other buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as would be neceſſarily employed
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:038477_0006_10121515C742DF18"/>
upon ſuch occaſions, for the ſmall compenſation, that the greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of citizens are able, without diſtreſſing their families, to make them. What then muſt be done? The only means to relieve the major part of the community, both from op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and from danger, in ſuch caſes, is the judicious eſtabliſhment of regularly inſtructed midwives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Beſides theſe reaſons, which are of a general application, there is an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional one for their eſtabliſhment in the country. In cities a phyſician often may, in lingering caſes, ſteal time enough from them to viſit his other patients; but, in more thinly ſettled places, the neceſſary diſtance of their patients is ſuch, as to render it impoſſible for a phyſician to practiſe midwifery with prudence, and to do juſtice to his other practice: in this reſpect, then, the aſſiſtance of mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:038477_0007_1012151A631C8E50"/>
is not merely convenient, but indiſpenſably neceſſary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>So forcibly has the propriety of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing females in the art of mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifery, impreſſed the liberal minded in Europe, that their moſt celebrated phyſicians have not failed to expreſs an "ardent wiſh that ſchools might be erected in their principal cities for that purpoſe." And the committee, in their propoſals for regulating and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the practice of Medicine in France, have carefully recommended meaſures to that effect: conſidering it as an object deſerving their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar attention.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whatever may have been the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and whatever may have been done elſewhere, no plan of the kind, as far as I can learn, has heretofore been eſtabliſhed in America: conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the midwives, with a very
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:038477_0008_10121522D86A1770"/>
few exceptions, are as ignorant of their buſineſs as the women they deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: and I much doubt whether one out of twenty of them have ever ſeen the bones that ſupport and protect the womb: indeed I cannot but ſuſpect whether ſome even know, that, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing born, a child has to paſs through a bony paſſage. The greater part of them, at leaſt as far as my enquiries have reached, having taken up the buſineſs by accident, having firſt been catched, as they expreſs it, with a woman in labour, they were forced to receive the child. Attendant ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs inſpiring confidence, they without more ado, conſider themſelves compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and become immediately eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the profeſſion. But the more diffident and conſiderate, thoſe who ſeek further information, have not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally been much better off: Books were their only helps, and books, of themſelves, are but dim lights indeed;
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:038477_0009_10121524710CC340"/>
generally rendered ſtill more gloomy by the cloud of technical obſcurity in which they are involved. To learn ſuch a handicraft buſineſs by reading alone, is like learning ſhip-building without touching timber. Can we expect, but that ſuch workers, in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occupation, muſt deſtroy more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials than their good work will ever pay for?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>How, it may be aſked, in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times, did they do? We have no account of obſtetrical ſchools, nor hear any complaint of ignorant mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives; children were born then as well as now; why may not women, without ſo much ſtudy and inſtruction, attend one another as well now as then? or, is child-birth a diſorder, that women muſt always have a ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful perſon to aſſiſt them? Probably in the early ages, before the pamper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtews of luxury had taken the
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:038477_0010_10121525F7F37C80"/>
place of the ſalutary calls of nature in diet, and before the warping tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels of faſhion had taken the lead of comfort and convenience in dreſs, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, very ſeldom, was there any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe in child-bearing, or difficulty in travail. Delivery is certainly a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural proceſs, and ſo far am I from conſidering aſſiſtance as always neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that I doubt whether the whole art of midwifery will ever compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate for the miſchief ariſing from the officious interference of ignorance in its practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Under the impreſſion of the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſiderations, in the fore part of the laſt winter, I propoſed to the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male practitioners in this city, and ſuch other women as wiſhed informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the art of midwifery, to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them a courſe of inſtruction in that buſineſs, connected with the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of their attending the practice
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:038477_0011_1012152960C41B78"/>
of the lying-in ward in the Alms-Houſe. And altho' it muſt be regret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that a great proportion of them, either from an idea of ſelf-ſufficiency, from not duly appreciating the import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their profeſſion, from indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or, poſſibly, from a dread of the retroſpect, that opening their eyes might preſent to their ſenſes, ſtill choſe to grope on in their original darkneſs. Yet, to their credit be it ſaid, a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and thoſe alſo who appeared to be among the moſt conſiderate and better informed, embraced the propoſition with alacrity, and have ſince attended to the eſtabliſhment with a punctuality and attention, worthy the high object of their purſuit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The following ſheets, beſides a ſhort ſyllabus of the lectures, contains the ſubſtance of the three concluding ones, being a ſhort recapitulation of the parts moſt material to midwives; with

                  <head>RECAPITULATION.</head>
                  <p>IN the courſe of inſtruction, that we are now about cloſing, I have endeavoured, in the moſt ſimple manner, to make the <hi>art of Midwifery,</hi> which, unfortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:038477_0042_1012159CC1526CB8"/>
like the other branches of our profeſſion, has till of late been too much cloaked by the myſtic rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh of technical phraſeology, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to your comprehenſions. I muſt now further beg your atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a ſhort <hi>recapitulation</hi> of the ſubject, wherein the moſt eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial parts will be particularly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, accompanied with ſuch <hi>cautions</hi> as in my opinion ſhould be attended to by every Midwife who would wiſh to practiſe with ſafety and ſatisfaction to their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, or reputation to themſelves.</p>
                  <p>The four firſt Leſſons, as you may recollect, and will find by adverting to the Syllabus, were chiefly confined to obſervations on the ſyſtem at large, and the animal economy in general; and this ſubject, I again repeat it, you cannot too much attend to, as no
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:038477_0043_101215A34B7113C0"/>
workman can be too well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the machine whereon and wherewith he operates. Then we attended to the <hi>peculiarities</hi> of the female ſyſtem, of whom in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral we obſerved that they were of a ſmaller ſize, and more delicate and ſenſible habit than men. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which we noticed the <hi>particular</hi> peculiarities of the ſex, <abbr>viz.</abbr> their breaſts and uterine ſyſtem, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of the womb and its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendages.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Breaſts</hi> were obſerved to be large globular bodies of glands, intermingled with fat; formed of a great number of blood-veſſels, which ſend off many little tubes to carry the milk that is ſtrained into them; theſe uniting as they paſs along, at length end in ſix or eight tubes, which, by an irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, convoluted courſe, finally ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:038477_0044_101215A6549B2968"/>
in about as many openings on the point of the nipple. The nipple is of a ſpungy nature, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to be diſtended or relaxed, ſometimes prominent and pointed, at other times flattened and even dented inwards. It is covered only by a thin ſkin, and is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with numerous little glands, which ſecrete an oily glutinous matter to defend it from being fretted by the child's ſucking, and alſo to cloſe up the mouths of the milk ducks, thus aiding their crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled form, in preventing the milk from conſtantly draining off.</p>
                  <p>In regard to the ſyſtem of the womb, in the firſt place we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved of the <hi>bones,</hi> upon which the body reſts, and which form its lower part, and conſtitute what is called the <hi>pelvis</hi> or <hi>baſon,</hi> were compoſed of the <hi>nameleſs bones,</hi> the
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:038477_0045_101215A4CE7460E0"/>
                     <hi>ſacred bone,</hi> and the <hi>rump bone.</hi> The nameleſs bones were again ſubdivided into the <hi>wings</hi> or <hi>haunch, ſeat</hi> or <hi>hip,</hi> and <hi>fore part</hi> or <hi>ſhare bones,</hi> the fore part of which laſt are joined together by an intervening griſtly ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>ſacred bone</hi> forms the back part of this compages of bones, and ſeems to be a continuation of the back bone. It is of an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular triangular ſhape, with its point downwards, hollowed, and comparatively ſmooth on its inner ſurface, but rough and rounding on its outſide. Upon its upper part the back bone reſts, and from its point is continued the little mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able rump bone.</p>
                  <p>The ſacred bone joined to the hinder edge of the nameleſs bones, forms the baſon, a juſt knowledge
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:038477_0046_101215ABF17E41F0"/>
of which we eſteemed as highly intereſting to every one concerned in the practice of Midwifery. The ridge at the upper broad part of the ſacred bone, where it joins the nameleſs bones, is met by a ridge at the baſe of the wings or flaring parts of the haunch bones, this ridge is continued to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior part or junction of the ſhare bones, where they meet and form a regular oval margin called the brim of the baſon. The longeſt diameter of this oval brim is from ſide to ſide, the ſhorteſt from fore to back part, the former being about five inches and a quarter, the latter an inch leſs. The bones below this ridge all combine in forming the hollow cavity in which the womb and its appenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, the bladder and lower end of the inteſtines, are lodged. This is called the baſon. Obſervation of
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:038477_0047_101215AEE79F3810"/>
the dry bones gives but a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adequate idea of the regularity of this cavity, but when we ſee the ligaments ſtretched from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities and corners of the ſacred and rump bones to the ſeat bones, and its whole inner ſurface lined by its proper membrane, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but admire its ſmoothneſs and regularity, ſo well adapted to the important purpoſes it is intended to anſwer. This one circumſtance of it is highly worthy of our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, that, as was juſt obſerved, the longeſt diameter of this cavity at its brim was from ſide to ſide, and the ſhorteſt from fore to hind part; in the lower aperture we find theſe proportions reverſed, here the longeſt diameter being from fore to hind part, and the ſhorteſt from ſide to ſide, or from ſeat bone to ſeat bone.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="48" facs="unknown:038477_0048_101215B687033250"/>
Of the baſon it was further ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that its depth was alſo ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular, being about ſix inches behind, four at the ſides, and two at its anterior part.</p>
                  <p>Having fixed the ſize of the baſon, as it moſt generally exiſts in females, ſubject however to ſome little variation; we proceeded to examine the ſize and ſhape of the child's head and ſhoulders, and found the greateſt diameter to be from the hind to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, the ſhorteſt from ſide to ſide, while the greateſt diameter of the body was acroſs the ſhoulders. Hence, then, we ſhould ſuppoſe, what indeed happens in natural labours, that the child's head, at its firſt preſentation, would lie with its forehead and hind head to the haunch bones, while the ears lie to the ſacred and ſhare bones.
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:038477_0049_101215B80AA693E8"/>
But as the labour advances, the head, favouring the paſſage it has to paſs through, naturally turns ſo, that, as it gets to the inferior opening of the bones, its forehead is ſunk into the hollow of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred bone, while its hind head is preſented to the junction of the ſhare bones. And further, as the depth of the baſon is by far the leaſt at its anterior part, the hind head naturally riſes from under theſe bones as it comes into the world. By the time the head is born, the ſhoulders being the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the body, are fixed acroſs the longeſt diameter of the baſon, till a ſucceeding pain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling it forward, it takes the turn and the child is born on its ſide.</p>
                  <p>We then conſidered the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether the ſhare bones ever ſeparate from each other in time
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:038477_0050_101215B991F2B618"/>
of labour? And concluded that, from their firm adheſion to each other by their cementing griſtle, rendered doubly ſtrong by the ſurrounding ligaments, the whole power of the womb, with the aid of the muſcles of the belly, did not appear adequate to that effect; and that if we ſhould admit that they poſſeſſed ſtrength ſufficient, the child's head was ſo compoſed, of various unconnected bones, as by no means to be able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the powerful reſiſtance that their firm connexion would make; we might almoſt as well conceive of a knurly log's being ſplit by a wedge of cork:—We finally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that, except in caſes of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, none of the bones of the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon had any motion upon one another, during labour, excepting the rump bone, which is generally ſtraightened out, nearly upon a
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:038477_0051_101215BF8BA13410"/>
line with the back, by the preſſure of the child's head.</p>
                  <p>The bones of the baſon we mentioned were ſometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and crooked, diminiſhing in ſome way or other the natural ſize of this cavity; we obſerved that this happened by the upper part of the ſacred bone being preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed inwards, thereby leſſening the ſhorteſt diameter of the brim of the baſon; but that in ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances the fault laid in the ſhare bones being preſſed inwards, in other caſes in the ſeat bones or lower part of the ſacred bone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing projected upwards and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Theſe deformities were ſaid <hi>ſometimes</hi> to be owing to rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic affections, and that even in women who may have previouſly borne children through a capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous baſon; but that <hi>generally</hi> the
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:038477_0052_101215C269E94B38"/>
cauſe of them were laid in early years, and was owing to rickety complaints: the bones thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming ſoftened, there appeared no difficulty in accounting for the variety of crookedneſs, from the various preſſure of the ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent body upon them in the ſtates of ſtanding, of ſitting, and of lying. It was further remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that this deformity was often accompanied by like affections in the other bones, ſo that when, with a curved back bone, the legs and thighs were alſo crooked, there was great reaſon to ſuſpect this complaint; and if delivery ſhould go on laboriouſly, it ſhould be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly attended to.</p>
                  <p>After having fully attended to the bones of the baſon, both in their ſeparate and in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected ſtate, and after having
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:038477_0053_101215C503BB23A0"/>
viewed the difference between the aperture of a natural and of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed baſon, and obſerved the great difficulty that conſequently muſt take place in labour from that circumſtance, we proceeded to examine the <hi>parts</hi> of <hi>generation</hi> in women, which, to be enabled more perfectly to deſcribe, we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into <hi>external</hi> and <hi>internal</hi> parts.</p>
                  <p>The EXTERNAL PARTS were diſcoverable without the aid of diſſection, and conſiſted of the <hi>mons veneris,</hi> which is a fatty ſubſtance lying upon the junction of the ſhare bones covered with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon integuments, ſkin, &amp;c. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued down from this on each ſide were the <hi>labiae pudendi,</hi> form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of fat covered by a doubling of the ſkin, which externally were like the ſurface of the <hi>mons,</hi> but
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:038477_0054_101215C8E111F910"/>
internally were ſmooth and red; theſe joining together again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, entirely ſurrounded the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the paſſage to the womb.</p>
                  <p>Between the two labiae pudendi, about an inch below their ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the mons, is ſituated the <hi>Clitoris,</hi> which reſembles, in ſome degree, the end of a finger; it is ſaid to have been very much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged in ſome inſtances, whence originated the idea of hermaphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dites. From this, on each ſide, are continued down, doublings of the ſkin which are called the <hi>Nymphae;</hi> they lie in the direction of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biae, and are generally concealed by them, though ſometimes they are very inconveniently elongated; they ſerve to direct the courſe of the urine, and to favour the dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of theſe parts in time of delivery.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="55" facs="unknown:038477_0055_101215CDC67BD9E0"/>
A little below the clitoris, and between the nymphae, we obſerved a ſmall projecting opening evident to the touch, which is the <hi>orifice</hi> of <hi>the Urethra,</hi> or termination of the canal which leads the urine from the bladder.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>orifice</hi> of <hi>the vagina,</hi> or the opening of the paſſage to the womb, is ſituated immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the orifice of the urethra; this opening in girls is ſurrounded and nearly cloſed by a membrane cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Hymen,</hi> which in ſome inſtances has been found entirely to cloſe the paſſage, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce complete obſtruction to the diſcharge of the menſes.</p>
                  <p>The part which lies between the junction of the labiae pudendi be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and the opening of the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, is called <hi>Perinaeum,</hi> which
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:038477_0056_101215CF4A42A9C8"/>
is naturally ſmall, but is greatly ſtretched and enlarged during de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery. To prevent this being torn, we obſerved, was the chief aid ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in a natural labour.</p>
                  <p>Of the INTERNAL PARTS, we firſt noticed the <hi>Vagina</hi> or paſſage to the womb, leading from its opening juſt deſcribed, about ſix or ſeven inches up to the womb; it is of a muſcular nature, capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of great dilatation in time of labour, and of contracting again after delivery; this, as well as the inner ſurfaces of all the other parts juſt deſcribed, is furniſhed with little glands for excreting a mucus ſubſtance for lubricating them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Womb</hi> reſembles a bell-pear, but is flattened; it is ſituated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the bladder of urine and the

lower part of the inteſtines. It is ſupported and joined to the ſides of the baſon by two <hi>broad</hi> and two <hi>round ligaments;</hi> in the doublings of the former the blood-veſſels and nerves run; the round ligaments alſo run in the duplicature of the broad ones, and paſs over the brim of the baſon, to be inſerted into the groin.</p>
                  <p>The womb we divided into <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, neck,</hi> and <hi>body.</hi> Its <hi>orifice,</hi> we obſerved, hung in the vagina look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rather towards its back part: <hi>neck</hi> half the length of the womb. Around the neck the vagina is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached, but much nearer its orifice on its fore than on its back part, giving riſe to its poſition as juſt mentioned. The cavity of the neck of the womb is very ſmall at both ends; it is furniſhed with glands for excreting a matter to
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:038477_0058_101215D60FD74858"/>
cloſe the womb immediately after conception.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>body</hi> of the womb is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what triangular; its cavity is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as large as to contain an almond; its inner ſurface, to the eye, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears perfectly ſmooth, with no obſervable opening of the veſſels that diſcharge the periodical eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation. The blood-veſſels of the womb greatly enlarge after im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnation, ſo that at their open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, where the Placenta or cake adheres, they equal the ſize of a quill.</p>
                  <p>The ſubſtance of the womb we found to be of a firm, compact nature; formed, as we obſerved, of muſcular fibres running in every direction, of blood-veſſels, nerves and lymphatics.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="59" facs="unknown:038477_0059_101215DA46180B18"/>
From the upper corners of the womb ariſe the <hi>Fallopian tubes,</hi> which are continued, in the dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and along the upper part of the flat ligaments for about three inches, when they terminate in ragged ends, which hang looſe in the cavity of the belly. The ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities of theſe tubes are ſomewhat trumpet-ſhaped, being very ſmall at their origin in the womb, but enlarge conſiderably towards their termination.</p>
                  <p>About an inch from the womb, on each ſide, a little below and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the fallopian tubes, are two ſmall, flatiſh, oval bodies called <hi>ovariae.</hi> They are alſo ſuſpended in the broad ligaments.</p>
                  <p>Having particularly examined and deſcribed theſe parts, we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards attended to the <hi>Diſeaſes</hi>
                     <pb n="60" facs="unknown:038477_0060_101215DD0ACB7168"/>
to which they were ſubject, but as it always will be moſt prudent to refer theſe things to the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a phyſician, it may not, perhaps, be any way profitable now, to repeat any thing then ſaid, in regard either to their ſymptoms, cauſes or cure.</p>
                  <p>It was obſerved to you, that every healthy woman, who was not pregnant and did not ſuckle, had a regular diſcharge from her womb, called, from the term of its period, <hi>Menſes,</hi> from the latin word ſignifying month. This diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge makes its firſt appearance at different ages in different coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; for, like their fruits, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears early in proportion to the heat of their climates: thus in ſouthern latitudes it often appears as early as the eighth or ninth year, whereas in the northern ones
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:038477_0061_101215E2F5EA71C8"/>
it is deferred to a much later pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod: with us it generally appears between the thirteenth and eight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eenth years. Not only the time of its firſt appearance is affected by the climate, but the frequency of its return, the quantity diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, and the time of its final ceſſation, are alſo all influenced thereby, it being more frequent, more profuſe, and ſooner ceaſing in proportion to the warmth of the country: with us the diſcharge is, generally, about ſix ounces, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues from three to ſix days, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns monthly, and finally ceaſes between the forty-fifth and fiftieth year.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>uſe</hi> of this diſcharge ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be for keeping the womb in a proper ſtate for conception, ſince that cannot take place either before its appearance, during its
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:038477_0062_101215E60A005D20"/>
obſtruction, nor after its ceſſation. Another uſe is to afford by its ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion, during pregnancy, a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ſupply of nouriſhment for the child.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> attending their ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularity, as well as thoſe occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the time of their final ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I ſhall wave the re-conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of here; for notwithſtanding the particular attention we paid to that ſubject, ſtill I would never adviſe you to venture to preſcribe for them, when a phyſician can be procured.</p>

                  <p>THE peculiar manner in which conception takes place, being a matter more of curioſity than of real utility, we ſhall omit at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent any attempt to inveſtigate:
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:038477_0063_101215E8E60B8468"/>
thus far, however, it may not be improper to remark, that the child receives ſome eſſential original principles from both parents; elſe why ſhould it in ſome inſtances bear ſo ſtrong a reſemblance to the father, and in others to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? And that the woman by no means ſtands in that ſecondary order, in this wonderful tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as ſhe is ſtated to do by ſome; for did ſhe <hi>only</hi> furniſh a ſafe <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle</hi> for the protection, and proper <hi>nouriſhment</hi> for the growth of the child, why ſhould it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the traits of her features in its countenance, or the colour of her ſkin upon its ſurface? Might we not as well expect horns to ſprout out on the forehead of an infant that has been brought up upon the milk of a cow, or a woolly ſkin upon him who had always been wrapped in flannel?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="64" facs="unknown:038477_0064_101215EF9BECD1A8"/>
In whatever way conception is performed, anatomy aſſures us, That it <hi>firſt</hi> takes place in the ova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, from whence it is taken up by the looſe open ends of the fallopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an tubes, and conveyed through them to the womb. That it takes this route is proved, firſt, by conception never being effected after the ovariae have been taken out, as has frequently been done by farmers on ſome of their ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals: ſecondly, by certain marks diſcoverable in theſe bodies corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponding to the number of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions the perſon has had; and laſtly, by the rudiments of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren having actually been found encloſed in them, which, from ſome obſtruction, had never got into their proper place. That from the ovariae it paſſes into the open end of the fallopian tubes, and thence conveyed into the womb,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:038477_0065_101215F14E390D60"/>
we conclude, firſtly, from not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcovered any other commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication between them; ſecondly, from children having been found in the tube itſelf, which never had reached their deſtined place; and, finally, from children having been found in the cavity of the belly, which muſt have been dropped between the ovariae and the mouths of the tubes. Generally the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception paſſes into and adheres to a part of the womb, where it is nouriſhed and grows, ſo as in about ten weeks to be as large as a hen's egg. Within the cavity of this ſubſtance, the child is diſcovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſuſpended in water by a ſmall thread inſerted into its navel.</p>
                  <p>As the conception enlarges, the part adhering particularly to the womb becomes of a ſpongy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſeemingly well calculated to
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:038477_0066_101215F2D251AE98"/>
draw blood from it. This <hi>cake (placenta)</hi> becomes, at full time, from ſix to eight inches in diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, compoſed of a great number of blood-veſſels; theſe uniting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether on one ſide, form the navel ſtring, which is in fact nothing but three blood veſſels twiſted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſerving to convey nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the child, and to keep up a circulation between it and the mother.</p>
                  <p>With the growth of the child, the womb alſo enlarges; the <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes</hi> containing the waters, ſtretch more and more; the <hi>waters</hi> themſelves accumulating, protect the child from injuries, favor its regular growth and formation, at the ſame time that they guard the mother from the pain its move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments would otherwiſe occaſion.</p>

                     <pb n="67" facs="unknown:038477_0067_101215FA331D01B8"/>
The <hi>child</hi> thus confined in the womb, differs in ſeveral reſpects from children ſomewhat advanced in age, but in none more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly than in the <hi>circulation of their blood,</hi> the <hi>ſtate of the lungs,</hi> and <hi>ſtructure of the head.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In perſons who have breathed, the whole maſs of blood paſſes regularly through the lungs and then through the body, but in an unborn child, the heart and blood veſſels are ſo modified, as not to ſend more blood to the lungs than is juſt ſufficient for their nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: hence they are much firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the lungs of thoſe who have once breathed, and will ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſink in water: after birth, the lungs being expanded by reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration, the blood is freely tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted through them, and all theſe peculiarities of the circulation are
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:038477_0068_101215FDA38959E0"/>
ſoon obliterated, with a ceſſation of the paſſage of the blood, through the navel ſtring.</p>
                  <p>The bones of the <hi>head</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joined together, and indeed not being fully formed, admit of a degree of motion, and are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently lapped over each other, and moulded in a ſurpriſing man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in laborious deliveries.</p>
                  <p>As the <hi>womb</hi> increaſes during the time of pregnancy, it firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larges at its body, and, from its increaſed weight, ſinks down into the cavity of the baſon: hence, if a woman is examined during this period, the mouth of the womb will be diſcovered lower than na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and will feel heavier to the touch: at or about the third month, the womb becoming too large to be confined within the
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:038477_0069_10121600956591D0"/>
cavity of the baſon, riſes up above its brim, and then its orifice being higher is more difficultly felt: this difficulty increaſes as the woman advances till labour comes on. During this enlargement of the womb, its neck becomes entirely obliterated, it being all ſtretched out into the general diſtention. A remarkable circumſtance of the womb is, that notwithſtanding its great diſtention, it ſuffers no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution in its thickneſs, it being no thinner at the time of delivery than before impregnation: this is owing to its becoming much more ſpongy, by the general enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of its veſſels. The ſudden contraction of the womb makes its ſides conſiderably thicker ſoon after delivery, the veſſels not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet returned to their original ſize; in a little time, however, it returns to its natural thickneſs.</p>

               <p>Theſe ſmpathetic affections ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſubſide, or at leaſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably abate, about the third month, when the womb may be diſtinctly felt riſing above the ſhare bones: this alſo, as well as the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned ſymptoms, is by no means a <hi>ſure</hi> teſt of pregnancy, and indeed there appears to be no unequivocal ſign, whereby that ſtate can with certainty be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, till between the fourth and

               <p>For the <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> of pregnancy, it certainly would be very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for midwives to be too free in preſcribing: that belongs to the province of the phyſician, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs <hi>the means of preventing the many diſorders incident to that ſtate</hi> cannot be too fully underſtood by you; for, by your friendly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, many <hi>vulgar errors</hi> may be timely counteracted, and much comfort enjoyed by the ſex during their nine months journey. No <hi>error</hi> has perhaps more generally crept in with the ſex, than the belief of <hi>all</hi> their diſorders in that ſtate, being owing to too great a quantity of blood, from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of its uſual evacuation; hence <hi>blood-letting</hi> has been ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:038477_0073_101216112AA8DE30"/>
adviſed for their relief, and by many thought neceſſary even when no complaint exiſted: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing however can be more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd; for the loſs of appetite, ſo common in the early ſtages, very little favours the redundance of blood; beſides, when we calculate the whole quantity of the menſes that would have been diſcharged for nine months, (which cannot be eſtimated above ſixty or ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ounces) and compare it with the weight of the child and its appendages, (which is, at leaſt, to three times that amount) we ſhould rather ſuppoſe that women wanted <hi>more,</hi> inſtead of <hi>leſs,</hi> blood than they have. It was a max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im with old Hippocrates, that "Bleeding produces miſcarriag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es." I do not pretend to ſay that bleeding is never neceſſary during pregnancy: its <hi>indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi>

uſe is what I wiſh to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenanced, and that it never ſhould be performed but by the particular advice of a ſkilful phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Bowels</hi> of pregnant women ſhould always be kept regular; and if they are coſtive, which is very apt to be the caſe, from the preſſure of the womb upon the lower part of the inteſtines, it ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally may be remedied or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, by the free uſe of vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and ripe fruits, and occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, if neceſſary, by adminiſtering a mild injection.</p>
               <p>Inſtead of <hi>tight lacing,</hi> which has been done by ſome, with an expectation that, by preſſing the child down, they would enſure to themſelves a more eaſy delivery, women ſhould be adviſed to wear
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:038477_0075_10121618D85BEE70"/>
jumps or ſtraps to their petticoats, going over their ſhoulders, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them from hanging too hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily upon the womb: they ſerve not only to afford a preſent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, but to prevent the womb from being preſſed down over the ſhare bones, cauſing what is called a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous belly, which always tends to induce difficulty in delivery. When the belly does become <hi>pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous,</hi> it ought to have a ſwathe ſecured around its lower part, and be ſupported by ſtraps going over the ſhoulders.</p>
               <p>Women with child ſhould live upon a light diet, but eat fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently; they do not, however, appear to be hurt by ſatisfying even their abſurd and extravagant appetites; ſtill we need not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend any bad conſequences from croſſing them. In the advanced
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:038477_0076_1012161D1C8B7308"/>
ſtages, they ought to <hi>lie down</hi> to reſt themſelves frequently in the courſe of the day.</p>
               <p>Whether the <hi>Imagination</hi> of a woman can have any effect upon the child, or not, is ſtill a queſtion. Whether it has or not, it becomes our duty to diſcourage the idea; for in not fearing its effects, we deprive it of its greateſt influence, (if it has any) and at leaſt ſave women from many an anxious thought, and many an hour of diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>In the early months, before the womb has ariſen above the brim of the baſon, its preſſure, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commonly, produces a <hi>ſuppreſſion of urine;</hi> this alſo ſometimes ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es from the urine being too long retained, whence the bladder, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing overſtretched, looſes its power

At the end of the thirty-ninth week, the womb, from ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable law of nature, exerts itſelf to get rid of its contents, not only by its own contraction, but alſo by the aſſiſting power of the whole of the ſurrounding muſcles of the belly, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>When women come near to the time when they expect to lie in, they are apt to conſider every lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle uneaſineſs in the bowels, or pains in the back, as approaching labour: hence you often will be ſent for when there is no real oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for you. There are ſome <hi>falſe pains</hi> ſo nearly reſembling the true pangs of labour, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſome judgment to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them.

Her hair ſhould be put up ſnug and tight; her clothes ſo fixed, that the part expoſed to get wet may be removed ſoon after deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very without much exertion or fatigue; and ſhe ſhould have on ſtockings, that ſhe may ſometimes walk about between her pains. Her <hi>bowels</hi> ought alſo to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to: if ſhe has not lately had any thing paſs them, ſhe ſhould have an injection imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately given to her; this will not only favour the relaxing of the parts, but prevent unpleaſant occurrences that might otherwiſe happen during the progreſs of delivery.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="unknown:038477_0082_1012163044C86550"/>
Women have been delivered in a variety of <hi>poſitions,</hi> ſuch as ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, lying on their backs, ſitting, and ſtanding on their knees: the moſt common poſition, however, is, either that between ſitting and lying on their backs, or lying on their ſide: when they are in the former poſture, the only movable bone of the whole baſon, the rump bone, is ſo much preſſed upon by the weight of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's body, as muſt certainly tend to retard delivery. The moſt eaſy ſituation, and that which is alſo moſt convenient for the operator, appears to be for her to lie on her <hi>left ſide,</hi> with her back near the edge of the bed, and her knees drawn up and ſeparated by a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. It would be adviſeable to have her delivered on a <hi>ſeparate bed</hi> from the one ſhe is to lay in, ſo that ſhe may be removed, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:038477_0083_10121636CDFBE908"/>
after, into a dry, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable ſituation: for this purpoſe, then, a little cot ought always to be procured, if poſſible.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of labour, the contraction of the womb, which accompanies every pain, preſſing generally upon its contents, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally bears hardeſt upon the leaſt reſiſting parts; hence the mouth of the womb is gradually dilated: as this dilatation is encreaſed by a repetition of pains, part of the bag, containing the fluid in which the child floats, is preſſed, in form of a bladder of water, into the opening, ſtretching it in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a wedge, acted upon by the ſuperincumbent power of the pains; preparing the way (in a natural caſe) for the bulky and more reſiſting head of the child.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="unknown:038477_0084_101216385156C050"/>
As the labour advances, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters gather more and more, and uſually, by the time the mouth of the womb is fully dilated, the membranous bag breaks by the force of the pains, and the waters are diſcharged by a ſudden guſh. This terminates what is called the <hi>firſt ſtage</hi> of labour.</p>
               <p>Frequently a remiſſion of the pains follows the diſcharge of the waters, but this is of but ſhort duration. The pains ſoon return, but often ſomewhat different from what they were at the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for now, in place of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſtreſſing pain in the lower part of the body, ſeemingly unfix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to any end, they aſſume a more encouraging and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate nature, bearing down and attended with a ſenſe of a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:038477_0085_1012163A704ED628"/>
in the womb to get rid of its contents.</p>
               <p>The membranes being broken, and the waters evacuated, the head now falls down into the cavity of the baſon, and by the continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the pains, is forced for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, taking its natural turns, till at length it paſſes through the bones, and preſſes hard upon the external ſoft parts, which, gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally dilating, permit its paſſage through them; when, uſually, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſhort reſpite, another pain expells the ſhoulders, and the body and hips ſoon follow.</p>
               <p>The courſe of a natural labour, as here deſcribed, you will not find to hold good in every caſe, but diverſified in a variety of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars: thus inſtead of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters being preſerved till the full
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:038477_0086_1012163BF22D13D8"/>
dilation of the orifice of the womb, you will often find them ſpontaneouſly diſcharged long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that period: and at other times, (though very ſeldom) you will find the membranes, with the waters, not ruptured even after the head has paſſed through the mouth of the womb. Inſtead of a temporary ſuſpenſion of pain upon the diſcharge of the waters, you ſometimes will find the child expelled by the continuation and force of the ſame pain whereby they were broken: in other caſes when the child does not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately follow the flow of the waters, yet the body will be born by the power of the ſame pain whereby the head is freed from the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal parts; and in other caſes again, where there has been ſome little reſpite after the birth of the head, it not unfrequently happens, that
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:038477_0087_10121642E6CA57F8"/>
the ſhoulders and body are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged at once.</p>
               <p>The womb having now got rid of ſo great a proportion of its contents, generally is free from pain for a little while, but in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting itſelf to its former ſize, it meets at length with a ſtill fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impediment to its reinſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; its powers again are called into action; pains return which ſoon effect an expulſion of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-birth: this ending the third ſtage, terminates the labour.</p>
               <p>Here a queſtion naturally ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, <hi>What are we to do all this while?</hi> How are we to conduct ourſelves, what attention muſt we pay our patient, and what aſſiſtance can we afford her?</p>
               <p>Having prepared the bed, &amp;c.
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:038477_0088_10121645DB87BAC0"/>
as directed, our patient's pains becoming conſiderably hard; ſhe naturally will be led to lie down while they are upon her, at which time it will be proper for us, when the pain is going off, to aſcertain, by a careful <hi>examination,</hi> the ſtate of the labour, how far the orifice of the womb is dilated, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs of the waters, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>head</hi> of the child (known by its roundneſs, hardneſs, and firm reſiſtance to the touch, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable even before the waters are preſſed forward or the womb opened) is the preſenting part: if it is, every encouragement ſhould be given, that all things appear to be doing well: but we ſhould be very cautious how we give encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of a ſpeedy delivery, leſt thereby we wear out the woman's patience before the proceſs has gotten through with: indeed our
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:038477_0089_1012164783801A58"/>
greateſt care muſt here be directed towards keeping up our patient's ſpirits and preventing her from looking out too ſoon for an end of her diſtreſſes; and we may aſſure her, as in truth it is the caſe, that generally, the <hi>longeſt labours</hi> have the <hi>ſhorteſt gettings-up,</hi> and that <hi>ſhort labours</hi> give <hi>long afterpains.</hi> Upon theſe principles, we ought not to hurry the woman into bed, but as long as ſhe finds herſelf able to be about, let her keep up.</p>
               <p>The pains continuing, after ſome little time, more or leſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they may be, it will be prudent to <hi>examine again,</hi> to find how matters are going on; but we ſhould be careful not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, at leaſt not very critically, during the continuance of a pain, for fear of rupturing the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, whereby the opening of
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:038477_0090_10121603AD157160"/>
the womb would have to be dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the preſſure of the child's head, which, from its bulk, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>upon</hi> the orifice, would not anſwer the purpoſe ſo eaſily and quickly as the bag with the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that are inſinuated <hi>into</hi> it, and enlarging during every pain. A premature breaking of the waters always portends a more tardy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſtage of the labour having conſiderably advanced, and the pains becoming more ſevere, it will be prudent for the woman to be fixed in a proper poſition for delivery, <abbr>viz.</abbr> lying on her left ſide, with her back near the edge of the bed, and her knees drawn up and ſeparated as before direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. She ſhould be properly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by ſome of her <hi>female friends,</hi> a few of whom are always
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:038477_0091_10121651F8D13250"/>
welcome companions upon ſuch occaſions, not only on account of the aſſiſtance they afford in ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling her to bear her pains to more advantage, but alſo as their cheerful converſation ſupports her ſpirits, and inſpires her with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence. There is nothing, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, for <hi>us</hi> to do, but like dutiful handmaids of nature, to wait with patience till the breaking of the waters, announcing the end of the firſt ſtage, calls upon us for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther attentions.</p>
               <p>But <hi>not always</hi> upon the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the waters, is our <hi>immediate</hi> interference neceſſary: it will, however, be adviſable for us then to attend to the progreſs of the head, and when we find it has paſſed through the bones and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes hard upon the external ſoft parts, putting the <hi>perinaeum</hi> upon
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:038477_0092_101216538168AFF0"/>
the ſtretch; then, and not till then, is our aſſiſtance required, and here the only aid that we can give is, gently to ſupport the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinaeum with the palm of the hand, or the two thumbs, left the head ſhould be puſhed forward ſo faſt as to endanger its tearing. When the pains are very ſtrong, and the head appears to be rapidly advancing, we ſhould make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably firm reſiſtance to its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, and inſtead of urging the woman to make uſe of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary exertions to forward the birth, as is too often the caſe, we ſhould rather diſſuade her from it, by warning her of the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that may follow: nor even where the buſineſs goes on more ſlowly, ſhould our attention to this part be neglected; ſince a lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of it is one of the moſt unfortunate accidents that could
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:038477_0093_101216550638BA48"/>
happen, particularly as a reunion thereof can never after be effected.</p>
               <p>A few pains, at moſt, now will clear the head from theſe parts; when after, perhaps, a little abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they are renewed and ſoon force out the ſhoulders, during which alſo, we muſt not neglect the perinaeum, which ſtill will be much upon the ſtretch and in ſome danger of being injured. After the ſhoulders are born, we are not (as ſome are too apt to do) to lay hold of the child and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract it, but with becoming pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience ſtill wait till nature ſhall deliver it into our hands: we may, and indeed it will be proper for us, to ſupport the body of the child, ſo as, when it is naturally expelled, to be ready to take it, and directly to turn its face from towards the mother, to prevent its
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:038477_0094_1012165833FC2E88"/>
being ſuffocated, by having its lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle mouth filled with the diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es that ſometimes follow immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately upon its birth.</p>
               <p>The child being wrapped in a warmed flannel, and a flannel cap put on (to protect its head from the too ſudden impreſſion of the cold air, which otherwiſe is very apt to give it the ſnuffles) it ſhould be permitted to lay, without being ſeparated from the mother, till we have a <hi>full</hi> evidence of the change in the circulation of the blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing completely made; not merely by the child's crying, but by the pulſation in the navel ſtring en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely ceaſing: then the cord may be firmly tied with a waxed thread in two places; one, about three fingers breadth from the navel, the other an inch further up: the child may then be ſeparated by
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:038477_0095_1012165ED4B329F0"/>
cutting between the ligatures; the firſt of theſe ſecures the child from the loſs of blood in caſe the circulation ſhould return in the cord; the other is to prevent its bleeding to the detriment of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond child in caſe of twins, whoſe afterbirths are ſometimes united.</p>
               <p>Some adviſe tying the cord and ſeparating the child immediately after it is born, particularly if it cries heartily; but ſurely theſe muſt have but a very limited idea of the great change that takes place in the body of their little charge, when it firſt begins to breathe, or they cannot believe but that it muſt require ſome little time for its eſtabliſhment: indeed the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual ceſſation of the circulation in the cord after a few minutes, proves nature to be as fully ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to the accompliſhment of this
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:038477_0096_1012166057CD9508"/>
as of the other part of her work; nor ought we more to preſume upon regulating her movements. It is very true that children <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> ſurvive ſuch treatment. This indeed proves the powers of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in bearing up againſt injuries, but to me affords no arguments for our inflicting them. If many lives are not loſt, it is highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that the foundation of many diſeaſes is laid by ſuch premature conduct.</p>
               <p>The child being ſeparated, we muſt apply our hand upon the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's belly, to aſcertain whether there is not <hi>another</hi> child, if there is <hi>not,</hi> the womb will be felt low down in the body, contracted in the form of a hard, round ball; but if there <hi>is,</hi> the ſwelling will not be much leſs than before the birth of the firſt child.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="unknown:038477_0097_10121661E0116960"/>
In caſe of twins, after the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the firſt, the head of the other child, generally, ſoon falls down into the baſon, and follows the ſame courſe as the firſt, and ſhould be managed in the ſame way.</p>
               <p>After the diviſion of the navel ſtring, our next attention is to be turned towards the expulſion of the <hi>afterbirth,</hi> (this is conſidered as the third ſtage of labour) and often, by this time, we will find it either diſcharged, or ſeparated and laying looſe in the vagina; if not, we may leave it entirely to nature, or at moſt to pull but very gently upon the cord in time of a pain. When it appears to lie in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage and not to come forward eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we may introduce a finger, and bring its edge down, whereby it may be extracted without any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty.
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:038477_0098_10121664E0A28DA0"/>
It ſhould be drawn away with the greateſt caution, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent part of the membranes being left behind, and alſo to bring away the clots of blood, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe might be the cauſe of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome <hi>afterpains.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nothing can be more hazardous than attempting to hurry away the afterbirth, by pulling hard upon the cord, for we thereby not only riſk breaking the cord, thence loſing a proper conductor, in caſe manual aid ſhould after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards become neceſſary to bring it away, but we may produce a partial ſeparation of the cake, with a rupture of the veſſels, inducing a dangerous flooding, or elſe, as has ſometimes happened, we may pull the womb down through the external parts, turning it inſide outwards.</p>
               <p>

The woman having got through with her labour, is to have her wet clothes removed, and to be put in to a dry bed, have a warm cloth applied to her to abſorb the diſcharges that follow, and have a napkin bound around her; but great care ſhould be taken that it be not drawn too tight; a ſlight preſſure, to ſupport the now relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed muſcles, is all that is needful.</p>

caſes, thoſe where the head preſents, and delivery is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed within twenty-four hours, without artificial aid. Inſtances now and then occur, in head pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations, where it is protracted beyond that period: this may be owing to a variety of circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, all which, and the means of relieving them, have been particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly pointed out to you, but as it would be adviſable, in all ſuch caſes, to call in the aid of a phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, I ſhall omit repeating them here. You may ſtartle at the ideal loſs of reputation that you may ſuſtain by thus calling for aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, when perhaps nothing but <hi>time</hi> is required for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of the buſineſs: but you may rely upon its being to your advantage in the end.

If you do not now requeſt aſſiſtance, and any unfavourable circumſtances occur, you are ſure to meet with blame; but even ſhould all go well without help, you may be reputed for your hardineſs, you will not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for your care.</p>
               <p>When upon your early examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, in the commencement of labour, inſtead of the head, known by the marks before-mentioned, you find ſome other part preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the birth, you ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately refer the caſe to the care of a phyſician. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, when on that ſubject, I was particular in directing the manner of conducting every <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural</hi> caſe, and you perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the machine every variety of operation; ſtill you may recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, I conſidered this as a part of
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:038477_0102_10121672C64FAD48"/>
the buſineſs, well for you <hi>to know</hi> but not politic for you to practiſe; I ſhall therefore wave any re-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of it at this time.</p>
               <p>Preternatural <hi>adheſions of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbirth, floodings, miſcarriages, and convulſions,</hi> are all to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as diſeaſes, and out of your province; therefore, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what may have been ſaid and what you may know about them, you are by no means to preſcribe for. I cannot however omit again enforcing it upon you, to aid phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians (when occaſion may require) to overcome the prejudices of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men againſt cold applications in certain caſes of flooding, the whole principle of their oppoſition to this remedy being founded merely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on its efficacy. They are fearful of its ſuddenly checking the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, when that is the very
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:038477_0103_10121675B372F1B8"/>
object aimed at. Did my limits admit, I could repeat a number of caſes, in ſupport of what the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral experience of others have proved, that they may be uſed with as much ſafety, and often-times with much more ſucceſs, than any others means. If women have a dread of water, there can be no great objection to a ſmall proportion of ſpirits or of vinegar being added; but by all means let it be <hi>cold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I cannot conclude without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating, in ſhort, a few remarks upon the <hi>management of women du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the month, ſo as to avoid many of the diſeaſes incident to that period.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the firſt place, the women, ought, if poſſible, to lye-in, in a lofty, airy apartment, remote from the noiſe of the ſtreet. She ſhould
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:038477_0104_1012167AAFD70E18"/>
(after having been put into a dry bed as before directed) be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to have a few hours quiet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, unmoleſted by the viſits of either friends or formal acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances. After a few hours, the child ſhould be applied to the breaſts, to draw off the milk if they have any in them, or to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licit its gradual ſecretion, if it has not yet come, thereby preventing the many inconveniences ariſing from the ſudden flood of a great quantity at once into the breaſts. The mother ſhould always ſet up <hi>in bed</hi> while ſuckling, and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe eats: by this means ſhe will favour the natural diſcharges from the womb, which when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſtagnate, are often the cauſe of the moſt diſtreſſing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. With the ſame intentions, ſhe ſhould alſo get out of bed, within twenty-four hours, or at
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:038477_0105_1012167DDD0181B0"/>
furtheſt two days after delivery; (if nothing in particular ſhould render it improper) at which time her bed is to be made up and ſheets changed. Her cloths ſhould be frequently changed, and every care taken to remove all the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive matters which ſeems ſo diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to accumulate about lying-in women. Her <hi>drinks</hi> ſhould be of the mildeſt, cooling kind, ſuch as gruel, toaſt-water, barley-water, tea, &amp;c. her <hi>diet</hi> chiefly of vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, as panado, ſago, tapioca, chocolate, &amp;c. with ripe fruits, but with very little if any wine or ſpices:—After ſome few days, ſhe may indulge in boiled meats, and ſo gradually reſume her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer diet. Her bowels ſhould be kept regular; ſomething ſhould paſs them every day, which, if it does not take place naturally, muſt be promoted by mild injections,
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:038477_0106_1012167F60002768"/>
as of warm water with a little ſweet-oil or hogs-lard and molaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; or if injections are objected to, ſhe may take a little caſtor-oil, manna, or rochelle ſalts. The <hi>room</hi> ſhould be kept temperate, and by no means over-warm. All heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drinks, or an accumulation of bed-cloaths, and indeed every thing that would heat her or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote a ſweating ſhould be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully avoided: upon the ſame account, the <hi>curtains</hi> ſhould be drawn up, ſo as to let her have every advantage of freſh, free air. By theſe means ſhe will go clear from many of the inconveniences common within the month. The manner in which many women are cooped on theſe occaſions, leaves no difficulty in accounting for the many diſeaſes, child-bed fevers, agues in the breaſt, &amp;c.

               <p>When women, by a kind of falſe tenderneſs, are carefully pent up within cloſe-drawn curtains, and kept in a conſtant perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who can be ſurpriſed, that they ſhould often be taking cold? for even turning in bed then muſt be dangerous; the neceſſary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſures from ſitting up, in attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the calls of nature, or for ſuckling their child, muſt always be a great riſk; the getting out of bed, the height of imprudence; and the leaſt breath of cold air will almoſt certainly diſorder them.</p>
               <p>When the woman's <hi>after-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges</hi> are moderate, or even very <hi>ſcanty,</hi> no diſorder attending, no means ſhould be uſed to increaſe them, excepting the getting up
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:038477_0108_10121686DD43F568"/>
often, and continuing longer and longer out of bed each time; this will favour their evacuation when accumulated in the womb; their ſtagnation there, and not their ſuppreſſion, being the ſource of danger. When they are copious, the woman continuing well, they need no remedy; but when they are in <hi>exceſs</hi> and appear to induce weakneſs, and do not moderate by keeping in a horizontal poſition; apply immediately for medical aid.</p>
               <p>The milk ought not to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſtagnate in the breaſts, but ſhould be drawn off as often as four or five times a day. In caſe the breaſts ſhould become hard or knotted, they may be rubbed with warm olive oil or gooſe greaſe, and afterwards covered with a plaiſter compoſed of oil and bees<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wax;
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:038477_0109_10121689DED2ABB8"/>
or, thoſe failing, they may have a cool poultice, made with bread and lead-water, or cloths wetted with lead-water, conſtantly applied to the part till the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint is removed.</p>
               <p>The nipples are ſometimes ſo preſſed in, as not to be taken hold of by the child. They may be drawn out by cupping-glaſſes, or, what generally anſwers the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe equally well is, to take a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon black bottle, with a ſmooth mouth, fill it with warm water, then empty it, and immediately apply the mouth of the bottle over the nipple; as it cools, the nipple will gradually be drawn out, ſo as to be laid hold of without any more difficulty. Women's nipples being drawn out by ſucking, at the ſame time loſing, in a degree, the matters wherewith they are
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:038477_0110_1012168CD79AF418"/>
naturally covered and protected, and being afterwards, again preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed down by the women's cloaths, are very apt to crack open in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent places: this is often avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and frequently cured by care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully wiping them dry, after the child has done ſucking, and wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a wax ring, or leaden cap<note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe rings are made by having a piece of bees-wax as large as half a dollar and near half an inch thick, perfectly ſmooth, through which is to be made a hole ſufficiently large to take in the nipple. The leaden caps might, perhaps, with more propriety, be called hats, as they exactly reſemble them in ſhape, the rim being half an inch wide and the bowl large enough to receive the nipple, perforated with ſeveral little holes, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit what milk may be diſcharged to run freely out.</note> upon them, ſo as to permit them to retain their ſhape; having them at the ſame time, either covered with a ſolution of the cooling emollient ſeeds, particularly of quinces, or anointed with a little
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:038477_0111_1012169070800018"/>
beef's marrow, or an ointment made by melting equal parts of white wax and ſpermaceti with as much ſweet oil as to make it of a proper conſiſtence.</p>
               <p>Having thus followed the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man through the month, let us return to the child. We left it wrapped up in warm flannel till the woman could be firſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated: now our little prize muſt be attended to; it muſt be waſhed with warm water and ſoap, have its navel ſtring wrapped up in a piece of dry linen rag and laid upon its belly, where it muſt be ſecured by a flannel belly-band, bound <hi>only moderately</hi> tight around the body of the child. The child muſt, in other reſpects, be warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and comfortably dreſſed.</p>
               <p>In regard to the <hi>dreſs</hi> of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:038477_0112_101216935D503620"/>
this one principle ſhould always be had in view, that the looſer and eaſier it is, the better; and that every binding that tends to cramp their motions or oppreſs their bodies, equally tends to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure their health. There cannot, however, be any great objection to ſecuring their little hands from rubbing their eyes; and trick that many of them are very much giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to. In fixing on their cloaths, as few pins ſhould be employed as poſſible; and indeed in no caſe ſhould they be uſed where ſtrings can as well be ſubſtituted in their place.</p>
               <p>The firſt waſhing, it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, ſhould be with <hi>warm</hi> wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. In the after-waſhings, which ſhould be at leaſt once every day, the heat of the water ſhould be gradually diminiſhed, ſo as by the
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:038477_0113_1012169604749C18"/>
third week at furtheſt to make it evidently <hi>cooler</hi> than the child's body; and, after a little while, if we would ſecure it againſt the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitudes of weather in our varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble climate, we ſhould have it dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in <hi>cold water</hi> every morning. By this treatment, two great points in preſerving the health of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are obtained at once, <abbr>viz.</abbr> cleanlineſs and hardineſs. Man may truly be ſaid to be the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of habit; by uſe he may be brought to take even poiſons with impunity; ſo, by a careful grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may infants be rendered, in a great degree, proof againſt the uſual hurtful effects of cold.</p>
               <p>This ineſtimable preſervative, however, requires ſome caution in its application, to obtain its beſt
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:038477_0114_1012169C7373CC78"/>
effects. Children ſhould be mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dipped in the water, but not continued in it for any length of time, (and if they are very weak, the water ſhould have a proportion of common ſalt, as three or four ounces to a gallon, diſſolved in it) and upon their coming out, they ſhould be wrapped in a flannel, and have their bodies well rubbed before they are dreſſed.</p>
               <p>Beſides the general bath, the folds in the ſkin, as of the neck, the arm-pits, the groins, behind the ears, &amp;c. ſhould be waſhed out ſeveral times in the courſe of the day, with cold water, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their chafing, particularly in fat children. If, notwithſtanding, theſe parts ſhould chafe, inſtead of ſimple water, they may be waſhed
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:038477_0115_1012169DF60A0BA0"/>
frequently with cold hyſon tea, or a weak ſolution of ſugar of lead, or of white vitriol, (in the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of fifteen or twenty grains to half a pint of rain water) and have them duſted with a little dry flour or calamine powder.</p>
               <p>Another main article in preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the health of children, is, the early habituating them to exerciſe and free air. If grown perſons can hardly ſupport themſelves without exerciſe and freſh air, how can it be ſuppoſed that tender infants (whoſe growth is to be expanded, and circulation extended, by the ſole power of their own ſtrength) can poſſibly proſper without them? Their conſtant uneaſineſs when kept ſtill, and the agreeable ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction they expreſs upon being
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:038477_0116_1012169F7924FB88"/>
dandled about, fully prove the utility of that meaſure; while the great and partial mortality among them in crowded places, clearly ſhews their neceſſity of the pureſt atmoſphere.</p>
               <p>In reſpect to the diet of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, there is nothing equal to their mother's milk, and where any ſubſtitute or addition thereto is wanted, that which approaches the neareſt to it, is the beſt: none, perhaps, is better than cows milk, diluted with water and ſweetened, or a little ſalted when it appears to curdle much upon the ſtomach. Bread and every other more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial food in any form, requires a degree of digeſtion which the ſtomachs of infants, in their early days, are no ways calculated to
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:038477_0117_101216A2491FCCD8"/>
perform; hence, when they are ſtowed with pap or panado, &amp;c. they are ſo often afflicted with a train of complaints in their little bowels.</p>
               <p>It is a common thing with nurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, almoſt immediately upon the birth of the child, to give it ſome purgative to carry off the black matter contained in its bowels, and if its mother's firſt milk does not anſwer that purpoſe, or if ſhe has not yet got any, or the child ſucks an older milk of a nurſe, this certainly is a very proper ſtep. With this intention, a little manna and water, molaſſes or ſyrup of roſes, may be repeatedly given till it has its effect, or the babe may take a teaſpoonful of a weak infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of rheubarb in water every
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:038477_0118_101216A8118FF8C0"/>
hour till it purges. Coſtiveneſs, that may occur afterwards, will be beſt relieved by ſuppoſitories or mild glyſters.</p>
               <p>The treatment of the <hi>diſeaſes</hi> of infants being the proper buſineſs of phyſicians, I ſhall paſs by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticing here. But, as in caſes of apparently <hi>ſtill-born</hi> children, the neceſſary means of their recovery would often come in too late, were you to wait till a phyſician could be procured, I cannot omit again calling your attention to them.</p>
               <p>It not unfrequently happens, that children do not, for ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time after they are born, ſhew any ſigns of life by crying or even breathing. Upon ſuch occaſions,
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:038477_0119_101216AB29193998"/>
I have often ſet their reſpiratory organs in motion, by blowing a ſudden blaſt of air into their mouths. Should this not ſucceed, the child ſhould be immerſed in a bowl of warm water, and have its body rubbed over with the hand, while the circulation in the cord ſhould be ſupported or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted (if it ſhould have ſtopped) by wrapping it in a warm flannel. Theſe means being continued for a few minutes, without any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of life, and the pulſation in the navel ſtring appearing to be entirely and irrecoverably ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, it may be tied and cut. The child ſtill continuing in the warm bath, is, by your blowing through a quill fixed into one of its noſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trils, while the other and its mouth are kept perfectly cloſed, to have
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:038477_0120_101216AE8B89FAC0"/>
its little lungs dilated; then by preſſing on its belly and breaſt, the air muſt be driven out again, when, in like manner, they may be filled and diſcharged repeated<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, imitating natural breathing as near as you can; this ſhould be continued for a long time, unleſs the child ſhould ſooner ſhow ſome ſigns of life, by gaping &amp;c. after which ſigns, if it ſhould not ſtill breathe <hi>freely,</hi> it may be excited by a little ſpirits or ſnuff applied to its noſtrils, or by ſlapping it on its buttocks.</p>
               <p>It ſometimes happens with ſtill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born children, that their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances are of a dark livid colour, from a ſtagnation of blood; in theſe caſes it is neceſſary to divide the navel ſtring immediately, and
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:038477_0121_101216B112ED1BA8"/>
let it bleed a little before tying it; if this does not revive it, its lungs muſt then be inflated as above di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected; by a perſeverance in which, many children have been recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to the no leſs aſtoniſhment of deſpairing friends than enjoyment of their diſconſolate mothers.</p>
               <p>Before we part, let me caution you againſt that ſcandalous diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to defamation, ſo prevalent among perſons of the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. Whatever may be your opinion of thoſe, who have not had like advantages with your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſtill they are entitled to your compaſſion and tenderneſs; your mild carriage will enſure their affections, your inſtructive converſations may improve their practice, and excite in them a
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:038477_0122_101216B29475E270"/>
laudable ſpirit of further enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. In regard to yourſelves, would you be reſpected by others, ſhew a deſerving claim thereto, by your reſpect one towards another; if <hi>you</hi> ſpeak <hi>lightly</hi> one of another, wherefore can ye expect the <hi>world</hi> to ſpeak <hi>well</hi> of you.</p>
               <p>Permit me to recommend to your particular attention, the calls of the poor, <q>
                     <hi>He that hideth his face</hi> (from them) <hi>ſhall have many a curſe.</hi>
