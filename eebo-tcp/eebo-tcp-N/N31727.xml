            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

As I acknowledged this, I felt a ſuffuſion of a finer kind up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my cheek—more warm and friendly to man, than what Burgundy (at leaſt of two livres a bottle, which was ſuch as I had been drinking) could have produced.</p>

                     <head>THE MONK. CALAIS.</head>
                     <p>I HAD ſcarce uttered the words, when a poor monk of the order of St. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis came into the room to beg ſomething for his convent. No man cares to have his virtues the ſport of contingencies— or one man may be generous, as another man is puiſſant—<hi>ſed non, quo ad hanc</hi>—or be it as it may—for there is no regular reaſoning upon the ebbs and flows of our humours; they may depend upon the ſame cauſes, for ought I know, which influence the tides themſelves—'twould oft be no diſcredit to us, to ſuppoſe it was ſo: I am ſure at leaſt for myſelf, that in many a caſe I ſhould be more highly ſatisfied, to have it ſaid by the world, "I had had an affair with the moon, in which there was neither ſin nor ſhame," than have it paſs altogether as my own
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:041886_0007_101B63081299BFD0"/>
act and deed, wherein there was ſo much of both.</p>
                     <p>—But be this as it may. The moment I caſt my eyes upon him, I was predeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined not to give him a ſingle ſons; and accordingly I put my purſe into my pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et— buttoned it up—ſet myſelf a little more upon my centre, and advanced up gravely to him: there was ſomething, I fear, forbidding in my look: I have his figure this moment before my eyes, and think there was that in it which deſerved better.</p>
                     <p>The monk, as I judged from the break in his tonſure, a few ſcattered white hairs upon his temples, being all that remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of it, might be about ſeventy—but from his eyes, and that ſort of fire, which was in them, which ſeemed more temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate by courteſy than years, could be no more than ſixty.—Truth might lie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween—He was certainly ſixty-five; and the general air of his countenance, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſomething ſeemed to have been planting wrinkles in it before their time, agreed to the account.</p>
                     <p>It was one of thoſe heads, which Guido has often painted—mild, pale—penetrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, free from all common-place ideas of fat contented ignorance looking down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards upon the earth—it looked forwards; but looked, as if it looked at ſomething be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond this world. How one of his order
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:041886_0008_101B5A08B7C91CD8"/>
came by it, heaven above, who let it fall upon a monk's ſhoulders, beſt knows: but it would have ſuited a Bramin, and had I met it upon the plains of Indoſtan, I had reverenced it.</p>
                     <p>The reſt of his outline may be given in a few ſtrokes; one might put it into the hands of any one to deſign, for 'twas nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther elegant or otherwiſe, but as charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and expreſſion made it ſo: it was a thin, ſpare form, ſomething above the common ſize, if it loſt not the diſtinction, by a bend forwards in the figure—but it was the attitude of intreaty; and as it now ſtands preſented to my imagination, it gained more than it loſt by it.</p>
                     <p>When he had entered the room three paces, he ſtood ſtill; and laying his left hand upon his breaſt, (a ſlender white ſtaff with which he journeyed being in his right)—when I had got cloſe up to him, he introduced himſelf with the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſtory of the wants of his convent, and the poverty of his order—and did it with ſo ſimple a grace,—and ſuch an air of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precation was there in the whole caſt of his look and figure—I was bewitched not to have been ſtruck with it—</p>
                     <p>— A better reaſon was, I had predeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined not to give him a ſingle ſous.</p>

for the ranſom of the unfortunate—The monk made me a bow—but of all others, reſumed I, the unfortunate of our own country, ſurely, have the firſt rights; and I have left thouſands in diſtreſs upon our own ſhore—The monk gave a cordial wave with his head—as much as to ſay, No doubt, there is miſery enough in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry corner of the world, as well as within our convent—But we diſtinguiſh, ſaid I, laying my hand upon the ſleeve of his tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick, in return for his appeal—we diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, my good father! betwixt thoſe who wiſh only to eat the bread of their own labour—and thoſe who eat the bread of other people's, and have no other plan in life, but to get through it in ſloth and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, <hi>for the love of God.</hi>

                     <p>The poor Franciſcan made no reply: a hectic of a moment paſſed acroſs his cheek, but could not tarry—Nature ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have had done with her reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in him; he ſhewed none—but letting his ſtaff fall within his arm, he preſſed both his hands with reſignation upon his breaſt, and retired.</p>

                     <p>WHEN a man is diſcontented with himſelf, it has one advantage how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that it puts him into an excellent frame of mind for making a bargain. Now there being no travelling through France and Italy without a chaiſe—and nature generally prompting us to the thing we are fitteſt for, I walk'd out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the coach yard to buy or hire ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that kind to my purpoſe: an old <note n="*" place="bottom">A chaiſe, ſo called in France, from its holding but one perſon.</note> Deſobligeant in the furtheſt corner of the court, hit my fancy at firſt ſight, ſo I inſtantly got into it, and finding it in tolerable harmony with my feelings, I ordered the waiter to call Monſieur Deſſein the maſter of the hotel—but Monſieur Deſſein being gone to veſpers, and not caring to face the Franciſcan whom I ſaw on the oppoſite ſide of the court, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with a lady juſt arrived, at the inn—I drew the taffeta curtain betwixt us, and being determined to write my journey, I took out my pen and ink, and wrote the preface to it in the <hi>Diſobligeant.</hi>

                     <head>PREFACE. IN THE DESOBLIGEANT.</head>
                     <p>IT muſt have been obſerved by many a peripatetic philoſopher, that nature has ſet up by her own unqueſtionable authority certain boundaries and fences to circumſcribe the diſcontent of man: ſhe has effected her purpoſe in the quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and eaſieſt manner by laying him under almoſt inſuperable obligations to work out his eaſe, and to ſuſtain his ſufferings at home. It is there only that ſhe has provided him with the moſt ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able objects to partake of his happineſs, and bear a part of that burden which in all countries and ages, has ever been too heavy for one pair of ſhoulders. 'Tis true we are endued with an imperfect power of ſpreading our happineſs ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times beyond <hi>her</hi> limits, but 'tis ſo order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that from the want of languages, connections, and dependencies, and from the difference in education, cuſtoms and habits, we lie under ſo many impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in communicating our ſenſations out of our own ſphere, as often amount to a total impoſſibility.</p>
                     <p>It will always follow from hence, that the balance of ſentimental commerce is
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:041886_0014_101B5A135914B720"/>
always againſt the expatriated adventur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: he muſt buy what he has little occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for at their own price—his converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will ſeldom be taken in exchange for theirs without a large diſcount—and this, by the by, eternally driving him into the hands of more equitable brokers for ſuch converſation as he can find, it requires no great ſpirit of divination to gueſs at his party—</p>
                     <p>This brings me to my point; and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally leads me (if the ſee-ſaw of this <hi>Diſobligeant</hi> will but let me get on) into the efficient as well as the final cauſes of travelling—</p>
                     <p>Your idle people that leave their native country and go abroad for ſome reaſon or reaſons which may be derived from one of theſe general cauſes.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The third claſs includes the whole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of peregrine martyrs; more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thoſe travellers who ſet out upon their travels with the benefit of the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, either as delinquents travelling un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the direction of governors recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the magiſtrate—or young

                     <p>There is a fourth claſs, but their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is ſo ſmall that they would not deſerve a diſtinction, was it not neceſſary in a work of this nature to obſerve the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt preciſion and nicety, to avoid a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of character. And theſe men I ſpeak of, are ſuch as croſs the ſeas and ſojourn in a land of ſtrangers with a view of ſaving money for various rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and upon various pretences: but as they might alſo ſave themſeves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers a great deal of unneceſſary trouble by ſaving their money at home—and as their reaſons for travelling are the leaſt complex of any other ſpecies of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grants, I ſhall diſtinguiſh theſe gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men by the name of

                     <p>I am well aware, at the ſame time, as both my travels and obſervations will be altogether of a different caſt from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of my fore-runners; that I might have inſiſted upon a whole nitch entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to myſelf—but I ſhould break in upon the confines of the <hi>vain</hi> traveller, in wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to draw attention towards me, till I have ſome better grounds for it, than the mere <hi>novelty of my vehicle.</hi>

                     <p>It is ſufficient for my reader, if he has been a traveller himſelf, that with ſtudy and reflection hereupon he may be able to determine his own place and rank in the catalogue—it will be one ſtep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards knowing himſelf; as it is great odds, but he retains ſome tincture and reſemblance, of what he imbibed or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out, to the preſent hour.</p>
                     <p>The man who firſt tranſplanted the grape of Burgundy to the Cape of Good

Hope (obſerve he was a Dutch man) ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dreamt of drinking the ſame wine at the Cape, that the ſame grape produced upon the French mountains—he was too phlegmatic for that—but undoubtedly he expected to drink ſome ſort of vinous liquor; but whether good, bad, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different—he knew enough of this world to know, that it did not depend upon his choice, but that what is generally called <hi>Chance</hi> was to decide his ſucceſs: however, he hoped for the beſt, and in theſe hopes, by an intemperate confidence in the fortitude of his head, and the depth of his diſcretion, <hi>Mynheer</hi> might poſſibly overſet both in his new vineyard; and by diſcovering his nakedneſs, become a laughing ſtock to his people.</p>
                     <p>Even ſo it <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>Knowledge and improvements are to be got by ſailing and poſſing for that purpoſe; but whether uſeful knowledge and real improvements, is all a lottery— and even where the adventurer is ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, the acquired ſtock muſt be uſed with caution and ſobriety to turn to any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit—but as the chances run prodigiouſly the other way both as to the acquiſition and application, I am of opinion, that a man would act as wiſely, if he could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail

upon himſelf, to live contented with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out foreign knowledge or foreign im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements, eſpecially if he lives in a country that has no abſolute want of either—and indeed, much grief of heart has it oft and many a time coſt me, when I have obſerved how many a ſoul ſtep the inquiſitive Traveller has meaſured to ſee ſights and look into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries; all which, as Sanco Panca ſaid to Don Quixote, they might have ſeen dry-ſhod at home. It is an age ſo full of light, that there is ſcarce a country or corner of Europe whoſe beams are not croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and interchanged with others—Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in moſt of its branches, and in moſt affairs, is like muſic in an Italian ſtreet, whereof thoſe may partake, who pay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing—But there is no nation under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven—and God is my record, (before whoſe tribunal I muſt one day come and give an account of this work)—that I do not ſpeak it vauntingly—But there is no nation under heaven abounding with more variety of learning—where the ſciences may be more fitly woo'd, or more ſurely won than here—where art is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, and will ſo ſoon riſe high— where nature (take her all together) has ſo little to anſwer for—and, to cloſe all, where there is more wit and variety of character to feed the mind with—Where then, my dear countrymen, are you go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.—</p>

I had wrote myſelf pretty well out of conceit with the <hi>Deſobligeant</hi>; and Monſ. Deſſein ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, with a ſhrug, as if it would no way ſuit me, it immediately ſtruck my
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:041886_0020_101B62D33B2622B8"/>
fancy that it belong'd to ſome <hi>innocent traveller,</hi> who, on his return home, had left it to Monſ. Deſſein's honour to make the moſt of. Four months had elapſed ſince it had finiſh'd its career of Europe in the corner of Monſ. Deſſein's coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard; and having ſallied out from thence but a vampt-up buſineſs at the firſt, though it had been twice taken to pieces on Mount Sinnis, it had not profited much by its adventures—but by none ſo little as the ſtanding ſo many months un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitied in the corner of Monſ. Deſſein's coach-yard.—Much indeed was not to be ſaid for it—but ſomething might— and when a few words will reſcue miſery out of her diſtreſs, I hate the man who can be a churl of them.</p>
                     <p>—Now was I the maſter of this hotel, ſaid I laying the point of my fore-finger on Monſ <hi>Deſſein</hi>'s breaſt, I would inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly make a point of getting rid of this unfortunate <hi>Deſobligeant</hi>—it ſtands ſwing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reproaches at you every time you paſs by it—</p>

                     <p>I have always obſerved, when there is as much <hi>ſour</hi> as <hi>ſweet</hi> in a compliment, that an Engliſhman is eternally at a loſs within himſelf, whether to take it, or let it alone: a Frenchman never is: Monſ. Deſſein made me a bow.</p>

                        <hi>C'eſt bien vrai,</hi> ſaid he—But in this caſe I ſhould only exchange one diſquietude for another, and with loſs: figure to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, my dear Sir, that in giving you a chaiſe which would fall to pieces before you had got half way to Paris—figure to yourſelf how much I ſhould ſuffer, in giving an ill impreſſion of myſelf to a man of honour, and lying at the mercy, as I muſt do, <hi>d'un homme d'eſprit.</hi>

                     <p>The doſe was made up exactly after my own preſcription; ſo I could not help taking it—and returning Monſ. Deſſein his bow, without more caſuiſtry we walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together towards his Remiſe, to take a view of his magazine of chaiſes.</p>

                     <p>IT muſt needs be a hoſtile kind of a world, when the buyer (if it be but of a ſorry poſt-chaiſe) cannot go forth with the ſeller thereof into the ſtreet to termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the difference betwixt them, but he inſtantly falls into the ſame frame of mind and views his conventioniſt with the ſame ſort of eye, as if he was going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him to Hyde-park corner to fight a duel. For my own part, being but a poor ſword's-man, and no way a match for Monſieur <hi>Deſſein,</hi> I felt the ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of all the movements within me, to which the ſituation is incident— I look'd at Monſieur <hi>Deſſein</hi> through and through—eyed him as he walked along in profile—then, <hi>en face</hi>—thought he looked like a Jew—then a Turk—diſliked his wig—curſed him by my gods—wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him at the devil.</p>
                     <p>—And is all this to be lighted up in the heart for a beggarly account of three or four louis d'ors, which is the moſt I can be over-reached in?—Baſe paſſion! ſaid I, turning myſelf about, as a man na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally does upon a ſudden reverſe of

ſentiment—baſe, ungentle paſſion! thy hand is againſt every man, and every man's hand againſt thee—heaven forbid! ſaid ſhe, raiſing her hand up to her fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, for I had turned full in front upon the lady whom I had ſeen in conference with the monk—ſhe had followed us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceived—Heaven forbid indeed! ſaid I, offering her my own—ſhe had a black pair of ſilk gloves open only at the thumb and two fore-fingers, ſo accepted it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſerve—and I led her up to the door of the remiſe.</p>
                     <p>Monſieur <hi>Deſſein</hi> had <hi>diabled</hi> the key above fifty times before he found out he had come with a wrong one in his hand: we were as impatient as himſelf to have it opened; and ſo attentive to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle, that I continued holding her hand almoſt without knowing it; ſo that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Deſſein</hi> left us together with her hand in mine, and with our faces turned towards the door of the Remiſe, and ſaid he would be back in five minutes.</p>
                     <p>Now a colloquy of five minutes, in ſuch a ſituation, is worth one of as many ages, with your faces turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſtreet: in the latter caſe, 'tis drawn from the objects and occurrences without—when your eyes are fixed upon a dead blank—you draw purely from yourſelves. A ſilence of a ſingle moment upon Monſieur <hi>Deſſein</hi>'s leaving us, had

been fatal to the ſituation—ſhe had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly turned about—ſo I begun the converſation inſtantly.—</p>
                     <p>—But what were the temptations, (as I write not to apologize for the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of my heart in this tour,—but to give an account of them) —ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed with the ſame ſimplicity, with which I felt them.</p>

not critically handſome, but there was that in it, which in the frame of mind I was in which attached me much more to it—it was intereſting; I fancied it wore the caracters of a widow'd look, and in that ſtate of its declenſion, which had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the two firſt paroxyſms of ſorrow, and was quietly beginning to reconcile itſelf to its loſs—but a thouſand other diſtreſſes might have traced the ſame lines; I wiſhed to know what they had been—and was ready to enquire, (had the ſame <hi>bon ton</hi> of converſation permitted, as in days of Eſdras) "<hi>What aileth thee? and why art thou diſquieted? and why is thy underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing troubled?</hi>"—In a word, I felt benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence for her; and reſolved ſome way or other to throw in my mite of courteſy— if not of ſervice.</p>
                     <p>Such were my temptations—and in this diſpoſition to give way to them, was I left alone with the lady with her hand in mine, and with our faces both turned cloſer to the door of the Remiſe than what was abſolutely neceſſary.</p>

                     <head>THE REMISE DOOR. CALAIS.</head>
                     <p>THIS certainly, fair lady! ſaid I raiſing her hand up a little light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as I began, muſt be one of fortune's whimſical doings: to take two utter ſtrangers by their hands—of different ſexes, and perhaps from different cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the globe, and in one moment place them together in ſuch a cordial ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, as friendſhip herſelf could ſcarce have atchieved for them, had ſhe project<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it for a month.</p>
                     <p>—And your reflection upon it, ſhews how much, Monſieur, ſhe has embaraſſed you by the adventure.—</p>
                     <p>When the ſituation is, what we would wiſh, nothing is ſo il-timed as to hint at the circumſtances which make it ſo: you thank fortune, continued ſhe—you had reaſon—the heart knew it, and was ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; and who but an Engliſh philoſopher would have ſent notices of it to the brain to reverſe the judgment?</p>
                     <p>In ſaying this, ſhe diſengaged her hand with a look which I thought a ſufficient commentary upon the text.</p>
                     <p>It is a miſerable picture which I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to give of the weakneſs of my heart, by owning, that it ſuffered a pain, which
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:041886_0028_101B62DED9A01EA0"/>
worthier occaſions could not have inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.—I was mortified with the loſs of her hand, and the manner in which I had loſt it carried neither oil nor wine to the wound: I never felt the pain of a ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh inferiority ſo miſerably in my life.</p>
                     <p>The triumphs of a true feminine heart are ſhort upon theſe diſcomfitures. In a very few ſeconds ſhe laid her hand upon the the cuff of my coat, in order to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh her reply; ſo ſome way or other, God knows how, I regained my ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>
                     <p>—She had nothing to add.</p>
                     <p>I forthwith began to model a different converſation for the lady. Thinking from the ſpirit as well as the moral of this, that I had been miſtaken in her character; but upon turning her face to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, the ſpirit which had animat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the reply was fled—the muſcles relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and I beheld the ſame unprotected look of diſtreſs which firſt won me to her intereſt—melancholy! to ſee ſuch ſpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs the prey of ſorrow.—I pitied her from my ſoul; and though it may ſeem ridiculous enough to a torpid heart,—I could have taken her into my arms, and cheriſhed her, though it was in the open ſtreet, without bluſhing.</p>
                     <p>The pulſations of the arteries along my fingers preſſing acroſs hers, told her what was paſſing within me: ſhe looked
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:041886_0029_101B6326B658B458"/>
down—a ſilence of ſome moments fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</p>
                     <p>I fear, in this interval, I muſt have made ſome ſlight efforts towards a cloſer compreſſion of her hand, from a ſubtile ſenſation I felt in the palm of my own— not as if ſhe was going to withdraw hers —but, as if ſhe thought about it—and I had inſallibly loſt it a ſecond time, had not inſtinct more than reaſon directed me to the laſt reſource in theſe dangers —to hold it looſely, and, in a manner as if I was every moment going to releaſe it, of myſelf; ſo ſhe let it continue, till Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Deſſein</hi> returned with the key; and in the mean time I ſet myſelf to conſider how I ſhould undo the ill impreſſions which the poor monk's ſtory, in caſe he had told it her, muſt have planted in her breaſt againſt me.</p>

                     <head>THE SNUFF BOX. CALAIS.</head>
                     <p>THE good old monk was within ſix paces of us, as the idea of him croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed my mind; and was advancing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us a little out of the line, as if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain whether he ſhould break upon us,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:041886_0030_101B62E2D0168BA8"/>
or no.—He ſtept, however, as ſoon as he came up to us, with a world of frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and having a horn ſnuff box in his hand, he preſented it open to me—You ſhall taſte mine—ſaid I, pulling out my box (which was a ſmall tortoiſe one) and putting it into his hand—'Tis moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, ſaid the monk; Then do me the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, I replied, to accept of the box and all, and when you take a pinch out of it, ſometimes recollect it was the peace-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a man who once uſed you unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ndly, but not from his heart.</p>
                     <p>The poor monk bluſhed as red as ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let. <hi>Mon Lieu!</hi> ſaid he, preſſing his hands together—you never uſed me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly.—I ſhould think, ſaid the lady, he is not likely. I bluſhed in my turn; but from what movements, I leave to the few who feel to analyſe—Excuſe me, Madam, replied I—I treated him moſt unkindly; and from no provocations—'Tis impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſaid the lady.—My god! cried the monk with a warmth of aſſeveration which ſeemed not to belong to him—the fault was in me, and in the indiſcretion of my zeal—the lady oppoſed it, and I joined with her in maintaining it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that a ſpirit ſo regulated as his, could give offence to any.</p>
                     <p>I knew not that contention could be rendered ſo ſweet and pleaſurable a thing to the nerves as I then felt it.—We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained

ſilent, without any ſenſation of that fooliſh pain which takes place, when in ſuch a circle you look for ten minutes in one another's faces without ſaying a word. Whilſt this laſted, the monk rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b'd his horn box upon the ſleeve of his tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick; and as ſoon as it had acquired a little air of brightneſs by the friction— he made a low bow, and ſaid, 'twas too late to ſay whether it was the weakneſs or goodneſs of our tempers which had involved us in this conteſt—but be it as it would—he begg'd we might exchange boxes—In ſaying this, he preſented his to me with one hand, as he took mine from me in the other; and having kiſs'd it—with a ſtream of good nature in his eyes he put it into his boſom—and took his leave.</p>
                     <p>I guard this box, as I would the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental parts of my religion, to help my mind on to ſomething better; in truth I ſeldom go abroad without it; and oft and many a time have I called up by it the courteous ſpirit of its owner to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late my own, in the juſtlings of the world; they had found full employment for his, as I learnt from his ſtory, till about the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-fifth year of his age, when upon ſome military ſervices ill requited, and meeting at the ſame time with a diſappointment in the tendereſt of paſſions, he abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſword and the ſex together, and
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:041886_0032_101B62E46D9B56B8"/>
took ſanctuary, not ſo much in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent as in himſelf.</p>
                     <p>I feel a damp upon my ſpirits, as I am going to add, that in my laſt return thro' Calais, upon enquiring after Father Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo, I heard he had been dead near three months, and was buried, not in his convent, but, according to his deſire, in a little cimetiery belonging to it, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two leagues off: I had a ſtrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſee where they had laid him— when, upon pulling out his little horn box, as I ſat by his grave, and plucking up a nettle or two at the head of it, which had no buſineſs to grow there, they all ſtruct together ſo forcibly upon my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, that I burſt into a flood of tears —but I am as weak as a woman; and I beg the world not to ſmile, but pity me.</p>

                     <p>I HAD never quitted the Lady's hand all this time; and had held it ſo long, that it would have been indecent to have let it go, without firſt preſſing it to my lips: the blood and ſpirits, which had

                     <p>Now the two travellers who had ſpoke to me in the coach-yard, happening at that criſis to be paſſing by, and obſerving our communication, naturally took it into their heads that we muſt be <hi>man</hi> and <hi>wife</hi> at leaſt; ſo ſtopping as ſoon as they came up to the door of the Remiſe, the one of them, who was the inquiſitive traveller, aſked us, if we ſet out for Paris the next morning?

                     <p>Every dirty paſſion, and bad propenſity in my nature, took the alarm, as I ſtated the propoſition—It will oblidge you to have a third horſe, ſaid AVARISE, which will put twenty livres out of your pocket.

                     <p>—You need not tell me what the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal was ſaid ſhe, laying her hand upon both mine, as ſhe interrupted, me.—A man my good Sir, has ſeldom an offer of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to make to a woman, but ſhe has a preſentiment of it ſome moments before—</p>
                     <p>Nature arms her with it, ſaid I, for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate preſervation—But I think, ſaid ſhe, looking in my face, I had no evil to apprehend—and to deal frankly with you, had determined to accept it.—If I had— (ſhe ſtopped a moment)—I believe your good will would have drawn a ſtory from me, which would have made pity the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dangerous thing in the journey.</p>
                     <p>In ſaying this, ſhe ſuffered me to kiſs her hand twice, and with a look of ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility mixed with a concern ſhe got out of the chaiſe—and bid adieu.</p>

the genuine look and air of the fellow determined the matter at once in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; ſo I hired him firſt—and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to inquire what he could do: but I ſhall find out his talents, quoth I, as I want them—beſides, a Frenchman can do every thing.</p>

With all this, La Fleur had a ſmall caſt of the coxcomb—but he ſeemed at firſt ſight to be more a cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb of nature than of art; and before I had been three days in Paris with him —he ſeemed to be no coxcomb at all.</p>

ſudden ſtop to La Fleur's career—his bidet would not paſs by it— a contention aroſe betwixt them, and the poor fellow was kick'd out of his jack-boots the very firſt kick.</p>
                     <p>La Fleur bore his fall like a French chriſtian, ſaving neither more or leſs upon it, than, Diable! ſo preſently got up and came to the charge again aſtride his bidet, beating him up to it as he would have beat his drum.</p>
                     <p>The bidet flew from one ſide of the road to the other, then back again—then this way—then that way, and in ſhort every way but by the dead aſs.—La Fleur inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the thing—and the bidet threw him.</p>

                     <p>It is not <hi>mal a propos</hi> to take notice here, that tho' La Fleur availed himſelf but of two different terms of exclamation in this encounter—namely, <hi>Diable</hi>! and <hi>Peſte</hi>! that there are nevertheleſs three, in the French language; like the poſitive, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative, and ſuperlative, one or the other

La Fleur's <hi>preve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy</hi> (for there was a paſſport in his very looks) ſoon ſet every ſervant in the kitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en at eaſe with him; and as a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whatever be his talents, has no ſort of prudery in ſhewing them, La Fleur, in leſs than five minutes, had pull'd out his fife, and leading off the dance himſelf with the firſt note, ſet the <hi>fille de chambre,</hi>

                     <p>Madame de L***, in paſſing from her brother's apartment to her own, hearing ſo much jollity below ſtairs, rung up her <hi>fille de chambre</hi> to aſk about it; and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was the Engliſh gentleman's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant who had ſet the whole houſe merry with his pipe, ſhe ordered him up.</p>
                     <p>As the poor fellow could not preſent himſelf empty, he had loaden'd himſelf in going up ſtairs with a thouſand com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments to Madame de L***, on the part of his maſter—added a long apocrypha of inquires after Madame de L***'s health —told her, that Monſieur his maſter was <hi>au deſeſpoir</hi> for her re-eſtabliſhment from the fatigues of her journey—and, to cloſe all, that Monſieur had received the letter which Madame had done him the honour—and he has done me the honour, ſaid Madame de L***, interrupting La Fleur, to ſend a billet in return.</p>
                     <p>Madame de L*** had ſaid this with ſuch a tone of reliance upon the fact, that La Fleur had not power to diſappoint her expectations—he trembled for my honour —and poſſibly might not altogether be unconcerned for his own, as a man capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being attach'd to a maſter who

could be a wanting <hi>en egard vis a vis d'une femme</hi>; ſo that when Madame de L*** aſked La Fleur if he had brought a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>O qu'oui,</hi> ſaid La Fleur: ſo laying down his hat upon the ground, and taking hold of the flap of his right ſide pocket with his left hand, he began to ſearch for the letter with his right—then contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe—<hi>Diable!</hi>—then ſought every pocket—pocket by pocket, round, not forgetting his fob—<hi>Peſte!</hi>—then La Fleur emptied them upon the floor—pulled out a dirty cravat—a handkerchief —a comb—a whip laſh—a night-cap— then gave a peep into his hat—<hi>Quelle etourderie!</hi> He had left the letter upon the table in the Auberge—he would run for it, and be back with it in three minutes.</p>
                     <p>I had juſt finiſhed my ſupper when La Fleur came in to give me an account of his adventure: he told the whole ſtory ſimply as it was; and only added, that if Monſieur had forgot (<hi>par hazard</hi>) to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer Madame's letter, the arrangement gave him an opportunity to recover the <hi>faux pas</hi>—and if not, that things were only as they were.</p>
                     <p>Now I was not altogether ſure of my <hi>etiquette,</hi> whether I ought to have wrote or no; but if I had—a devil himſelf could not have been angry 'twas but the officious zeal of a well-meaning creature for my honour; and however he might

have miſtook the road—or embarraſſed me in ſo doing—his heart was in no fault —I was under no neceſſity to write— and what weighed more than all—he did not look as if he had done amiſs.</p>
                     <p>—'Tis all very well, La Fleur, ſaid I.</p>
                     <p>—'Twas ſufficient. La Fleur flew out of the room like lightening, and return'd with pen, ink, and paper, in his hand; and coming up to the table, laid them cloſe before me, with ſuch a delight in his countenace, that I could not help taking up the pen.</p>

                     <p>La Fleur ſtepped out and brought a little water in a glaſs to dilute my ink— then fetched ſand and ſeal-wax—It was all one—I wrote and blotted, and tore off, and burnt, and wrote again—<hi>Le Diable l'empor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te!</hi> ſaid I half to myſelf—I cannot write this ſelf-ſame letter; throwing the pen down deſpairingly as I ſaid it.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as I had caſt down the pen, La Fleur advanced with the moſt reſpectful carriage up to the table, and making a thouſand apologies for the liberty he was going to take, told me he had a letter in

his pocket wrote by a drummer in his regiment to a corporal's wife, which, he durſt ſay, would ſuit the occaſion.</p>
                     <p>I had a mind to let the poor fellow have his humour—Then prithee, ſaid I, let me ſee it.</p>
                     <p>La Fleur inſtantly pulled out a little dirty pocket book crammed full of ſmall letters and billet-doux in a ſad condition, and laying it upon the table, and then untying the ſtring which held them all together, run them over one by one, till he came to the letter in queſtion—<hi>La voila!</hi> ſaid he, clapping his hands: ſo unfolding it firſt, he laid it before me, and retired three ſteps from the table whilſt I read it.</p>

                     <p>A poor prince who is weak in cavalry, and whoſe whole infantry does not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed a ſingle man, had beſt quit the field; and ſignalize himſelf in the cabinet, if he can get up into it—I ſay <hi>up into it</hi>— for there is no deſcending perpendicular amongſt 'em with a "<hi>Me voici! mes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fans</hi>"—here I am—whatever many may think.</p>
                     <p>I own my firſt ſenſations, as ſoon as I was left ſolitary and alone in my own chamber in the hotel, were far from being ſo flattering as I had prefigured them.

                     <p>WHEN the barber came, he abſolutely refuſed to have any thing to do with my wig: 'twas either above or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his art: I had nothing to do, but to take one ready made of his own recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation.</p>

                     <p>What a great ſcale is every thing upon in this city! thought I—the utmoſt ſtretch of an Engliſh periwig-maker's ideas could have gone no further than to have
<q>dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped it into a pail of water</q>
—What difference! 'tis like time to eternity.</p>
                     <p>I confeſs I do hate all cold conceptions, as I do the puny ideas which engender them; and am generally ſo ſtruck with the great works of nature, that for my own part, if I could help it, I never would make a compariſon leſs than a mountain at leaſt. All that can be ſaid againſt the French ſublime in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it, is this—that the grandeur is <hi>more</hi> in the <hi>word;</hi> and <hi>leſs</hi> in the <hi>thing.</hi> No doubt the ocean fills the mind with vaſt ideas; but Paris being ſo far inland, it was not likely I ſhould run poſt a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles out of it, to try the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment—the Pariſian barber meant nothing.</p>
                     <p>The pail of water ſtanding beſides the great deep, makes certainly but a ſorry figure in ſpeech—but 'twill be ſaid—it has one advantage—'tis in the next room, and the truth of the buckle may be tried in it without more ado, in a ſingle mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                     <p>I was ſo long in getting from under my barber's hands, that it was too late of thinking of going with my letter to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame R*** that night: but when a man is once dreſſed at all points for going out, his reflections turn to little account, ſo taking down the name of the Hotel de Modene where I lodged, I walked forth without any determination where to go— I ſhall conſider of that, ſaid I, as I walk along.</p>

                     <p>I had given a caſt with my eye into half a dozen ſhops as I came along in ſearch of a face not likely to be diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſuch an interruption; till at laſt, this hitting my fancy, I had walked in.</p>
                     <p>She was working a pair of ruffles as ſhe ſat in a low chair on the far ſide of the ſhop facing the door—</p>

<q>This wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is grateful</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>You muſt turn, Monſieur, ſaid ſhe, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with me to the door of the ſhop, and pointing the way down the ſtreet I was to take—you muſt turn firſt to your left hand—<hi>mais prenez guarde</hi>—there are two turns; and be ſo good as to take the ſecond—then go down a little way and you'll ſee a church, and when you are paſt it, give yourſelf the trouble to turn directly to the right, and that will lead you to the foot of the <hi>pont neuf,</hi> which

                     <p>She repeated her inſtructions three times over to me with the ſame good natured patience the third time as the firſt;—and if <hi>tones and manners</hi> have a meaning, which certainly they have, unleſs to hearts which ſhut them out—ſhe ſeemed really intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that I ſhould not loſe myſelf.</p>
                     <p>I will not ſuppoſe it was the woman's beauty, notwithſtanding ſhe was the handſomeſt griſſet, I think, I ever ſaw, which had much to do with the ſenſe I had of her courteſy; only I remember, when I told her how much I was obliged to her, that I looked very full in her eyes —and that I repeated my thanks as often as ſhe had done her inſtructions.</p>
                     <p>I had not got ten paces from the door, before I found I had forgot every tittle of what ſhe had ſaid—ſo looking back, and ſeeing her ſtill ſtanding in the door of the ſhop as if to look whether I went right or not—I returned back, to aſk her whether the firſt turn was to my right or left—for that I had abſolutely forgot.— It is poſſible! ſaid ſhe, half laughing. —'Tis very poſſible, replied I, when a man is thinking more of a woman, than of her good advice.</p>
                     <p>As this was the real truth—ſhe took it, as every woman takes a matter of right, with a ſlight courteſy.</p>

                     <p>In Paris, there are ſcarce two orders of beings more different: for the legiſlative and executive powers of the ſhop not reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the husband, he ſeldom comes there—in ſome dark and diſmal room be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, he ſits commerceleſs in his thrum night-cap, the ſame rough ſon of nature that nature left him.</p>

a ſingle pair, which ſeemed to be the leaſt—She held it open— my hand ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped into it at once—It will not do, ſaid I, ſhaking my head a little—No, ſaid ſhe, doing the ſame thing.</p>

I not reſcue one page from violation by writing his name in it, and telling the world it was Captain Tobias Shandy, the deareſt of my flock and friends, whoſe philanthropy I never think of at this long diſtance from his death—but my eyes guſh out with tears. For his ſake, I have a predilection for the whole corps of Vete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans; and ſo I ſtrode over the two back rows of benches, and placed myſelf beſide him.</p>
                     <p>The old officer was reading attentively a ſmall pamphlet, it might be the book of the opera, with a large pair of ſpectacles, As ſoon as I ſat down, he took his ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles off, and putting them into a ſhagreen caſe, returned them and the book into his pocket together, I half roſe up, and made him a bow.</p>
                     <p>Tranſlate this into any civilized lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage in the world—the ſenſe is this:</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Here's a poor ſtranger come into the box—he ſeems as if he knew no body; and is never likely, was he to be ſeven years in Paris, if every man he comes near keeps his ſpectacles upon his noſe —'tis ſhutting the door of converſation abſolutely in his face—and uſing him worſe than a German.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The French officer might as well have ſaid it aloud; and if he had, I ſhould in courſe have put the bow I made him into French too, and told him,
<q>I was ſenſible
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:041886_0087_101B637AC553A9A8"/>
of his attention, and returned him a thouſand thanks for it.</q>

                     <p>There is not a ſecret ſo aiding to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of ſociality, as to get maſter of this <hi>ſhort hand,</hi> and be quick in rendering the ſeveral turns of looks and limbs, with all their inflections and delineations, into plain words. For my own part, by long habitude, I do it ſo mechanically, that when I walk the ſtreets of London, I go tranſlating all the way; and have more than once ſtood behind in the circle, where not three words have been ſaid, and have brought off twenty different di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogues with me, which I could have fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrote down and ſworn to.</p>
                     <p>I was going one evening to Martini's concert at Milan, and was juſt entering the door of the hall, when the Marqueſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na di F*** was coming out in a ſort of a hurry—ſhe was almoſt upon me before I ſaw her; ſo I gave a ſpring to one ſide to let her paſs—She had done the ſame, and on the ſame ſide too; ſo we ran our heads together: ſhe inſtantly got to the other ſide to get out. I was juſt as unfortunate as ſhe had been; for I had ſprung to that ſide, and oppoſed her paſſage again— we both flew together to the other ſide, and then back—and ſo on—it was ridiculous; we both bluſhed intollerably; ſo I did at laſt the thing I ſhould have done at firſt—I ſtood ſtock ſtill, and the
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:041886_0088_101B63C06F635CE8"/>
Marqueſina had no more difficulty, I had no power to go into the room, till I had made her ſo much reparation as to wait and follow her with my eye to the end of the paſſage—She looked back twice, and walked along it rather ſide-ways, as if ſhe would make room for any one coming up ſtairs to paſs her—No, ſaid I—that's a vile tranſlation: the Marqueſina has a right to the beſt apology I can make her; and that opening is left for me to do it in —ſo I ran and begged pardon for the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baraſſment I had given her, ſaying it was my intention to have made her way. She anſwered ſhe was guided by the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention towards me—ſo we reciprocally thanked each other. She was at the top of the ſtairs; and ſeeing no <hi>chicheſbee</hi> near her, I begged to hand her to her coach— ſo we went down the ſtairs, ſtopping at every third ſtep to talk of the concert and the adventure—Upon my word, Madame, ſaid I when I had handed her in, I made ſix different efforts to let you go out— And<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I made ſix efforts, replied ſhe, to let you enter—I wiſh to heaven you would make a ſeventh, ſaid I—With all my heart ſaid ſhe, making room—Life is too ſhort to be long about the forms of it—ſo I inſtantly ſtepped in, and ſhe carried me home with her—And what became of the concert, St. Cecilia, who, I ſuppoſe, was at it, knows more than I.</p>

                     <head>THE DWARF. PARIS.</head>
                     <p>I HAD never heard the remark made by any one in my life, except by one; and who that was, will probably come out in this chapter; ſo that being pretty much unprepoſſeſſed, there muſt have been grounds for what ſtruck me the moment I caſt my eyes over the <hi>parterre</hi>—and that was, the unaccountable ſport of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in forming ſuch numbers of dwarfs —No doubt, ſhe ſports at certain times in almoſt every corner of the world; but in Paris, there is no end to her amuſements —The goddeſs ſeems almoſt as merry as ſhe is wiſe.</p>
                     <p>As I carried my idea out of the <hi>opera comique</hi> with me, I meaſured every body I ſaw walking in the ſtreets by it—Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly application! eſpecially where the ſize was extremely little—the face ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely dark—the eyes quick—the noſe long—the teeth white—the jaw promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:041886_0090_101B63C533C1DCD8"/>
—to ſee ſo many miſerables, by force of accidents driven out of their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per claſs into the very verge of another, which it gives me pain to write down— every third man a pigmy!—ſome by rick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etty heads and hump backs—others by bandy legs—a third ſet arreſted by the hand of nature in the ſixth and ſeventh years of their growth—a fourth, in their perfect and natural ſtate, like dwarf ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-trees: from the firſt rudiments and ſtamina of their exiſtence, never meant to grow higher.</p>
                     <p>A medical traveller might ſay, 'tis ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to undue bandages—a ſplenetic one, to want of air—and an inquiſitive travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, to fortify the ſyſtem, may meaſure the height of their houſes—the narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their ſtreets, and in how few feet ſquare in the ſixth and ſeventh ſtories ſuch numbers of the <hi>Bourgoiſie</hi> eat and ſleep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; but I remember Mr. Shandy the elder, who accounted for nothing like a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny body elſe, in ſpeaking one evening of theſe matters, averred, that children, like other animals, might be encreaſed almoſt to any ſize, provided they came right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world; but the miſery was, the citizens of Paris were ſo cooped up, that they had not actually room enough to get them—I do not call it getting any thing, ſaid he—'tis getting nothing—Nay, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, riſing in his argument, 'tis

getting worſe than nothing, when all you have got, after twenty or five and twenty years of the tendereſt care and moſt nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious aliment beſtowed upon it, ſhall not at laſt be as high as my leg. Now, Mr. Shandy being very ſhort, there could be nothing more ſaid upon it.</p>
                     <p>As this is not a work of reaſoning, I leave the ſolution as I found it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent myſelf with the truth only of the remark, which is verified in every lane and by-lane of Paris. I was walking down that which leads from the Carouſal to the Palais Royal, and obſerving a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle boy in ſome diſtreſs at the ſide of the gutter, which ran down the middle of it, I took hold of his hand, and helped him over. Upon turning up his face to look at him after, I perceived he was about forty. —Never mind, ſaid I; ſome good body will do as much for me when I am ninety,</p>
                     <p>I feel ſome little principles within me, which incline me to be merciful towards this poor blighted part of my ſpecies, who have neither ſize or ſtrength to get on in the world—I cannot hear to ſee one of them and upon; and had ſcarce got ſeated beſide my old French officer, ere the diſguſt was exerciſed by ſeeing the very thing happen under the box we ſat in.</p>
                     <p>At the end of the orcheſtra, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt that and the firſt ſide box, there is a ſmall eſplanade left, where, when the
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:041886_0092_101B63C6D0A98C78"/>
houſe is full, numbers of all ranks take ſanctuary. Though you ſtand, as in the parterre, you pay the ſame price as in the orcheſtra. A poor defenceleſs being of this order had got thruſt ſome how or other into this luckleſs place—the night was hot, and he was ſurrounded by beings two feet and a half higher than himſelf. The dwarf ſuffered inexpreſſibly on all ſides; but the thing which incommoded him moſt, was a tall corpulent German, near ſeven feet high, who ſtood directly betwixt him and all poſſibility of his ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either, the ſtage or the actors. The poor dwarf did all he could to get a peep at what was going forwards, by ſeeking for ſome little opening betwixt the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's arm and his body, trying firſt one ſide, then the other; but the German ſtood ſquare in the moſt unaccommodat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poſture that can be imagined—the dwarf might as well have been placed at the bottom of the deepeſt draw-well in Paris; ſo he civilly reached up his hand to the German's ſleeve, and told him his diſtreſs—The German turned his head back, looked down upon him as Goliah did upon David—and unfeelingly reſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his poſture.</p>
                     <p>I was juſt then taking a pinch of ſnuff out of my monk's little horn box—And how would thy meek and courteous ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, my dear monk! ſo tempered to <hi>bear

and forbear!</hi>—how ſweetly would it have lent an ear to this poor ſoul's complaint!</p>
                     <p>The old French officer ſeeing me lift up my eyes with an emotion, as I made the apoſtrophe, took the liberty to aſk me what was the matter—I told him the ſtory in three words; and added, how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human it was.</p>
                     <p>By this time the dwarf was driven to extremes, and in his firſt tranſports, which are generally unreaſonable, had told the German he would cut off his long queue with his knife—The German look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back coolly and told him he was wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come if he could reach it.</p>
                     <p>An injury ſharpened by an inſult, be it to who it will, makes every man of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent a party: I could have leaped out of the box to have redreſſed it.—The old French officer did it with much leſs confuſion; for leaning a little over, and nodding to a centinel and pointing at the ſame time with his finger to the diſtreſs— the centinel made his way up to it.— There was no occaſion to tell the griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance—the thing told itſelf; ſo thruſting back the German inſtantly with his muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket—he took the poor dwarf by the hand and placed him before him.—This is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble! ſaid I, clapping my hands together —And yet you would not permit this, ſaid the old officer, in England.</p>
                     <p>—In England, dear Sir, ſaid I, <hi>we ſit all at our eaſe.</hi>

                     <p>IT was now my turn to aſk the old French officer
<q>What was the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</q>
for a cry of
<q>Hauſſez les mains, Monſieur l' Abbe,</q>
re-echoed from a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen different parts of the parterre, was as unintelligible to me, as my apoſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe to the monk had been to him.</p>
                     <p>He told me, it was ſome poor Abbe in one of the upper loges, who he ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed had got planted perdu behind a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of griſſets in order to ſee the opera, and that the paterre eſpying him, were inſiſting upon his holding up both his hands during the repreſentation.—And can it be ſuppoſed, ſaid I, that an eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick would pick the Griſſet's pockets? The old French officer ſmiled, and whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering in my ear, opened a door of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which I had no idea of.</p>
                     <p>Good God! ſaid I, turning pale with aſtoniſhment—is it poſſible, that a people

ſo ſmit with ſentiment ſhould at the ſame time be ſo unclean, and ſo unlike them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves—<hi>Quelle groſſierte!</hi> added I.</p>
                     <p>The French officer told me, it was an illiberal ſarcaſm at the church, which had begun in the theatre about the time the Tartuffe was given in it by Moliere—but, like other remains of Gothic manners, was declining—Every nation, continued he, have their refinements and <hi>groſſiertes,</hi> in which they take the lead, and loſe it of one another by turns—that he had been in moſt countries, but never in one where he found not ſome delicacies, which others ſeemed to want <hi>Le</hi> POUR, <hi>et le</hi> CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRE <hi>ſe trouvent en chaque nation;</hi> there is a balance, ſaid he, of good and bad every where; and nothing but the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is ſo can emancipate one half of the world from the prepoſſeſſions which it holds againſt the other—that the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of travel, as it regarded the <hi>ſeavoir vivre,</hi> was by ſeeing a great deal both of men and manners; it taught us mutual toleration; and mutual toleration, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded he, making me a bow, taught us mutual love.</p>
                     <p>The old French officer delivered this with an air of ſuch candour and good ſenſe, as coincided with my firſt favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able impreſſions of his character—I tho't I loved the man; but I fear I miſtook the object—'twas my own way of thinking—
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:041886_0096_101B63CDEABBF8D0"/>
the difference was, I could not have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed it half ſo well.</p>
                     <p>It is alike troubleſome to both the rider and his beaſt—if the latter goes pricking up his ears, and ſtarting all the way at every object which he never ſaw before— I have as little torment of this kind as any creature alive; and yet I honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confeſs, that many a thing gave me pain, and that I bluſhed at many a word the firſt month—which I found inconſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and perfectly innocent the ſecond.</p>

                  <p>The bookſeller ſaid he had not a ſet in the world—<hi>Comment!</hi> ſaid I; taking one up out of a ſet which lay upon the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter betwixt us.—He ſaid, they were ſent him only to be got bound, and were to be ſent back to Verſailles in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Count de B * * * *.</p>
                  <p>—And does the Count de B * * * * ſaid I, read Shakeſpear? <hi>C'eſt un Eſprit fort</hi>; replied the bookſeller.—He loves Engliſh books; and what is more to his honour, Monſieur, he love the Engliſh too. You ſpeak this ſo civilly, ſaid I, that 'tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to oblige an Engliſhman to lay out a Louis d'or or two at your ſhop—the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:041886_0099_101B64CDD1692B28"/>
bookſeller made a bow, and was going to ſay ſomething, when a young decent girl of about twenty, who by her air and dreſs, ſeemed to be <hi>fille de chambre</hi> to ſome devout woman of faſhion, came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſhop and aſked for <hi>Les Egarments du Coeur and de l'Eſprit:</hi> the bookſeller gave her the book directly; ſhe pulled out a little green ſattin purſe run round with a ribband of the ſame colour, and putting her finger and thumb into it, ſhe took out the money, and paid for it. As I had nothing more to ſtay me in the ſhop, we both walked out at the door to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                  <p>—And what have you to do, my dear, ſaid I, with <hi>The wanderings of the heart,</hi> who ſcarce know yet you have one? nor till love has firſt told you it, or ſome faithleſs ſhepherd has made it ache, can'ſt thou ever be ſure it is ſo.—<hi>Le Dieu m'en guer<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The young girl liſtened with a ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive attention, holding her ſattin purſe by its ribband in her hand all the time —'Tis a very ſmall one, ſaid I, taking hold of the bottom of it—ſhe held it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me—and there is very little in it, my dear, ſaid I; but be but as good as
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:041886_0100_101B641214F07D28"/>
thou art handſome, and heaven will fill it: I had a parcel of crowns in my hand to pay for Shakeſpear; and as ſhe had let go the purſe intirely I put a ſingle one in; and tying up the ribband in a bow-knot, returned it to her.</p>
                  <p>The young girl made me more a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble courteſy than a low one—'twas one of thoſe quiet, thankful ſinkings where the ſpirit bows itſelf down—the body does no more than tell it. I never gave a girl a crown in my life which gave me half the pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>My advice, my dear, would not have been worth a pin to you, ſaid I, if I had not given this along with it: but now, when you ſee the crown, you'll remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it—ſo don't, my dear, lay it out in ribbands.</p>
                  <p>Upon my word, Sir, ſaid the girl, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netſly, I am incapable—in ſaying which, as is uſual in little bargains of honour, ſhe gave me her hand—<hi>En verite, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur, je mettrai cet argent apart,</hi> ſaid ſhe.</p>
                  <p>When a virtuous convention is made betwixt man and woman, it ſanctifies their moſt private walks: ſo notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was duſky, yet as both our roads lay the ſame way, we made no ſcruple of walking along the Quai de Conti together.</p>
                  <p>She made me a ſecond courteſy in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off, and before we got twenty yards from the door, as if ſhe had not done me enough before, ſhe made a ſort of a
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:041886_0101_101B5884994066B8"/>
little ſtop to tell me again—ſhe thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me.</p>
                  <p>It was a ſmall tribute, I told her, which I could not avoid paying to virtue, and would not be miſtaken in the perſon I had been rendering it to for the world— but I ſee innocence, my dear, in your face—and ſoul befal the man who ever lays a ſnare in its way!</p>
                  <p>The girl ſeemed affected ſome way or other with what I ſaid—ſhe gave a low ſigh—I found I was not impowered to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire at all after it—ſo ſaid nothing more till I got to the corner of the Rue de Nevers, where we were to part.</p>
                  <p>—But is this the way, my dear, ſaid I, to the hotel de Modene? ſhe told me it was—or, that I might go by the Rue de Guineygaude, which was the next turn. —Then I'll go, my dear, by the Rue de Guineygaude, ſaid I, for two reaſons; firſt I ſhall pleaſe myſelf, and next I ſhall give you the protection of my company as far on your way as I can. The girl was ſenſible I was civil, and ſaid, ſhe wiſhed the hotel de Modene was in the Rue de St. Pierre—You live there? ſaid I.—She told me ſhe was <hi>fille de chambre</hi> to Madame R * * * *! Good God ſaid I, 'tis the very lady for whom I have brought a letter from Amiens—The girl told me that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame R * * * *, ſhe believed expected a ſtranger with a letter, and was impatient
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:041886_0102_101B6414F56B6270"/>
to ſee him—ſo I deſired the girl to preſent my compliments to Madame R * * * *, and ſay I would certainly wait upon her in the morning.</p>
                  <p>We ſtood ſtill at the corner of the Rue de Nevers whilſt this paſs'd—We than ſtop'd a moment whilſt ſhe diſpoſed of her <hi>Egarments de Coeur,</hi> &amp;c. more commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly than carrying them in her hand— they were two volumes, ſo I held the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond for her whilſt ſhe put the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her pocket; and then ſhe held her pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, and I put in the other after it.</p>
                  <p>'Tis ſweet to feel by what fine-ſpun threads our affections are drawn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>We ſet off a-freſh, and as ſhe took her third ſtep, the girl put her hand within my arm—I was juſt bidding her—but ſhe did it of herſelf with that undeliberating ſimplicity, which ſhewed it was out of her head that ſhe had never ſeen me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. For my own part, I felt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of conſauguinity ſo ſtrongly, that I could not help turning half round to look in her face, and ſee if I could trace out any thing in it of a family likeneſs— Tut! ſaid I, are we not all relations?</p>
                  <p>When we arrived at the turning up of the Rue de Guineygaude, I ſtopped to bid her adieu for good an all, the girl would thank me again for my company and kindneſs—She bid me adieu twice—I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated it as often; and ſo cordial was the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:041886_0103_101B63D0F52A7558"/>
parting between us, that had it happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any where elſe, I am not ſure but I ſhould have ſigned it with a kiſs of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as warm and holy as an apoſtle.</p>
                  <p>But in Paris, as none kiſs each other but the men—I did, what amounted to the ſame thing—</p>
                  <p>—I bid God bleſs her.</p>

                     <p>WHEN I got home to my hotel, La Fleur told me I had been enquired after by the Lieutenant de Police—The duce take it! ſaid I—I know the reaſon. It is time the reader ſhould know it, for in the order of things in which it happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it was omitted; not that it was out of my head; but that had I told it then, it might have been forgot new—and now is the time I want it.</p>
                     <p>I had left London with ſo much preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation, that it never entered my mind that we were at war with France; and had reached Dover, and look'd through my glaſs at the hills beyond Boulovne, before the idea preſented itſelf; and with this in its train, that there was no get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

there without a paſſort, Go but to the end of a ſtreet I have a mortal averſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for returning back no wiſer than I ſat out; and as this was one of the greateſt efforts I had ever made for knowledge, I could leſs bear the thoughts of it: ſo hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Count de * * * * had hired the packet, I begged he would take me in his <hi>ſuite.</hi> The Count had ſome little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of me, ſo made little or no difficulty —only ſaid, his inclination to ſerve me could reach no further than Calais; as he was to return by way of Bruſſels to Paris: however, when I once paſs'd there, I might get to Paris without interruption, but that in Paris I muſt make friends and ſhift for myſelf.—Let me get to Paris, Monſieur le Count, ſaid I—and I ſhall do very well. So I embark'd, and never thought more of the matter.</p>
                     <p>When Le Fleur told me the Lieutenant de Police had been enquiring after me— the thing inſtantly recured—and by the time Le Fleur had well told me, the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the hotel came into my room to tell me the ſame thing, with this addition to it, that my paſſport had been particularly aſked after: the maſter of the hotel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with ſaying, he hoped I had one. —Not I, faith! ſaid I.</p>
                     <p>The maſter of the hotel retired three ſteps from me, as from an infected perſon as I declared this—and poor Le Fleur ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced

three ſteps towards me, and with that ſort of movement which a good ſoul makes to ſuccour a diſtreſſed one—the fellow won my heart by it; and from that ſingle <hi>trait,</hi> I know his character as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, and could rely upon it as firmly, as if he had ſerved me with fidelity for ſeven years.</p>
                     <p>Mon ſeignior! cried the maſter of the hotel—but recollecting himſelf as he made the exclamation, he inſtantly chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the tone of it.—If Monſieur, ſaid he, has not a paſſport (<hi>apparament</hi>) in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood he has friends in Paris who can procure him one.—Not that I know of, quoth I, with an air of indifference.— Then <hi>certes,</hi> replied he, you'll be ſent to the baſtile or the chatelet, <hi>ou moins.</hi> Poo! ſaid I, the king of France is a good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured ſoul—he'll hurt no body.—<hi>Cela n'empeche pas,</hi> ſaid he—you will certainly be ſent to the baſtile to-morrow morning. —But I've taken your lodgings for a month, anſwered I, and I'll not quit them a day before the time for all the kings of France in the world.

                     <p>I COULD not find in my heart to torture La Fleur's with a ſerious look upon the ſubject of my embarraſſment, which was the reaſon I had treated it ſo cavalierly: and to ſhew him how light it lay upon my mind, I dropt the ſubject en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely; and whilſt he waited upon me at ſupper, talked to him with more than uſual gaiety about Paris, and of the opera comique—La Fleur had been there him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and had followed me through the ſtreets as far as the bookſeller's ſhop; but ſeeing me come out with the young <hi>fille de chambre,</hi> and that we walked down the Quai de Conti together, La Fleur deem'd it unneceſſary to follow me a ſtep further —ſo making his own reflections upon it, he took a ſhorter cut, and got to the hotel in time to be informed of the affair of the Police againſt my arrival.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as the honeſt creature had taken away, and gone down to ſup him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, I then began to think a little ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about my ſituation.—</p>
                     <p>—And here, I know, Eugenius, thou wilt ſmile at the remembrance of a ſhort dialogue which paſſed betwixt us the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:041886_0107_101B63D55D7B4978"/>
moment I was going to ſet out—I muſt tell it here.</p>
                     <p>Eugenius, knowing that I was as little ſubject to be overburthened with money as thought, had drawn me aſide to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate me how much I had taken care for; upon telling him the exact ſum, Eugenius ſhook his head, and ſaid it would not do; ſo pulled out his purſe in order to empty it into mine.—I've enough in conſcience, Eugenius, ſaid I.—Indeed, Yorick, you have not, replied Eugenius— I know France and Italy better than you —But you don't conſider, Eugenius, ſaid I, refuſing his offer, that before I have been three days in Paris, I ſhall take care to ſay or do ſomething or other for which I ſhall get clapped up into the Baſtile, and that I ſhall live there a couple of months entirely at the king of France's expence.—I beg pardon, ſaid Eugenius, drily: really, I had forgot that reſource.</p>
                     <p>Now the event I treated gaily came ſeriouſly to my door.</p>
                     <p>Is it folly, or nonchalance, or philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, or pertinacity—or what is it in me, that, after all, when La Fleur had gone down ſtairs, and I was quite alone, that I could not bring down my mind to think of it otherwiſe than I had then ſpoken of it to Eugenius?</p>
                     <p>— And as for the Baſtile! the terror is in the word—Make the moſt of it you
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:041886_0108_101B641B64CE0328"/>
can, ſaid I to myſelf, the Baſtile is but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother word for a tower—and a tower is but another word for a houſe you can't get out of—Mercy on the gouty! for they are in it twice a year—but with nine livres a day, and pen and ink and paper and patience, albeit a man can't get out, he may do very well within —at leaſt for a month or ſix weeks; at the end of which, if he is a harmleſs fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his innocence appears, and he comes out a better and wiſer man than he went in.</p>
                     <p>I had ſome occaſion (I forget what) to ſtep into the court-yard, as I ſettled this account; and remember I walked down ſtairs in no ſmall triumph with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of my reaſoning—Beſhrew the <hi>ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre</hi> pencil! ſaid I vauntingly—for I envy not its powers, which paints the evils of life with ſo hard and deadly a colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The mind ſits terrified at the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſhe has magnified herſelf, and black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened: reduce them to their proper ſize and hue ſhe overlooks them—'Tis true, ſaid I, correcting the propoſition—the Baſtile is not an evil to be deſpiſed—but ſtrip it of its towers—fill up the foſſè— unbarricade the doors—call it ſimply a confinement, and ſuppoſe 'tis ſome ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of a diſtemper—and not of a man which holds you in it—the evil vaniſhes, and you bear the other half without complaint.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="14" facs="unknown:041886_0109_101B63DBF5DF9488"/>I was interrupted in the hey-day of this ſoliloquy, with a voice which I took to be of a child, which complained
<q>it could not get out.</q>
—I looked up and down the paſſage, and ſeeing neither man, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or child, I went out without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther attention.</p>
                     <p>In my return back through the paſſage, I heard the ſame words repeated twice o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and looking up, I ſaw it was a ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling hung in a little cage.—
<q>I can't get out—I can't get out,</q>
ſaid the ſtarling.</p>
                     <p>I ſtood looking at the bird: and to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very perſon who came through the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage it ran fluttering to the ſide towards which they approached it, with the ſame lamentation of its captivity—
<q>I can't get out</q>,
ſaid the ſtarling—God help thee! ſaid I, but I'll let thee out, coſt what it will; ſo I turned about the cage to get to the door; it was twiſted and double twiſted ſo faſt with wire, there was no getting it open without pulling the cage to pieces—I took both hands to it.</p>
                     <p>The bird flew to the place where I was attempting his deliverance, and thruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his head through the trellis, preſſed his breaſt againſt it, as if impatient— I fear poor creature! ſaid I, I cannot ſet thee at liberty—"No," ſaid the ſtarling— "I can't get out—I can't get out," ſaid the ſtarling.</p>

Mechanical as the notes were, yet ſo true in tune to nature were they chanted, that in one moment they overthrew all my ſyſtematic reaſonings upon the Baſtile; and I heavily walked up ſtairs, unſaying every word I had ſaid in going down them.</p>

                     <p>THE bird in his cage purſued me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my room; I ſat down cloſe to my table, and leaning my head upon my hand, I begun to figure to myſelf the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of confinement. I was in a right frame for it, and ſo I gave full ſcope to my imagination.</p>
                     <p>I was going to begin with the millions of my fellow creatures born to no inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance but ſlavery; but finding however affecting the picture was, that I could not bring it near me, and that the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ſad groups in it did but diſtract me.—</p>
                     <p>—I took a ſingle captive, and having firſt ſhut him up in his dungeon, I then looked through the twilight of his grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed door to take his picture.</p>
                     <p>I beheld his body half waſted away with long expectation and confinement, and felt what kind of ſickneſs of the heart it was which ariſes from hope de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred. Upon looking nearer I ſaw him
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:041886_0112_101B64240F9FC568"/>
pale and feveriſh: in thirty years the weſtern breeze had not once fanned his blood—he had ſeen no ſun, no moon in all that time—nor had the voice of friend or kinſman breathed through his latice —his children—</p>
                     <p>—But here my heart began to bleed— and I was forced to go on with another part of the portrait.</p>
                     <p>He was ſitting upon the ground upon a little ſtraw, in the furtheſt corner of his dungeon, which was alternately his chair and bed: a little calender of ſmall ſticks were laid at the head notch'd all over with the diſmal days and nights he had paſs'd there—he had one of theſe little ſticks in his hand, and with a ruſty nail he was etching another day of miſery to add to the heap. As I darkened the little light he had, he lifted up a hopeleſs eye towards the door, then caſt it down— ſhook his head, and went on with his work of affliction. I heard his chains up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his legs, as he turn'd his body to lay his little ſtick upon the bundle—he gave a deep ſigh—I ſaw the iron enter into his ſoul—I burſt into tears—I could not ſuſtain the picture of confinement which my fancy had drawn—I ſtartled up from my chair, and calling La Fleur, I bid him beſpeak me a <hi>remiſe,</hi> and have it ready at the door of the hotel by nine in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

                     <p>At Paris the lad had laid out a livre in a little cage for the ſtarling, and as he had little to do better the five months his maſter ſtay'd there, he taught it in his mother's tongue the four ſimple words— (and no more)—to which I own'd myſelf ſo much it's debtor.</p>
                     <p>Upon his maſter's going on for Italy— the lad had given it to the maſter of the hotel—But his little ſong for liberty, being in an <hi>unknown</hi> language at Paris—the bird had little or no ſtore ſet by him—ſo La Fleur bought both him and his cage for me for a bottle of Burgundy.</p>
                     <p>In my return from Italy I brought him with me to the country in whoſe lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage he had learn'd his notes—and tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtory of him to Lord A—Lord A begg'd the bird of me—in a week Lord A gave him to Lord B—Lord B made a preſent of him to Lord C—and Lord's C's gentleman ſold him to Lord D's for a ſhilling—Lord D gave him to Lord E— and ſo on—half round the alphabet—from that rank he paſs'd into the lower houſe, and paſs'd the hands of as many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners—But as all theſe wanted to <hi>get in</hi>—and my bird wanted to get out—he had almoſt as little ſtore ſet by him in London as in Paris.</p>

                     <p>How many mean plans of dirty addreſs as I went along, did my ſervile heart form! I deſerved the Baſtile for every one of them.</p>
                     <p>Then nothing would ſerve me, when I got within ſight of Verſailles, but putting words and ſentences together, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving attitudes and tones to wreath my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into Monſieur le Duc de C*****'s good graces—This will do—ſaid I—juſt as well, retorted I again, as a coat carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to him by an adventurous taylor, without taking his meaſure—Fool! con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued I—ſee Monſieur le Duc's face firſt —obſerve what character is written in it, take notice in what poſture he ſtands to hear you—mark the turns and expreſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of his body and limbs—And for the tone

—the firſt ſound which comes from his lips will give it you; and from all theſe together, you'll compound an addreſs at once upon the ſpot, which cannot diſguſt the Duke—the ingredients are his own, and moſt likely to go down.</p>

                     <p>—And there you are wrong again, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied I—A heart at eaſe, Yorick, flies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to no extremes—'tis ever on its center.— Well! well! cried I, as the coachman, turned in at the gates—I find I ſhall do very well: and by the time he had wheeled round the court, and brought me up to the door, I found myſelf ſo much the better for my own lecture, that I neither aſcended the ſteps like a victim to juſtice, who was to part with life up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the topmoſt,—nor did I mount them
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:041886_0118_101B642D6D3A6268"/>
with a ſkip and a couple of ſtrides, as I do when I fly up, Eliza! to thee, to meet it.</p>
                     <p>As I entered the door of the ſaloon, I was met by a perſon who poſſibly might be the maitre d'hotel, but had more the air of one of the under ſecretaries, who told me the Duc de C**** was buſy— I am utterly ignorant, ſaid I, of the forms of obtaining an audience, being an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute ſtranger, and what is worſe in the preſent conjuncture of affairs, being an Engliſhman too.—He replied, that did not increaſe the difficulty.—I made him a ſlight bow, and told him, I had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of importance to ſay to Monſieur le Duc. The ſecretary looked towards the ſtairs, as if he was about to leave me to carry up this account to ſome one—But I muſt not miſlead you, ſaid I—for what I have to ſay is of no manner of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to Monſieur le Duc de C****—but of great importance to myſelf.—<hi>C'eſt une autre affaire,</hi> replied he—Not at all, ſaid I, to a man of gallantry.—But pray, good ſir, continued I, when can a ſtranger hope to have <hi>acceſſe?</hi> In not leſs than two hours, ſaid he, looking at his watch. The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of equipages in the court yard ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to juſtify the calculation, that I could have no nearer a proſpect—and as walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing backwards and forwards in the ſaloon without a ſoul to commune with, was for
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:041886_0119_101B63E6FA520DC0"/>
the time as bad as being in the baſtile it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, I inſtantly went back to my <hi>remiſe,</hi> and bid the coachman drive me to the <hi>cordon bleu,</hi> which was the neareſt hotel.</p>
                     <p>I think there is a fatality in it—I ſeldom go to the place I ſet out for.</p>

                     <head>LE PATISSER. VERSAILLES.</head>
                     <p>BEFORE I had got half-way down the ſtreet, I changed my mind: as I am at Verſailles, thought I, I might as well take a view of the town; ſo I pulled the cord, and ordered the coachman to drive round ſome of the principal ſtreets —I ſuppoſe the town is not very large, ſaid I—The coachmen begged pardon for ſetting me right, and told me it was very ſuperb, and that numbers of the firſt dukes and marquiſes and counts had hotels— The Count de B****, of whom the book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller at the Quai de Conti had ſpoke ſo handſomely the night before, came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly into my mind.—And why ſhould I not go, thought I, to the Count de B**** who has ſo high an idea of Engliſh books, and Engliſhmen—and tell him my ſtory!
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:041886_0120_101B643059078050"/>
ſo I changed my mind a ſecond time—In truth it was the third; for I had intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that day for Madame de R**** in the Rue St. Pierre, and had devoutly ſent her word by her <hi>fille de chambre</hi> that I would aſſuredly wait upon her—but I am govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by circumſtances—I cannot govern them: ſo ſeeing a man ſtanding with a baſket on the other ſide of the ſtreet, as if he had ſomething to ſell, I bid La Fleur go up to him and enquire for the Count's hotel.</p>
                     <p>La Fleur returned a little pale; and told me it was a Chevalier de St. Louis ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>pates</hi>—It is impoſſible, La Fleur! ſaid I.—La Fleur could no more account for the phenomenon than myſelf; but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in his ſtory: he had ſeen the croix ſet in gold, with its red ribband, he ſaid, tied to his button-hole—and had looked into the baſket and ſeen the <hi>pates</hi> which the Chevalier was ſelling; ſo could not be miſtaken in that.</p>
                     <p>Such a reverſe in man's life awakens a better principle than curioſity: I could not help looking for ſome time at him as I ſat in the <hi>remiſe</hi>—the more I looked at him—his croix and his baſket, the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they wove themſelves into my brain— I got out of the <hi>remiſe</hi> and went towards him.</p>
                     <p>He was begirt with a clean linen apron which fell below his knees, and with a
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:041886_0121_101B63E9AD1E9538"/>
ſort of a bib went half way up his breaſt; upon the top of this, but a little below the hem, hung his croix. His baſket of little <hi>pates</hi> was covered over with a white damaſk napkin; another of the ſame kind was ſpread at the bottom; and there was a look <hi>proprete</hi> and neatneſs through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; that one might have bought his <hi>pates</hi> of him, as much from appetite as ſentiment.</p>
                     <p>He made an offer of them to neither: but ſtood ſtill with them at the corner of a hotel, for thoſe to buy who choſe it, without ſolicitation.</p>
                     <p>He was about forty-eight—of a ſedate look, ſomething approaching to gravity. I did not wonder—I went up rather to the baſket than him, and having lifted up the napkin and taken one of his <hi>pates</hi> into my hand—I begged he would explain the appearance which affected me.</p>
                     <p>He told me in a few words, that the beſt part of his life had paſſed in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, in which, after ſpending a ſmall patrimony, he had obtained a company and the croix with it; but that at the concluſion of the laſt peace, his regiment being reformed, and the whole corps, with thoſe of ſome other regiments, left without any proviſion—he found himſelf in a wide world without friends, without a livre—and indeed, ſaid he, without any thing but this—(pointing, as he ſaid it,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:041886_0122_101B6431F81A6570"/>
to his croix)—The poor Chevalier won my pity, and he finiſhed the ſcene, with winning my eſteem too.</p>
                     <p>The king, he ſaid, was the moſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of princes, but his generoſity could neither relieve or reward every one, and it was only his misfortune to be amongſt the number. He had a little wife, he ſaid, whom he loved, who did the <hi>patiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie;</hi> and added, he felt no diſhonour in defending her and himſelf from want in this way—unleſs Providence had offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him a better.</p>
                     <p>It would be wicked to with-hold a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure from the good, in paſſing over what happened to this poor Chevalier of St. Louis about nine months after.</p>
                     <p>It ſeems he uſually took his ſtand near the iron gates which lead up to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, and as his croix had caught the eye of numbers, numbers had made the ſame enquiry which I had done—He had told them the ſame ſtory, and always with ſo much modeſty and good ſenſe, that it had reached at laſt the king's ears— who hearing the Chevalier had been a gallant officer, and reſpected by the whole regiment as a man of honour and integrity—he broke up his little trade by a penſion of fifteen hundred livres a year.</p>
                     <p>As I have told this to pleaſe the reader, I beg he will allow me to relate another

                     <p>WHEN ſtates and empires have their periods of declenſion, and feel in their turns what diſtreſs and poverty is —I ſtop not to tell the cauſes which gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually brought the houſe d'E**** in Britany into decay. The Marquis d'E**** had fought up againſt his condition with great firmneſs; wiſhing to preſerve, and ſtill ſhew to the world ſome little frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of what his anceſtors had been— their indiſcretions had put it out of his power. There was enough left for the little exigencies of <hi>obſcurity</hi>—But he had two boys who looked up to him for <hi>light</hi> —he thought they deſerved it. He had tried his ſword—it could not open the way—the <hi>mounting</hi> was too expenſive— and ſimple oeconomy was not a match for it—there was no reſource but commerce.</p>
                     <p>In any other province in France, ſave Britany, this was ſmiting the root for ever of the little tree his pride and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection

wiſhed to ſee re-bloſſom—But in Britany, there being a proviſion for this, he availed himſelf of it; and taking an occaſion when the ſtates were aſſembled at Rennes, the Marquis, attended with his two boys, entered the court; and having pleaded the right of an ancient law of the duchy, which, though ſeldom claimed, he ſaid, was no leſs in force; he took his ſword from his ſide—Here— ſaid he—take it; and be truſty guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of it, till better times put me in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to reclaim it.</p>
                     <p>The preſident accepted the Marquis's ſword—he ſtayed a few minutes to ſee it depoſited in the archives of his houſe — and departed.</p>
                     <p>The Marquis and his whole family em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked the next day for Martinico, and in about nineteen or twenty years of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful application to buſineſs, with ſome unlooked for bequeſts from diſtant bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of his houſe—returned home to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim his nobility and to ſupport it.</p>
                     <p>It was an incident of good fortune which will never happen to any traveller, but a ſentimental one, that I ſhould be at Rennes at the very time of this ſolemn requiſition: I call it ſolemn—it was ſo to me.</p>
                     <p>The Marquis entered the court with his whole family: he ſupported his lady —his eldeſt ſon ſupported his ſiſter, and

his youngeſt was at the other extreme of the line next his mother.—he put his handkerchief to his face twice—</p>
                     <p>—There was a dead ſilence.

His ſword was given him, and the moment he got it into his hand he drew it almoſt out of the ſcab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard—'twas the ſhining face of a friend he had once given up—he looked atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively along it, beginning at the hilt, as if to ſee whether it was the ſame—when obſerving a little ruſt which it had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted near the point, he brought it near his eye, and bending his head down over it—I think I ſaw a tear fall upon the place: I could not be deceived by what followed.</p>

                     <p>I FOUND no difficulty in getting ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance to Monſieur Le Count de B****. The ſet of Shakeſpears was laid upon the table, and he was tumbling them over. I walked up cloſe to the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and giving firſt ſuch a look at the books as to make him conceive I knew what they were—I told him I had come without any one to preſent me, knowing I ſhould meet with a friend in his apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment who, I truſted, would do it for me —it is my countryman the great Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpear, ſaid I, pointing to his works—<hi>et ayez la bonte, mon cher ami,</hi> apoſtrophizing his ſpirit, added I, <hi>de me faire cet honneur la.</hi>—</p>
                     <p>The Count ſmiled at the ſingularity of the introduction; and ſeeing I looked a little pale and ſickly, inſiſted upon my taking an arm-chair: ſo I ſat down; and to ſave him conjectures upon a viſit ſo out of all rule, I told him ſimply of the incident in the bookſeller's ſhop, and how that had impelled me rather to go to him with the ſtory of a little embaraſſment I was under, than to any other man in France—And what is your embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:041886_0127_101B63F261542A60"/>
let me hear it, ſaid the Count. So I told him the ſtory juſt as I have told it the reader—</p>
                     <p>—And the maſter of my hotel, ſaid I, as I concluded it, will needs have it, Monſieur le Count, that I ſhall be ſent to the Baſtile—but I have no apprehenſions continued I—for in falling into the hands of the moſt poliſhed people in the world, and being conſcious I was a true man, and not come to ſpy the nakedneſs of the land, I ſcarce thought I laid at their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.—It does not ſuit the gallantry of the French, Monſieur le Count, ſaid I, to ſhew it againſt invalids.</p>
                     <p>An animated bluſh came into the Count de B****'s cheeks, as I ſpoke this —<hi>Ne craignez rien</hi>— Don't fear, ſaid he—Indeed I don't, replied I again—beſides, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I a little ſportingly—I have come laughing all the way from London to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, and I do not think Monſieur le Duc de Choiſeul is ſuch an enemy to mirth, as to ſend me back crying for my pains.</p>
                     <p>—My application to you, Monſieur le Compte de B**** (making him a low bow) is to deſire he will not.</p>
                     <p>The Count heard me with great good nature, or I had not ſaid half as much — and once or twice ſaid—<hi>C'eſt bien dit</hi> So I reſted my cauſe there—and determined to ſay no more about it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="33" facs="unknown:041886_0128_101B643E84BC3FF0"/>The Count led the diſcourſe: we talk'd of indifferent things;—of books and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks, and men—and then of women— God bleſs them all! ſaid I, after much diſcourſe about them—there is not a man upon earth who loves them ſo much as I do: after all the foibles I have ſeen, and all the ſatires I have read againſt them, ſtill I love them; being firmly perſuaded that a man who has not a ſort of an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for the whole ſex, is incapable of ever loving a ſingle one as he ought.</p>

                        <hi>Heh bien!

                     <p>I have ſomething within me which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear the ſhock of the leaſt indecent inſinuation: in the ſportability of chit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chat I have often endeavoured to conquer it, and with infinite pain have hazarded a thouſand things to a dozen of the ſex together—the leaſt of which I could not venture to a ſingle one, to gain heaven.</p>
                     <p>Excuſe me, Monſieur Le Count, ſaid I, —as for the nakedneſs of your land, if I ſaw it, I ſhould caſt my eyes over it with tears in them—and for that of your wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (bluſhing at the idea he had excited in me) I am ſo evangelical in this, and

have ſuch a fellow feeling for whatever is <hi>weak</hi> about them, that I would cover it with a garment, if I knew how to throw it on—But I could wiſh, continued I, to ſpy the nakedneſs of their hearts, and through the different diſguiſes of cuſtoms, climates, and religion, find out what is good in them, to faſhion my own by— and therefore am I come.</p>
                     <p>It is for this reaſon, Monſieur le Compte, continued I, that I have not ſeen the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais royal—nor the Luxembourg—nor the Facade of the Louvre—nor have attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſwell the catalogues we have of pictures, ſtatues, and churches—I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive every fair being as a temple, and would rather enter in, and ſee the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal drawings and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

ſtrength, I get off it, to ſome ſmooth vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet path which fancy has ſcattered over with roſe-buds of delights; and having taken a few turns in it, come back ſtrengthened and refreſhed—When evils preſs ſore upon me, and there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat from them in this world, then I take a new courſe—I leave it—and as I have a clearer idea of the Elyſian fields then I have of heaven, I force myſelf, like Eneas, into them—I ſee him meet the penſive ſhade of his forſaken Dido— and wiſh to recognize it—I ſee the injur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſpirit wave her head, and turn off ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent from the author of her miſeries and diſhonours—I looſe the feelings for my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in hers—and in thoſe affections which were wont to make me mourn for her when I was at ſchool.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Surely this is not walking in a vain ſhadow —nor does man diſquiet himſelf</hi> in vain, <hi>by it</hi>—he oftener does ſo in truſting the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue of his commotions to reaſon only.—I can ſafely ſay for myſelf, I was never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to conquer any one ſingle bad ſenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in my heart ſo deciſively, as by beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up as faſt as I could for ſome kindly and gentle ſenſation, to fight it upon its own ground.</p>
                     <p>When I had got to the end of the third act, the Count de B**** entered with my paſſport in his hand. Monſ. le Duc de C****, ſaid the Count, is as good a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,

                     <p>We have no jeſter at court, Monſ. Le Compte, ſaid I, the laſt we had was in the licentious reign of Charles the IId— ſince which time our manners have been ſo gradually refining, that our court at preſent is ſo full of patriots, who wiſh for <hi>nothing</hi> but the honours and wealth of their country—and our ladies are all ſo chaſte, ſo ſpotleſs, ſo good, ſo devout— —there is nothing for a jeſter to make a jeſt of—</p>

                     <p>AND how do you find the French? ſaid the Count de B****, after he had given me the paſſport.</p>
                     <p>The reader may ſuppoſe that after ſo obliging a proof of courteſy, I could not be at a loſs to ſay ſomething handſome to the enquiry.</p>
                     <p>—<hi>Mais paſſe, pour cela</hi>—ſpeak frankly, ſaid he; do you find all the urbanity in the French which the world give us the honour of?—I had found every thing I ſaid, which confirmed it—<hi>Vraiment,</hi> ſaid the Count.—<hi>Les Francois ſont polis</hi>—To an exceſs, replied I.</p>
                     <p>The Count took notice of the word <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe</hi>; and would have it I meant more than I ſaid. I defended myſelf a long time as well as I could againſt it—
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:041886_0137_101B64019B5F8D98"/>
he inſiſted I had a reſerve, and that I would ſpeak my opinion frankly.</p>
                     <p>I believe, Monſ. le Compte, ſaid I, that man has a certain compaſs, as well as an inſtrument; and that the ſocial and other calls have occaſion by turns for every key in him; ſo that if you begin a note too high or too low, there muſt be a want ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the upper or under part, to fill up the ſyſtem of harmony—The Count de B**** did not underſtand muſic, ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired me to explain it ſome other way. A poliſhed nation, my dear Count, ſaid I, makes every one its debtor; and beſides urbanity itſelf, like the fair ſex, has ſo many charms; it goes againſt the heart to ſay it can do ill; and yet, I believe, there is but a certain line of perfection, that man, take him altogether, is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to arrive at—if he gets beyond, he rather exchanges qualities than gets them. I muſt not preſume to ſay, how far this has affected the French in the ſubject we are ſpeaking of—but ſhould it ever be the caſe of the Engliſh, in the progreſs of their reſentments, to arrive at the ſame poliſh which diſtinguiſhes the French, if we did not loſe the <hi>politeſſe de coeur,</hi> which inclines men more to human actions, than courteous ones—we ſhould at leaſt loſe that dictinct variety and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginality of character, which diſtinguiſhes

them, not only from each other, but from all the world beſides.</p>
                     <p>I had a few of king William's ſhillings as ſmooth as glaſs in my pocket; and foreſeeing they would be of uſe in the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtration of my hypotheſis, I had got them into my hand, when I had procced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo far.—</p>
                     <p>See, Monſ. le Compte, ſaid I, riſing up, and laying them before him upon the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble—by jingling and rubbing one againſt another for ſeventy years together in one body's pocket or another's, they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo much alike, you can ſcarce diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſt one ſhilling from another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>The Engliſh, like antient medals kept more apart, and paſſing but few peoples hands, preſerve the firſt ſharpneſſes which the fine hand of nature has given them— they are not ſo pleaſant to feel—but in return, the legend is ſo viſible, that at the firſt look you ſee whoſe image and ſuperſcription they hear.—But the French Monſ. le Compte, added I, wiſhing to ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten what I had ſaid, have ſo many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, they can the better ſpare this— they are a loyal, a gallant, a generous, an ingenious, and good tempered people as is under heaven—if they have a fault —they are too <hi>ſerious.</hi>

                     <p>The Count ſaid he was mortified, he could not ſtay to hear my reaſons; being engaged to go that moment to dine with the duc de C****.</p>

                     <p>WHEN I alighted at the hotel, the porter told me a young woman with a band-box had been that moment enquiring for me.—I do not know, ſaid the porter, whether ſhe is gone away or

no. I took the key of my chamber of him, and went up ſtairs, and when I had got within ten ſteps of the top of the landing before my door, I meet her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eaſily down.</p>
                     <p>It was the fair <hi>fille de chambre</hi> I had walked along the Quai de Conti with: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame de R**** had ſent her upon ſome commiſſions to a <hi>merchande de modes</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a ſtep or two of the hotel de Modene; and as I had fail'd in waiting upon her, had bid her inquire if I had left Paris; and if ſo, whether I had not left a letter addreſs'd to her.</p>
                     <p>As the fair <hi>fille de chambre</hi> was ſo near my door ſhe turned back, and went into the room with me for a moment or two whilſt I wrote a card.</p>
                     <p>It was a fine ſtill evening in the latter end of the month of May—the crimſon window curtains (which were of the ſame colour of thoſe of the bed) were drawn cloſe—the ſun was ſetting and reflected through them ſo warm a tint into the fair <hi>fille de chambre</hi>'s face I thought ſhe bluſh'd—the idea of it made me bluſh my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf—we were quite alone; and that ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>induced a ſecond bluſh before the firſt could get off.</p>
                     <p>There is a ſort of a pleaſing half guilty bluſh, where the blood is more in fault than the man—'tis ſent impetuous from the heart, and virtue flies after it—not ſo

                     <p>But I'll not deſcribe it.— I felt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at firſt within me which was not in ſtrict uniſon with the leſſon of virtue I had given her the night before—I ſought five minutes for a card—I knew I had not one. —I took up a pen—I laid it down again —my hand trembled—the devil was in me.</p>
                     <p>I know as well as any one, he is an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, whom if we reſiſt, he will fly from us—but I ſeldom reſiſt him at all; from a terror, that though I may conquer, I may ſtill get a hurt in the combat—ſo I give up the triumph, for ſecurity; and inſtead of thinking to make him fly, I ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally fly myſelf.</p>
                     <p>The fair <hi>fille de chambre</hi> came cloſe up to the bureau where I was looking for a card —took up firſt the pen I caſt down, then offered to hold me the ink: ſhe offer'd it ſo ſweetly, I was going to accept it— but I durſt not—I have nothing, my dear, ſaid I, to write upon.—Write it, ſaid ſhe, ſimply, upon any thing.—</p>
                     <p>I was juſt going to cry out, then I will write it, fair girl! upon thy lips.—</p>
                     <p>If I do, ſaid I, I ſhall periſh—ſo I took her by the hand, and led her to the door, and begg'd ſhe would not forget the leſſon I had given her —ſhe ſaid, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed

ſhe would not—and as ſhe utter'd it with ſome earneſtneſs, ſhe turned about, and gave me both her hands, cloſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, into mine—it was impoſſible not to compreſs them in that ſituation—I wiſh'd to let them go; and all the time I held them, I kept arguing within myſelf againſt it—and ſtill I held them on.—In two minutes I found I had all the battle to fight over again—and I felt my legs and every limb about me tremble at the idea.</p>
                     <p>The foot of the bed was within a yard and a half of the place where we were ſtanding—I had ſtill hold of her hands —and how it happened I can give no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, but I neither aſk'd her—nor drew her— nor did I think of the bed—but ſo it did happen, we both ſet down.</p>

looking ſometimes at the purſe, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes on one ſide of it.</p>

                     <p>IF a man knows the heart, he will know it was impoſſible to go back in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to my chamber—it was touching a cold key with a flat third to it, upon the cloſe of a piece of muſick, which had called forth my affections—therefore, when I let go the hand of the <hi>fille de chambre,</hi> I remained at the gate of the hotel for ſome time, looking at every one who paſſed by, and forming conjectures upon them, till my attention got fixed upon a ſingle object which confounded all kind of reaſoning upon him.</p>
                     <p>It was a tall figure of a philoſophic ſerious, a duſt look, which paſſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed ſedately along the ſtreet, making a turn of about ſixty paces on each ſide of the gate of the hotel—the man was about fifty-two—had a ſmall cane under his arm—was dreſſed in a dark drab-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured coat, waiſtcoat, and breeches, which ſeemed to have ſeen ſome years ſervice—they were ſtill clean, and there was a little air of frugal <hi>proprete</hi> though<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him. By his pulling off his hat, and
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:041886_0146_101B6456060C04F8"/>
his attitude of accoſting a good many in his way, I ſaw he was aſking charity; ſo I got a ſous or two out of my pocket ready to give him, as he took me in his turn—he paſſed by me without aſking any thing—and yet did not go five ſteps fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before he aſked charity of a little woman—I was much more likely to have given of the two—He had ſcarce done with the woman, when he pulled off his hat to another who was coming the ſame way.—An ancient gentleman came ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly—and, after him, a young ſmart one —He let them both paſs, and aſked no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: I ſtood obſerving him half an hour, in which time he had made a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen turns backwards and forwards, and found that he invariably purſued the ſame plan.</p>
                     <p>There were two things very ſingular in this, which ſet my brain to work and to no purpoſe—the firſt was, why the man ſhould <hi>only</hi> tell his ſtory to the ſex—and ſecondly—what kind of ſtory it was, and what ſpecies of eloquence it could be, which ſoftened the hearts of the women, which he knew it was to no purpoſe to practice upon the men.</p>
                     <p>There were two other circumſtances which entangled this my myſtery—the one was, he told every woman what he had to ſay in her ear, and in a way which had much more the air of a ſecret than a

                     <p>I could form no ſyſtem to explain the phenomenon.</p>

<pb n="53" facs="unknown:041886_0148_101B645A595EDF80"/>
but my pride not ſuffering me to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any detail of the caſe, I exhorted him to let his ſoul ſleep in peace, as I reſolved to let mine do that night, and that I would diſcharge what I owed him at breakfaſt.</p>
                     <p>I ſhould not have minded, <hi>Monſieur,</hi> ſaid he, if you had had twenty girls— 'Tis a ſcore more, replied I, interrupting him, than I ever reckon'd upon—Provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, added he, it had been but in a morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.—And does the difference of the time of the day at Paris make a difference in the ſin?—It made a difference he ſaid in the ſcandal.—I like a good diſtinction in my heart; and cannot ſay I was intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably out of temper with the man.—I own it is neceſſary, re-aſſumed the maſter of the hotel, that a ſtranger at Paris ſhould have the opportunities preſented to him of buying lace and ſilk ſtockings and ruffles, <hi>et tout cela</hi>—and 'tis nothing if a woman comes with a band box.—O' my conſcience, ſaid I, ſhe had one; but I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver looked into it.—Then, <hi>Monſieur,</hi> ſaid he, has bought nothing—Not one earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing, replied I.—Becauſe, ſaid he, I could recommend one to you who would uſe you <hi>en conſcience.</hi>—But I muſt ſee her this night ſaid I.—he made me a low bow and walk'd down.</p>
                     <p>Now ſhall I triumph over this <hi>maitre de hotel,</hi> cried I—and what then?—Then I
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:041886_0149_101B649DBB83F640"/>
ſhall let him ſee I know he is a dirty fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.—And what then?—What then!—I was too near myſelf to ſay it was for the ſake of others.—I had no good anſwer left—there was more of ſpleen than prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in my project, and I was ſick of it before the execution.</p>
                     <p>In a few minutes the Griſſet came in with her box of lace—I'll buy nothing however, ſaid I, within myſelf.</p>
                     <p>The Griſſet would ſhew me every thing —I was hard to pleaſe: ſhe would not ſeem to ſee it; ſhe open'd her little ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine, laid all her laces one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before me—unfolded and folded them up again one by one with the moſt pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſweetneſs—I might buy—or not—ſhe would let me have every thing at my own price—the poor creature ſeem'd anxious to get a penny, and laid herſelf out to win me, and not ſo much in a manner which ſeem'd artful, as in one I felt ſimple and careſſing.</p>
                     <p>If there is not a fund of honeſt cullibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in man, ſo much the worſe—my heart relented, and I gave up my ſecond reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as quietly as the firſt—Why ſhould I chaſtiſe one for the treſpaſs of another? if thou art tributary to this tyrant of an hoſt, thought I, looking up in her face, ſo much harder is thy bread.</p>
                     <p>If I had not had more than four <hi>Louis d'ors</hi> in my purſe, there was no ſuch thing
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:041886_0150_101B645C0F372C10"/>
as riſing up and ſhewing her the door, till I had firſt laid three of them out in a pair of ruffles.</p>
                     <p>—The maſter of the hotel will ſhare the profit with her—no matter—then I have only paid as many a poor ſoul has <hi>paid</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me for an act he <hi>could</hi> not do, or think of.</p>

                     <head>THE RIDDLE. PARIS.</head>
                     <p>WHEN La Fleur came up to wait upon me at ſupper, he told me how ſorry the maſter of the hotel was for his affront to me in bidding me change my lodgings.</p>
                     <p>A man who values a good night's reſt will not lay down with enmity in his heart if he can help it—So I bid La Fleur tell the maſter of the hotel, that I was ſorry on my ſide for the occaſion I had given him—and you may tell him, if you will, La Fleur, added I, that if the young woman ſhould call again, I ſhall not ſee her.</p>
                     <p>This was a ſacrifice not to him, but my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, having reſolved, after ſo narrow an

eſcape, to run no more riſks, but to leave Paris, if it was poſſible, with all the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue I entered in.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>C'eſt deroger a nobleſſe, Monſieur,</hi> ſaid La Fleur, making me a bow down to the ground as he ſaid it—<hi>Et encore Monſieur,</hi> ſaid he, may change his ſentiments—and if (<hi>par hazard</hi>) he ſhould like to amuſe himſelf—I find no amuſement in it, ſaid I, interrupting him.—</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mon Dieu!</hi> ſaid La Fleur—and took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
                     <p>In an hours time he came to put me to bed, and was more than commonly offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous—ſomething hung upon his lips to ſay to me, or aſk me, which he could not get off: I could nor conceive what it was; and indeed gave myſelf little trouble to find it out, as I had another riddle ſo much more intereſting upon my mind, which was that of the man's aſking chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty before the door of the hotel—I would have given any thing to have got to the bottom of it; and that, not out of curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity—'tis ſo low a principle of enquiry, in general, I would not purchaſe the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of it with a two-ſous piece— but a ſecret, I thought, which ſo ſoon and ſo certainly ſoften'd the heart of every woman you came near, was a ſecret at leaſt equal to the philoſopher's ſtone: had I had both the Indies, I would have given, up one to have been maſter of it.</p>

                     <head>LE DIMANCHE. PARIS.</head>
                     <p>IT was Sunday; and when La Fleur came in, in the morning, with my cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee and role and butter, he had got him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo gallantly arrayed, I ſcarce knew him.</p>
                     <p>I had covenanted at Montreal to give him a new hat with a ſilver button and loop, and four Louis d'ors <hi>pour s'adoniſer,</hi> when we got to Paris; and the poor fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, to do him juſtice, had done wonders with it.</p>
                     <p>He had bought a bright, clean, good ſcarlet coat and a pair of breeches of the ſame—They were not a crown worſe, he ſaid, for the wearing—I wiſh'd him hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:041886_0153_101B64A4EBE8F780"/>
for telling me—they looked ſo freſh, that tho' I knew the thing could not be done, yet I would rather have impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my fancy with thinking I had bought them new for the fellow, than that they had come out of the <hi>Rue de friperie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is a nicety which makes not the heart ſore at Paris.</p>
                     <p>He had purchaſed moreover a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome blue ſattin waiſtcoat, fancifully e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough embroidered—this was indeed ſomething the worſe for the ſervices it had done, but 'twas clean ſcour'd—the gold had been touch'd up, and upon the whole was rather ſhowy than otherwiſe—and as the blue was not violent, it ſuited with the coat and breeches very well: he had ſqueez'd out of the money, moreover, a new bag and a ſolitaire; and had inſiſted with the <hi>fripier,</hi> upon a gold pair of gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to his breeches knees—He had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed muſlin ruffles, <hi>bien brodees,</hi> with four livres of his own money—and a pair of white ſilk ſtockings for five more—and to top all, nature had given him a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome figure, without coſting him a ſous.</p>
                     <p>He enter'd the room thus ſet off, with his hair dreſs'd in the firſt ſtile, and with a handſome <hi>bouquet</hi> in his breaſt—in a word, there was that look of feſtivity in every thing about him, which at once put me in mind it was Sunday—and by combining both together, it inſtantly

ſtruck me, that the favour he wiſh'd to aſk of me the night before, was to ſpend the day, as every body in Paris ſpent it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides. I had ſcarce made the conjecture, when la Fleur, with infinite humility, but with a look of truſt, as if I ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe him, begg'd I would grant him the day, <hi>pour faire le galant vis a vis de ſa mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now it was the very thing I intended to do myſelf <hi>vis a vis</hi> Madame de R****— I had retain'd the <hi>remiſe</hi> on purpoſe for it and it would not have mortified my vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to have had a ſervant ſo well dreſs'd as la Fleur was to have got up behind it: I never could have worſe ſpared him.</p>
                     <p>But we muſt <hi>feel,</hi> not argue in theſe embarraſſments—the ſons and daughters of ſervice part with liberty, but not with nature in their contracts; they are fleſh and blood, and have their little vanities and wiſhes in the midſt of the houſe of bondage, as well as their taſk-maſters— no doubt, they have ſet their ſelf denials at a price—and their expectations are ſo unreaſonable, that I would often diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point them, but that their condition puts it ſo much in my power to do it.</p>
                     <p>

cant'ſt thou have pick'd up in ſo little a time at Paris? La Fleur laid his hand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his breaſt, and ſaid 'twas a <hi>petite demoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle</hi> at Monſieur le Compte de B****'s— La Fleur had a heart made for ſociety; and, to ſpeak the truth of him let as few occaſions ſlip him as his maſter—ſo that ſome how or other; but how—heaven knows—he had connected himſelf with the <hi>demoiſſelle</hi> upon the landing of the ſtair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe, during the time I was taken up with my Paſſport; and as there was time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for me to win the Count to my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, la Fleur had contrived to make it do to win the maid to his—the family, it ſeems, was to be at Paris that day, and he had made a party with her, and two or three more of the Count's houſhold, upon the <hi>boulevards.</hi>

                     <p>LA Fleur had left me ſomething to amuſe myſelf with for the day more than I had bargained for, or could have entered either into his head or mine.</p>
                     <p>He had brought the little print of but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon a currant leaf; and as the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was warm, and he had a good ſtep to bring it, he had begged a ſheet of waſte paper to put betwixt the currant leaf and his hand—As that was plate ſufficient, I bad him lay it upon the table as it was, and as I reſolved to ſtay within all day I ordered him to call upon the <hi>traiteur</hi> to beſpeak my dinner, and leave me to breakfaſt by myſelf.</p>
                     <p>When I had finiſhed the butter, I threw the currant leaf out of the window, and was going to do the ſame by the waſte paper—but ſtopping to read a line firſt, and that darwing me on to a ſecond and third—I thought it better worth; ſo I ſhut the window, and drawing a chair up to it, I ſat down to read it.</p>
                     <p>It was in the old French of Rabelais's time, and for ought I know might have been wrote by him—it was moreover in a Gothic letter, and that ſo faded and gone

off by damps and length of time, it coſt me infinite trouble to make any thing of it—I threw it down; and then wrote a letter to Engenius—then I took it up again, and embroiled my patience with it afreſh— and then to cure that, I wrote a letter to Eliza.—Still it kept hold of me; and the difficulty of underſtanding it increaſed but the deſire.</p>
                     <p>I got my dinner; and after I had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened my mind with a bottle of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy, I at it again—and after two or three hours poring upon it, with almoſt as deep attention as ever Gruter or Jacob Spon did upon a nonſenſical inſcription, I thought I made ſenſe of it; but to make ſure of it, the beſt way, I imagined, was to turn it into Engliſh, and ſee how it would look then—ſo I went on leiſurely, as a trifling man does, ſometimes writing a ſentence— then taking a turn or two— and then looking how the world went, out of the window; ſo that it was nine o'clock at night before I had done it— I then begun and read it as follows.</p>

                     <p>—Now as the notary's wife diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted the point with the notary with too much heat—I wiſh, ſaid the notary, throwing down the parchment, that there was another notary here only to ſet down and atteſt all this—</p>
                     <p>—And what would you do then, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur? ſaid ſhe, riſing haſtily up—the notary's wife was a little fume of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and the notary thought it well to avoid a hurricane by a mild reply—I would go, anſwered he, to bed.—You may go to the devil, anſwered the notary's wife.</p>
                     <p>Now there happening to be but one bed in the houſe, the other two rooms being unfurniſhed, as is the cuſtom at Paris, and the notary not caring to lie in the ſame bed with a woman who had but that moment ſent him pell-mell to the devil, went forth with his hat and cane and ſhort cloak, the night being very windy, and walked out ill at eaſe towards the <hi>pont neuf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of all the bridges which ever were built, the whole world who have paſſed over the <hi>pont neuf</hi> muſt own, that it is the nobleſt—the fineſt—the grandeſt—
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:041886_0159_101B64ACA48EB038"/>
the lighteſt—the longeſt—the broadeſt that ever conjoined land and land together upon the face of the terraqueous globe.—</p>
                     <q>By this, it ſeems, as if the author of the fragment had not been a Frenchman.</q>
                     <p>The worſt fault which divines and the doctors of the Sorbonne can allege againſt it, is, that if there is but a cap-full of wind in or about Paris, 'tis more blaſphemouſly <hi>ſacro Dieu</hi>'d there than in any other aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the whole city—and with reaſon, good and cogent Meſſieurs; for it comes againſt you without crying <hi>garde d'eau,</hi> and with ſuch unpremeditable puffs, that of the few who croſs it with their hats on, not one in fifty but hazards two li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres and a half, which is its full worth.</p>
                     <p>The poor notary, juſt as he was paſſing by the ſentry, inſtinctively clapped his cane to the ſide of it, but in raiſing it up the point of his cane catching hold of the loop of the ſentinel's hat hoiſted it over the ſpikes of the balluſtrade clear into the Seine—</p>
                     <p>—<hi>'Tis an ill wind,</hi> ſaid the boatſman, who catched it, <hi>which blows no body any good.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſentry peing a gaſcon incontinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly twirled up his whiſkers, and levelled his harquebuſs.</p>
                     <p>Harquebuſſes in thoſe days went off with matches; and an old woman's pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per lanthorn at the end of the bridge

happening to be blown out, ſhe had bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed the ſentry's match to light it—it gave a moment's time for the gaſcon's blood to run cool, and turn the accident better to his advantage—<hi>'Tis an ill wind,</hi> ſaid he, catching off the notary's caſtor, and legitimating the capture with the boatman's adage.</p>
                     <p>The poor notary croſs'd the bridge, and paſſing along the rue de Dauphine into the ſauxbourgs of St. Germain, lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf as he walk'd along in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:</p>
                     <p>Lukeleſs man! that I am, ſaid the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, to be the ſport of hurricanes all my days—to be born to have the ſtorm of ill language leveſi'd againſt me and my profeſſion wherever I go—to be forced into marriage by the thunder of the church to a tempeſt of a woman—to be driven forth out of my houſe by domeſtic winds, and deſpoiled of my caſtor by pontific ones— to be here, bare-headed, in a windy night at the mercy of the ebbs and flows of accidents—where I am to lay my head? —miſerable man! what wind in the two-and-thirty points of the whole compaſs can blow unto thee, as it does to the reſt of thy fellow creatures, good!</p>
                     <p>As the notary was paſſing on by a dark paſſage, complaining in this ſort, a voice call'd out to a girl, to bid her run for the next notary—now the notary being

the next, and availing himſelf of his ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, walk'd up the paſſage to the door, and paſſing through an old ſort of a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loon, was uſhered into a large chamber diſmantled of every thing but a long mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary pike—a breaſt plate—a ruſty old ſword, and a bandoleer, hung up equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtant in four different places againſt the wall.</p>
                     <p>An old perſonage, who had hitherto been a gentleman, and unleſs decay of fortune taints the blood along with it was a gentleman at that time, lay ſupporting his head upon his hand in his bed; a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle table with a taper burning was ſet cloſe beſide it, and cloſe by the table was placed a chair—the notary ſat him down in it; and pulling out his ink-horn and a ſheet or two of paper which he had in his pocket, he placed them before him, and dipping his pen in his ink, and lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his breaſt over the table, he diſpoſed every thing to make the gentleman's laſt will and teſtament.</p>
                     <p>Alas!

                     <p>—It is a ſtory, Monſieur le Notaire, ſaid the gentleman, which will rouſe up every affection in nature—it will kill the humane, and touch the heart of cruelty herſelf with pity—</p>
                     <p>—The notary was inflamed with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to begin, and put his pen a third time into his ink-horn—and the old gentleman turning a little more towards the notary, began to dictate his ſtory in theſe words—</p>

                     <p>THE man who either diſdains or fears to walk up a dark entry may be an excellent good man, and fit for a hundred things; but he will not do to make a good ſentimental traveller. I count little of many things I ſee paſs at broad noon day, in large and open ſtreets. —Nature is ſhy, and hates to act before ſpectators; but in ſuch an unobſerved corner, you ſometimes ſee a ſingle ſhort ſcene of her's worth all the ſentiments of a dozen French plays compounded toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

—and yet they are <hi>abſoluetly</hi> fine;— and whenever I have a more brilliant af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair upon my hands than common, as they ſuit a preacher juſt as well as a hero, I generally make my ſermon out of 'em —and for the text—"Capadoſia, Pontus and Aſia, Phrygia and Pamphilia"—is as good as any one in the Bible.</p>
                     <p>There is a long dark paſſage iſſuing out from the opera comique into a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſtreet: 'tis trod by a few who hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly wait for a <hi>fiacre</hi>

At the end of it, towards the theatre, 'tis lighted by a ſmall candle, the light of which is almoſt loſt before you get half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way down, but near the door—'tis more for ornament than uſe: you ſee it as a fix'd ſtar of the leaſt magnitude; it burns —but does little good to the world, that we know of.</p>
                     <p>In returning along this paſſage, I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, as I approach'd within five or ſix paces of the door, two ladies ſtanding arm in arm, with their backs againſt the wall, waiting, as I imagined, for a <hi>fiacre</hi>—as they were next the door, I thought they had a prior right; ſo edged myſelf up within a yard or little more of them, and quietly took my ſtand—I was in black, and ſcarce ſeen.</p>

                     <p>A low voice, with a good turn of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and ſweet cadence at the end of it, begg'd for a twelve-ſous piece betwixt them, for the love of heaven. I thought it ſingular, that a beggar ſhould fix the quota of an alms—and that the ſum ſhould be twelve times as much as what is uſually given in the dark. They both ſeemed aſtoniſh'd at it as much as myſelf. —Twelve ſous! ſaid one—a twelve-ſous piece! ſaid the other—and made no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</p>

                     <p>Poo! ſaid they—we have no money.</p>
                     <p>The beggar remained ſilent for a moment or two, and renew'd his ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                     <p>Do not, my fair young ladies, ſaid he, ſtop your good ears againſt me—Upon my word, honeſt man! ſaid the younger,

we have no change—Then God bleſs you, ſaid the poor man, multiply thoſe joys which you can give to others without change!—I obſerved the elder ſiſter put her hand into her pocket—I'll ſee, ſaid ſhe, if I have a ſous—A ſous! give twelve, ſaid the ſupplicant; nature has been bountiful to you, be bountiful to a poor man.</p>
                     <p>I would, friend, with all my heart, ſaid the younger, if I had it.</p>
                     <p>My fair charitable! ſaid he, addreſſing himſelf to the elder—What is it but your goodneſs and humanity which makes your bright eyes ſo ſweet, that they out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine the morning even in this dark paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage? and what was it which made the Marquis de Santerre and his brother ſay ſo much of you both as they juſt paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by?</p>
                     <p>The two ladies ſeemed much affected; and impulſively at the ſame time they both put their hands into their pocket, and each took out a twelve-ſous piece.</p>
                     <p>The conteſt betwixt them and the poor ſupplicant was no more—it was continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed betwixt themſelves, which of the two ſhould give the twelve-ſous piece in chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty—and to end the diſpute, they both gave it together, and the man went away.</p>

                     <p>Monſ. Le Compte de B****, merely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had done me one kindneſs in the affair of my paſſport, would go on and do me another, the few days he was at Paris, in making me known to a few people of rank; and they were to preſent me to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and ſo on.</p>
                     <p>I had got maſter of my <hi>ſecret,</hi> juſt in time to turn theſe honours to ſome little account; otherwiſe, as is commonly the caſe, I ſhould have din'd or ſupp'd a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle time or two round, and then by <hi>tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating</hi> French looks and attitudes into plain Engliſh, I ſhould preſently have ſeen, that I had got hold of the <hi>convert</hi>

                     <p>I had the honour of being introduced
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:041886_0170_101B64798677DA70"/>
to the old Marquis de B****: in days of yore he had ſignaliz'd himſelf by ſome ſmall feats of chivalry in the <hi>Cour d'amour,</hi> and had dreſs'd himſelf out to the idea of tilts and tournaments ever ſince—the Marquis de B**** wiſh'd to have it thought the affair was ſomewhere elſe than in his brain.
<q>He could like to take a trip to England,</q>
and aſk'd much of the Engliſh ladies. Stay where you are, I beſeech you, Monſ. le Marquiſe, ſaid I—Les Meſſrs. Angloiſe can ſcarce get a kind look from them as it is.—The Marquis invited me to ſupper.</p>
                     <p>Monſ. P**** the farmer general was juſt as inquiſitive about our taxes.—They were very conſiderable, he heard—If we knew but how to collect them, ſaid I, making him a low bow.</p>
                     <p>I could never have been invited to Monſ. P****'s concerts upon any other terms.</p>
                     <p>I had been miſrepreſented to Madame de Q*** as an <hi>eſprit</hi>—Madame de Q*** was an <hi>eſprit</hi> herſelf; ſhe burnt with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience to ſee me, and hear me talk. I had not taken my ſeat, before I ſaw ſhe did not care a ſous whether I had any wit or no—I was let in, to be convinced ſhe had.—I call heaven to witneſs I never once open'd the door of my lips.</p>
                     <p>Madame de Q**** vow'd to every creature ſhe met,
<q>She had never had a

                     </p>
                     <p>There are three epochas in the empire of a French-woman—ſhe is coquette—then deiſt—then <hi>dvote:</hi> the empire during theſe is never loſt—ſhe only changes her ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: when thirty-five years and more have unpeopled her dominions of the ſlaves of love, ſhe re-peoples it with ſlaves of infidelity—and then with the ſlaves of the church.</p>
                     <p>Madame de V**** was vibrating be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the firſt of theſe epochas: the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the roſe was ſhading faſt away— —ſhe ought to have been a deiſt five years before the time I had the honour to pay my firſt viſit.</p>
                     <p>She placed me upon the ſame ſopha with her, for the ſake of diſputing the point of religion more cloſely.—In ſhort Madame de V*** told me ſhe believed nothing.</p>
                     <p>I told Madame de V***it might be her principle; but I was ſure it could not be her intereſt to level the outworks, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which I could not conceive how ſuch a citadel as hers could be defended—that there was not a more dangerous thing in the world, than for a beauty to be a deiſt —that it was a debt I owed my creed, not to conceal it from her—that I had not been five minutes ſat upon the ſopha beſides her, but I had begun to form de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:041886_0172_101B647D95EC1750"/>
— and what is it, but the ſentiments of religion, and the perſuaſion they had exiſted in her breaſt, which could have check'd them as they roſe up.</p>
                     <p>We are not adamant, ſaid I, taking hold of her hand—and there is need of all reſtraints, till age in her own time ſteals in and lays them on us—but, my dear lady, ſaid I, kiſſing her hand—'tis too—too ſoon—</p>
                     <p>I declare I had the credit all over Paris of unperverting Madame de V***.—She affirmed to Monſ. D*** and the Abbe M***, that in one half hour I had ſaid more for revealed religion, than all their Encyclopedia had ſaid againſt it—I was liſted directly into Madame de V***'s <hi>Conterie</hi>—and ſhe put off the epocha of deiſin for two years.</p>
                     <p>I remember it was in this <hi>Conterie,</hi> in the middle of a diſcourſe, in which I was ſhewing the neceſſity of a firſt cauſe, that the young Count de Faineant took me by the hand to the furtheſt corner of the room, to tell me my <hi>ſolitaire</hi> was pin'd too ſtrait about my neck—It ſhould be <hi>plus badinant,</hi> ſaid the Count, looking down upon his own—but a word, Monſ.

                     <p>—And from the wiſe, Monſ. le Compte replied I, making him a bow—<hi>is enough.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Count de Faineant embraced me
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:041886_0173_101B64C10517AA48"/>
with more ardour than ever I was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced by mortal man.</p>
                     <p>For three weeks together, I was of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man's opinion I met.—<hi>Pardi! ce Monſ.

vintage, when nature is pouring her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance into every one's lap, and every eye is lifted up—a journey through each ſtep of which muſic beats time to <hi>labour,</hi> and all her children are rejoicing as they carry in their cluſters—to paſs through this with my affections flying out, and kindling at every group before me—and every one of 'em was pregnant with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures.</p>
                     <p>Juſt heaven!—it would fill up twenty volumes—and alas! I have but a few ſmall pages left of this to croud it into— and half of theſe muſt be taken up with the poor Maria my friend, Mr. Shandy, met with near Moulines,</p>
                     <p>The ſtory he had told me of that diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd maid, affected me not a little in the reading; but when I got within the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood where ſhe lived, it returned ſo ſtrong into my mind, that I could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt an impulſe which prompted me to go half a league out of the road to the village where her parents dwelt to enquire after her.</p>
                     <p>'Tis going, I own, like the Knight of the Woeful Countenance, in queſt of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy adventures—but I know not how it is, but I am never ſo perfectly conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of the exiſtence of a ſoul within me, as when I am entangled in them.</p>

<pb n="80" facs="unknown:041886_0175_101B64C3DCE4E960"/>
her mouth—ſhe had loſt her huſband; he had died, ſhe ſaid, of anguiſh, for the loſs of Maria's ſenſes about a month be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore—She had feared at firſt, ſhe added, that it would have plundered her poor girl of what little underſtanding was left —but, on the contrary, it had brought her more to herſelf—ſtill ſhe could not reſt—her poor daughter, ſhe ſaid, crying, was wandering ſomewhere about the road.</p>
                     <p>—Why does my pulſe beat languid as I write this? and what made La Fleur, whoſe heart ſeemed only to be turn'd to joy, to paſs the back of his hand twice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſs his eyes, as the woman ſtood and told it? I beckon'd to the poſtilion to turn back into the road.</p>
                     <p>When we had got within half a league of Moulines, at a little opening in the road leading to a thicket, I diſcovered poor Maria ſitting under a poplar—ſhe was ſitting with her elbow in her lap, and her head leaning on one ſide within her hand—a ſmall brook ran at the foot of the tree.</p>
                     <p>I bid the poſtilion go on with the chaiſe to Moulines—and La Fleur to beſpeak my ſupper—and that I would walk after him.</p>
                     <p>She was dreſs'd in white, and much as my friend deſcribed her, except that her hair hung looſe, which before was twiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within a ſilk net.—She had, ſuperadd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed likewiſe to her jacket, a pale green

ribband which fell acroſs her ſhoulder to the waiſt; at the end of which hung her pipe.—Her goat had been as faithleſs as her lover; and ſhe had got a little dog in lieu of him, which ſhe had kept tied by a ſtring to her girdle; as I look'd at her dog, ſhe drew him towards her with the ſtring.—
<q>Thou ſhalt not leave me, Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio,</q>
ſaid ſhe. I look'd in Maria's eyes, and ſaw ſhe was thinking more of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than of her lover or little goat; for as ſhe utter'd them the tears trickled down her cheeks.</p>
                     <p>I ſat down cloſe by her; and Maria let me wipe them away as they fell with my handkerchief.—I then ſteep'd it in my own—and then in hers—and then in mine—and then I wip'd hers again—and as I did it, I felt ſuch undeſcribable emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions within me, as I am ſure could not be accounted for from any combinations of matter and motion.</p>

                     <p>She had ſince that, ſhe told me, ſtray'd as far as Rome, and walk'd round St. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's once—and return'd back—that ſhe found her way alone acroſs the Apennines —had travell'd over all Lombardy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out money—and through the flinty roads of Savoy without ſhoes—how ſhe had borne it, and how ſhe had got ſupported,

                     <p>Shorn indeed! and to the quick, ſaid I; and waſt thou in my own land, where I have a cottage, I would take thee to it and ſhelter thee: thou ſhouldſt eat of my own bread, and drink of my own cup—I would be kind to thy Sylvio—in all thy weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and wanderings I would ſeek after thee and bring thee back—when the ſun went down I would ſay my prayers, and when I had done thou ſhouldſt play thy evening ſong upon thy pipe, nor would the incenſe of my ſacrifice be worſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted for entering heaven along with that of a broken heart.</p>
                     <p>Nature melted within me, as I utter'd this; and Maria obſerving, as I took out my handkerchief, that it was ſteep'd too much already to be of uſe, would needs go waſh it in the ſtream.—And where will you dry it, Maria? ſaid I—I'll dry it in my boſom, ſaid ſhe—'twill do me good.</p>

                     <p>I touch'd upon the ſtring on which hung all her ſorrows—ſhe look'd with wiſtful diſorder for ſome time in my face; and then, without ſaying any thing, took her pipe, and play'd her ſervice to the virgin—The ſtring I had touch'd ceaſed to vibrate—in a moment or two Maria

                     <p>And where art thou going, Maria? ſaid I.—She ſaid to Moulines.—Let us go, ſaid I, together.—Maria put her arm within mine, and lengthening the ſtring to let the dog follow—in that order we entered Moulines.</p>

                     <head>THE SUPPER.</head>
                     <p>A SHOE coming looſe from the fore-foot of the thill-horſe, at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the aſcent of Mount Taurira, the poſtilion diſmounted, twiſted the ſhoe off, and put it in his pocket; as the aſcent was of five or ſix miles, and that horſe our main dependence, I made a point of having the ſhoe faſten'd on again, as well as we could; but the poſtilion had thrown away the nails, and the hammer in the chaiſe box, being of no great uſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, I ſubmitted to go on.</p>
                     <p>He had not mounted half a mile high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, when coming to a flinty piece of road, the poor devil loſt a ſecond ſhoe, and from off his other fore-foot; I then got out of the chaiſe in good earneſt; and ſeeing a houſe about a quarter of a mile to the left-hand, with a great deal to do, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon the poſtilion to turn up to it. The look of the houſe, and of every thing about it, as we drew nearer, ſoon reconciled me to the diſaſter.—It was a little farm-houſe ſurrounded with about twenty acres of vineyard, about as much corn—and cloſe to the houſe, on one ſide, was a potagerie of an acre and a half, full of every thing which could make plenty in a French peaſants houſe—and
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:041886_0183_101B64D08C763368"/>
on the other ſide was a little wood which furniſhed wherewithal to dreſs it. It was about eight in the evening whew I got to the houſe—ſo I left the poſtilion to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage his point as he could—and for mine, I walk'd directly into the houſe.</p>
                     <p>The family conſiſted of an old grey-headed man and his wife, with five or ſix ſons and ſons-in-law and their ſeveral wives, and a joyous genealogy out of 'em.</p>
                     <p>They were all ſitting down together to their lentil-ſoup; a large wheaten loaf was in the middle of the table; and a flaggon of wine at each end of it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed joy thro' the ſtages of the repaſt —'twas a feaſt of love.</p>
                     <p>The old man roſe up to meet me, and with a reſpectful cordiality would have me ſit down at the table; my heart was ſat down the moment I entered the room; ſo I ſat down at once like a ſon of the family: and to inveſt myſelf in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter as ſpeedily as I could, I inſtantly borrowed the old man's knife, and taking up the loaf cut myſelf a hearty lun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheon; and as I did it I ſaw a teſtimony in every eye, not only of an honeſt wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, but of a welcome mixed with thanks that I had not ſeemed to doubt it.</p>
                     <p>Was it this; or tell me, Nature, what elſe it was which made this morſel ſo ſweet—and to what magick I owe it, that the draught I took of their flaggon was
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:041886_0184_101B6490353AEC30"/>
ſo delicious with it, that they remain upon my palate to this hour?</p>
                     <p>If the ſupper was to my taſte—the grace which followed was much more ſo.</p>

                     <p>WHEN ſupper was over, the old man gave a knock upon the table with the haft of his knife—to bid them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for the dance: the moment the ſignal was given, the women and girls ran all together into a back apartment to tye up their hair—and the young men to the door to waſh their faces, and change their ſabots; and in three minutes every ſoul was ready upon a little eſplanade be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the houſe to begin—The old man and his wife came out laſt, and, placing me betwixt them, ſat down upon a ſopha of turf by the door.</p>
                     <p>The old man had ſome fifty years ago been no mean performer upon the vielle —and at the age he was then of, touched it well enough for the purpoſe. His wife ſung now-and-then a little to the tune— then intermitted—and joined her old man again as their children and grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>children danced before them.</p>

a couple of mules, and convey me in my own chaiſe ſafe to Turin through Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy.</p>
                     <p>Poor, patient, quiet, honeſt people! fear not; your poverty, the treaſury of your ſimple virtues, will not be envied you by the world, nor will your vallies be invaded by it.—Nature! in the midſt of thy diſorders, thou are ſtill friendly to the ſcantineſs thou haſt created—with all thy great works about thee, little haſt thou left to give, either to the ſcithe or to the ſickle—but to that little, thou granteſt ſafety add protection; ſweet are the dwellings which ſtand ſo ſheltered.</p>
                     <p>Let the way-worn traveller vent his complaints upon the ſudden turns and dangers of your roads—your rocks—your precipices—the difficulties of getting up—the horrors of getting down—moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains impracticable—and cataracts, which roll down great ſtones from their ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, and block up his road—The pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants had been all day at work in remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a fragment of this kind between St. Michael and Madane; and by the time my Voiturn got to the place, it wanted full two hours of compleating before a paſſage could any how be gained: there was nothing but to wait with patience— 'twas a wet and tempeſtuous night; ſo that by the delay, and that together, the Voiturin found himſelf obliged to take

up five miles ſhort of his ſtage at a little decent kind of an inn by the road ſide.</p>
                     <p>I forthwith took poſſeſſion of my bed-chamber—got a good fire—ordered ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; and was thanking heaven it was no worſe—when a voiture arrived with a lady in it and her ſervant-maid.</p>
                     <p>As there was no other bed-chamber in the houſe, the hoſteſs, without much nicety led them into mine, telling them, as ſhe uſhered them in, that there was no body in it but an Engliſh gentleman— that there were two good beds in it, and a cloſet within the room which held a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother—the accent in which ſhe ſpoke of this third bed did not ſay much for it— however, ſhe ſaid, there were three beds, and but three people—and ſhe durſt ſay, the gentleman would do any thing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate matters—I left not the lady a moment to make a conjecture about it— ſo inſtantly made a declaration I would do any thing in my power.</p>
                     <p>As this did not amount to an abſolute ſurrender of my bed-chamber, I ſtill felt myſelf ſo much the proprietor, as to have a right to do the honours of it—ſo I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the lady to ſit down—preſſed her into the warmeſt ſeat—called for more wood—deſired the hoſteſs to enlarge the plan of the ſupper, and to favour us with the very beſt wine.</p>
                     <p>The lady had ſcarce warmed herſelf
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:041886_0188_101B6494C231CC50"/>
five minutes at the fire, before ſhe began to turn her head back, and give a look at the beds; and the oftener ſhe caſt her eyes that way, the more they returned perplexed—I felt for her—and for my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; for in a few minutes, what by her looks, and the caſe itſelf, I found myſelf as much embarraſſed as it was poſſible the lady could be herſelf.</p>
                     <p>That the beds we were to lay in were in one and the ſame room, was enough ſimply by itſelf to have excited all this— but the poſition of them, for they ſtood parallel, and ſo very cloſe to each other as only to allow ſpace for a ſmall wicker chair bewtixt them, render'd the affair ſtill more opproſſive to us—they were fixed up moreover near the fire, and the projection of the chimney on one ſide, and a large beam which croſs'd the room on the other, form'd a kind of receſs for them that was no way favourable to the nicety of our ſenſations—if any thing could have added to it, it was, that the two beds were both of 'em ſo very ſmall, as to cut us off from every idea of the lady and maid lying together; which in either of them, could it have been feaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, my lying beſides them, tho' a thing not to be wiſh'd, yet there was nothing in it ſo terrible which the imagination might not have paſs'd over without tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="94" facs="unknown:041886_0189_101B64D8451FA928"/>As for the little room within, it offer'd little or no conſolation to us; 'twas a damp cold cloſet, with a half diſmantled window ſhutter, and with a window which had neither glaſs or oil paper in it to keep out the tempeſt of the night. I did not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſtifle my cough when the lady gave a peep into it; ſo it reduced the caſe in courſe to this alternative—that the lady ſhould ſacrifice her health to her felings, and take up with the cloſet herſelf, and abandon the bed next mine to her maid —or that the girl ſhould take the cloſet, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The lady was a Piedmonteſe of about thirty, with a glow of health in her cheeks.—The maid was a Lyonoſe of twenty, and as briſk and lively a French girl as ever moved.—There were difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties every way—and the obſtacle of the ſtone in the road, which brought us into the diſtreſs, great as it appeared whilſt the peaſants were removing it, was but a pebble to what lay in our ways now—I have only to add, that it did not leſſen the weight which hung upon our ſpirits, that we were both too delicate to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate what we felt to each other up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the occaſion.</p>
                     <p>We ſat down to ſupper; and had we not had more generous wine to it than a little inn in Savoy cold have furniſh'd, our tongues had been tied up, till neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:041886_0190_101B649773E00B68"/>
herſelf had ſet them at liberty—but the lady having a few bottles of Burdun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in her voiture ſent down her Fille de Chambre for a couple of them; ſo that by the time ſupper was over, and we were left alone, we felt ourſelves inſpired with a ſtrength of mind ſufficient to talk, at leaſt, without reſerve upon our ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. We turn'd it every way, and debat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and conſidered it in all kind of lights in the courſe of a two hours negociati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; at the end of which the articles were ſettled finally betwixt us, and ſtipulated for in form and manner of a treaty of peace—and I believe with as much religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and good faith on both ſides, as in any treaty which as yet had the honour of being handed down to poſterity.</p>
                     <p>They were as follows:</p>
                     <p>Firſt. As the right of the bedchamber is in Monſieur—and he thinking the bed next to the fire to be the warmeſt, he inſiſts upon the conceſſion on the lady's ſide of taking up with it.</p>
                     <p>Granted, on the part of Madame; with a proviſo, that as the curtains of that bed are of a flimſy tranſparent cotton and appear likewiſe too ſcanty to draw cloſe, that the Fille de Chambre, ſhall faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en up the opening, either by corking pins, or needle and thread, in ſuch manner as ſhall be deemed a ſufficient barrier on the ſide of Monſieur.</p>

                        <pb n="96" facs="unknown:041886_0191_101B64DCE875AE68"/>2dly. It is required on the part of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, that Monſieur ſhall lay the whole night through in his robe de chambre.</p>
                     <p>Rejected: inaſmuch Monſieur is not worth a robe de chambre; he having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in his portmanteau but ſix ſhirts and a black ſilk pair of breeches.</p>
                     <p>The mentioning the ſilk pair of breeches made an entire change of the articles— for the breeches were accepted as an equivalent for the robe de chambre, and ſo it was ſtipulated and agreed upon that I ſhould lay in my black ſilk breeches all night.</p>
                     <p n="3">3dly, It was inſiſted upon, and ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated for by the lady, that after Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur was got to bed, and the candle and fire extinguiſhed, that Monſieur ſhould not ſpeak one ſingle word the whole night.</p>
                     <p>Granted; provided Monſieur's ſaying his prayers might not be deem'd an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraction of treaty.</p>
                     <p>There was but one point forgot in this treaty, and that was the manner in which the lady and myſelf ſhould be obliged to undreſs and get to bed—there was but one way of doing it, and that I leave to the reader to deviſe; proteſting as I do it, that if it is not the moſt delicate in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, 'tis the fault of his own imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on—againſt which this is not my firſt complaint.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="97" facs="unknown:041886_0192_101B649C1F5FA978"/>Now when we were got to bed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was the novelty of the ſituation, or what it was, I know not; but ſo it was, I could not ſhut my eyes; I tried this ſide and that, and turn'd and turn'd again, till a full hour after midnight; when na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and patience both wearing out—O my God! ſaid I—</p>
                     <p>—You have broke the treaty, Monſieur, ſaid the lady, who had no more ſlept than myſelf—I begg'd a thouſand pardons— but inſiſted it was no more than an eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation—ſhe maintain'd 'twas an entire infraction of the treaty—I maintained it was provided for in the clauſe of the third article.</p>
                     <p>The lady would by no means give up her point, tho' ſhe weakened her barrier by it; for in the warmth of the diſpute, I could hear two or three corking pins fall out of the curtain to the ground.</p>
                     <p>Upon my word and honour, Madame, ſaid I—ſtretching my arm out of bed by way of aſſeveration—</p>
                     <p>—(I was going to have added, that I would not have treſpaſſed againſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteſt idea of decorum for the world)—</p>
                     <p>—But the Fille de Chambre hearing there were words between us, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that hoſtilities would enſue in courſe, had crept ſilently out of her cloſet, and it being totally dark, had ſtolen ſo cloſe to our beds, that ſhe had got herſelf into
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:041886_0193_101B64DEB0506880"/>
the narrow paſſage which ſeparated them, and had advanced ſo far up as to be in a line betwixt her miſtreſs and me.—</p>
                     <p>So that when I ſtretched out my hand, I caught hold of the Fille de Chambre's.</p>
